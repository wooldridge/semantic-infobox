	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Philip Schuyler Green (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a>) is a widowed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist" title="Journalist">journalist</a> who has just moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> with his son Tommy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Stockwell" title="Dean Stockwell">Dean Stockwell</a>) and mother (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Revere" title="Anne Revere">Anne Revere</a>). Green meets with magazine publisher John Minify (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Dekker" title="Albert Dekker">Albert Dekker</a>), who asks Green to write an article on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a>. After initially struggling with how to approach the topic in a fresh way, Green is inspired to adopt a Jewish identity ("Phil Greenberg") and write about his own first-hand experiences. Green and Minify agree to keep it secret that Phil is not Jewish; since he and his family are new to New York, it should be easy to hide.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At a dinner party, Phil meets Minify's divorced niece Kathy Lacey (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_McGuire" title="Dorothy McGuire">Dorothy McGuire</a>), who turns out to be the person who originally suggested the story idea. Minify provides her with a large apartment and money. Kathy "works" as a pre-school teacher. Phil and Kathy begin dating. Though she seems to have <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States" title="Liberalism in the United States">liberal</a> views, when he reveals what he intends to do, she is taken aback and asks if he actually is Jewish. The strain on their relationship due to Kathy's subtle acquiescence to bigotry becomes a key theme in the film.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the magazine, Phil is assigned a secretary, Elaine Wales (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Havoc" title="June Havoc">June Havoc</a>), who reveals that she too is Jewish. She changed her name in order to get the job (her application under her real, Jewish-sounding name, Estelle Wilovsky, was rejected). After Phil informs Minify about Wales' experience, Minify orders the magazine to adopt hiring policies that are open to Jews. Wales has reservations about the new policy, fearing that the "wrong Jews" will be hired and ruin things for the few Jews working there now. Phil meets fashion editor Anne Dettrey (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_Holm" title="Celeste Holm">Celeste Holm</a>), who becomes a good friend and potentially more, particularly as strains develop between Phil and Kathy.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Phil's assignment proceeds, his childhood friend, Dave Goldman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Garfield" title="John Garfield">John Garfield</a>), who is Jewish, moves to New York for a job and lives with the Greens while he looks for a home for his family. Housing is scarce in the city, but it is particularly difficult for Goldman, since not all landlords will rent to a Jewish family. When Phil tells Dave about his project, Dave is supportive, but concerned.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As time goes on, Phil experiences several incidents of bigotry. When his mother becomes ill with a heart condition, the doctor discourages him from consulting a specialist with an obviously Jewish name, suggesting he might be cheated. When Phil reveals that he is himself Jewish, the doctor becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Also, when Phil wants to celebrate his honey moon at a swanky hotel for rich people in the country, the manager of the hotel refuses to register Phil, due to his being a Jew. Also, when kids at school learn that Tommy is Jewish, he becomes the target of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying" title="Bullying">bullies</a>. Phil is troubled by the way Kathy consoles Tommy, telling him that their taunts of "dirty Jew" are wrong because he isn't Jewish, not that the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithet" title="Epithet">epithet</a> is wrong in and of itself.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kathy's attitudes are revealed further when she and Phil announce their engagement. Her sister Jane (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Wyatt" title="Jane Wyatt">Jane Wyatt</a>) invites them to a celebration in her home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darien,_Connecticut" title="Darien, Connecticut">Darien, Connecticut</a>, which is known to be a "restricted" community where Jews are not welcome. Fearing an awkward scene, Kathy wants to tell her family and friends that Phil is only pretending to be a Jew, but Phil prevails on Kathy to tell only Jane. At the party, everyone is very friendly to Phil, though many people are "unable" to attend at the last minute.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zanuck decided to make a film version of Hobson's novel after being refused membership in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Country_Club" title="Los Angeles Country Club">Los Angeles Country Club</a> when it was assumed incorrectly that he was Jewish. Before filming commenced, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn" title="Samuel Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a> and other Jewish film executives approached Darryl Zanuck and asked him not to make the film, fearing that it would "stir up trouble". They also warned that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Code" title="Hays Code">Hays Code</a> enforcer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Breen" title="Joseph Breen">Joseph Breen</a> might not allow the film to pass the censors, as he had been known to make disparaging remarks about Jews. There was also concern that Dorothy McGuire's character being divorced would offend the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Legion_of_Decency" title="National Legion of Decency">National Legion of Decency</a>. The role of Phillip Green was first offered to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a>, but he turned it down. Peck decided to accept the role, although his agent advised him to refuse, believing he would be endangering his career. Jewish actor John Garfield agreed to play a lesser role in the film in order to be a part of the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was shot on location in Darien, Connecticut.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Gentleman's Agreement</i> received a generally favorable reception from influential <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">New York Times</a></i> critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a>. Crowther said that "every point about prejudice which Miss Hobson had to make in her book has been made with superior illustration and more graphic demonstration in the film, so that the sweep of her moral indignation is not only widened but intensified thereby."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crowther said that the movie shared the novel's failings in that "explorations are narrowly confined to the upper-class social and professional level to which he is immediately exposed." He also said that the main character's shock at the extent of antisemitism was lacking in credibility: "it is, in a careful analysis, an extraordinarily naive role."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to winning Academy Awards for best picture and best director, <i>Gentleman's Agreement</i> was one of Fox's highest grossing movies of 1947. The political nature of the film, however, upset the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee" title="House Un-American Activities Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_Kazan" title="Elia Kazan">Elia Kazan</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_F._Zanuck" title="Darryl F.

Both Garfield and Revere refused to testify and were placed on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Blacklist" title="Hollywood Blacklist">Hollywood Blacklist</a>. Revere did not appear in another movie for twenty years. Garfield remained on the blacklist for one year, was called again to testify against his wife, and died of a heart attack at the age of 39 before his second hearing date.</p>
