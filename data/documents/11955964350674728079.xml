      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Winger was born as Mary Debra Winger in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Heights,_Ohio" title="Cleveland Heights, Ohio">Cleveland Heights, Ohio</a> into an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Jewish</a> family, to Robert Winger, a meat packer, and Ruth Felder, an office manager. She has stated publicly and with amusement that the Internet has a growing "snowball" of claims that she had been part of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz" title="Kibbutz">kibbutz</a> in Israel, whereas she was merely on a typical Israeli youth program that visited the kibbutz.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the years, Winger acquired a reputation for being outspoken and sometimes difficult to work with. She has expressed her dislike of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Officer_and_a_Gentleman" title="An Officer and a Gentleman">An Officer and a Gentleman</a></i>, for which she refused to do any publicity, and several other of her films, and has been dismissive of some of her co-stars and directors. Commenting on her past attitudes, Winger said in 2009, "Most bad behaviour comes from insecurity. Even though I loved what I was doing, I didn't always know I could pull it off. (...) I took [my insecurities out] on everybody. But, in my defence, I never fought about the size of my trailer or things like that; it was always about the work".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Winger was cast in the lead role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_League_of_their_Own" title="A League of their Own">A League of their Own</a></i> but dropped out and was replaced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geena_Davis" title="Geena Davis">Geena Davis</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1995, Winger decided to take a hiatus from acting. In 2002 she said, "I wanted out for years. I got sick of hearing myself say I wanted to quit. It's like opening an interview with "I hate interviews!" Well, get out! I stopped reading scripts and stopped caring. People said, "We miss you so much." But in the last six years, tell me a film that I should have been in. The few I can think of, the actress was so perfect". After making <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forget_Paris" title="Forget Paris">Forget Paris</a></i> in 1995, she was absent from the screen for six years, before returning in 2001 with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bad_Love" title="Big Bad Love">Big Bad Love</a></i>.</p>

Zack decides to DOR himself but Foley won't let him go so close to graduation. He and Zack clash in an unofficial martial arts bout with the platoon looking on. Although Zack dominates for most of the fight, Foley manages to win by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin_attack" title="Groin attack">kicking Zack in the groin</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Director Taylor Hackford kept Lou Gossett Jr. in separate living quarters from the other actors during <i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i> so he could intimidate them more during his scenes as a drill instructor.</p>

Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Hackford" title="Taylor Hackford">Taylor Hackford</a> agreed with Gere until, during a rehearsal, the extras playing the workers began to cheer and cry.

The main difference is that a majority of the foul language is edited out when the film airs on regular television. However, the group marching song near the beginning of the film and Mayo's solo marching song are not voiceover edits; they are reshoots of those scenes for television. Also, the sex scene between Mayo and Paula is cut in half, and the scene where Mayo finds Sid's body is also edited.</p>
