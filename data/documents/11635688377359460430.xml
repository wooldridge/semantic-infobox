One of the pageant judges said she should quit school and move to New York City to become a fashion model. When her mother heard this, she agreed, and, in 1977 Stone left Meadville, moving in with an aunt in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>. Within four days of her arrival in New Jersey, she was signed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Modeling_Agency" title="Ford Modeling Agency">Ford Modeling Agency</a> in New York.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While living in Europe, she decided to quit modeling and become an actress. "So I packed my bags, moved back to New York, and stood in line to be an extra in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a> movie," she later recalled. While auditioning, she met <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer" title="Michelle Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>, who recognized her from the pageant she competed in, and the two became friends. Stone was cast for a brief role in Allen's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_Memories" title="Stardust Memories">Stardust Memories</a></i> (1980), and then had a speaking part a year later in the horror movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_Blessing" title="Deadly Blessing">Deadly Blessing</a></i> (1981). When French director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Lelouch" title="Claude Lelouch">Claude Lelouch</a> saw Stone in <i>Stardust Memories,</i> he was so impressed that he cast her in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Uns_et_les_Autres" title="Les Uns et les Autres">Les Uns et les Autres</a></i> (1982) starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caan_(actor)" title="James Caan (actor)">James Caan</a>. She was only on screen for two minutes and did not appear in the credits.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After starring on the short-lived TV series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_City_Blues" title="Bay City Blues">Bay City Blues</a></i> in 1983, her next film role was in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreconcilable_Differences" title="Irreconcilable Differences">Irreconcilable Differences</a></i> (1984), starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_O%27Neal" title="Ryan O'Neal">Ryan O'Neal</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Long" title="Shelley Long">Shelley Long</a>, and a young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Barrymore" title="Drew Barrymore">Drew Barrymore</a>. Stone played a starlet who breaks up the marriage of a successful director and his screenwriter wife.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through the rest of the 1980s she appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Solomon%27s_Mines_(1985_film)" title="King Solomon's Mines (1985 film)">King Solomon's Mines</a></i> (1985), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Academy_4:_Citizens_on_Patrol" title="Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol">Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol</a></i> (1987), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Quatermain_and_the_Lost_City_of_Gold" title="Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold">Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold</a></i> (1987), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Jackson" title="Action Jackson">Action Jackson</a></i> (1988), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_the_Law_(film)" title="Above the Law (film)">Above the Law</a></i> (1988). Stone was nominated for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razzie_Award_for_Worst_Actress" title="Razzie Award for Worst Actress">Razzie Award for Worst Actress</a> for her performance in <i>Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also in 1988, Stone took over the role of Janice Henry for the filming of the miniseries <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Remembrance" title="War and Remembrance">War and Remembrance</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her appearance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Recall" title="Total Recall">Total Recall</a></i> (1990) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> gave Stone's career a jolt. To coincide with the movie's release, she posed nude for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i>, showing off the muscles she developed in preparation for the movie (she lifted weights and learned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo" title="Taekwondo">taekwondo</a>). In 1999, she was rated among the 25 sexiest stars of the century by <i>Playboy</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role that made her a star was that of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Tramell" title="Catherine Tramell">Catherine Tramell</a>, a brilliant, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality" title="Bisexuality">bisexual</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a>, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Instinct" title="Basic Instinct">Basic Instinct</a></i> (1992). Stone had to wait and actually turned down other offers for the mere prospect to play Tramell (the part was offered to 13 other actresses and considered to 150 women before being offered to Stone). Several better known actresses of the time turned down the part mostly because of the nudity required. In the movieâ€™s most notorious scene, Tramell is being questioned by the police and she crosses and uncrosses her legs, revealing the fact she is not wearing any underwear. According to Stone, upon seeing her own <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva" title="Vulva">vulva</a> in the leg-crossing scene during a screening of the film, she went into the projection booth and slapped director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Verhoeven" title="Paul Verhoeven">Paul Verhoeven</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone claimed that although she agreed to film the flashing scene with no panties, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene from the beginning of production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be. She said, "I knew that we were going to do this leg-crossing thing and I knew that we were going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it in a room full of strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went into the booth and slapped him and left."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite this, she claimed in an earlier interview that "it was so fun" watching the film for the first time with strangers. Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, "As much as I love her, I hate her too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot between her legs, which was a straight lie". Screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Eszterhas" title="Joe Eszterhas">Joe Eszterhas</a>, who later befriended the actress, also claimed the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved in his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir" title="Memoir">memoir</a>, <i>Hollywood Animal</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following this film, she was listed by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_magazine" title="People magazine">People</a></i> as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1992, photographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hurrell" title="George Hurrell">George Hurrell</a> took a series of photographs of Stone, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherilyn_Fenn" title="Sherilyn Fenn">Sherilyn Fenn</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Sands" title="Julian Sands">Julian Sands</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raquel_Welch" title="Raquel Welch">Raquel Welch</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Roberts" title="Eric Roberts">Eric Roberts</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Penn" title="Sean Penn">Sean Penn</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In November 1995, Stone received a star on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, located at 6925 Hollywood Blvd. That same year, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_magazine" title="Empire magazine">Empire</a></i> chose her as one of the 100 sexiest stars in film history. In October 1997, she was ranked among the top 100 movie stars of all time by <i>Empire</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1995, she received a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe Award</a> for Best Actress in a Dramatic Motion Picture for her role as "Ginger" in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_(film)" title="Casino (film)">Casino</a></i> opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a>. She also earned an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for Best Actress for the role.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone starred opposite actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres" title="Ellen DeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a> in the 2000 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO" title="HBO">HBO</a> movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_These_Walls_Could_Talk_2" title="If These Walls Could Talk 2">If These Walls Could Talk 2</a></i>, in which she played a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> trying to start a family.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2001, Stone was linked to a biopic of the German film director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl" title="Leni Riefenstahl">Leni Riefenstahl</a>. The prospective director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Verhoeven" title="Paul Verhoeven">Paul Verhoeven</a> and Riefenstahl herself favoured Stone to portray Riefenstahl in the film. According to Verhoeven, he discussed the project with Stone and she was very interested. Subsequently, Verhoeven pulled out of the project as he wanted to hire a more expensive screenwriter than the producers did.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone was hospitalized in late 2001 for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_hemorrhage" title="Subarachnoid hemorrhage">subarachnoid hemorrhage</a>, which was diagnosed as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_artery_dissection" title="Vertebral artery dissection">vertebral artery dissection</a> rather than the more common ruptured <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm" title="Aneurysm">aneurysm</a>, and treated with an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization" title="Embolization">endovascular coil embolization</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2003, she appeared in three episodes from the eighth season of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice" title="The Practice">The Practice</a></i>. For her performances, she received an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards" title="Emmy Awards">Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone attempted a return to the mainstream with roles in the films <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Creek_Manor" title="Cold Creek Manor">Cold Creek Manor</a></i> (2003) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Stewart" title="Kristen Stewart">Kristen Stewart</a> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman_(film)" title="Catwoman (film)">Catwoman</a></i> (2004) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Berry" title="Halle Berry">Halle Berry</a>; however, both movies were critical and commercial flops.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After years of litigation, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Instinct_2:_Risk_Addiction" title="Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction">Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction</a></i> was released on March 31, 2006. A reason for a long delay in releasing the film was reportedly Stone's dispute with the filmmakers over the nudity in the movie; she wanted more, while they wanted less. A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_sex" title="Group sex">group sex</a> scene was cut in order to achieve an R rating from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPAA" title="MPAA">MPAA</a> for the U.S. release; the controversial scene remained in the U.K. version of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>-based film. Stone told an interviewer, "We are in a time of odd repression and if a popcorn movie allows us to create a platform for discussion, wouldn't that be great?"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite an estimated budget of $70 million, it placed only 10th in gross on its debut weekend with a meager $3,200,000, and was subsequently declared a bomb. It ultimately ran in theaters for only 17 days and finished with a total domestic gross of under $6 million. Despite the failure of <i>Basic Instinct 2</i>, Stone has said that she would love to direct and act in a third <i>Basic Instinct</i> film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She appeared in the 2006 drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Dog" title="Alpha Dog">Alpha Dog</a></i> opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Willis" title="Bruce Willis">Bruce Willis</a>, playing Olivia Mazursky, the mother of a real-life murder victim. Stone wore a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatsuit" title="Fatsuit">fatsuit</a> for the role. In February 2007, Stone found her role as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression" title="Clinical depression">clinically depressed</a> woman in her latest film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_a_Man_Falls_in_the_Forest" title="When a Man Falls in the Forest">When a Man Falls in the Forest</a></i>, uplifting, as it challenged what she called "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prozac" title="Prozac">Prozac</a> society." "It was a watershed experience," she said. "I think that we live in a... Prozac society where we're always told we're supposed to have this kind of equilibrium of emotion. We have all these assignments about how we're supposed to feel about something."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In December 2006, she co hosted the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize_Concert" title="Nobel Peace Prize Concert">Nobel Peace Prize Concert</a> in Oslo, Norway together with Anjelica Huston.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On January 5, 2010, it was announced that Stone would be joining the cast of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit" title="Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></i> for a four-episode arc beginning in April 2010.

Many observers, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>, criticized her actions by claiming that Stone had reacted instinctively to the words of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzanian" title="Tanzanian">Tanzanian</a> President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Mkapa" title="Benjamin Mkapa">Benjamin Mkapa</a>, because she had not done her research on the causes, consequences and methods of preventing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>; if she had done so, she would have found out that most African governments already distribute free bed nets through public hospitals.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the $1 million pledged, only $250,000 was actually raised. In order to fulfill the promise to send $1 million worth of bed nets to Tanzania, UNICEF contributed $750,000. This diverted funds from other UNICEF projects. According to prominent economist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Sala-i-Mart%C3%ADn" title="Xavier Sala-i-MartÃ­n">Xavier Sala-i-MartÃ­n</a>, officials are largely unaware of what happened with the bed nets.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone sparked a storm of criticism for her comments made in an exchange on the red carpet with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_TV_Hong_Kong" title="Cable TV Hong Kong">Cable Entertainment News</a></i> during the 61st Annual <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> on May 25, 2008. When asked about the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Sichuan_earthquake" title="2008 Sichuan earthquake">2008 Sichuan earthquake</a> she remarked:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observers have also noted that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchuan_County" title="Wenchuan County">Wenchuan County</a>, the epicenter of the earthquake, is located in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngawa_Tibetan_and_Qiang_Autonomous_Prefecture" title="Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture">Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture</a>, where ethnic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people" title="Tibetan people">Tibetans</a> comprise over half of the population. According to the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Reporter" title="Hollywood Reporter">Hollywood Reporter</a></i>, after her comments, one of China's biggest cinema chains released statements stating its company would not show her films in its theaters. The founder of the UME Cineplex chain and the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers, Ng See-Yuen called Stone's comments "inappropriate" and said the UME Cineplex chain would not be releasing her films in the future. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Dior_SA" title="Christian Dior SA">Christian Dior</a> advertisements featuring Stone's image were also dropped from all ads in China amid the public uproar. Stone was also struck from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Shanghai_International_Film_Festival" title="2008 Shanghai International Film Festival">2008 Shanghai International Film Festival</a> guest list, with the event's organizers considering a permanent ban for the actress.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Dior_SA" title="Christian Dior SA">Dior China</a> had originally posted an apology in Stone's name, but Stone later denied making the apology during an interview with the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, saying "I'm not going to apologize. Iâ€™m certainly not going to apologize for something that isnâ€™t real and true â€” not for face creams," although she does admit she had "sounded like an idiot". While Stone cited the Dalai Lama as her "good friend" when she made the remark at the Cannes film festival, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama_XIV" title="Dalai Lama XIV">Dalai Lama</a> has reportedly distanced himself from her remark, stating, "yes, I've met that lady".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For many years Sharon Stone maintained that she had an IQ of 148 and was a member of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensa_International" title="Mensa International">Mensa</a>, but in April 2002, she admitted she was not, and had never been a member of the high-IQ society. Jim Blackmore of Mensa said, "It's delightful to finally see Ms. Stone admit that she's not and never has been a member of our society." However, Stone went on to claim that she "went to a Mensa school." In response to this new claim, Blackmore said that would not have been possible as there had been no Mensa schools since the early 1960s.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On February 14, 1998, Stone married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Bronstein" title="Phil Bronstein">Phil Bronstein</a>, executive editor of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Examiner" title="San Francisco Examiner">San Francisco Examiner</a></i> and later <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i>.

I like masculinity and, in truth, only women do that now".</p>

      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Going back ten years, Sam, then a sports handicapper for the mob, is entrusted by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Outfit" title="Chicago Outfit">Chicago Outfit</a> bosses to run the Tangiers Casino, which is under their control through corrupt representatives of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamsters" title="Teamsters">Teamsters</a>. Sam is at first reluctant to manage the Tangiers due to his criminal record, but is able to do so through lax gaming laws which simply require employees to make an application for a casino license; and can work at the casino while awaiting a license hearing, which often take years due to a large backlog. Sam's expertise enables him to quickly double the casino's profits, which are <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skimming_(fraud)" title="Skimming (fraud)">skimmed</a> by the mafia before the records are reported to income tax agencies. Impressed with Sam's work, the bosses send Sam's friend, enforcer Nicholas "Nicky" Santoro (Pesci), to protect Sam and the whole business. Nicky, however, begins to become more of a liability than an asset, as his brash attitude quickly gets him banned from every casino, and his name is placed in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Book_(gaming)" title="Black Book (gaming)">black book</a>. Nicky then gathers his own crew and begins his own businesses, such as a restaurant and a jewelry store, but also engages in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary" title="Burglary">burglary</a>, which is not sanctioned by the bosses.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sam, meanwhile, meets and falls in love with a hustler, Ginger McKenna (Stone). Despite Ginger's reluctance, they soon conceive a daughter, Amy, and marry. But their relationship slowly begins to fall apart when Ginger is caught by Sam and Nicky aiding her former boyfriend, a con man named Lester Diamond (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Woods" title="James Woods">James Woods</a>). Sam also makes an enemy in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada" title="Clark County, Nevada">Clark County</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner" title="Commissioner">Commissioner</a> Pat Webb (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Q._Jones" title="L. Q. Jones">L. Q. Jones</a>) by firing his brother-in-law Donald Ward (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bob_Briggs" title="Joe Bob Briggs">Joe Bob Briggs</a>) from the casino for his incompetence and resisting pressure from Webb to reinstate him. Webb retaliates by pulling Sam's casino license application from the backlog, forcing Sam to have a license hearing, but secretly arranges for the gaming board and State Senator Harrison Roberts of the State of Nevada (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Smothers" title="Dick Smothers">Dick Smothers</a>) to reject the license. Sam responds by appearing on television and openly accuses the city government of corruption. The bosses, unappreciative of Sam's publicity, ask him to return home, but he stubbornly blames Nicky's reckless lawbreaking for his mess. Nicky chastises Sam to never "go over his head" in a heated argument in the desert.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bosses soon notice that the suitcases of money from the skim have decreasing amounts of money, meaning that the money counters have begun skimming some for themselves. They put Artie Piscano in charge of overseeing the skims, but he complains about the expensive costs. Despite the bosses warning Piscano not to keep financial records, he secretly starts writing down how much he spends in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger" title="Ledger">ledger</a>. Piscano's rants about the extra work and the costs are overheard by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a>, who bugged his grocery store. Sam finally reaches the end of his patience with Ginger after she and Lester are in Los Angeles with plans to run away to Europe with his daughter Amy. Sam talks Ginger into bringing Amy back, but her addictions anger Sam so much that he kicks her out of the house. She returns, on the condition that she carry a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pager" title="Pager">beeper</a> on her for Sam to contact her whenever he must. Ginger turns to Nicky for help in getting her share of her and Sam's money from the bank, and they begin a sexual affair, which according to mob rules, could get the three of them killed (as well as Nicky's crew for covering it up). Sam reaches his limit with Ginger when she ties Amy to her bedposts to have a night with Nicky. Sam confronts Ginger in the restaurant and disowns her. She turns to Nicky, but he has lost patience with her as well. The next morning, Ginger goes to Sam's house, creates a domestic disturbance, and takes the key to their bank deposit box. She takes some of the savings, but is then arrested by FBI agents.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Returning to the film's opening scene, Sam survives the car bomb, but knows that the bosses were not responsible for it. With the mob now out of power, the old casinos are purchased by big corporations and demolished to make way for much gaudier gambling attractions financed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-yield_debt" title="High-yield debt">high-yield debt</a>. Sam laments that this new "family friendly" Las Vegas lacks the same kind of catering to the players than the older and to his perception classier Vegas he saw when he ran the Tangiers. In the final scene, an older Sam is shown living once again as a sports handicapper for the mob, or in his words, "<i>right back where [I] started</i>".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The research for <i>Casino</i> began when screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi read a report from the <i>Las Vegas Sun</i> in 1980 about a domestic argument between Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal, a casino figure and his wife, Geri McGee, a former topless dancer. This gave him an idea to focus on a new book about the true story of mob infringement in Las Vegas during the 1970s, when filming of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodfellas" title="Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></i> (the screenplay which he co-wrote with Scorsese) was coming to an end. Pileggi decided to contact Scorsese about taking the helm of the project which would become known as <i>Casino</i>. Scorsese expressed interest in the project calling this an "idea of success, no limits". Although Pileggi was keen to release the book and then concentrate on a film adaptation, Scorsese encouraged him to "reverse the order".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese and Pileggi collaborated on the script lasting for a total of five months, towards the end of 1994. Real-life characters such as Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal, Geri, Anthony Spilotro and his brother were reshaped. Some characters were combined as well as parts of the story being set in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas</a> instead of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. A problem emerged when they were forced to refer Chicago as "back home" and use the words "adapted from a true story" instead of "based on a true story". They also decided to simplify the script, so that the character of Sam "Ace" Rothstein only worked at the Tangiers Casino to show a glimpse of the trials involved in operating a mafia run casino hotel without overwhelming the audience. According to Scorsese, the initial opening sequence was to feature the main character, Sam Rothstein, fighting with his estranged wife, Ginger, on the lawn on their house. Since the scene was too detailed, they changed the sequence to show the explosion of Sam's car and see him fly into the air before hovering over the flames in slow motionâ€”like a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a> about to go straight down in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell" title="Hell">hell</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming took place at night in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera_(hotel_and_casino)" title="Riviera (hotel and casino)">Riviera</a> casino in Las Vegas to replicate the fictional Tangiers. According to the producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_De_Fina" title="Barbara De Fina">Barbara De Fina</a>, there was no point in building a set if the cost was the same to use a real-life one. The opening scene, with Sam's car exploding, was shot three times with the third used for the film. According to Scorsese, "we (with Nicholas Pileggi) wanted to show the end of the old way".</p>
