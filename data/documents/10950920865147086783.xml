      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Newlywed Kate Judson Lawrence (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Brewster" title="Diane Brewster">Diane Brewster</a>) is distraught to discover that her upper class <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Main_Line" title="Philadelphia Main Line">Philadelphia Main Line</a> husband, William Lawrence III (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_West" title="Adam West">Adam West</a>), is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impotence" title="Impotence">impotent</a>. When he leaves her on their wedding night, she seeks comfort from longtime working class friend Mike Flanagan (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Keith" title="Brian Keith">Brian Keith</a>). The next day, Kate learns that she is a widow. She gives birth to a son, Anthony "Tony" Lawrence, and raises him in genteel poverty.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Years pass. Tony (Paul Newman) is an ambitious, smart college student, working his way through school as a construction worker with his sights on becoming a lawyer. One day, he encounters socialite Joan Dickinson (Barbara Rush) when she has a minor car accident. They soon fall in love, though Joan is expected by nearly everyone in her lofty social circle to marry millionaire Carter Henry (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Eisley" title="Anthony Eisley">Anthony Eisley</a>). Their mutual friend, Chester "Chet" Gwynn (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Vaughn" title="Robert Vaughn">Robert Vaughn</a>) warns her not to let social pressure separate her from the one she loves, as it did him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Tony asks her to elope with him, she agrees. However, Joan's father Gilbert Dickinson (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams_(actor)" title="John Williams (actor)">John Williams</a>) persuades Tony to postpone the wedding until next June by offering him invaluable career help and a job at the highly esteemed law firm of which he is a full partner. Believing Tony has allowed himself to be bought, a disillusioned Joan sails to Europe. When Carter follows her, she marries him. Tony is stunned. He channels his energy into his work.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fellow student Louis Donetti (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Picerni" title="Paul Picerni">Paul Picerni</a>) tells Tony about a wonderful opportunity he has to assist John Marshall Wharton (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Kruger" title="Otto Kruger">Otto Kruger</a>) in writing a law book. Tony becomes acquainted with Wharton's much younger wife Carol (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Smith" title="Alexis Smith">Alexis Smith</a>) and steal the job from his classmate. Living and working at Wharton's mansion, Tony impresses his employer with his expertise, but Carol becomes attracted to him. She comes to his bedroom one night, but he cunningly defuses the dangerous situation. He asks her to divorce her husband and marry him, but she is unwilling to start over. Wharton offers Tony a job at his even more prestigious firm. Tony accepts, and decides to specialize in the relatively new area of tax law, where there is more opportunity for rapid advancement.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">Korean War</a> breaks out. Tony survives the conflict without injury, but others are not as fortunate. Chet loses his arm, and Carter is killed.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Tony returns to work, he gets a lucky break. Forced to work over the Christmas holiday, he is available when the very rich Mrs. J. Arthur Allen (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Burke" title="Billie Burke">Billie Burke</a>) needs her will amended. With his specialized knowledge, he shows her how to avoid paying a great deal of taxes, and steals her away from her longtime lawyer, Gilbert Dickinson. He also begins mending his relationship with Joan. Success after success follows, and Tony becomes well known and respected by the Philadelphia elite.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One night, Chet resurfaces. Tony is called to the police station to pick up his disheveled, drunken friend. However, before they can leave, Donetti (now a public prosecutor) has Chet taken into custody and charged with the first degree murder of Morton Stearnes (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Douglas_(actor)" title="Robert Douglas (actor)">Robert Douglas</a>), Chet's uncle and tight-fisted guardian of his inheritance. Chet insists on Tony defending him, fearing that his relatives, particularly family patriarch Dr. Shippen Stearnes (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Conroy_(actor)" title="Frank Conroy (actor)">Frank Conroy</a>), are more interested in avoiding a scandal than proving his innocence. Despite having no experience with criminal law, Tony reluctantly agrees. His work is further complicated when Shippen Stearnes threatens to reveal that Tony's real father is Mike Flanagan if Tony embarrasses the Stearnes clan. When Joan offers to hire a reliable attorney, Tony realizes that she still does not trust him and fears that he has sold out once again. He breaks up with her.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the trial, Tony discredits the testimony of Morton Stearnes' butler, George Archibald (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Deacon_(actor)" title="Richard Deacon (actor)">Richard Deacon</a>). He also gets Shippen to admit that Morton had a brain tumor and was mentally depressed, and that he might have committed suicide. The jury acquits Chet. Tony and Joan reconcile.</p>
