      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Guinness was born at 155 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauderdale_Mansions_South" title="Lauderdale Mansions South">Lauderdale Mansions South</a>, Lauderdale Road, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maida_Vale" title="Maida Vale">Maida Vale</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> as <b>Alec Guinness de Cuffe</b>. His mother's maiden name was Agnes Cuff. She was born 8 December 1890 to Edward Cuff and Mary Ann nÃ©e Benfield. On Guinness's birth certificate, the field for mother's name displays <i>Agnes de Cuffe</i>. In the field for the infant's name (where first names only are usually given), it says <i>Alec Guinness</i>. There is nothing written in the column for name and surname of father. On this basis, it has been frequently speculated that the actor's father was a member of the Irish Guinness family. However, it was a Scottish banker named Andrew Geddes who paid for Guinness's private school education. From 1875, English law required both the presence and consent of the father when the birth of an illegitimate child was registered in order for his name to be put on the certificate. Guinness and Geddes never met, and the identity of Guinness's father has never been confirmed. Guinness was uninterested in his mother, who later had a short marriage to a violent, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell-shock" title="Shell-shock">shell-shocked</a> veteran of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_War" title="Anglo-Irish War">Anglo-Irish War</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In films, Guinness was initially associated mainly with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ealing_comedies" title="Ealing comedies">Ealing comedies</a>, and particularly for playing eight different characters in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_Hearts_and_Coronets" title="Kind Hearts and Coronets">Kind Hearts and Coronets</a></i>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He won particular acclaim for his work with director David Lean. After appearing in Lean's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations_(1946_film)" title="Great Expectations (1946 film)">Great Expectations</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Twist_(1948_film)" title="Oliver Twist (1948 film)">Oliver Twist</a></i>, he was given a starring role opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Holden" title="William Holden">William Holden</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_on_the_River_Kwai" title="The Bridge on the River Kwai">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a></i>. For his performance as Colonel Nicholson, the unyielding British <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POW" title="POW">POW</a> leader, Guinness won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>. Despite a difficult and often hostile relationship, Lean, referring to Guinness as "my good luck charm", continued to cast Guinness in character roles in his later films: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab" title="Arab">Arab</a> leader <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir_Feisal_I" title="Emir Feisal I">Prince Feisal</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_of_Arabia_(film)" title="Lawrence of Arabia (film)">Lawrence of Arabia</a></i>; the title character's half-brother, Bolshevik leader Yevgraf, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Zhivago_(film)" title="Doctor Zhivago (film)">Doctor Zhivago</a></i>; and Indian mystic Godbole in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Passage_to_India_(film)" title="A Passage to India (film)">A Passage to India</a></i>. He was also offered a role in Lean's adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan%27s_Daughter" title="Ryan's Daughter">Ryan's Daughter</a></i> (1970), but declined.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other notable film roles of this period included <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swan_(film)" title="The Swan (film)">The Swan</a></i> (1956) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Kelly" title="Grace Kelly">Grace Kelly</a>, in her second to last film role; <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse%27s_Mouth" title="The Horse's Mouth">The Horse's Mouth</a></i> (1958) in which Guinness played the part of drunken painter Gulley Jimson as well as contributing the screenplay, for which he was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>; <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire_(film)" title="The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)">The Fall of the Roman Empire</a></i> (1964); <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quiller_Memorandum" title="The Quiller Memorandum">The Quiller Memorandum</a></i> (1966); Marley's Ghost in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrooge_(1970_film)" title="Scrooge (1970 film)">Scrooge</a></i> (1970); <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" title="Charles I of England">Charles I of England</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell_(film)" title="Cromwell (film)">Cromwell</a></i> (1970); and the title role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler:_The_Last_Ten_Days" title="Hitler: The Last Ten Days">Hitler: The Last Ten Days</a></i> (1973), which he considered his best film performance, though critics disagreed.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Guinness's role as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi" title="Obi-Wan Kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> in the original <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> trilogy, beginning in 1977, brought him worldwide recognition by a new generation. Guinness agreed to take the part on the condition that he would not have to do any publicity to promote the film. He was also one of the few cast members who believed that the film would be a box office hit; he negotiated a deal for two percent of the gross, which made him very wealthy in his later life. His role would also result in Golden Globe and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nominations.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite these rewards, Guinness soon became unhappy with being identified with the part, and expressed dismay at the fan-following that the <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy attracted. In the DVD commentary of <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>, director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> says that Guinness was not happy with the script re-write in which Obi-Wan is killed. However, Guinness said in a 1999 interview that it was actually his idea to kill off Obi Wan, persuading Lucas that it would make him a stronger character, and that Lucas agreed to the idea. Guinness stated in the interview, "What I didn't tell Lucas was that I just couldn't go on speaking those bloody awful, banal lines. I'd had enough of the mumbo jumbo." He went on to say that he "shriveled up" every time <i>Star Wars</i> was mentioned to him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite Guinness's dislike of the films, Lucas and fellow cast members <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hamill" title="Mark Hamill">Mark Hamill</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Daniels" title="Anthony Daniels">Anthony Daniels</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Fisher" title="Carrie Fisher">Carrie Fisher</a> have spoken highly of his courtesy and professionalism, both on and off the set, in not displaying his distaste for the material to his co-stars. Lucas credited him with inspiring cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to achieving completion of the filming. Guinness was quoted as saying that the royalties he obtained from working on the films gave him "no complaints; let me leave it by saying I can live for the rest of my life in the reasonably modest way I am now used to, that I have no debts and I can afford to refuse work that doesn't appeal to me." In his autobiography, <i>Blessings In Disguise</i>, Guinness tells an imaginary interviewer "Blessed be <i>Star Wars</i>!".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the final volume of the book <i>A Positively Final Appearance</i> (1997), Guinness recounts grudgingly giving an autograph to a young fan who claimed to have watched <i>Star Wars</i> over 100 times, on the condition that the boy promise to stop watching the film, because, as Guinness told him, "this is going to be an ill effect on your life." The fan was stunned at first, but later thanked him (though some sources say it went differently). Guinness grew so tired of modern audiences apparently knowing him only for his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi that he would throw away the mail he received from <i>Star Wars</i> fans without reading it.</p>

He has developed a reputation for fussing over details and panicking about suspect cars following the bullion van. He appears to be a man dedicated to his job and security.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The one thing that has prevented this plan from being put into operation is that selling the gold on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market" title="Black market">black market</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a> would be too risky and Holland is at a loss as to how to smuggle it abroad.</p>

Noticing how similar the foundry is to the place where the gold is made into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingot" title="Ingot">ingots</a>, Holland decides that the ideal way of smuggling the gold out of the country would be as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperweight" title="Paperweight">paperweights</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, and puts this hypothetically to his new friend: "By Jove, Holland, it's a good job we're both honest men", "It is indeed, Pendlebury."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If just one of those towers is found to be gold then the game is up. Pendlebury and Holland therefore track down the schoolgirls and, in exchange for a similar tower and some money (10/- ten <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling" title="Shilling">shillings</a>), recover most of the loot. One girl however refuses to return hers since she intends to give it to a friend who is a policeman.</p>
