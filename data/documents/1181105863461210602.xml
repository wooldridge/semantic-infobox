In films she continued to play women with lusty appetites as in Lindsay Anderson's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Lucky_Man!" title="O Lucky Man!">O Lucky Man!</a></i> (1973), although the haunting Australian-made <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picnic_at_Hanging_Rock_(film)" title="Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)">Picnic at Hanging Rock</a></i> (1975, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Weir" title="Peter Weir">Peter Weir</a>) provided her with a different kind of role, as the authoritarian head teacher of a Victorian girl's school.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She appeared in supporting roles in several American films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_Play" title="Foul Play">Foul Play</a></i> (1978) after relocating to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in the early 1970s, her final British film being <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanks" title="Yanks">Yanks</a></i> (1979, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Schlesinger" title="John Schlesinger">John Schlesinger</a>), for which she received a Supporting Actress BAFTA.</p>

Devastated over their divorce, she moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> in 1975 and tried to forget the relationship. In 1980 a final, futile attempt to win Harrison back proved unsuccessful. Impulsive and insecure, she committed suicide by taking an overdose of barbiturates and alcohol on November 26, 1980 at her home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was reported that her suicide was a result of swallowing lye, alkali, or another unidentified caustic substance on top of the barbiturates which were ingested as detailed in her posthumously published journals. The acidic effect of the poisonous agent was an immediate cause of death which propelled her body smashing through a decorative glass screen divide between two rooms. She was found by her gardener, her body cut to ribbons in a negligee on her kitchen floor amongst the shards of glass on November 26, 1980. The coroner reported the cause of death as "swallowing a caustic substance" and later, "acute <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate" title="Barbiturate">barbiturate</a> intoxication".

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filmed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefield" title="Wakefield">Wakefield</a>, the film concerns a bitter young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> coal miner, Frank Machin (Harris). Following a nightclub altercation in which he takes on the captain of the local rugby league club and smacks a couple of the others, he is recruited by the team's manager, who sees profit in his aggressive streak.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although somewhat initially uncoordinated at league, he impresses the team's owner, Gerald Weaver (Badel), with his spirit and brutality of his playing style during the trial. He is signed up to the top team as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league_positions#Loose_forward_.2F_Lock_forward" title="Rugby league positions">loose forward (number 13)</a> and impresses all with his aggressive forward play. He often punches or elbows the opposition players throughout the game.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Off the field, Frank is much less successful. His recently widowed landlady, Mrs Margaret Hammond (Roberts), a mother of two young children, lost her husband in an accident at Weaver's engineering firm, but gained no compensation because it was ruled to have been a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. He uses her for sex, but in her grief she cannot return any affection; she finds his lack of social graces, for instance, at a smart restaurant, somewhat off-putting, and he is violent towards her. He leaves after a row over her late husband, Weaver and his predatory wife. He rejects the latter's advances and treats her as a commodity, to be used and discarded. Intending a reconciliation, he finds that Margaret is in hospital. She is unconscious, having suffered a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_haemorrhage" title="Cerebral haemorrhage">brain haemorrhage</a> shortly after their split; she soon dies without regaining consciousness. In the end he is seen as "just a great ape on a football field", vulnerable to the ravages of time and injury.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anderson, who often developed unrequited feelings for unobtainable heterosexual men, wrote in his diary on 23 April, 1962, after the first month or so of production: "the most striking feature of it all, I suppose, has been the splendour and misery of my work and relationship with Richard." He felt that Harris was acting better than ever before in his career, but feared his feelings for Harris, whose combination of physicality, affection and cruelty fascinated him, meant that he lacked detachment he needed as a director. "I ought to be calm and detached with him. Instead I am impulsive, affectionate, infinitely susceptible."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though on first release the film was lauded by critics, it was a commercial disaster with the home audiences and the critics, and prompted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Davis_(film_producer)" title="John Davis (film producer)">John Davis</a>, the head of the Rank Organisation to announce that he was pulling out of British New Wave, "kitchen sink" drama, nor would his company make such a "squalid" film again.
