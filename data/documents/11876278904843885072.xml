He is widely acclaimed as one of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States" title="Cinema of the United States">Hollywood's</a> most influential film directors. One of America's most celebrated filmmakers, he epitomized the group of filmmakers known as Young Turks, which included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman" title="Robert Altman">Robert Altman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin" title="William Friedkin">William Friedkin</a>, who emerged in the early 1970s with unconventional ideas that challenged contemporary filmmaking.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He first came into limelight when he won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Original_Screenplay" title="Academy Award for Original Screenplay">Academy Award</a> for co-writing the script for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_(film)" title="Patton (film)">Patton</a></i> in 1970. His directorial fame escalated with the release of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i> in 1972. The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, garnering universal laurels from critics and public alike. It went on to win three Academy Awards, including his second, which he won for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Adapted_Screenplay" title="Best Adapted Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a>, and it was instrumental in cementing his position as one of the prominent American film directors.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He followed it with an equally successful sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II" title="The Godfather Part II">The Godfather Part II</a></i>, which became the first ever sequel to win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>. The film, if possible, received even higher praises than its predecessor, and fetched him three Academy Awards- for Best Adapted Screenplay, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Best Director</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a>. In the same year was released <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation" title="The Conversation">The Conversation</a></i>, which he directed, produced and wrote. The film went on to win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or" title="Palme d'Or">Palme d'Or</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Cannes_Film_Festival" title="1974 Cannes Film Festival">1974 Cannes Film Festival</a>. His next directorial venture was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now" title="Apocalypse Now">Apocalypse Now</a></i> in 1979, and it was as notorious for its lengthy and troubled production as it was critically acclaimed for its vivid and stark depiction of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. It fetched him his second Palme d'Or at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_Cannes_Film_Festival" title="1979 Cannes Film Festival">1979 Cannes Film Festival</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although some his later ventures in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_in_film" title="1980s in film">1980s</a> and early <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s_in_film" title="1990s in film">1990s</a> were critically lauded, Coppola's later work has not met the same level of critical and commercial success as his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_in_film" title="1970s in film">70s</a> films.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Childhood">Childhood</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coppola was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>, Michigan, to a family of Italian ancestry (his paternal grandparents were immigrants from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernalda" title="Bernalda">Bernalda</a>, Basilicata). He received his middle name in honor of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>, as he was born at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford_Hospital" title="Henry Ford Hospital">Henry Ford Hospital</a>. His parents were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_Coppola" title="Italia Coppola">Italia</a> (nÃ©e Pennino) and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine_Coppola" title="Carmine Coppola">Carmine Coppola</a>, who was the first flautist for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Symphony_Orchestra" title="Detroit Symphony Orchestra">Detroit Symphony Orchestra</a>. He was the second of three children (his older brother was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Coppola" title="August Coppola">August Coppola</a> and younger sister is actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talia_Shire" title="Talia Shire">Talia Shire</a>). Two years later, Carmine became the first flautist for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Symphony_Orchestra" title="NBC Symphony Orchestra">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a> and the family moved to New York City, finding a home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodside,_Queens" title="Woodside, Queens">Woodside, Queens</a>, where Francis spent the remainder of his childhood.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coppola had <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio" title="Polio">polio</a> as a boy, leaving him bedridden for large periods of his childhood, and allowing him to indulge his imagination with homemade puppet theater productions. One day he got hold of a copy of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(play)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (play)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></i> and eagerly read it up. This was instrumental in developing his interest in theater. Eager to be involved in film-craft, he turned out 8mm features edited from home movies with such titles as The Rich Millionaire and The Lost Wallet. As a child he was a mediocre student but was very much interested in technology and engineering; so much, in fact, that his friends nicknamed him â€œScienceâ€&#157;. Initially he trained for a career in music and became so proficient on the tuba that he won a musical scholarship to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Military_Academy" title="New York Military Academy">New York Military Academy</a>. After graduating from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Neck_North_High_School" title="Great Neck North High School">Great Neck North High School</a>, he entered <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstra_University" title="Hofstra University">Hofstra University</a> in 1955 to obtain a major in theater arts. There he won a play-writing scholarship, which furthered his interest in directing theater, though this wasn't approved by his father, who wanted him to study engineering. However, after he chanced to see <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein" title="Sergei Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>â€™s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_(film)" title="October (film)">October</a></i>, which impressed him profoundly, particularly the quality of editing in the movie, Coppola decided that he would not go into theater but would opt for cinema. Among his batch-mates were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lainie_Kazan" title="Lainie Kazan">Lainie Kazan</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caan" title="James Caan">James Caan</a>. He would later cast Caan in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rain_People" title="The Rain People">The Rain People</a></i> and in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Corleone" title="Sonny Corleone">Sonny Corleone</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While pursuing his bachelor's degree, Coppola was elected president of The Green Wig, the university's drama group, the Kaleidoscopians, its musical comedy club, and then merged the two into The Spectrum Players. Under his leadership, they staged a new production each week. Coppola also founded the cinema workshop at Hofstra, and contributed prolifically to the campus literary magazine. He won three D. H. Lawrence Awards for theatrical production and direction, and received a Beckerman Award for his outstanding contributions to the school's theater arts division. While a graduate student, one of his teachers happened to be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Arzner" title="Dorothy Arzner">Dorothy Arzner</a>, whose encouragement Coppola later acknowledged was pivotal in his film career. He graduated from the University in 1959.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After obtaining his bachelor's degree from Hofstra, Coppola enrolled in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California" title="University of California">University of California</a> at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. There he chanced to befriend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Morrison" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrison</a>. Coppola would later use his well-known number <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_(The_Doors_song)" title="The End (The Doors song)">The End</a></i> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now" title="Apocalypse Now">Apocalypse Now</a></i>. Very soon he enrolled in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_School_of_Theater,_Film_and_Television" title="UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television">UCLA Film School</a> for graduate work in film. At UCLA, Coppola directed a short horror film called â€œThe Two Christophersâ€&#157; inspired by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe's</a> "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilson_(short_story)" title="William Wilson (short story)">William Wilson</a>". He also directed â€œAyamonn the Terribleâ€&#157;, a film about a sculptorâ€™s nightmares coming to life. It was then he decided to experiment as a serious film director and ended up directing a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softcore_pornography" title="Softcore pornography">softcore</a> porn film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonight_for_Sure" title="Tonight for Sure">Tonight for Sure</a></i> in 1962. The film failed to attract any attention. The company that hired Coppola to edit <i>Tonight for Sure</i> brought him back to re-cut a German film titled <i>Mit Eva fing die SÃ¼nde an</i>. He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writerâ€™s and directorâ€™s credit for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bellboy_and_the_Playgirls" title="The Bellboy and the Playgirls">The Bellboy and the Playgirls</a></i>. It was co-directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Umgelter" title="Fritz Umgelter">Fritz Umgelter</a>. This, too, failed at the box-office, and Coppola decided to act as an assistant under the tutelage of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman" title="Roger Corman">Roger Corman</a>. His first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film Nebo zovyot, which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Beyond_the_Sun" title="Battle Beyond the Sun">Battle Beyond the Sun</a></i>, released in 1962. Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman decided to vest him with more opportunities, and so he made him the dialogue director on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London_(1962_film)" title="Tower of London (1962 film)">Tower of London</a></i> (1962), sound man for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Racers" title="The Young Racers">The Young Racers</a></i> (1963) and associate producer of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terror_(1963_film)" title="The Terror (1963 film)">The Terror</a></i> (1963).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While on location in Ireland for <i>The Young Racers</i> in 1963, Corman, ever alert to an opportunity of producing a decent movie on a shoestring budget, persuaded Coppola to make a low-budget horror movie with funds left over from that movie. Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night. It incorporated elements from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Hitchcock's</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(film)" title="Psycho (film)">Psycho</a></i>, and it impressed Corman enough to give him the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights), Coppola directed in a period of just nine days, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia_13" title="Dementia 13">Dementia 13</a></i>, his first feature from his own original screenplay. Somewhat superior to the run-of-the-mill exploitation films being turned out at that time, the film recouped its shoestring expenses and went on to become a minor cult film among horror buffs. It was on the sets of <i>Dementia 13</i> that he met his future wife <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Coppola" title="Eleanor Coppola">Eleanor Jessie Neil</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (Pilma, Pilma) written by a UCLA student. This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Arts_Productions" title="Seven Arts Productions">Seven Arts</a>. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Property_Is_Condemned" title="This Property Is Condemned">This Property Is Condemned</a></i> (1966) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_Paris_Burning%3F" title="Is Paris Burning?">Is Paris Burning?</a></i> (1966). However fame was still eluding him, and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benedictus" title="David Benedictus">David Benedictus</a> novel <i>You're a Big Boy Now</i> and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_a_Big_Boy_Now" title="You're a Big Boy Now">You're a Big Boy Now</a></i> (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>. This movie brought him some critical acclaim and eventually the Master of Fine Arts Degree.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the success of <i>You're a Big Boy Now</i>, Coppola was offered the reins of the movie version of the Broadway musical <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finian%27s_Rainbow_(film)" title="Finian's Rainbow (film)">Finian's Rainbow</a></i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petula_Clark" title="Petula Clark">Petula Clark</a>, in her first American film, and veteran <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Astaire" title="Fred Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>. Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Warner" title="Jack Warner">Jack Warner</a> was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, "hippie" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California" title="Napa County, California">Napa Valley</a> for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, but his work with Clark no doubt contributed to her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_%E2%80%93_Motion_Picture_Drama" title="Golden Globe Award for Best Actress â€“ Motion Picture Drama">Golden Globe</a> Best Actress nomination. The film introduced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> to him, who became his life-long friend as well as production assistant in his next film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rain_People" title="The Rain People">The Rain People</a></i> in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he fell short of his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie. The film won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shell" title="Golden Shell">Golden Shell</a> at the 1969 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebasti%C3%A1n_International_Film_Festival" title="San SebastiÃ¡n International Film Festival">San Sebastian Film Festival</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio "Zoetrope" after receiving a gift of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoetrope" title="Zoetrope">zoetropes</a> from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture making equipment. While touring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film. He decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in Marin to house the studio. However, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Zoetrope" title="American Zoetrope">Zoetrope Studio</a> became a warehouse in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> on Folsom Street in 1969. The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDTV" title="HDTV">HDTV</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coppola co-wrote the script for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_(film)" title="Patton (film)">Patton</a></i> in 1970 along with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_H._North" title="Edmund H. North">Edmund H. North</a>. This earned him his first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Writing_(Original_Screenplay)" title="Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)">Best Original Screenplay</a>. However, it wasn't easy for Coppola to convince <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_J._Schaffner" title="Franklin J. Schaffner">Franklin J. Schaffner</a> that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_(film)#The_opening" title="Patton (film)">the opening scene</a> would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even after the director was persuaded to keep the scene intact, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Scott" title="George C. Scott">George C. Scott</a> refused to do it, as he believed that the starting scene itself would overshadow the rest of his performance. The director lied and assured him that it would be shown at the end.

The near 3-hour long epic, which chronicled the saga of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corleone_family" title="Corleone family">Corleone family</a>, received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, and fetched Coppola the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Writing_(Original_Screenplay)" title="Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)">Best Original Screenplay</a>, which he shared with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Puzo" title="Mario Puzo">Mario Puzo</a>, and two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe Awards</a>- for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Golden Globe Award for Best Director">Best Director</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Screenplay" title="Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay">Best Screenplay</a>. However, Coppola had to face a lot of difficulties while filming <i>The Godfather</i>. Firstly he was not <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount's</a> first choice to direct the movie. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italian</a> director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Leone" title="Sergio Leone">Sergio Leone</a> was offered the job first, but he declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_the_West" title="Once Upon a Time in the West">Once Upon a Time in the West</a></i>, an italian spaghetti western. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> was then approached but he also declined the offer and made <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Up,_Doc%3F_(film)" title="What's Up, Doc? (film)">What's Up, Doc?</a></i> instead. According to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Evans_(film_producer)" title="Robert Evans (film producer)">Robert Evans</a>, head of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence, and thus reflect poorly on his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian-American" title="Sicilian-American">Sicilian</a> and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office, and he wanted to, in his own words, "smell the spaghetti". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was intense clash between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting also. Coppola stuck to his plan of casting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Corleone" title="Vito Corleone">Vito Corleone</a>, though Paramount wanted it to be either <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Borgnine" title="Ernest Borgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a> or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Thomas" title="Danny Thomas">Danny Thomas</a>. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that "Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test, and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets). Coppola chose Brando over <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Borgnine" title="Ernest Borgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a> on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After it was released, the film compelled overflowing laurels from all corners.

Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> believed that <i>The Godfather</i> was possibly the greatest movie ever made, and had without question the best cast.</p>

The movie was partly influenced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo_Antonioni" title="Michelangelo Antonioni">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>â€™s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowup" title="Blowup">Blowup</a></i> (1966).

Although Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental, for not only was the script for <i>The Conversation</i> completed in the mid-1960s (before the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Presidential_election,_1968" title="United States Presidential election, 1968">election of Richard Nixon</a>) but the spying equipment used in the film was discovered through research and the use of technical advisers and not, as many believed, by revelatory newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fall-out. The movie was a critical success, and won Coppola his first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or" title="Palme d'Or">Palme d'Or</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Cannes_Film_Festival" title="1974 Cannes Film Festival">1974 Cannes Film Festival</a>.</p>

It was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor" title="Technicolor">Technicolor</a>. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour long preview, telling Coppola: "You have two films.

In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use "Part II" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie <i>The Godfather Part II</i>. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen <i>The Godfather</i>, there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. The success of <i>The Godfather Part II</i> began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974, and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim from all corners, with many deeming it even more superior than its predecessor. It was nominated for 11 and received 6 Academy Awards, including 3 for Coppola- Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Best Director</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Godfather Part II</i> is ranked as the #1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's "50 Best Movies of All Time", and is ranked at #7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the "100 Greatest Movies of All Time".

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the late 1980s, Coppola started considering concepts for a motion picture based upon the 19th century novel, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Pinocchio" title="The Adventures of Pinocchio">The Adventures of Pinocchio</a></i>.

These discussions led to negotiations for Coppola to both produce and direct the <i>Pinocchio</i> project for Warner, as well as <i>Secret Garden</i> and <i>Hoover</i>. However, in mid-1991 Coppola and Warner came to disagreement over the compensation to be paid Coppola for his directing services on <i>Pinocchio</i>. The parties deferred this issue, and finally a settlement was reached in 1998, when the jurors awarded Coppola $20 million as compensation for losing the film project, <i>Pinocchio</i>. This was the largest civil verdict ever against a Hollywood studio. The Los Angeles jury awarded him $60 million in punitive damages on top of the $20 million, stemming from his charges that Warner Brothers sabotaged his intended version.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a 10 year hiatus, Coppola returned to film direction with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Without_Youth_(film)" title="Youth Without Youth (film)">Youth Without Youth</a></i> in 2007.

It currently holds a 30% 'rotten' rating on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. It was made for about $19 million, and was given a limited release. As a result, Coppola announced his plans to produce his own films in order to avoid the marketing input that goes into most films (making them appeal to too-wide an audience). The film managed a meagre $244,397 at the box-office.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In late August 1945, as the movie opens, Don Vito Corleone (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>) hears requests for favors during the Don's daughter Connie's wedding reception, while his adopted son <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hagen" title="Tom Hagen">Tom Hagen</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duvall" title="Robert Duvall">Robert Duvall</a>) listens. Singer Johnny Fontane (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Martino" title="Al Martino">Al Martino</a>), Corleone's godson, asks for help in landing a movie role that will revitalize his flagging career. Hagen is dispatched to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> to meet with studio head Jack Woltz (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marley" title="John Marley">John Marley</a>) to ensure Fontane gets his desired role. After initially refusing to cast Fontane, Woltz caves in when he finds the severed head of his prized racehorse "Khartoum" in his bed the next morning.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon Hagen's return, the family leadership meets with "The Turk" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Sollozzo" title="Virgil Sollozzo">Virgil Sollozzo</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Lettieri" title="Al Lettieri">Al Lettieri</a>), who asks Don Corleone to protect the rival Tattaglia family's planned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin" title="Heroin">heroin</a> business. Don Vito disapproves of drug trafficking and feels his political influence could be jeopardized, so he rejects the potentially lucrative proposal. He then sends his primary enforcer, Luca Brasi (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Montana" title="Lenny Montana">Lenny Montana</a>), to find out more about Sollozzo's organization, but Brasi is stabbed in the hand by Sollozzo and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrote" title="Garrote">garroted</a> to death.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Don Corleone is shot five times in the back at a fruit stand in an assassination attempt. Sollozzo abducts Hagen and persuades him to offer Corleone's eldest son, Sonny (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caan_(actor)" title="James Caan (actor)">James Caan</a>), the deal previously offered to the Don. The youngest son, Michael (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>), whom the other <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia" title="American Mafia">Mafia</a> families consider a "civilian" uninvolved in mob business, averts a second murder attempt at the hospital where his father is being treated, but his jaw is broken by corrupt <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_American" title="Irish American">Irish American</a> police Captain McCluskey (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Hayden" title="Sterling Hayden">Sterling Hayden</a>). Sonny retaliates by having Don Philip Tattaglia's son, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Tattaglia" title="Bruno Tattaglia">Bruno</a>, killed.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sollozzo and McCluskey meet with Michael at a local <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Italy" title="Cuisine of Italy">Italian</a> restaurant in an attempt to settle the dispute. Michael pretends he needs to use the bathroom, and following a plan he initiated, retrieves a gun hidden there. Michael returns to the table and kills both Sollozzo and McCluskey. He leaves the country and takes refuge in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>, where he soon marries a young local woman named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonia_Vitelli-Corleone" title="Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone">Apollonia Vitelli</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonetta_Stefanelli" title="Simonetta Stefanelli">Simonetta Stefanelli</a>).

Open warfare soon erupts between the Corleones and the other members of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Families_(The_Godfather)" title="Five Families (The Godfather)">Five Families</a>, while the police and other authorities begin to clamp down on Mafia activity. Don Vito is particularly distressed when he learns of Michael's involvement, since he had planned for Michael to remain uninvolved in the "family business."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sonny impulsively leaves the guarded family compound to confront Carlo (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Russo" title="Gianni Russo">Gianni Russo</a>) who has been abusing Connie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talia_Shire" title="Talia Shire">Talia Shire</a>). Sonny beats Carlo on the street and threatens to kill him if he ever touches Connie again. Later, Carlo beats Connie again, and upon getting her phone call, Sonny leaves the compound again. En route, he is ambushed and killed at a toll booth. Meanwhile, Michael narrowly escapes death in Sicily when his wife is killed by a car bomb.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Don Vito meets with the other Five Family dons and settles their dispute, withdrawing his opposition to the Tattaglia's heroin business. He deduces from the negotiations that the Tattaglias were acting on behalf of the more powerful Don Barzini (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Conte" title="Richard Conte">Richard Conte</a>). With his safety now guaranteed, Michael returns home. More than a year later, he marries his long time American girlfriend, Kay Adams (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a>). As his father withdraws from active control of the Corleone family, and as middle brother Fredo is seen as incapable of shouldering the Don's responsibilities, Michael takes control of the family and its business.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Francis Ford Coppola was not the first choice to direct. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italian</a> director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Leone" title="Sergio Leone">Sergio Leone</a> was offered the job first, but he declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_America" title="Once Upon a Time in America">Once Upon a Time in America</a></i>, which focused on Jewish-American gangsters. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> was then approached but he also declined the offer and made <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Up,_Doc%3F_(film)" title="What's Up, Doc? (film)">What's Up, Doc?</a></i> instead. According to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Evans_(film_producer)" title="Robert Evans (film producer)">Robert Evans</a>, head of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence, and thus reflect poorly on his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian-American" title="Sicilian-American">Sicilian</a> and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office, and he wanted to, in his own words, "smell the spaghetti". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm. At the time, Coppola had directed eight previous films, the most notable of which was the film version of the stage musical <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finian%27s_Rainbow_(film)" title="Finian's Rainbow (film)">Finian's Rainbow</a></i>â€“although he had also received an Academy Award for co-writing <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_(film)" title="Patton (film)">Patton</a></i> in 1970. Coppola was in debt to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> for $400,000 following budget overruns on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138" title="THX 1138">THX 1138</a></i>, which Coppola had produced, and he took <i>The Godfather</i> on Lucas's advice.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was intense friction between Coppola and Paramount, and several times Coppola was almost replaced. Paramount maintains that its skepticism was due to a rocky start to production, though Coppola believes that the first week went extremely well. The studio thought that Coppola failed to stay on schedule, frequently made production and casting errors, and insisted on unnecessary expenses, and two top producers unsuccessfully tried to convince another filmmaker to take Coppola's place. The producers scapegoated the other filmmaker when their attempt to fire Coppola became known. Because the producers told him that the other filmmaker had attempted a coup, Coppola says he was shadowed by a replacement director, who was ready to take over if Coppola was fired, but despite such intense pressure, he managed to defend his decisions and avoid being replaced.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Paramount was in financial trouble at the time of production and was desperate for a "big hit" to boost business, hence the pressure Coppola faced during filming. They wanted <i>The Godfather</i> to appeal to a wide audience and threatened Coppola with a "violence coach" to make the film more exciting. Coppola added a few more violent scenes to keep the studio happy. The scene in which Connie breaks dishes after finding out that her husband is cheating was added for this reason.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coppola's casting choices were unpopular with studio executives at Paramount Pictures, particularly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a> as Don Vito Corleone. Coppola's first two choices for the role were both Brando and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, but Olivier's agent refused the role saying "Lord Olivier is not taking any jobs. He's very sick. He's gonna die soon and he's not interested" (Olivier lived 18 years after the refusal). Paramount, which wanted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Borgnine" title="Ernest Borgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a>, originally refused to allow Coppola to cast Brando in the role, citing difficulties Brando had on recent film sets. One studio executive proposed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Thomas" title="Danny Thomas">Danny Thomas</a> for the role citing the fact that Don Corleone was a strong "family man." At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that "Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test, and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets). Coppola chose Brando over Borgnine on the basis of his screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> for his portrayal, which he refused to accept.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studio originally wanted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a> or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_O%27Neal" title="Ryan O'Neal">Ryan O'Neal</a> to play <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Corleone" title="Michael Corleone">Michael Corleone</a>, but Coppola wanted an unknown who looked like an Italian-American, whom he found in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>. Pacino was not well known at the time, having appeared in only two minor films, and the studio did not consider him right for the part, in part because of his height. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sheen" title="Martin Sheen">Martin Sheen</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caan_(actor)" title="James Caan (actor)">James Caan</a> also auditioned. At one point, Caan was the first choice to play Michael, while <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine_Caridi" title="Carmine Caridi">Carmine Caridi</a> was signed as elder brother Sonny. Pacino was given the role only after Coppola threatened to quit the production; Caan stated that Coppola envisioned Michael to be the Sicilian-looking one and Sonny was the Americanized version. The studio agreed to Pacino on the condition that Caan was cast as Sonny instead of Caridi, despite the former's Jewish heritage and the latter closely matching the character in the novel (a six-foot-four, black-haired Italian-American bull). Coppola and Puzo would subsequently create a role for Caridi in the sequels.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dern" title="Bruce Dern">Bruce Dern</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McQueen" title="Steve McQueen">Steve McQueen</a> were considered for the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hagen" title="Tom Hagen">Tom Hagen</a> that eventually went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duvall" title="Robert Duvall">Robert Duvall</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone" title="Sylvester Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> auditioned for Carlo Rizzi and Paulie Gatto, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Perkins" title="Anthony Perkins">Anthony Perkins</a> for Sonny, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Farrow" title="Mia Farrow">Mia Farrow</a> auditioned for Kay. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Devane" title="William Devane">William Devane</a> was seen for the role of Moe Greene. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Adorf" title="Mario Adorf">Mario Adorf</a> was approached for a role as well. A then-unknown <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a> auditioned for the roles of Michael, Sonny, Carlo, and Paulie Gatto. He was cast as Paulie, but Coppola arranged a "trade" with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gang_That_Couldn%27t_Shoot_Straight" title="The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight">The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight</a></i> to get Al Pacino from that film. De Niro later played the young Vito Corleone in <i>Part II</i>, winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for the role.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To some extent, the film was a family affair for Francis Ford Coppola. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine_Coppola" title="Carmine Coppola">Carmine Coppola</a>, his father, who had a distinguished career as a composer, conductor and arranger, wrote additional music for the film and appeared in a bit part as a piano player, and Carmine's wife, Italia Coppola, was an extra. The director's sister, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talia_Shire" title="Talia Shire">Talia Shire</a>, was cast as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Corleone" title="Connie Corleone">Connie Corleone</a>, and his infant daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Coppola" title="Sofia Coppola">Sofia</a>, played Connie's and Carlo's newborn son, Michael Francis Rizzi, in the climactic baptism scene near the movie's end. Coppola also cast his sons as Tom Hagen's sons, Frank and Andrew. They are seen in the Sonny-Carlo street fight scene and behind Pacino and Duvall during the funeral scene.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Al Pacino, James Caan and Diane Keaton each received $35,000 for their work on <i>The Godfather</i>, and Robert Duvall got $36,000 for eight weeks of work. Marlon Brando was paid $50,000 for six weeks and weekly expenses of $1,000, plus 5% of the film, capped at $1.5 million. Brando later sold his points back to Paramount for $300,000.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the movie's most shocking moments involved the real severed head of a horse. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a> groups protested the inclusion of the scene. Coppola later stated that the horse's head was delivered to him from a dog food company; a horse had not been killed specifically for the movie. This scene was shot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Washington,_New_York" title="Port Washington, New York">Port Washington, New York</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the novel, Jack Woltz, the movie producer whose horse's head is put in his bed, is also shown to be a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia" title="Pedophilia">pedophile</a> as Tom Hagen sees a young girl (presumably one of Woltz's child stars) crying while walking out of Woltz's room. This scene was cut from the theatrical release but can be found on the DVD (though Woltz can still briefly be seen kissing the girl on the cheek in his studio in the film).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The shooting of Moe Greene through the eye was inspired by the death of gangster <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugsy_Siegel" title="Bugsy Siegel">Bugsy Siegel</a>. To achieve the effect, actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rocco" title="Alex Rocco">Alex Rocco</a>'s glasses had two tubes hidden in their frames. One had fake blood in it, and the other had a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB_gun#Ammunition" title="BB gun">BB</a> and compressed air. When the gun was shot, the compressed air shot the BB through the glasses, shattering them from the inside. The other tube then released the fake blood.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The opening scene of <i>The Godfather</i> is a long, slow zoom, starting with a close-up of the undertaker, Bonasera, who is petitioning Don Corleone, and ending with the Godfather, seen from behind, framing the scene. This zoom, which lasts for about three minutes, was shot with a computer-controlled zoom lens designed by Tony Karp. The lens was also used in the making of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running" title="Silent Running">Silent Running</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Locations around New York City and its environs were used for the film, including the then-closed flagship store of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_%26_Co." title="Best &amp; Co.">Best &amp; Company</a> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Avenue" title="Fifth Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>, which was dressed up and used for the scene in which Pacino and Keaton are Christmas shopping. At least one location in Los Angeles was used also (for the exterior of Woltz's mansion), for which neither <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duvall" title="Robert Duvall">Robert Duvall</a> nor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marley" title="John Marley">John Marley</a> were available; in some shots, it is possible to see that extras are standing in for the two actors.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous gangster movies had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider. In contrast, <i>The Godfather</i> presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society. Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering. The setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping, considered an important part of the film's appeal.

This was even more the case with <i>The Godfather Part II</i>, and the success of those two films, critically, artistically and financially, opened the doors for more and varied depictions of mobster life, including films such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodfellas" title="Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></i> and TV series such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chase" title="David Chase">David Chase</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos" title="The Sopranos">The Sopranos</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The image of the Mafia as being a feudal organization with the Don being both the protector of the small fry and the collector of obligations from them to repay his services, which <i>The Godfather</i> helped to popularize, is now an easily recognizable cultural <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature)" title="Trope (literature)">trope</a>, as is that of the Don's family as a "royal family".

This portrayal stands in contrast to the more sordid reality of lower level Mafia "familial" entanglements, as depicted in various post-<i>Godfather</i> Mafia fare, such as Scorsese's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Streets" title="Mean Streets">Mean Streets</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_(film)" title="Casino (film)">Casino</a></i>, and also to the grittier <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" title="Film noir">hard-boiled</a> pre-<i>Godfather</i> films.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1975, Coppola edited <i>The Godfather</i> and <i>The Godfather Part II</i> together for TV, putting the scenes in chronological order and adding some previously unseen footage, but also toning down the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence" title="Violence">violence</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex" title="Sex">sex</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity" title="Profanity">profanity</a>. It is rated TV-14. This version of the story was called <i>The Godfather Saga</i>. In 1981, Paramount released the <i>Godfather Epic</i> box set which combined parts I &amp; II in chronological order, again with additional scenes not shown in theaters. In 1992, Coppola would again re-edit all three <i>Godfather</i> movies (<i>The Godfather</i>, <i>The Godfather Part II</i> and <i>The Godfather Part III</i>) in chronological order dubbed <i>The Godfather Trilogy 1901-1980</i>. It was released on VHS and laserdisc in 1993 but has yet (as of 2008) to appear on DVD. The total run time for this version is 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes). This version spanned five VHS tapes and incorporated new previously deleted scenes that had not been seen in <i>The Godfather Saga</i>. This set also included a sixth VHS tape: "The Godfather Family: A Look Inside" a making-of documentary.</p>

Fans have longed for a complete release of the entire series though Francis Ford Coppola has stated that the films were meant to be seen in their original form and has not agreed (as of 2008) to a chronological release.</p>

The collection contained all three films with commentary from Francis Ford Coppola and a bonus disc that featured a 73-minute documentary from 1991 titled <i>The Godfather Family: A Look Inside</i>, plus a 1971 documentary. The package also contained deleted footage, including the additional scenes originally contained in <i>The Godfather Saga</i>; "Francis Coppola's Notebook" a look inside a notebook the director kept with him at all times during the production of the film; rehearsal footage; and video segments on Gordon Willis's cinematography, Nino Rota's and Carmine Coppola's music, Francis Ford Coppola, locations and Mario Puzo's screenplays. The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a "Godfather" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Coppola restoration on Blu-ray (2008), the end credit theme music for <i>The Godfather Part II</i> is missing the final chord (approximately 10 seconds) from the film proper. This missing chord would be located immediately before the restoration credit music begins. Robert A. Harris has not publicly commented about this.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Godfather</i>, along with the other films in the trilogy, had a strong impact on the public at large. Don Vito Corleone's line "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse" was voted as the second most memorable line in cinema history in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Movie_Quotes" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes">AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes</a> by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a>. The line actually originates in the French novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_P%C3%A8re_Goriot" title="Le PÃ¨re Goriot">Le PÃ¨re Goriot</a></i>, by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac" title="HonorÃ© de Balzac">HonorÃ© de Balzac</a>, where <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vautrin" title="Vautrin">Vautrin</a> tells <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_de_Rastignac" title="EugÃ¨ne de Rastignac">EugÃ¨ne</a> that he is "making him an offer that he cannot refuse".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An indication of the continuing influence of <i>The Godfather</i> and its sequels can be gleaned from the many references to it which have appeared in every medium of popular culture in the decades since the film's initial release.

In the television show <i>The Sopranos</i>, Tony Soprano's topless bar is named Bada Bing after the line in <i>The Godfather</i> when Sonny says, "You've gotta get up close like this and bada-bing! You blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit."</p>
