	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>William Wyler</b> (July 1, 1902 â€“ July 27, 1981) was a leading <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">American</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film" title="Film">motion picture</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">director</a>, producer, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter" title="Screenwriter">screenwriter</a>. He was regarded as second only to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a> as a "master craftsman of cinema."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Notable works included <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i> (1959), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Years_of_Our_Lives" title="The Best Years of Our Lives">The Best Years of Our Lives</a></i> (1946), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Miniver_(film)" title="Mrs. Miniver (film)">Mrs. Miniver</a></i> (1942), all of which won Wyler Academy Awards for Best Director, and also won Best Picture. He earned his first Oscar nomination for directing <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodsworth_(film)" title="Dodsworth (film)">Dodsworth</a></i> in 1936, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Huston" title="Walter Huston">Walter Huston</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Astor" title="Mary Astor">Mary Astor</a>, "sparking a 20-year run of almost unbroken greatness."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film historian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Freer" title="Ian Freer">Ian Freer</a> calls Wyler a "bona fide perfectionist," whose penchant for retakes and an attempt to hone every last nuance, "became the stuff of legend." His ability to direct a string of classic literary adaptations into huge box-office and critical successes made him one of "Hollywood's most bankable moviemakers" during the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other popular films include <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_Girl_(film)" title="Funny Girl (film)">Funny Girl</a></i> (1968), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Steal_a_Million" title="How to Steal a Million">How to Steal a Million</a></i> (1966), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Country" title="The Big Country">The Big Country</a></i> (1958), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Holiday" title="Roman Holiday">Roman Holiday</a></i> (1953), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heiress" title="The Heiress">The Heiress</a></i> (1949), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Letter_(1940_film)" title="The Letter (1940 film)">The Letter</a></i> (1940), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Westerner_(film)" title="The Westerner (film)">The Westerner</a></i> (1940), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights_(1939_film)" title="Wuthering Heights (1939 film)">Wuthering Heights</a></i> (1939), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezebel_(film)" title="Jezebel (film)">Jezebel</a></i> (1938), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodsworth_(film)" title="Dodsworth (film)">Dodsworth</a></i> (1936), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_House_Divided_(film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="A House Divided (film) (page does not exist)">A House Divided</a></i> (1931), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Heroes_(film)" title="Hell's Heroes (film)">Hell's Heroes</a></i> (1930).</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wyler was born <b>Wilhelm Weiller</b> to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> family, a Swiss father and a German mother, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulhouse" title="Mulhouse">Mulhouse</a> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">French</a> region of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace" title="Alsace">Alsace</a> (then part of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire" title="German Empire">German Empire</a>). His mother was a cousin of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Laemmle" title="Carl Laemmle">Carl Laemmle</a>, founder of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures" title="Universal Pictures">Universal Pictures</a>. His father, Leopold, started as a traveling salesman which he later turned into a thriving haberdashery business.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his childhood Wyler attended a number of schools and developed a reputation as "something of a hellraiser," being expelled more than once for misbehavior. His mother often took him and his older brother Robert, to concerts, opera, and the theatre, as well as the early cinema. Sometimes at home his family and their friends would stage amateur theatricals for personal enjoyment.</p>

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Film_career">Film career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Around 1923, he arrived in Los Angeles and began work on the Universal lot on the swing gang, cleaning the stages and moving the sets. His break came when he was hired as a 2nd assistant editor. His work ethic was uneven at best with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a> nicknaming him "Worthless Willy". After some ups and downs (including getting fired) Wyler became focused on becoming a director. He started as a third assistant director and by 1925 he became the youngest director on the Universal lot directing the Westerns that Universal was famed at turning out. In 1928, he became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalized" title="Naturalized">naturalized</a> citizen of the United States. He directed his first non-Western, the lost <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anybody_Here_Seen_Kelly%3F" title="Anybody Here Seen Kelly?">Anybody Here Seen Kelly?</a></i>, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1928_in_film" title="1928 in film">1928</a>. These were followed by his first part-talkie films, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shakedown_(1929_film)" title="The Shakedown (1929 film)">The Shakedown</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Love_Trap&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Love Trap (page does not exist)">The Love Trap</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He soon proved himself an able craftsman and in the early 1930s became one of Universal's greatest assets, directing such solid films as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Love_Trap&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Love Trap (page does not exist)">The Love Trap</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hell%27s_Heroes_(1930_film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Hell's Heroes (1930 film) (page does not exist)">Hell's Heroes</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tom_Brown_of_Culver&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Tom Brown of Culver (page does not exist)">Tom Brown of Culver</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Fairy_(film)" title="The Good Fairy (film)">The Good Fairy</a></i>. He became well-known for his merciless (some would say sadistic) insistence on multiple retakes, resulting in often award-winning and critically acclaimed performances from his actors. After leaving Universal he began a long collaboration with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn" title="Samuel Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a> for whom he directed such classics as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodsworth" title="Dodsworth">Dodsworth</a></i> (1936), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Three" title="These Three">These Three</a></i> (1936), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_End" title="Dead End">Dead End</a></i> (1937), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights" title="Wuthering Heights">Wuthering Heights</a></i> (1939), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Westerner" title="The Westerner">The Westerner</a></i> (1940), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Foxes" title="The Little Foxes">The Little Foxes</a></i> (1941) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Years_of_Our_Lives" title="The Best Years of Our Lives">The Best Years of Our Lives</a></i> (1946).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, whom Wyler directed to his first-ever Oscar nomination, for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights" title="Wuthering Heights">Wuthering Heights</a></i>, credited Wyler with teaching him how to act for the screen, despite clashing with Wyler on multiple occasions during the making of the film. Olivier would go on to hold the record for the most nominations in the Best Actor category. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Davis" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a> received three Oscar nominations for her screen work under Wyler, and won her second Oscar for her performance in Wyler's 1938 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezebel_(film)" title="Jezebel (film)">Jezebel</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Heston" title="Charlton Heston">Charlton Heston</a> won his only nomination and Best Actor Oscar for his work in Wyler's 1959 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand" title="Barbra Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> co-won 1968's Best Actress Oscar for her screen debut as entertainer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Brice" title="Fanny Brice">Fanny Brice</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_Girl" title="Funny Girl">Funny Girl</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> won an Oscar in her debut performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Holiday" title="Roman Holiday">Roman Holiday</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1941 Wyler directed one of the key films that galvanized support for Britain and against the Nazis in an America slow to awaken to the threat in Europe, it was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Miniver_(film)" title="Mrs. Miniver (film)">Mrs. Miniver</a></i> (1942), a story of a middle class English family adjusting to the war in Europe. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Miniver_(film)" title="Mrs. Miniver (film)">Mrs. Miniver</a></i> won Wyler his first Academy Award for Best Director, as well as another five Oscars.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wyler was such a perfectionist that he earned the nickname 90-take Wyler. On the set of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezebel_(film)" title="Jezebel (film)">Jezebel</a></i> Wyler forced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a> through 40 takes of one particular scene, his only guidance being - â€&#157;Again!â€&#157; - after each take. When Fonda asked for more direction, Wyler responded, â€&#157;It stinksâ€&#157;. Similarly, when Charlton Heston quizzed the director about the supposed shortcomings in his performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i>, Wyler dismissed his concerns with a simple, â€&#157;Be betterâ€&#157;.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="World_War_II">World War II</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 1942 and 1945, Wyler served as a major in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces" title="United States Army Air Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> and directed two documentaries <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Memphis_Belle:_A_Story_of_a_Flying_Fortress" title="The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress">The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress</a></i> (1944) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt!" title="Thunderbolt!">Thunderbolt!</a></i> (1947), with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lester_Koenig&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Lester Koenig (page does not exist)">Lester Koenig</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sturges" title="John Sturges">John Sturges</a>, the story of a P-47 fighter-bomber squadron in the Mediterranean. Wyler filmed <i>The Memphis Belle</i> at great personal risk flying over enemy territory on actual bombing missions in 1943; on one flight, Wyler passed out from lack of oxygen. Wyler's associate, cinematographer Harold J. Tannenbaum was shot down and perished during the filming.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wyler also directed a film which captured the mood of the nation as it turned to peace after the war. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Years_of_Our_Lives" title="The Best Years of Our Lives">The Best Years of Our Lives</a></i> (1946), the story of three veterans arriving home and adjusting to civilian life, dramatized the problems of returning veterans for those who had remained on the homefront. Wyler's most personal film, taken from his experiences away from his family for three years and on the front, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Years_of_Our_Lives" title="The Best Years of Our Lives">The Best Years of Our Lives</a></i> won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Academy Award for Best Director</a> (his second) and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Postwar_career">Postwar career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the immediate postwar period, Wyler directed a handful of critically acclaimed and influential films, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heiress" title="The Heiress">The Heiress</a></i> which earned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland" title="Olivia de Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a> her second Oscar, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Holiday_(1953_film)" title="Roman Holiday (1953 film)">Roman Holiday</a></i> (1953), which introduced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> to American audiences and resulted in her first Oscar nomination and win, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Persuasion_(film)" title="Friendly Persuasion (film)">Friendly Persuasion</a></i> (1956) which was awarded the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or" title="Palme d'Or">Palme d'Or</a> (Golden Palm) at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i> (1959) which won 11 Oscars (equalled only twice, by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a></i> in 1997 and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</a></i> in 2003). Ben-Hur won Wyler his third Academy Award for Best Director.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wyler's films garnered more awards for participating artists and actors than any other director in the history of Hollywood. He received twelve Oscar nominations for Best Director in total, while dozens of his collaborators and actors won Oscars or were nominated. In 1965, Wyler won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a> Award for career achievement. Eleven years later, he received the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> Life Achievement Award. In addition to his Best Picture and Best Director Oscar wins, thirteen of Wyler's films earned Best Picture nominations.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wyler's style is (among <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur_theory" title="Auteur theory">auteurist</a> critics) notoriously difficult to perceive. He did not build a stable of players like most directors, although frequent collaborators included composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Newman" title="Alfred Newman">Alfred Newman</a>, and editors Daniel Madell and Robert Swink. He directed varied types of films without any trademark shots or themes, but in his choice of lighting, blocking and camera distance, and in the serious liberal tone of his work, a continuity of worldview is detectable.</p>

He does not want to return to his old job, but has no choice, given the stiff competition from other returning veterans and his lack of civilian skills. He had met Marie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Mayo" title="Virginia Mayo">Virginia Mayo</a>) while in training and married her shortly afterward, before shipping out less than a month later. She took a job as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_club" title="Night club">night club</a> waitress and set up her own apartment while Fred was overseas.

The relationship between Peggy and Fred begins slowly, but there is a mutual attraction almost from the start. After a double-date with Fred and Marie, Peggy is contemptuous of Marie, believing she is shallow. Peggy tells her parents she intends to break up Fred and Marie's marriage, only to be told that their own marriage overcame similar problems. To protect Peggy, Al pressures Fred to break off all contact with his daughter. Fred does so, but the friendship between the two men is strained almost to the breaking point.</p>

When he returns, both Homer and his parents have trouble dealing with his disability. He does not want to burden Wilma with a handicapped man, so he pushes her away, although she adjusts best to his changed life. His uncle Butch owns a bar where the three men meet from time to time. Butch counsels Homer, but refrains from telling his nephew what to do.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Director William Wyler had flown combat missions over Europe in filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Belle:_A_Story_of_a_Flying_Fortress" title="Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress">Memphis Belle</a></i> (1944) and worked hard to get accurate depictions of the combat veterans he had encountered.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For <i>The Best Years of Our Lives</i>, he asked the principal actors to purchase their own clothes, in order to connect with daily life and produce an authentic feeling. Other Wyler touches included constructing life-size sets, which went against the standard larger sets that were more suited to camera positions. The impact for the audience was immediate, as each scene played out in a realistic, natural way.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie began filming on April 15, 1946 at a variety of locations, including the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Arboretum_and_Botanic_Garden" title="Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden">Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_International_Airport" title="Ontario International Airport">Ontario International Airport</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario,_California" title="Ontario, California">Ontario, California</a>, Raleigh Studios, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> and the Samuel Goldwyn/Warner Hollywood Studios. Many scenes were also filmed in Phoenxiville, PA, most notably the banking scenes using the Farmers and Mechanics Bank located on Main Street and various other scenes showing Bridge Street and Main Street in Phoenixville, PA. <i>The Best Years of Our Lives</i> is notable for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer" title="Cinematographer">cinematographer</a> Gregg Toland's use of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_focus" title="Deep focus">deep focus</a> photography, in which objects both close to and distant from the camera are in sharp <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(optics)" title="Focus (optics)">focus</a>. For the passage of Fred Derry's reliving a combat mission while sitting in the remains of a former bomber, Wyler used "zoom" effects to simulate an aircraft's taking off.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not everyone was as complimentary. The critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Farber" title="Manny Farber">Manny Farber</a> called it "a horse-drawn truckload of liberal schmaltz."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In July 2010, the film has a 97% "Fresh" rating at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, based on 35 reviews. The film enjoys a 100% "Fresh" rating on the site's "Top Critics" section, based on 8 reviews.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was a massive popular success. When box office prices are adjusted for inflation, it remains one of the top 100 grossing films in U.S. history. Among films released before 1950, only <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bells_of_St._Mary%27s" title="The Bells of St. Mary's">The Bells of St. Mary's</a></i> and four Disney titles have done more total business, in part due to later re-releases. (Reliable box office figures for certain early films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_of_a_Nation" title="Birth of a Nation">Birth of a Nation</a></i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>'s comedies are unavailable.) </p>

The film received seven Academy Awards. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_March" title="Fredric March">Fredric March</a> won his second Best Actor award (after winning in 1932 for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Jekyll_and_Mr._Hyde_(1931_film)" title="Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></i>). (Dana Andrews' brilliant performance turned out to be overshadowed by the acclaim Fredric March and Harold Russell received.)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite his Oscar-nominated performance, Harold Russell was not a professional actor. As the Academy Board of Governors considered him a long shot to win, they gave him an honorary award "for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance". When Russell won Best Supporting Actor, there was an enthusiastic response. He is the only actor to have received two Academy Awards for the same performance. He later sold one of the awards for $50,000, first claiming it was to pay his wife's medical bills. Later he said it was to pay for a cruise for her. He often joked, "I can pick up anything but the check!"</p>
