	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first play Minnelli directed was a musical revue titled <i>At Home Abroad</i> which opened in October 1935 and starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Lillie" title="Beatrice Lillie">Beatrice Lillie</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Waters" title="Ethel Waters">Ethel Waters</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Powell" title="Eleanor Powell">Eleanor Powell</a>.

The first movie that he directed, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_in_the_Sky" title="Cabin in the Sky">Cabin in the Sky</a></i> (1943), was visibly influenced by the theater.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Minnelli's critical reputation has known a certain amount of fluctuation, being admired (or dismissed) in America as a "pure stylist" who, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sarris" title="Andrew Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a>' words, "believes more in beauty than in art." His work reached a height of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critics" title="Critics">critical</a> attention during the late 1950s and early 1960s in France with extensive studies in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahiers_du_Cin%C3%A9ma" title="Cahiers du CinÃ©ma">Cahiers du CinÃ©ma</a></i> magazine, especially in the articles by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jean_Douchet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Jean Douchet (page does not exist)">Jean Douchet</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jean_Domarchi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Jean Domarchi (page does not exist)">Jean Domarchi</a>, who saw in him a cinematic visionary obsessed with beauty and harmony, and an artist who could give substance to the world of dreams.

The MGM compilation film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_Entertainment!" title="That's Entertainment!">That's Entertainment!</a></i> showed clips from many of his films.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Set in turn-of-the-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century" title="20th century">20th century</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, the film opens with HonorÃ© Lachaille among high society in the Bois de Boulogne. A charming old <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rou%C3%A9" title="RouÃ©">rouÃ©</a>, he cynically remarks that "Like everywhere else, most people in Paris get married, but not all. There are some who will not marry, and some who do not marry. But in Paris, those who will not marry are usually men, and those who do not marry are usually women." So marriage is not the only option for wealthy young <i>bon vivants</i> like his nephew Gaston, who is bored with life. The one thing Gaston truly enjoys is spending time with Madame Alvarez, whom he calls Mamita, and especially her granddaughter, the precocious, carefree Gilberte, aka Gigi.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the family tradition, Madame Alvarez sends Gigi to Great Aunt Alicia to be groomed as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtesan" title="Courtesan">courtesan</a> and learn etiquette and charm. To Alicia, love is an art, and a necessary accomplishment for Gigi's social and economic future. The young girl initially is a very poor student who fails to understand the reasons behind her education. She enjoys spending time with Gaston, whom she regards as an elder brother.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prepared to accept her fate as Gaston's mistress, Gigi emerges from her room looking like a woman. Gaston is enchanted and takes her to dinner at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim%27s_Paris" title="Maxim's Paris">Maxim's</a>, where she seems perfectly at ease. The stares of other patrons make Gaston extremely uncomfortable as he realizes Gigi's interpretation of things may have been accurate after all, and discovers his love for her makes the idea of her as his mistress an unbearable one. He leaves the party with Gigi in tow and takes her home without explanation. After wandering the streets throughout the night, he returns to Mamita's home and humbly asks for Gigi's hand in marriage.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hollywood producer Arthur Freed first proposed a musicalization of the Colette novella to Alan Jay Lerner during the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> tryout of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Fair_Lady" title="My Fair Lady">My Fair Lady</a></i> in 1954. When Lerner arrived in Hollywood two years later, Freed was battling the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Code" title="Hays Code">Hays Code</a> in order to bring his tale of a courtesan-in-training to the screen. Another roadblock to the project was the fact Colette's widower had sold the rights to her novella to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Miller" title="Gilbert Miller">Gilbert Miller</a>, who planned to produce a film version of the 1954 stage adaptation by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Loos" title="Anita Loos">Anita Loos</a>. It cost Freed more than $87,000 to purchase the rights from Gilbert and Loos.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lerner's songwriting partner Frederick Loewe had expressed no interest in working in Hollywood, so Lerner agreed to write the screenplay only. He and Freed discussed casting; Lerner favored <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>, who had starred in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> production written by Loos, but Freed preferred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Caron" title="Leslie Caron">Leslie Caron</a>, who had co-starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_in_Paris_(film)" title="An American in Paris (film)">An American in Paris</a></i> for him. Both agreed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Chevalier" title="Maurice Chevalier">Maurice Chevalier</a> would be ideal for aging boulevardier HonorÃ© Lachaille, and Lerner proposed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Bogarde" title="Dirk Bogarde">Dirk Bogarde</a> for Gaston. Lerner agreed to write the lyrics if Freed could convince Bogarde and designer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Beaton" title="Cecil Beaton">Cecil Beaton</a> to join the project. He decided to approach Loewe once again, and when he suggested they compose the score in Paris, Loewe agreed.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In March 1957, the duo began working in Paris. When Chevalier, who already had agreed to appear in the film, first heard "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_Heaven_for_Little_Girls" title="Thank Heaven for Little Girls">Thank Heaven for Little Girls</a>," he was delighted. When he discussed his waning interest in wine and women in favor of performing for an audience in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret" title="Cabaret">cabarets</a>, Chevalier inadvertently inspired the creation of another tune for his character, "I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore." The lyrics for another of his songs, the duet "I Remember It Well" performed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Gingold" title="Hermione Gingold">Hermione Gingold</a> as his former love Madame Alvarez, were adapted from words Lerner had written for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Life" title="Love Life">Love Life</a></i>, a 1948 collaboration with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill" title="Kurt Weill">Kurt Weill</a>. "Say a Prayer for Me Tonight," a solo performed by Gigi, had been written for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_Doolittle" title="Eliza Doolittle">Eliza Doolittle</a> in <i>My Fair Lady</i> but was removed during the pre-Broadway run. Lerner disliked the melody, but Loewe, Freed, and Minnelli voted to include it in the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having second thoughts about Audrey Hepburn, Freed asked Lerner to meet with her in Paris, but she declined the role. The producer then asked him to fly to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> to speak to Leslie Caron, who was living there with her husband <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hall_(director)" title="Peter Hall (director)">Peter Hall</a>. Lerner was surprised to discover the star had become <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicisation" title="Anglicisation">Anglicized</a> to the point of losing her French accent. She had recently starred in an unsuccessful stage production of <i>Gigi</i>, but when she heard Lerner's interpretation of the story greatly differed from that of the play, she accepted his offer. (Her singing voice was dubbed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Wand" title="Betty Wand">Betty Wand</a>.) Dirk Bogarde expressed interest as well, but ultimately was unable to free himself from his contract with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Arthur_Rank" title="J. Arthur Rank">J. Arthur Rank</a>. Recalling <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Jourdan" title="Louis Jourdan">Louis Jourdan</a> from his performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Coins_in_the_Fountain_(1954_film)" title="Three Coins in the Fountain (1954 film)">Three Coins in the Fountain</a></i>, Freed offered him the role of Gaston.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In late April, Freed and Minnelli and their respective entourages arrived in Paris. The weather had become unseasonably hot, and working in non-airconditioned hotel rooms was uncomfortable. Minnelli began scouting locations while Freed and Lerner discussed the still incomplete script. Lerner had taken liberties with Colette's novella; the character of HonorÃ©, nonexistent in the original book and very minor in the Loos play, was now a major figure. Gigi's mother, originally a significant character, was reduced to a few lines of dialogue delivered off-screen. Lerner also expanded the focus on Gigi's relationship with her grandmother.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By mid-July, the composers had completed most of the score but still were missing the title tune. Loewe was at the piano while Lerner was indisposed in the bathroom, and when the former began playing a melody the latter liked, he later recalled he jumped up, "[his] trousers still clinging to [his] ankles, and made his way to the living room. 'Play that again,' he said. And that melody ended up being the title song for <i>Gigi</i>."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In September the cast and crew flew to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, where several interior scenes were filmed, among them the entire scene in Maxim's, which included a musical number by Jourdan. Lerner was unhappy with the look of the scene as it had been shot by Minnelli, and at considerable expense the restaurant was recreated on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundstage" title="Soundstage">soundstage</a> and the scene was refilmed by director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Walters" title="Charles Walters">Charles Walters</a>, since Minnelli was overseas working on a new project.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following completion of the film, it was previewed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California" title="Santa Barbara, California">Santa Barbara</a> in January 1958. Audience reaction was overwhelmingly favorable (88% rated it either "outstanding" or "good"), but Lerner and Loewe were dissatisfied with the end result. Lerner felt it was twenty minutes too long and most of the action too slow. The changes he proposed would cost an additional $300,000, money Freed was loath to spend. The songwriting team offered to buy 10% of the film for $300,000, then offered $3 million for the print. Impressed with their belief in the film, MGM executives agreed to the changes, which included eleven days of considerable reshooting, putting the project at $400,000 over budget. At a preview in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encino,_California" title="Encino, California">Encino</a>, audience reaction changed from "appreciation to affection," and Lerner felt the film finally was ready for release. It premiered at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_B._Jacobs_Theatre" title="Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre">Royale Theatre</a>, a legitimate theatrical venue in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, on May 15, 1958.</p>

He added, "But don't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film, for <i>Gigi</i> is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs. It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette, but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story's flavored mood and atmosphere . . . Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that, for quality and harmony, are superb."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Abel Green of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> called the film "100% escapist fare" and predicted it "is destined for a global boxoffice mopup." He added, "Alan Jay Lerner's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libretto" title="Libretto">libretto</a> is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals, and Fritz Loewe's tunes (to Lerner's lyrics) already vie with and suggest their memorable <i>My Fair Lady</i> score . . . Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role . . . Skillful casting, performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total . . . Director Minnelli's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned . . . distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production. The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg's lensing; the Beaton costumes, sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight. The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this <i>Gigi</i> a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry."</p>

The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much - it's like a meal consisting of cheesecake, and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down. No doubt inspired by the finicky, claustrophobic sets and bric-Ã -brac, the cast tries (with unfortunate success) to be more French than the French, especially Chevalier. The exception is Gingold, who inhabits, as always, a world of her own."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a></i> rated the film 3Â½ out of five stars, calling it "Overbaked but enjoyable, and a banquet for the eyes, thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming . . . Caron . . . leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French. The winner is Chevalier, in a performance that makes one feel as if you're gagging on pastry . . . Perhaps if the sweetness of <i>Gigi</i> was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity, the picture could balance itself out . . . Ten minutes into the movie, you've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou. [The film] makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks, and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets."</p>
