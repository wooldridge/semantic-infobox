It tells the story of small-time pool <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustling" title="Hustling">hustler</a> "Fast Eddie" Felson and his desire to prove himself the best player in the country by beating legendary pool player "Minnesota Fats." After initially losing to Fats and getting involved with unscrupulous manager Bert Gordon, Eddie returns to beat Fats, but only after paying a terrible personal price. The film was shot on location in New York City. It stars <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a> as Eddie Felson, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Gleason" title="Jackie Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a> as Minnesota Fats, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Laurie" title="Piper Laurie">Piper Laurie</a> as Sarah, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Scott" title="George C.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was a major critical and popular success, gaining a reputation as a modern classic. Its exploration of winning, losing, and character garnered a number of major awards; it is also credited with helping to spark a resurgence in the popularity of pool. A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Wanderone" title="Rudolf Wanderone">real pool hustler</a> was inspired to adopt the name of Gleason's character, Minnesota Fats, and to use the association with the film in his search for celebrity.</p>

Sarah cares for him and tells him she loves him, but he cannot say the words. When his thumbs heal, Eddie agrees to Bert's terms, deciding that a "twenty-five percent slice of something big is better than a hundred percent slice of nothing."</p>

Eddie loses badly and Bert refuses to keep staking him. Sarah pleads with Eddie to leave with her, saying that the world he is living in and its inhabitants are "perverted, twisted and crippled;" he refuses.

Bert arrives first and subjects Sarah to a humiliating sexual encounter. After, she scrawls "PERVERTED", "TWISTED", and "CRIPPLED" in lipstick on the bathroom mirror. Eddie arrives back at the hotel to learn that she has killed herself.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Tevis novel had been <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(law)" title="Option (law)">optioned</a> several times, including by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, but attempts to adapt it for the screen were unsuccessful.

Rossen, who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool-themed play called <i>Corner Pocket</i>, optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin" title="Bobby Darin">Bobby Darin</a>'s agent, Martin Baum, Paul Newman's agent turned down the part of Fast Eddie. Newman was originally unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless, being committed to star opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Taylor" title="Elizabeth Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a> in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_for_the_Seesaw_(film)" title="Two for the Seesaw (film)">Two for the Seesaw</a></i>. Rossen offered Darin the part after seeing him on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mike_Wallace_Interview" title="The Mike Wallace Interview">The Mike Wallace Interview</a></i>. When Taylor was forced to drop out of <i>Seesaw</i> because of shooting overruns on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_(1963_film)" title="Cleopatra (1963 film)">Cleopatra</a></i>, Newman was freed up to take the role, which he accepted after reading just half of the script. No one associated with the production officially notified Darin or his representatives that he had been replaced; they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rossen filmed <i>The Hustler</i> over six weeks, entirely in New York City. Much of the action was filmed at two now-defunct pool halls, McGirr's and Ames Billiard Academy. Other shooting locations included a townhouse on East 82nd Street, which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton's character Findley, and the Manhattan <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhound_Lines" title="Greyhound Lines">Greyhound</a> bus terminal. The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mosconi" title="Willie Mosconi">Willie Mosconi</a> served as technical advisor on the film and shot a number of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick_shot" title="Trick shot">trick shots</a> in place of the actors (except for Gleason whose shots were his own and filmed in wide-angle to show the actor and the shot in the same frames). Rossen, in pursuit of the style he termed "neo-neo-realistic", hired actual street thugs, enrolled them in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> and used them as extras. Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie is on his way to town (originally slated to be the first scene of the film) and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny's Bar which establishes Preacher is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence" title="Substance dependence">junkie</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Early shooting put more focus on the pool playing, but during filming Rossen made the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_shot" title="Two shot">two shot</a> but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Hustler</i> is fundamentally a story of what it means to be a human being, couched within the context of winning and losing. Describing the film, Robert Rossen said: "My protagonist, Fast Eddie, wants to become a great pool player, but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being. He attains self-awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has causedÂ â€” and then he wins his pool game." Roger Ebert concurs with this assessment, citing <i>The Hustler</i> as "one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering, by accepting reality instead of his dreams."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film and theatre historian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Mordden" title="Ethan Mordden">Ethan Mordden</a> has identified <i>The Hustler</i> as one of a handful of films from the early 1960s that re-defined the relationship of films to their audiences. This relationship, he writes, is "one of challenge rather than flattery, of doubt rather than certainty." No film of the 1950s, Mordden asserts, "took such a brutal, clear look at the ego-affirmation of the one-on-one contest, at the inhumanity of the winner or the castrated vulnerability of the loser." Although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" title="Film noir">film noir</a>, Mordden rejects the comparison based on Rossen's ultra-realistic style, also noting that the film lacks noir's "Treacherous Woman or its relish in discovering crime among the bourgeoisie, hungry bank clerks and lusty wives." Mordden does note that while Fast Eddie "has a slight fifties ring", the character "makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily <i>feeling</i> tough guys of the '<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Without_a_Cause" title="Rebel Without a Cause">rebel</a>' eraÂ ... [b]ut he does end up seeking out his emotions" and telling Bert that Bert is a loser because he's dead inside.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Hustler</i> had its world premiere in Washington, D.C. on September 25, 1961. Prior to the premiere, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a> hosted a midnight screening of the film for the casts of the season's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> shows, which generated a great deal of positive <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth" title="Word of mouth">word of mouth</a>. Initially reluctant to publicize the film, 20th Century Fox responded by stepping up its promotional activities.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was well-received by critics, although with the occasional caveat. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> praised the performances" of the entire main cast but felt that the "sordid aspects" of the story prevented the film from achieving the "goal of being pure entertainment." <i>Variety</i> also felt the film was far too long. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kauffmann" title="Stanley Kauffmann">Stanley Kauffmann</a>, writing for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic" title="The New Republic">The New Republic</a></i>, concurred in part with this assessment. Kauffmann strongly praised the principal cast, calling Newman "first-rate" and writing that Scott's was "his most credible performance to date." Laurie, he writes, gives her part "movingly anguished touches" (although he also mildly criticizes her for over-reliance on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting" title="Method acting">Method acting</a>). While he found that the script "strains hard to give an air of menace and criminality to the pool hall" and also declares it "full of pseudo-meaning", Kauffmann lauds Rossen's "sure, economical" direction, especially in regard to Gleason who, he says, does not so much act as "[pose] for a number of pictures which are well arranged by Rossen. It is the best use of a manikin by a director since <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_Kazan" title="Elia Kazan">Kazan</a> photographed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burl_Ives" title="Burl Ives">Burl Ives</a> as Big Daddy." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, despite finding that the film "strays a bit" and that the romance between Newman and Laurie's characters "seems a mite far-fetched", nonetheless found that <i>The Hustler</i> "speaks powerfully in a universal language that spellbinds and reveals bitter truths."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Hustler</i> received nine <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nominations.

It currently holds a 97% "fresh" rating at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, echoing earlier praise for the performances, direction, and cinematography and adding laurels for editor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dede_Allen" title="Dede Allen">Dede Allen</a>, cites the film as "one of those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories." He further cites Fast Eddie Felson as one of "only a handful of movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as touchstones." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a></i> calls the film a "dark stunner" offering "a grim world whose only bright spot is the top of the pool table, yet [with] characters [who] maintain a shabby nobility and grace." The four leads are again lavishly praised for their performances and the film is summed up as "not to be missed."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Paul Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddie Felson in the 1986 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Color_of_Money" title="The Color of Money">The Color of Money</a></i>, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. A number of observers and critics have suggested that this Oscar was in belated recognition for his performance in <i>The Hustler</i>. In 1997, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> selected <i>The Hustler</i> for preservation in the United States <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Registry" title="National Film Registry">National Film Registry</a> as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." Carroll and Rossen's screenplay was selected by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America" title="Writers Guild of America">Writers Guild of America</a> in 2006 as the 96th best motion picture screenplay of all time. In June 2008, AFI released its "Ten top Ten"â€”the best ten films in ten "classic" American film genresâ€”after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. <i>The Hustler</i> was acknowledged as the sixth best film in the sports genre.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Hustler</i> is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity of pool in the United States, which had been on the decline for decades. The film also brought recognition to Willie Mosconi, who, despite having won multiple world championships, was virtually unknown to the general public. Perhaps the greatest beneficiary of the film's popularity was a real-life pool hustler named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Wanderone" title="Rudolf Wanderone">Rudolf Wanderone</a>. Mosconi claimed in an interview at the time of the film's release that the character of Minnesota Fats was based on Wanderone, who at the time was known as "New York Fatty". Wanderone immediately adopted the Minnesota Fats nickname and parlayed his association with the film into book and television deals and other ventures. Author Walter Tevis denied for the rest of his life that Wanderone had played any role in the creation of the character. Other players would claim, with greater or lesser degrees of credibility, to have served as models for Fast Eddie, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronnie_Allen_(pool_player)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Ronnie Allen (pool player) (page does not exist)">Ronnie Allen</a>, Ed Taylor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ed_Parker_(pool_player)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Ed Parker (pool player) (page does not exist)">Ed Parker</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eddie_Pelkey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Eddie Pelkey (page does not exist)">Eddie Pelkey</a>.</p>
