	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Streep began auditioning for film roles, and later recalled an unsuccessful audition for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_De_Laurentiis" title="Dino De Laurentiis">Dino De Laurentiis</a> for the leading role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(1976_film)" title="King Kong (1976 film)">King Kong</a></i>. De Laurentiis commented to his son in Italian, "She's ugly. Why did you bring me this thing?" and was shocked when Streep replied in fluent Italian. Streep's first feature film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(1977_film)" title="Julia (1977 film)">Julia</a></i> (1977), in which she played a small but pivotal role during a flashback scene. Streep was living in New York City with her fiancÃ©, Cazale, who had been diagnosed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cancer" title="Bone cancer">bone cancer</a>. He was cast in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deer_Hunter" title="The Deer Hunter">The Deer Hunter</a></i> (1978), and Streep was delighted to secure a small role because it allowed her to remain with Cazale for the duration of filming. She was not specifically interested in the part, commenting, "They needed a girl between the two guys and I was it."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She played a leading role in the television <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries" title="Miniseries">miniseries</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_(miniseries)" title="Holocaust (miniseries)">Holocaust</a></i> (1978) as an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_race" title="Aryan race">Aryan</a> woman married to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> artist in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_era" title="Nazi era">Nazi era</a> Germany. She later explained that she had considered the material to be "unrelentingly noble", and had taken the role only because she had needed money. Streep travelled to Germany and Austria for filming while Cazale remained in New York. Upon her return, Streep found that Cazale's illness had progressed, and she nursed him until his death on March 12, 1978. She spoke of her grief and her hope that work would provide a diversion; she accepted a role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seduction_of_Joe_Tynan" title="The Seduction of Joe Tynan">The Seduction of Joe Tynan</a></i> (1979) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Alda" title="Alan Alda">Alan Alda</a>, later commenting that she played it on "automatic pilot", and performed the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_(The_Taming_of_the_Shrew)" title="Kate (The Taming of the Shrew)">Katherine</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew" title="The Taming of the Shrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a></i> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_the_Park" title="Shakespeare in the Park">Shakespeare in the Park</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Streep played a supporting role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(film)" title="Manhattan (film)">Manhattan</a></i> (1979) for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a>, later stating that she had not seen a complete script and was given only the six pages of her own scenes, and that she had not been permitted to improvise a word of her dialogue. Asked to comment on the script for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kramer_vs._Kramer" title="Kramer vs. Kramer">Kramer vs. Kramer</a></i> (1979), in a meeting with the producer Stan Jaffee, director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Benton" title="Robert Benton">Robert Benton</a> and star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>, Streep insisted that the female character was not representative of many real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles, and was written as "too evil". Jaffee, Benton and Hoffman agreed with Streep, and the script was revised. In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a mother and housewife with a career, and frequented the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_East_Side" title="Upper East Side">Upper East Side</a> neighborhood in which the film was set. Benton allowed Streep to write her dialogue in two of her key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman. Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting, "She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biographer Karen Hollinger describes this period as a downturn in the popularity of Streep's films, which reached its nadir with the failure of <i>Death Becomes Her</i>, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious but commercially unsuccessful dramas, and more significantly to the lack of options available to an actress in her forties. Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family, a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, "By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore. And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to pick your parts with great care."</p>

Blunt also drew favorable notice and nominations, as did many of those involved in the film's production. While critical reaction to the film as a whole was more measured, it was well received by the public, becoming a surprise summer box-office hit following its June 30 North American release. The commercial success and critical praise for Streep's performance continued in foreign markets, with the film leading the international box office for most of October. The U.S. DVD release likewise was the top rental during December. Ultimately, it would gross over $300 million, mostly from its international run, and finish in 2006's top 20 both in the U.S. and overseas. It is also the second highest-grossing film in Streep's career (the first being <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamma_Mia!" title="Mamma Mia!">Mamma Mia!</a></i>) and the second-highest in Hathaway's (the first being <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_(2010_film)" title="Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)">Alice in Wonderland</a></i>).</p>

Andy has to put up with Miranda's bizarre and humiliating treatment in hopes of getting a job as a reporter or writer somewhere else. At first, Andy fumbles with her job and fits in poorly with her catty coworkers, especially Miranda's senior assistant Emily Charlton (Emily Blunt).</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Andy has a talk with <i>Runway'</i>s art director Nigel (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Tucci" title="Stanley Tucci">Stanley Tucci</a>), who gives a whole new perspective of Miranda, her work and fashion in general. Andy decides to change and gradually learns her responsibilities and begins to dress more stylishly. Slowly but surely, Andy begins to sacrifice her personal life to her career. Miranda notices the change in Andy and gives her a new task: delivering "The Book" (a mock-up of the next edition's feature spreads) to her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_East_Side" title="Upper East Side">Upper East Side</a> townhome. However, Andy is tricked by Miranda's daughters into going upstairs, where she inadvertently walks in on Miranda and her husband arguing. Mortified, she drops the book and leaves.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Miranda punishes Andy by giving her an impossible task: securing the unpublished manuscript for the next book in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a></i> series for her twin daughters to read on the train. Andy is just about to quit when Christian Thompson, a famous writer and acquaintance of Andy's informs her he has gotten it for her. Andy delivers the copies to a stunned Miranda and keeps her job, much to her boyfriend's disappointment.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Emily falls ill, Miranda commands Andy to accompany the two of them to a charity benefit, where the two masquerade as partygoers while actually reminding her of important information about the people approaching her for a greeting. At the event, Andy saves Miranda from being embarrassed by Emily, who had forgotten one of the names; meets Jacqueline Follet, the editor-in-chief of French <i>Runway</i> and Miranda's rival; turns down an offer to meet a big publisher from Christian, but all the while misses her boyfriend's birthday party.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Paris, Andy attends the shows and even meets designer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Garavani" title="Valentino Garavani">Garavani Valentino</a>, being introduced as â€œthe new Emilyâ€&#157;. One night Andy comes into Miranda's suite only to find her in her bathrobe, undressed, and crying. While deciding on a seating chart, Miranda opens up saying that her husband is divorcing her, but that her biggest worry is for her daughters, who have lost yet another father figure. Later, Andy learns from Nigel that he has gotten a job as creative director at fashion designer James Holt's new company. Andy has dinner with Christian who figures out that she is single again. After a few glasses of wine she succumbs to Christian's charms and sleeps with him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his hotel room the next morning, while dressing, Andy finds out that <i>Runway</i> 's owner is planning to replace Miranda with Jacqueline Follet. Andy storms out to find Miranda and warn her. When Andy finally tells her, Miranda seems unfazed. At a luncheon in honor of James Holt, Miranda announces that Jacqueline will be the new creative director of James Holt's company much to the surprise of Andy and Nigel.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">En route to another event, Miranda explains to a still-stunned Andy that she knew about the plan to get rid of her all along, but she found an alternative for Jacqueline and presented "the list" (a list of all the designers, stylists, company owners, and models that were "raised and nurtured" by Miranda and who have promised their loyalty to her whenever and should she ever leave <i>Runway</i>) to the owner of <i>Runway</i>, who realized that without those people, <i>Runway</i> would be doomed, was forced to reconsider. Miranda also says that she was pleased by Andy's display of loyalty and that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy says she could never do to anyone what Miranda did to Nigel.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Frankel" title="David Frankel">David Frankel</a> and producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Finerman" title="Wendy Finerman">Wendy Finerman</a> had originally read <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> in book proposal form. It would be Frankel's second theatrical feature. He, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer" title="Cinematographer">cinematographer</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Ballhaus" title="Florian Ballhaus">Florian Ballhaus</a> and costume designer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Field" title="Patricia Field">Patricia Field</a>, drew heavily on their experience in making <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City" title="Sex and the City">Sex and the City</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_photography" title="Principal photography">Principal photography</a> took place over 57 days in New York and Paris between October and December 2005. The film's budget was $35 million.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ballhaus, at Finerman and Frankel's suggestion, composed as many shots as possible, whether interiors or exteriors, to at least partially take in busy New York street scenes in the background, to convey the excitement of working in a glamorous industry in New York. He also used a handheld <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_camera" title="Movie camera">camera</a> during some of the busier meeting scenes in Miranda's office, to better convey the flow of action, and slow motion for Andrea's entrance into the office following her makeover. A few <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_shot" title="Process shot">process shots</a> were necessary, mainly to put exterior views behind windows on sets and in the Mercedes where Miranda and Andrea are having their climactic conversation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Streep made a conscious decision not to play the part as a direct impression of Wintour, right down to not using an accent and making the character American rather than English ("I felt it was too restricting"). "I think she wanted people not to confuse the character of Miranda Priestly with Anna Wintour at all," said Frankel. "And that's why early on in the process she decided on a very different look for her and a different approach to the character." The "that's all," "please bore someone else ..." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_phrase" title="Catch phrase">catch phrases</a>; her coat-tossing on Andrea's desk and discarded <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak" title="Steak">steak</a> lunch are retained from the novel. Streep prepared by reading a book by Wintour protegÃ© <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Tilberis" title="Liz Tilberis">Liz Tilberis</a> and the memos of <i>Vogue</i> editor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Vreeland" title="Diana Vreeland">Diana Vreeland</a>. She lost enough weight during shooting that the clothes had to be taken in.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hathaway prepared for the part by volunteering for a week as an assistant at an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction" title="Auction">auction</a> house; Frankel said she was "terrified" before starting her first scene with Streep. The older actress began her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first "I think you're perfect for the role and I'm so happy we're going to be working on this together" then warning her that was the last nice thing she would say. Streep applied this philosophy to everyone else on set as well, keeping her distance from the cast and crewmembers unless it was necessary to discuss something with her.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She also suggested the editorial meeting scene, which does not advance the plot but shows Miranda at work without Andrea present. It was also her idea that Miranda not wear makeup in the scene where she opens up to Andrea and worries about the effect on her daughters of her divorce becoming public knowledge.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frankel, who had worked with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Field" title="Patricia Field">Patricia Field</a>, before on his feature-film debut, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Rhapsody" title="Miami Rhapsody">Miami Rhapsody</a></i> as well as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City" title="Sex and the City">Sex and the City</a></i>, knew that what the cast wore would be of utmost importance in a movie set in the fashion industry. "My approach was to hire her and then leave the room," he joked later.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While none appeared onscreen, designers were very helpful to Field. Her $100,000 budget for the film's costumes was supplemented by help from friends from throughout the industry. Ultimately, she believes, at least $1 million worth of clothing was used in the film, making it one of the most expensively costumed movies in cinema history. The single priciest item was a $100,000 Fred Leighton <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necklace" title="Necklace">necklace</a> on Streep.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanel" title="Chanel">Chanel</a> asked to dress Hathaway for the film, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolce_%26_Gabbana" title="Dolce &amp; Gabbana">Dolce &amp; Gabbana</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Klein" title="Calvin Klein">Calvin Klein</a> helped Field as well. Although Field avoids making Streep look like Wintour, she dresses her in generous helpings of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prada" title="Prada">Prada</a>. (By Field's own estimate, 40% of the shoes on Streep's feet are Prada.) Field added that much of the audience would not be familiar with Wintour's look and that "Meryl looks nothing like Anna, so even if I wanted to copy Anna, I couldn't." But, like Wintour and her <i>Vogue</i> predecessor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Vreeland" title="Diana Vreeland">Diana Vreeland</a>, the two realized that Miranda needed a signature look, which was provided primarily by the white <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wig_(hair)" title="Wig (hair)">wig</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forelock" title="Forelock">forelock</a> she wore as well as the clothes the two spent much time poring over look-books for. Field said she avoided prevailing fashion trends for Miranda during production in favor of a more timeless look based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Karan" title="Donna Karan">Donna Karan</a> archives and pieces by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaele_Vollbracht" title="Michaele Vollbracht">Michaele Vollbracht</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Blass_Limited" title="Bill Blass Limited">Bill Blass</a>, a look she describes as "rich-lady clothes." She didn't want people to easily recognize what Miranda was wearing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She contrasted Andrea and Emily by giving Andrea a "textbook" sense of style, without much risk-taking, that would suggest clothing a fashion magazine would have on hand for shoots. Much of her high-fashion wardrobe is Chanel, with some <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Klein" title="Calvin Klein">Calvin Klein</a> thrown in for good measure. Blunt, on the other hand was "so on the edge she's almost falling off." For her, Field chose pieces by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivienne_Westwood" title="Vivienne Westwood">Vivienne Westwood</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Owens" title="Rick Owens">Rick Owens</a>, to suggest a taste for funkier, more "underground" clothing. After the film's release, some of the looks Field chose became popular, to the filmmakers' amusement.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He found one <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dries_van_Noten" title="Dries van Noten">Dries van Noten</a> tie he wore during the film to his liking and kept it.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After touring some offices of real fashion magazines, Jess Gonchor gave the <i>Runway</i> offices a clean, white look meant to suggest a makeup compact ("the chaste beiges and whites of impervious authority," <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Denby_(film_critic)" title="David Denby (film critic)">Denby</a> called it). Miranda's office bears some strong similarities to the real office of Anna Wintour, down to an octagonal mirror on the wall, photographs and a floral arrangement on the desk (a similarity so marked Wintour had her office redecorated after the movie). The magazine itself is very similar to <i>Vogue</i>, and one of the covers on the wall of the office, showing three models, is a direct <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage" title="Homage">homage</a> to the August 2004 cover of that magazine.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She even chose separate computer wallpaper to highlight different aspects of Blunt's and Hathaway's character: Paris's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe" title="Arc de Triomphe">Arc de Triomphe</a> on Blunt's suggests her aspirations to accompany Miranda to the shows there, while the floral image on Andy's suggests the natural, unassuming qualities she displays at the outset of her tenure with the magazine. For the photo of Andrea with her parents, Hathaway posed with her own mother and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marshall_Grant" title="David Marshall Grant">David Marshall Grant</a>. One of the purported Harry Potter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript" title="Manuscript">manuscripts</a> was later sold at auction for $586 on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay" title="EBay">eBay</a>, along with various clothing used in the film, to benefit Dress for Success, a charity which provides business clothing to help women transition into the workforce.</p>

Accordingly, he cut a number of primarily transitional scenes, such as Andrea's job interview and the <i>Runway</i> staff's trip to Holt's studio. He also took out a scene early on where Miranda complimented Andrea. Upon reviewing them for the DVD, Frankel admitted he hadn't even seen them before, since Livolsi didn't include them in any prints he sent to the director.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frankel praised Livolsi for making the film's four key <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montage_(film)" title="Montage (film)">montages</a>Â â€” the opening credits, Miranda's coat-tossing, Andrea's makeover and the Paris introductionÂ â€” work. The third was particularly challenging as it uses passing cars and other obstructions to cover Hathaway's changes of outfit. Some scenes were also created in the editing room, such as the reception at the museum, where Livolsi wove <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-roll" title="B-roll">B-roll</a> footage in to keep the action flowing.</p>

The first was the creation of the red <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiletto_heel" title="Stiletto heel">stiletto heel</a> ending in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork" title="Pitchfork">pitchfork</a> as the film's teaser <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_poster" title="Movie poster">poster</a>. It was so successful and effective, becoming almost "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon" title="Icon">iconic</a>" (in Finerman's words), that it was used for the actual release poster as well. It became a brand, and was eventually used on every medium related to the filmÂ â€” the tie-in reprinting of the novel and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack_album" title="Soundtrack album">soundtrack</a> and DVD covers as well.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studio also put together a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(film)" title="Trailer (film)">trailer</a> of scenes and images strictly from the first three minutes of the film, in which Andrea meets Miranda for the first time, to be used at previews and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_festival" title="Film festival">film festivals</a> until they could create a more standard trailer drawing from the whole film. But, again, this proved so effective with early audiences it was retained as the main trailer, since it created anticipation for the rest of the film without giving anything away.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film did surprisingly well with audiences both inside and outside the U.S. Critics gave a fairly positive reaction to the film as a whole. Streep's performance drew universal acclaim, with some going as far as saying it was the only reason to see the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> reported the film had an average score of 62%, based on 40 reviews. The film holds a 75% fresh rating on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 184 reviews.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initial reviews of the film focused primarily on Streep's performance, praising her for making an extremely unsympathetic character far more complex than she had been in the novel. "With her silver hair and pale skin, her whispery diction as perfect as her posture, Ms. Streep's Miranda inspires both terror and a measure of awe," wrote <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._O._Scott" title="A. O. Scott">A. O. Scott</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>. "No longer simply the incarnation of evil, she is now a vision of aristocratic, purposeful and surprisingly human grace." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Smith" title="Kyle Smith">Kyle Smith</a> agreed at the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</a></i>: "The snaky Streep wisely chooses not to imitate <i>Vogue</i> editrix Anna Wintour, the inspiration for the book, but creates her own surprisingly believable character." "Wintour should be flattered by Streep's portrayal," agreed Jack Mathews in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News" title="New York Daily News">Daily News</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Edelstein" title="David Edelstein">David Edelstein</a>, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)" title="New York (magazine)">New York</a></i> magazine, criticized the film as "thin", but praised Streep for her "fabulous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism" title="Minimalism">minimalist</a> performance." J. Hoberman, Edelstein's onetime colleague at <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice" title="The Village Voice">The Village Voice</a></i>, called the movie an improvement on the book and said Streep was "the scariest, most nuanced, funniest movie villainess since <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilda_Swinton" title="Tilda Swinton">Tilda Swinton</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi" title="Nazi">nazified</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Witch" title="White Witch">White Witch</a> [in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_in_film" title="2005 in film">2005's</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia:_The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe" title="The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a></i>]."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blunt, too, earned some favorable notice. "[She] has many of the movie's best lines and steals nearly every scene she's in," wrote Clifford Pugh in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Chronicle" title="Houston Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a></i>. Other reviewers and fans concurred.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the movie "thumbs down," while <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Roeper" title="Richard Roeper">Richard Roeper</a> gave it a "thumbs up."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While all critics were in agreement about Streep and Blunt, they pointed to other weaknesses, particularly in the story. Reviewers familiar with Weisberger's novel assented to her judgement that McKenna's script greatly improved upon it. A rare exception was Angela Baldassare at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Microsoft_Network" title="The Microsoft Network">MSN</a> Canada, who felt the film needed more of the nastiness others had told her was abundant in the novel.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Denby" title="David Denby">David Denby</a> summed up this response in his <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">New Yorker</a></i> review: "<i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> tells a familiar story, and it never goes much below the surface of what it has to tell. Still, what a surface!"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reactions to Hathaway's performance were not as unanimous as for many of her costars. Denby said "she suggests, with no more than a panicky sidelong glance, what Weisberger takes pages to describe." On the other hand, to Baldassare, she "barely carrie[d] the load."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amid the generally positive reception for the film, there were two criticisms apart from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a>. Some journalists familiar with the fashion world thought its portrayal unrealistic, and some gay viewers took issue with how the film presented Nigel.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Booth Moore at <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> chided Field for creating a "fine fashion fantasy with little to do with reality," a world that reflects what outsiders think fashion is like rather than what the industry actually is. Unlike the movie, in her experience fashionistas were less likely to wear makeup and more likely to value edgier dressing styles (that would not include <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe_ring" title="Toe ring">toe rings</a>). "If they want a documentary, they can watch the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_Channel" title="History Channel">History Channel</a>," retorted Field. Another newspaper fashion writer, Hadley Freeman of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i>, likewise complained the film was awash in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism" title="Sexism">sexism</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clich%C3%A9" title="ClichÃ©">clichÃ©s</a> that, to her, beset movies about fashion in general.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Charla Krupp, the executive editor of SHOP, Inc., says "It's the first film I've seen that got it right ... [It] has the nuances of the politics and the tension better than any filmÂ â€” and the backstabbing and sucking-up." Joanna Coles, the editor of the U.S. edition of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Claire" title="Marie Claire">Marie Claire</a></i>, agreed:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ginia Bellefante, former fashion reporter for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, also agreed, calling it "easily the truest portrayal of fashion culture since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unzipped_(film)" title="Unzipped (film)">Unzipped</a></i>" and giving it credit for depicting the way fashion had changed in the early 21st century. Her colleague Ruth La Ferla found a different opinion from industry insiders after a special preview screening. Most found the fashion in the movie too safe and the beauty too overstated, more in tune with the 1980s than the 2000s. "My job is to present an entertainment, a world people can visit and take a little trip," responded Field.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stanley Tucci told the gay magazine <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(magazine)" title="Out (magazine)">Out</a></i> that he played the part with no doubt whatsoever that the character was gay. While many viewers, gay and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexual" title="Heterosexual">straight</a>, shared the assumption, nothing in the film directly suggests his sexual orientation other than a brief glance he makes at an attractive man. In the novel, he, and the other male <i>Runway</i> staffers are very <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out" title="Coming out">out</a>, often described as flamboyant, freely discussing their sex lives, and sometimes checking each other out.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is none of this in the film. Instead, Nigel tells Andrea that, as a child, he told his family he was attending <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer" title="Soccer">soccer</a> practice when he was really taking <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewing" title="Sewing">sewing</a> lessons, and read <i>Runway</i> under the covers of his bed at night with a flashlight. Finerman also says that during his first scene in the film, his visit to Andrea's hotel room in Paris to celebrate his imminent promotion, they had not yet decided how "extravagant" he would be. The film also gives no indication that he is involved in any male/female marriage or relationship with a woman. No other male staffer or editor has a significant part and indeed there is no reference to homosexuality at all. Jeffy and James, two of the gay men in the novel, were eliminated. One viewer, David Poland, pointed out this aspect of the film on his blog, <i>The Hot Button</i>, but noted it was part of a general desexualization that led him to call the movie <i>No Sex in the City</i>. On the other hand, a gay viewer who blogs about gay content in movies as Queer Beacon, found Tucci's portrayal refreshingly free of overdone stereotypes, while another gay blogger expressed his displeasure that a movie about an industry well-known for its openly gay men seemed so determined to avoid the subject. Controversy notwithstanding, readers of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay.com" title="Gay.com">Gay.com</a> voted the film the best of 2006. William Maltese, from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AfterElton.com" title="AfterElton.com">AfterElton.com</a>, called it "refreshing that the jokes in <i>Devil</i> do not come at Nigel's expense or because of his sexuality." It is also mentioned that Nigel is key for Andy's transformation from ugly-duck-to-swan that propels her into the second half of the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queer_Beacon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Queer Beacon (page does not exist)">Queer Beacon</a></i> also wondered if Doug might be gay, since he is more aware of Miranda's importance to fashion than Andrea; also, later, when Lily takes him from Andrea at the gallery to introduce him to "someone he might find interesting," she doesn't specify that person's gender. Sommer wrote that Doug was not written to be gay and was merely based on a friend of McKenna's.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On its opening weekend, the film was on 2,847 screens. It grossed $27 million, second only to the much bigger-budget <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_Returns" title="Superman Returns">Superman Returns</a></i>, and added $13 million more during the first week. This success led Fox to add 35 more screens the next week, the widest domestic distribution the film enjoyed. Although it was never any week's top-grossing film, it remained in the top 10 through July. Its theatrical run continued through December 10, shortly before the DVD release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It had a very successful run in theaters, making nearly $125 million in the United States and Canada and over $325 million worldwide, a career high for both Meryl Streep, until <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamma_Mia_(film)" title="Mamma Mia (film)">Mamma Mia</a></i> was released in 2008 and surpassed it, and Anne Hathaway, until <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_(2010_film)" title="Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)">Alice in Wonderland</a></i> surpassed it in 2010.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour" title="Anna Wintour">Anna Wintour</a> attended the film's New York <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere" title="Premiere">premiere</a>, wearing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prada" title="Prada">Prada</a>. Her friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Amiel" title="Barbara Amiel">Barbara Amiel</a> reported that she said shortly afterward that the movie would go straight to DVD. But in an interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Walters" title="Barbara Walters">Barbara Walters</a> that aired the day the DVD was released, she called the film "really entertaining" and said she appreciated the "decisive" nature of Streep's portrayal. "Anything that makes fashion entertaining and glamorous and interesting is wonderful for our industry. So I was 100 percent behind it." Streep said Wintour was "probably more upset by the book than the film."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A couple of weeks after the film's release, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters" title="Reuters">Reuters</a> reported a striking phenomenon: <i>All</i> of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company" title="Public company">publicly traded companies</a> that made products featured in the film had seen their <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_(finance)" title="Share (finance)">share</a> prices fall in that time. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_analyst" title="Industry analyst">Analysts</a> attributed the fall to the effect of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_price_increases_since_2003" title="Oil price increases since 2003">rising gas prices</a> on the economy, which led many consumers to cut back their purchases of luxury brands, rather than anything associated with the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> topped the charts on its first major European release weekend on October 9, after a strong September Oceania and Latin America opening. It would be the highest-grossing film that weekend in Britain, Spain and Russia, taking in $41.5 million overall. Continued strong weekends as it opened across the rest of Europe helped it remain atop the overseas charts for the rest of the month. By the end of the year only its Chinese opening remained; it was released there on February 28, 2007.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most reviews from the international press echoed the domestic response, heaping praise on Streep and the other actors, but calling the whole film "predictable." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a>'</i>s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bradshaw" title="Peter Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a>, who found the film "moderately entertaining," took Blunt to task, calling her a "real disappointment ... strained and awkward." In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i>, Anthony Quinn said Streep "may just have given us a classic here" and concluded that the film as a whole was "as snappy and juicy as fresh bubblegum."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In most markets the title remained unchanged; either the English was used or a translation into the local language. The only exceptions were Argentina, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela, where it was <i>El diablo que viste Prada</i> and <i>El diablo se viste Ã  la moda</i>. In Poland, the title was <i>DiabeÅ‚ ubiera siÄ™ u Prady</i> which roughly means "The Devil Dresses in Prada" rather than "The Devil Wears Prada." In Turkey, the title was "Åžeytan Marka Giyer," roughly translated as "The Devil Wears Brand-Names." In Romania, the title was "Diavolul se Ã®mbracÄƒ de la Prada," which roughly means "The Devil Dresses itself from Prada", the same construction being found in the French title, "Le Diable s'habille en Prada". The Japanese version is titled "ãƒ—ãƒ©ãƒ€ã‚’ç&#157;€ã&#129;Ÿæ‚ªé­”", which translates as "The devil who wore Prada".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three months after the film's North American release (October 2006), Frankel and Weisberger jointly accepted the first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quill_Awards" title="Quill Awards">Quill</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> Blockbuster Book to Film Award.

It also includes gag shots such as a chubby crewmember in loose-fitting clothing walking along the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwalk" title="Catwalk">runway</a> at the fashion show, and Streep announcing "I have some nude photographs to show you" at the Paris brunch scene. Unlike most blooper reels, it is not a collection of sequential takes but rather a fast-paced montage set to music from the film with many backstage shots and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_screen_(film)" title="Split screen (film)">split screenshot</a> allowing the viewer to compare the actual shot with the blooper. The many shots of actors touching their noses are, Rich Sommer says, a game played to assign blame for ruined takes.</li>

	    <li>"Getting Valentino," covering how the designer was persuaded to appear as himself in the film.</li>
	    <li>"Boss From Hell," a short segment on difficult, nightmarish superiors like Priestly.</li>

	<li>Fifteen <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleted_scene" title="Deleted scene">deleted scenes</a>, with commentary from Frankel and Livolsi available (see below).</li>

The DVD is available in both full screen and widescreen versions. Pictures of the cast and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagline" title="Tagline">tagline</a> "Hell on Heels" were added to the red-heel image for the cover. It was released in the UK on February 5, 2007.</p>

The featurettes were dropped and replaced with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitle" title="Subtitle">subtitle</a> pop-up trivia track that can be watched by itself or along with the audio commentary.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Immediately upon its December 12 release, it became the top rental in the USA. It held that spot through the end of the year, adding another $26.5 million to the film's grosses. The following week it made its debut on the DVD sales charts in third position.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the deleted scenes are some that added more background information to the story, with commentary available by the editor and director. Most were deleted by Livolsi in favor of keeping the plot focused on the conflict between Miranda and Andrea, often without consulting Frankel.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frankel generally approved of his editor's choices, but differed on one scene, showing Andrea on her errand to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Klein" title="Calvin Klein">Calvin Klein</a> showroom. He felt that scene showed Andrea's job was about more than running personal errands for Miranda.</p>
