	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><b>Raging Bull</b></i> is a 1980 American biographical film directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, adapted by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Schrader" title="Paul Schrader">Paul Schrader</a> and Mardik Martin from the Jake La Motta memoir <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raging_Bull:_My_Story" title="Raging Bull: My Story">Raging Bull: My Story</a></i>. It stars <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_LaMotta" title="Jake LaMotta">Jake LaMotta</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight" title="Middleweight">middleweight</a> boxer whose <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochistic" title="Sadomasochistic">sadomasochistic</a> rage, sexual jealousy, and animalistic appetite exceeded the boundaries of the prizefight ring, and destroyed his relationship with his wife and family.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese was partially convinced by De Niro to develop the project, though he eventually came to relate to La Motta's story. Schrader re-wrote Martin's first screenplay, and Scorsese and De Niro together made uncredited contributions thereafter. Pesci was an unknown actor prior to the film, as was Moriarty, who was suggested for her role by Pesci. During <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_photography" title="Principal photography">principal photography</a>, each of the boxing scenes were choreographed for a specific visual style and De Niro gained approximately 60Â pounds (27 kg) to portray La Motta in his early post-boxing years. Scorsese was exacting in the process of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-production" title="Post-production">editing and mixing</a> the film, expecting it to be his last major feature.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After receiving mixed initial reviews (and criticism due to its violent content), it went on to garner a high critical reputation and is now widely regarded among the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Films_considered_the_greatest_ever" title="Films considered the greatest ever">greatest films ever made</a>, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i>, renowned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture" title="Motion picture">motion picture</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian" title="Historian">historian</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Halliwell" title="Leslie Halliwell">Leslie Halliwell</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(magazine)" title="Empire (magazine)">Empire</a></i> magazine, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Film" title="Total Film">Total Film</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_4" title="Film 4">Film 4</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Film_Institute" title="British Film Institute">BFI</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_and_Sound" title="Sight and Sound">Sight and Sound</a></i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Movie_Classics" title="American Movie Classics">AMC</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmsite.org" title="Filmsite.org">FilmSite</a>.

A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashback</a> to 1941 shows his first loss in a major boxing match, against Jimmy Reeves. Jake's brother <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_LaMotta" title="Joey LaMotta">Joey LaMotta</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pesci" title="Joe Pesci">Joe Pesci</a>) later discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia" title="Mafia">Mafia</a> connections, Salvy Batts (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vincent" title="Frank Vincent">Frank Vincent</a>). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Moriarty" title="Cathy Moriarty">Cathy Moriarty</a>) at an open-air swimming pool in his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx" title="Bronx">Bronx</a> neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. Jake defeats <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Ray_Robinson" title="Sugar Ray Robinson">Sugar Ray Robinson</a> once in 1943 but loses to him three weeks later when the judges rule in favor of Robinson, whom Joey feels won only because he was enlisting into Army the following week. Jake is married to Vickie by 1947.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Jake's fears grow about Vickie having feelings for other men, particularly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Janiro" title="Tony Janiro">Tony Janiro</a>, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he shows off his sexual jealousy when he defeats Janiro in front of the local <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_boss" title="Mob boss">Mob boss</a>, Tommy Como (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Colasanto" title="Nicholas Colasanto">Nicholas Colasanto</a>) and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana_(nightclub)" title="Copacabana (nightclub)">Copacabana</a>, he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which he has control over, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. Despite the suspension, he eventually wins the middleweight championship title against <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Cerdan" title="Marcel Cerdan">Marcel Cerdan</a> in 1949.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A year later, Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy at the Copacabana because of Vickie. Jake then asks if Joey had an affair with her; Joey refuses to answer, insults Jake, and decides to leave. Jake directly asks Vickie about the affair and she sarcastically states that she had sex with the entire neighborhood (including his brother, Salvy, and Tommy Como) after he breaks down the bathroom door where she briefly hides from him. Jake angrily walks to Joey's house and brutally beats him up in front of Vickie and Joey's wife and children. After defending his championship belt in a brutal fifteen round bout against <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Dauthuille" title="Laurent Dauthuille">Laurent Dauthuille</a> in 1950, he makes a call to his brother after the fight, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting and cursing at him, Jake says nothing and hangs up. Estranged from Joey, Jake's career begins to slowly decline and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 1956, Jake and his family have moved to Miami. After staying out all night at his new nightclub there, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce (which she has been planning since his retirement). He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls (posing as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age" title="Legal drinking age">21-year-olds</a>) to men and serves a jail sentence in 1957 after failing to raise enough bribe money by taking the jewels out of his championship belt instead of selling the belt itself. In his jail cell, Jake pounds the walls, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he happens upon his estranged brother Joey, who forgives him but is elusive. Going back to the beginning sequence, Jake refers to the "I coulda' have been a contender" scene from the 1954 movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i> starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a> complaining that his brother should have been there for him but is also keen enough to give himself some slack. After a stage hand informs him that the auditorium where he is about to perform is crowded, Jake starts to chant "I'm the boss" while <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowboxing" title="Shadowboxing">shadowboxing</a>. The film ends on an ambiguous note with the Biblical quote,</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Raging Bull</i> came about when De Niro read the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raging_Bull:_My_Story" title="Raging Bull: My Story">autobiography upon which the film is based</a> on the set of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_(film)" title="1900 (film)">1900</a></i>. Although disappointed by the book's writing style, he became fascinated by the character of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_LaMotta" title="Jake LaMotta">Jake LaMotta</a> when he showed the book to Martin Scorsese on the set of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Doesn%27t_Live_Here_Anymore" title="Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore">Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</a></i> as a means to hopefully consider the project. Scorsese repeatedly turned down his offers by resisting the director's chair, claiming he had no idea what <i>Raging Bull</i> was about, even though he did read some chapters of the text. The book was then passed onto Mardick Martin, the film's eventual co-screenwriter, who said "the trouble is the damn thing has been done a hundred times before â€” a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him". The book was even shown to producer Irwin Winkler by De Niro, who was willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed. After nearly dying from a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose" title="Drug overdose">drug overdose</a>, Scorsese agreed to make the film for De Niro's sake, not only to save his own life but also to save what remained of his career. Scorsese knew that he could relate to the story of Jake LaMotta as a way to redeem himself when he saw the role being portrayed as an everyman that "...the ring becomes an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory" title="Allegory">allegory</a> of life" making the project a very personal one to him.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preparation for the film began with Scorsese shooting some 8mm color footage featuring De Niro boxing in a ring. One night when the footage was being shown to De Niro, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chapman_(cinematographer)" title="Michael Chapman (cinematographer)">Michael Chapman</a>, and his friend and mentor, the English director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Powell_(director)" title="Michael Powell (director)">Michael Powell</a>, Powell pointed out that color of the gloves at the time would have only been maroon, oxblood, or even black. Scorsese decided to use this as one of the reasons to film <i>Raging Bull</i> in black and white. Other reasons would be to distinguish the film from other color films around the time and to acknowledge the problem of fading color film stock - an issue Scorsese recognized. Scorsese even went to two matches at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> to aid his research, picking up on minor but essential details such as the blood sponge and latterly, the blood on the ropes (which would later be used in the film).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the guidance of Winkler, Mardik Martin was asked to start writing the screenplay. According to De Niro, under no circumstances would <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Artists" title="United Artists">United Artists</a> accept Mardik Martin's script. The story was based on the vision of journalist Peter Hamill of a 1930s and 1940s style, when boxing was known as "the great dark prince of sports". De Niro was unimpressed when he finished reading the first draft, however. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_Driver" title="Taxi Driver">Taxi Driver</a></i> screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Schrader" title="Paul Schrader">Paul Schrader</a> was swiftly brought in to re-write the script around August 1978. Some of the changes that Schrader made to the script saw a re-write of the scene with the uncooked steak and inclusion of LaMotta seen masturbating in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> cell. The character of LaMotta's brother, Joey, was finally added, previously absent from Martin's script. United Artists saw a massive improvement on the quality of the script. However, its chief executives, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Bach" title="Steven Bach">Steven Bach</a> and David Field, met up with Scorsese, De Niro, and producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin_Winkler" title="Irwin Winkler">Irwin Winkler</a> in November 1978 to say they were worried that the content would be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-rated" title="X-rated">X-rated</a> material and have no chance of finding an audience.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Scorsese, the script was left to him and De Niro, and they spent two and a half weeks on the island of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Martin" title="Saint Martin">Saint Martin</a>, extensively re-building the content of the film. The most significant change would be the entire scene when LaMotta fixes his television and then accuses his wife of having an affair. Other changes included the removal of Jake and Joey's father; the reduction of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime" title="Organized crime">organized crime</a>'s role in the story and a major re-write of LaMotta's fight with Tony Janiro. They were even responsible for the end sequence where LaMotta is all alone in his dressing room quoting the "I could have been a contender" scene from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i>. An extract of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_(play)" title="Richard III (play)">Richard III</a></i> had been pondered but <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Powell_(director)" title="Michael Powell (director)">Michael Powell</a> thought it would be a bad decision within the context of a film that was American. According to Steven Bach, the first two screenwriters (Mardick Martin and Paul Schrader) would receive credit but since there was no payment to the writer's guild on the script, De Niro and Scorsese's work would remain uncredited.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of Scorsese's trademarks was casting many actors and actresses new to the profession, which on this occasion there would be no exception. De Niro, who was already committed to play Jake LaMotta, began to help Scorsese track down unfamiliar names to play his on-screen brother, Joey, and wife, Vickie. The role of Joey LaMotta was the first to be cast. De Niro was watching a low budget television film called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Collector" title="The Death Collector">The Death Collector</a></i> when he saw the part of a young career criminal played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pesci" title="Joe Pesci">Joe Pesci</a> (then an unknown and struggling actor) as an ideal candidate. Prior to receiving a call from De Niro and Scorsese for the proposal to star in the film, Pesci had not worked in film for four years and was running an Italian restaurant in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>. Pesci initially claimed that it would have to be a good role for him to consider it, and he later accepted the part.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of Vickie LaMotta, Jake's second wife, would have interest across the board, but Pesci who suggested the actress, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Moriarty" title="Cathy Moriarty">Cathy Moriarty</a>, from a picture he once saw at a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> disco. Both De Niro and Scorsese believed that Moriarty could portray the role after meeting with her on several occasions and noticing her husky voice and physical maturity. The duo had to prove to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> that she was right for the role when Cis Corman showed 10 comparing pictures of both Moriarty and the real Vickie LaMotta for proof she had a resemblance. Moriarty was then asked to take a screen test which she managedâ€”partly aided with some improvised lines from De Niro â€” after some confusion wondering why the crew were filming her take. Joe Pesci also persuaded his former show-biz pal and co-star in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Collector" title="The Death Collector">The Death Collector</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vincent" title="Frank Vincent">Frank Vincent</a> to try for the role of Salvy Batts. Following a successful audition and screen test, Vincent received the call to say he had received the part. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Scorsese" title="Charles Scorsese">Charles Scorsese</a>, the director's father, made his film debut as Tommy Como's cousin, Charlie.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While in the midst of practicing a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_accent" title="Bronx accent">Bronx accent</a> and preparing for his role, De Niro met both LaMotta and his ex-wife, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikki_LaMotta" title="Vikki LaMotta">Vikki</a> on separate occasions. Vikki, who lived in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, would tell stories about her life with her former husband and also show old home movies (that would later inspire a similar sequence to be done for the film). Jake LaMotta, on the other hand, would serve as his trainer accompanied by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Silvani" title="Al Silvani">Al Silvani</a> as coach at the Gramercy club in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> getting him into shape. The actor found that boxing came naturally to him; he entered as a middleweight boxer, winning two of his three fights in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> ring dubbed "young LaMotta" by the commentator. According to Jake LaMotta, he felt that De Niro was one of his top 20 best middleweight boxers of all time.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to production mixer, Michael Evje, the film began shooting at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> Olympic Auditorium on April 16, 1979. Grips hung huge curtains of black Duvetyne on all four sides of the ring area to contain the artificial smoke used extensively for visual effect. On May 7, the production moved to the Culver City Studio, Stage 3, and filmed there until the middle of June. Scorsese made it clear during filming that he did not appreciate the traditional way in films to show fights from the spectators' view. He insisted that one camera operated by the Director of Photography, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chapman_(cinematographer)" title="Michael Chapman (cinematographer)">Michael Chapman</a> would be placed inside the ring as he would play the role of an opponent keeping out of the way of other fighters so that we could see the emotions of the fighters, including those of Jake. The precise moves of the boxers would be done as dance routines from the information of a book about dance instructors in the mode of Arthur Murray. A punching bag which sat in the middle of the ring was used by De Niro between takes before aggressively coming straight on to do the next scene. The initial five-week schedule for the shooting of the boxing scenes took longer than expected, putting Scorsese under pressure.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Scorsese, production of the film was then closed down for around four months with the entire crew being paid, so De Niro could go on a binge eating trip around <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy" title="Northern Italy">Northern Italy</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>. When he did come back to the United States, his weight increased from 145 to 215Â pounds (66 to 97Â kg). The scenes with the heftier Jake LaMotta â€” which include announcing his retirement from boxing and LaMotta ending up in a Florida cell â€” were completed while approaching <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> 1979 within seven to eight weeks so as not to aggravate the health issues which were already affecting De Niro's posture, breathing, and talking.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The final sequence where Jake LaMotta is sitting in front of his mirror was filmed on the last day of shooting taking 19 takes, with only the thirteenth one being used for the film. Scorsese wanted to have an atmosphere that would be so cold that the words would have an impact as he tries to come to terms with his relationship with his brother.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The editing of <i>Raging Bull</i> began when production was temporarily put on hold and was completed in 1980. Scorsese worked with the editor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Schoonmaker" title="Thelma Schoonmaker">Thelma Schoonmaker</a> to achieve a final cut of the film. Their main decision was to ditch Schrader's idea of LaMotta's nightclub act intervening with the flashback of his youth and instead just follow along the lines of a single flashback where only scenes of LaMotta practicing his stand-up would be left "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookend_scene" title="Bookend scene">bookending</a>" the film. A sound mix arranged by Frank Warner was a delicate process taking six months. According to Scorsese, the sound on <i>Raging Bull</i> was difficult because each punch, camera shot, and flash bulb would be different. Also, there was the issue of trying to balance the quality between scenes featuring dialogue and those involving boxing (which were done in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby" title="Dolby">Dolby</a>). <i>Raging Bull</i> went through a test screening in front of a small audience including the chief executives of United Artists, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Bach" title="Steven Bach">Steven Bach</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Albeck" title="Andy Albeck">Andy Albeck</a>. The screening was shown at the MGM screening room in New York around July 1980. Later, Albeck praised Scorsese by calling him a "true artist". According to the producer, Irwin Winkler, matters were made worse when United Artists decided not to distribute the film but no other studios were interested when they attempted to sell the rights. Scorsese made no secret that <i>Raging Bull</i> would be his "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> swan song" and he took unusual care of its rights during post-production. This caused some friction with Irwin Winkler, who accused Scorsese of doing the editing process "inch by inch". Scorsese threatened to remove his credit from the film if he was not allowed to sort a reel which obscured the name of a whisky brand known as "Cutty Sark" which was heard in a scene. The work was completed only four days shy of the premiere.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unsettling brew of violence and anger, combined with the lack of a proper advertising campaign, led to the film having a modest box office intake of $23 million. Scorsese became concerned for his future career and worried that producers and studios might refuse to finance his films. According to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Office_Mojo" title="Box Office Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a>, the film grossed $23,383,987 in domestic theaters.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Raging Bull</i> first premiered in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> on December 19, 1980 to mixed reviews. Jack Kroll of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> called Raging Bull "the best movie of the year" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Canby" title="Vincent Canby">Vincent Canby</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> said that Scorsese "has made his most ambitious film as well as his finest" and went on to praise Moriarty's debut performance as "either she is one of the film finds of the decade or Mr. Scorsese is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svengali" title="Svengali">Svengali</a>. Perhaps both." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> praised De Niro's performance since "much of <i>Raging Bull</i> exists because of the possibilities it offers De Niro to display his own explosive art". Steven Jenkins from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Film_Institute" title="British Film Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s (BFI) magazine, <i>Monthly Film Journal</i> said "<i>Raging Bull</i> may prove to be Scorsese's finest achievement to date". Many critics however were repelled by the film's violence and its unsympathetic central character. For example, Kathleen Carroll from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_News_(New_York)" title="Daily News (New York)">The New York Daily News</a></i> criticized the character of Jake LaMotta as "one of the most repugnant characters in the history of the movies"; she also faulted Scorsese because the movie "totally ignores [LaMotta's] reform school background, offering no explanation to his anti-social behavior".</p>
