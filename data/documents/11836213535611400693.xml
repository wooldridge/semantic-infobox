During the shooting, Leigh's name was first changed to 'Jeanette Reames', then to 'Janet Leigh' and finally back to her birth name 'Jeanette Morrison', because 'Janet Leigh' resembled <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> too much.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The success of <i>Psycho</i> jump-started Perkins' career, who soon began to suffer from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting_(acting)" title="Typecasting (acting)">typecasting</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Psycho</i> is based on the 1959 novel <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(novel)" title="Psycho (novel)">of the same name</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bloch" title="Robert Bloch">Robert Bloch</a> and based on the case of convicted serial killer Wisconsin <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein" title="Ed Gein">Ed Gein</a>. Peggy Robertson, a production assistant to Alfred Hitchcock, read <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Boucher" title="Anthony Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a>'s positive review of the novel and decided to show the novel to Hitchcock even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film. Hitchcock chose to film <i>Psycho</i> to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: <i>Flamingo Feather</i> and <i>No Bail for the Judge</i>. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Executives at Paramount did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio. The director decided to plan for <i>Psycho</i> to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents" title="Alfred Hitchcock Presents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a></i> and hired the TV series crew. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. But Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Harrison_(screenwriter)" title="Joan Harrison (screenwriter)">Joan Harrison</a> who did not think the film would be a success.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock acquired the film rights anonymously through an agent for $9,000.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">James Cavanaugh, who had written some of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents" title="Alfred Hitchcock Presents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a></i> television shows, wrote the original screenplay. Hitchcock rejected it, saying that the story dragged and read like a television short horror story. His assistant recalls that the treatment was very dull. Hitchcock reluctantly agreed to meet with Stefano, who had worked on only one film before. Despite his newness to the industry, the meeting went well, and Stefano was hired.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The screenplay is relatively faithful to the novel, with a few notable adaptations by Hitchcock and Stefano. Stefano found the character of Norman Bates (who, in the book, is middle-aged and more overtly unstable) unsympathetic, but became more intrigued when Hitchcock suggested the casting of youthful Anthony Perkins. Stefano eliminated Bates' drinking, which evidently necessitated removing Bates' switching to mother when in a drunken stupor. Also gone is Bates' interest in spiritualism and the occult. Hitchcock and Stefano elected to open the film with scenes in the life of Marion and not introduce Bates at all until 20 minutes into the film, rather than open with Bates reading a history book as Bloch does. Indeed, writer Joseph W. Smith notes that "Her story occupies only two of the novel's 17 chapters. Hitchcock and Stefano expanded this to nearly half the narrative". He likewise notes there is no hotel tryst between Marion and Sam in the novel. For Stefano, the conversation between Marion and Norman in the hotel parlor in which she displays a maternal sympathy towards him makes it possible for the audience to switch their sympathies towards Norman Bates after Marion's murder. When Lila Crane is looking through Norman's room, in the film she opens a book with a blank cover whose contents we do not see. In the novel these are "pathologically pornographic" illustrations. Stefano wanted to give the audience "indications that something was quite wrong, but it couldn't be spelled out or overdone." Francois Truffaut in his book of interviews with Hitchcock notes that the novel cheats by having extended conversations between Norman and "Mother" and stating what Mother is "doing" at various given moments. For obvious reasons, these are omitted from the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The name of the female protagonist was changed from Mary Crane to Marion Crane, since a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix. Also changed is the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila, now just a friendly relationship. Hitchcock preferred to focus audience's attention on the solution to the mystery rather than a budding romance and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap. Instead of having Sam explain to Lila Norman's mental condition the film simply has a psychotherapist do the talking. (Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother at the time of writing the film.) The novel is more violent than the film; for instance, Crane is beheaded in the shower, as opposed to being stabbed to death. Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect since toilets were virtually never seen on screen in the '60s. The location of Arbogast's death has been moved from the foyer to the stairwell. Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about "Mother" without tipping that something was being hidden. It also gives both his death (as well as Marion's) a dynamism not in the novel. As Janet Leigh put it, this gave Hitchcock more options for his camera.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Paramount, whose contract guaranteed another film by Hitchcock, did not want Hitchcock to make <i>Psycho</i>. Paramount was expecting <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unproduced_Hitchcock_projects#No_Bail_for_the_Judge_.281958.E2.80.931961.29" title="List of unproduced Hitchcock projects">No Bail for the Judge</a></i> starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>, who became pregnant and had to bow out, leading Hitchcock to scrap the production. Their official stance was that the book was "too repulsive" and "impossible for films", and nothing but another of his star-studded mystery thrillers. They did not like "anything about it at all" and denied him his usual budget. So, Hitchcock financed the film's creation through his own Shamley Productions, shooting at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a> under the Revue television unit. Hitchcock's original Bates Motel and Psycho House movie set buildings, which were constructed on the same stage as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_Chaney_Sr." title="Lon Chaney Sr.">Lon Chaney Sr.</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(1925_film)" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)"><i>The Phantom of the Opera</i></a>, are still standing at Universal Studios in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_City,_California" title="Universal City, California">Universal City</a> near <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> and are a regular attraction on the studio's tour. As a further result of cost cutting, Hitchcock chose to film <i>Psycho</i> in black and white, keeping the budget under $1,000,000. Other reasons for shooting in black and white were his desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory and his admiration for <i>Les Diaboliques'</i>s use of black and white.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To keep costs down and because he was most comfortable around them, Hitchcock took most of his crew from his television series <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i>, including the cinematographer, set designer, script supervisor, and first assistant director. He hired regular collaborators <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a> as music composer, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tomasini" title="George Tomasini">George Tomasini</a> as editor, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass" title="Saul Bass">Saul Bass</a> for the title design and storyboarding of the shower scene. In all, his crew cost $62,000.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through the strength of his reputation, Hitchcock cast Leigh for a quarter of her usual fee, paying only $25,000 (in the 1967 book <i>Hitchcock/Truffaut</i>, Hitchcock said that Leigh owed Paramount one final film on her seven-year contract which she had signed in 1953). His first choice, Leigh agreed after having only read the novel and making no inquiry into her salary. Her co-star, Anthony Perkins, agreed to $40,000. Both stars were experienced and proven box-office draws.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Paramount did distribute the film, but four years later Hitchcock sold his stock in Shamley to Universal's parent company and his next six films were made at and distributed by Universal. After another four years, Paramount sold all rights to Universal.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film, independently produced by Hitchcock, was shot at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revue_Studios" title="Revue Studios">Revue Studios</a>, the same location as his television show. <i>Psycho</i> was shot on a tight budget of $806,947.55, beginning on November 11, 1959 and ending on February 1, 1960. Filming started in the morning and finished by six or earlier on Thursdays (when Hitchcock and his wife would dine at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasen%27s" title="Chasen's">Chasen's</a>). Nearly the whole film was shot with 50Â mm lenses on 35Â mm cameras. This trick closely mimicked normal human vision, which helped to further involve the audience.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before shooting began in November, Hitchcock dispatched assistant director Hilton Green to Phoenix to scout locations and shoot the opening scene. The shot was supposed to be an aerial shot of Phoenix that slowly zoomed into the hotel window of a passionate Marion and Sam. Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio. Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between Fresno and Bakersfield, California for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix. They also provided the location shots for the scene where she is pulled over by the highway patrolman. In one street scene shot in downtown Phoenix, Christmas decorations were discovered to be visible; rather than re-shoot the footage, Hitchcock chose to add a graphic to the opening scene marking the date as "Friday, December the Eleventh".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Green also took photos of a prepared list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes such as those belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The look of the Bates Motel was modeled on Edward Hopper's famous painting <i>The House by The Railroad</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the leads, Perkins and Leigh, were given freedom to interpret their roles and improvise as long as it did not involve moving the camera. An example of Perkins' improvisation is Norman's habit of munching on candy corn. Throughout filming, Hitchcock created and hid various versions of the "Mother corpse" prop in Leigh's dressing room closet. Leigh took the joke well, and she wondered whether it was done to keep her on edge and thus more in character or to judge which corpse would be scarier for the audience.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying "Not inordinately" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_flare" title="Lens flare">lens flare</a>, which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Hitchcock, a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were directed by Hilton Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dailies" title="Dailies">dailies</a> of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were "no good" because they did not portray "an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs". Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic due to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist. A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chair-like device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hitchcock_cameo_appearances" title="List of Hitchcock cameo appearances">Alfred Hitchcock's cameo</a> is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In <i>Psycho</i>, he can be seen through a window, wearing a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stetson" title="Stetson">Stetson</a> hat, standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs says that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo so that he could be in a scene with his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance to avoid distracting the audience.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The murder of Janet Leigh's character in the shower is the film's pivotal scene, and one of the most famous scenes in cinema history. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. It was shot from December 17 to December 23, 1959, and features 77 different camera angles. The scene "runs 3 minutes and includes 50 cuts." Most of the shots are extreme close-ups, except for medium shots in the shower directly before and directly after the murder. The combination of the close shots with the short duration between cuts makes the sequence feel longer, more subjective, more uncontrolled, and more violent than would the images if they were presented alone or in a wider angle.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to capture the straight-on shot of the shower head, the camera had to be equipped with a long lens. The inner holes on the spout were blocked and the camera placed farther back, so that the water appears to be hitting the lens but actually went around and past it.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The soundtrack of screeching violins, violas, and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a> entitled "The Murder." Hitchcock originally wanted the sequence (and all motel scenes) to play without music, but Herrmann begged him to try it with the cue he had composed. Afterward, Hitchcock agreed that it vastly intensified the scene, and he nearly doubled Herrmann's salary. The blood in the scene is in fact <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_syrup" title="Chocolate syrup">chocolate syrup</a>, which shows up better on black-and-white film, and has more realistic density than stage blood. The sound of the knife entering flesh was created by plunging a knife into a melon.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is sometimes claimed that Leigh was not in the shower the entire time, and that a body double was used. However, in an interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, and in the book <i>Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho</i>, Leigh stated that she was in the scene the entire time; Hitchcock used a live model as her stand-in only for the scenes in which Norman wraps up Marion's body in a shower curtain and places her body in the trunk of her car. However, the 2010 book <i>The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock's Shower</i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Graysmith" title="Robert Graysmith">Robert Graysmith</a> contradicts this, identifying <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marli_Renfro" title="Marli Renfro">Marli Renfro</a> as Leigh's body double for some of the shower scenes.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another popular myth is that in order for Leigh's scream in the shower to sound realistic, Hitchcock used ice-cold water. Leigh denied this on numerous occasions, saying that he was very generous with a supply of hot water. Also, all of the screams are Leigh's.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another myth was that Hitchcock told Leigh only to stand in the shower, and she had no idea that her character was actually going to be murdered, causing an authentic reaction. The most notorious urban legend arising from the production of <i>Psycho</i> began when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass" title="Saul Bass">Saul Bass</a>, the graphic designer who created many of the title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of his scenes, claimed that he had actually directed the shower scene. This claim was refuted by several people associated with the film. Leigh, who is the focus of the scene, stated, "...absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've said it to his face in front of other people... I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera for every one of those seventy-odd shots." Hilton Green, the assistant director and cameraman, also denies Bass' claim: "There is not a shot in that movie that I didn't roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock's work, was also amused by the rumor, stating, "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, commentators such as Stephen Rebello and Bill Krohn have established that Saul Bass did contribute to the creation of that scene in his capacity as a graphic artist. Bass is credited for the design of the opening credits, and also as "Pictorial Consultant" in the credits. When interviewing Hitchcock, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" title="FranÃ§ois Truffaut">FranÃ§ois Truffaut</a> asked about the extent of Bass' contribution to the film, to which Hitchcock said that Bass designed the titles as well as provided storyboards for the Arbogast murder (which he claimed to have rejected), but made no mention of Bass providing storyboards for the shower scene. According to Bill Krohn's <i>Hitchcock At Work</i>, Bass's first claim to have directed the scene was in 1970, when he provided a magazine with 48 drawings used as storyboards as proof.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Krohn's analysis of the production of <i>Psycho</i> in his book <i>Hitchcock at Work</i>, while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final sceneâ€”most notably, the fact that the killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the shower curtain being torn down, the curtain rod being used as a barrier, and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes which (as Krohn notes) is highly reminiscent of the iris titles for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_(film)" title="Vertigo (film)">Vertigo</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Krohn's research also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Camera" title="Mitchell Camera">BNC Mitchell</a>, the other a handheld camera called an <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclair_(camera)" title="Eclair (camera)">Ã‰clair</a></i> which <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a> had used in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_of_Evil" title="Touch of Evil">Touch of Evil</a></i> (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moviola" title="Moviola">Moviola</a> on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tomasini" title="George Tomasini">George Tomasini</a> worked on with Hitchcock's advice, went far beyond the basic paradigms set up by Bass' storyboards.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Spoto" title="Donald Spoto">Donald Spoto</a> in <i>The Dark Side of Genius</i>, Hitchcock's wife, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_Reville" title="Alma Reville">Alma Reville</a>, spotted a blooper in one of the last screenings of <i>Psycho</i> before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. According to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Hitchcock" title="Patricia Hitchcock">Patricia Hitchcock</a>, talking in Laurent Bouzereau's "making of" documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences. Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contacts necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimatization to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is often claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the "shower scene" never once shows a knife puncturing flesh. However, a frame by frame analysis of the sequence clearly shows one shot in which the knife penetrates Leigh's abdomen; actually a prosthetic prop used for this shot. There is an alternate theory that the apparent piercing was created by lighting and reverse motion. Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all the doors and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open. She never realized until she first watched the film "how vulnerable and defenseless one is".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock insisted that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a> write the score for <i>Psycho</i>, in spite of the composer's refusal to accept a reduced fee for the film's lower budget. The resulting score, according to Christopher Palmer in <i>The Composer in Hollywood</i> (1990) is "perhaps Herrmann's most spectacular Hitchcock achievement." Hitchcock was pleased with the tension and drama the score added to the film, later remarking "33% of the effect of <i>Psycho</i> was due to the music." The singular contribution of Herrmann's score may be inferred from the film's credit roll, where the composer's name is preceded only by the director's own, a distinction unprecedented in the annals of commercial cinematic music. Herrmann used the lowered music budget to his advantage by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, disregarding Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. He thought of the single tone color of the all-string soundtrack as a way of reflecting the black and white cinematography of the film. Hollywood composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Steiner" title="Fred Steiner">Fred Steiner</a>, in an analysis of the score to <i>Psycho</i>, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main title music, a tense, contrapuntal piece, sets the tone of impending violence, and returns three times on the soundtrack. Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15â€“20 minutes of the film, the title music remains in the audience's mind, lending tension to these early scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film through the use of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato" title="Ostinato">ostinato</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were rumors that Herrmann had used electronic means, including amplified bird screeches to achieve the shocking effect of the music in the Shower Scene. The effect was achieved, however, only with violins in a "screeching, stabbing sound-motion of extraordinary viciousness." The only electronic amplification employed was in the placing of the microphones close to the instruments, to get a harsher sound. Besides the emotional impact, the Shower Scene cue ties the soundtrack to birds. The association of the Shower Scene music with birds also telegraphs to the audience that it is Norman, the stuffed-bird collector, who is the murderer rather than his mother.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herrmann biographer Steven C. Smith writes that the music for the Shower Scene is "probably the most famous (and most imitated) cue in film music," but Hitchock was originally opposed to having music in this scene. When Herrmann played the Shower Scene cue for Hitchcock, the director approved its use in the film. Herrmann reminded Hitchcock of his instructions not to score this scene, to which Hitchcock replied, "Improper suggestion, my boy, improper suggestion." This was one of two important disagreements Hitchcock had with Herrmann, in which Herrmann ignored Hitchcock's instructions. The second one, over the score for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torn_Curtain" title="Torn Curtain">Torn Curtain</a></i> (1966), resulted in the end of their professional collaboration. A survey conducted by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRS_for_Music" title="PRS for Music">PRS for Music</a>, in 2009, showed that the UK public consider the score from 'the shower scene' to be the scariest theme from any film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To honor the 50th anniversary of <i>Psycho</i>, in July 2010, the San Francisco Symphony obtained a print of the film with the soundtrack removed, and projected it on a large screen in Davies Symphony Hall while the orchestra performed the score live (November 19th 2010).</p>

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Controversy">Controversy</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the book <i>Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho</i>, the censors in charge of enforcing the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Motion_Picture_Production_Code_of_1930" title="United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930">Production Code</a> for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America" title="Motion Picture Association of America">MPAA</a> wrangled with Hitchcock because some censors insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Astoundingly, each of the censors reversed their positionsÂ â€“ those who had previously seen the breast now did not, and those who had not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another cause of concern for the censors was that Marion was shown flushing a toilet, with its contents (torn-up note paper) fully visible. Up until that time in mainstream film and television in the U.S., a toilet flushing was never heard, let alone seen. A possible exception is the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Classic_Movies" title="Turner Classic Movies">Turner Classic Movies</a> print of the 1959 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shaggy_Dog_(1959_film)" title="The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)">The Shaggy Dog</a></i>, in which a toilet is heard flushing off-camera. However, because of the possibility of audio dubbing in restorations and reissues of the film over the years, today it is unclear whether or not the sound of the toilet flushing was in the original 1959 release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also, according to the "Making of" featurette on the Collector's Edition DVD, some censors objected to the use of the word "transvestite" in the film's closing scenes. This objection was withdrawn after writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stefano" title="Joseph Stefano">Joseph Stefano</a> took out a dictionary and proved to them that the word carried no hidden sexual context, but merely referred to "a man who likes to wear women's clothing".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Internationally, Hitchcock was forced to make minor changes to the film, mostly to the shower scene. Notably, in Britain the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to and in Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast and a shot of Mother's corpse were removed.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Promotion">Promotion</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock did most of the promotion on his own, forbidding Leigh and Perkins from making the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of their revealing the plot. Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which, despite possibly affecting their reviews, certainly preserved the plot.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film's original trailer features a jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer on a tour of the set, and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is "tracked" with Bernard Herrmann's <i>Psycho</i> theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Harry" title="The Trouble with Harry">The Trouble with Harry</a></i>; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Vera Miles don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, "Psycho," instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most controversial move was Hitchcock's "no late admission" policy for the film, which was unusual for the time. It was not entirely original as Clouzot had done the same in France for <i>Les Diaboliques</i>. Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh, they would feel cheated. At first theater owners opposed the idea, claiming that they would lose business. However, after the first day, the owners enjoyed long lines of people waiting to see the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was so successful that it was reissued to theaters in 1965. A year later, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> purchased the television rights for $450,000. CBS planned to televise the film on September 23, 1966, but three days prior Valerie Percy, daughter of Illinois senate candidate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Percy" title="Charles H. Percy">Charles H. Percy</a>, was murdered. As her parents slept mere feet away, she was stabbed a dozen times with a double-edged knife. In light of the murder, CBS agreed to postpone the screening, but as a result of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1" title="Apollo 1">Apollo pad fire</a> of January 27, 1967, the network washed its hands of <i>Psycho</i>, and shortly afterward Paramount included the film in its first syndicated package of post-1950 movies, "Portfolio I." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WABC-TV" title="WABC-TV">WABC-TV</a> in New York City was the first station in the country to air <i>Psycho</i> (with some scenes significantly edited), on its late-night movie series, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Best_of_Broadway_(WABC-TV)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Best of Broadway (WABC-TV) (page does not exist)">The Best of Broadway</a></i>, on June 24, 1967. Following another successful theatrical reissue in 1969, the film finally made its way to general television airing in one of Universal's syndicated programming packages for local stations in 1970. <i>Psycho</i> was aired for twenty years in this format, then leased to cable for two years before returning to syndication as part of the "List of a Lifetime" package.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Interpretations">Interpretations</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>Psycho</i>, Hitchcock subverts the romantic elements that are seen in most of his work. The film is instead ironic as it prevents "clarity and fulfillment" of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters "struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories" and ultimately fail. Lesley Brill writes, "The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness." The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film. Marion is like <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone" title="Persephone">Persephone</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, who is abducted temporarily from the world of living. The myth does not sustain with Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone's flowers, but they are only "reflected in mirrors, as images of imagesâ€”twice removed from reality". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion's lifeless eye, "Like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Dolce_Vita" title="La Dolce Vita">La Dolce Vita</a></i>, it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption." Unlike heroines in Hitchcock's other films, she does not reestablish her innocence or discover love.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marion is deprived of "the humble treasures of love, marriage, home, and family", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among <i>Psycho</i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s secondary characters a lack of "familial warmth and stability", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an "increasingly connubial" relationship, a development that Marion is denied. Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has "an infantile and divided personality" and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are "frozen in time" and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put his mother "someplace" and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains, "'Someplace' for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Light and darkness feature prominently in <i>Psycho</i>. The first shot after the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertitle" title="Intertitle">intertitle</a> is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at Bates Motel in near darkness. Bright lights are also "the ironic equivalent of darkness" in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at Bates Motel, "the glaring white" of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the very first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the very end. More subtly, back-lighting turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as foreshadowing of the shower, and it letting up can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a number of references to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman's hobby is stuffing birds, and he comments that Marion eats like a bird.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Psycho</i> has been called "the first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalytical</a> thriller." The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. "[T]he shower scene is both feared and desired," wrote French film critic Serge Kaganski. "Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists, since Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his documentary <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pervert%27s_Guide_to_Cinema" title="The Pervert's Guide to Cinema">The Pervert's Guide to Cinema</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek" title="Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek">Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek</a> remarks that Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, parallelling the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego,_and_super-ego" title="Id, ego, and super-ego">three levels</a> that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> attributes to the human mind: the top floor would be the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superego" title="Superego">superego</a></i>, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego" title="Ego">ego</a></i>, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego,_and_super-ego" title="Id, ego, and super-ego">id</a></i>. Å½iÅ¾ek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initial reviews of the film were thoroughly mixed. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> wrote, "There is not an abundance of subtlety or the lately familiar Hitchcock bent toward significant and colorful scenery in this obviously low-budget job." Crowther called the "slow buildups to sudden shocks" reliably melodramatic but contested Hitchcock's psychological points, reminiscent of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Krafft-Ebing" title="Richard von Krafft-Ebing">Krafft-Ebing</a>'s studies, as less effective. While the film did not conclude satisfactorily for the critic, he commended the cast's performances as "fair". British writer C. A. Lejeune was so offended that she not only walked out before the end but permanently resigned her post as film critic for the <i>Observer</i>. Other negative reviews stated, "a blot on an honorable career", "plainly a gimmick movie", and "merely one of those television shows padded out to two hours." Positive reviews stated, "Anthony Perkins' performance is the best of his career... Janet Leigh has never been better", "played out beautifully", and "first American movie since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_of_Evil" title="Touch of Evil">Touch of Evil</a></i> to stand in the same creative rank as the great European films." A good example of the mix is the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Herald_Tribune" title="New York Herald Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a></i>'s review, which stated, "...rather difficult to be amused at the forms insanity may take... keeps your attention like a snake-charmer."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The public loved the film, with lines stretching outside of theaters as people had to wait for the next showing. It broke box-office records in Japan, China and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period. It is one of the largest-grossing black-and-white films and helped make Hitchcock a multimillionaire and the third-largest shareholder in Universal. <i>Psycho</i> was, by a large margin, the top moneymaking film of Hitchcock's career, earning $11,200,000.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Great Britain, the film shattered attendance records at the London Plaza Cinema, but nearly all British critics panned it, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment. Reasons cited for this were the critics' late screenings, forcing them to rush their reviews, their dislike of the gimmicky promotion, and Hitchcock's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate" title="Expatriate">expatriate</a> status. Perhaps thanks to the public's response and Hitchcock's efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_magazine" title="Time magazine"><i>Time</i> magazine</a> switched its opinion from "Hitchcock bears down too heavily in this one" to "superlative" and "masterly", and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> put it on his Top Ten list of 1960.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Psycho</i> has become one of the most recognizable films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock's best known film. In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most original and influential moment in the film is the "shower scene", which became iconic in pop culture because it is often regarded as one of the most terrifying scenes ever filmed. Part of its effectiveness was due to the use of startling editing techniques borrowed from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_montage_theory" title="Soviet montage theory">Soviet montage</a> filmmakers, and to the iconic screeching violins in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>'s musical score. The iconic shower scene is frequently spoofed, given homage to and referenced in popular culture, complete with the violin screeching sound effects (see <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_(film)" title="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></i>, among many others).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Psycho</i> is a prime example of the type of film that appeared in the 1960s after the erosion of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Motion_Picture_Production_Code_of_1930" title="United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930">Production Code</a>. It was unprecedented in its depiction of sexuality and violence, right from the opening scene where Sam and Marion are shown as lovers sharing the same bed, with Marion in a bra. In the Production Code standards of that time, unmarried couples shown in the same bed would be taboo. In addition, the censors were upset by the shot of a flushing toilet; at that time, the idea of seeing a toilet onscreenâ€”let alone being flushedâ€”was taboo in American films and television shows. According to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>, "The Production Code censors... had no objection to the bloodletting, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus" title="Oedipus">Oedipal</a> murder theme, or even the shower sceneâ€”but did ask that Hitchcock remove the word <i>transvestite</i> from the film. He didn't."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Psycho</i> is now widely considered to be the first film in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slasher_film" title="Slasher film">slasher film</a> genre, and has been referenced in films numerous times; examples include the 1978 horror film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_(1978_film)" title="Halloween (1978 film)">Halloween</a></i>, the 1977 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Anxiety" title="High Anxiety">High Anxiety</a></i>, the 1980 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fade_to_Black_(1980_film)" title="Fade to Black (1980 film)">Fade to Black</a></i>, the 1980 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressed_to_Kill_(1980_film)" title="Dressed to Kill (1980 film)">Dressed to Kill</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Craven" title="Wes Craven">Wes Craven's</a> 1997 horror satire <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_2" title="Scream 2">Scream 2</a></i>, and the 2003 live-action/animated <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes:_Back_in_Action" title="Looney Tunes: Back in Action">Looney Tunes: Back in Action</a>.</i> Bernard Herrmann's opening theme has been sampled by rapper <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busta_Rhymes" title="Busta Rhymes">Busta Rhymes</a> on his song "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimme_Some_More" title="Gimme Some More">Gimme Some More</a>".</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ratings">Ratings</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Psycho</i> has been rated and re-rated several times over the years by the MPAA. Upon its initial release, the film received a certificate stating that it was "Approved" (certificate #19564) under the simple pass/fail system of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motion_Picture_Production_Code&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="United States Motion Picture Production Code (page does not exist)">Production Code</a> in use at that time. Later, when the MPAA switched to a voluntary letter ratings system in 1968, <i>Psycho</i> was one of a number of high-profile motion pictures to be retro-rated with an "M" (Mature Audiences). This remained the only rating the film would receive for 16 years, and according to the guidelines of the time "M" was the equivalent of a "PG" rating. Then, in 1984, during the uproar of increased parental concern regarding violence in "PG" movies, <i>Psycho</i> was retro-rated again to its current rating of "R." This rating took effect, however, before the institution of the "PG-13" rating by the MPAA that same year, and there are those who have speculated that if the rating had existed at the time, or if <i>Psycho</i> were rated in America today, it would receive a "PG-13." In any case, the IMDB entry for <i>Psycho</i>, as referenced through the Classification &amp; Rating Administration's (CARA's) Website, does not recommend that anyone under 12 view the movie.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film has been released several times on videotape, LaserDisc, and DVD. MCA DiscoVision Incorporated (parent company, MCA Inc) first released <i>Psycho</i> on the LaserDisc format in "standard play" (5 sides) in 1979, and "extended play" (2 sides) in October 1981. MCA/Universal Home Video released a new LaserDisc version of <i>Psycho</i> in August 1988 (Catalog #: 11003). In May 1998 Universal Studios Home Video released a deluxe edition of <i>Psycho</i> as part of their Signature Collection. This THXÂ® certified Widescreen (1.85:1) LaserDisc Deluxe Edition (Catalog #: 43105) is spread across 4 extended play sides and 1 standard play side, and includes a new documentary and isolated Bernard Hermann score. A DVD edition was released in at the same time as the LaserDisc.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laurent Bouzereau produced a documentary looking at the film's production and reception for the initial DVD release. Universal released a 50th Anniversary edition on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-Ray" title="Blu-Ray">Blu-Ray</a> in the United Kingdom on 9 August 2010, with Australia following with the same edition (featuring a different cover) being made available on the 1st of September 2010.
