      <wiki:abstract>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Steven Allan Spielberg</b> (born December 18, 1946) is an American film director, screenwriter, film producer, video game designer and studio executive. In a career spanning four decades, Spielberg's films have covered many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as an archetype of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing such issues as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, slavery, war and terrorism. He is considered one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. He is also one of the founders of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks" title="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> movie studio.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Academy Award for Best Director</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i> (1993) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" title="Saving Private Ryan">Saving Private Ryan</a></i> (1998). Three of Spielberg's films; <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i> (1975), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i> (1982), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i> (1993), achieved <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" title="List of highest-grossing films">box office</a> records, each becoming the highest-grossing film made at the time. To date, the unadjusted gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $8.5Â billion worldwide. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes</a> puts Spielberg's wealth at $3.0Â billion.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio, to a Jewish family. His mother Leah Adler was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and father Arnold Spielberg was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. He spent his childhood in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haddon_Heights,_New_Jersey" title="Haddon Heights, New Jersey">Haddon Heights, New Jersey</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsdale,_Arizona" title="Scottsdale, Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>. Throughout his early teens, Spielberg made amateur 8Â mm "adventure" films with his friends, the first of which he shot at the Pinnacle Peak Patio restaurant in Scottsdale. He charged admission (25 cents) to his home films (which involved the wrecks he staged with his Lionel train set) while his sister sold popcorn.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1958, he became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouting_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)">Boy Scout</a>, and fulfilled a requirement for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merit_badge_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)">photography merit badge</a> by making a nine-minute 8Â mm film entitled <i>The Last Gunfight</i>. Spielberg recalled years later to a magazine interviewer, "My dad's still-camera was broken, so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father's movie camera. He said yes, and I got an idea to do a Western. I made it and got my merit badge. That was how it all started." At age 13, Spielberg won a prize for a 40-minute war film he titled <i>Escape to Nowhere</i> which was based on a battle in east Africa. In 1963, at age 16, Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firelight_(1964_film)" title="Firelight (1964 film)">Firelight</a></i> (which would later inspire <i>Close Encounters</i>). The film, which had a budget of US$500, was shown in his local cinema and generated a profit of $100. He also made several WWII films inspired by his father's war stories.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After his parents divorced, he moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga,_California" title="Saratoga, California">Saratoga, California</a> with his father. His three sisters and mother remained in Arizona, where he attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder" title="Passover Seder">Passover Seders</a> at the home of Zalman and Pearl Segal on an annual basis. Although he attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_High_School_(Phoenix,_Arizona)" title="Arcadia High School (Phoenix, Arizona)">Arcadia High School</a> in Phoenix, Arizona for three years, Spielberg ended up graduating from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_High_School" title="Saratoga High School">Saratoga High School</a> in 1965. It was during this time Spielberg attained the rank of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)">Eagle Scout</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg attended synagogue as a young boy in Haddon Heights, NJ, an area which did not allow Jews before World War II. He attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_L._Lewis" title="Albert L. Lewis">Albert L. Lewis</a>, who would later be memorialized as the main character in Mitch Albom's, <i>Have a Little Faith</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a child, Spielberg has faced difficulty assimilating. â€œIt isnâ€™t something I enjoy admitting,â€&#157; he once said, â€œbut when I was 7, 8, 9 years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parentsâ€™ Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times. My grandfather always wore a long black coat, black hat and long white beard. I was embarrassed to invite my friends over to the house, because he might be in a corner davening [praying], and I wouldnâ€™t know how to explain this to my WASP friends.â€&#157; Spielberg also said he suffered from acts of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Semitic" title="Anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> prejudice in his early life: he later said, "In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After moving to California, he applied to attend the film school at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a> School of Theater, Film and Television three separate times, but was unsuccessful. He was a student subsequently of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University,_Long_Beach" title="California State University, Long Beach">California State University, Long Beach</a>. While attending Long Beach State in the 1960s, Spielberg became member of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_Chi_Fraternity" title="Theta Chi Fraternity">Theta Chi Fraternity</a>. His actual career began when he returned to Universal Studios as an unpaid, seven-day-a-week intern and guest of the editing department. After Spielberg became famous, USC awarded him an honorary degree in 1994, and in 1996 he became a trustee of the university. In 2002, thirty-five years after starting college, Spielberg finished his degree via independent projects at CSULB, and was awarded a B.A. in Film Production and Electronic Arts with an option in Film/Video Production.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an intern and guest of Universal Studios, Spielberg made his first short film for theatrical release, the 24 minute film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblin%27" title="Amblin'">Amblin'</a></i> (1968), the title of which Spielberg later took as the name of his production company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblin_Entertainment" title="Amblin Entertainment">Amblin Entertainment</a>. After Sidney Sheinberg, then the vice-president of production for Universal's TV arm, saw the film, Spielberg became the youngest director ever to be signed for a long-term deal with a major Hollywood studio (Universal). He dropped out of Long Beach State in 1969 to take up the television director contract at Universal Studios and began his career as a professional director. In 1969, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> announced that Spielberg would direct his first full length film, <i>Malcolm Winkler</i>, written by Claudia Salter, produced by John Orland, with Frank Price being the executive producer. However, because of the difficulty in casting the key male role, the film was not made. Steven Spielberg attended Brookdale Community College for undergrad.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His first professional TV job came when he was hired to do one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Gallery" title="Night Gallery">Night Gallery</a></i>. The segment, "Eyes," starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a>, and she and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death. The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more "mature" films. After this, and an episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Welby,_M.D." title="Marcus Welby, M.D.">Marcus Welby, M.D.</a></i>, Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Game_(TV_series)" title="The Name of the Game (TV series)">The Name of the Game</a></i> called "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._2017" title="L.A. 2017">L.A. 2017</a>". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on <i>Night Gallery</i> and did some work for shows such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Marshall:_Counselor_at_Law" title="Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law">Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law</a></i> and <i>The Psychiatrist</i> before landing the first series episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo_(TV_series)" title="Columbo (TV series)">Columbo</a></i> (previous episodes were actually TV films).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Matheson" title="Richard Matheson">Richard Matheson</a> adaptation called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel_(1971_film)" title="Duel (1971 film)">Duel</a></i>. The film is about a psychotic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterbilt_281" title="Peterbilt 281">Peterbilt 281</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_truck" title="Tanker truck">tanker truck</a> driver who chases a terrified driver (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Weaver" title="Dennis Weaver">Dennis Weaver</a>) of a small <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Valiant" title="Plymouth Valiant">Plymouth Valiant</a> and tries to run him off the road. <i>Duel</i> was his first feature film and major hit when it was released into theaters. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilys_Powell" title="Dilys Powell">Dilys Powell</a> was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Evil" title="Something Evil">Something Evil</a></i>) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(film)" title="The Exorcist (film)">The Exorcist</a></i>, then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film length pilot of a show called <i>Savage</i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Landau" title="Martin Landau">Martin Landau</a>. Spielberg's debut theatrical feature film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sugarland_Express" title="The Sugarland Express">The Sugarland Express</a></i>, about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> stated that "a major new director is on the horizon." However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studio producers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_D._Zanuck" title="Richard D. Zanuck">Richard D. Zanuck</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brown_(producer)" title="David Brown (producer)">David Brown</a> offered Spielberg the director's chair for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i>, a thriller-horror film based on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Benchley" title="Peter Benchley">Peter Benchley</a> novel about an enormous killer shark. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three <b>Academy Awards</b> (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing $470,653,000 worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as "Jawsmania." <i>Jaws</i> made him a household name, as well as one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, and allowed Spielberg a great deal of autonomy for his future projects. It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss" title="Richard Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rejecting offers to direct <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_2" title="Jaws 2">Jaws 2</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(1976_film)" title="King Kong (1976 film)">King Kong</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(film)" title="Superman (film)">Superman</a></i>, Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object" title="Unidentified flying object">UFOs</a>, which became <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i> (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, <i>Close Encounters</i> was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilmos_Zsigmond" title="Vilmos Zsigmond">Vilmos Zsigmond</a>, and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941_(film)" title="1941 (film)">1941</a></i>, a big-budgeted World War II farce wasn't nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4Â million dollars worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics. It has since become a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film" title="Cult film">cult classic</a> thanks to television showings and home video releases.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg then revisited his <i>Close Encounters</i> project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released <i>Close Encounters: The Special Edition</i> in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, Spielberg teamed with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> creator and friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> on an action adventure film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark" title="Raiders of the Lost Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></i>, the first of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a> (whom Lucas had previously cast in his <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> films as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>). The film was considered a homage to the cliffhanger serials of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Hollywood" title="Golden Age of Hollywood">Golden Age of Hollywood</a>. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). <i>Raiders</i> is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i>. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his people and is trying to get back home. <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> went on to become the top-grossing film of all time. <i>E.T.</i> was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 1982 and 1985, Spielberg produced three high-grossing films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist_(film)" title="Poltergeist (film)">Poltergeist</a></i> (for which he also co-wrote the screenplay), a big-screen adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone:_The_Movie" title="Twilight Zone: The Movie">The Twilight Zone</a></i> (for which he directed the segment "Kick The Can"), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies" title="The Goonies">The Goonies</a></i> (Spielberg, executive producer, also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His next directorial feature was the <i>Raiders</i> sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom" title="Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></i>. Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins" title="Gremlins">Gremlins</a></i> led to the creation of the PG-13 rating due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, <i>Temple of Doom</i> is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg's films often deal with several recurring themes. Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. In an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">AFI</a> interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extra terrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood, and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A strong consistent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)" title="Theme (literature)">theme</a> in his family-friendly work is a childlike, even naÃ¯ve, sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)" title="Hook (film)"><i>Hook</i></a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence" title="A.I. Artificial Intelligence">A.I. Artificial Intelligence</a></i>. According to Warren Buckland, these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (<i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Sun_(film)" title="Empire of the Sun (film)">Empire of the Sun</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i>, etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_(film)" title="Munich (film)">Munich</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" title="Saving Private Ryan">Saving Private Ryan</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminal" title="The Terminal">The Terminal</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)" title="Minority Report (film)">Minority Report</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amistad_(1997_film)" title="Amistad (1997 film)">Amistad</a></i>. If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in <i>Jaws</i> are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In <i>Empire of the Sun</i>, Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can" title="Catch Me If You Can">Catch Me If You Can</a></i> Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in <i>Hook</i> starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of his film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in <i>E.T.</i>, is the most famous example of this theme. In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade" title="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></i>, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son "self reliance," which is not how Indy saw it). Even <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler" title="Oskar Schindler">Oskar Schindler</a>, from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i>, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a></i> depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i> is a committed family man, while John Anderton in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)" title="Minority Report (film)">Minority Report</a></i> is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can" title="Catch Me If You Can">Catch Me If You Can</a></i> (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i> (early in the film another, secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Critics frequently accuse his films of being overly sentimental, though Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised. The influence comes from directors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank Capra</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of casting and production itself, Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films. For instance he has cast Richard Dreyfuss in several films: <i>Jaws</i>, <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>, and <i>Always</i>. Aside from his role as Indiana Jones, Spielberg also cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a> as a headteacher in <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> (though the scene was ultimately cut). Although Spielberg directed him only once (in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for which he voiced many of the animals), veteran voice actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Welker" title="Frank Welker">Frank Welker</a> has lent his voice in a number of productions Spielberg has executively produced from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins" title="Gremlins">Gremlins</a></i> to its sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins_2:_The_New_Batch" title="Gremlins 2: The New Batch">Gremlins 2: The New Batch</a></i>, as well as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_Before_Time" title="The Land Before Time">The Land Before Time</a></i> (and lending his voice to its sequels which Spielberg had no involvement in), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit" title="Who Framed Roger Rabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></i>, and television shows such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Toon_Adventures" title="Tiny Toon Adventures">Tiny Toons</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaniacs" title="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></i>, and SeaQuest DSV. Recently Spielberg has used Tom Hanks on several occasions and has cast him in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, <i>Catch Me If You Can</i>, and <i>The Terminal</i>. Spielberg also has collaborated with Tom Cruise twice on <i>Minority Report</i> and <i>War of the Worlds</i>. Spielberg has also cast Shia LaBeouf in four films: <i>Transformers</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Eye" title="Eagle Eye">Eagle Eye</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull" title="Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Revenge_of_the_Fallen" title="Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></i>. Spielberg prefers working with production members with whom he has developed an existing working relationship.

Most of the DVDs of Spielberg's films have documentaries by Laurent Bouzereau.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A famous example of Spielberg working with the same professionals is his long time collaboration with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a> and the use of his musical scores in all of his films since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sugarland_Express" title="The Sugarland Express">The Sugarland Express</a></i> (except <i>The Color Purple</i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone:_The_Movie" title="Twilight Zone: The Movie">Twilight Zone: The Movie</a></i>). One of Spielberg's trademarks is his use of music by John Williams to add to the visual impact of his scenes and to try and create a lasting picture and sound of the film in the memories of the film audience. These visual scenes often uses images of the sun (e.g. <i>Empire of the Sun</i>, <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, the final scene of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i>, and the end credits of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade" title="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></i> (where they ride into the sunset), of which the last two feature a Williams score at that end scene.

The second part of the movie, which depicts the Israeli government's response, has been debated a great deal by film critics and newspaper columnists.

After the killings, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israeli</a> government devises "an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye" title="Eye for an eye">eye for an eye</a>" retaliation. A target list of 11 names is drawn up in retaliation for the 11 Israeli men murdered.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avner Kaufman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bana" title="Eric Bana">Eric Bana</a>), an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_(person)" title="Sabra (person)">Israeli-born</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad" title="Mossad">Mossad</a> agent of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Jews" title="German Jews">German descent</a>, is chosen to lead the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination" title="Assassination">assassination</a> squad. To give the Israeli government <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability" title="Plausible deniability">plausible deniability</a>, Avner officially resigns from Mossad, and the squad operates with no official ties to Israel. Avner is given a team of four men: Steve (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Craig" title="Daniel Craig">Daniel Craig</a>), a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African" title="South African">South African</a> driver; Hans (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Zischler" title="Hanns Zischler">Hanns Zischler</a>), a document forger; Robert (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_Kassovitz" title="Mathieu Kassovitz">Mathieu Kassovitz</a>), a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian" title="Belgian">Belgian</a> toy-maker trained in defusing explosives; and Carl (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciar%C3%A1n_Hinds" title="CiarÃ¡n Hinds">CiarÃ¡n Hinds</a>), a former Israeli soldier who "cleans up" after the assassinations.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The group go to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> to track down and shoot their first target, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Wael_Zwaiter" title="Abdel Wael Zwaiter">Abdel Wael Zwaiter</a>, who is broke and living as a poet. The group follows him, from a speech he gave to a small audience, to his apartment building. After confirming the poet is indeed Abdel Wael Zwaiter (by asking him), Avner &amp; Robert make their first kill. Robert pretends to be a journalist interviewing their second target, Mahmoud Hamshari, about Munich. He plants a bomb in the phone that is set to be detonated by a remote key. The phone number of Hamshari is to be dialed by Carl from a public telephone booth. Carl calls the number, asks the man who answers if he's Hamshari and upon affirmation of same, Robert detonates the bomb. The team travel to Cyprus to kill the next target, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hussein_Al_Bashir_(Hussein_Abd_Al_Chir)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Hussein Al Bashir (Hussein Abd Al Chir) (page does not exist)">Hussein Al Bashir (Hussein Abd Al Chir)</a>, by planting a bomb in his hotel room. Avner gets a room next to Al Chir. When Robert detonates the bomb the explosives are too powerful, almost killing Avner in the room next door.</p>

Ephraim, the team's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_handling" title="Agent handling">handler</a>, refuses to let them handle the mission themselves. Avner insists that he will lose Louis's trust if the operation is carried out by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Defense_Forces" title="Israeli Defense Forces">Israeli Defense Forces</a>. Ephraim relents, allowing the team to accompany the IDF commandos. In Beirut, Steve, Robert and Avner meet up with a group of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayeret_Matkal" title="Sayeret Matkal">Sayeret Matkal</a> IDF soldiers. They penetrate the Palestinian leaders' guarded compound, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Israeli_raid_on_Lebanon" title="1973 Israeli raid on Lebanon">killing all three leaders</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The team heads to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a> where Louis has provided a dingy apartment. During the night, four <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization" title="Palestine Liberation Organization">PLO</a> members, who have rented the same apartment as a safe house, enter the dwelling. After a tense confrontation with guns drawn, Robert defuses the situation by claiming that his squad are fellow militant revolutionaries, members of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA" title="ETA">ETA</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction" title="Red Army Faction">RAF</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" title="African National Congress">ANC</a>. Avner discusses <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern" title="Middle Eastern">Middle Eastern</a> politics with the group's leader. Avner's group carry out their next assassination, that of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zaiad_Muchasi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Zaiad Muchasi (page does not exist)">Zaiad Muchasi</a>. They install a remote-controlled bomb in Muchasi's TV set. However, the bomb does not detonate. Hans walks into the hotel, forces his way and throws a grenade that sets off the bomb, killing Muchasi. The squad exchanges gunfire with Muchasi's bodyguards.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Louis provides the squad with information on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Hassan_Salameh" title="Ali Hassan Salameh">Ali Hassan Salameh</a>, the organizer of the Munich Massacre. Avner learns from Louis that the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> have a deal with Salameh wherein they protect and fund him in exchange for his promise not to attack US diplomats. The squad moves to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> to track down Salameh, but they are not able to accomplish the assassination when Avner is suddenly approached by several drunken Americans. It is implied the said Americans are actually CIA agents. Avner is propositioned by a woman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Jos%C3%A9e_Croze" title="Marie-JosÃ©e Croze">Marie-JosÃ©e Croze</a>) in the hotel but declines. Afterward, Carl is killed by the same woman, an independent Dutch contract killer.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie then proceeds on more dark and sombre lines. The squad is feeling the pressure of the assassinations. Robert questions the morality of the entire mission. Avner listens to him and asks him to take a break. The remaining squad track the Dutch assassin to Holland. Later, Avner, Steve and Hans discuss the futility of the mission. Later, Hans is found stabbed to death and left on a park bench while Robert is killed in an explosion in his workshop. Avner and Steve finally locate Salameh in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>; however, their assassination attempt is thwarted by Salameh's guards.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the final scene, Avner openly questions the basis and effectiveness of the operation, and Ephraim admits that there isn't evidence linking all targets to Munich. Avner asks Ephraim â€“ as a fellow Jew â€“ to break bread with him, but Ephraim rejects him and leaves. As Avner turns and leave as well, the camera pans to a shot of the New York skyline, centering on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center" title="World Trade Center">World Trade Center</a> towers.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reaction">Critical reaction</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film garnered a 78% favorable rating from critics (per <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>), though its "Top Critics" rating was lower at 61%. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> praised the film, saying that "With this film (Spielberg) has dramatically opened a wider dialogue, helping to make the inarguable into the debatable."  and placed it at #3 on his top ten list of 2005. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Berardinelli" title="James Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> wrote that "Munich is an eye-opener - a motion picture that asks difficult questions, presents well-developed characters, and keeps us white-knuckled throughout." He named it the best film of the year; it was the only movie in 2005 which he gave four stars, and he also put it on his Top 100 Films of All Time list. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> movie critic Owen Gleiberman said that <i>Munich</i> was the #1 film of 2005. Rex Reed from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Observer" title="New York Observer">New York Observer</a></i> belongs to the group of critics who didn't like the movie: "With no heart, no ideology and not much intellectual debate, Munich is a big disappointment, and something of a bore."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Variety</i> magazine reviewer Todd McCarthy called <i>Munich</i> a "beautifully made" film. He criticized the film for failing to include "compelling" characters, and for its use of laborious plotting and a "flabby script." McCarthy says that the film turns into "...a lumpy and overlong morality play on a failed thriller template." To succeed, McCarthy states that Spielberg would have needed to implicate the viewer in the assassin squad leader's growing crisis of conscience and create a more "sustain(ed) intellectual interest" for the viewer.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Chicago Tribune</i> reviewer Allison Benedikt calls <i>Munich</i> a "competent thriller", but laments that as an "intellectual pursuit, it is little more than a pretty prism through which superficial Jewish guilt and generalized Palestinian nationalism" are made to "... look like the product of serious soul-searching." Benedikt states that Spielberg's treatment of the film's "dense and complicated" subject matter can be summed up as "Palestinians want a homeland, Israelis have to protect theirs." She rhetorically asks: "Do we need another handsome, well-assembled, entertaining movie to prove that we all bleed red?"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another critique was Gabriel Schoenfeld's "Spielberg's 'Munich'" in the February 2006 issue of conservative <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentary_(magazine)" title="Commentary (magazine)">Commentary</a></i>, who called it "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pernicious" title="wiktionary:pernicious">pernicious</a>". He compared the fictional film to history, asserted that Spielberg and especially Kushner felt that the Palestinian terrorists and the Mossad agents are morally equivalent and concluded: "The movie deserves an Oscar in one category only: most hypocritical film of the year."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Writing in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(magazine)" title="Empire (magazine)">Empire</a></i>, Ian Nathan wrote that "<i>Munich</i> is Steven Spielbergâ€™s most difficult film. It arrives already inflamed by controversy... This is Spielberg operating at his peak â€” an exceptionally made, provocative and vital film for our times."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stephen Howe in his openDemocracy review points out: "Also obviously intended to shock, and to prompt reflection, is a penultimate scene where shots of Avner making love are intercut with the climactic slaughter at Munich. It's another weary clichÃ©: rough sex and violent death yoked together in some unthought-about, sub-Freudian way. And if, as one supposes, the Munich scenes are supposed to be running through Avner's head, we're offered no reason why he should be so haunted. He wasn't there. Those scenes weren't even on TV. Why not any of the equally vicious incidents he's witnessed, or perpetrated, himself?"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film received five <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nominations, including the Best Picture, but did not win any awards.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some reviewers have criticized <i>Munich</i> for what they call the film's equating the Israeli assassins with "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorists" title="Terrorists">terrorists</a>". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Wieseltier" title="Leon Wieseltier">Leon Wieseltier</a> wrote in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic" title="The New Republic">The New Republic</a></i>, "... Worse, 'Munich' prefers a discussion of counter-terrorism to a discussion of terrorism; or it thinks that they are the same discussion".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Melman and other critics of the book and the film have said that the story's premiseâ€”that Israeli agents had second thoughts about their workâ€”is not supported by interviews or public statements. A retired head of Israel's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet" title="Shin Bet">Shin Bet</a> intelligence service, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Dichter" title="Avi Dichter">Avi Dichter</a>, currently the Internal Security Minister, likened <i>Munich</i> to a children's adventure story: "There is no comparison between what you see in the movie and how it works in reality," he said in an interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters" title="Reuters">Reuters</a>. In a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Magazine" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a></i> cover story about the film on December 4, 2005, Spielberg said that the source of the film had second thoughts about his actions. "There is something about killing people at close range that is excruciating," Spielberg said. "It's bound to try a man's soul." Of the real Avner, Spielberg says, "I donâ€™t think he will ever find peace."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Organization_of_America" title="Zionist Organization of America">Zionist Organization of America</a> (ZOA), describing itself as "the oldest, and one of the largest, pro-Israel and Zionist organizations in the United States", called for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott" title="Boycott">boycott</a> of the film on December 27, 2005. The ZOA criticized the factual basis of the film, and leveled criticism at one of the screenwriters, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kushner" title="Tony Kushner">Tony Kushner</a>, who the ZOA has described as an "Israel-hater".

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Edelstein" title="David Edelstein">David Edelstein</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate</a></i> argued that "The Israeli government and many conservative and pro-Israeli commentators have lambasted the film for naivetÃ©, for implying that governments should never retaliate. But an expression of uncertainty and disgust is not the same as one of outright denunciation. What <i>Munich</i> does say is that this shortsighted tit-for-tat can produce a kind of insanity, both individual and collective."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Illano Romano, wife of an Israeli weightlifter slain in the Munich massacre, pointed out that Spielberg overlooked the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillehammer_affair" title="Lillehammer affair">Lillehammer affair</a>, although Spielberg seems to have been conscious of the omission; the film's opening title frame shows <i>Lillehammer</i> in a montage of city names, with <i>Munich</i> standing out from the rest.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_authenticity">Historical authenticity</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although <i>Munich</i> is a work of fiction, it describes many actual events and figures from the early 1970s. On the Israeli side, Prime Minister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir" title="Golda Meir">Golda Meir</a> is depicted in the film, and other military and political leaders such as Attorney General <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Shamgar" title="Meir Shamgar">Meir Shamgar</a>, Mossad chief <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Zamir" title="Zvi Zamir">Zvi Zamir</a> and Aman chief <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_Yariv" title="Aharon Yariv">Aharon Yariv</a> are also depicted. Spielberg tried to make the depiction of the hostage-taking and killing of the Israeli athletes historically authentic. Unlike an earlier film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=21_Hours_at_Munich&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="21 Hours at Munich (page does not exist)">21 Hours at Munich</a></i>, Spielberg's film depicts the shooting of <i>all</i> the Israeli athletes, which according to the autopsies was accurate. In addition, the film uses actual news clips shot during the hostage situation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The named members of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_(group)" title="Black September (group)">Black September</a>, and their deaths, are also mostly factual. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Wael_Zwaiter" title="Abdel Wael Zwaiter">Abdel Wael Zwaiter</a>, a translator at the Libyan embassy in Rome, was shot 11 times, one bullet for each of the victims of the Munich Massacre, in the lobby of his apartment 41 days after Munich. On December 8 of that year <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmoud_Hamshiri&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Mahmoud Hamshiri (page does not exist)">Mahmoud Hamshiri</a>, a senior PLO figure, was killed in Paris by a bomb concealed in the table below his telephone, though the film depicts the bomb being concealed in the telephone itself, other details of the assassination (such as confirmation of the target via telephone call) are accurate. Others killed during this period include <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mohammed_Boudia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Mohammed Boudia (page does not exist)">Mohammed Boudia</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basil_al-Kubasi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Basil al-Kubasi (page does not exist)">Basil al-Kubasi</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abad_al-Chir&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Abad al-Chir (page does not exist)">Abad al-Chir</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zaid_Muchassi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Zaid Muchassi (page does not exist)">Zaid Muchassi</a>, some of whose deaths are depicted in the film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Hassan_Salameh" title="Ali Hassan Salameh">Ali Hassan Salameh</a> was also a real person, and a prominent member of Black September. He was killed by car bomb in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut" title="Beirut">Beirut</a> in 1979.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The commando raid in Beirut, known as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Spring_of_Youth" title="Operation Spring of Youth">Operation Spring of Youth</a>, also occurred. This attack included future Israeli Prime Minister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Barak" title="Ehud Barak">Ehud Barak</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War" title="Yom Kippur War">Yom Kippur War</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Entebbe" title="Operation Entebbe">Operation Entebbe</a> hero <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonatan_Netanyahu" title="Yonatan Netanyahu">Yonatan Netanyahu</a>, who are both portrayed by name in the film. The methods used to track down and assassinate the Black September members were much more complicated than the methods portrayed in the film; for example, the tracking of the Black September cell members was achieved by a network of Mossad agents, not an informant as depicted in the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Productions" title="Atlantic Productions">Atlantic Productions</a>, producers of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts" title="British Academy of Film and Television Arts">BAFTA</a>-nominated documentary <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich:_Mossad%27s_Revenge" title="Munich: Mossad's Revenge">Munich: Mossad's Revenge</a></i>, listed several discrepancies between Spielberg's film and the information it obtained from interviews with Mossad agents involved in the operation. It noted that the film suggests one group carried out almost all the assassinations, whereas in reality it was a much larger team. Mossad did not work with a mysterious French underworld figure as portrayed in the book and the film. The assassination campaign did not end because agents lost their nerve but because of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillehammer_affair" title="Lillehammer affair">Lillehammer affair</a> in which an innocent Moroccan waiter was killed. This is not mentioned in the film. The targets were not all directly involved in Munich, which Spielberg only acknowledges in the last 5 minutes.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned above, the film notably ignored the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillehammer_affair" title="Lillehammer affair">Lillehammer affair</a>, where Israeli assassins murdered a Moroccan waiter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Bouchiki" title="Ahmed Bouchiki">Ahmed Bouchiki</a>, mistaking him for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Hassan_Salameh" title="Ali Hassan Salameh">Ali Hassan Salameh</a>. As Bristol University History professor Stephen Howe says: "one major puzzle has gone almost unremarked. If... the key (and in itself laudable) impetus for the film's making was the moral questioning prompted by Israeli 'counter-terrorist' actions, why focus on these particular episodes? The film doesn't even include the most glaring and notorious failure, which was also perhaps the most indefensible act... This was the killing in Norway of a hapless and harmless Moroccan waiter, mistaken for alleged Black September boss Ali Hassan Salameh."</p>
