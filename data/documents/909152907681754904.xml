				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>George Orson Welles</b> (May 6, 1915 –

Welles
					was also an accomplished <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)" title="Magic (illusion)">magician</a>, starring in troop variety spectacles
					in the war years. Noted for his innovative dramatic productions as well as his

					</i> and <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimes_at_Midnight" title="Chimes at Midnight">Chimes at Midnight</a>

						Ten Directors</i>.</p>
			</wiki:abstract>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles was born May 6, 1915, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenosha" title="Kenosha">Kenosha</a>, Wisconsin and was brought up a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a>. Despite his parents'
				affluence, Welles encountered many hardships in childhood. In 1919, his parents
				separated and moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and his
				father became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles's mother died of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice" title="Jaundice">jaundice</a> on May 10, 1924, in a Chicago hospital, four days after Welles's
				ninth birthday. After his mother's death, Welles ceased pursuing his interest in
				music. Richard Welles died when Orson was 15, the summer after Orson's graduation
				from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_School_for_Boys" title="Todd School for Boys">Todd School for Boys</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_Illinois" title="Woodstock, Illinois">Woodstock, Illinois</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maurice Bernstein became his guardian. Born in
				Russia, he came to Chicago in 1890, studied and became a successful physician. In a
				very few years, he had several wives, including the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Lyric_Opera" title="Chicago Lyric Opera">Chicago Lyric Opera</a> soprano, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Mason" title="Edith Mason">Edith
					Mason</a>. Edith divorced company director Giorgio Polacco to marry Bernstein.
				Not long thereafter, they divorced and she remarried Polacco.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Todd, Welles came under the positive
				influence and guidance of Roger Hill, a teacher who later became Todd's headmaster.
				Hill provided Welles with an 'ad hoc' educational environment that proved invaluable
				to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that
				interested him. Welles performed and staged his first theatrical experiments and
				productions there.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On his father's death, Welles traveled to Europe
				with the aid of a small inheritance. While on a walking and painting trip through
				Ireland, he strode into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_Theatre" title="Gate Theatre">Gate
					Theatre</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> and claimed he was a Broadway star. Gate manager <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilton_Edwards" title="Hilton Edwards">Hilton Edwards</a> later claimed he didn't believe him
				but was impressed by his brashness and some impassioned quality in his audition.
				Welles made his stage debut at the Gate in 1931, appearing in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew_Suss" title="Jew Suss">Jew Suss</a>
				</i> as the Duke. He acted to great acclaim, acclaim that reached the United States.
				He performed smaller supporting roles as well. On returning to the United States he
				found his brief fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd that would
				become the immensely successful <i>Everybody's Shakespeare</i>, and subsequently,
					<i>The Mercury Shakespeare</i>. Welles traveled to North Africa while working on
				thousands of illustrations for the <i>Everybody's Shakespeare</i> series of
				educational books, a series that remained in print for decades.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An introduction by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thornton_Wilder" title="Thornton Wilder">Thornton Wilder</a> led Welles to the New York stage. He toured in three
				off-Broadway productions with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Cornell" title="Katharine Cornell">Katharine Cornell</a>'s company. Restless and impatient when the planned
				Broadway opening of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was canceled, Welles staged a drama
				festival of his own with the Todd School, inviting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miche%C3%A1l_MacLiamm%C3%B3ir" title="Micheál MacLiammóir">Micheál MacLiammóir</a> and Hilton Edwards from
				Dublin's Gate Theatre to appear, along with New York stage luminaries. It was a
				roaring success. The subsequent revival of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> brought Welles to
				the notice of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a>, who was then casting for an unusual
				lead actor and about to take a lead role in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Theatre_Project" title="Federal Theatre Project">Federal Theatre Project</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 1935 Welles was supplementing his earnings in
				the theater as a radio actor in New York City, working with many of the actors who
				would later form the core of his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Theatre" title="Mercury Theatre">Mercury Theatre</a>. He married actress and socialite Virginia Nicholson in
				1934. They had one daughter, Christopher, who became known as Chris Welles Feder, an
				author of educational materials for children. Welles also shot an eight-minute
				silent short film, <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Age" title="Hearts of Age">The Hearts of Age</a>
				</i> with Nicholson.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1936, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Theatre_Project" title="Federal Theatre Project">Federal Theatre Project</a> (part of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration" title="Works Progress Administration">Works Progress Administration</a>) put
				unemployed theatre performers and employees to work. Welles was hired by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a> and assigned to direct a project for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem" title="Harlem">Harlem</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Negro_Theater" title="American Negro Theater">American Negro Theater</a>. He offered them <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>,</i> set the production in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti" title="Haiti">Haitian</a> court of
				King <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Christophe" title="Henri Christophe">Henri Christophe</a> (and with voodoo witch doctors for
				the three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Sisters" title="Weird Sisters">Weird Sisters</a>). <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Carter" title="Jack Carter">Jack
					Carter</a> played Macbeth. The play was rapturously received and later toured
				the nation. At the age of 20, Welles was hailed as a prodigy.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the success of <i>Macbeth</i>, Welles
				mounted the absurd farce <i>Horse Eats Hat</i>. He consolidated his "White Hope"
				reputation with <i>Dr Faustus</i>. This was even more ground-breaking theatre than
					<i>Macbeth</i>, using light as a prime unifying scenic element in a nearly
				blacked-out stage. In 1937, he rehearsed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Blitzstein" title="Marc Blitzstein">Marc
					Blitzstein</a>'s pro-union "labour opera" <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cradle_Will_Rock" title="The Cradle Will Rock">The Cradle Will Rock</a>
				</i>. Because of severe federal cutbacks and perhaps rumoured Congressional worries
				about communist propaganda in the Federal Theatre, the show's premiere at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Elliott_Theatre" title="Maxine Elliott Theatre">Maxine Elliott Theatre</a> was cancelled and the
				theatre locked and guarded by National Guardsmen. In a last-minute theatrical coup
				Welles announced to waiting ticket-holders that the show was being transferred to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Century_Theatre" title="New Century Theatre">the Venice</a>, about twenty blocks away. Cast, crew
				and audience walked the distance on foot. Since the unions forbade the actors and
				musicians performing from the stage, <i>The Cradle Will Rock</i> began with
				Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage, with
				the cast performing their parts from the audience. This impromptu performance was a
				tremendous hit.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resigning from the Federal Theatre, Welles and
				Houseman formed their own company, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Theatre" title="Mercury Theatre">Mercury Theatre</a>, which included actors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Moorehead" title="Agnes Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph
					Cotten</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Collins_(actor)" title="Ray Collins (actor)">Ray Collins</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Coulouris" title="George Coulouris">George Coulouris</a>, Frank Readick, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Sloane" title="Everett Sloane">Everett Sloane</a>, Eustace Wyatt and Erskine Sanford, all of whom would
				continue to work for Welles for years. The first Mercury Theatre production was a
				melodramatic and heavily edited version of Shakespeare's <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)" title="Julius Caesar (play)">Julius Caesar</a>
				</i>, set in a contemporary frame of fascist Italy. Cinna the Poet dies at the hands
				not of a mob but a secret police force. According to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Lloyd" title="Norman Lloyd">Norman
					Lloyd</a>, who played Cinna, "it stopped the show". The applause lasted more
				than 3 minutes and the production was widely acclaimed.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles was increasingly active on radio, as an
				actor and soon as a director and producer. He played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> on
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Radio_Workshop" title="CBS Radio Workshop">The Columbia Workshop</a>, adapting and directing the
				play himself. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Network" title="Mutual Network">Mutual
					Network</a> gave him a seven-week series to adapt <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables" title="Les Misérables">Les Misérables</a>
				</i>, which he did with great success. Welles was chosen to anonymously play Lamont
				Cranston, <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow" title="The Shadow">The Shadow</a>
				</i>, in late 1937 (again for Mutual) and in the summer of 1938 CBS gave him (and
				the Mercury Theatre) a weekly hour-long show to broadcast radio plays based on
				classic literary works. The show was titled <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Theatre" title="Mercury Theatre">The Mercury Theatre on the Air</a>
				</i>, with original music by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>, who would continue working with Welles on radio and in
				films for years.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Their October 30 broadcast, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="H. G. Wells">H. G.
					Wells</a>'s <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(radio)" title="The War of the Worlds (radio)">The War of the Worlds</a>
				</i>, brought Welles notoriety and instant fame on both a national and international
				level. The fortuitous mixture of news bulletin format with the between-breaks dial
				spinning habits of listeners from the rival and far more popular <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Bergen" title="Edgar Bergen">Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy program</a>
				</i>, created widespread confusion among late tuners. Panic spread among many
				listeners who believed the news reports of an actual Martian invasion. The resulting
				panic was duly reported around the world and disparagingly mentioned by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in a public speech a few months later.
				Welles's growing fame soon drew Hollywood offers, lures which the independent-minded
				Welles resisted at first. However, <i>The Mercury Theatre on the Air</i>, which had
				been a "sustaining show" (without sponsorship) was picked up by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Soup_Company" title="Campbell Soup Company">Campbell Soup</a> and renamed <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Campbell_Playhouse" title="The Campbell Playhouse">The Campbell Playhouse</a>
				</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">RKO
					Pictures</a> president <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Schaefer_(film_producer)" title="George Schaefer (film producer)">George Schaefer</a> eventually offered
				Welles what is generally considered the greatest contract ever offered to an untried
				director: complete artistic control. RKO signed Welles in a two-picture deal;
				including script, cast, crew, and most important, final cut, though Welles had a
				budget limit for his projects. With this contract in hand, Welles (and nearly the
				entire Mercury Theatre) moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>.
				He commuted weekly to New York to maintain his commitment to <i>The Campbell
					Playhouse</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles toyed with various ideas for his first
				project for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">RKO Pictures</a>, settling on an adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad" title="Joseph Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>'s <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness" title="Heart of Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a>
				</i>, which he worked on in great detail. He planned to film the action with a
				subjective camera from the protagonist's point of view. When a budget was drawn up,
				RKO's enthusiasm cooled, as it was greater than the previously agreed limit. RKO
				also declined to approve another Welles project, <i>The Smiler with the Knife</i>
				ostensibly because they lacked faith in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Ball" title="Lucille Ball">Lucille
					Ball</a>'s ability to carry the leading lady role.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a sign of things to come, Welles left <i>The
					Campbell Playhouse</i> in 1940, due to creative differences with the sponsor.
				The show continued without him, produced by John Houseman. In perhaps another sign
				of things to come, Welles's first actual experience on a Hollywood film was as
				narrator for RKO's 1940 production of <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Family_Robinson" title="Swiss Family Robinson">Swiss Family Robinson</a>
				</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles found a suitable film project in an idea
				he conceived with screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_J._Mankiewicz" title="Herman J. Mankiewicz">Herman J. Mankiewicz</a> (who was then writing
				radio plays for <i>The Campbell Playhouse</i>). Initially called <i>American</i>, it
				would eventually become Welles's first feature film (also his most famous and
				honored role), <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a>
				</i> (1941).</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mankiewicz based his original notion on an
					<i>exposé</i> of the life of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst" title="William Randolph Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, whom he knew
				socially but now hated, having once been great friends with Hearst's mistress, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Davies" title="Marion Davies">Marion Davies</a>. Mankiewicz was now banished from her
				company because of his perpetual drunkenness. Mankiewicz, a notorious gossip,
				exacted revenge with his unflattering depiction of Davies in <i>Citizen Kane</i> for
				which Welles got most of the criticisms; Welles also had a connection with Davies
				through his first wife. Kane's megalomaniac personality was also loosely modeled on
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_R._McCormick" title="Robert R. McCormick">Robert McCormick</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard
					Hughes</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Pulitzer" title="Joseph Pulitzer">Joseph Pulitzer</a>, as Welles wanted to create a broad, complex character,
				intending to show him in the same scenes from several points of view. The use of
				multiple narrative perspectives in Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness</i> also influenced
				the treatment. Supplying Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes, Welles urged him to
				write the first draft of a screenplay under the watchful nursing of John Houseman,
				who was posted to ensure Mankiewicz stayed sober. On Welles's instruction, Houseman
				wrote the opening narration as a pastiche of <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_March_of_Time" title="The March of Time">The March of Time</a>
				</i> newsreels. Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged
				them, then added scenes of his own.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The resulting character of Charles Foster Kane
				is loosely based on parts of Hearst's life. Nonetheless, autobiographical allusions
				to Welles himself were worked in, most noticeably in the treatment of Kane's
				childhood, particularly regarding his guardianship. Welles then added features from
				other famous American lives to create a general and mysterious personality rather
				than the narrow journalistic portrait intended by Mankiewicz, whose first drafts
				included scandalous claims about the death of the film director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ince" title="Thomas Ince">Thomas
					Ince</a>, killed on an excursion on a Hearst yacht.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once the script was completed. Welles attracted
				some of Hollywood's best technicians, including cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Toland" title="Gregg Toland">Gregg
					Toland</a>, who walked into Welles's office and announced he wanted to work on
				the picture. For the cast, Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre. He
				invited suggestions from everyone, but only if they were directed through him.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mankiewicz handed a copy of the final shooting
				script to his friend, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lederer" title="Charles Lederer">Charles Lederer</a>, now husband of Welles's ex-wife Virginia Nicholson and
				nephew of Hearst's mistress Marion Davies. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedda_Hopper" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda
					Hopper</a> saw a small ad in a newspaper for a preview screening of <i>Citizen
					Kane</i> and went. Hopper, realizing immediately that the film was based on
				features of Hearst's life, reported this back to him and threatened to give
				"Hollywood, Private Lives" if that was what it wanted. Thus began the struggle over
				the attempted suppression of <i>Citizen Kane</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hearst's media outlets boycotted the film. It
				exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community by threatening to expose
				15 years of suppressed scandals and the fact that most of the studio bosses were
				Jewish. At one point, the heads of the major studios jointly offered RKO the cost of
				the film in exchange for the negative and all existing prints, for the express
				purpose of burning it. RKO declined, and the film was given a limited release.
				Meanwhile, Hearst successfully intimidated theatre chains by threatening to ban
				advertising for any of their other films in any of his papers if they showed
					<i>Citizen Kane</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the film was critically well-received, by
				the time it reached the general public the positive tide of publicity had waned. It
				garnered nine Academy Award nominations, but won only for Best Original Screenplay,
				shared by Mankiewicz and Welles. The delay in its release and its uneven
				distribution contributed to its average result at the box-office, making back its
				budget and marketing, but RKO lost any chance of a major profit. The fact that
					<i>Citizen Kane</i> ignored many Hollywood conventions also meant that the film
				confused and angered the 1940s cinema public. Exhibitor response was scathing; most
				theater owners complained bitterly about the adverse audience reaction and the many

				shelved the film and did not re-release it until 1956. During the 1950s, the film
				came to be seen by young French film critics such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" title="François Truffaut">François Truffaut</a> as exemplifying the "auteur
				theory", in which the director is the "author" of a film. Truffaut, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard" title="Jean-Luc Godard">Godard</a> and others were inspired by Welles's example
				to make their own films, giving birth to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle_Vague" title="Nouvelle Vague">Nouvelle Vague</a>. In the 1960s <i>Citizen Kane</i> became popular on college

George Schaefer hoped to make back the money lost by

				was slow and the film lagged behind schedule and over budget. Prior to productions,
				Welles' contract was renegotiated, revoking his right to control the final cut.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At RKO's request, simultaneously, Welles worked

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles was then offered a new radio series by
				CBS. Called <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orson_Welles_Show" title="The Orson Welles Show">The Orson Welles Show</a>

					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_into_Fear_(film)" title="Journey into Fear (film)">Journey into Fear</a>

				Ending his CBS radio show, he lashed together a rough cut of <i>Ambersons</i> with
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wise" title="Robert Wise">Robert Wise</a>, who had edited <i>Citizen Kane</i>, and

				disagreed. With Welles in South America, there was no practical means of having him
				edit the film.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Major changes occurred at RKO in 1942. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Odlum" title="Floyd Odlum">Floyd Odlum</a> took over control of the studio began
				changing its direction. Rockefeller, the most significant backer of the Brazil
				project, left the RKO board of directors. Around the same time, the principal
				sponsor of Welles at RKO, studio president George Schaefer, resigned. The changes
				throughout RKO caused reevaluations of many projects. RKO took control of
					<i>Ambersons</i>, formed a committee which was ordered to edit the film into
				what the studio considered a commercial format. They removed fifty minutes of
				Welles's footage, re-shot sequences, rearranged the scene order, and added a new
				happy ending. Koerner released the shortened film on the bottom of a double-bill
				with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupe_Velez" title="Lupe Velez">Lupe Velez</a> comedy <i>Mexican Spitfire Sees a Ghost</i>.

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles's South American documentary, titled <i>

				</i>, budgeted at one million dollars with half of its budget coming from the U.S.
				Government upon completion, grew in ambition and budget while Welles was in South
				America. While the film was originally to be a documentary on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnaval" title="Carnaval">Carnaval</a>,
				Welles added a new story which recreated the journey of the <i>jangadeiros</i>, four
				poor fishermen who had made a 1,500-mile (2,400 km) journey on their open raft to
				petition Brazilian President Vargas about their working conditions. The four had
				become national folk heroes, Welles first read of their journey in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a>
				</i>. Their leader, Jacare, died during a filming mishap. RKO, in limited contact
				with Welles, attempted to rein in the production. Most of the crew and budget were
				withdrawn from the film. In addition, the Mercury staff was removed from the studio
				in the US.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles requested resources to finish the film.
				He was given a limited amount of black-and-white stock and a silent camera. He
				completed the sequence, but RKO refused to support any further production on the
				film. Surviving footage was released in 1993, including a rough reconstruction of
				the Four Men on a Raft segment. Meanwhile, RKO asserted in public that Welles had
				gone to Brazil without a screenplay and that he had squandered a million dollars.
				Their official company slogan for the next year was "Showmanship in place of Genius"
				which was taken as a slight against Welles.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On returning to Hollywood, Welles found no
				studios interested in hiring him as a film director after the twin disasters of
					<i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> and <i>It's All True</i>. Welles afterward
				worked on radio. CBS offered him two weekly series, <i>Hello Americans</i>, based on
				the research he'd done in Brazil, and <i>Ceiling Unlimited</i>, sponsored by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation" title="Lockheed Corporation">Lockheed</a>, a wartime salute to advances in
				aviation. Both featured several members of his original Mercury Theatre. Within a
				few months, <i>Hello Americans</i> was canceled and Welles was replaced as host of
					<i>Ceiling Unlimited</i> by Joseph Cotten. Welles guest-starred on a great
				variety of shows, notably guest-hosting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny" title="Jack Benny">Jack
				Benny</a>'s show for a month in 1943. He took an increasingly active role in
				American and international politics and used journalism to communicate his forceful
				ideas widely.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1943, Welles married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth" title="Rita Hayworth">Rita
					Hayworth</a>. They had one child, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Welles" title="Rebecca Welles">Rebecca Welles</a>, and divorced five years later in 1948. In between, Welles
				found work as an actor in other directors' films. He starred in the 1943 film
				adaptation of <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre_(1944_film)" title="Jane Eyre (1944 film)">Jane Eyre</a>
				</i>, trading credit as associate producer for top billing over <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Fontaine" title="Joan Fontaine">Joan

					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow_the_Boys" title="Follow the Boys">Follow the Boys</a>
				</i>, in which he performed his <i>Mercury Wonder Show</i> magic act and sawed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich" title="Marlene Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a> in half after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a>
				refused to allow Hayworth to perform.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1944, Welles was offered a new radio show,
				broadcast only in California. <i>Orson Welles's Almanac</i> was another half-hour
				variety show, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobil_Oil" title="Mobil Oil">Mobil Oil</a> as sponsor. After the success of his stand-in
				hosting on <i>The Jack Benny Show</i>, the focus was primarily on comedy. His
				hosting on Jack Benny included several self-deprecating jokes and story lines about
				his being a "genius" and overriding any ideas advanced by other cast members. The
				trade papers were not eager to accept Welles as a comedian, and Welles often
				complained on-air about the poor quality of the scripts. When Welles started his
					<i>Mercury Wonder Show</i> a few months later, traveling to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces" title="Armed Forces">Armed
					Forces</a> camps and performing magic tricks and doing comedy, the radio show
				was broadcast live from the camps and the material took a decidedly wartime flavor.
				Of his original Mercury actors, only Agnes Moorehead was left. The series was
				cancelled by year's end due to poor ratings.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While he found no studio willing to hire him as
				a film director, Welles's popularity as an actor continued. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pabst_Blue_Ribbon" title="Pabst Blue Ribbon">Pabst Blue Ribbon</a> gave Welles their radio series <i>This Is My Best</i> to
				direct, but after one month he was fired for creative differences. He started
				writing a political column for the <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</a>
				</i>, again called <i>Orson Welles Almanac</i>. While the paper wanted Welles to
				write about Hollywood gossip, Welles explored serious political issues. His activism
				for world peace took considerable amounts of his time. The <i>Post</i> column
				eventually failed in syndication because of contradictory expectations and was
				dropped by the <i>Post</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1946, International Pictures released
				Welles's film <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_(film)" title="The Stranger (film)">The Stranger</a>
				</i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_G._Robinson" title="Edward G. Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Young" title="Loretta Young">Loretta
					Young</a> and Welles. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Spiegel" title="Sam Spiegel">Sam
					Spiegel</a> produced the film, which follows the hunt for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> war criminal
				living under an alias in America. While Anthony Veiller was credited with the
				screenplay, it had been rewritten by Welles and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John
					Huston</a>. Welles's most imaginative work on the film was cut out by Spiegel,
				and the result apart from some bravura sequences on the clock tower or evoking the
				small town atmosphere, was a comparatively conventional Hollywood thriller. It was
				successful at the box office but Welles resolved not to have a career as a cog in a
				Hollywood studio. He resumed his struggle for the creative control which had
				originally brought him to Hollywood.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the summer of 1946, Welles directed a musical
				stage version of <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days_(book)" title="Around the World in Eighty Days (book)">Around the World in Eighty
						Days</a>
				</i>, with a comedic and ironic rewriting of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne" title="Jules Verne">Jules
					Verne</a> novel by Welles, incidental music and songs by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Porter" title="Cole Porter">Cole
					Porter</a>, and production by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Todd" title="Mike Todd">Mike Todd</a>,
				who would later produce the successful film version with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Niven" title="David Niven">David
					Niven</a>. When Todd pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, Welles
				supported the finances himself. When he ran out of money at one point, he convinced
				Columbia president <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a>
				to send him enough to continue the show, and in exchange Welles promised to write,
				produce, direct and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee. The stage show would
				soon fail due to poor box-office, with Welles unable to claim the losses on his
				taxes. He wound up owing the IRS several hundred thousand dollars, and in a few
				years time Welles would seek tax-shelter in Europe.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the same time in 1946 he began two new radio
				series, <i>The Mercury Summer Theatre</i> for CBS and <i>Orson Welles
					Commentaries</i> for ABC. While <i>Summer Theatre</i> featured half-hour
				adaptations of some of the classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first
				episode was a condensation of his <i>Around the World</i> stage play, and remains
				the only record of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Porter" title="Cole Porter">Cole
					Porter</a>'s music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for
				the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. It was only scheduled for the summer
				months, and Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play.
					<i>Commentaries</i> was a political soap-box, continuing the themes from his New
				York Post column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP" title="NAACP">NAACP</a> brought to his
				attention the case of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Woodard" title="Isaac Woodard">Isaac
					Woodard</a>. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard's cause. Soon
				Welles was being hung in effigy in the South and theaters refused to show the <i>The
					Stranger</i> in several southern states.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film for Cohn wound up being <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_from_Shanghai" title="The Lady from Shanghai">The Lady from Shanghai</a>
				</i>, filmed in 1947 for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. Intended to be a modest thriller, the budget skyrocketed
				after Cohn suggested that Welles's then-estranged second wife Rita Hayworth co-star.
				Cohn was enraged by Welles's rough-cut, in particular the confusing plot and lack of
				close-ups, and ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the
				studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut had been removed. While
				expressing dismay at the cuts, Welles was particularly appalled by the soundtrack,
				objecting to the musical score he thought more suitable for a Disney cartoon and the
				lack of the ambient soundscape he had designed. The film was considered a disaster
				in America at the time of release. Welles recalled people refusing to speak to him
				about it to save him embarrassment. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth
				finalized their divorce. Though the film was acclaimed in Europe, it was not
				embraced in the US for several decades. A similar situation occurred when Welles
				suggested to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Chaplin" title="Charles Chaplin">Charles Chaplin</a> that he star in a film directed by
				Welles based on the life of the French <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer" title="Serial killer">serial
					killer</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9_Landru" title="Henri Désiré Landru">Henri Désiré Landru</a>. Chaplin instead adapted the
				idea for his own film, <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsieur_Verdoux" title="Monsieur Verdoux">Monsieur Verdoux</a>
				</i>, with Welles officially credited for the idea. The film proved a failure
				opening during a time when Chaplin was publicly vilified, but since has gone on to
				be acclaimed as a classic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy" title="Black comedy">black
					comedy</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unable to find work as a director at any of the
				major studios, in 1948 Welles convinced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Pictures" title="Republic Pictures">Republic Pictures</a> to let him direct a low-budget version of <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth_(1948)" title="Macbeth (1948)">Macbeth</a>
				</i>, which featured <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papier_mache" title="Papier mache">papier
					mâché</a> sets, cardboard crowns and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a
				prerecorded soundtrack. Republic did not care for the Scottish accents on the
				soundtrack and held up release for almost a year. Welles left for Europe, while his
				co-producer and life-long supporter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wilson" title="Richard Wilson">Richard Wilson</a> reworked the soundtrack. Welles ultimately returned and cut
				twenty minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover
				the gaps. The film was decried as another disaster. In the late 1970s,
					<i>Macbeth</i> was restored to Welles's original version.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During this time, Welles sought to adapt the
				radio and serial series <i>The Shadow</i> to the big screen. He aimed to direct,
				produce, write and star in the film, but the project collapsed when he failed to
				find any investors. The Mark Millar article detailing Welles's attempt at a Batman
				film is partially inspired by this.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles left Hollywood for Europe in late 1947,
				enigmatically saying he had chosen "freedom". This must refer to both acting offers
				and the possibility of directing and producing films again.</p>

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also in 1955 Welles directed two television
				series for the BBC. The first was <i>Orson Welles's Sketchbook</i>, a series of six

				case, was suppressed at the time by the French government, but was reconstructed
				after Welles's death and released to video in 1999.</p>

				and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot. Welles wrote a 58-page memo
				outlining suggestions and objections. The studio followed a few of the ideas, but
				cut another 30 minutes from the film and released it. The film was widely praised

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles's exile from Hollywood and reliance on
				independent production meant that many of his later projects were filmed piecemeal
				or were not completed. In the mid-1950s, Welles began work on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Cervantes'</a> masterpiece <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a>
				</i>, initially a commission from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> television. Welles
				expanded the film to feature length, developing the screenplay to take Quixote and
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancho_Panza" title="Sancho Panza">Sancho Panza</a> into the modern age. Filming stopped with
				the death of Francisco Reiguera, the actor playing Quixote, in 1969. Orson Welles
				continued editing the film through the next few decades and had supposedly completed
				a rough cut in the mid 1970s. By his death however, the footage of many scenes had
				been lost around the world during Welles's travels. A search continues for Orson
				Welles's later edits and other missing footage, but they likely no longer exist. An
				incomplete version of the film was released in 1992.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1970 Welles began shooting <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Side_of_the_Wind" title="The Other Side of the Wind">The Other Side of the Wind</a>
				</i>, about the effort of a film director (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John
					Huston</a>) to complete his last Hollywood picture, and is largely set at a
				lavish party. Although in 1972 the film was reported by Welles as being "96%
				complete", the negative remained in a Paris vault until 2004, when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> (who also acted in the film)
				announced his intention to complete the production. Peter Bogdanovich is currently

				documentary <i>Working with Orson Welles</i> (1993).</p>

				signed on, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Everett" title="Rupert Everett">Rupert
					Everett</a> to play the young Orson Welles, location filming was to be done in
				New York City with studio work in Italy. While pre-production went without a
				problem, three weeks before filming was to begin the money fell through. Allegedly
				Welles approached <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> to ask for assistance in rescuing the film, but Spielberg
				declined. The scripts to both films were published posthumously. After a studio
				auction, he complained that Spielberg spent $50,000 for the Rosebud sled used in
					<i>Citizen Kane</i>, but would not give him a dime to make a picture. Welles
				retaliated by publicly announcing the sled to be a fake, the original having been
				burned in the film, but he later recanted the claim.</p>

				a college lecture given by Welles not long before his death, in which he displays
				frustration at being unable to complete so many projects. According to Oja Kodar,
				interviewed in the documentary, Welles always traveled with camera equipment and
				would shoot film whenever the mood struck him, even if there were no immediate

				</h2>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film opens in a night setting on a vast
					palatial estate on which the sign "No Trespassing" is posted. Gradually the
					camera comes to rest in a bedroom on which an elderly man is lying, holding a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_globe" title="Snow globe">snow globe</a>. He utters the word "Rosebud" and lets go
					of the snow globe which drops and smashes on the floor. A nurse enters and
					covers the man in a way that indicates he has died. The scene fades out.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An abrupt cut leads to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsreel" title="Newsreel">newsreel</a>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obituary" title="Obituary">obituary</a> in which we find out that the estate was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanadu_(Citizen_Kane)" title="Xanadu (Citizen Kane)">Xanadu</a> and the man who owned it and died
					there was the enormously wealthy <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_proprietor" title="Media proprietor">media magnate</a> Charles Foster Kane (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a>). The newsreel reveals details of his
					life - how his childhood was spent in poverty, then changed when gold was
					discovered in his family's mine, how he built up his empire of newspapers, how
					both his marriages were unsuccessful, his conflicting pronouncements, and how
					the power he once obtained disappeared.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After its preview, the producer of the
					newsreel feels that it lacks something and asks a reporter, Jerry Thompson (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Alland" title="William Alland">William Alland</a>), to find out about Kane's private
					life and personality, in particular to discover the meaning behind his last
					word. The reporter interviews the great man's friends and associates, and Kane's
					story unfolds as a series of flashbacks, some of which present the same
					incidents portrayed in the newsreel, but from different recollections.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, Thompson approaches Kane's second
					wife, Susan Alexander (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Comingore" title="Dorothy Comingore">Dorothy Comingore</a>), now an alcoholic who runs
					her own club, but she refuses to tell him anything. Thompson then goes to the
					private archive of Walter Parks Thatcher (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Coulouris" title="George Coulouris">George Coulouris</a>), a deceased banker who served
					as Kane's guardian during his childhood. It is through Thatcher's written
					memoirs that Thompson learns about Kane's childhood. In the first flashback,
					Kane as a young child is forced to leave his beloved mother (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Moorehead" title="Agnes Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a>) when he becomes suddenly wealthy after becoming an
					heir to a silver mine, and is sent to live with Mr. Thatcher.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thompson then interviews Kane's personal
					business manager Mr. Bernstein (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Sloane" title="Everett Sloane">Everett Sloane</a>), best friend Jedediah Leland (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>), Susan for a second time, and Kane's butler Raymond (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Stewart_(actor)" title="Paul Stewart (actor)">Paul Stewart</a>) who recalls him saying
					"Rosebud" while holding a small glass globe — the same globe Kane dropped as he
					died. However, Thompson thinks this is worth very little. Other flashbacks show
					Kane's entry into the newspaper business and his profit-seeking with low-quality
						"<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism" title="Yellow journalism">yellow journalism</a>". He takes control of the
					newspaper, the <i>New York Inquirer</i>, and hires all the best journalists
					(which he hires away from the <i>Chronicle</i>, the main rival of the
						<i>Inquirer</i>). His attempted rise to power is documented, including his
					first marriage to Emily Monroe Norton (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Warrick" title="Ruth Warrick">Ruth
						Warrick</a>), a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President's</a> niece, shown
					disintegrating through fragments of conversations at breakfast over many years,
					and his campaign for the office of governor of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State" title="New York State">New York State</a>. A "love nest" scandal with Susan Alexander ends both
					his first marriage and his political aspirations. Kane marries his mistress, but
					as a result of his domineering personality, he forces Susan into an operatic
					career for which she has no talent or ambition, destroys his relationships and
					pushes away his loved ones. Kane spends his last years building his vast estate
					and lives alone after Susan leaves him, interacting only with his staff.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite Thompson's interviews, he is unable
					to solve the mystery and concludes that "Rosebud" will forever remain an enigma.
					At that point, the camera pans over workers burning some of Kane's many
					possessions. One throws an old sled into the furnace – the same sled that Kane
					was riding as a child the day his mother sent him away. The word "Rosebud"
					painted on the sled burns as the camera closes in on it in the furnace. There is
					a shot of a chimney with black smoke coming out. For the viewer this solves the
					"Rosebud" mystery, the sled is a token of the only time in his life when he was
					poor; more than this, however, it represents the only time in his life when he
					was truly happy and wanted for nothing. After this <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_ending" title="Twist ending">twist
						ending</a>, the film ends as it began, with the "No Trespassing" sign at the
					gates of Kane's estate, Xanadu, an indication that sometimes we can never know
					the truth behind people.</p>
			</wiki:plot>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Richard Carringer, author of <i>The Making of
					Citizen Kane</i> (1996), described the early stages of the screenplay:</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, according to film author Harlan Lebo,
				he was also "one of Hollywood's most notorious personalities." <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"></span> Mankiewicz
				was the older brother of producer-director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Mankiewicz" title="Joseph Mankiewicz">Joseph Mankiewicz</a> and was a former writer for <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a>
				</i> and the <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>
				</i> and had moved to Hollywood in 1926. By the time Welles contacted him he had
				"established himself as a brilliant wit, a writer of extraordinary talent, [and] a
				warm friend to many of the screen world's brightest artists ... [he] produced
				dialogue of the highest caliber."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"></span> Yet Mankiewicz's behavior, according to Welles's
				close friend and associate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John
					Houseman</a>, was also a "public and private scandal. A neurotic drinker and
				compulsive gambler..." Houseman adds, however, that he was also one of the most
				intelligent, informed, witty, humane and charming men I have ever known." <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"></span> Despite
				those apparent contradictions in his personality, Welles "recognized the writer's
				abilities and trusted him to produce," wrote Lebo. Orson Welles himself later
				commented, "Nobody was more miserable, more bitter, and funnier than Mank - a
				perfect monument to self-destruction. But when the bitterness wasn't focused
				straight at you -- he was the best company in the world." </p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to film historian Clinton Heylin, "the
				idea of <i>Citizen Kane</i> was the original conception of Orson Welles, who in
				early 1940 first discussed the idea with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John
					Houseman</a>. . .who then suggested that both he and Welles leave for Los
				Angeles and discuss the idea with scriptwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Mankiewicz" title="Herman Mankiewicz">Herman Mankiewicz</a>. He adds that Mankiewicz "probably believed that Welles
				had little experience as an original scriptwriter. . .[and] may even have felt that
					<i>John Citizen USA</i>, Welles's working title, was a project he could make his
				own." <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"></span></p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Still incapacitated with a broken leg,
				Mankiewicz was happy to work with Welles, and an "alliance" for formed, noted
				Houseman. This combination of a "brash new director, a nervous studio, and an
				erratic genius" gave birth to <i>Citizen Kane</i>, in what Houseman called, "an
				absurd venture."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"></span></p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Houseman recalled that Mankiewicz, during his
				convalescence, had "revived a long-simmering idea of creating a film biography in
				which a man's life would be brought to the screen after his death through the
				memories and opinions of the people who knew him best." And Welles himself, writes
				Lebo, also had ideas "that meshed well with this concept and had considered a
				newspaper publisher the best subject for the story:</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles then assigned Mankiewicz, writes Lebo,
				"to work on an original screenplay - not an adaptation as his first two projects
				would have been." Welles next traveled to New York and desperately "pleaded and
				persuaded Houseman to return to Los Angeles to manage Mankiewicz and his writing
				schedule." </p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For some time, Mankiewicz wanted to write a
				screenplay about a public figure – perhaps a gangster – whose story would be told by
				the people that knew him. He had already written an unperformed play <i>The Tree
					Will Grow</i> about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dillinger" title="John Dillinger">John
					Dillinger</a>. Orson Welles liked the idea of multiple viewpoints but was not
				interested in playing Dillinger. Mankiewicz and Welles talked about picking someone
				else to use a model.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">They eventually hit on the idea of using <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst" title="William Randolph Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> as their central
				character. Mankiewicz had frequented Hearst's parties until his alcoholism got him
				barred. And Hearst was also a person known to Welles. "Once that was decided," wrote
				author Don Kilbourne, "Mankiewicz, Welles, and John Houseman, a cofounder of the
				Mercury Theatre, rented a place in the desert, and the task of creating <i>Citizen
					Kane</i> began." <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"></span></p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mankiewicz was put under contract by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Theater" title="Mercury Theater">Mercury Productions</a> and was to receive no credit for
				his work as he was hired as a script doctor. According to his contract with RKO,
				Welles would be given sole screenplay credit, and had already written a rough script
				consisting of 300 pages of dialogue with occasional stage directions under the title
				of <i>John Citizen, USA</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the long standing academic debates of
					<i>Citizen Kane</i> has been the nature of the authorship of the original
				screenplay, which the opening credits attributes to both Welles and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_J._Mankiewicz" title="Herman J. Mankiewicz">Herman J. Mankiewicz</a>. According to film
				biographer David Thomson, however, "No one can now deny Herman Mankiewicz credit for
				the germ, shape, and pointed language of the screenplay..."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film historian Otto Friedrich wrote, it made
				Mankiewicz "unhappy to hear Welles quoted in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louella_Parsons" title="Louella Parsons">Louella Parsons</a>'s column, before the question of screen credits was
				officially settled, as saying, 'So I wrote <i>Citizen Kane</i>.' Mankiewicz went to
				the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Writers_Guild" title="Screen Writers Guild">Screen Writers Guild</a> and declared that he was
				the original author. Welles later claimed that he planned on a joint credit all
				along, but Mankiewicz claimed that Welles offered him a bonus of ten thousand
				dollars if he would let Welles take full credit. ... The Screen Writers Guild
				eventually decreed a joint credit, with Mankiewicz's name first."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most famously, film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline
					Kael</a>, in an essay titled "Raising Kane" (originally published in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a>
				</i> in 1971 and later reprinted in <i>The Citizen Kane Book</i> and in her omnibus
				collection <i>For Keeps</i>) claims that Welles downplayed veteran screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_J._Mankiewicz" title="Herman J. Mankiewicz">Herman J. Mankiewicz</a>'s contribution. Kael
				argues that Mankiewicz was the true author of the screenplay and therefore
				responsible for much of what made the movie great. This angered many critics of the
				day, most notably critic-turned-filmmaker (and close friend of Welles) <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a>, who rebutted many of Kael's
				claims in an article for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire" title="Esquire">Esquire</a> titled
					<i>The Kane Mutiny</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film historian Robert L. Carringer, after
				weighing both sides of the argument, including sworn testimony from Mercury
				assistant Richard Baer, could only conclude "We will probably never know for sure,
				but in any case Welles had at last found a subject with the right combination of
				monumentality, timeliness, and audacity."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"></span></p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The principal source for the story of <i>Citizen
					Kane</i> was the life of media tycoon <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst" title="William Randolph Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, and the film is
				seen by critics as a fictionalized, unrelentingly hostile <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody" title="Parody">parody</a> of Hearst.
				Hearst often entertained Hollywood celebrities at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearst_castle" title="Hearst castle">Hearst
					Castle</a> (just north of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo" title="San Luis Obispo">San
					Luis Obispo</a>, California) – but only as long as they revealed secrets that
				would be published the following week in the Hearst newspapers. This <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo" title="Quid pro quo">quid pro quo</a> resulted in Hearst drawing wide resentment
				from many actors and directors in Hollywood, and <i>Citizen Kane</i> was seen by
				many as payback for Hearst's exploits.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is an explicit reference to Hearst at the
				beginning of the film, possibly to imply that the film is not about him, where one
				of the men who is involved in making a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsreel" title="Newsreel">newsreel</a>
				documentary about Kane asks "How was he any different from Ford, or Hearst for that
				matter, or John Doe."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most overt reference to Hearst comes early
				in the film, as Kane provides a quote that paraphrases an apocryphal quote
				attributed to Hearst on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_American_War" title="Spanish American War">Spanish American War</a>: "You furnish the pictures
				and I'll furnish the war." Kane states, "You provide the prose poems, I'll provide
				the war." In real life, Hearst denied saying it, and the only source for the quote
				is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Creelman" title="James Creelman">James Creelman</a> memoir published several years after
				the statement was reportedly made. The newsreel additionally refers to Kane as "the
				great <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalist" title="Yellow journalist">yellow journalist</a>", a term often associated with
				Hearst papers.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles himself insisted that there were also
				differences between the men. In 1968, he told <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a>, "You know, the real story of Hearst is quite different
				from Kane's. And Hearst himself—-as a man, I mean—-was very different." In his
				documentary <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_for_Fake" title="F for Fake">F for Fake</a>,</i> Welles claims Kane was originally
				intended to be based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard
					Hughes</a> (who was to be played by Joseph Cotten) but he later changed it to
				Hearst. Hearst's biographer, David Nasaw, finds the film's depiction of Hearst
				unfair:</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several other candidates for the basis of the
				Kane personality have been suggested, the most likely being that of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Brulatour" title="Jules Brulatour">Jules Brulatour</a>, millionaire head of distribution
				for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastman_Kodak" title="Eastman Kodak">Eastman Kodak</a> and co-founder of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures" title="Universal Pictures">Universal Pictures</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brulatour's second and third wives, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Gibson" title="Dorothy Gibson">Dorothy Gibson</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hampton" title="Hope Hampton">Hope
					Hampton</a>, both fleeting stars of the silent screen who later had marginal
				careers in opera, are believed to have provided inspiration for the Susan Alexander
				character.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson
					Welles</a> also claimed that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Fowler_McCormick" title="Harold Fowler McCormick">Harold Fowler McCormick</a>'s lavish promotion
				of his second wife, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganna_Walska" title="Ganna Walska">Ganna
					Walska</a>, was a direct influence on the screenplay. McCormick spent thousands
				of dollars on voice lessons for her and even arranged for Walska to take the lead in
				a production of <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaza" title="Zaza">Zaza</a>
				</i> at the Chicago Opera in 1920. Like the Susan Alexander character, she had a
				terrible voice, pleasing only to McCormick. But unlike Alexander, Walska got into an
				argument with director Pietro Cimini during dress rehearsal and stormed out of the
				production before she appeared. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger
					Ebert</a>, in his DVD commentary on <i>Citizen Kane,</i> also suggests that the
				Alexander character was based on Walska, and had very little to do with Marion
				Davies. The film's composer Bernard Herrmann also suggests that Kane is based on
				McCormick but also in great part on Welles himself.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other sources say the Alexander role — and the
				disastrous opera singing — is a composite of Hampton, Davies, Walska, and the story
				of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Insull" title="Samuel Insull">Samuel Insull</a>, who built the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Civic_Opera_House" title="Chicago Civic Opera House">Chicago Civic Opera House</a> in 1929 for his
				daughter, who hoped to become famous and sing at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera" title="Metropolitan Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> but never did.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Citizen Kane</i> is in part based on the life
				of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Insull" title="Samuel Insull">Samuel Insull</a> and his wife Gladys. Playwright Herman
				J. Mankiewicz based Susan Alexander’s catastrophic operatic debut in <i>Citizen
					Kane</i> on Gladys Wallis Insull’s New York role as Lady Teazle in a charity
				revival of <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_for_Scandal" title="The School for Scandal">The School for Scandal</a>
				</i>. The review of Susan Alexander's debut in <i>Kane</i> echoes Mankiewicz's
				actual 1925 review of Gladys Insull. His 1925 review began: "As Lady Teazle, Mrs.
				Insull is as pretty as she is diminutive; with a clear smile and dainty gestures.
				There is a charming grace in her bearing that makes for excellent deportment. But
				Lady Teazle seems much too innocent to lend credit to her part in the play."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are autobiographical elements to the film.
				Orson Welles lost his mother when he was only nine years old and his father when he
				was 15. After this, he became the ward of Chicago's Dr. Maurice Bernstein--and
				Bernstein is the last name of the only major character in <i>Citizen Kane</i> who
				receives a completely positive portrayal.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The documentary <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_Over_Citizen_Kane" title="The Battle Over Citizen Kane">The Battle Over Citizen Kane</a>
				</i> points out the great irony that Welles's own life story resembled that of Kane
				far more than Hearst's: an overreaching <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunderkind" title="Wunderkind">wunderkind</a>
				</i> who ended up mournful and lonely in his old age. <i>Citizen Kane'</i>s editor

			</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Orson Welles, explaining the idea behind the
				word "Rosebud," said, "It's a gimmick, really, and rather dollar-book Freud." The
				symbolic sled 'Rosebud' used in the film was bought for $60,500 by film director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> in 1982, at the time the highest

				thought we burned it..."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Louis Pizzitola, author of
					<i>Hearst Over Hollywood,</i> "Rosebud" was a nickname that Orrin Peck, a friend

				<span class="mw-headline">Production</span>
			</h2>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During production, <i>Citizen Kane</i> was
				referred to as <i>RKO 281</i>. Filming took place between <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_29" title="June 29">June 29</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940" title="1940">1940</a>

				Stage 19 on the Paramount lot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>.
				Welles prevented studio executives of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">RKO</a>
				from visiting the set. He understood their desire to control projects and he knew
				they were expecting him to do an exciting film that would correspond to his <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(radio)" title="The War of the Worlds (radio)">The War of the Worlds</a>
				</i> radio broadcast. Welles' RKO contract had given him complete control over the
				production of the film when he signed on with the studio, something that he never
				again was allowed to exercise when making motion pictures.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film scholars and historians view <i>Citizen
					Kane</i> as Welles' attempt to create a new style of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking" title="Filmmaking">filmmaking</a>
				by studying various forms of movie making, and combining them all into one. The most
				innovative technical aspect of <i>Citizen Kane</i> is the extended use of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_focus" title="Deep focus">deep focus</a>. In nearly every scene in the film, the
				foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. This was
				done by renowned cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Toland" title="Gregg Toland">Gregg
					Toland</a> through his experimentation with lenses and lighting. Specifically,
				Toland often used telephoto lenses to shoot close-up scenes. Any time deep focus was
				impossible — for example in the scene when Kane finishes a bad review of Alexander's
				opera while at the same time firing the person who started the review — Toland used
				an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_printer" title="Optical printer">optical printer</a> to make the whole screen appear in
				focus (visually layering one piece of film onto another). However, some apparently
				deep-focus shots were the result of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-camera_effect" title="In-camera effect">in-camera effects</a>, as in the famous example of the scene where Kane breaks
				into Susan Alexander's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and
				another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a
				glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera
				matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the
				background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot
				with the background action.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another unorthodox method used in the film was
				the way <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-angle_shot" title="Low-angle shot">low-angle shots</a> were used to display a point of view
				facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several
				scenes. Since movies were primarily filmed on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_stage" title="Sound stage">sound
					stages</a> and not on location during the era of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>
				<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system" title="Studio system">studio system</a>, it was impossible to film at an angle
				that showed ceilings because the stages had none. In some instances, Welles' crew
				used <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslin" title="Muslin">muslin</a> draped above the set to produce the illusion of a regular room with
				a ceiling, while the boom mikes were hidden above the cloth.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the story-telling techniques introduced
				in this film was using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters
				changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would
				look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous
				cut. In this way, Welles chronicled the breakdown of Kane's first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage" title="Marriage">marriage</a>, which took years of story time, in a matter of minutes.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles also pioneered several visual effects in
				order to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For
				example, the scene where the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the
				rafters to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for the second Mrs.
				Kane's performance was shot by panning a camera upwards over the performance scene,
				then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then
				another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of the workmen. Other scenes
				effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it
				truly was, such as various shots of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanadu_(Citizen_Kane)" title="Xanadu (Citizen Kane)">Xanadu</a>. A loud, full screen closeup of the
				typewriter typing a single word magnifies the review for the <i>Chicago
				Inquirer</i>—"weak".</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film broke new ground with its use of
				special effects makeup, created by makeup artist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maurice_Seiderman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Maurice Seiderman (page does not exist)">Maurice Seiderman</a>,
				believably aging the cast many decades over the course of the story.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles brought his experience with sound from
				radio along to filmmaking, producing a layered and complex soundtrack. In one scene,
				the elderly Kane strikes Susan in a tent on the beach, and the two characters
				silently glower at each other while a woman at the nearby party can be heard
				hysterically laughing in the background, her giddiness in grotesque counterpoint to
				the misery of Susan and Kane. Elsewhere, Welles skillfully employed reverberation to
				create a mood, such as the chilly echo of the monumental Thatcher library, where the
				reporter is confronted by an intimidating, officious librarian.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to expanding on the potential of
				sound as a creator of moods and emotions, Welles pioneered a new aural technique,
				known as the "lightning-mix". Welles used this technique to link complex <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing" title="Film editing">montage</a> sequences via a series of related sounds or
				phrases. In offering a continuous sound track, Welles was able to join what would
				otherwise be extremely rough cuts together into a smooth narrative. For example, the
				audience witnesses Kane grow from a child into a young man in just two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_(film)" title="Shot (film)">shots</a>. As Kane's guardian hands him his sled, Kane
				begrudingly wishes him a "Merry Christmas". Suddenly we are taken to a shot of his
				guardian fifteen years later, only to have the phrase completed for us: "and a Happy
				New Year". In this case, the continuity of the soundtrack, not the image, is what
				makes for a seamless narrative structure.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles also carried over techniques from radio
				not yet popular in the movies (though they would become staples). Using a number of
				voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and
				splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, the result gave the impression
				of a whole town talking - and, equally important, what the town was talking about.
				Welles also favored the overlapping of dialogue, considering it more realistic than
				the stage and movie tradition of characters not stepping on each other's sentences.
				He also pioneered the technique of putting the audio ahead of the visual in scene
				transitions (an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-cut" title="L-cut">L-cut</a>); as a scene would come to a close, the audio would
				transition to the next scene before the visuals did.</p>
			<wiki:career>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In common with using personnel he had
					previously worked with in the Mercury Theatre, Welles recruited his close friend
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a> to score Citizen Kane.
					Herrmann was longtime collaborator of Welles, providing music for several radio
					broadcasts including the <i>War of the Worlds</i> broadcast. The film was
					Herrmann's first motion picture score and would be nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Original_Music_Score" title="Academy Award for Original Music Score">Academy Award for Original
						Music Score</a> but would lose out to his own score for the film <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_and_Daniel_Webster_(1941_film)" title="The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941 film)">All That Money Can
							Buy</a>
					</i>.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herrmann's score for Citizen Kane was a
					watershed in film soundtrack composition and proved as influential as any of the
					films other innovations and established him as an important voice in film
					soundtrack composition. The score eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of
					scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he
					later described as '"radio scoring", musical cues which typically lasted between
					five and fifteen seconds to bridge the action or suggest a different emotional
					response. In the opening sequence, the tour of Kane's estate, Xanadu, Herrmann
					introduces a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotiv" title="Leitmotiv">leitmotiv</a> which reoccurs throughout the film. Much of
					the music used in the newsreel was taken from other sources,examples include the
						<i>News on the March</i> music which was taken from RKO's music library,
						<i>Belgian March</i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Vincent_Collins" title="Anthony Vincent Collins">Anthony Collins</a> accompanies the newsreel

					exploration of Xanadu. In the final sequence of the film, which shows the
					destruction of Rosebud in the fireplace of Kane’s castle, Welles choreographed
					the scene while he had Herrmann’s cue playing on the set.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the famous operatic sequence which
					exposed Kane's protege Susan Alexander for the amateur she was, Herrmann created
					a brand new piece <i>The Aria from Salammbó</i>. An original piece was used as
					there is no major opera where the female soprano leads off. Herrmann put the
					Aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes,
					culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Alexander. Herrmann said he
					wanted to convey the impression of <i>a terrified girl floundering in the
						quicksand of a powerful orchestra</i>. On the soundtrack it was soprano <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jean_Forward&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Jean Forward (page does not exist)">Jean Forward</a> who actually
					sang the vocal part for actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Comingore" title="Dorothy Comingore">Dorothy Comingore</a>.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1972 Herrmann said "I was fortunate to
					start my career with a film like <i>Citizen Kane</i>, it's been a downhill run
					ever since!". Shortly before his death in 1985, Welles told director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Jaglom" title="Henry Jaglom">Henry Jaglom</a> that that the score was fifty per cent
					responsible for the film’s artistic success. </p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, Herrmann was vocal in his criticism
					of Pauline Kael's claim not only on her position that it was Mankiewicz, not
					Welles, who made the main thrust of the film but also in her assumptions about
					the use of music in the film without consulting him:</p>

					"metaphysical detective story," in that "... [its] subject (both psychological
					and allegorical) is the investigation of a man's inner self, through the works
					he has wrought, the words he has spoken, the many lives he has ruined..." Borges
					noted that "Overwhelmingly, endlessly, Orson Welles shows fragments of the life
					of the man, Charles Foster Kane, and invites us to combine them and reconstruct
					him." As well, "Forms of multiplicity and incongruity abound in the film: the
					first scenes record the treasures amassed by Kane; in one of the last, a poor
					woman, luxuriant and suffering, plays with an enormous jigsaw puzzle on the
					floor of a palace that is also a museum." Borges points out, "At the end we
					realize that the fragments are not governed by a secret unity: the detested
					Charles Foster Kane is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacrum" title="Simulacrum">simulacrum</a>, a chaos of appearances."</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite numerous positive reviews from

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hearing about the film enraged Hearst so much
				that he offered RKO Pictures $800,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the
				negative. Although it is often said that Hearst was upset because the film was about
				him, one alternative theory is that Hearst was more upset about the portrayal of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Davies" title="Marion Davies">Marion Davies</a> (as singer Susan Alexander) than himself
				in the film.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When RKO rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the
				film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from
				reviewing - or even mentioning - the movie. The documentary <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_Over_Citizen_Kane" title="The Battle Over Citizen Kane">The Battle Over Citizen Kane</a>
				</i> lays the blame for <i>Citizen Kane's</i> relative failure squarely at the feet
				of Hearst. Even though it did decent business at the box-office and went on to be
				the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, this fell short of its
				creators' expectations but was still acceptable to its backers. In <i>The Chief: The
					Life of William Randolph Hearst,</i> David Nasaw points out that Hearst's
				actions were not the only reason <i>Kane</i> failed, however: the innovations Welles
				made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the
				pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not
				appreciate its merits (Nasaw, 572-573).</p>

				night and told him: "Do not go to your hotel room tonight; Hearst has set up an
				undressed,underage girl to leap into your arms when you enter and a photographer to
				take pictures of you. Hearst is planning to publish it in all of his papers". Welles
				thanked the man and stayed out all night. However, it is not confirmed whether this
				was true. Welles also described his only meeting with William Randolph Hearst: in an
				elevator in a building in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Hearst's efforts to suppress it damaged
				the film's success, they <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect" title="Streisand effect">backfired in the long run</a>, since almost every reference of Hearst's life

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite its status, <i>Citizen Kane</i> is
					not entirely without its critics. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University" title="Boston University">Boston University</a> film scholar <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Carney" title="Ray Carney">Ray Carney</a>, although noting its technical
					achievements, criticized what he saw as the film's lack of emotional depth,
					shallow characterization and empty metaphors. Listing it among the most
					overrated works within the film community, he accused the film of being "an
					all-American triumph of style over substance... indistinguishable from the opera
					production within it: attempting to conceal the banality of its performances by
					wrapping them in a thousand layers of acoustic and visual processing". Of its
					director, he went on to state, "Welles <i>is</i> Kane — in a sense he couldn't
					have intended — substituting razzle-dazzle for truth and hoping no one notices
					the sleight of hand". He also criticized critics and scholars of allowing
					themselves to be pandered to, stating "critics obviously enjoy being told what
					to think or they'd never sit still for the hammy acting, cartoon
					characterizations, tendentious photography, editorializing blockings, and
					absurdly grandiose (and annoyingly insistent) metaphors....When will film
					studies grow up? Even <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedediah_Leland" title="Jedediah Leland">Jedediah Leland</a>, the opera reviewer in the film, knew better than to be

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles' original master film negative of

The current US DVD
				version (released by Warner Home Video) is taken from another digital restoration,
				supervised by Turner. The transfer to Region 1 DVD has been criticised by some film
				experts for being too bright. Also, in the scene in Bernstein's office (chapter 10)
				rain falling outside the window has been digitally erased, probably because it was
				thought to be excessive film grain. These alterations are not present in the UK
				Region 2, which is also considered to be more accurate in terms of contrast and
				brightness.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2003, Orson Welles' daughter Beatrice sued
				Turner Entertainment and RKO Pictures, claiming that the Welles estate is the legal
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> holder of the film. Her attorney said that Orson
				Welles had left RKO with an exit deal terminating his contracts with the studio,
				meaning that Welles still had an interest in the film and his previous contract
				giving the studio the copyright of the film was null and void. Beatrice Welles also
				claimed that, if the courts did not uphold her claim of copyright, RKO nevertheless
				owed the estate 20% of the profits, from a previous contract which has not been
				lived up to.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_30" title="May 30">May 30</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007" title="2007">2007</a>,
				the appeals panel agreed that Beatrice Welles could proceed with the lawsuit against
				Turner Entertainment, the opinion partially overturns the 2004 decision by a lower
				court judge who had found in favor of Turner Entertainment on the issue of video
				rights.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1980s, this film became the catalyst in
				the controversy over the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_colorization" title="Film colorization">colorization</a> of black and white films. When Ted Turner told members of the
				press that he was considering colorizing <i>Citizen Kane</i>, his comments led to an
				immediate public outcry. Welles supposedly told friends that he intended to "keep
				Ted Turner and his goddamned Crayolas away from my movie." The uproar was for
				naught, as Turner Pictures had never actually announced that this was an upcoming
				planned project. Turner later claimed that this was a joke designed to needle
				colorization critics, and that he had never had any intention of colorizing the
				film. Turner could not have colorized the film had he wanted to. Welles' original
				contract prevented any alteration to the film without his, and eventually his
				estate's, express consent.</p>
