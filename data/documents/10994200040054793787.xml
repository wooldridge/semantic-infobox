	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana,_Pennsylvania" title="Indiana, Pennsylvania">Indiana, Pennsylvania</a>, the son of Elizabeth Ruth (nÃ©e Jackson) and Alexander Maitland Stewart, who owned a hardware store. Stewart's parents were of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people" title="Scottish people">Scottish</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> origin. His Jackson ancestors served in the American Revolution, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a> and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. The eldest of three children (he had two younger sisters, Virginia and Mary), he was expected to continue his father's business, which had been in the family for three generations.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His mother was an excellent pianist but his father discouraged Stewart's request for lessons. But when his father accepted a gift of an accordion from a guest, young Stewart quickly learned to play the instrument, which became a fixture off-stage during his acting career. As the family grew, music continued to be an important part of family life.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercersburg_Academy" title="Mercersburg Academy">Mercersburg Academy</a> prep school, graduating in 1928. At Mercersburg, Stewart was active in a variety of activities. He played on the football and track teams. He was art editor for the <i>KARUX</i> yearbook and member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir" title="Choir">choir</a> club, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(music)" title="Glee (music)">glee</a> club, and John Marshall Literary Society. During his first summer break, Stewart returned to Indiana, Pennsylvania to work as a brick loader for a local construction company and on highway and road construction jobs where he painted lines on the roads. Over the following two summers, he took a job as an assistant with a professional magician. He also made his first appearance on the stage at Mercersburg, as Buquet in the play <i>The Wolves</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A shy child, Stewart spent much of his after-school time in the basement working on model airplanes, mechanical drawing and chemistryâ€”all with a dream of going into aviation. But he abandoned visions of being a pilot when his father insisted that instead of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy" title="United States Naval Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> he attend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart enrolled at Princeton in 1928 as a member of the Class of 1932. He excelled at studying <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, so impressing his professors with his thesis on an airport design that he was awarded a scholarship for graduate studies, but he gradually became attracted to the school's drama and music clubs, including the famous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Triangle_Club" title="Princeton Triangle Club">Princeton Triangle Club</a>. He was a member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Charter_Club" title="Princeton Charter Club">Princeton Charter Club</a> as well as a head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleading" title="Cheerleading">cheerleader</a>. In his spare time, he enjoyed going to the movies at the time when '<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkies" title="Talkies">talkies</a>' were just displacing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_films" title="Silent films">silent films</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His acting and accordion talents at Princeton led him to be invited to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Players" title="University Players">University Players</a>, an intercollegiate summer stock company in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Falmouth" title="West Falmouth">West Falmouth</a>, a town on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod" title="Cape Cod">Cape Cod</a>, Massachusetts. This company had been organized in 1928 and would run until 1932, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Logan" title="Joshua Logan">Joshua Logan</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretaigne_Windust" title="Bretaigne Windust">Bretaigne Windust</a>, and Charles Leatherbee as the directors. Stewart performed in bit parts in the Players' productions in Cape Cod during the Summer of 1932 after he graduated. The troupe had previously included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, who married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sullavan" title="Margaret Sullavan">Margaret Sullavan</a> on Christmas Day 1931 while the University Players were located in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore" title="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> for an 18-week winter season. Sullavan, who had rejoined the University Players in Baltimore in November 1931 at the close of the post-Broadway tour of <i>A Modern Virgin</i>, left the Players for good at the end of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_of_Mary_Dugan" title="The Trial of Mary Dugan">The Trial of Mary Dugan</a></i> in Baltimore in March 1932. By the time Stewart joined the University Players on Cape Cod after his graduation from Princeton in 1932, Fonda and Sullavan's brief marriage had ended. Stewart and Fonda became great friends over the summer of 1932 when they shared an apartment with Joshua Logan and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_McCormick" title="Myron McCormick">Myron McCormick</a>. When he came to New York at the end of the summer stock season, which had included the Broadway try-out of <i>Goodbye Again</i>, he shared an apartment with Henry Fonda, who had by then finalized his divorce from Sullavan. Along with fellow University Players <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Dalrymple&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Alfred Dalrymple (page does not exist)">Alfred Dalrymple</a> and Myron McCormick, Stewart debuted on Broadway as a chauffeur in the comedy <i>Goodbye Again</i>, in which he had two lines. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i> noted, "Mr. James Stewart's chauffeur... comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of spontaneous applause."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The play was a moderate success, but times were hard. Many Broadway theaters had been converted to movie houses and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Depression</a> was reaching bottom. "From 1932 through 1934," Stewart later recalled, "I'd only worked three months. Every play I got into folded." By 1934, he got more substantial stage roles, including the modest hit <i>Page Miss Glory</i> and his first dramatic stage role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Howard" title="Sidney Howard">Sidney Howard</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Jack_(play_and_film)" title="Yellow Jack (play and film)">Yellow Jack</a></i>, which convinced him to continue his acting career. However, Stewart and Fonda, still roommates, were both struggling.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the fall of 1934, Fonda's success in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farmer_Takes_a_Wife" title="The Farmer Takes a Wife">The Farmer Takes a Wife</a></i> took him to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. Finally, Stewart attracted the interest of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> scout Bill Grady who saw Stewart on the opening night of <i>Divided by Three</i>, a glittering premiÃ¨re with many luminaries in attendance, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Berlin" title="Irving Berlin">Irving Berlin</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss_Hart" title="Moss Hart">Moss Hart</a> and Fonda, who had returned to New York for the show. With Fonda's encouragement, Stewart agreed to take a screen test, after which he signed a contract with MGM in April 1935, as a contract player for up to seven years at $350 a week.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On his arrival by train to Los Angeles, Fonda greeted Stewart at the station and took him to Fonda's studio-supplied lodging, next door to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo" title="Greta Garbo">Greta Garbo</a>. His first job at the studio was as a participant in screen tests with newly-arrived starlets. At first, he had trouble being cast in Hollywood films owing to his gangling looks and shy, humble screen presence. His first film was the poorly received <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> vehicle, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murder_Man" title="The Murder Man">The Murder Man</a></i> (1935), but <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Marie_(films)" title="Rose Marie (films)">Rose Marie</a></i> (1936), an adaptation of a popular operetta, was more successful. After mixed success in films, he received his first substantial part in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_in_film" title="1936 in film">1936</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_the_Thin_Man" title="After the Thin Man">After the Thin Man</a>.</i></p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the romantic front, he found himself dating newly divorced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Rogers" title="Ginger Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a>, whom he had revered while a student at Princeton only a few years earlier. The romance soon cooled, however, and by chance Stewart encountered Margaret Sullavan again. Stewart found his footing in Hollywood thanks largely to Sullavan, who campaigned for Stewart to be her leading man in the 1936 romantic comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Time_We_Love" title="Next Time We Love">Next Time We Love</a></i>. She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his confidence. She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style. In the meantime, roommate Fonda continued to arrange parties with starlets, who found Stewart different from the other young actors and irresistible in his own way. Stewart was enjoying Hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage, as he worked six days a week in the MGM factory. In 1936, he acquired big-time agent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Hayward" title="Leland Hayward">Leland Hayward</a>, who would eventually marry Margaret Sullavan. Hayward started to chart Stewart's career, deciding the best path for him was through loan-outs to other studios.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1938, Stewart had a brief, tumultuous, and well-publicized romance with Hollywood queen <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Shearer" title="Norma Shearer">Norma Shearer</a> whose husband <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a>, head of production at MGM, had died two years earlier. Stewart began a successful partnership with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank Capra</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_in_film" title="1938 in film">1938</a>, when he was loaned out to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> to star in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can%27t_Take_It_With_You_(film)" title="You Can't Take It With You (film)">You Can't Take It With You</a></i>. Frank Capra had been impressed by Stewart's minor role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Blue_and_Gold_(film)" title="Navy Blue and Gold (film)">Navy Blue and Gold</a></i> (1937). The director had recently completed several popular movies including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Happened_One_Night" title="It Happened One Night">It Happened One Night</a></i> (1934) and was looking for the right type of actor to suit his needsâ€”which other recent actors in his films such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Colman" title="Ronald Colman">Ronald Colman</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart just what he was looking for, but Capra also found Stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very little directing. Later Capra commented, "I think he's probably the best actor who's ever hit the screen."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This heart-warming Depression-era film <i>(You Can't Take It With You)</i>, starring Capra's "favorite actress", comedienne <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Arthur" title="Jean Arthur">Jean Arthur</a>, won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_in_film" title="1938 in film">1938</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a>.

Stewart replaced intended star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> in the film featuring an idealistic man who is thrown into the political arena. Upon the film's October 1939 release, it garnered critical praise and became a box office success. For his performance, Stewart was nominated for the first of five <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Best Actor</a>. Even after this great success, Stewart's parents were still trying to talk him into leaving Hollywood and its sinful ways and to return to his home town to lead a decent life.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1940, Stewart and Margaret Sullavan reunited for two films. The first, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Lubitsch" title="Ernst Lubitsch">Ernst Lubitsch</a> romantic comedy, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shop_Around_the_Corner" title="The Shop Around the Corner">The Shop Around the Corner</a></i>, starred Stewart and Sullavan as co-workers unknowingly involved in a pen-pal romance who cannot stand each other in real life (this was later remade into the musical, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Good_Old_Summertime" title="In the Good Old Summertime">In the Good Old Summertime</a></i> with Judy Garland and Van Johnson, and later as the romantic comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27ve_Got_Mail" title="You've Got Mail">You've Got Mail</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks" title="Tom Hanks">Tom Hanks</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg_Ryan" title="Meg Ryan">Meg Ryan</a>).

Stewart thought his performance "entertaining and slick and smooth" but lacking the "guts" of "Mr. Smith." Stewart gave the Oscar statuette to his father, who displayed it for many years in a case inside the front door of his hardware store, alongside other family awards and military medals.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the months before he began military service, Stewart appeared in a series of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screwball_comedy" title="Screwball comedy">screwball comedies</a> with varying levels of success.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Stewart family had deep military roots as both grandfathers had fought in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, and his father had served during both the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish-American_War" title="Spanish-American War">Spanish-American War</a> and World War I. Since Stewart considered his father to be the biggest influence on his life, it was not surprising that when another war eventually came, he too served. Although members of his family had previously served in the infantry, Stewart chose to become a military flyer.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An early interest in flying led Stewart to gain his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Pilot_License" title="Private Pilot License">Private Pilot certificate</a> in 1935 and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Pilot_Licence" title="Commercial Pilot Licence">Commercial Pilot certificate</a> in 1938. He often flew cross-country to visit his parents in Pennsylvania, navigating by the railroad tracks. Nearly two years before the December 1941 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, Stewart had accumulated over 400 hours of flying time.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considered a highly proficient pilot, he even entered a cross-country race as a co-pilot in 1939. Along with musician/composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoagy_Carmichael" title="Hoagy Carmichael">Hoagy Carmichael</a>, seeing the need for trained war pilots, Stewart joined with other Hollywood celebrities to invest in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbird_Field" title="Thunderbird Field">Thunderbird Field</a>, a pilot training school built and operated by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airways" title="Southwest Airways">Southwest Airways</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale,_Arizona" title="Glendale, Arizona">Glendale, Arizona</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later in 1940, Stewart was drafted into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> but was rejected for failing to meet height and weight requirements for new recruitsâ€”Stewart was five pounds (2.3Â kg) under the standard. To get up to 148 pounds he sought out the help of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's muscle man, Don Loomis, who was noted for his ability to add or subtract pounds in his studio gymnasium. Stewart subsequently attempted to enlist in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Corps" title="United States Army Air Corps">Army Air Corps</a>, but still came in under the weight requirement, although he persuaded the AAC enlistment officer to run new tests, this time passing the weigh-in, with the result that Stewart enlisted in the Army in March 1941. He became the first major American movie star to wear a military uniform in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart enlisted as a private and began pilot training in the USAAC. During this time the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, bringing the US into direct involvement in the war. Stewart continued his military training and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in January, 1942. He was posted to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Field" title="Moffett Field">Moffett Field</a> and then <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mather_Field" title="Mather Field">Mather Field</a> as an instructor pilot in single- and twin-engine aircraft.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Public appearances by Stewart were limited engagements scheduled by the Army Air Forces.

In early 1942, Stewart was asked to appear in a propaganda film to help recruit the anticipated 100,000 airmen the USAAF would need to win the war. The USAAF's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Motion_Picture_Unit" title="First Motion Picture Unit">First Motion Picture Unit</a> shot scenes of Lieutenant Stewart in his pilot's flight suit and recorded his voice for narration.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart was concerned that his expertise and celebrity status would relegate him to instructor duties "behind the lines." His fears were confirmed when he was stationed for six months at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtland_Air_Force_Base" title="Kirtland Air Force Base">Kirtland Air Force Base</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico" title="Albuquerque, New Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a> to train bombardiers.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">"Still, the war was moving on. For the 36-year-old Stewart, combat duty seemed far away and unreachable and he had no clear plans for the future. But then a rumor that Stewart would be taken off flying status and assigned to making training films or selling bonds called for his immediate and decisive action, because what he dreaded most was the hope-shattering spectre of a dead end." Stewart appealed to his commander, a pre-war aviator, who understood the situation and reassigned him to a unit going overseas.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In August 1943 he was finally assigned to the 445th Bombardment Group at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Gateway_Airport" title="Sioux Gateway Airport">Sioux City AAB</a>, Iowa, first as Operations Officer of the 703rd Bombardment Squadron and then as its commander, at the rank of Captain.

As a means to inspire his new group, Stewart flew as command pilot in the lead B-24 on numerous missions deep into Nazi-occupied Europe. These missions went <i>uncounted</i> at Stewart's orders. His "official" total is listed as 20 and is limited to those with the 445th. In 1944, he twice received the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_States)" title="Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> for actions in combat and was awarded the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croix_de_Guerre" title="Croix de Guerre">Croix de Guerre</a>.

Before the war ended, he was promoted to colonel, one of very few Americans to rise from private to colonel in four years.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the beginning of June 1945, Stewart was the presiding officer of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court-martial" title="Court-martial">court-martial</a> of a pilot and navigator who were charged with dereliction of duty when they <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombings_of_Switzerland_in_World_War_II#Zurich_and_Basel" title="Bombings of Switzerland in World War II">accidentally bombed the Swiss city of Zurich</a> the previous Marchâ€”the first instance of U.S. personnel being tried over an attack on a neutral country.

Stewart did not often talk of his wartime service, perhaps due to his desire to be seen as a regular soldier doing his duty instead of as a celebrity. He did appear on the TV series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_At_War" title="The World At War">The World At War</a></i> to discuss the October 14, 1943 bombing mission to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schweinfurt" title="Schweinfurt">Schweinfurt</a>, which was the center of the German ball bearing manufacturing industry. This mission is known in USAF history as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Raid_on_Schweinfurt" title="Second Raid on Schweinfurt">Black Thursday</a></i> due to the high casualties it sustained; 60 aircraft were lost out of 291 dispatched, as the raid consisting entirely of B-17s was unescorted to Schweinfurt and back due to the available escort aircraft lacking the range. Upon his request, he was identified only as "James Stewart, Squadron Commander" in the documentary.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He served as Air Force Reserve commander of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbins_Air_Reserve_Base" title="Dobbins Air Reserve Base">Dobbins Air Reserve Base</a> in the early 1950s.

His former agent Leland Hayward got out of the talent business in 1944 after selling his A-list of stars, including Stewart, to MCA.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">James Stewart's collaborations with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mann" title="Anthony Mann">Anthony Mann</a> increased Stewart's popularity and sent his career into the realm of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_movie" title="Western movie">western</a>.

In choosing Mann (after first choice <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Lang" title="Fritz Lang">Fritz Lang</a> declined), Stewart cemented a powerful partnership. The film, which became a massive box office hit upon its release, set the pattern for their future collaborations. In it, Stewart is a tough, revengeful sharpshooter, the winner of a prized rifle which is stolen and then passes through many hands, until the showdown between Stewart and his brother (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_McNally" title="Stephen McNally">Stephen McNally</a>).</p>

Frequently, the films featured Stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption, while facing corrupt cattlemen, ranchers and outlawsâ€”a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it. Their collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the 1950s and remain popular today for their grittier, more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre. Audiences saw Stewart's screen persona evolve into a more mature, more ambiguous, and edgier presence.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart and Mann also collaborated on other films outside the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_movie" title="Western movie">western</a> genre. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_in_film" title="1953 in film">1953</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glenn_Miller_Story" title="The Glenn Miller Story">The Glenn Miller Story</a></i> was critically acclaimed, garnering Stewart a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award" title="BAFTA Award">BAFTA Award</a> nomination, and (together with <i>The Spirit of St. Louis</i>) cemented the popularity of Stewart's portrayals of 'American heroes'. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_Bay_(film)" title="Thunder Bay (film)">Thunder Bay</a></i>, released the same year, transplanted the plot arch of their western collaborations in the present day, with Stewart as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> oil-driller facing corruption. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command_(film)" title="Strategic Air Command (film)">Strategic Air Command</a></i>, released in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_in_film" title="1955 in film">1955</a>, allowed Stewart to use his experiences in the United States Air Force on film.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart's starring role in <i>Winchester '73</i> was also a turning point in Hollywood. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a>, who wanted Stewart to appear in both that film and <i>Harvey,</i> balked at his $200,000 asking price. Stewart's agent, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Wasserman" title="Lew Wasserman">Lew Wasserman</a>, brokered an alternate deal, in which Stewart would appear in both films for no pay, in exchange for a percentage of the profits and cast and director approval.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This wasn't the first such deal at Universal; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_and_Costello" title="Abbott and Costello">Abbott and Costello</a> also had a profit participation contract, but they were no longer top-flight moneymakers by 1950. Stewart ended up earning about $600,000 for <i>Winchester '73</i> alone.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second collaboration to define Stewart's career in the 1950s was with acclaimed mystery and suspense director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>. Like Mann, Hitchcock uncovered new depths to Stewart's acting, showing a protagonist confronting his fears and his repressed desires. Stewart's first movie with Hitchcock was the technologically innovative <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_in_film" title="1948 in film">1948</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(film)" title="Rope (film)">Rope</a></i>, shot in long "real time" takes.</p>

Limited by his wheelchair, Stewart is masterfully led by Hitchcock to react to what his character sees with mostly facial responses.

Stewart's nomination was one of seven for the film (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Heston" title="Charlton Heston">Charlton Heston</a> was the winner), and saw his transition into the final decades of his career.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On January 1, 1960 Stewart received the devastating news that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sullavan" title="Margaret Sullavan">Margaret Sullavan</a> had committed suicide, most likely over despondency from her loss of hearing and its effect on her stage career.

At story's end, Stewart's characterâ€”now a rising political figureâ€”faces a difficult ethical choice as he attempts to reconcile his actions with his personal integrity. The film's billing is unusual in that Stewart was given top billing over Wayne in the trailers and on the posters but Wayne had top billing in the film itself, a system later repeated by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_President%27s_Men_(film)" title="All the President's Men (film)">All the President's Men</a></i>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Henry Fonda moved to Hollywood in 1934, he was again a roommate with Stewart in an apartment in Brentwood and the two gained a reputation as playboys.

The story is about a man whose best friend is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%BAca" title="PÃºca">pooka</a> named Harveyâ€”in the form of a six-foot, three-and-one-half-inch tall rabbit.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elwood P. Dowd (Stewart) is a middle-aged, amiable (and somewhat eccentric) individual whose best friend is an invisible 6'3.5" tall <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit" title="Rabbit">rabbit</a> named Harvey. As described by Dowd, Harvey is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%BAca" title="PÃºca">pooka</a>, a benign but mischievous creature from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_mythology" title="Celtic mythology">Celtic mythology</a> who is especially fond of social outcasts (like Elwood). Elwood has driven his sister and niece (who live with him and crave normality and a place in 'society') to distraction by introducing everyone he meets to his friend, Harvey. His family seems to be unsure whether Dowd's obsession with Harvey is a product of his (admitted) propensity to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_problem" title="Drinking problem">drink</a> or perhaps <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness" title="Mental illness">mental illness</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His sister, Veta Louise Simmons (Hull), tries to have Elwood committed to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanatorium" title="Sanatorium">sanatorium</a>. In exasperation, she admits to the attending <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> (Dr. Lyman Sanderson, played by Charles Drake) that, after so many years of putting up with the invisible rabbit, she sees Harvey every once in a while. This causes Dr. Sanderson to let Elwood out and lock Veta up. After sorting out the mistake, Dr. Chumley, head of the sanatorium (Cecil Kellaway) decides that to save the reputation of the sanatorium he must bring Elwood back. At one point, when her daughter asks how someone possibly could imagine a rabbit, Veta says to her "Myrtle Mae, you have a lot to learn and I hope you never learn it."</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dr. Sanderson convinces Elwood to come into his office where he'll receive a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug" title="Drug">serum</a> that will stop Dowd from "seeing the rabbit". As they are preparing for the injection, Elwood's sister is told by their cab driver about all the other people he has driven to the sanatorium to receive the same medicine, warning her that Elwood will become "just a normal human being. And you know what stinkers they are." Upset by the very thought of this, Veta halts the procedure by banging on the examining room door, at which point Elwood comforts her and explains her tears to others with, "Veta's had a big day."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the tale's end Harvey is given the choice of remaining with Dr. Chumley (and spending two weeks with him in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio" title="Akron, Ohio">Akron, Ohio</a>) or continuing his life with Elwood. The rabbit catches up with Elwood at the exit to the sanatorium, the gate is seen opening as Harvey follows the others out (Harvey's existence is confirmed earlier in the film when a character looks up Pooka in a dictionary and finds he is addressed by name in the definition).</p>
