Simultaneously, the police assign undercover cop Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, each man attempts to discover the other's true identity before their cover is blown.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At a young age, Colin Sullivan (Damon) is introduced to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime" title="Organized crime">organized crime</a> through Irish mobster Frank Costello (Nicholson) in the Irish neighborhood of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Boston" title="South Boston">Southie</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston" title="Boston">Boston</a>. Costello trains him to become his mole inside the Massachusetts State Police. Sullivan is accepted into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Investigations_Unit" title="Special Investigations Unit">Special Investigations Unit</a> (SIU), which focuses on organized crime. Before he graduates from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_academy" title="Police academy">police academy</a>, Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is asked by Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg) to become an undercover agent, as his childhood and family ties to organized crime make him a perfect infiltrator. He drops out of the academy and does time in prison on a fake assault charge to increase his credibility.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As both infiltrate their respective organizations, Sullivan begins a romance with psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Farmiga). Costigan sees her for his probation and also develops a relationship with her. Shortly after, Costigan makes love to her before she moves in with Sullivan. After Costello barely escapes a sting operation, both moles become aware of the other's existence (though not his identity). Sullivan is told to find the "rat" and asks Costello for his crew's information to determine who is the informer within Costello's crew. Costigan follows Costello into a movie theater where Costello gives Sullivan an envelope with the details. Costigan then chases Sullivan through Boston's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Boston" title="Chinatown, Boston">Chinatown</a>, during which Sullivan pulls out a pocket knife and stabs an innocent bystander in the stomach. When it is over, both men still do not know each other's identity. Sullivan then has Queenan tailed as he meets Costigan in an abandoned building. Sullivan sends Costello's men in and Queenan distracts them to let Costigan escape. He is thrown from the roof and dies at the feet of Costigan, who is covered in some of Queenan's blood. When the mobsters escape, Costigan pretends he has come to rejoin them. The trailing state troopers open fire on Costello's crew, which causes casualties on both sides. Later, at one of Costello's safe houses, Delahunt (one of Costello's enforcers) tells Costigan "I gave you the wrong address--but you went to the right one" but then asks him if he knows why he didn't say anything about before dying. When Costello's henchman, Fitzgibbons, known as "Fitzy," (O'Hara) does an unsuccessful job of hiding Delahunt's corpse, it's revealed that Delahunt was also an undercover cop with the Boston PD. Costello says, "They're saying he's a cop so I won't look for the cop."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Now under scrutiny, Sullivan is attacked by a suspicious Dignam because of Queenan's death. Captain George Ellerby (Baldwin) places Dignam on leave. Using Queenan's bloody phone, Sullivan reaches Costigan, who refuses to abort his mission. Sullivan learns of Costello's role as an informant for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> from Queenan's diary, causing him to worry about his dual identity being revealed. With Costigan's help, Costello is tracked to a cocaine drop-off, where he and his crew become trapped in a gunfight with police, resulting in most of the mobsters being killed. As Costello attempts an escape he is confronted by Sullivan. Costello admits he is an occasional FBI mole and tries to shoot, but Sullivan fires first fatally hitting him, then when Costello tries to shoot him again Sullivan shoots him multiple times, killing him. With Costello dead, Sullivan is applauded the next day by everyone on the force. In good faith, Costigan comes to him for restoration of his true identity, but notices an envelope containing details of Costello's men on Sullivan's desk and flees. Knowing he has been found out, Sullivan erases all records of Costigan from the police computer system.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan and Madolyn stand at the grave. She is clearly distraught. Sullivan attempts to discuss the future of her child, but she ignores him. Later, Sullivan enters his apartment with groceries, and to his surprise finds Dignam waiting for him, wearing hospital footies and surgical gloves to leave no trace of his presence and aiming a silenced pistol straight at him. Aware of Sullivan's treachery, Dignam shoots him in the temple. As Sullivan collapses dead, Dignam calmly exits Sullivan's apartment. A rat crawls along the apartment balcony, with the view of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_State_House" title="Massachusetts State House">Massachusetts State House</a> in the background.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The father-son relationship is a motif throughout the film. Costello acts as a father figure to both Colin and Billy while Queenan acts as Costello's foil in the role of father-figure presenting both sides of the Irish-American father archetype. Colin refers to Costello as 'Dad' whenever he calls him to inform him of police activities.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Departed</i> was highly anticipated when it was released on October 6, 2006 to overwhelmingly positive reviews.

He went on to compare the film favorably to the onslaught of banality offered by American studios in recent years. "The movies have been in the doldrums lately. <i>The Departed</i> is a much needed tonic," he wrote.

Lau pointed out that the remake featured some of the "golden quotes" of the original but did have much more swearing. He ultimately rated <i>The Departed</i> 8/10 and said that the Hollywood remake is worth a view, though "the effect of combining the two female characters in the [later film] into one isn't as good as in the original," according to Lau's spokeswoman Alice Tam.</p>
