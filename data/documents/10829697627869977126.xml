      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, Jolie is the daughter of actors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Voight" title="Jon Voight">Jon Voight</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcheline_Bertrand" title="Marcheline Bertrand">Marcheline Bertrand</a>. She is the niece of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Taylor" title="Chip Taylor">Chip Taylor</a>, sister of James Haven and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddaughter" title="Goddaughter">goddaughter</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Bisset" title="Jacqueline Bisset">Jacqueline Bisset</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_Schell" title="Maximilian Schell">Maximilian Schell</a>. On her father's side, Jolie is of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_people" title="Slovak people">Slovak</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-Americans" title="German-Americans">German</a> descent, and on her mother's side she is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Canadian" title="French Canadian">French Canadian</a> and is said to be part <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois" title="Iroquois">Iroquois</a>. However, Voight has claimed Bertrand was "not seriously Iroquois", and they merely said it to enhance his ex-wife's exotic background.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother were raised by their mother, who abandoned her acting ambitions and moved with them to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades,_New_York" title="Palisades, New York">Palisades, New York</a>. As a child, Jolie regularly saw movies with her mother and later explained that this had inspired her interest in acting; she had not been influenced by her father. When she was eleven years old, the family moved back to Los Angeles and Jolie decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Strasberg_Theatre_Institute" title="Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute">Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute</a>, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the age of 14, she dropped out of her acting classes and dreamed of becoming a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_director" title="Funeral director">funeral director</a>. During this period, she wore black clothing, dyed her hair purple and went out <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing" title="Moshing">moshing</a> with her live-in boyfriend. Two years later, after the relationship had ended, she rented an apartment above a garage a few blocks from her mother's home. She returned to theatre studies and graduated from high school, though in recent times she has referred to this period with the observation, "I am still at heartâ€”and always will beâ€”just a punk kid with tattoos".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She later recalled her time as a student at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills_High_School" title="Beverly Hills High School">Beverly Hills High School</a> (later Moreno High School), and her feeling of isolation among the children of some of the area's more affluent families. Jolie's mother survived on a more modest income, and Jolie often wore second-hand clothes. She was teased by other students who also targeted her for her distinctive features, for being extremely thin, and for wearing glasses and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces" title="Dental braces">braces</a>. Her self-esteem was further diminished when her initial attempts at modeling proved unsuccessful. She started to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-injury" title="Self-injury">cut herself</a>; later commenting, "I collected knives and always had certain things around. For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie was estranged from her father for many years. The two tried to reconcile and he appeared with her in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider" title="Lara Croft: Tomb Raider">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</a></i> (2001). In July 2002, Jolie filed a request to legally change her name to "Angelina Jolie", dropping Voight as her surname; the name change was made official on September 12, 2002. In August of the same year, Voight claimed that his daughter had "serious mental problems" on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Hollywood" title="Access Hollywood">Access Hollywood</a></i>. Jolie later indicated that she no longer wished to pursue a relationship with her father, and said, "My father and I don't speak. I don't hold any anger toward him. I don't believe that somebody's family becomes their blood. Because my son's adopted, and families are earned." She stated that she did not want to publicize her reasons for her estrangement from her father, but because she had adopted her son, she did not think it was healthy for her to associate with Voight. In February 2010, Jolie publicly reunited with her father when he visited her while filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tourist_(2010_film)" title="The Tourist (2010 film)">The Tourist</a></i> in Venice.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie began working as a fashion model when she was 14 years old, modeling mainly in Los Angeles, New York and London. During that time she appeared in several music videos, namely those by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Kravitz" title="Lenny Kravitz">Lenny Kravitz</a> ("Stand by My Woman"; 1991), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonello_Venditti" title="Antonello Venditti">Antonello Venditti</a> ("Alta Marea"; 1991), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Healey" title="Jeff Healey">Jeff Healey</a> ("Lost in Your Eyes"; 1992), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lemonheads" title="The Lemonheads">The Lemonheads</a> ("It's About Time"; 1993), and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_Loaf" title="Meat Loaf">Meat Loaf</a> ("<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Dreams_Come_Through" title="Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through">Rock &amp; Roll Dreams Come Through</a>"; 1993). At the age of 16, Jolie returned to theatre and played her first role as a German <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominatrix" title="Dominatrix">dominatrix</a>. She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both "drama queens".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_School_of_Cinematic_Arts" title="USC School of Cinematic Arts">USC School of Cinematic Arts</a>, but her professional movie career began in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the low-budget film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_2" title="Cyborg 2">Cyborg 2</a></i>, as Casella "Cash" Reese, a near-human <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot" title="Robot">robot</a>, designed to seduce her way into a rival manufacturer's headquarters and then self-detonate. Following a supporting role in the independent film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_Evidence" title="Without Evidence">Without Evidence</a></i>, Jolie starred as Kate "Acid Burn" Libby in her first Hollywood picture, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)" title="Hackers (film)">Hackers</a></i> (1995), where she met her first husband <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Lee_Miller" title="Jonny Lee Miller">Jonny Lee Miller</a>. <i>The New York Times</i> wrote, "Kate (Angelina Jolie) stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top. Despite her sullen posturing, which is all this role requires, Ms. Jolie has the sweetly cherubic looks of her father, Jon Voight." The movie failed to make a profit at the box-office, but developed a cult following after its video release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She appeared as Gina Malacici in the 1996 comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Is_All_There_Is" title="Love Is All There Is">Love Is All There Is</a></i>, a modern-day loose adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i> set among two rival Italian family restaurant owners in the Bronx, New York. In the road movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Moon" title="Mojave Moon">Mojave Moon</a></i> (1996) she was a youngster, named Eleanor Rigby, who falls for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Aiello" title="Danny Aiello">Danny Aiello</a>'s character, while he takes a shine to her mother, played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Archer" title="Anne Archer">Anne Archer</a>. In 1996, Jolie also portrayed Margret "Legs" Sadovsky, one of five teenage girls who form an unlikely bond in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxfire_(1996_film)" title="Foxfire (1996 film)">Foxfire</a></i> after they beat up a teacher who has sexually harassed them. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> wrote about her performance, "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1997, Jolie starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Duchovny" title="David Duchovny">David Duchovny</a> in the thriller <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_God_(film)" title="Playing God (film)">Playing God</a></i>, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The movie was not received well by critics and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> noted that "Angelina Jolie finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a criminal's] girlfriend, and maybe she is." She then appeared in the television movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Women" title="True Women">True Women</a></i>, a historical romantic drama set in the American West, and based on the book by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janice_Woods_Windle" title="Janice Woods Windle">Janice Woods Windle</a>. That year she also appeared in the music video for "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anybody_Seen_My_Baby%3F" title="Anybody Seen My Baby?">Anybody Seen My Baby?</a>" by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stones" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie's career prospects began to improve after her performance as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelia_Wallace" title="Cornelia Wallace">Cornelia Wallace</a> in the 1997 biographical film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace_(film)" title="George Wallace (film)">George Wallace</a></i> for which she won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe Award</a> and was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Sinise" title="Gary Sinise">Gary Sinise</a> starred as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> Governor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace" title="George Wallace">George Wallace</a>. The film, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frankenheimer" title="John Frankenheimer">John Frankenheimer</a>, was praised by critics and, among other awards, received the Golden Globe for Best Miniseries/Motion Picture made for TV. She played the second wife of the former segregationist governor who was shot and paralyzed while running in 1972 for U.S. President.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1998, Jolie starred in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO" title="HBO">HBO</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gia" title="Gia">Gia</a></i>, portraying <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel" title="Supermodel">supermodel</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gia_Carangi" title="Gia Carangi">Gia Carangi</a>. The film depicted a world of sex, drugs and emotional drama, and chronicled the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her drug addiction, and her decline and death from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>. Vanessa Vance from Reel.com noted, "Angelina Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayalâ€”filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperationâ€”and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed." For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Award" title="Screen Actors Guild Award">Screen Actors Guild Award</a>. In accordance with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Strasberg" title="Lee Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting" title="Method acting">method acting</a>, Jolie reportedly preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting <i>Gia</i>, she told her then-husband <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Lee_Miller" title="Jonny Lee Miller">Jonny Lee Miller</a> that she would not be able to phone him: "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following <i>Gia</i>, Jolie moved to New York and stopped acting for a short time, because she felt that she had "nothing else to give". She enrolled at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University" title="New York University">New York University</a> to study filmmaking and attended writing classes. She described it as "just good for me to collect myself" on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_Actors_Studio" title="Inside the Actors Studio">Inside the Actors Studio</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie returned to film as Gloria McNeary in the 1998 gangster movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen_(1998_film)" title="Hell's Kitchen (1998 film)">Hell's Kitchen</a></i>, and later that year appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_by_Heart" title="Playing by Heart">Playing by Heart</a></i>, part of an ensemble cast that included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Connery" title="Sean Connery">Sean Connery</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Anderson" title="Gillian Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Phillippe" title="Ryan Phillippe">Ryan Phillippe</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart" title="Jon Stewart">Jon Stewart</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_in_60_Seconds_(2000_film)" title="Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)">Gone In 60 Seconds</a></i>, in which she played Sarah "Sway" Wayland, ex-girlfriend of car-thief <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage" title="Nicolas Cage">Nicolas Cage</a>. The role was small, and the <i>Washington Post</i> criticized that "all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth." She later explained that the film was a welcome relief after the heavy role of Lisa Rowe, and it became her highest grossing movie up until then, earning $237 million internationally.</p>

Although reflecting Jolie's real-life interest in promoting humanitarian relief, the film was critically and financially unsuccessful. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> wrote, "Jolie, as she did in her Oscar-winning role in <i>Girl, Interrupted</i>, can bring electricity and believability to roles that have a reality she can understand. She can also, witness the <i>Lara Croft</i> films, do acknowledged cartoons.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2005, Jolie took part at a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club_(USA)" title="National Press Club (USA)">National Press Club</a> luncheon, where she announced the founding of the <i>National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children</i>, an organization that provides free legal-aid to asylum-seeking children with no legal representation which Jolie personally funded with a donation of $500,000 for its first two years. Jolie also pushed for several bills to aid refugees and vulnerable children in the Third World. In addition to her political involvement, Jolie began using her public profile to promote humanitarian causes through the mass media. She filmed an MTV special, <i>The Diary Of Angelina Jolie &amp; Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa</i>, portraying her and noted economist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs" title="Jeffrey Sachs">Dr. Jeffrey Sachs</a> on a trip to a remote group of villages in Western Kenya. In 2006, Jolie announced the founding of the Jolie/Pitt Foundation which made initial donations to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Action_for_Children" title="Global Action for Children">Global Action for Children</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctors_Without_Borders" title="Doctors Without Borders">Doctors Without Borders</a> of $1 million each. Jolie also co-chairs the <i>Education Partnership for Children of Conflict</i>, founded at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Global_Initiative" title="Clinton Global Initiative">Clinton Global Initiative</a> in 2006, which helps fund education programs for children affected by conflict.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In 2003, she was the first recipient of the newly created <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_of_the_World_Award" title="Citizen of the World Award">Citizen of the World Award</a> by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Correspondents_Association" title="United Nations Correspondents Association">United Nations Correspondents Association</a>, and in 2005, she was awarded the <i>Global Humanitarian Award</i> by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNA-USA" title="UNA-USA">UNA-USA</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>'s King <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norodom_Sihamoni" title="Norodom Sihamoni">Norodom Sihamoni</a> awarded Jolie Cambodian citizenship for her conservation work in the country on August 12, 2005; she has pledged $5 million to set up a wildlife sanctuary in the north-western province of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battambang" title="Battambang">Battambang</a> and owns property there. In 2007, Jolie became a member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations" title="Council on Foreign Relations">Council on Foreign Relations</a>, and she received the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Award" title="Freedom Award">Freedom Award</a> by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rescue_Committee" title="International Rescue Committee">International Rescue Committee</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After she and Pitt donated $1 million to relief efforts in Haiti following a devastating 2010 earthquake, Jolie visited Haiti and the Dominican Republic to discuss the future of relief efforts. She also donated $100,000 to the United Nations for the 2010 August flood relief operations in Pakistan.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationships">Relationships</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On March 28, 1996, Jolie married British actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Lee_Miller" title="Jonny Lee Miller">Jonny Lee Miller</a>, her co-star in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)" title="Hackers (film)">Hackers</a></i> (1995). She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood. Jolie and Miller separated the following year and subsequently divorced on February 3, 1999. They remained on good terms and Jolie later explained, "It comes down to timing. I think he's the greatest husband a girl could ask for. I'll always love him, we were simply too young."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While shooting <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_Tin" title="Pushing Tin">Pushing Tin</a></i> (1999) she met American actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bob_Thornton" title="Billy Bob Thornton">Billy Bob Thornton</a>, and subsequently married him on May 5, 2000. As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of loveâ€”most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necksâ€”their relationship became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton divorced on May 27, 2003. Asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie has said in interviews that she is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality" title="Bisexuality">bisexual</a> and has long acknowledged that she had a sexual relationship with her <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxfire_(1996_film)" title="Foxfire (1996 film)">Foxfire</a></i> (1996) co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Shimizu" title="Jenny Shimizu">Jenny Shimizu</a>, "I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her." In 2003, asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, "Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In early 2005, Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of being the reason for the divorce of actors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt" title="Brad Pitt">Brad Pitt</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston" title="Jennifer Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a>. The allegation was that she and Pitt had started an affair during filming of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._%26_Mrs._Smith_(2005_film)" title="Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</a></i> (2005). She denied this on several occasions, but admitted that they "fell in love" on the set. In an interview in 2005, she explained, "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While Jolie and Pitt never publicly commented on the nature of their relationship, speculations continued throughout 2005. The first intimate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi" title="Paparazzi">paparazzi</a> photos emerged in April, one month after Aniston had filed for divorce; they showed Pitt, Jolie and her son Maddox at a beach in Kenya. During the summer Jolie and Pitt were seen together with increasing frequency and most of the entertainment media considered them a couple, dubbing them "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brangelina" title="Brangelina">Brangelina</a>". On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)" title="People (magazine)">People</a></i> that she was pregnant with Pitt's child and thereby confirmed their relationship for the first time in public.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In February 2010, Jolie and Pitt sued UK tabloid <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_of_the_World" title="News of the World">News of the World</a> for reporting they were splitting up.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="Children">Children</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child, seven-month-old Maddox Chivan. He was born on August 5, 2001 as Rath Vibol in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, and he initially lived in a local orphanage in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battambang" title="Battambang">Battambang</a>. Jolie decided to apply for adoption after she had visited Cambodia twice, while filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider" title="Lara Croft: Tomb Raider">Tomb Raider</a></i> and on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" title="UNHCR">UNHCR</a> field trip in 2001. After her divorce from her second husband, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bob_Thornton" title="Billy Bob Thornton">Billy Bob Thornton</a>, Jolie received sole custody of Maddox. Like Jolie's other children, Maddox has gained considerable celebrity and appears regularly in the tabloid media.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie adopted a six-month-old girl from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, Zahara Marley, on July 6, 2005. Zahara was born on January 8, 2005. She was originally named Yemsrach by her mother, and was later given the legal name Tena Adam at an orphanage. Jolie adopted her from Wide Horizons For Children orphanage in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa" title="Addis Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>. Shortly after they returned to the United States, Zahara was hospitalized for dehydration and malnutrition. In 2007, media outlets reported Zahara's biological mother, Mentewabe Dawit, was still alive and wanted her daughter back, but she later denied these reports, saying she thought Zahara was "very fortunate" to be adopted by Jolie.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt" title="Brad Pitt">Brad Pitt</a> was reportedly present when Jolie signed the adoption papers and collected her daughter; later Jolie indicated that she and Pitt made the decision to adopt Zahara together. On January 19, 2006 a judge in California approved Pitt's request to legally adopt Jolie's two children. Their surnames were formally changed to "Jolie-Pitt".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swakopmund" title="Swakopmund">Swakopmund</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" title="Namibia">Namibia</a>, by a scheduled <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section" title="Caesarean section">caesarean section</a>, on May 27, 2006. Pitt confirmed that their newly-born daughter would have a Namibian passport, and Jolie decided to sell the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images" title="Getty Images">Getty Images</a> herself, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs. <i>People</i> paid more than $4.1 million for the North American rights, while British magazine <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!" title="Hello!">Hello!</a></i> obtained the international rights for roughly $3.5 million. All profits were donated to an undisclosed charity by Jolie and Pitt. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Tussauds" title="Madame Tussauds">Madame Tussauds</a> in New York unveiled a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_figure" title="Wax figure">wax figure</a> of two-month-old Shiloh; it was the first infant re-created in wax by Madame Tussauds.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a three-year-old boy from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, Pax Thien, who was born on November 29, 2003 and abandoned at birth at a local hospital, where he was initially named Pham Quang Sang. Jolie adopted the boy from the Tam Binh orphanage in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Ho Chi Minh City</a>. She revealed that his first name, Pax, was suggested by her mother before her death.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following months of tabloid speculation, Jolie confirmed, at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Cannes_Film_Festival" title="2008 Cannes Film Festival">2008 Cannes Film Festival</a>, that she was expecting twins. She gave birth to a boy, Knox LÃ©on, and a girl, Vivienne Marcheline, by caesarean section at the Lenval hospital in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice" title="Nice">Nice</a>, France, on July 12, 2008. The rights for the first images of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to <i>People</i> and <i>Hello!</i> for $14 millionâ€”the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken. The money went to the Jolie/Pitt Foundation.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="In_the_media">In the media</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie appeared in the media from an early age due to her famous father <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Voight" title="Jon Voight">Jon Voight</a>. At seven she had a small part in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookin%27_to_Get_Out" title="Lookin' to Get Out">Lookin' to Get Out</a></i>, a movie co-written by and starring her father, and in 1986 and 1988 she attended the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> with him. However, when she started her acting career, Jolie decided not to use "Voight" as a stage name, because she wished to establish her own identity as an actress. Jolie was never shy about controversy and integrated her teenage "wild girl" image into her public persona in the first years of her career. During her acceptance speech at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Academy_Awards" title="72nd Academy Awards">2000 Academy Awards</a>, Jolie declared, "I'm so in love with my brother right now", which, combined with her affectionate behavior towards him that night, sparked speculation in the tabloid media of an incestuous relationship with her brother James Haven. She has denied those rumors vehemently, and Jolie and Haven later explained in interviews that after their parents' divorce they relied on one another and because of that they hold on to each other as a means of emotional support.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie does not employ a publicist or an agent. She quickly became a tabloid's favorite, since she presented herself as very outspoken in interviews, discussing her love life and her interest in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM" title="BDSM">BDSM</a> openly, and once claiming to be "most likely to sleep with a female fan". As one of her most distinctive physical features, Jolie's lips have attracted notable media attention and she was described in 2007 as "the current gold standard of beauty in the states and in the West in general right now", being the embodiment of "the exotic look, like Halle Berry and Penelope Cruz", among women seeking cosmetic surgery; it was also noted that her association with Brad Pitt had "accentuated" the frequency of requests for Jolie's looks. She also created headlines with her much publicized marriage to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bob_Thornton" title="Billy Bob Thornton">Billy Bob Thornton</a> and her subsequent change into an advocate for global humanitarian problems. As she took on the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR_Goodwill_Ambassador" title="UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador">UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador</a> she started to use her celebrity to highlight humanitarian causes worldwide. Jolie has been taking flying lessons since 2004 and she has a private pilot license (with an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_rating" title="Instrument rating">instrument rating</a>) and owns a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_SR22" title="Cirrus SR22">Cirrus SR22</a> airplane. The media speculated that Jolie is a Buddhist, but she said that she teaches <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> to her son Maddox because she considers it part of his culture. When asked in 2000 if there was a God, she said, "For the people who believe in it, I hope so. There doesn't need to be a God for me."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Starting in 2005, her relationship with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt" title="Brad Pitt">Brad Pitt</a> became one of the most reported celebrity stories worldwide. After Jolie confirmed her pregnancy in early 2006, the unprecedented media hype surrounding them "reached the point of insanity" as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters" title="Reuters">Reuters</a> described it in their story "The Brangelina fever". Trying to avoid the media attention, the couple went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" title="Namibia">Namibia</a> for the birth of Shiloh, "the most anticipated baby since Jesus Christ", as it had been described. Two years later, Jolie's second pregnancy again fueled a media frenzy. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice" title="Nice">Nice</a>, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Today, Jolie is one of the best known celebrities around the world. According to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_Score" title="Q Score">Q Score</a>, in 2000, subsequent to her Oscar win, 31% of respondents in the United States said Jolie was familiar to them, by 2006 she was familiar to 81% of Americans. In a 2006 global industry survey by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACNielsen" title="ACNielsen">ACNielsen</a> in 42 international markets Jolie, together with Brad Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.

She was described as the world's most beautiful woman in the 2006 "100 Most Beautiful" issue of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)" title="People (magazine)">People</a></i>, voted the greatest sex symbol of all time in the British <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> television show <i>The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols</i> in 2007, and named "Most beautiful woman in the world" by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i> in 2009. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> named Jolie the highest-paid actress of 2008, earning $15Â million per film.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jolie's numerous tattoos have been the subject of much media attention and have often been addressed by interviewers. Jolie stated that, while she is not opposed to film nudity, the large number of tattoos on her body have forced filmmakers to become more creative when planning nude or love scenes. Make-up has been used to cover up the tattoos in many of her productions. Jolie has thirteen known tattoos, among them the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a> quote "A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages", which she got together with her mother, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic language</a> phrase "Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø²ÙŠÙ…Ø©" (strength of will), the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> proverb "quod me nutrit me destruit" (what nourishes me destroys me), and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yantra_tattoo" title="Yantra tattoo">Yantra</a> prayer written in the ancient <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_script" title="Khmer script">Khmer script</a> for her son Maddox. She also has six sets of geographical coordinates on her upper left arm indicating the birthplaces of her children.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Susanna Kaysen (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winona_Ryder" title="Winona Ryder">Winona Ryder</a>), 18 years old in April 1967, voluntarily checks herself into Claymoore Hospital after an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose" title="Drug overdose">overdose</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin" title="Aspirin">aspirin</a> and her stay extends for over a year. She denies the accusation from many that she was attempting to commit suicide. Nurses and therapists are surprised when Susanna acknowledges that she does not actually want to go to college and would like to become a writer.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She befriends fellow patients Polly "Torch" Clark (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Moss" title="Elisabeth Moss">Elisabeth Moss</a>), Georgina Tuskin (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clea_DuVall" title="Clea DuVall">Clea DuVall</a>), Daisy Randone (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Murphy" title="Brittany Murphy">Brittany Murphy</a>), Janet Webber (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Bettis" title="Angela Bettis">Angela Bettis</a>), Cynthia Crowley (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jillian_Armenante" title="Jillian Armenante">Jillian Armenante</a>) and forms a small troupe of troubled women in her ward. Susanna is enchanted in particular by Lisa Rowe (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>) when she sees her cause a scene. When Lisa returns to the ward after running away she notices that her old best friend's place has been taken by Susanna. She demands to know what happened to her best friend, eventually realising that she had committed suicide. Lisa befriends Susanna and the two start causing trouble. Lisa encourages Susanna to stop taking her medications and/or trade them with others, and generally resist the influences of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy" title="Psychotherapy">therapy</a>.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Susanna's former boyfriend, Tobias "Toby" Jacobs (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Leto" title="Jared Leto">Jared Leto</a>), comes to visit her. Toby discovers that he is going to get drafted, and he tells her he wants them to run away to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> together. He tells her she isn't crazy and that the girls in the asylum aren't really her friends. But she refuses to go with him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is shown that Polly observes the couple almost wistfully as they speak outside, perhaps reflecting on her own unatractiveness and how it has impeded her from having such devotion from a man. That night, she awakes screaming. The nurses remove her and place her into solitary confinement with the intention of calming her down, but she continues sobbing. After all of the staff went to bed Susanna steals a guitar and she and Lisa sit outside Polly's room, singing "Downtown" by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petula_Clark" title="Petula Clark">Petula Clark</a>. Eventually a male orderly notices and Susanna seduces him in order for him not to report the incident, they fall asleep outside of Polly's room. In the morning, Valerie Owens, the RN (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg" title="Whoopi Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>) sees the two, she exclaims she is sick of her promiscuity and is referring her to the therapists.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The next morning, Susanna is called into the therapist's office, where she is analyzed once more. Susanna meets the head psychiatrist, Dr. Sonia Wick (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Redgrave" title="Vanessa Redgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</a>), and attempts to shut her out with a nasty attitude. Wick decides to have Susanna be her patient from now on. She is diagnosed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder" title="Borderline personality disorder">borderline personality disorder</a>. Lisa is also taken in to see the doctor but doesn't return, and Susanna falls into a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression" title="Clinical depression">depression</a>. The frustrated nurse, Valerie, has had enough and throws Susanna into a cold bath to wake her. Susanna attacks her verbally.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lisa returns, and she and Susanna break out of Claymoore. After hitching a ride, they spend the night at the house of the recently released Daisy, whom Lisa antagonizes in her usual fashion. She accuses Daisy of having <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest" title="Incest">incestual sex</a> with her father. It is revealed that Daisy continues cutting herself. Perhaps as a reaction to Lisa's words, Daisy hangs herself the next morning. Lisa runs away before anything could happen, trying to convince Susanna to come with her but she is mortified and stays. Susanna calls the police and returns to the hospital. Susanna also adopts Daisy's cat, Ruby. In the next few weeks, she begins to cooperate with her doctors and responds to her therapy, writing and painting. She is scheduled to be released.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At that point, Lisa is caught and returned by the police. Upon finding out about Susanna's pending release, Lisa targets Susanna for ridicule and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_abuse" title="Emotional abuse">emotional abuse</a>. On her last night, Susanna awakens to discover Lisa in the maze of corridors beneath the ward, reading Susanna's diary to Georgina and Polly, including all of the private thoughts and comments she has made about the other residents, including how she thought Lisa was already dead, which she eventually declares to her. The other girls turn on Susanna, with Lisa particularly vicious. In the ensuing dispute Lisa threatens to stab herself with a large <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle" title="Hypodermic needle">hypodermic needle</a>, but Susanna disarms her. Susanna then launches a pointed verbal attack upon Lisa. Her words having hit home, Lisa suffers a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_breakdown" title="Nervous breakdown">nervous breakdown</a>. Susanna and Lisa reconcile and are found by the staff.</p>
