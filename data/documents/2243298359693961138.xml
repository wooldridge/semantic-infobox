	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Handsome, irresponsible cad Johnnie Aysgarth (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a>) sweeps dowdy Lina McLaidlaw (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Fontaine" title="Joan Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>) off her feet and charms her into running away and marrying him, despite the strong disapproval of her wealthy father, General McLaidlaw (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Cedric_Hardwicke" title="Sir Cedric Hardwicke">Sir Cedric Hardwicke</a>). After their honeymoon, they set up housekeeping in extravagant fashion, though she soon learns that Johnnie is broke and was hoping to live off her father's generosity. She persuades him to get a job and he goes to work for his cousin, estate agent Captain Melbeck (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_G._Carroll" title="Leo G. Carroll">Leo G. Carroll</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gradually, Lina learns that Johnnie has continued to gamble on the horses, despite his promise to quit, and that he has sold family heirloom chairs given to them as a wedding present to help pay for things. She repeatedly catches him in lies and discovers that he has been caught embezzling and fired from his job, though Melbeck assures her he will not prosecute if the money is repaid. Johnnie's good-natured, if scatterbrained, friend Beaky (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Bruce" title="Nigel Bruce">Nigel Bruce</a>) tries to reassure her that her husband is a good sort, but without much success.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She begins to fear that her husband is plotting to kill her for her life insurance. He has been questioning her friend Isobel Sedbusk (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Auriol_Lee&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Auriol Lee (page does not exist)">Auriol Lee</a>), a writer of mystery novels, about untraceable poisons. When Johnnie brings Lina a glass of milk (by placing a light bulb in the milk, the filmmakers made the contents appear to glow as the glass is carried upstairs by Johnnie) before bed, but she is too afraid to drink it.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the subsequent row, it emerges that Johnnie was actually intending to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">kill himself</a>. Now however, he has decided that suicide is the coward's way out and is resolved to face his responsibilities and even go to jail for the embezzlement. He was actually in Liverpool at the time of Beaky's death. Her suspicions allayed, Lina tells him that they will face the future together.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In November 1939, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathanael_West" title="Nathanael West">Nathanael West</a> was hired as a screenwriter by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Radio_Pictures" title="RKO Radio Pictures">RKO Radio Pictures</a>, where he collaborated with Boris Ingster on a film adaptation of the novel. The two men wrote the screenplay in seven weeks, with West focusing on characterization and dialogue as Ingster worked on the narrative structure. When RKO assigned <i>Before the Fact</i> to Hitchcock, he already had his own, substantially different, screenplay, credited to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphaelson" title="Samson Raphaelson">Samson Raphaelson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Harrison_(screenwriter)" title="Joan Harrison (screenwriter)">Joan Harrison</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_Reville" title="Alma Reville">Alma Reville</a>. (Harrison was Hitchcock's personal assistant, and Reville was Hitchcock's wife.) West and Ingster's screenplay was abandoned and never produced. The text of this screenplay can be found in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_America" title="Library of America">Library of America</a>'s edition of West's collected works.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In places, the screenplay of <i>Suspicion</i> faithfully follows the plot of the novel. There are, however, a number of major differences between the novel and its film version. For example, all references to Johnnie Aysgarth's infidelity were removed. In the first days of Johnnie's "courtship", while the couple are driving through the countryside in Lina's car ("Have you ever been kissed in a car?"), she asks him how many women he has had. Johnnie gives a humorous rather than a really evasive answer: He says that once, when he could not go to sleep, he started counting them, just like sheep jumping over a hedge, and he fell asleep at number 73. However, this, even back in the early 1940s, was accepted, or at least tolerated, male behaviour, especially of a man who was considered a playboy. Much is left open for the cinema-goer to decide: Did he actually sleep with any, some, or all of them? Or did he only kiss them? The crime of adultery, on the other hand, is altogether left out in the plot of the film: Lina's best friend does not appear at all, and Ella, their maid, certainly does not have an illegitimate son by Johnnie: sex is not an issue.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Suspicion</i> is one of the famous examples where, in the process of rewriting the novel for the big screen, the plot was tampered with to an extent that Iles's original intention was completely reversed. As <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_L._DeAndrea" title="William L. DeAndrea">William L. De Andrea</a> states in his <i>Encyclopedia Mysteriosa</i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_in_literature" title="1994 in literature">1994</a>), <i>Suspicion</i> "was supposed to be the study of a murder as seen through the eyes of the eventual victim. However, because Cary Grant was to be the killer and Joan Fontaine the person killed, the studio â€” <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">RKO</a> â€” decreed a different ending, which Hitchcock supplied and then spent the rest of his life complaining about."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock was quoted as saying that he was forced to alter the ending of the movie. He wanted an ending similar to the climax of the novel, but the studio, more concerned with Cary Grant's "heroic" image, insisted that it be changed. Writer Donald Spoto, in his biography of Hitchcock <i>The Dark Side Of Genius</i>, disputes Hitchcock's claim to have been overruled on the film's ending. Spoto claims that the first RKO treatment and memos between Hitchcock and the studio show that Hitchcock emphatically desired to make a film about a woman's fantasy life.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A musical <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif" title="Leitmotif">leitmotif</a> is introduced in <i>Suspicion</i>. Whenever Lina is happy with Johnny â€” starting with a ball organised by General McLaidlaw â€” <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Strauss_II" title="Johann Strauss II">Johann StrauÃŸ</a>Â´s waltz "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Blut" title="Wiener Blut">Wiener Blut</a>" is played in its original, light-hearted version. At one point, when she is suspicious of her husband, a threatening, minor key version of the waltz is employed, metamorphosing into the full and happy version after the suspense has been lifted. At another, Johnny is whistling the waltz. At yet another, while Johnny is serving the drink of milk, a sad version of "Wiener Blut" is played again.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A visual threat is inserted when Lina suspects her husband of preparing to kill Beaky Thwaite: On the night before, at the Aysgarths' home, they play <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram" title="Anagram">anagrams</a>, and suddenly, by exchanging a letter, Lina has changed "mudder" into "murder". Seeing the word, Lina imagines the cliffs Johnny and Beaky told her they would be going to inspect the next morning, and faints.</p>
