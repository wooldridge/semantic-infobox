	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Godfather Part II</i> presents two parallel storylines. One involves <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia" title="American Mafia">Mafia</a> chief <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Corleone" title="Michael Corleone">Michael Corleone</a> from 1958 to 1959; the other is a series of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashbacks</a> following his father, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Corleone" title="Vito Corleone">Vito Corleone</a>, from his childhood in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> (1901) to his founding of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corleone_Family" title="Corleone Family">Corleone crime family</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1958, Michael Corleone, Godfather of the Corleone family, deals with various business and family problems at his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe" title="Lake Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> compound during an elaborate party celebrating his son's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Communion" title="First Communion">First Communion</a>. He meets with Nevada <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Geary" title="Pat Geary">Pat Geary</a>, who despises the Corleones. Geary, aware that Michael plans to gain control of another Vegas casino, demands a grossly exaggerated price for a new gaming license and a monthly payment of five percent of the gross profits from all of the Corleone family's Nevada gaming interests, all while insulting the Corleones and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_people" title="Italian people">Italians</a> in general. Michael coldly gives Geary his counter-offer: nothing.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Michael also deals with his sister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Corleone" title="Connie Corleone">Connie</a>, who, although recently divorced, is planning to marry a man of whom Michael disapproves. He meets with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Ola" title="Johnny Ola">Johnny Ola</a>, the right hand man of gangster <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyman_Roth" title="Hyman Roth">Hyman Roth</a>, who says that Roth will not object to Michael gaining <i>de facto</i> control of the Tropicana (the casinos are "owned" by frontmen, to conceal their true ownership by mobsters). Finally, Michael meets with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Pentangeli" title="Frank Pentangeli">Frank Pentangeli</a>, who took over Corleone <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caporegime" title="Caporegime">caporegime</a></i> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Clemenza" title="Peter Clemenza">Peter Clemenza</a>'s territory after Clemenza's death, and now has problems with the Rosato brothers, who are backed by Roth and are attempting to intrude on Pentangeli's territory. Michael refuses to allow Pentangeli to kill the Rosatos, in order to maintain a smooth business relationship with Roth. Pentangeli leaves after arguing with Michael.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later that night, an assassination attempt is made on Michael. He tells <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hagen" title="Tom Hagen">Tom Hagen</a> that the hit was made with the help of someone close. He then insists that he must leave and entrusts Hagen to protect his family. The Corleone guards then search the compound, and as Michael suspected, the gunmen are found dead.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Michael meets with Hyman Roth in his home near <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a> and tells him that he believes Frank Pentangeli was responsible for the assassination attempt. Traveling to his family's former home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_New_York" title="Long Beach, New York">Long Beach, New York</a> (which is now Pentangeli's home), Michael lets Pentangeli know that Roth was actually behind it and that Michael has a plan to deal with Roth, but needs Frankie to cooperate with the Rosato brothers in order to put Roth off guard. When Pentangeli goes to meet with the Rosatos, their men <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrote" title="Garrote">garrote</a> him, but the attempted murder is accidentally interrupted by a policeman.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, Michael meets Roth in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana" title="Havana">Havana</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> at the time when dictator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista" title="Fulgencio Batista">Fulgencio Batista</a> is soliciting American investment, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla" title="Guerrilla">guerrillas</a> are trying to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution" title="Cuban Revolution">bring down the government</a>. Hyman Roth is celebrating his birthday with business partners, when Michael reveals to Roth and others that he is hesitant to invest after he saw a rebel <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_bomb" title="Suicide bomb">suicide bomb</a> several of Batista's policemen with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade" title="Grenade">grenade</a>, convincing him that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> is capable of taking over. Roth privately requests Michael's investment once again.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fredo, carrying the promised money, arrives in Havana and meets Michael. Michael confides to his brother that it was Roth who tried to kill him, and that he plans to try again. Michael assures Fredo that he has already made his move, and that "Hyman Roth will never see the New Year." Instead of turning over the money, Michael asks Roth who gave the order to have Frank Pentangeli killed. Roth avoids the question, instead speaking angrily of the murder of his old friend and ally <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_Greene" title="Moe Greene">Moe Greene</a>, which Michael had orchestrated (as depicted at the end of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">first film</a>), saying, "I didn't ask who gave the order, because it had nothing to do with <i>business</i>!"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Michael returns to Las Vegas, where Hagen tells him that Roth escaped Cuba after suffering a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke" title="Stroke">stroke</a> and is recovering in Miami. Hagen also informs Michael that Kay had a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a> while he was away.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Michael returns to his compound in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe" title="Lake Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a>, declining to go into the same room as his wife and instead asking his mother whether his father's position as Don had alienated the family. In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">Senate</a> committee, of which Geary is a member, is conducting an investigation into the Corleone family. They question disaffected "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldato" title="Soldato">soldier</a>" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willi_Cicci" title="Willi Cicci">Willi Cicci</a>, but he cannot implicate Michael because he never received any direct orders from him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Michael appears before the committee, Geary makes a big show of supporting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian-Americans" title="Italian-Americans">Italian-Americans</a> and then excuses himself from the proceedings. Michael makes a statement challenging the committee to produce a witness to corroborate the charges against him. The hearing ends with the Chairman promising a witness who will do exactly that (Pentangeli). Tom Hagen and Michael observe that Roth's strategy to destroy Michael is well-planned. Fredo has been found and persuaded to return to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>, and in a private meeting he explains his betrayal to Michael: he is upset about being passed over to head the family. He helped Roth, thinking there would be something in it for him, but he swears he didn't know they wanted to kill Michael. He also tells Michael that the Senate Committee's chief counsel is on Roth's payroll. Michael then disowns Fredo and privately instructs <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Neri" title="Al Neri">Al Neri</a> that nothing is to happen to Fredo while their mother is still alive; the implication is that he will be murdered after she dies.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frank Pentangeli has made a deal with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a> to testify against Michael, believing he was the one who organized the attempt on his life. At the hearing in which Pentangeli is to testify, Michael arrives accompanied by Pentangeli's brother <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Pentangeli" title="Vincenzo Pentangeli">Vincenzo</a>, brought in from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>. Upon seeing his brother, Frank Pentangeli recants his earlier statements, saying that he runs his own family, and claims that the Corleone family is innocent of any wrongdoing, thereby derailing the government's case.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At a hotel room afterwards, Kay tries to leave Michael and take their children with her. Michael at first tries to mollify her, but, when she reveals to him that her recent "miscarriage" was actually an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a> to avoid bringing another son into Michael's criminal family, Michael explodes in anger and slaps her in the face.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmela_Corleone" title="Carmela Corleone">Carmela Corleone</a>, Michael's mother, dies and the whole Corleone family reunites at the funeral. Michael is still shunning Fredo, but relents when Connie implores him to forgive his brother. Michael and Fredo embrace - but as they do so Michael exchanges glances with Al Neri.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Michael, Hagen, Neri and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Lampone" title="Rocco Lampone">Rocco Lampone</a> discuss their final dealings with Roth, who has been unsuccessfully seeking <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum" title="Right of asylum">asylum</a> from various countries, and was even refused entry to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah" title="Aliyah">returning Jew</a>. Michael rejects Hagen's advice that the Corleone family's position is secure and that killing Roth and the Rosato brothers for revenge is an unnecessary risk. Later, Hagen pays a visit to Frank Pentangeli at the military base. Hagen talks about the honor of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, and Frank hints that if he were to commit <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a>, his family would be spared and taken care of. They agree on this and shake hands.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film reaches its <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_(narrative)" title="Climax (narrative)">climax</a> in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montage_sequence" title="Montage sequence">montage</a> of assassinations and death:</p>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>As he arrives in Miami to be taken into custody, Hyman Roth is shot in the stomach and killed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Lampone" title="Rocco Lampone">Rocco Lampone</a> disguised as a journalist. Lampone is immediately shot dead in turn, by FBI agents.</li>
	<li>Frank Pentangeli is found dead in his bathtub, having slit his wrists.</li>
	<li>Finally, Al Neri shoots Fredo in the head while they are fishing on Lake Tahoe, as Fredo is saying a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary" title="Hail Mary">Hail Mary</a> to help catch a fish. Michael watches from his den.</li>
      </ul>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The penultimate scene takes place as a flashback to December 1941 as the Corleone family is preparing a surprise birthday party for Vito. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Corleone" title="Sonny Corleone">Sonny</a> introduces <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rizzi_(The_Godfather)" title="Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)">Carlo Rizzi</a>, Connie's future husband, to his family. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal_Tessio" title="Sal Tessio">Sal Tessio</a> comes in with the cake, and they all talk about the recent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" title="Empire of Japan">Japanese</a>.

Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie <i>The Godfather Part II</i>. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen <i>The Godfather,</i> there was little reason to see an addition to the original story.
