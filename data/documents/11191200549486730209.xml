	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Diane Keaton</b> (born <b>Diane Hall</b>; January 5, 1946) is an American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States" title="Cinema of the United States">film</a> actress, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">director</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer" title="Film producer">producer</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter" title="Screenwriter">screenwriter</a>.

Her fourth, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall" title="Annie Hall">Annie Hall</a></i> (1977), won her the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton subsequently expanded her range to avoid becoming typecast as her <i>Annie Hall</i> persona. She became an accomplished dramatic performer, starting in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_for_Mr._Goodbar_(film)" title="Looking for Mr. Goodbar (film)">Looking for Mr. Goodbar</a></i> (1977) and received Academy Award nominations for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reds_(film)" title="Reds (film)">Reds</a></i> (1981) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin%27s_Room_(film)" title="Marvin's Room (film)">Marvin's Room</a></i> (1996).

Her father came from an Irish American Catholic background, and her mother came from a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> family. Keaton was raised a Methodist by her mother. Her first ambition to become an actor came after seeing her mother win the "Mrs. Los Angeles" pageant for homemakers. Keaton claimed that the theatricality of the event inspired her to become a stage actor. She has also credited <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn" title="Katharine Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a>, whom she admires for playing strong and independent women, as one of her inspirations.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton is a 1963 graduate of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana_High_School" title="Santa Ana High School">Santa Ana High School</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana,_California" title="Santa Ana, California">Santa Ana, California</a>. During her time there, she participated in singing and acting clubs at school, and starred as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_DuBois" title="Blanche DuBois">Blanche DuBois</a> in a school production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(play)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (play)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></i>. After graduation, she attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana_College" title="Santa Ana College">Santa Ana College</a>, and later <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Coast_College" title="Orange Coast College">Orange Coast College</a> as an acting student, but dropped out after a year to pursue an entertainment career in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. Upon joining the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actors%27_Equity_Association" title="Actors' Equity Association">Actors' Equity Association</a>, she adopted the surname of Keaton, her mother's maiden name, as there was already a registered Diane Hall. For a brief time, she also moonlighted nightclubs with a singing act. She would later revisit her nightclub act in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall" title="Annie Hall">Annie Hall</a></i> (1977) and a cameo in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Days" title="Radio Days">Radio Days</a></i> (1987).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton began studying acting at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_Playhouse" title="Neighborhood Playhouse">Neighborhood Playhouse</a> in New York City. She initially studied acting under the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meisner_technique" title="Meisner technique">Meisner technique</a>, an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast" title="Ensemble cast">ensemble</a> acting technique first evolved in the 1930s by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Meisner" title="Sanford Meisner">Sanford Meisner</a>, a New York stage actor/acting coach/director who had been a member of The Group Theater (1931â€“1940). She has described her acting technique as, "[being] only as good as the person you're acting with ... As opposed to going it on my own and forging my path to create a wonderful performance without the help of anyone. I always need the help of everyone!" According to her <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reds_(film)" title="Reds (film)">Reds</a></i> co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, "She approaches a script sort of like a play in that she has the entire script memorized before you start doing the movie, which I don't know any other actors doing that."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1968, Keaton became a member of the "Tribe" and understudy to Sheila in the original <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_(musical)" title="Hair (musical)">Hair</a></i>. She gained some notoriety for her refusal to disrobe at the end of Act I when the cast performs nude, even though nudity in the production was optional for actors (Those who performed nude received a $50 bonus). After acting in <i>Hair</i> for nine months, she auditioned for a part in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a>'s production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_It_Again,_Sam_(1972_film)" title="Play It Again, Sam (1972 film)">Play It Again, Sam</a></i>. After nearly being passed over for being too tall (at 5Â ft 8 in./1.73Â m she is two inches/5Â cm taller than Allen), she won the part.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After being nominated for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</a> for <i>Play It Again, Sam</i>, Keaton made her film debut in 1970's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovers_and_Other_Strangers" title="Lovers and Other Strangers">Lovers and Other Strangers</a></i>. She followed with guest roles on the television series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,_American_Style" title="Love, American Style">Love, American Style</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Gallery" title="Night Gallery">Night Gallery</a></i>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton's breakthrough role came two years later when she was cast as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Adams-Corleone" title="Kay Adams-Corleone">Kay Adams</a>, the girlfriend of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Corleone" title="Michael Corleone">Michael Corleone</a> (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>) in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>'s 1972 blockbuster <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i>. Coppola noted that he first noticed Keaton in <i>Lovers and Other Strangers</i>, and cast her because of her reputation for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(behavior)" title="Eccentricity (behavior)">eccentricity</a> that he wanted her to bring to the role (Keaton claims that at the time she was commonly referred to as "the kooky actress" of the film industry). Her performance in the film was loosely based on her real life experience of making the film, both of which she has described as being "the woman in a world of men". <i>The Godfather</i> was an unparalleled critical and financial success, becoming the highest grossing film of the year and winning the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Picture_Oscar" title="Best Picture Oscar">Best Picture Oscar</a> of 1972.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two years later she reprised her role as Kay Adams in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II" title="The Godfather Part II">The Godfather Part II</a></i>. She was initially reluctant, stating that, "At first, I was skeptical about playing Kay again in the <i>Godfather</i> sequel. But when I read the script, the character seemed much more substantial than in the first movie." In <i>Part II</i> her character changed dramatically, becoming more embittered about her husband's activities. Even though Keaton received widespread exposure from the films, her character's importance was minimal. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_magazine" title="Time magazine">Time</a></i> wrote that she was "invisible in <i>The Godfather</i> and pallid in <i>The Godfather, Part II</i>."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton's other notable films of the 1970s included many collaborations with Woody Allen. Although by the time they made films together, their romantic involvement had ended, she played many eccentric characters in several of his comic and dramatic films including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(film)" title="Sleeper (film)">Sleeper</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_and_Death" title="Love and Death">Love and Death</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interiors" title="Interiors">Interiors</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(film)" title="Manhattan (film)">Manhattan</a></i>, and the film version of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_It_Again,_Sam_(1972_film)" title="Play It Again, Sam (1972 film)">Play It Again, Sam</a></i>, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ross" title="Herbert Ross">Herbert Ross</a>. Allen has credited Keaton as his muse during his early film career.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1977, Keaton starred with Allen in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy" title="Romantic comedy">romantic comedy</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall" title="Annie Hall">Annie Hall</a></i>, one of her most famous roles. <i>Annie Hall</i> was written and directed by Allen and the film was believed to be autobiographical of his relationship with Keaton. Allen based the character of Annie Hall loosely on Keaton ("Annie" is a nickname of hers, and "Hall" is her original surname). Many of Keaton's mannerisms and her self-deprecating sense of humor were added into the role by Allen. (Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Meyers" title="Nancy Meyers">Nancy Meyers</a> has claimed "Diane's the most self-deprecating person alive".) Keaton has also said that Allen wrote the character as an "idealized version" of herself. The two starred as a frequently on-again, off-again couple living in New York City. Her acting was later summed up by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN" title="CNN">CNN</a> as "awkward, self-deprecating, speaking in endearing little whirlwinds of semi-logic", and by Allen as a "nervous breakdown in slow motion." The film was both a major financial and critical success, and won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a>. Keaton's performance also won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>. In 2006, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere_(magazine)" title="Premiere (magazine)">Premiere</a></i> magazine ranked Keaton in <i>Annie Hall</i> as 60th on their list of the "100 Greatest Performances of All Time":</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton's eccentric wardrobe in <i>Annie Hall</i>, which consisted mainly of vintage men's clothing, including neckties, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vest" title="Vest">vests</a>, baggy pants, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(hat)" title="Fedora (hat)">fedora</a> hats, made her an unlikely fashion icon of the late 1970s. Most of the clothing seen in the film came from Keaton herself, who was already known for her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomboy" title="Tomboy">tomboyish</a> clothing style years before <i>Annie Hall</i>, though Ruth Morley and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren" title="Ralph Lauren">Ralph Lauren</a> reportedly worked on the movie's costume. Soon after the film's release, men's clothing and pantsuits became popular attire for women. She is known to favor men's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vintage_clothing" title="Vintage clothing">vintage clothing</a>, and usually appears in public wearing gloves and conservative attire. (A 2005 profile in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> described her as "easy to find. Look for the only woman in sight dressed in a turtleneck. On a 90-degree afternoon in Pasadena.") Keaton would later reprise her <i>Annie Hall</i> appearance when she attended the 2003 Academy Awards presentation in a men's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tie" title="Black tie">tuxedo</a> and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_hat" title="Bowler hat">bowler hat</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her photo by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Kirkland" title="Douglas Kirkland">Douglas Kirkland</a> appeared on the cover of the September 26, 1977, issue <i>Time</i> magazine with the story dubbing her "the funniest woman now working in films." Later that year, she departed from her usual lighthearted comic roles when she won the highly coveted lead role in the drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_for_Mr._Goodbar_(film)" title="Looking for Mr. Goodbar (film)">Looking for Mr. Goodbar</a></i>, based on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_for_Mr._Goodbar" title="Looking for Mr. Goodbar">novel</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Rossner" title="Judith Rossner">Judith Rossner</a>. In the film she played a Catholic schoolteacher for deaf children who lives a double life, spending nights frequenting singles bars and engaging in promiscuous sex. Keaton became interested in the role after seeing it as a "psychological case history." The same issue of <i>Time</i> commended her role choice and criticized the restricted roles available for female actors in American films:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to acting, Keaton has stated that "[I] had a lifelong ambition to be a singer." She had a brief, unrealized career as a recording artist in the 1970s. Her first record was an original cast recording of <i>Hair</i>, in 1971. In 1977, she began recording tracks for a solo album, but the finished record never materialized.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton met with more success in the medium of still photography. Like her character in <i>Annie Hall</i>, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s she began exploring her avocation more seriously. "Rolling Stone had asked me to take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them", she recalled in 2003. "These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me." <i>Reservations</i>, her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After <i>Manhattan</i> in 1979, Keaton and Woody Allen ended their long working relationship, and the film would be their last major collaboration until 1993. In 1978, Keaton became romantically involved with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, and two years later he cast her to play opposite of him in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reds_(film)" title="Reds (film)">Reds</a></i>. In the film she played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Bryant" title="Louise Bryant">Louise Bryant</a>, a journalist and feminist, who flees from her husband to work with radical journalist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Silas_Reed" title="John Silas Reed">John Reed</a> (Beatty), and later enters Russia to locate him as he chronicles the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a>. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> wrote that Keaton was, "nothing less than splendid as Louise BryantÂ â€“ beautiful, selfish, funny and driven. It's the best work she has done to date." Keaton received her second Academy Award nomination for the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beatty cast Keaton after seeing her in <i>Annie Hall</i>, as he wanted to bring her natural nervousness and insecure attitude to the role. The production of <i>Reds</i> was delayed several times since its conception in 1977, and Keaton almost left the project when she believed it would never be produced. Filming finally began two years later. In a 2006 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i> story, Keaton described her role as "the everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was probably more ordinary ... I knew what it felt like to be extremely insecure." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_director" title="Assistant director">Assistant director</a> Simon Relph later stated that Louise Bryant was one of her most difficult roles, and that "[she] almost got broken."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1984 brought <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Drummer_Girl_(film)" title="The Little Drummer Girl (film)">The Little Drummer Girl</a></i>, Keaton's first excursion into the thriller and action genre. <i>The Little Drummer Girl</i> was both a financial and critical failure, with critics claiming that Keaton was miscast for the genre, such as one review from <i>The New Republic</i> claiming that "the title role, the pivotal role, is played by Diane Keaton, and around her the picture collapses in tatters. She is so feeble, so inappropriate." However, that same year she received positive reviews for her performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Soffel" title="Mrs. Soffel">Mrs. Soffel</a></i>, a film based on the true story of a repressed prison warden's wife who falls in love with a convicted murderer and arranges for his escape. Two years later she starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Lange" title="Jessica Lange">Jessica Lange</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sissy_Spacek" title="Sissy Spacek">Sissy Spacek</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_of_the_Heart_(film)" title="Crimes of the Heart (film)">Crimes of the Heart</a></i>, adapted from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Henley" title="Beth Henley">Beth Henley</a>'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play into a moderately successful screen comedy. She starred in her first commercial vehicle with 1987's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Boom_(film)" title="Baby Boom (film)">Baby Boom</a></i>, her first of four collaborations with writer-producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Meyers" title="Nancy Meyers">Nancy Meyers</a>. In <i>Baby Boom</i> Keaton starred as a Manhattan career woman who is suddenly forced to care for a toddler. That same year she made a cameo in Allen's film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Days" title="Radio Days">Radio Days</a></i> as a nightclub singer. 1988's <i>The Good Mother</i> was a misstep for Keaton. The film was a financial disappointment (according to Keaton, the film was "a Big Failure. Like, BIG failure"), and some critics panned her performance, such was one review from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i>: "her acting degenerates into hypeÂ â€“ as if she's trying to sell an idea she can't fully believe in."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1987, Keaton directed and edited her first feature film, a documentary named <i>Heaven</i> about the possibility of an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife" title="Afterlife">afterlife</a>. <i>Heaven</i> met with mixed critical reaction, with <i>The New York Times</i> likening it to "a conceit imposed on its subjects." Over the next four years, Keaton went on to direct music videos for artists such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belinda_Carlisle" title="Belinda Carlisle">Belinda Carlisle</a>, two television films starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Arquette" title="Patricia Arquette">Patricia Arquette</a>, and episodes of the series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Beach" title="China Beach">China Beach</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks" title="Twin Peaks">Twin Peaks</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the 1990s, Keaton had established herself as one of the most popular and versatile actors in Hollywood. Now middle-aged, she shifted to more mature roles, frequently playing matriarchs of middle-class families. Of her role choices and avoidance of becoming <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting_(acting)" title="Typecasting (acting)">typecast</a>, she said: "Most often a particular role does you some good and Bang! You have loads of offers, all of them for similar roles ... I have tried to break away from the usual roles and have tried my hand at several things."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She began the decade with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lemon_Sisters" title="The Lemon Sisters">The Lemon Sisters</a></i>, a poorly received comedy/drama that she starred in and produced, which was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelved" title="Shelved">shelved</a> for a year after its completion. In 1991, Keaton starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Martin" title="Steve Martin">Steve Martin</a> in the family <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy" title="Comedy">comedy</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_the_Bride_(1991_film)" title="Father of the Bride (1991 film)">Father of the Bride</a></i>. She was almost not cast in the film, as the commercial failure of <i>The Good Mother</i> had strained her relationship with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures" title="Walt Disney Pictures">Walt Disney Pictures</a>, the studio of both films. <i>Father of the Bride</i> was Keaton's first major hit after four years of commercial disappointments.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton reprised her role four years later in the sequel, as a woman who becomes pregnant in middle age at the same time as her daughter. A review of the film for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Examiner" title="San Francisco Examiner">San Francisco Examiner</a></i> was one of many in which Keaton once again received comparison to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn" title="Katharine Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a>: "No longer relying on that stuttering uncertainty that seeped into all her characterizations of the 1970s, she has somehow become Katharine Hepburn with a deep maternal instinct, that is, she is a fine and intelligent actress who doesn't need to be tough and edgy in order to prove her feminism."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton reprised her role of Kay Adams in 1990's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_III" title="The Godfather Part III">The Godfather Part III</a></i>. Set 20 years after the end of <i>The Godfather, Part II</i>, Keaton's part had evolved into the estranged ex-wife of Michael Corleone. Criticism of the film and Keaton again centered on her character's unimportance in the film. <i>The Washington Post</i> wrote: "Even though she is authoritative in the role, Keaton suffers tremendously from having no real function except to nag Michael for his past sins." In 1993, Keaton starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Murder_Mystery" title="Manhattan Murder Mystery">Manhattan Murder Mystery</a></i>, her first film with Woody Allen since 1979. Her part was originally intended for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Farrow" title="Mia Farrow">Mia Farrow</a>, but Farrow dropped out of the project after her split with Allen.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1995, Keaton directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstrung_Heroes" title="Unstrung Heroes">Unstrung Heroes</a></i>, her first theatrically released narrative film. The movie, adapted from Franz Lidz's memoir, starred Nathan Watt as a boy in 1960s whose mother (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andie_MacDowell" title="Andie MacDowell">Andie MacDowell</a>) becomes ill with cancer. As her sickness advances and his inventor father (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Turturro" title="John Turturro">John Turturro</a>) grows increasingly distant, the boy is sent to live with his two eccentric uncles (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maury_Chaykin" title="Maury Chaykin">Maury Chaykin</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Richards" title="Michael Richards">Michael Richards</a>). In a geographic switch, Keaton shifted the story's setting from the New York of Lidz's book to the Southern California of her own childhood. Though it played in a relatively limited release and made little impression at the box office, the film and its direction were well-received critically.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton's most successful film of the decade was the 1996 comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Wives_Club" title="The First Wives Club">The First Wives Club</a></i>. She starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldie_Hawn" title="Goldie Hawn">Goldie Hawn</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Midler" title="Bette Midler">Bette Midler</a> as a trio of "first wives": middle-aged women who had been divorced by their husbands in favor of younger women. Keaton claimed that making the film "saved [her] life." The film was a major success grossing US$105 million at the North American box office, and it developed a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film" title="Cult film">cult</a> following among middle-aged women. Reviews of the film were generally positive for Keaton and her co-stars, and she was even referred to by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="The San Francisco Chronicle">The San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> as "probably [one of the] the best comic film actresses alive."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also in 1996, Keaton starred as Bessie, a woman with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia" title="Leukemia">leukemia</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin%27s_Room_(film)" title="Marvin's Room (film)">Marvin's Room</a></i>, an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep" title="Meryl Streep">Meryl Streep</a> played her estranged sister Lee, although had initially been considered for the role of Bessie. The film also starred a young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Di_Caprio" title="Leonardo Di Caprio">Leonardo Di Caprio</a> as Streep's rebellious son. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> stated that "Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems." Keaton earned a third Academy Award nomination for the film. Although critically acclaimed, the film was not released on a wide scale, possibly costing Keaton the Oscar. Keaton said that the biggest challenge of the role was understanding the mentality of a person with terminal illness.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton narrated the one-hour public radio documentary, "If I Get Out Alive," the first to focus on the conditions and brutality faced by young people in the adult correctional system. The program, produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media, aired on public radio stations across the country, and was honored with a First Place National Headliner Award and a Casey Medal for Meritorious Journalism.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton's first film of 2000 was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Up" title="Hanging Up">Hanging Up</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg_Ryan" title="Meg Ryan">Meg Ryan</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Kudrow" title="Lisa Kudrow">Lisa Kudrow</a>. Keaton also directed the film, despite claiming in a 1996 interview that she would never direct herself in a film, saying "[as a director] you automatically have different goals. I can't think about directing when I'm acting." The film was a drama about three sisters coping with the senility and eventual death of their elderly father. <i>Hanging Up</i> rated poorly with critics, and grossed a modest US$36 million at the North American box office.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2001, Keaton co-starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> once again in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_%26_Country_(film)" title="Town &amp; Country (film)">Town &amp; Country</a></i>, a critical and financial fiasco. Budgeted at an estimated US$90 million, the film opened to little notice and grossed only $7 million in its North American theatrical run. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Travers" title="Peter Travers">Peter Travers</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> claimed that <i>Town &amp; Country</i> was, "less deserving of a review than it is an obituary ... The corpse took with it the reputations of its starry cast, including Warren Beatty [and] Diane Keaton".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2001 and 2002, Keaton starred in four low-budget television films. She played a fanatical nun in the religious drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Mary_Explains_It_All" title="Sister Mary Explains It All">Sister Mary Explains It All</a></i>, an impoverished mother in the drama <i>On Thin Ice</i>, and a bookkeeper in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia" title="Mafia">mob</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy" title="Comedy">comedy</a> <i>Plan B</i>. In <i>Crossed Over</i> she played Beverly Lowry, a woman who forms an unusual friendship with the only woman executed while on death row in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karla_Faye_Tucker" title="Karla Faye Tucker">Karla Faye Tucker</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton's first major hit since 1996 came in 2003's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something%27s_Gotta_Give_(film)" title="Something's Gotta Give (film)">Something's Gotta Give</a></i>, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Meyers" title="Nancy Meyers">Nancy Meyers</a> and co-starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 63 and 57 respectively, were seen as bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy. Twentieth Century Fox, the film's original studio, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were too old to be bankable. Keaton commented about the situation in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies%27_Home_Journal" title="Ladies' Home Journal">Ladies' Home Journal</a></i>: "Let's face it, people my age and Jack's age are much deeper, much more soulful, because they've seen a lot of life. They have a great deal of passion and hope- why shouldn't they fall in love? Why shouldn't movies show that?" Keaton played a middle-aged playwright who falls in love with her daughter's much older boyfriend. The film was a major success at the box office, grossing US$125 million in North America. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> wrote that "[Nicholson and Keaton] bring so much experience, knowledge and humor to their characters that the film works in ways the screenplay might not have even hoped for." The following year, Keaton received her fourth Academy Award nomination for her role in the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most recently, Keaton starred in the moderately successful 2005 comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_Stone" title="The Family Stone">The Family Stone</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jessica_Parker" title="Sarah Jessica Parker">Sarah Jessica Parker</a>.

She has co-starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Collins" title="Stephen Collins">Stephen Collins</a> in both <i>The First Wives Club</i> (1996) and <i>Because I Said So</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton has served as a producer on films and television series. She produced the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Network" title="Fox Network">FOX</a> series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena_(TV_series)" title="Pasadena (TV series)">Pasadena</a></i>, which was canceled after airing only four episodes in 2001 but later completed its run on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television" title="Cable television">cable</a> in 2005. In 2003, she produced the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Van_Sant" title="Gus Van Sant">Gus Van Sant</a> drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_(film)" title="Elephant (film)">Elephant</a></i>, about a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting" title="School shooting">school shooting</a>. On why she produced the film, she said "It really makes me think about my responsibilities as an adult to try and understand what's going on with young people."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Outside of the film industry, Keaton has continued to pursue her interest in photography. As a collector, she told <i>Vanity Fair</i> in 1987: "I have amassed a huge library of imagesÂ â€“ kissing scenes from movies, pictures I like. Visual things are really key for me." She has published several more collections of her own photographs, and has also served as an editor for collections of vintage photography. Works she has edited in the last decade include a book of photographs by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzo" title="Paparazzo">paparazzo</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Galella" title="Ron Galella">Ron Galella</a>, an anthology of reproductions of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown" title="Clown">clown</a> paintings, and a collection of photos of California's Spanish Colonial-style houses.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton has also established herself as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate" title="Real estate">real estate</a> developer. She has resold several mansions in Southern California after renovating and redesigning them. One of her clients is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>, who purchased a US$6.5 million Beverly Hills mansion from Keaton in 2003. She received the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Society_of_Lincoln_Center" title="Film Society of Lincoln Center">Film Society of Lincoln Center</a>'s Gala Tribute in 2007.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton will star in the upcoming HBO pilot, <i>Tilda</i>, playing the title role. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Page" title="Ellen Page">Ellen Page</a> will co-star as her assistant.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton's most famous romance was with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a>. Keaton and Allen first met during her audition for the Broadway production of <i>Play It Again, Sam</i>, but they did not know each other personally until having dinner after a late night rehearsal. Allen claims that Keaton's sense of humor attracted him to her. They briefly lived together during the Broadway run of <i>Play It Again, Sam</i>, but their relationship became less formal by the time the film version was produced in 1972. They went on to produce eight films together between 1971 and 1993.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1979, she began dating her <i>Reds</i> co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>. Keaton's involvement with Beatty also made her a regular subject of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid" title="Tabloid">tabloid</a> magazines and media at the time, a role to which she was unaccustomed. (As a result of her avoidance of the spotlight, <i>Vanity Fair</i> described her in 1985 as "the most reclusive star since <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo" title="Greta Garbo">Garbo</a>".) Beatty and Keaton separated shortly after completing <i>Reds</i>. Their separation was believed to have been caused by the strain of making the film, a troubled production with numerous financial and scheduling problems. Keaton still maintains contact with both Allen and Beatty, and describes Allen as one of her closest friends.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton also had a relationship with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>, her co-star in <i>The Godfather Trilogy</i>. The on-again, off-again relationship ended following the filming of <i>The Godfather Part III</i>. Referring to the relationship, Keaton has said "Al was simply the most entertaining man... To me, that's, that is the most beautiful face. I think Warren was gorgeous, very pretty, but Al's face is like whoa. Killer, killer face."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In July 2001, Keaton publicly announced that she had given up pursuing romance, and stated, "I don't think that because I'm not married it's made my life any less. That old maid myth is garbage." Keaton has two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption" title="Adoption">adopted</a> children, a daughter, Dexter (adopted 1996), and a son, Duke (adopted 2001). Keaton decided to become a mother at the age of 50 after the death of her father, when she began to realize her own mortality. She later said of having children, "Motherhood has completely changed me. It's just about the most completely humbling experience that I've ever had."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton stated that she produced her 1987 documentary <i>Heaven</i> because, "I was always pretty religious as a kid ... I was primarily interested in religion because I wanted to go to heaven" but also stated that she considered herself an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Raised a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist" title="Methodist">Methodist</a>, Keaton stated in an October 2002 television interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_Oxygen" title="Oh! Oxygen">Oxygen</a> that although she currently believes in God, she considered herself an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist" title="Atheist">atheist</a> for a period of her life. Woody Allen once said of her, "(She) believes in God, but she also believes that the radio works because there are tiny people inside it".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Keaton is an opponent of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery" title="Plastic surgery">plastic surgery</a>. She told <i>More</i> magazine in 2004, "I'm stuck in this idea that I need to be authentic ... My face needs to look the way I feel." Keaton is also active in campaigns with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Conservancy" title="Los Angeles Conservancy">Los Angeles Conservancy</a> to save and restore historic buildings, particularly in the Los Angeles area.

One of Allen's most popular films, it won numerous awards at the time of its release, including four <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> and one for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Picture" title="Best Picture">Best Picture</a>, and in 2002 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> described it as "just about everyone's favorite Woody Allen movie". <i>Annie Hall</i> was also the last comedy film to win the Academy Award for "Best Picture" until 1998's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_Love" title="Shakespeare in Love">Shakespeare in Love</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen had previously been known as a maker of zany comedies; the director has described <i>Annie Hall</i> as "a major turning point", as it brought a new level of seriousness to his work.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alvy Singer (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a>) is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotic" title="Neurotic">neurotic</a> comedian, attempting to maintain a relationship with the seemingly <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ditzy" title="wiktionary:ditzy">ditzy</a> but exuberant Annie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a>). The film chronicles their relationship over several years, intercut with various imaginary trips into each other's history (Annie is able to "see" Alvy's family when he was only a child, and likewise Alvy observes Annie's past relationships). In the first flashback showing Alvy as a child, we learn he was raised in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>; his father's occupation was operating a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_cars" title="Bumper cars">bumper cars</a> concession and the family home was located below the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(Coney_Island)" title="Thunderbolt (Coney Island)">Thunderbolt</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster" title="Roller coaster">roller coaster</a> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island" title="Coney Island">Coney Island</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After many arguments and reconciliations, the two realize they are fundamentally different and split up. Annie moves in with Tony Lacey (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Simon" title="Paul Simon">Paul Simon</a>). Annie likes California, but Alvy hates it. Alvy soon realizes he still loves her and tries to persuade her to return with him to New York. He fails and, resignedly, returns home to write a play about their relationship, recycling the conversation they had exchanged in California, but ending with him winning Annie back.</p>

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen's working title for the film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia" title="Anhedonia">Anhedonia</a></i> (a psychoanalytic term for the inability to experience pleasure from normally pleasurable life events), but this was considered unmarketable, as were Brickman's suggested alternatives, <i>It Had to Be Jew</i>, <i>Rollercoaster Named Desire</i> and <i>Me and My Goy.</i> Ultimately <i>Annie Hall</i> was decided on as the release title. Because of biographical similarities between the character Alvy and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a> (including Allen's previous relationship with co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a>, whose real name is Diane Hall, and who portrays the character Annie Hall), <i>Annie Hall</i> has been widely assumed to be semi-autobiographical. Allen has denied this.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was originally intended to be a drama centered on a murder mystery with a comic and romantic subplot. However, during script revisions, Allen decided to drop the murder plot. According to Allen, the murder occurred after a scene that remains in the film, the sequence in which Annie and Alvy miss the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_to_Face_(1976_film)" title="Face to Face (1976 film)">Face to Face</a></i>. Allen and co-writer Marshall Brickman would make a murder mystery film many years later, with 1993's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Murder_Mystery" title="Manhattan Murder Mystery">Manhattan Murder Mystery</a></i>, also starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, the production of the film was semi-improvisational. For example, in the original script, Alvy didn't grow up under a roller coaster, but while Allen was driving around Brooklyn with his crew, looking for locations, "I saw this roller-coaster, and I saw the house under it. And I thought, we have to use this." The 'house' in question is in fact the Kensington Hotel, which really was located underneath the Thunderbolt roller coaster. Another example is the scene in which Alvy sneezes into cocaine, which was purely accidental, but Allen decided to keep it in the movie; when they tested it with audiences they laughed so much that Allen had to add more footage after the scene so they wouldn't laugh through important conversations afterwards.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Style_and_technique">Style and technique</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen has said that <i>Annie Hall</i> was "a major turning point" both thematically and technically. "I had the courage to abandon... just clowning around and the safety of complete broad comedy. I said to myself, 'I think I will try and make some deeper film and not be as funny in the same way. And maybe there will be other values that will emerge, that will be interesting or nourishing for the audience.' And it worked out very very well."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen has also stated that working with cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Willis" title="Gordon Willis">Gordon Willis</a> for the first time on <i>Annie Hall</i> helped improve his technical skills, calling Willis "a very important teacher" and a "technical wizard." <i>Annie Hall</i> was the first of Allen's films to utilize long takes, where sometimes one shot will continue, unabridged, for an entire scene. Allen has commented, "It just seems more fun and quicker and less boring for me to do long scenes." Film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> cites a study that calculated the average shot length of <i>Annie Hall</i> to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4â€“7 seconds. Ebert adds that the long takes add to the dramatic power of the film, saying, "Few viewers probably notice how much of <i>Annie Hall</i> consists of people talking, simply talking. They walk and talk, sit and talk, go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie's free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by Diane Keaton is as close to perfect as such a speech can likely be... all done in one take of brilliant brinkmanship." As detailed in the book <i>When the Shooting Stops... The Cutting Begins,</i> written by the film's editor, Ralph Rosenblum, with Robert Karen, the trick to editing <i>Annie Hall</i> was paring the film down to its essential. The first rough cut was two hours and twenty minutes long; various subplots, background scenes and flashbacks-within-flashbacks were deleted to focus on the love story.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the film isn't essentially experimental, Allen at several points undermines the illusion of reality. In one famous scene, Allen's character, standing in line to see a movie with Annie and listening to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan" title="Marshall McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a>'s work, leaves the line to speak to the camera directly. The man then steps out of the queue and speaks to the camera in his own defense, and Allen resolves the dispute by pulling McLuhan himself from behind a free-standing movie posterboard to tell the man that his interpretation is wrong. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in an earlier stage of their relationship making conversation and getting to know each other, humorous subtitles convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner thoughts. An animated scene depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film)" title="Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)">Snow White</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other techniques that undermine the film's realism are taken from Allen's artistic influences. In one such scene (used by Allen's idol Ingmar Bergman in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Strawberries_(film)" title="Wild Strawberries (film)">Wild Strawberries</a></i>) the main characters visit Alvyâ€™s childhood. Allen would use this again in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_and_Misdemeanors" title="Crimes and Misdemeanors">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a>.</i> Similarly, the school scenes in the beginning of the film were influenced by another idol of Allenâ€™s, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini" title="Federico Fellini">Federico Fellini</a>, to whose <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarcord" title="Amarcord">Amarcord</a></i> <i>Annie Hall</i> owes a great debt. The Jewish humor--particularly the character of the oversexed Jewish man--also draws from Philip Roth's novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portnoy%27s_Complaint" title="Portnoy's Complaint">Portnoy's Complaint</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While Allen uses most of these techniques only one time, he "breaks the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>" several times when Alvy directly addresses the audience. In one, he stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in one of the film's last scenes, he makes modest excuses for the fact that a scene from his "first play" (which the audience has just seen) is his wish-fulfillment version of his breakup with Annie. Allen chose to have Alvy break the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>, he explained, "because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film has no soundtrack and very little background music is heardâ€”an homage to Allenâ€™s idol, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>. The few instances of music in the film include a boy's choir Christmas melody played while the characters drive through Los Angeles, the Molto allegro from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._41_(Mozart)" title="Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)">Jupiter Symphony</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart" title="Mozart">Mozart</a> heard as Annie and Alvy drive through the countryside, Annie's two performances at the jazz club; Annie's song is also reprised in the film's final scene; and there is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzak" title="Muzak">muzak</a> version of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Brown" title="Savoy Brown">Savoy Brown</a> song "A Hard Way to Go" playing in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Simon" title="Paul Simon">Paul Simon</a> character's mansion during a party.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen says he gets approached "all the time" about making a sequel to <i>Annie Hall</i>, but has repeatedly declined. He admitted in a 1995 interview that for a time he considered it, saying,</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film also had an influence on the fashion world during the late-70s, with many women adopting Keaton's distinctive look, layering oversized, mannish blazers over vests, billowy trousers or long skirts, and boots. Keaton's wardrobe also included a tie by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren" title="Ralph Lauren">Ralph Lauren</a>. The look was often referred to as the "<i>Annie Hall</i> look". An example of the influence this look has had on the culture can be found in a 1970s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doonesbury" title="Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_strip" title="Comic strip">comic strip</a>, where <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Trudeau" title="Garry Trudeau">Garry Trudeau</a> depicts radio interviewer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Slackmeyer" title="Mark Slackmeyer">Mark Slackmeyer</a> asking the fictional Iranian revolutionary leader Dr. Ali Mahdavi if the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayatollah_Khomeini" title="Ayatollah Khomeini">Ayatollah Khomeini</a> would approve of "The Annie Hall look" for Iranian women. Mahdavi's response: "If worn with a veil, fine."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen recalled that Keaton's natural fashion sense (the outfits that Keaton wore in the film were her own clothes) almost did not end up in the film. "She came in," he recalled in 1995, "and the costume lady on <i>Annie Hall</i> said, 'Tell her not to wear that. She can't wear that. It's so crazy.' And I said, 'Leave her. She's a genius. Let's just leave her alone, let her wear what she wants.'</p>
