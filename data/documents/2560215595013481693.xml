However, Jack is more interested in "sowing his wild oats" and having one last <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual_sex" title="Casual sex">sexual fling</a>. Along the way, Miles stops to see his mother for her birthday, and also to steal some cash that she keeps hidden. During dinner it becomes clear that Miles still has strong feelings for his ex-wife, Victoria.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soon after their arrival in wine country, they encounter Maya (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Madsen" title="Virginia Madsen">Virginia Madsen</a>), a waitress at Miles' favorite restaurant, and her friend Stephanie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Oh" title="Sandra Oh">Sandra Oh</a>), a winery employee. Jack quickly arranges a double date. Neither man tells the women about Jack's imminent marriage. Jack embarks on a whirlwind affair with Stephanie while Miles hesitantly tries to connect with Maya. After some fumbling and awkward moments, Miles and Maya sleep together, and he gives her a copy of his unpublished <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript" title="Manuscript">manuscript</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following day, Miles accidentally lets slip to Maya the fact that Jack is soon to be married. She tells Stephanie, who attacks Jack, breaking his nose. Miles also receives the crushing news that his novel has been rejected yet again, and his agent advises him that it is probably futile to keep resubmitting it. He causes a scene in a winery, drinking the contents of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spittoon" title="Spittoon">spittoon</a> in an attempt to drown his sorrows.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Miles hopes that the altercation with Stephanie has quieted Jack's hormonally charged mindset, but Jack meets Cammi, an overweight <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitress" title="Waitress">waitress</a> who recognizes him from his acting work, and he goes home with her. Miles is awakened in the middle of the night by Jack, who has returned to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motel" title="Motel">motel</a> panicked and naked. He breathlessly tells Miles that Cammi's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husband" title="Husband">husband</a> caught him <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_flagrante_delicto" title="In flagrante delicto">in flagrante delicto</a> and he had to run, leaving behind his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothes" title="Clothes">clothes</a> and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallet" title="Wallet">wallet</a> containing irreplaceable, custom-made <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_band" title="Wedding band">wedding bands</a>. If he returns home without the rings, he says, his fiancee will dump him, and that will destroy him. He tearfully begs Miles to retrieve the bands. Miles reluctantly agrees to help, sneaking into Cammi's house while she and her husband are having <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex" title="Sex">sex</a>. He retrieves the wallet, but is furiously pursued out of the house by Cammi's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked" title="Naked">naked</a> husband, narrowly escaping. As a cover <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story" title="Story">story</a> to explain his broken nose, Jack fakes an accident, runs Miles' car into a tree (and eventually into a ditch). Jack's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiancee" title="Fiancee">fiancee</a> and her wealthy family believe the tale and offer him support and sympathy.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the wedding, Miles encounters his ex-wife, Victoria, who has remained friendly with Jack. She introduces Miles to her new husband and tells him that she is pregnant. Miles, finally forced to face the fact that Victoria will never return to him, skips the reception to go home and get his most prized bottle, a 1961 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Cheval_Blanc" title="ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc">ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc</a>. He had purchased the wine so that he and Victoria could drink it together on the 10th anniversary of their wedding; instead, he drinks it alone, unceremoniously, from a foam cup at a fast-food restaurant.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A surprise hit, <i>Sideways</i> became popular in Hollywood, the US and internationally. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ynez_Valley" title="Santa Ynez Valley">Santa Ynez Valley</a>, where much of the film is set, attracted increased tourism. The film was nominated for dozens of awards, winning many, and was dubbed "the best reviewed movie of 2004."

A similar trend occurred in British wine outlets. Sales of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlot" title="Merlot">Merlot</a> dropped after the film's release possibly due to Miles' disparaging remarks about the varietal in the film. However, sales of Merlot in the United States remain more than double those of Pinot Noir, the country's second most popular wine.</p>
