He was raised <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a> and still practices his faith. His father, Philip Andre Rourke, Sr., an amateur body builder, left the family when Mickey was six years old. After his parents divorced, his mother, Ann, married Eugene Addis, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach" title="Miami Beach">Miami Beach</a> police officer with five sons, and moved Rourke, his younger brother, and their sister to southern <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>. There, he graduated from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach_Senior_High_School" title="Miami Beach Senior High School">Miami Beach Senior High School</a> in 1971.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his teenage years, Rourke focused his attention mainly on sports. He took up self-defense training at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_%26_Girls_Clubs_of_America" title="Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America">Boys Club</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a>. It was there that he learned boxing skills and decided on an amateur career. At age 12, Rourke won his first boxing match as a 118-pound <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight" title="Bantamweight">bantamweight</a> (53.5Â kg), fighting some of his early matches under the name Andre Rourke. He continued his boxing training at the famed 5th Street Gym, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida" title="Miami Beach, Florida">Miami Beach, Florida</a>, where <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali" title="Muhammad Ali">Muhammad Ali</a> began his career. In 1969, Rourke, then weighing 140Â lbs. (63.5Â kg), sparred with former World Welterweight Champion <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_(boxer)" title="Luis RodrÃ­guez (boxer)">Luis RodrÃ­guez</a>. Rodriguez was the number one-rated <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight" title="Middleweight">middleweight</a> boxer in the world and was training for his match with world champion Conor Scullion. Rourke boxed Scullion and claims to have received a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion" title="Concussion">concussion</a> in this sparring match.</p>

After being told by doctors to take a year off and rest, Rourke temporarily retired from the ring.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1971, as a senior at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach_Senior_High_School" title="Miami Beach Senior High School">Miami Beach Senior High School</a>, Rourke had a small acting role in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_W._Jensen" title="Jay W. Jensen">Jay W. Jensen</a>-directed school play, <i>The Serpent</i>. However, Rourke's interests were geared to boxing, and he never appeared in any other school productions. Soon after he temporarily gave up boxing, a friend at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Miami" title="University of Miami">University of Miami</a> told Rourke about a play he was directing, <i>Deathwatch</i>, and how the man playing the role of Green Eyes had quit. Rourke got the part and immediately became enamored with acting. Borrowing 400 dollars from his sister, he went to New York in order to take private lessons with an acting teacher from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actors_Studio" title="Actors Studio">Actors Studio</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Seacat" title="Sandra Seacat">Sandra Seacat</a>.</p>

However, it was his portrayal of an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson" title="Arson">arsonist</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Heat" title="Body Heat">Body Heat</a></i> that garnered significant attention, despite his modest time onscreen. He mostly appeared in television movies in his early career. During the early 1980s, Rourke starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner_(film)" title="Diner (film)">Diner</a></i>, alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Reiser" title="Paul Reiser">Paul Reiser</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Stern_(actor)" title="Daniel Stern (actor)">Daniel Stern</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Guttenberg" title="Steve Guttenberg">Steve Guttenberg</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Daly" title="Tim Daly">Tim Daly</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bacon" title="Kevin Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rourke's performance in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pope_of_Greenwich_Village" title="The Pope of Greenwich Village">The Pope of Greenwich Village</a></i> alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Hannah" title="Daryl Hannah">Daryl Hannah</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Roberts" title="Eric Roberts">Eric Roberts</a> also caught the attention of critics, although the film was not financially successful. In the mid-1980s, Rourke earned himself additional leading roles. His role alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Basinger" title="Kim Basinger">Kim Basinger</a> in the erotic drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9%C2%BD_Weeks" title="9Â½ Weeks">9Â½ Weeks</a></i> helped him gain "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_symbol" title="Sex symbol">sex symbol</a>" status.

In 1987, Rourke appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Heart_(film)" title="Angel Heart (film)">Angel Heart</a></i>. The film was nominated for several awards. It was seen as controversial by some owing to a sex scene involving <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosby_Show" title="Cosby Show">Cosby Show</a></i> cast member <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Bonet" title="Lisa Bonet">Lisa Bonet</a>, who won an award for her part in the film. Although some of Rourke's work was viewed as controversial in the U.S., he was well-received by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a>, and especially <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people" title="French people">French</a>, audiences, who loved the "rumpled, slightly dirty, sordid ... rebel persona" that he projected in <i>Year of the Dragon</i>, <i>9Â½ Weeks</i>, <i>Angel Heart</i>, and <i>Desperate Hours</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the late 1980s, Rourke performed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a> on the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Let_Me_Down" title="Never Let Me Down">Never Let Me Down</a></i> album. Around the same time he also wrote his first screenplay, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeboy_(film)" title="Homeboy (film)">Homeboy</a></i>, a boxing tale in which he starred. In 1989, Rourke starred in the docu-drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_(film)" title="Francesco (film)">Francesco</a></i>, portraying <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Francis_of_Assisi" title="St. Francis of Assisi">St. Francis of Assisi</a>. This was followed by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Orchid_(film)" title="Wild Orchid (film)">Wild Orchid</a></i>, another critically panned film, which gained him a nomination for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razzie_Award_for_Worst_Actor" title="Razzie Award for Worst Actor">Razzie</a> award (also for <i>Desperate Hours</i>). In 1991, he starred in the box office bomb <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Davidson_and_the_Marlboro_Man" title="Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man">Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man</a></i> as Harley Davidson, a biker whose best friend, Marlboro, was played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Johnson" title="Don Johnson">Don Johnson</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rourke's acting career eventually became overshadowed by his personal life and career decisions. Directors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Parker" title="Alan Parker">Alan Parker</a> found it difficult to work with him. Parker stated that "working with Mickey is a nightmare. He is very dangerous on the set because you never know what he is going to do." In a documentary on the special edition <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(film)" title="Tombstone (film)">Tombstone</a></i>, actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Biehn" title="Michael Biehn">Michael Biehn</a>, who plays the part of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Ringo" title="Johnny Ringo">Johnny Ringo</a>, mentions that his role was first offered to Rourke.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1991, Rourke decided that he "â€¦had to go back to boxing" because he felt that he "â€¦ was self-destructing â€¦ (and) had no respect for (himself as) an actor." Rourke was undefeated in eight fights, with six wins (four by knockout) and two draws. He fought as far away as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his boxing career, Rourke suffered a number of injuries, including a broken nose, toe, ribs, a split tongue, and a compressed cheekbone. He also suffered from short term memory loss.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His trainer during most of his boxing career was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_Angels" title="Hells Angels">Hells Angels</a> member <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Zito" title="Chuck Zito">Chuck Zito</a>,. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Roach" title="Freddie Roach">Freddie Roach</a> also trained Rourke for seven fights.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Boxing promoters said that Rourke was too old to succeed against top-level fighters. Indeed, Rourke himself admits that entering the ring was a sort of personal test: "(I) just wanted to give it a shot, test myself that way physically, while I still had time." In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, Rourke retired from boxing and returned to acting.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rourke's boxing career resulted in a notable physical change in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s" title="1990s">1990s</a>, as his face needed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery" title="Reconstructive surgery">reconstructive surgery</a> in order to mend his injuries.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite having withdrawn from acting at various points, and having made movies that he now sees as a creative "sell-out" (the action film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Davidson_and_the_Marlboro_Man" title="Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man">Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man</a></i>), Rourke has stated that "â€¦all that I have been throughâ€¦[has] made me a better, more interesting actor." Rourke's renewed interest in pursuing acting can be seen in his statement that "â€¦ my best work is still ahead of me."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rourke had a role in the movie version of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Informers" title="The Informers">The Informers</a></i>, playing Peter, an amoral former studio security guard who plots to kidnap a small child.</p>

However, as he trained for the film, he developed an appreciation and respect for what real-life pro wrestlers do to prepare for the ring:</p>

The couple reconciled and also starred together in <i>Exit in Red,</i> but their marriage ended in December 1998. In November 2007, Rourke was arrested again, this time on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence" title="Driving under the influence">DUI</a> charges in Miami Beach.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In numerous TV and print interviews, he attributes his comeback after fourteen years to weekly meetings with a psychiatrist, "Steve," and to a Catholic priest he identified as "Father Pete."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to his faith and his psychiatric treatment, Rourke has publicly attributed his comeback to his dogs. He is well-known as a pet fancier, particularly fond of small-breed dogs. A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutering" title="Neutering">spay/neuter</a> advocate, Rourke participated in a protest outside of a pet shop in 2007 and has done a public service announcement for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PETA" title="PETA">PETA</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His first little dog was reportedly a gift from his second wife. Though Rourke's dogs are generally referred to as "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua" title="Chihuahua">chihuahuas</a>," some are not pure-bred. Loki, his most-publicized dog whom he described as "the love of my life," was a chihuahua-terrier mix. So reliant was Rourke on Loki's companionship, he spent US$5,400 to have her flown to England while he was on the set of the film <i>Stormbreaker</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rourke gave his dogs credit during his Golden Globe Best Actor acceptance speech January 11, 2009: "I'd like to thank all my dogs. The ones that are here, the ones that aren't here anymore because sometimes when a man's alone, that's all you got is your dog. And they've meant the world to me." The day of the 2009 Golden Globes show, he told <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Walters" title="Barbara Walters">Barbara Walters</a> that "I sort of self-destructed and everything came out about fourteen years ago or so ... the wife had left, the career was over, the money was not an ounce. The dogs were there when no one else was there." Asked by Walters if he had considered suicide, he responded:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite being identified as "Lowjack" in the transcription above, the dog in the anecdote was apparently Beau Jack, who sired two of Rourke's later pets, Loki and her littermate Chocolate. Beau Jack died in 2002, though Rourke gave him 45 minutes of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Chocolate was the subject of a children's book, <i>Chocolate at the Four Seasons</i>, about his temporary stay with producer Bonnie Timmerman. Chocolate returned to Rourke and died in 2006. In addition to those dogs and several other past pets, Rourke currently owns a chihuahua named Jaws who appeared with him in his 2009 PETA ad, as well as in the movie "Man on Fire." He has had as many as seven dogs at one time, back in 2005. At the time of his Golden Globes tribute to his pets, Rourke owned five chihuahuas: Loki, Jaws, Ruby Baby, La Negra and Bella Loca. About a month later, on February 18, 2009, Loki died in Rourke's arms at the age of 18.</p>

He struggles to pay the rent for his trailer and his supermarket boss, Wayne (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Barry" title="Todd Barry">Todd Barry</a>), continually derides him. He also regularly visits a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_club" title="Strip club">strip club</a> where he has befriended a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striptease" title="Striptease">stripper</a>, Cassidy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisa_Tomei" title="Marisa Tomei">Marisa Tomei</a>). Though still beautiful she, like Randy, is getting old for her job. Randy agrees to a proposed 20th anniversary rematch in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware" title="Wilmington, Delaware">Wilmington</a> with his most notable opponent, "The Ayatollah" (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Miller" title="Ernest Miller">Ernest Miller</a>).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Randy steps up his training, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid" title="Steroid">steroid</a> injections.

Randy receives <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery" title="Coronary artery bypass surgery">coronary artery bypass surgery</a> and is told that his heart cannot take the stress of wrestling. He cancels his upcoming matches and takes an extra deli counter job at the supermarket. At Cassidy's suggestion, Randy visits his estranged adult daughter Stephanie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Rachel_Wood" title="Evan Rachel Wood">Evan Rachel Wood</a>), whom he abandoned when she was a child. She curses him for not being a supportive father and rejects him. When Cassidy meets with Randy to buy gifts for Stephanie, she reveals she has a son too, and Randy makes romantic advances on her which she rejects on the grounds of her job. Randy gives the gifts to his daughter and apologizes. The two bond over a visit to a beachfront boardwalk, and they agree to meet for dinner on the coming Saturday.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Randy goes to Cassidy's strip club to thank her but she once more rejects his romantic feelings, which results in an angry exchange. Upset, Randy spectates a wrestling match and receives friendly attention from fellow wrestlers. Randy gets drunk with them at a bar, snorts <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, and has sex with a woman. He sleeps the entire next day and misses his dinner with Stephanie. He goes to her house at night to apologize, but she cries and tells him to break it off permanently. At the supermarket deli counter, a patron recognizes him as The Ram. Randy gets agitated and cuts his hand, then creates chaos in the store and quits. Inspired by the patron and with nothing left, he decides to return to wrestling. He reschedules the rematch with The Ayatollah and reconciles with Cassidy, who warns him of his heart condition. However, he goes on stage, explaining to her and the crowd in an emotional statement that regardless of the real world, he truly belongs in the ring where he is loved and admired by his fans.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the match, Randy begins to feel heart pain and becomes unsteady, but continues nonetheless. The Ayatollah pressures Randy to pin him down and finish it, but Randy climbs the top rope. He prepares to deliver his signature finishing move, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_aerial_techniques#Diving_head_butt" title="Professional wrestling aerial techniques">diving head butt</a> (called "The Ram Jam"). In tears, he salutes the crowd and leaps.</p>

Alonso Duralde, of MSNBC, said, "Rourke's work transcends mere stunt-casting; his performance is a howl of pain that seems to come from a very real place."</p>

Although <i>The Wrestler</i> was not technically in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>'s "Best Films" list, he includes a note at the bottom of his review: "'The Wrestler' is one of the year's best films.

He asserted: "Randy â€œThe Ramâ€&#157; Robinson was a main-eventer who sold out Madison Square Garden. So was I... Although the film speaks superbly to the speed bumps all pro wrestlers navigate, Iâ€™m happy to report most of us donâ€™t swerve off the road quite so severely."
