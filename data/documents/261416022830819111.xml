				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Charles Laughton</b> (1 July 1899 – 15

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While best known for his historical roles in
					films, he started his career as a remarkable stage actor. During a time when
					many serious stage actors despised the motion picture medium, seeing it only as
					a source of income, Laughton showed keen and serious interest in the pioneering
					possibilities of film, and later other media, such as radio, recordings, and TV,
					proving that quality work could be made available to audiences other than
					theatre-goers. He became an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">American</a> citizen in 1950.</p>
			</wiki:abstract>

				England, the son of Robert Laughton by his wife Elizabeth (née Conlon). His mother
				was a devout <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> and he attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonyhurst_College" title="Stonyhurst College">Stonyhurst College</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> school, in
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire,_England" title="Lancashire, England">Lancashire, England</a>. He served during <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> (in which he was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare" title="Chemical warfare">gassed</a>) first with the 2/1st Battalion of the Huntingdonshire Cyclist

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He started work in the family hotel business,
				while participating in amateur theatricals in Scarborough. Finally allowed by his
				family to become a drama student at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADA" title="RADA">RADA</a> in 1925, Laughton
				made his first professional stage appearance on April 28, 1926 at the Barnes
				Theatre, as Osip in the comedy <i>The Government Inspector</i>, in which he also
				appeared at the London <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaiety_Theatre,_London" title="Gaiety Theatre, London">Gaiety Theatre</a> in May. Despite not having the
				looks for a romantic lead, he impressed audiences with his talent and played
				classical roles in two plays by Chekov, <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> and <i>The Three
					Sisters</i>. He played the title role in Arnold Bennett's <i>Mr Prohack</i>
				(Elsa Lanchester was also in the cast), Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot in
					<i>Alibi</i>, the title role in <i>Mr Pickwick</i> after Charles Dickens, Tony
				Perelli in Edgar Wallace's <i>On the Spot</i> and William Marble in <i>Payment
					Deferred</i>. He took this last play across the Atlantic and in it he made his
				debut in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">USA</a> on September 24, 1931, at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum_Theatre_(New_York)" title="Lyceum Theatre (New York)">Lyceum Theatre (New York)</a>. He returned to
				London for the 1933-34 Old Vic Season and was engaged in four Shakespeare roles (as
				Macbeth and Henry VIII, Angelo in <i>Measure for Measure</i> and Prospero in <i>The
					Tempest</i>). In 1936 he went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> and on May 9
				appeared at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedie_Francaise" title="Comedie Francaise">Comedie Francaise</a> as Sganarelle in the second act of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moliere" title="Moliere">Moliere</a>'s <i>Le
					Medecin malgré lui</i>, the first English actor to appear at that theatre, where
				he acted the part in French and received an ovation.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laughton commenced his film career in England
				while still acting on the London stage. He took small roles in three short silent
				comedies starring his wife <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Lanchester" title="Elsa Lanchester">Elsa
					Lanchester</a>, <i>Daydreams</i>, <i>Blue Bottles</i> and <i>The Tonic</i> (all
				1928) which had been specially written for her by H. G. Wells. He made a brief
				appearance as a disgruntled diner in another silent film <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccadilly_(film)" title="Piccadilly (film)">Piccadilly</a>
				</i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_May_Wong" title="Anna May Wong">Anna May Wong</a> in 1929. He appeared with Elsa
				Lanchester again in a "film revue," featuring assorted British variety acts, called <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comets" title="Comets">Comets</a>
				</i> (1930) in which they duetted in 'The Ballad of Frankie and Johnnie', and made
				two other early British talkies: <i>Wolves</i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Gish" title="Dorothy Gish">Dorothy
					Gish</a> (1930) from a play set in a whaling camp in the frozen north, and
					<i>Down River</i> (1931) in which he played a murderous, half-oriental
				drug-smuggler.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His New York stage debut in 1931 immediately led
				to film offers and Laughton's first Hollywood film was <i>

			<wiki:career>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laughton soon gave up the stage in

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Back in England, and again with Alexander
					Korda, he played the title role in <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt_(film)" title="Rembrandt (film)">Rembrandt</a>
					</i> (1936). In 1937, also for Korda, he starred in an ill-fated film version of

					outbreak of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, which implied the loss of many
					foreign markets, meant the end of the company.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laughton's film roles in the 1930s were
					among his finest and consisted almost entirely of the costume and historical
					drama parts for which he is best remembered (Nero, Henry VIII, Mr. Barrett,
					Captain Bligh, Rembrandt, Quasimodo and others). In his modern-dress film roles
					in his 1940s movies his acting style often led to variable results, particularly
					in a number of roles for which he was not ideally cast. He played an Italian
					vineyard owner in California in <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Knew_What_They_Wanted_(film)" title="They Knew What They Wanted (film)">They Knew What They Wanted</a>
					</i> (1940); a South Seas patriarch in <i>

							Under</a>
					</i> (1943).</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Still, some of these post-thirties
					performances could be remarkable when he came across a good script or a
					perceptive director, such is the case of a cowardly school-master in occupied
					France in <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Land_is_Mine" title="This Land is Mine">This Land is Mine</a>
					</i> (1943), by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Renoir" title="Jean Renoir">Jean

					was still working in an early script, Laughton would talk to him about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Daudet" title="Alphonse Daudet">Alphonse Daudet</a>'s story "The Last Lesson", which
					suggested to Renoir a relevant scene of the film.. He gave also an interesting
					portrait of a henpecked husband who eventually murders his wife in <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Suspect" title="The Suspect">The Suspect</a>
					</i> (1944), directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Siodmack&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Robert Siodmack (page does not exist)">Robert Siodmack</a>, who would
					become a good friend of Laughton. He played sympathetically an impoverished
					composer-pianist in <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Manhattan" title="Tales of Manhattan">Tales of Manhattan</a>
					</i>, and managed to transmit the eagerness of a little man who suddenly gets
					his only big chance to have success. He would also star in an up-dated version
					of Oscar Wilde's <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterville_Ghost" title="The Canterville Ghost">The Canterville Ghost</a>
					</i> (1944), and in spite of Wilde's original flavour being mangled in order to
					turn the story in a piece of wartime propaganda, he was able to recover irony
					and weary melancholia of the character as Wilde originally devised him.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apart from these, he would enjoy his work in
					two comedies he made with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deanna_Durbin" title="Deanna Durbin">Deanna Durbin</a>, <i>

						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradine_Case" title="The Paradine Case">The Paradine Case</a>

						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Clock_(1948_film)" title="The Big Clock (1948 film)">The Big Clock</a>
