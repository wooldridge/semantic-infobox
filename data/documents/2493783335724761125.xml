Her parents were "jobbing actors", which led Winslet to comment that she "didn't have a privileged upbringing" and that their daily life was "very hand to mouth". Her maternal grandparents, Linda (nÃ©e Plumb) and Archibald Oliver Bridges, founded and operated the Reading Repertory Theatre, and her uncle, Robert Bridges, appeared in the original <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" title="West End of London">West End</a> production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver!" title="Oliver!">Oliver!</a></i>.

Speaking about her experience on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_set" title="Film set">film set</a> as an absolute beginner, Winslet noted: "With <i>Heavenly Creatures</i>, all I knew I had to do was completely become that person. In a way it was quite nice doing [the film] and not knowing a bloody thing."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following year, Winslet auditioned for the small but pivotal role of Lucy Steele in the adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_Sensibility_(film)" title="Sense and Sensibility (film)">Sense and Sensibility</a></i>, featuring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thompson" title="Emma Thompson">Emma Thompson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant" title="Hugh Grant">Hugh Grant</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rickman" title="Alan Rickman">Alan Rickman</a>.

Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Lee" title="Ang Lee">Ang Lee</a> admitted he was initially worried about the way Winslet had attacked her role in <i>Heavenly Creatures</i> and thus required her to exercise <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi_chuan" title="Tai chi chuan">tai chi</a>, read Austen-era <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_novels" title="Gothic novels">Gothic novels</a> and poetry, and work with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a> teacher to fit the grace of the role. Budgeted at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$" title="US$">US$</a>16.5 million ($23.6 million in current year dollars) the film became a financial and critical success, resulting in a worldwide box office total of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$" title="US$">US$</a>135 million ($192.7 million) and various awards for Winslet, winning her both a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts" title="British Academy of Film and Television Arts">BAFTA</a> and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards" title="Screen Actors Guild Awards">Screen Actors Guild Award</a>, and nominations for both an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1996, Winslet starred in both <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_(film)" title="Jude (film)">Jude</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(1996_film)" title="Hamlet (1996 film)">Hamlet</a></i>. In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Winterbottom" title="Michael Winterbottom">Michael Winterbottom</a>'s <i>Jude</i>, based on the Victorian novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_the_Obscure" title="Jude the Obscure">Jude the Obscure</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy" title="Thomas Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>, she played Sue Bridehead, a young woman with suffragette leanings who falls in love with her cousin, played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Eccleston" title="Christopher Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a>. Acclaimed among critics, it was not a success at the box office, barely grossing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$" title="US$">US$</a>2 million ($2.8 million) worldwide. Richard Corliss of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)"><i>Time</i> magazine</a> said "Winslet is worthy of [...] the camera's scrupulous adoration. She's perfect, a modernist ahead of her time [...] and <i>Jude</i> is a handsome showcase for her gifts." Winslet played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophelia_(character)" title="Ophelia (character)">Ophelia</a>, Hamlet's drowned lover, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Branagh" title="Kenneth Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a>'s all star-cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_on_screen" title="Shakespeare on screen">film version</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a></i>. The film garnered largely positive reviews and earned Winslet her second <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_Empire_Awards" title="Sony Ericsson Empire Awards">Empire Award</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In mid-1996, Winslet began filming <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron" title="James Cameron">James Cameron</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a></i> (1997), alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio" title="Leonardo DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>.

"<i>Titanic</i> was totally different and nothing could have prepared me for it. ... We were really scared about the whole adventure. ... Jim [Cameron] is a perfectionist, a real genius at making movies. But there was all this bad press before it came out, and that was really upsetting." Against expectations, the film went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time, grossing more than <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">US$</a>1.843 billion ($2.6 billion) in box-office receipts worldwide, and transformed Winslet into a commercial movie star.

Winslet had rejected offers to play the leading roles in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_Love" title="Shakespeare in Love">Shakespeare in Love</a></i> (1998) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_and_the_King" title="Anna and the King">Anna and the King</a></i> (1999) in favour of the role of a young English mother named Julia who moves with her daughters from London to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> hoping to start a new life. The film garnered generally mixed reviews and received only limited distribution, resulting in a worldwide gross of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$" title="US$">US$</a>5 million ($6.5 million). Despite the success of <i>Titanic</i>, the next film Winslet opted to star in was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Smoke!" title="Holy Smoke!">Holy Smoke!</a></i> (1999), featuring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Keitel" title="Harvey Keitel">Harvey Keitel</a>, another low-budget projectâ€”much to the chagrin of her agents, who felt "miserable" about her preference of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_film" title="Art film">arthouse</a> movies. Feeling pressured, Winslet has said she "never saw <i>Titanic</i> as a springboard for bigger films or bigger pay cheques", knowing that "it could have been that, but would have destroyed [her]."

The procedure is performed exclusively by <i>Lacuna Incorporated</i>. The characters of Joel and Clementine used this procedure to erase their memories of each other. As part of the screenwriting and promotion for the film, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstory" title="Backstory">backstory</a> for the technology was made, including a spoof website for "Lacuna, Inc." that described it.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though the procedure in the film is fictional, recent research has shown it is possible to successfully erase selective memories in lab mice.

      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>The picture quality and sound resolution of the memory simply deteriorate (one example being when Joel talks with his neighbor in the lobby of their apartment building).</li>
	<li>Use of very limited <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_lighting" title="Stage lighting">stage lighting</a> (such as when Clementine is pulled away from Joel in the train station).</li>
	<li>Subtle details fade from view (examples of this being when Clementine's name fades away from the Lacuna postcard that Joel has in his hand or when the books in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_and_Noble" title="Barnes and Noble">Barnes and Noble</a> gradually turn white).</li>
	<li>In one case, time and perspective seem to "loop" (the scene where Joel tries to make up with Clementine after she stormed out of his apartment, Joel finds himself unable to get from one end of the street to anotherÂ â€“ this also combines the elimination of details such as the displays of stores. Also in this scene, we repeatedly see reflections of the lamp in Joel's apartment floating in the air).</li>
	<li>Overt disintegration of the memories (examples of this include the car falling from the sky, the disappearance of a car that Joel and Clementine are in, the disappearance of a fence, a scene where they run through a train station with the people there "winking out", and perhaps most elaborately, the falling apart of the beach house that Joel and Clementine were in).</li>
	<li>Heavy sound and image distortion, faces appearing blank (when Joel and Clementine enter the erased memory of Joel speaking to Dr. Mierzwiak).</li>
	<li>Cycling between the adult actors and their younger selves (when Joel recalls a humiliating memory of being forced by bullies to hit a dead bird with a hammer, the footage switches back and forth between young actors playing Joel and Clementine and Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey. Joel is apparently able to visualize Clementine's youthful appearance because he had seen a picture of her as that when they were still together).</li>

(Examples are when Joel and Clementine are in the kitchen sink, or when Joel hides from his mother and a neighbor/Clementine under the table in his memory as a child.)</li>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dropped scenes included dialogue on the train, dialogue in Clementine's apartment, scenes with Joel and Naomi (the girlfriend he had before Clementine, portrayed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Pompeo" title="Ellen Pompeo">Ellen Pompeo</a>), Joel in the Lacuna office describing his negative feelings about Clementine in more detail, and scenes showing Joel and Clementine on their first "date". The dialogue from the deleted Lacuna office scene is used later, when he is listening to a tape of himself describing Clementine's personality flaws, and brief moments of the cut scene showing their first "date" are mixed in with the jumble of memories Joel sees of Clementine as the erasure process comes to an end. In fact, much of the content of the film was moved around in editing. A fair amount of scenes were changed on-the-spot by director Michel Gondry, including scenes showing the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_%26_Bailey_Circus" title="Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus">Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus</a> in the streets of Manhattan. Another dropped scene was one that took place in a bar where a very drunk Clementine tried to make Joel jealous by coming onto another man (which might have prompted Joel's claim in his taped interview with Mierzwiak that Clementine was very promiscuous). Another deleted scene that appears in the special two-disc DVD set is an extended scene in the doctor's office when Mary Svevo is listening to the tape of her file. Mary is saying in the tape why she should have the procedure done, especially after having to get an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a>. Yet another showed Joel and Clementine reading the mystery novel "The Red Right Hand" together on his couch (which in the novel Clementine is seen reading in the diner at Montauk where she and Joel (re)meet for the first time.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> was met with overwhelmingly universal acclaim, and Winslet's performance was generally praised. Many critics cited the film as the "best movie of the decade". The film has a 93% certified fresh rating on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> website based on 216 reviews. The consensus is that the film is "a twisty, trippy, yet moving take on love, Kaufman-style."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> commented, "Despite jumping through the deliberately disorienting hoops of its story, <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> has an emotional center, and that's what makes it work." Ebert later included the film in his "Great Movies" series.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_(company)" title="Time Out (company)">Time Out</a></i> summed up their review by saying, "the formidable Gondry/Kaufman/Carrey axis works marvel after marvel in expressing the bewildering beauty and existential horror of being trapped inside one's own addled mind, and in allegorising the self-preserving amnesia of a broken but hopeful heart."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2006, in issue 201 of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(magazine)" title="Empire (magazine)"><i>Empire</i> magazine</a>, <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> was voted #83 in their <i>201 Greatest Movies of All Time poll</i> as voted for by the readers. That same year, Winslet's performance as Clementine was included in <i>Premiere</i> magazine's 100 Greatest Performances of All Time at #81. Claudia Puig, reviewer of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> said about her performance that "Winslet is wonderful as a free spirit whose hair color changes along with her moods.

In December 2009, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV_Club" title="AV Club">AV Club</a> declared the film the best of the decade. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slant_Magazine" title="Slant Magazine">Slant Magazine</a> placed the film at number 87 on their list of the best films of the 2000s.</p>
