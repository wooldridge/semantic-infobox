His mother was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_people" title="Khmer people">Khmer</a> and his father was of Chinese descent. Ngor and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Russell" title="Harold Russell">Harold Russell</a> are the only two non-professional actors to win an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> in an acting category. As of 2010, Ngor remains the only Asian to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Born in Samrong Young, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, Ngor trained as a surgeon and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecologist" title="Gynecologist">gynecologist</a>. He was practicing in the capital, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh" title="Phnom Penh">Phnom Penh</a>, in 1975 when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot" title="Pol Pot">Pol Pot</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> seized control of the country and proclaimed it <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Kampuchea" title="Democratic Kampuchea">Democratic Kampuchea</a>. He was compelled to conceal his education, medical skills, and even the fact that he wore <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectacles" title="Spectacles">glasses</a> to avoid the new regime's intense hostility to intellectuals and professionals. He was expelled from Phnom Penh along with the bulk of its two million inhabitants as part of the Khmer Rouge's "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Zero_(political_notion)" title="Year Zero (political notion)">Year Zero</a>" social experiment and imprisoned in a concentration camp along with his wife, My-Huoy, who subsequently died giving birth. Although a gynecologist, he was unable to treat his wife who required a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesarean_section" title="Cesarean section">Cesarean section</a> as he would have been exposed and both he and his wife (as well as the child) would very probably have been killed. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Ngor worked as a doctor in a refugee camp in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and left with his niece for the United States on August 30, 1980. Ngor was not able to resume medical practice in the U.S. He never remarried.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1988, he wrote <i>Haing Ngor: A Cambodian Odyssey</i>, describing his life under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In the second edition of <i>Survival in the Killing Fields,</i> Roger Warner, Ngor's co-author, adds an epilogue telling the story of Ngor's life after winning the Academy Award.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The "Dr. Haing S. Ngor Foundation" was founded in his honor in 1997 to assist in raising funds for Cambodian aid. As part of his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian" title="Humanitarian">humanitarian</a> efforts, Ngor built an elementary school and operated a small sawmill that provided jobs and an income for local families. Ngor's niece, Sophia Ngor Demetri, who testified at the trial of his murderers and with whom he arrived to the U.S., is the current President of the Foundation.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <a href="http://www.haingngorfoundation.org/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Haing S.

The two actors met in 1989 while filming "The Iron Triangle" and soon after, Pastor Ong's church (Venice Christian Community in Venice, CA) launched Project Cambodia to raise funds to care for orphans and help rebuild the devastated country's infrastructure. Project Cambodia was the original foundation for The Dr. Haing S. Ngor Foundation, which was incorporated in 1997 after Ngor's homicide (Feb. 25, 1996) as a 501 (C) (3) charitable organization. The goals of the Foundation include preserving the legacy of Ngor's accomplishments and human rights endeavors as well as the promotion of Cambodia's history and culture through education, activism and the arts. Ngor's niece, Sophia Ngor Demetri, who testified at the trial of his murderers and whom he brought to the U.S., is the current President of the Foundation; Ong serves as Executive Director.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Murder">Murder</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On February 25, 1996, Ngor was shot dead outside his home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="Chinatown, Los Angeles, California">Chinatown</a>, in downtown <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>. Ngor was buried at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Hills_Memorial_Park" title="Rose Hills Memorial Park">Rose Hills Memorial Park</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittier,_California" title="Whittier, California">Whittier, California</a>. Many Cambodians claimed they had a stake in his estate, with one woman claiming he had married her after coming to the United States. Most of Ngor's Cambodian assets went to his brother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Sarun" title="Chan Sarun">Chan Sarun</a>, while his American assets were used up in legal fees staving off claims to his estate.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Charged with the murder were three reputed members of the "Oriental Lazy Boyz" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_gang" title="Street gang">street gang</a> who had a prior history of snatching purses and jewelry. They were tried together in the Superior Court of Los Angeles, though their cases were heard by three separate juries. Prosecutors argued that they killed Ngor because, after handing over his gold <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex" title="Rolex">Rolex</a> watch willingly, he refused to give them a locket that contained a photo of his deceased wife, My-Huoy. Defense attorneys suggested the murder was a politically motivated killing carried out by sympathizers of the Khmer Rouge but offered no evidence to support this theory. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Kek_Iew" title="Kang Kek Iew">Kang Kek Iew</a>, a former Khmer Rouge official on trial in Cambodia, claimed in November 2009 that Ngor was murdered on Pol Pot's orders, but U.S. investigators did not find him credible.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some criticized the theory that Ngor was killed in a bungled robbery, pointing to $2,900 in cash that had been left behind and the fact that the thieves had not rifled his pockets. Why the thieves would have demanded his locket has never been answered; Ngor typically wore the locket next to his skin under his clothing, so it would not have been in plain sight. As of 2003, the locket has not been recovered.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All three were found guilty on April 16, 1998, the same day Pol Pot's death was confirmed in Cambodia. Tak Sun Tan was sentenced to 56 years to life; Indra Lim to 26 years to life; and Jason Chan to life without parole. In 2004, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._District_Court_for_the_Central_District_of_California" title="U.S. District Court for the Central District of California">U.S. District Court for the Central District of California</a> granted Tak Sun Tan's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus" title="Habeas corpus">habeas corpus</a></i> petition, finding that prosecutors had manipulated the jury's sympathy by presenting false evidence. This decision was reversed, and the conviction was ultimately upheld by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> in July 2005.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the release of <i>The Killing Fields</i>, Ngor had told a <i>New York Times</i> reporter, "If I die from now on, OK! This film will go on for a hundred years."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dith_Pran" title="Dith Pran">Dith Pran</a>, whom Ngor portrayed in <i>The Killing Fields</i>, said of Ngor's death, "He is like a twin with me. He is like a co-messenger and right now I am alone."</p>

They do not leave Phnom Penh, but instead retreat to the French embassy and stay there for several days, awaiting their chance to evacuate.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several months after returning to New York City, Schanberg is in the midst of a personal campaign to locate Pran. He has appealed to many humanitarian organisations and has kept in close contact with Pran's family in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. In Cambodia, Pran has become a forced labourer under the Khmer Rouge's "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Zero_(political_notion)" title="Year Zero (political notion)">Year Zero</a>" policy, a return to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian" title="Agrarian">agrarian</a> ways of the past. Pran labours in rice fields under the watchful eyes of young children of both sexes, whom the Khmer Rouge hold in high regard as the future leaders of their regime. Pran is also forced to attend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda" title="Propaganda">propagandist</a> classes where many undergo re-education. As <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual" title="Intellectual">intellectuals</a> are made to disappear, Pran feigns simple-mindedness. Eventually, he tries to escape, but is recaptured. Before he is found by members of the Khmer Rouge, he stumbles upon the infamous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_Fields" title="The Killing Fields">killing fields</a> of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot" title="Pol Pot">Pol Pot</a> regime, where millions of Cambodian citizens were murdered by the new order.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pran is assigned to the leader of a different prison compound, a man named Phat, and charged mostly with tending to his little boy. Pran continues his self-imposed discipline of behaving as an uneducated peasant, despite several of Phatâ€™s attempts to trick him into revealing his knowledge of both French and English. Phat begins to trust Pran and asks him to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed. The Khmer Rouge are now engaged in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War" title="Cambodianâ€“Vietnamese War">border war with Vietnam</a>. The conflict reaches Pran's region and a battle ensues between the Khmer Rouge of the compound and two jets sent to destroy the camp. After the skirmish has ended, Pran discovers that Phat's son has American money and a map leading to safety. When Phat tries to stop the younger Khmer Rouge officers from killing several of his comrades, he is ignominiously shot.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the confusion, Pran escapes with four other prisoners and they begin a long trek through the jungle with Phatâ€™s young son. The group later splits and three of them head in a different direction; Pran continues following the map with one of them. However, Pranâ€™s companion steps on a hidden <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_mine" title="Land mine">land mine</a> while holding the child. Though Pran pleads with the man to give him the child, the mine goes off, killing them both. Pran mourns for a time and continues on. One day he crests the escarpment of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangrek_Mountains" title="Dangrek Mountains">Dangrek Mountains</a> and sees a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement" title="International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement">Red Cross</a> camp near the border of Thailand. The scene shifts to Schanberg calling Pran's family with the news that Pran is alive and safe. Soon after, Schanberg travels to the Red Cross camp and is reunited with Pran. Asking Pran to forgive him, Pran answers, with a smile, "Nothing to forgive, Sydney", as the two embrace.</p>
