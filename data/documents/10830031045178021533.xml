	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The screenplay was adapted from both Lionel Bart's play and Dickens's novel. The screenplay was written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Harris" title="Vernon Harris">Vernon Harris</a>, and the film was directed by Sir <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Reed" title="Carol Reed">Carol Reed</a>, who was also Oliver Reed's uncle. A few of the songs from the stage production were not used in the movie, although they often make appearances in the incidental music. For example, the music of Sikes' song "My Name" can be heard when the character first appears, and several other times whenever he is about to commit some nefarious deed.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film also included extended choreography sequences not found in the original show, and some additional scenes which expanded the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Sikes" title="Bill Sikes">Bill Sikes</a>, making him closer to the Sikes of the original Dickens novel. In the stage version, he did not even make his entrance until the second act. The songs that Sikes sang in the stage version were omitted.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The beginning section of Dickens's novel, which showed Oliver's pregnant mother making her way to the workhouse and dying after Oliver is born, was added to the screenplay and filmed, but was eventually omitted before the film's release, partly because of time length, and partly because the producers chose instead to begin the film at the point in which the original stage musical starts - with the boys marching down to eat their gruel and singing <i>Food Glorious Food</i>.The still photos of the omitted section exist in the "Oliver" storybook, published in 1968.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this same <i>Oliver!</i> storybook, Nancy has a final moment in which, after being fatally beaten by Bill Sikes, she gasps out her dying words to Mr. Brownlow, but there is nothing to indicate that this was actually filmed, so it may have been dramatic license on the part of the authors of the storybook. However, when Brownlow runs down the steps of London Bridge toward Nancy, she is clearly still alive - her feet are seen to be moving. The film, rather than following through on this, then cuts away to a scene showing Sikes trying to kill his bull terrier for fear that the dog may lead the police to him, and when the film returns again to Brownlow, Nancy has supposedly already died.</p>

      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>In the film, the song "I Shall Scream," between Mr. Bumble and Widow Corney is omitted.</li>
	<li>In the film, the song "My Name", which is sung by Bill Sykes in the play, is omitted</li>
	<li>"That's Your Funeral" sung by Mr and Mrs Sowerberry is omitted from the film</li>
	<li>"It's a Fine Life" is not performed in the Three Cripples pub in the stage production. In the film adaption it is Nancy describing her feelings for Bill and her life while in the stage play it's a description of how Nancy, along with Bet and the boys, don't mind a bit of danger.</li>
	<li>Oliver's trial and exoneration after being arrested for stealing Brownlow's wallet were shown, with Nancy secretly attending it. (In the play, Nancy does not attend Oliver's trial, which takes place offstage - presumably between Acts I and II.) Nearly all of the dialogue in this sequence was taken directly from Dickens's novel. The magistrate Mr. Fang, who does not appear in the stage musical, was added to the film, identified simply as "The Magistrate" , and portrayed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Griffith" title="Hugh Griffith">Hugh Griffith</a> in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance" title="Cameo appearance">cameo appearance</a>. The magistrate, rather than being depicted as cruel, as in Dickens's novel, was played with a humorous touch as an incompetent drunkard who is so hungover that he is scarcely aware of the goings-on inside the courtroom.</li>
	<li>Oliver is a horrified witness to the murder of Nancy, while in the stage production Sikes knocks him temporarily unconscious so that he can commit the crime without a witness.</li>
	<li>The song "Oom Pah Pah" was moved to a late spot in the second act of the film, rather than being placed at the beginning of the second act. In the play, it is simply a song sung by Nancy just for entertainment; in the film she sings it as a ruse to divert Bill Sikes's attention and get the tavern crowd dancing, so that she can use it as camouflage to sneak Oliver to London Bridge and back to Mr. Brownlow. The ruse, of course, fails - Bill's bull terrier, who had been guarding Oliver, begins to bark and alerts him. Bill secretly follows them and surprises them at the bridge.</li>
	<li>Bet, Nancy's best friend, who also works at the tavern, is not seen again in the film after the song "Oom-Pah-Pah", while in the show, she is among the crowd at London Bridge which discovers Nancy's body after Sikes has murdered her, and she breaks down in tears. Some sources describe her as being Nancy's sister in the stage version (although in the Dickens novel, as in the film, she is simply Nancy's best friend).</li>
	<li>The film contains a scene in which Sikes forces Oliver to help him burgle a house. The scene, not found in the original stage version, is taken from a similar episode in the Dickens novel; however, the outcome is slightly different.</li>
	<li>Sikes' final attempt to escape does not take place at London Bridge as in the stage version, but on the rooftops of London, as the crowd below watches while Sikes forces Oliver to balance himself on a dangerously thin wooden hoist and loop a rope around it so that he (Sikes) can swing from one rooftop to another. The idea of Sikes taking Oliver as a hostage over the rooftop was taken, not from Dickens's novel, but from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lean" title="David Lean">David Lean</a>'s 1948 film version of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, although in the Lean film, Oliver tied the rope to a chimney, instead of looping it over a hoist. Lean was, according to one of his biographers, deeply hurt that a fellow director whom he regarded highly (Carol Reed) would borrow a significant plot development from him without acknowledging it in the film's credits (the credits for <i>Oliver!</i> merely say <i>Screenplay by Vernon Harris freely adapted from Charles Dickens's "Oliver Twist"</i>). In the Lean film, Sikes is wounded, and the pain causes him to lose his grip and accidentally hang himself; in <i>Oliver!</i>, when Sikes is shot, the rope is around his waist rather than his neck; the shot itself kills him, so he does not hang himself.</li>
	<li>The so-called "fourth wall" finale, in which all the characters sang a medley of three of the songs, was completely eliminated so as to not destroy the impact of the final scenes, although Fagin and the Artful Dodger are last seen humorously reprising "Reviewing the Situation" (with additional lyrics written for the film), and dancing off happily to continue their life of crime. The closing credits are seen against a replay of part of the "Consider Yourself" sequence, in which we see the chorus singing and dancing.</li>
	<li>Although Sikes clubs Nancy to death, as in the original Dickens novel as well as the London and Broadway productions of the show, he kills her with both blocked by the bridge. In the stage production, because of the set design, the actors are always in full view of the audience, so the beating had to be staged in a highly artificial way (with no blood). Later productions have changed it so that she is strangled, making the scene more realistic, while others honour the beating but have it so the bridge blocks Nancy from view.</li>
	<li>The film adds a poignant moment seconds before Nancy is killed by Sikes at London Bridge. Nancy and Oliver share a farewell embrace; Sikes then appears and grabs both of them, flings Nancy aside and attempts to run off with Oliver but Nancy attacks Sikes to stop him from taken Oliver, which angers him even more and leads to her murder. Some of this is now retained in some stage productions of the musical.</li>
	<li>Three songs, "Boy for Sale", "Where Is Love", and "Reviewing the Situation" had added extra lyrics in the film version. For "Boy for Sale", an extra verse, including a faster melody in the bridge section of the song, was added, including a slower section, as Mr. Bumble tries to auction off Oliver, at three pounds ten, with the words: "GOING, GOING,"; however, with nobody wanting to bid for the boy, sings the word: "GONE." The added section to "Where is Love" begins: <i>Every night I kneel and pray/ Let tomorrow be the day</i>, etc. The reprise of "Reviewing the Situation" is, as previously mentioned, longer and more humorous, as Fagin and the Dodger decide to continue their life of crime.</li>
	<li>Most of the choreography was greatly expanded for the film. The stage version featured very simplistic dancing.</li>
	<li>the Old Sally scene from the play is omitted with Mrs Bumble having kept the locket herself</li>
	<li>The stage production honours the novel in having Nancy take Oliver back posing as his aggrieved sister. In the film she takes him aside and seemingly convinces him to follow her a little way, here Sikes puts a bag over his head.</li>
