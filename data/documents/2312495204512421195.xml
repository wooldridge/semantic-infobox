      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Burton Stephen "Burt" Lancaster</b> (November 2, 1913 â€“ October 20, 1994) was an American film actor noted for his athletic physique, distinctive smile (which he called "The Grin") and, later, his willingness to play roles that went against his initial "tough guy" image. Initially dismissed as "Mr Muscles and Teeth." in the late 1950s Lancaster abandoned his "all-American" image and gradually came to be regarded as one of the best actors of his generation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster was nominated four times for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a> and won once, for his work in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Gantry_(film)" title="Elmer Gantry (film)">Elmer Gantry</a></i> in 1960. He also won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> for that performance, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award" title="BAFTA Award">BAFTA Awards</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdman_of_Alcatraz_(film)" title="Birdman of Alcatraz (film)">The Birdman of Alcatraz</a></i> (1962) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_City_(1980_film)" title="Atlantic City (1980 film)">Atlantic City</a></i> (1980). His production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, was the most successful and innovative star-driven independent production company in 1950s Hollywood, making movies such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty" title="Marty">Marty</a></i> (1955), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapeze_(film)" title="Trapeze (film)">Trapeze</a></i> (1956), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Smell_of_Success" title="Sweet Smell of Success">Sweet Smell of Success</a></i> (1957).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster also ventured in directing, with two films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kentuckian" title="The Kentuckian">The Kentuckian</a></i> (1955) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Man_(1974_film)" title="The Midnight Man (1974 film)">The Midnight Man</a></i> (1974).</p>

Lancaster was the son of Elizabeth (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Roberts) and James Henry Lancaster, who was a postman. Both of his parents were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism" title="Protestantism">Protestants</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working-class" title="Working-class">working-class</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people" title="Irish people">Irish</a> origin, with Lancaster's grandparents having been immigrants to the U.S. from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> and descendants of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people" title="English people">English</a> immigrants to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Lancaster's family believed themselves to be related to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Roberts,_1st_Earl_Roberts" title="Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts">Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts</a>; their surname originates from 11th century <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people" title="French people">French</a> immigrants to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> with the surname "de Lancastre". Lancaster grew up in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Harlem" title="East Harlem">East Harlem</a> and spent much of his time on the streets, where he developed great interest and skill in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics" title="Gymnastics">gymnastics</a> while attending the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeWitt_Clinton_High_School" title="DeWitt Clinton High School">DeWitt Clinton High School</a>. Before he graduated from DeWitt Clinton, where he was a basketball star, his mother died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Lancaster was accepted into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University" title="New York University">New York University</a> with an athletics scholarship, but subsequently dropped out to focus on his first career choice.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Circus_career_and_military">Circus career and military</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the age of 9, Lancaster met <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cravat" title="Nick Cravat">Nick Cravat</a>, with whom he continued to work throughout his life. Together they learned to act in local theater productions and also circus arts at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Settlement_Association" title="Union Settlement Association">Union Settlement</a>, one of the city's oldest settlement houses. They formed the acrobat duo "Lang and Cravat" and soon joined the Kay Brothers circus. However in 1939, an injury would force Lancaster to give up the profession, with great despair. (He would later be reunited with Cravat in nine films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flame_and_the_Arrow" title="The Flame and the Arrow">The Flame and the Arrow</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crimson_Pirate" title="The Crimson Pirate">The Crimson Pirate</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_Silent_Run_Deep" title="Run Silent Run Deep">Run Silent Run Deep</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scalphunters" title="The Scalphunters">The Scalphunters</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_(1970_film)" title="Airport (1970 film)">Airport</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdez_Is_Coming" title="Valdez Is Coming">Valdez Is Coming</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulzana%27s_Raid" title="Ulzana's Raid">Ulzana's Raid</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Man_(1974_film)" title="The Midnight Man (1974 film)">The Midnight Man</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Dr._Moreau_(1977_film)" title="The Island of Dr. Moreau (1977 film)">The Island of Dr. Moreau</a></i>.) He then found temporary work, first as a salesman for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Fields" title="Marshall Fields">Marshall Fields</a>, and then as a singing waiter in various restaurants, until 1942.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though initially unenthusiastic about acting, he returned from service, auditioned for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> play and was offered a role. Although <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brown_(writer)" title="Harry Brown (writer)">Harry Brown</a>'s <i>A Sound of Hunting</i> was not successful, Lancaster's performance drew the attention of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> agent, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hecht" title="Harold Hecht">Harold Hecht</a>, who introduced him to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Wallis" title="Hal Wallis">Hal Wallis</a> who cast Lancaster in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killers_(1946_film)" title="The Killers (1946 film)">The Killers</a></i> (1946). (Hecht and Lancaster later formed several production companies in the 50's to give Lancaster greater creative control.) The tall, muscular actor won significant acclaim and appeared in two more films the following year. Subsequently, he played in a variety of films, especially in dramas, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)" title="Thriller (genre)">thrillers</a>, and military and adventure films. In two, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flame_and_the_Arrow" title="The Flame and the Arrow">The Flame and the Arrow</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crimson_Pirate" title="The Crimson Pirate">The Crimson Pirate</a>,</i> a friend from his circus years, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cravat" title="Nick Cravat">Nick Cravat</a>, played a key supporting role, and both actors impressed audiences with their acrobatic prowess.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1953, Lancaster played one of his best remembered roles with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Kerr" title="Deborah Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Here_to_Eternity" title="From Here to Eternity">From Here to Eternity</a>.</i> The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which he and Deborah Kerr make love on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaiian</a> beach amid the crashing waves. The organization named it one of "AFI's top 100 Most Romantic Films" of all time. In the mid-1950s, Lancaster went on challenging himself with varied cinematic roles, and he satisfied longtime aspirations by forming a film production partnership, Hecht-Lancaster Productions (eventually <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hecht" title="Harold Hecht">Hecht</a>-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hill_(film_producer)" title="James Hill (film producer)">Hill</a>-Lancaster Productions) as well, having a pioneering role in the development of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_cinema" title="Independent cinema">independent cinema</a>. His work was recognized in 1960 when he won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe Award</a>, and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Critics_Award" title="New York Film Critics Award">New York Film Critics Award</a> for his performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Gantry_(film)" title="Elmer Gantry (film)">Elmer Gantry</a>.</i> In 1968, at the age of 52, Lancaster appeared nude in director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Perry" title="Frank Perry">Frank Perry</a>'s film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swimmer_(film)" title="The Swimmer (film)">The Swimmer</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster made several films over the years with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Walk_Alone" title="I Walk Alone">I Walk Alone</a></i> (1948), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfight_at_the_OK_Corral_(1957_film)" title="Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957 film)">Gunfight at the OK Corral</a></i> (1957), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Disciple_(1959_film)" title="The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)">The Devil's Disciple</a></i> (1959), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_in_May" title="Seven Days in May">Seven Days in May</a></i> (1964), which fixed the notion of the pair as something of a team in the public imagination. The notion was firmly cemented by the time Lancaster and Douglas reteamed for their final movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tough_Guys" title="Tough Guys">Tough Guys</a></i> (1986). Douglas was always second-billed under Lancaster in these films, but with the exception of <i>I Walk Alone,</i> in which Douglas played a villain, their roles were usually more or less the same size.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the later part of his career, Lancaster left adventure and acrobatic movies behind and portrayed more distinguished characters. This period brought him work on several European productions, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">directors</a> such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luchino_Visconti" title="Luchino Visconti">Luchino Visconti</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Bertolucci" title="Bernardo Bertolucci">Bernardo Bertolucci</a>. Lancaster sought demanding roles and, if he liked a part or a director, was prepared to work for much lower pay than he might have earned elsewhere; he even helped to finance movies whose artistic value he believed in. He also mentored directors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Pollack" title="Sydney Pollack">Sydney Pollack</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frankenheimer" title="John Frankenheimer">John Frankenheimer</a> and appeared in several TV films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Lancaster has a star on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster was an early and successful actor/producer. He formed his own production company, Hecht-Lancaster (later Hecht-Hill-Lancaster), and directed two films, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kentuckian" title="The Kentuckian">The Kentuckian</a></i> in 1955 and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Man_(1974_film)" title="The Midnight Man (1974 film)">The Midnight Man</a></i> in 1974.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster vigorously guarded his private life. He was married three times. His first two marriages ended in divorce â€” to June Ernst from 1935 to 1946 and to Norma Anderson from 1946 to 1969. His third marriage, to Susan Martin, was from September 1990 until his death in 1994. All five of his children were with Norma Anderson: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Lancaster" title="Bill Lancaster">Bill</a> (who became a screenwriter), James, Susan, Joanna, and Sighle (pronounced Sheila). He claims he was romantically involved with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Kerr" title="Deborah Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a> during the filming of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Here_to_Eternity" title="From Here to Eternity">From Here to Eternity</a></i> in 1953. However Ms. Kerr had stated that while there was a spark of attraction, nothing ever happened. He also had an affair with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Blondell" title="Joan Blondell">Joan Blondell</a>. In her 1980 autobiography, actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Winters" title="Shelley Winters">Shelley Winters</a> claimed to have had a long affair with him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster was a vocal supporter of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> political causes, and frequently spoke out with support for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_minorities" title="Racial minorities">racial minorities</a>. He was also instrumental in the formation of many liberal groups, through financial support. At one point, he was rumored to be a member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA" title="Communist Party USA">Communist Party</a>, because of his involvement in many liberal causes.

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robert Stroud (Lancaster) is imprisoned as a young man for committing a murder in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. He is shown as a rebellious inmate, fighting against a rigid prison system: on his way to jail by train he breaks open the window to allow the suffocating inmates to breathe. His rebellious attitude puts him in conflict with Harvey Shoemaker (Malden), the warden of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Penitentiary,_Leavenworth" title="United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth">Leavenworth Prison</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While in jail, Stroud learns that his mother (Ritter) tried to visit him but was denied and told to return later in the week. Outraged, he attacks a guard over the issue and the man is killed. Stroud is sentenced to death, but his mother runs a successful campaign and it is commuted to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_in_prison" title="Life in prison">life in prison</a>. The terms of the sentence require that he be kept in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement" title="Solitary confinement">solitary confinement</a> for the rest of his life.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To break the monotony, Stroud adopts a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrow" title="Sparrow">sparrow</a> as a pet. This starts a trend and he and the other convicts acquire birds, such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaries" title="Canaries">canaries</a>, as gifts from the outside. Before long, Stroud has built up a collection of birds and cages. When they fall ill, he makes experiments and comes up with a cure. As the years pass, Stroud becomes an expert on bird diseases and even publishes a book on the subject. His writings are so impressive that a doctor describes him as a "genius".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stroud later meets bird-lover Stella Johnson (Field) and agrees to go into business, marketing his bird remedies. He and Stella later marry, but his mother disapproves and this causes a rift between mother and son. He is abruptly transferred to the federal <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison" title="Prison">penitentiary</a> at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz" title="Alcatraz">Alcatraz</a> (the "Rock"), a new maximum security institution where he is not permitted to keep birds. He is now growing elderly but still shows a rebellious side, writing a history of the U.S. penal system that is suppressed by Shoemaker, now warden of the Rock.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Still at odds with authority, Stroud nevertheless manages to help stop a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alcatraz" title="Battle of Alcatraz">prison rebellion in 1946</a> by throwing out the guns acquired by the convicts. He then assures the authorities that they can now re-enter the premises without fear of being shot. Although Stroud has been a thorn in his side for decades, Shoemaker acknowledges that he has never lied to him and takes him at his word.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although constantly denied <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole" title="Parole">parole</a>, Stroud is eventually transferred to another prison in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" title="Missouri">Missouri</a> after a petition campaign. During the move, he meets several reporters and displays a range of knowledge on more than just birds, such as the technical details of a passing jet aircraft. He even gets to meet the author of the book based on his life.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to those who knew him while he was in prison, the mild-mannered characterization of Stroud, as presented in Gaddis' book and the subsequent film, was largely fiction. Former inmate Glenn Williams went so far as to say that Stroud "was not a sweetheart; he was a vicious killer. I think Burt Lancaster owes us all an apology." He and another former convict, Jim Quillan, described the real Stroud as a "jerk", "a guy that liked chaos and turmoil and upheaval... Always at somebody else's expense." They regarded the film as a "comedy... an excellent comedy."</p>
