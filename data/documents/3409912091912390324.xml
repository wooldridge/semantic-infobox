      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soon after the nominations were announced, an outcry ensued from the press and the public regarding the worthiness of the nomination due to her minor role in the film, consisting of 14 seconds of screen time and 38 words of dialogue. One explanation for the nomination was that people were honoring Burstyn for her nominated but non-winning performance from the first <i>Harris</i> television film. A more popular accusation was that the nominating committee was either confused in their recollection, or merely "threw in" her name from sheer recognition, assuming a worthy performance without actually seeing it.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Television_Arts_%26_Sciences" title="Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences">Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences</a>, the administrator of the Primetime Emmy Awards, initially insisted that "based on the popular vote, this is a legitimate nomination". Meanwhile, HBO deflected the blame for submitting the nomination to the movie-production company. Burstyn's own reaction ranged from initial silence to comments such as, "I thought it was fabulous. My next ambition is to get nominated for seven seconds, and ultimately I want to be nominated for a picture in which I don't even appear," and "This doesn't have anything to do with me. I don't even want to know about this. You people work it out yourself."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ultimately, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Macdonald" title="Kelly Macdonald">Kelly Macdonald</a>, who starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_in_the_Cafe" title="The Girl in the Cafe">The Girl in the Cafe</a></i>, won the award. In March 2007, the Academy officially announced that eligibility for a Primetime Emmy Award in any long-form supporting-actor category required nominees to appear on-screen in at least ten percent of the project (nine minutes in a typical ninety-minute television film).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many critics still cite this incident to criticize the Emmy Award nomination process, claiming that name recognition has played an increasingly visible role over the years.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film charts three seasons in the lives of Sara Goldfarb (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Burstyn" title="Ellen Burstyn">Ellen Burstyn</a>), her son Harry (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Leto" title="Jared Leto">Jared Leto</a>), Harryâ€™s girlfriend Marion Silver (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Connelly" title="Jennifer Connelly">Jennifer Connelly</a>), and Harryâ€™s friend Tyrone C.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The story begins in summer. Sara Goldfarb, an elderly widow living alone in her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Beach" title="Brighton Beach">Brighton Beach</a> apartment, spends her time watching <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infomercial" title="Infomercial">infomercials</a> on television. After a phone call announces that she will be invited to be a participant on a game show, she becomes obsessed with matching her appearance to a photograph from Harry's graduation, her proudest moment. In order to fit into her old red dress, the favorite of her deceased husband, she begins taking a regimen of prescription <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-obesity_drug" title="Anti-obesity drug">weight-loss</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine" title="Amphetamine">amphetamine</a> pills throughout the day and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine" title="Benzodiazepine">sedative</a> at night. The pills alter her behavior, but she passionately insists that the chance to be on television has given her a reason to live. However, her invitation does not arrive over the fall, and she begins to up her dosage, causing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine_psychosis" title="Amphetamine psychosis">nightmarish hallucinations</a>, where she is the principal subject of the game show.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her son Harry is a heroin addict. Together with fellow addicts â€” his friend Tyrone and his girlfriend Marion â€” he enters the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade" title="Illegal drug trade">drug trade</a> in an attempt to realize their dreams. With the money they make over the summer, Harry and Marion hope to open a fashion store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone dreams of escaping the street and making his mother proud. However, at the beginning of fall, Tyrone is caught in the middle of a drug gang <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination" title="Assassination">assassination</a>, and Harry uses the majority of the money they've earned to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail" title="Bail">bail</a> him out of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jail" title="Jail">jail</a>. Meanwhile, because of the arrests and shootings of dealers, it becomes very hard to obtain any drugs, throwing Harry, Tyrone, and Marion into a state of deprivation. Growing more desperate, Harry convinces Marion to get money from her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> by having sex with him in exchange for money, causing a rift in the relationship. Marion begins <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution" title="Prostitution">prostituting</a> herself and Harry's arm is now severely infected from unsanitary injection techniques.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As in his previous film, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0_(film)" title="Î  (film)"><i>Ï€</i></a>, Aronofsky uses <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montage_(filming)" title="Montage (filming)">montages</a> of extremely short shots throughout the film (sometimes termed a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_montage" title="Hip hop montage">hip hop montage</a>). While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts, <i>Requiem</i> features more than 2,000.

Long tracking shots (including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorricam" title="Snorricam">Snorricam</a>) and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-lapse" title="Time-lapse">time-lapse</a> photography are also prominent stylistic devices.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to portray the shift from the objective, community-based narrative to the subjective, isolated state of the characters' perspectives, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme distance from the action and intercuts reality with a character's fantasy. Aronofsky aims to subjectivise emotion, and the effect of his stylistic choices is personalisation rather than alienation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film's distancing itself from empathy is furthered structurally by the use of intertitles (Summer, Fall, Winter), marking the temporal progress of addiction. The average scene length shortens as the movie progresses (beginning around 90 seconds to two minutes) until the movie's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_(narrative)" title="Climax (narrative)">climactic</a> scenes, which are cut together very rapidly (many changes per second) and are accompanied by a score which increases in intensity accordingly.
