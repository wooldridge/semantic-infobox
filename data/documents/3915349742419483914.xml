In 1934, Stuart and Newell divorced amicably and she married screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Sheekman" title="Arthur Sheekman">Arthur Sheekman</a>, one of the writers on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Scandals" title="Roman Scandals">Roman Scandals</a></i>.

Later Sheekman <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_writer" title="Ghost writer">ghost wrote</a> several of Marx's books; Marx called him "The Fastest Wit in The West". The Sheekmans' daughter, Sylvia, was born in 1935, and in 1939, both between commitments, Stuart convinced her husband they should travel around the world. When they reached France, they tried to volunteer for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Resistance" title="French Resistance">French Resistance</a>, but were turned down, so they caught the last ship sailing to New York.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">They decided to stay in New York and work in the theater. In the next few years, Sheekman wrote several plays (two with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Kaufman" title="George S. Kaufman">George S.

When Sheekman's third play flopped, they returned to Hollywood, and he was hired by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. Stuart took singing lessons and toured the country entertaining the troops in hospitals and selling war bonds. In 1946, she opened a small business, <b>DÃ©cor, Ltd</b>, where she sold lamps, tables, chests and other <i>objets d'art</i> of decoupage she created. Sheekman wrote 17 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay" title="Screenplay">screenplays</a> during the next 16 years. In 1954, with their daughter studying at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Berkeley" title="UC Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a>, Gloria and Arthur Sheekman joined friends who were living abroad, settling in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapallo" title="Rapallo">Rapallo</a> on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Riviera" title="Italian Riviera">Italian Riviera</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1975, after 29 years away from acting, with her husband in a nursing home suffering from Alzheimer's, Gloria got herself an agent and hoped for work. Over the next few years she appeared in small parts in television. Then in 1982 came an offer for what was to be one of her favorite scenes in all her films: playing a silver-haired dowager taking a solitary turn around a dance floor with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_O%27Toole" title="Peter O'Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Favorite_Year" title="My Favorite Year">My Favorite Year</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During this period, Gloria took up the Japanese art of bonsai, becoming the first Anglo member of the California Bonsai Society. And she began to travel again, going with friends or on her own to Europe, India, Africa, the Balkans. Arthur died in 1978. Five years later, Stuart became reacquainted with California printer Ward Ritchie (The Ward Ritchie Press), whom she had known during her college years. Both widowed, they fell in love. She was fascinated by his antique hand press and asked him to teach her how to run it. She bought her own hand press and established "Imprenta Glorias", and began creating <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artists%27_books" title="Artists' books">artists' books</a> (books hand-made, labor intensive, usually with a very limited run).</p>

Although the central roles and love story are fictitious, some characters are based on genuine historical figures. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Stuart" title="Gloria Stuart">Gloria Stuart</a> portrays the elderly Rose, who narrates the film in a modern-day <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_device" title="Framing device">framing device</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Zane" title="Billy Zane">Billy Zane</a> plays Cal Hockley, the overbearing fiancÃ© of the younger Rose. Cameron saw the love story as a way to engage the audience with the real-life tragedy.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Production on the film began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual <i>Titanic</i> wreck. The modern scenes were shot on board the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademik_Mstislav_Keldysh" title="Akademik Mstislav Keldysh">Akademik Mstislav Keldysh</a></i>, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the actual wreck. A reconstruction of the <i>Titanic</i> was built at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosarito_Beach" title="Rosarito Beach">Playas de Rosarito, Baja California</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model" title="Scale model">scale models</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> were also used to recreate the sinking.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was originally scheduled to open on July 2, 1997, however, post-production delays pushed back its release to December 19 instead. <i>Titanic</i> was an enormous critical and commercial success. It was nominated for fourteen <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>, eventually winning eleven, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Best Director</a>. It became <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" title="List of highest-grossing films">the highest-grossing film of all time</a>, with a worldwide gross of over $1.8 billion, and remained so for twelve years until Cameron's next directorial effort, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)" title="Avatar (2009 film)">Avatar</a></i>, surpassed it in 2010. <i>Titanic</i> also has been ranked as the sixth best epic film of all time in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_10_Top_10" title="AFI's 10 Top 10">AFI's 10 Top 10</a> by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a>.

	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team explore the wreck of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic" title="RMS Titanic">RMS <i>Titanic</i></a>, searching for a necklace called the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_the_Ocean" title="Heart of the Ocean">Heart of the Ocean</a>. They believe the necklace is in Caledon "Cal" Hockley's safe, which they recover. Instead of the diamond, they find a sketch of a nude woman wearing it, dated April 14, 1912, the night the <i>Titanic</i> hit the iceberg. Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, contacts Lovett, and tells him that she is the woman depicted. She and her granddaughter Elizabeth "Lizzy" Calvert visit Lovett and his team on his salvage ship. When asked if she knows the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose recalls her memories aboard the <i>Titanic</i>, revealing that she is Rose DeWitt Bukater, a passenger believed to have died in the sinking.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1912, the upper class Rose boards the ship in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, England with her fiancÃ© Caledon "Cal" Hockley, the son of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh" title="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> steel tycoon, and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Cal and Ruth stress the importance of Rose's engagement, because the marriage will solve the DeWitt Bukaters' financial problems. Distraught by her engagement to Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her, Rose considers suicide by jumping off the stern of the ship. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes and persuades her not to jump. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cal discovers Jack's drawing and a note in his safe along with the necklace, so he has the Heart of the Ocean slipped into Jack's coat pocket, thus framing him for stealing it. Jack is arrested, taken down to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master-at-arms" title="Master-at-arms">Master-at-arms</a>'s office and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his coat; but he later gives the coat, and thus unwittingly the necklace, to Rose. Rose runs away from Cal and her mother (who has boarded a lifeboat) to break Jack free with an axe.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jack and Rose struggle back to the deck where Cal and Jack persuade her to board a lifeboat, Cal claiming that he has made an arrangement that will allow both men to get off safely. After she boards, Cal doublecrosses Jack. Realizing that she cannot leave Jack, Rose reunites with him back on the <i>Titanic</i>. Infuriated, Cal takes a pistol and chases them into the flooding first-class dining saloon. When he runs out of ammunition he returns to the boat deck and boards a lifeboat by pretending to look after an abandoned child. As Jack and Rose return to the top deck, people everywhere are falling to their deaths and the lifeboats have all departed. The two take refuge on the stern as the ship sinks bow first until they are washed overboard. Jack helps Rose onto a nearby wall panel that will only support one personâ€™s weight. As he hangs onto the panel, he assures her that she will not die there; she will instead die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack eventually dies from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a rescue boat returns to the site of the sinking, Rose blows a whistle taken from a nearby dead officer, and is taken by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Carpathia" title="RMS Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> to New York, where she gives her name as Rose Dawson. Hidden, she avoids Cal for the last time on <i>Carpathia'</i>s deck as he searches for her.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her story complete, Rose goes alone to the stern of Lovett's ship. There she produces the Heart of the Ocean and drops it into the ocean. Later, while seemingly asleep in her bed, the photos of her days surround her, a visual chronicle that she lived the life she wanted with Jack. The young Rose then reunites with Jack at the Grand Staircase of the <i>Titanic</i>, cheered and congratulated by those who perished on the ship.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="Cast">Cast</span></h2>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio" title="Leonardo DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> as Jack Dawson: Cameron said he needed the cast to feel as though they were really on the <i>Titanic</i>, relive its liveliness, and "to take that energy and give it to Jack, he's an artist who is able to have his heart soar". After completing the script for <i>Titanic</i>, Cameron discovered that there had been a real "J. Dawson" who died aboard the <i>Titanic.</i> "J. Dawson" (Joseph Dawson) had been born in September 1888 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin, Ireland</a>. "His body was salvaged and buried at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairview_Cemetery,_Halifax,_Nova_Scotia" title="Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia">Fairview Lawn cemetery</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> with many other <i>Titanic</i> victims. Today, his grave stone (#227) is the most widely visited in the cemetery." Within the film, Jack is portrayed as a penniless <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> man who has toured various parts of the world, primarily Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS <i>Titanic</i> in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she attempts to throw herself off the stern of the ship. This enables him to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey" title="Matthew McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_O%27Donnell" title="Chris O'Donnell">Chris O'Donnell</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Crudup" title="Billy Crudup">Billy Crudup</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Dorff" title="Stephen Dorff">Stephen Dorff</a>, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> expressed an interest in [portraying] the character, though his superstar asking price was never taken seriously." DiCaprio, 22 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_Finn" title="Mali Finn">Mali Finn</a>. Initially, he did not want to portray the character, and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set. Cameron said, "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability, and told him, "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." Cameron rather envisioned the character as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart" title="James Stewart">James Stewart</a> type.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Winslet" title="Kate Winslet">Kate Winslet</a> as Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet "had the thing that you look for" and that there was "a quality in her face, in her eyes," that he "just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Caledon Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards the RMS <i>Titanic</i> with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, "She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that's not going to happen." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwyneth_Paltrow" title="Gwyneth Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Danes" title="Claire Danes">Claire Danes</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Anwar" title="Gabrielle Anwar">Gabrielle Anwar</a> had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, 22-year-old Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as "an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> type" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_test" title="Screen test">screen test</a> impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, "He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him." Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed "From Your Rose" and lobbied him by phone. "You don't understand!" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. "I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Zane" title="Billy Zane">Billy Zane</a> as Caledon Nathan "Cal" Hockley: Cal is Rose's 30-year-old fiancÃ©, and serves as the main antagonist of the film. He is arrogant and snobbish, and the heir to a steel fortune in Pittsburgh. He becomes increasingly embarrassed, jealous, and cruel about Rose's relationship with Jack. He later commits suicide after losing his fortune in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="Wall Street Crash of 1929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>. As with the role of Jack, the part was originally offered to Matthew McConaughey.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Fisher" title="Frances Fisher">Frances Fisher</a> as Ruth DeWitt Bukater: Rose's widowed mother, who arranges her daughter's engagement to Cal to maintain her family's high-class status. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important. She scorns Jack, even though he saved her daughter's life.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Stuart" title="Gloria Stuart">Gloria Stuart</a> as Rose Dawson Calvert: Cameron stated, "In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history." The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the "Heart of the Ocean" after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She tells the story of her time aboard the ship, mentioning Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role. Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, "My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema" title="Classical Hollywood cinema">Golden Age of the thirties and forties</a>." Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fay_Wray" title="Fay Wray">Fay Wray</a> was also considered for the role. "But [Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet's] spirit," stated Cameron. "I saw this <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joie_de_vivre" title="Joie de vivre">joie de vivre</a> in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person." Stuart believes her character died at the end of the film, while Cameron states in his DVD commentary that he prefers to leave the viewer to form their own interpretation of the ending. Stuart died on September 26, 2010, at age 100, approximately the same age elder Rose was in the film.</li>

	<li>Lewis Abernathy as Lewis Bodine: Lovett's friend, who expresses doubt about whether the elderly Rose is telling the truth. He demonstrates to Rose, with little regard for sensitivity, how the <i>Titanic</i> sank with a computer simulation.

She is friendly to Jack and lends him a tuxedo (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. Although Brown was a real person, Cameron chose not to portray her real-life actions. Molly Brown was dubbed "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" by historians because she, with the support of other women, commandeered <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_Lifeboat_No._6" title="Titanic Lifeboat No. 6">Lifeboat 6</a> from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hichens_(RMS_Titanic)" title="Robert Hichens (RMS Titanic)">Quartermaster Hichens</a>.

After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a "mathematical certainty" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. It is unknown how the real Andrews died.</li>

He retreats into the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when water bursts through the windows whilst clinging to the ship's wheel. It is often disputed whether he died this way or later froze to death, as he was reported seen near the overturned Collapsible B.</li>

During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the 'Boston Dawsons', a question Jack neatly deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chippewa_Falls,_Wisconsin" title="Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin">Chippewa Falls</a> Dawsons.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron" title="James Cameron">James Cameron</a> was fascinated by shipwrecks, particularly the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic" title="RMS Titanic">RMS <i>Titanic</i></a>, and wrote a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_treatment" title="Film treatment">treatment</a> for the film. He said he made <i>Titanic</i> "because [he] wanted to dive to the shipwreck, not because [he] particularly wanted to make the movie". He said that the <i>Titanic</i> was "the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest" title="Mount Everest">Mount Everest</a> of shipwrecks" and he, as a diver, wanted to tell the story correctly. "When I learned some other guys had dived to the <i>Titanic</i> to make an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX" title="IMAX">IMAX</a> movie, I said, 'Iâ€™ll make a Hollywood movie to pay for an expedition and do the same thing.' I loved that first taste, and I wanted more," stated Cameron. "<i>Titanic</i> was about 'fuck you' money. It came along at a point in my life when I said, 'I can make movies until Iâ€™m 80, but I canâ€™t do expedition stuff when Iâ€™m 80.'" Cameron's father had been an engineer. "I had studied to be an engineer and had a mental restlessness to live the life I had turned my back on when I switched from the sciences to the arts in college," said Cameron.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He described the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> as "like a great novel that really happened". Yet, over time, he felt that the event had become a mere <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality_play" title="Morality play">morality tale</a>, and described making the film as putting the audience in an experience of living history. Cameron described a love story as the most engaging part of a story. As the likable Jack and Rose had their love blossom and eventually destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss. Cameron said, "All my films are love stories, but in <i>Titanic</i> I finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history." Lastly, Cameron created a modern framing of the romance with an elderly Rose, making the history palpable and poignant. The treasure hunter Brock Lovett is meant to represent those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy. Cameron wanted to honor the people who died during the sinking, and he spent six months fully researching what happened, creating a timeline of all the <i>Titanic'</i>s crew and passengers. At the end of the film, it was not made clear if the elderly Rose was in a conscious dream, or had died in her sleep. Cameron stated that he did that on purpose in order to leave it for the viewer to interpret the scene individually.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cameron met with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a>, and pitched the film as "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a> on the <i>Titanic</i>". There was a tense pause and Cameron said, "Also, fellas, it's a period piece, it's going to cost $150,000,000 and there's not going to be a sequel." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Chernin" title="Peter Chernin">Peter Chernin</a> was among the cadre of studio executives. Cameron said, "They were like, 'Oooooohkaaaaaay â€“ a three-hour romantic epic? Sure, that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator" title="The Terminator">Terminator</a></i> in that? Any <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrier_Jump_Jet" title="Harrier Jump Jet">Harrier jets</a>, shoot-outs, or car chases?' I said, 'No, no, no. It's not like that.'" Fox was dubious about the idea's commercial prospects, but hoping for a long term relationship with Cameron, they gave him a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-light" title="Green-light">greenlight</a>. Cameron convinced them to make a film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the wreck itself, and organized several dives to the wreck of the <i>Titanic</i> over a period of two years. "My pitch on that had to be a little more detailed," said Cameron. "So I said, â€˜Look, weâ€™ve got to do this whole opening where theyâ€™re exploring the <i>Titanic</i> and they find the diamond, so weâ€™re going to have all these shots of the ship." Cameron stated, "Now we can either do them with elaborate models and motion control shots and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics" title="Computer graphics">CG</a> and all that, which will cost X amount of money â€“ or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The crew shot in the Atlantic Ocean twelve times in 1995, shooting during eleven of those occasions, and actually spent more time with the ship than its passengers. At that depth, the water pressure is 6,000 pounds per square inch. "One small flaw in the vessel's superstructure would mean instant death for all on board." In addition to all of the dives being high-risk, various conditions prevented Cameron from getting the high quality footage that he wanted. After filming the underwater shots, he began writing the film's screenplay.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cameron said that diving to the wreck made him and his crew want "to live up to that level of reality" from that point on. "But there was another level of reaction coming away from the real wreck, which was that it wasn't just a story, it wasn't just a drama," he said. "It was an event that happened to real people who really died. Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it." Cameron stated, "You think, 'There probably aren't going to be many filmmakers who go to <i>Titanic.</i> There may never be another one â€“ maybe a documentarian." Due to this, he felt that it "sort of [became] a great mantle of responsibility to convey the emotional message of it â€“ to do that part of it right, too".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modern day scenes of the expedition were shot on the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademik_Mstislav_Keldysh" title="Akademik Mstislav Keldysh">Akademik Mstislav Keldysh</a></i> in July 1996. Principal photography for <i>Titanic</i> began in September 1996 at the newly-built Fox Baja Studios. The scenes on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poop_deck" title="Poop deck">poop deck</a> were built on a hinge which could rise from zero to ninety degrees in a few seconds as the ship's stern rose during the sinking. For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber. By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron chose to build his RMS <i>Titanic</i> on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard" title="Port and starboard">starboard</a> side as a study of weather data showed prevailing north-to-south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, as it was docked on its <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard" title="Port and starboard">port</a> side. Any writing on props and costumes had to be reversed, and if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cameron sketched the portrait of nude Rose, while in the film it is depicted as having been drawn by Jack. Cameron said repression is the backdrop of the scene. "You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason," he said. The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them," Cameron stated. "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot." He said he and his crew "were just trying to find things to shoot" because the big set was not yet ready. "It wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot." After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, other moments on the set did not work out as smoothly. The filming of <i>Titanic</i> was an arduous experience for all involved. The making of the film "cemented Cameronâ€™s formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood'. He became known as an uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist" and a "300- decibel screamer, a modern-day <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bligh" title="William Bligh">Captain Bligh</a> with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into peopleâ€™s faces on a 162ft crane". Winslet stated, "God damn it! He would yell at some poor crew member. Thatâ€™s exactly what I didnâ€™t want!" Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming, and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in. "There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldnâ€™t believe," she said. Her co-star, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Paxton" title="Bill Paxton">Bill Paxton</a>, was familiar with Cameron's work ethics, having previously already acted in a number of Cameron-related films. "There were a lot of disgruntled people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds," he said. The film's crew felt that Cameron had an evil alter ego, and nicknamed him "Mij" (Jim spelt backwards). In response to the criticism, Cameron stated, "Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During shooting on the <i>Akademik Mstislav Keldysh</i>, an angry crew member put the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen" title="Hallucinogen">hallucinogen</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine" title="Phencyclidine">PCP</a> into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night, which sent more than 50 people to the hospital. "There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics," said actor Lewis Abernathy. Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. "One eye was completely red, like the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(character)" title="Terminator (character)">Terminator</a> eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like heâ€™d been sniffing glue since he was four." The person behind the poisoning was never caught.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160. Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. After dealing with fears of drowning, chipping an elbow bone, and getting the flu, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned "a lot of money". Several others left and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The costs of filming <i>Titanic</i> eventually began to mount, and finally reached US$200 million. Fox executives panicked, and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less money even though long epics are more likely to help directors win <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Oscars</a>. Cameron refused, telling Fox, "You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!" he said. The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture; they felt that profits would be unlikely. Cameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. "...the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day" title="Terminator 2: Judgment Day">T2</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Lies" title="True Lies">True Lies</a>.</i> Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. <i>Titanic</i> also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more," said Cameron. "As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harland_and_Wolff" title="Harland and Wolff">Harland and Wolff</a>, the RMS <i>Titanic'</i>s builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lamont" title="Peter Lamont">Peter Lamont</a>'s team looked for artifacts from the era, however, the newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch. Fox acquired 40Â acres (16 ha) of waterfront south of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosarito_Beach" title="Rosarito Beach">Playas de Rosarito</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A seventeen-million-gallon tank was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstructure" title="Superstructure">superstructure</a> and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was just steel plating. Within was a fifty-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. Towering above was a 162Â feet (49 m) tall tower crane on 600Â feet (180 m) of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_(rail_transport)" title="Track (rail transport)">rail track</a>, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cameron paid meticulous attention to detail. "I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the shipâ€™s few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life," he said. "And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what Iâ€™d written and comment on it, and I adjusted it." Cameron said when they started the production, they had "a very clear picture" of what happened on the ship that night. "I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with <i>Titanic stuff</i>, because I wanted it to be right, especially if we were going to dive to the ship," he said. "That set the bar higher in a way â€“ it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if youâ€™d gone back in a time machine and shot it."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A full time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast on the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912. Despite this, several critics picked up on the anachronisms in Cameron's script, not least involving the two main stars. The sets representing the interior rooms of the <i>Titanic</i> were reproduced exactly as originally built, using photographs and plans from the <i>Titanic's</i> builders. "The liner's first class staircase, which figures prominently in the script was constructed out of real wood and actually destroyed in the filming of the sinking." The rooms, the carpeting, design and colors, individual pieces of furniture, decorations, chairs, wall paneling, cutlery and crockery with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Star_Line" title="White Star Line">White Star Line</a> crest on each piece, completed ceilings, and costumes were among the designs true to the originals. Cameron additionally hired two <i>Titanic</i> historians, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Lynch" title="Don Lynch">Don Lynch</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Marschall" title="Ken Marschall">Ken Marschall</a>, to authenticate the historical detail in the film. After shooting the sinking scenes, the ship was then dismantled and sold for scrap metal to cover budgetary costs.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was one "crucial historical fact" Cameron chose to omit â€“ the ship that was close to the <i>Titanic</i>, but had turned off its radio for the night and did not hear their <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS" title="SOS">SOS</a> calls. "Yes, the [<i>SS</i>] <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Californian" title="SS Californian">Californian</a>.</i> That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film," stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. "The story of the <i>Californian</i> was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set," said Cameron. "But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If <i>Titanic</i> is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cameron wanted to push back the boundary of special effects with his film, and enlisted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Domain" title="Digital Domain">Digital Domain</a> to continue the developments in digital technology which the director pioneered while working on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abyss" title="The Abyss">The Abyss</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day" title="Terminator 2: Judgment Day">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></i>. Many previous films about the RMS <i>Titanic</i> shot water in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_motion" title="Slow motion">slow motion</a>, which did not look wholly convincing. He encouraged them to shoot their 45-foot (14 m) long <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model" title="Scale model">miniature</a> of the ship as if "we're making a commercial for the White Star Line". Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture" title="Motion capture">motion capture</a> stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot (20 m) long model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water. For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Jeremiah_O%27Brien" title="SS Jeremiah O'Brien">SS <i>Jeremiah O'Brien</i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s</a> engines were composited with miniature support frames and actors shot against a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key" title="Chroma key">greenscreen</a>. In order to save money, the first class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An enclosed 5,000,000Â USÂ gallons (19,000,000 l) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000Â USÂ gallons (340,000 l) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot (227 m) long exterior of the RMS <i>Titanic</i> had its first half lowered into the tank, but being the heaviest part of the ship meant it acted as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_absorber" title="Shock absorber">shock absorber</a> against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remotely_operated_vehicle" title="Remotely operated vehicle">ROV</a> traversing the wreck in the present. The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000Â USÂ gallons (1,300,000 l) tank, where the frozen corpses were created by applying a powder on actors that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks, as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous <i>Titanic</i> films for depicting the final plunge of the liner as sliding gracefully underwater. He "wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was". When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized "by using computer generated people for the dangerous falls".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett's story. In the original version of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat, and fear she is going to jump. Rose then reveals that she had the "Heart of the Ocean" diamond all along, but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal's money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep, whereupon the film ends in the same way as the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the <i>Titanic'</i>s sinking.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The version used for the first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_screening" title="Test screening">test screening</a> featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy which takes place after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon, but the test audiences disliked it. The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and featured Cal (falsely) offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_the_Ocean" title="Heart of the Ocean">Heart of the Ocean</a>" if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first class dining room. Just as they are about to escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the "theft" of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The soundtrack album for <i>Titanic</i> was composed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Horner" title="James Horner">James Horner</a>. For the vocals heard throughout the film, subsequently described by Earle Hitchner of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> as "evocative", Horner chose Norwegian singer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sissel_Kyrkjeb%C3%B8" title="Sissel KyrkjebÃ¸">Sissel KyrkjebÃ¸</a>, better known as "Sissel". Horner knew Sissel from her album <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innerst_i_sjelen" title="Innerst i sjelen">Innerst I Sjelen</a></i>, and he particularly liked how she sang "<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eg_veit_i_himmerik_ei_borg" title="Eg veit i himmerik ei borg">Eg veit i himmerik ei borg</a></i>" ("I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle"). He had tried twenty-five or thirty singers before he finally chose Sissel as the voice to create specific moods within the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Horner additionally wrote the song "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Heart_Will_Go_On" title="My Heart Will Go On">My Heart Will Go On</a>" in secret with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jennings" title="Will Jennings">Will Jennings</a> because Cameron did not want any songs with singing in the film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion" title="Celine Dion">CÃ©line Dion</a> agreed to record a demo with the persuasion of her husband <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Ang%C3%A9lil" title="RenÃ© AngÃ©lil">RenÃ© AngÃ©lil</a>. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared its approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for "going commercial at the end of the movie". Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and "saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion".</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="Release">Release</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> financed <i>Titanic</i>, and expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997. The film was to be released on this date "in order to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better". In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film for summer would not be possible. With production delays, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997. "This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster." However, a preview screening in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis" title="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> on July 14 "generated positive reviews" and "[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth" title="Word of mouth">word of mouth</a> about the [film]". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film premiered on November 1, 1997, at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_International_Film_Festival" title="Tokyo International Film Festival">Tokyo International Film Festival</a>, where reaction was described as "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tepid" title="wiktionary:tepid">tepid</a>" by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>. However, positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where "the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of the eighteenth James Bond film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_Never_Dies" title="Tomorrow Never Dies">Tomorrow Never Dies</a></i>. By New Year's Day, <i>Titanic</i> had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. Its biggest single day took place on Saturday, February 14 (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day" title="Valentine's Day">Valentine's Day</a>), 1998, making $13,048,711, more than six weeks after it debuted in North America. It stayed at number one for fifteen consecutive weeks in the United States and Canada, which remains a record for any film. By March 1998, it was the first film to earn more than $1 billion worldwide. The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost ten months, before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998 with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Office_Mojo" title="Box Office Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a> estimates that after adjusting for ticket price <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation" title="Inflation">inflation</a>, <i>Titanic</i> would be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_in_Canada_and_the_United_States" title="List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States">the sixth highest-grossing film</a> of all time in the United States and Canada. The film made double its domestic amount overseas, generating an international gross of $1,248,025,607 and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide. It became the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" title="List of highest-grossing films">highest-grossing film in history</a>, and remained so for twelve years, until <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)" title="Avatar (2009 film)">Avatar</a></i>, also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before its release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially due to it being the most expensive film ever made at the time. When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, "it was with massive forebodings" since the "people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs â€“ because of this great <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross_(metaphor)" title="Albatross (metaphor)">albatross</a> of a picture on which, finally, two studios had had to combine to share the great load of its making". Cameron also thought he was "headed for disaster" at one point during filming. "We labored the last six months on <i>Titanic</i> in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100m. It was a certainty," he stated. As the film neared release, "particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance". A film critic for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> wrote that "Cameronâ€™s overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project" and that the film was "a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the film became a success, with an unprecedented box office performance, it was credited as "the love story [that] stole the world's hearts". "The first batch of people to see it [were] gob smacked by the sheer scale and intimacy of the production. They emerged from the cinema, tear stained and emotionally flabbergasted." The film was playing on 3,200 screens a full ten weeks after it opened, and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million a week for ten weeks, and after fourteen weeks into its run, it was still bringing in more than $1m a week. Although teenage girls, as well as young women in general, who would see the film several times and subsequently caused "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio#Superstardom_and_.22Leo-Mania.22" title="Leonardo DiCaprio">Leo-Mania</a>", were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record, other reports have simply attributed the film's success to "[p]ositive word of mouth and repeat viewership" due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects. Its impact on men has also been especially credited. Now considered one of the films that "make men cry", <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a>'s Ian Hodder stated that men admire Jack's sense of adventure, stowing away on a steamship bound for America. "We cheer as he courts a girl who was out of his league. We admire how he suggests nude modeling as an excuse to get naked. So when Jack plunges to his death, an uncontrollable flood of tears sinks our composure," he said. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com said that, as a fourteen-year-old male, he had wanted to see <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers_(film)" title="Starship Troopers (film)">Starship Troopers</a></i> instead, but was overruled by an uncle and friends. "Little did I know that I would be seeing a film that would become the biggest, most successful motion picture event of all time," he stated. "I was also blissfully unaware that it would turn out to be so much more than 'some epic love story'".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film's catch phrase "I'm the king of the world!" became one of the film industry's more popular quotes. According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_University" title="Kansas State University">Kansas State University</a>, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotes in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. "People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh", he said. He found that all of the participants in his study had used film quotes in conversation at one point or another. "They overwhelmingly cited comedies, followed distantly by dramas and action adventure flicks." As for horror films, musicals and children's films, they were hardly ever cited.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. "When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it," he said. "They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's how <i>Titanic</i> worked." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Awareness_Network" title="Media Awareness Network">Media Awareness Network</a> stated, "The normal repeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for <i>Titanic</i> was over 20%." The box office receipts "were even more impressive" when factoring in "the film's 3 hour and 14 minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings". In response to this, "[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For twelve years after its release, various films were cited as contenders for surpassing <i>Titanic'</i>s box office gross; however, all failed to do so. Cameron's most recent film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)" title="Avatar (2009 film)">Avatar</a></i>, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross, and did so in 2010. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)#Commercial_analysis" title="Avatar (2009 film)">Various explanations</a> for why the film was able to successfully challenge <i>Titanic</i> were given. For one, "Two-thirds of <i>Titanic's</i> haul was earned overseas, and <i>Avatar</i> [tracked] similarly... <i>Avatar</i> opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them" and the markets "such as Russia, where <i>Titanic</i> saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" with "more screens and moviegoers" than ever before. Brandon Gray, president of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Office_Mojo" title="Box Office Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a>, said that while <i>Avatar</i> may beat <i>Titanic's</i> revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass <i>Titanic</i> in attendance. "Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." In December 2009, Cameron had stated, "I don't think it's realistic to try to topple <i>Titanic</i> off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. <i>Titanic</i> just struck some kind of chord." In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once <i>Avatar's</i> performance was easier to predict. "It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time," he said.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics. Review aggregator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reports the film as holding an overall 83% approval rating based on 98 reviews, with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean" title="Weighted mean">rating average</a> of 7.4 out of 10. The site's general consensus is that the film is "[a] mostly unqualified triumph for Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama". At <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean" title="Weighted mean">weighted mean</a> rating out of 0â€“100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 74 based on 34 reviews, classified as a generally favorably reviewed film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When regarding the film's overall design, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> stated, "It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding...Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well." He credited the "technical difficulties" with being "so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" and "found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga". It was named as his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Movies_(U.S._TV_series)" title="At the Movies (U.S. TV series)">Siskel &amp; Ebert</a></i>, the film received "two thumbs up" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as "a glorious Hollywood epic, well-crafted and well worth the wait" and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Siskel" title="Gene Siskel">Gene Siskel</a> found Leonardo DiCaprio "captivating". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Berardinelli" title="James Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> stated, "Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, <i>Titanic</i> is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch <i>Titanic</i>, you experience it." It was named his second best film of 1997. Almar Haflidason of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> wrote that "[t]he sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy" and that "when you consider that it tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron". Joseph McBride of <i>Boxoffice Magazine</i> concluded, "To describe <i>Titanic</i> as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The romantic and emotionally-charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of <i>Urban Cinefile</i> said, "You will walk out of <i>Titanic</i> not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Gleiberman" title="Owen Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> described the film as, "A lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Maslin" title="Janet Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> commented that "Cameron's magnificent <i>Titanic</i> is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone With the Wind</a></i>." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Corliss" title="Richard Corliss">Richard Corliss</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine, on the other hand, wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some reviewers felt that the story and dialogue were weak, while the visuals were spectacular. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Turan" title="Kenneth Turan">Kenneth Turan</a>'s review in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, "What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.", and later claimed that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total. Barbara Shulgasser of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Francisco_Examiner" title="The San Francisco Examiner">The San Francisco Examiner</a></i> gave <i>Titanic</i> one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, "The number of times in this unbelievably badly-written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say." Also, filmmaker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman" title="Robert Altman">Robert Altman</a> called it "the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Titanic</i> suffered backlash in addition to its success. In 2003, the film topped a poll of "Best Film Endings", and yet it also topped a poll by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Film_programme" title="The Film programme">The Film programme</a></i> as "the worst movie of all time". The British film magazine <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(magazine)" title="Empire (magazine)">Empire</a></i> reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readersâ€™ tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. "What really irks me...," he said, "are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it." Willcock stated, "I obviously donâ€™t have anything against those who dislike <i>Titanic</i>, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular. "<i>Titanic</i> is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off," he stated. "They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion." Cameron emphasized people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were "celebrating their own essential humanity" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally "incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless â€“ and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype" title="Archetype">archetypes</a>. He did not see it as pandering. "Turan mistakes archetype for cliche," he said. "I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Empire</i> eventually reinstated its original five star rating of the film, commenting, "It should be no surprise then that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron's <i>Titanic</i> at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever. Them's the facts."</p>

So far, it has ranked on the following six lists:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Titanic</i> was released worldwide in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widescreen" title="Widescreen">widescreen</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_and_scan" title="Pan and scan">pan and scan</a> formats on VHS and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laserdisc" title="Laserdisc">laserdisc</a> on September 1, 1998. The VHS was also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and a color booklet. A DVD version was released on July 31, 1999 in a widescreen-only (non-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphic_format" title="Anamorphic format">anamorphic</a>) single-disc edition with no special features other than a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(film)" title="Trailer (film)">theatrical trailer</a>. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies. At the time, fewer than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. "When we released the original <i>Titanic</i> DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now," said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A special edition disc set was released on October 25, 2005 and included a three-disc <i>Special Collector's Edition</i>. The release was only available in the United States and Canada, and contained a newly restored transfer of the film, as well as various special features.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An international two and four-disc set followed on November 7, 2005. The two-disc edition was marketed as the <i>Special Edition</i>, and featured the first two discs of the three-disc set, only <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL" title="PAL">PAL</a>-enabled. A four-disc edition, marketed as the <i>Deluxe Collector's Edition</i>, was also released on November 7, 2005.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also, available only in the United Kingdom, a limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title <i>Deluxe Limited Edition</i>, was released with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentary <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_of_the_Abyss" title="Ghosts of the Abyss">Ghosts of the Abyss</a></i>, which was distributed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures" title="Walt Disney Pictures">Walt Disney Pictures</a>. Unlike the individual release of <i>Ghosts of the Abyss</i>, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As regards to television broadcasts, the film airs occasionally across the United States on networks such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(TV_channel)" title="TNT (TV channel)">TNT</a>. To permit the scene where Jack draws the nude portrait of Rose to be shown on network and specialty cable channels, in addition to minor cuts, the sheer, see-through blouse worn by Winslet was digitally painted black. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Classic_Movies" title="Turner Classic Movies">Turner Classic Movies</a> also began to show the film, specifically during the days leading up to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_Academy_Awards" title="82nd Academy Awards">82nd Academy Awards</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 2009 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International" title="San Diego Comic-Con International">San Diego Comic-Con</a>, Cameron announced that <i>Titanic</i> is in the process of being converted into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_film" title="3-D film">3-D</a> and re-released in theaters at some point in 2011. "We've tested it, seen a couple of minutes converted. It looks spectacular. But it really requires the filmmaker to be involved to make sure that the Stereo Space decisions are made correctly," he said. In a March 2010 interview with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i>, Cameron stated, "I'm guessing six months to a year to do it right. We're targeting spring of 2012 for the release (of a 3-D version of <i>Titanic</i>), which is the 100th anniversary of the sailing of the ship."</p>
