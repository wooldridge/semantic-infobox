	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wood began acting in movies at the age of four and became a successful child actor in such films as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_34th_Street" title="Miracle on 34th Street">Miracle on 34th Street</a></i> (1947).

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her career continued successfully with films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_%26_Carol_%26_Ted_%26_Alice" title="Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice">Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice</a></i> (1969). After this she took a break from acting and had two children, appearing in only two theatrical films during the 1970s. She was married to actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wagner" title="Robert Wagner">Robert Wagner</a> twice, and to producer Richard Gregson. She had one daughter by each: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natasha_Gregson" title="Natasha Gregson">Natasha Gregson</a> and Courtney Wagner. Her younger sister, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Wood" title="Lana Wood">Lana Wood</a>, is also an actress. Wood starred in several television productions, including a remake of the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Here_to_Eternity_(TV_series)" title="From Here to Eternity (TV series)">From Here to Eternity</a></i> (1979) for which she won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_%E2%80%93_Television_Series_Drama" title="Golden Globe Award for Best Actress â€“ Television Series Drama">Golden Globe Award</a>.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wood was born <b>Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko</b> in San Francisco, to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians" title="Russians">Russian</a> immigrant parents Maria Stepanova (nÃ©e Zudilova) and Nikolai Zacharenko. Her father was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok" title="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> and the family fled <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> during the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_(1917)" title="Russian Revolution (1917)">Revolution</a>. He was sent to live with relatives in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, but later moved to San Francisco, where he worked as a day laborer and carpenter. Natalie's mother originally came from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>, but grew up in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">Chinese</a> city of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin" title="Harbin">Harbin</a>. She described her family by weaving mysterious tales of being either gypsies or landowning aristocrats. In her youth her mother dreamed of becoming an actress or ballet dancer.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biographer Warren Harris writes that under the family's "needy circumstances," her mother may have transferred those ambitions to her middle daughter, Natalie. Her mother would take Natalie to the movies as often as she could: "Natasha's only professional training was watching Hollywood child stars from her mother's lap," notes Harris. Natalie Wood would later recall this early period:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shortly after her birth in San Francisco, her family moved to nearby <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_County" title="Sonoma County">Sonoma County</a>, and lived in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa,_California" title="Santa Rosa, California">Santa Rosa, California</a>, where Wood was noticed during a film shoot in downtown Santa Rosa. Her mother soon moved the family to Los Angeles and pursued a career for her daughter. Wood had one younger sister, Svetlana Zacharenko (better known as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Wood" title="Lana Wood">Lana Wood</a>), who also became an actress and later, notably, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_girl" title="Bond girl">Bond girl</a>. She and Lana have an older half sister, Olga Viriapaeff. Though Natalie had been born "Natalia Zacharenko," her father later changed the family name to "Gurdin" and Natalie was often known as "Natasha," the diminutive of Natalia. Hollywood would later change her name to "Natalie Wood," a name she really never cared for.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wood made her film debut a few weeks before turning five, in a fifteen-second scene in the film <i>Happy Land</i> (1943). Despite the brief part, she attracted the notice of the director, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Pichel" title="Irving Pichel">Irving Pichel</a>, who remained in touch with her family for two years until another role came up. The director phoned Natasha's mother and asked her to bring Natasha down to Los Angeles for a screen test. Her mother became so excited at the possibilities, she overreacted and "packed the whole family off to Los Angeles to live," writes Harris. Her husband opposed the whole idea, but his wife's "overpowering ambition to make Natasha a star" took priority.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wood, then seven years old, got the part and played a German orphan opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudette_Colbert" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_Is_Forever" title="Tomorrow Is Forever">Tomorrow Is Forever</a></i>. Welles later said that Wood was a born professional, "so good, she was terrifying". After doing another film directed by Pichel, her mother signed her to a role with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> studio for her first major role, the Christmas classic <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_34th_Street" title="Miracle on 34th Street">Miracle on 34th Street</a></i> (1947), which made her one of the top child stars in Hollywood. Within a few months after the film's release she was so popular that Macy's invited her to appear in the store's annual Thanksgiving Day parade.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She would eventually appear in over 20 films as a child, appearing opposite such stars as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Tierney" title="Gene Tierney">Gene Tierney</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart" title="James Stewart">James Stewart</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_O%27Hara" title="Maureen O'Hara">Maureen O'Hara</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Davis" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Crosby" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>. As a child actor, her formal education took place on the studio lots wherever she was acting. California law required that until age 18, actors had to spend at least three hours per day in the classroom, notes Harris. "She was a straight A student," and one of the few child actors to excel at arithmetic. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_L._Mankiewicz" title="Joseph L. Mankiewicz">Joseph L. Mankiewicz</a>, who directed her in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_and_Mrs._Muir" title="The Ghost and Mrs. Muir">The Ghost and Mrs. Muir</a></i> (1947), said that "In all my years in the business, I never met a smarter moppet." Wood remembers that period in her life:</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wood successfully made the transition from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_actor" title="Child actor">child star</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenue_(stock_character)" title="Ingenue (stock character)">ingenue</a> at age 16 when she co-starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean" title="James Dean">James Dean</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal_Mineo" title="Sal Mineo">Sal Mineo</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Without_a_Cause" title="Rebel Without a Cause">Rebel Without a Cause</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Ray" title="Nicholas Ray">Nicholas Ray</a>'s film about teenage rebellion. She was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress</a>.

She graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1956.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Signed to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Brothers" title="Warner Brothers">Warner Brothers</a>, Wood was kept busy during the remainder of the decade in many 'girlfriend' roles that she found unsatisfying. The studio cast her in two films opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_Hunter" title="Tab Hunter">Tab Hunter</a>, hoping to turn the duo into a box office draw that never materialized.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although many of Wood's films were commercially profitable, her acting was criticized at times. In 1966 she won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Lampoon" title="Harvard Lampoon">Harvard Lampoon</a> Worst Actress of the Year Award. She was the first performer in the award's history to accept it in person and the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Crimson" title="Harvard Crimson">Harvard Crimson</a></i> wrote she was "quite a good sport." Conversely, director Sydney Pollack said "When she was right for the part, there was no one better. She was a damn good actress." Other notable films she starred in were <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Daisy_Clover" title="Inside Daisy Clover">Inside Daisy Clover</a></i> (1965) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Property_Is_Condemned" title="This Property Is Condemned">This Property Is Condemned</a></i> (1966), both of which co-starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a> and brought subsequent Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. In both films, which were set during the Great Depression, Wood played small-town teens with big dreams. After the release of the films, Wood suffered an emotional breakdown and sought professional therapy. During this time, she turned down the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Dunaway" title="Faye Dunaway">Faye Dunaway</a> role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde" title="Bonnie and Clyde">Bonnie and Clyde</a></i> because she didn't want to be separated from her analyst.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After three years away from acting, Wood played a swinger in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_%26_Carol_%26_Ted_%26_Alice" title="Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice">Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice</a></i> (1969), a comedy about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_liberation" title="Sexual liberation">sexual liberation</a>. The film was one of the top ten box office hits of the year, and Wood received ten percent of the film's profits. After becoming pregnant with her first child, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natasha_Gregson" title="Natasha Gregson">Natasha Gregson</a>, in 1970, she went into semi-retirement and only acted in four more theatrical films during the remainder of her life. She appeared as herself in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Candidate_(1972_film)" title="The Candidate (1972 film)">The Candidate</a></i> (1972), reuniting her for a third time with Robert Redford. She also reunited on the screen with Robert Wagner in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affair" title="The Affair">The Affair</a></i> (1973), a television adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_on_a_Hot_Tin_Roof" title="Cat on a Hot Tin Roof">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a></i> (1976) and made cameo appearances on his shows <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch" title="Switch">Switch</a></i> in 1978 as "Bubble Bath Girl" and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_to_Hart" title="Hart to Hart">Hart to Hart</a></i> in 1979 as "Movie Star".

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the time of her death, Wood was filming the sci-fi film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorm_(1983_film)" title="Brainstorm (1983 film)">Brainstorm</a></i> (1983), co-starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Walken" title="Christopher Walken">Christopher Walken</a> and directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Trumbull" title="Douglas Trumbull">Douglas Trumbull</a>.

Due to her untimely death, both of the latter projects were canceled and the ending of <i>Brainstorm</i> had to be re-written. A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-in" title="Stand-in">stand-in</a> and sound-a-likes were used to replace Wood for some of her critical scenes. The film was released posthumously on September 30, 1983, and was dedicated to her in the closing credits.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She appeared in 56 films for cinema and television. Following her death, <i>Time</i> magazine noted that although critical praise for Wood had been sparse throughout her career, "she always had work."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natalie Wood's two marriages to actor Robert Wagner were highly publicized. Wood said she had a crush on Wagner since she was a child and on her 18th birthday she went on a studio-arranged date with the 26-year old actor. They married a year later on December 28, 1957, which met with great protest from Wood's mother. In an article in February 2009, Wagner recalled their early romance:</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On May 30, 1969, Wood married British producer Richard Gregson. The couple dated for two and a half years prior to their marriage, while Gregson waited for his divorce to be finalized. They had a daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natasha_Gregson" title="Natasha Gregson">Natasha Gregson</a> (born September 29, 1970). They separated in August 1971 after Wood overheard an inappropriate telephone conversation between her secretary and Gregson. The split also marked a brief estrangement between Wood and her family, when mother Maria and sister Lana told her to reconcile with Gregson for the sake of her newborn child. She filed for divorce, and it was finalized in April 1972.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In September and October 1981, Wood and Wagner stayed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina" title="Raleigh, North Carolina">Raleigh, North Carolina</a>, while Wood did location work for the science-fiction film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorm_(1983_film)" title="Brainstorm (1983 film)">Brainstorm</a></i>. Wood then spent most of November in California shooting interior scenes with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Walken" title="Christopher Walken">Christopher Walken</a> and other cast members on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM">MGM</a> lot in Culver City.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The day after Thanksgiving, Wood, Wagner and Walken went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catalina_Island,_California" title="Santa Catalina Island, California">Catalina Island</a> for the weekend and on the night of November 28, the Wagners' yacht (<i>Splendour</i>) was anchored in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Catalina_Island" title="Isthmus of Catalina Island">Isthmus Cove</a>. Also on board was the boat's skipper, Dennis Davern, who had worked for the couple for many years. The official theory is that Wood either tried to leave the yacht or to secure a dinghy from banging against the hull when she accidentally slipped and fell overboard. When her body was found, she was wearing a down jacket, nightgown, and socks. A woman on a nearby yacht said she heard calls for help at around midnight. The cries lasted for about 15 minutes and were answered by someone else who said, "Take it easy. We'll be over to get you". "It was laid back", the witness recalled. "There was no urgency or immediacy in their shouts". There was much partying going on in the area, though, and while it has never been proven that the woman calling for help was, indeed, Natalie Wood, no other person ever has been identified or come forward as having called out for help on that night. An investigation by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County" title="Los Angeles County">Los Angeles County</a> coroner <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Noguchi" title="Thomas Noguchi">Thomas Noguchi</a> resulted in an official verdict of accidental drowning. Noguchi concluded Wood had drank "seven or eight" glasses of wine and was intoxicated when she died. Noguchi also wrote that he found Wood's fingernail scratches on the side of the rubber dinghy indicating she was trying to get in. Wood was 43 at the time of her death and is buried in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_Village_Memorial_Park_Cemetery" title="Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery">Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery</a>. On March 11, 2010 Wood's sister Lana Wood decided to re-open the case of her death.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the funeral, at least a thousand spectators, along with scores of photographers and reporters from around the world, were spread out behind the cemetery walls.
