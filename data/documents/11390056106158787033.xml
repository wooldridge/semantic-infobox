      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lane was born in New York City. Her mother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Farrington" title="Colleen Farrington">Colleen Farrington</a>, was a nightclub singer and <i>Playboy</i> centerfold (Miss October 1957), who was also known as "Colleen Price." Her father, Burton Eugene Lane, was a Manhattan drama coach who ran an acting workshop with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassavetes" title="John Cassavetes">John Cassavetes</a>, worked as a cab driver, and later taught humanities at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York" title="City College of New York">City College</a>. When Lane was 13 months old, her parents split up. Her mother went to Mexico and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_divorce" title="Mexican divorce">obtained a divorce</a> while retaining custody of her daughter until the child was six. Her father got custody of her after Farrington moved to Georgia. Lane and her father lived in a number of residential hotels in New York City and she would ride with him in his taxi.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Lane was fifteen years old, she declared her independence from her father and ran away to Los Angeles for a week with actor and friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Atkins" title="Christopher Atkins">Christopher Atkins</a>. Lane later remarked, "It was reckless behavior that comes from having too much independence too young." She returned to New York and moved in with a friend's family, paying them rent. In 1981, she enrolled in high school after taking correspondence courses. However, Lane's mother kidnapped her and took the teenager back to Georgia. Lane and her father challenged her mother in court and six weeks later she was back in New York. Lane did not speak to her mother for the subsequent three years, but they have since reconciled.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lane's maternal grandmother, Eleanor Scott, was a thrice-married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostal" title="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preacher" title="Preacher">preacher</a> of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Church_(denomination)" title="Apostolic Church (denomination)">Apostolic</a> denomination, and Lane was influenced by the theatrical quality of her grandmother's sermons. Lane began acting professionally at the age of six at the La MaMa Experimental Theater Club in New York, where she appeared in an production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea_(play)" title="Medea (play)">Medea</a></i>. At 12 she had a role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Papp" title="Joseph Papp">Joseph Papp</a>'s production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cherry_Orchard" title="The Cherry Orchard">The Cherry Orchard</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep" title="Meryl Streep">Meryl Streep</a>. Also at this time, Lane was enrolled in an accelerated program at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_College_High_School" title="Hunter College High School">Hunter College High School</a> and was put on notice when her grades suffered from her busy schedule. At 13 years old, she turned down a role in <i>Runaways</i> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> to make her feature film debut opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Romance" title="A Little Romance">A Little Romance</a></i>. Lane won high praise from Olivier who declared her 'The New <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Kelly" title="Grace Kelly">Grace Kelly</a>'. At the same time Lane was featured on the cover of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_magazine" title="Time magazine">Time</a></i>, which declared her one of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>'s "Whiz Kids."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the early 1980s, Lane made a successful transition from child actor to adult roles. Her breakout performances came with back-to-back adaptations of young adult novels by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.E._Hinton" title="S.E. Hinton">S.E. Hinton</a>, adapted and directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(film)" title="The Outsiders (film)">The Outsiders</a></i> in 1982 and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_Fish" title="Rumble Fish">Rumble Fish</a></i> in 1983. Both films also featured memorable performances from a number of young male actors who would go on to become leading men in the next decade (as well as members of the so-called ""<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack_(actors)" title="Brat Pack (actors)">Brat Pack</a>""), including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe" title="Rob Lowe">Rob Lowe</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Thomas_Howell" title="C. Thomas Howell">C.

Lane's distinction among these heavily male casts advanced her career while affiliating her with this young generation of male actors. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> proclaimed her, "the undisputed female lead of Hollywood's new rat pack."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the two films that could have catapulted her to star status, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Fire" title="Streets of Fire">Streets of Fire</a></i> (she turned down <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splash_(film)" title="Splash (film)">Splash</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risky_Business" title="Risky Business">Risky Business</a></i> for this film) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cotton_Club_(film)" title="The Cotton Club (film)">The Cotton Club</a></i>, were both commercial and critical failures, and her career languished as a result. After <i>The Cotton Club</i>, Lane dropped out of the movie business and lived with her mother in Georgia. According to the actress, "I hadn't been close to my mom for a long time, so we had a lot of homework to do. We had to repair our relationship because I wanted my mother back".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lane returned to acting to appear in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Town_(1987_film)" title="The Big Town (1987 film)">The Big Town</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Beware" title="Lady Beware">Lady Beware</a></i>, but it was not until 1989's popular and critically acclaimed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_mini-series" title="TV mini-series">TV mini-series</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonesome_Dove" title="Lonesome Dove">Lonesome Dove</a></i> that Lane made another big impression on a sizable audience, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for her role. She was given positive reviews for her performance in the independent film <i>My New Gun</i>, which was well received at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. She went on to appear as actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulette_Goddard" title="Paulette Goddard">Paulette Goddard</a> in Sir <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Attenborough" title="Richard Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>'s big-budget biopic of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Chaplin" title="Charles Chaplin">Charles Chaplin</a>, 1992's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplin_(film)" title="Chaplin (film)">Chaplin</a></i>. Lane won further praise for her role in 1999's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Walk_on_the_Moon" title="A Walk on the Moon">A Walk on the Moon</a></i>, opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viggo_Mortensen" title="Viggo Mortensen">Viggo Mortensen</a>. One reviewer wrote, "Lane, after years in post-teenaged-career limbo, is meltingly effective." The film's director, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Goldwyn" title="Tony Goldwyn">Tony Goldwyn</a>, described Lane as having "...this potentially volcanic sexuality that is in no way self-conscious or opportunistic." Lane earned an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Spirit_Award" title="Independent Spirit Award">Independent Spirit Award</a> nomination for Best Female Lead. At this time, she was interested in making a film about actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Seberg" title="Jean Seberg">Jean Seberg</a> in which she would play Seberg.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2002, Lane starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfaithful_(film)" title="Unfaithful (film)">Unfaithful</a></i>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_film" title="Drama film">drama film</a> directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Lyne" title="Adrian Lyne">Adrian Lyne</a> and adapted from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_France" title="Cinema of France">French</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Femme_infid%C3%A8le" title="La Femme infidÃ¨le">The Unfaithful Wife</a></i>. Lane played a housewife who indulges in an adulterous fling with a mysterious book dealer. The film featured several sex scenes. Lyne's repeated takes for these scenes were very demanding for the actors involved, especially for Lane, who had to be emotionally and physically fit for the duration. <i>Unfaithful</i> received mostly mixed to negative reviews, though Lane earned widespread praise for her performance. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Gleiberman" title="Owen Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> stated that "Lane, in the most urgent performance of her career, is a revelation. The play of lust, romance, degradation, and guilt on her face is the movie's real story". She followed that film up with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Tuscan_Sun_(film)" title="Under the Tuscan Sun (film)">Under the Tuscan Sun</a></i>, based on the best-selling book by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Mayes" title="Frances Mayes">Frances Mayes</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2008, Lane reunited with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gere" title="Richard Gere">Richard Gere</a> for the movie <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nights_in_Rodanthe_(film)" title="Nights in Rodanthe (film)"><i>Nights in Rodanthe</i></a>. It is the third movie Gere and Lane filmed together. The film was based on the novel of the same title by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Sparks_(author)" title="Nicholas Sparks (author)">Nicholas Sparks</a>. Lane also starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumper_(film)" title="Jumper (film)">Jumper</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untraceable" title="Untraceable">Untraceable</a></i> in the same year. She then appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killshot_(film)" title="Killshot (film)">Killshot</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Rourke" title="Mickey Rourke">Mickey Rourke</a>, which was given a limited theatrical release before being released on DVD in 2009.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2008, Lane expressed frustration with being typecast and stated that she was "gunning for something that's not so sympathetic. I need to be a bitch, and I need to be in a comedy. I've decided. No more Miss Nice Guy". The actress has even contemplated quitting acting and spending more time with her family if she is unable to get these kinds of roles. She said in an interview, "I can't do anything official. My agents won't let me. Between you and me, I don't have anything else coming out".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, Lane starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretariat_(film)" title="Secretariat (film)">Secretariat</a></i>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney" title="Disney">Disney</a> film about the relationship between the 1973 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing" title="United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing">Triple Crown</a>-winning <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretariat_(horse)" title="Secretariat (horse)">racehorse</a> and his owner, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Chenery" title="Penny Chenery">Penny Chenery</a>, whom Lane portrayed.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Constance (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Lane" title="Diane Lane">Lane</a>) and Edward Sumner (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gere" title="Richard Gere">Gere</a>) are a couple who live in suburban New York City. Their marriage is solid and loving but lacking passion. One day, Connie journeys into the city and finds herself caught in a windstorm. As she chases after taxis, she bumps into a stranger (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Martinez" title="Olivier Martinez">Martinez</a>). They both fall and Connie scrapes her knees. The stranger offers to let her use his apartment to clean herself up. At that moment, an empty cab goes by, but Connie accepts the offer instead of heading back to the train station. The stranger introduces himself as Paul Martel, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">Frenchman</a> who buys and sells used books. Connie becomes uncomfortable and decides to leave when Paul makes small advances toward her. He lets her go but gives her a book of Persian poetry, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam" title="Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam">Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</a></i>, as a gift.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later that night, Connie mentions the incident to her husband but does not elaborate. The next morning, after Edward and their son Charlie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Per_Sullivan" title="Erik Per Sullivan">Sullivan</a>) leave, she picks up the poetry book. Paul's business card falls out. She then takes the train into the city again and calls him from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Station" title="Grand Central Station">Grand Central Station</a>. He invites her over for coffee. He makes her coffee and shows her how to read a book in braille. But when Paul begins caressing her hands, Connie decides to leave. Later that night, Connie seems distracted, obviously thinking about Paul. The next morning she shows up at his door. When Connie enters Paul's apartment, he asks her to dance. She obliges and they begin flirting with each other. As the record they are dancing to begins to skip she decides that what they are doing is a mistake. Paul tells her, "There is no such thing as a mistake. There is what you do and what you don't do." Connie replies, "I can't do this," and starts to leave the building. But when she has to come back into the apartment for her coat, Paul grabs her and kisses her and then they engage in intercourse.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Connie and Paul begin a passionate sexual <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affair" title="Affair">affair</a>. Edward soon suspects something when his wife increases the frequency of her visits to Manhattan. She uses her work on a charity event as an excuse, but Edward finds holes in her stories when he speaks with mutual friends. She shows less interest in him without explicitly showcasing infidelity, <i>i.e.,</i> removing her wedding ring to wash the dishes. Eventually, one of Edward's business partners catches a glimpse of Connie and Paul fawning over each other in a cafe and tells Edward, who hires a detective (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Chianese" title="Dominic Chianese">Chianese</a>) to follow Connie. Edward left the town for the day and Connie and Paul were enjoying that day in the lonely movie hall and also Connie forgets to pick up his son from the school. The detective returns with pictures of Connie and Paul that devastate Edward.</p>

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to actor Richard Gere, an early draft of the screenplay that he read several years ago presented the Sumners as suffering from a dysfunctional sexual relationship that gave Constance partial justification for having an affair. According to the actor and to director Adrian Lyne, the studio wanted to change the storyline so that the Sumners had a bad marriage with no sex, thereby creating greater sympathy for Constance. Both men were opposed to this change; Lyne in particular felt that the studio's suggestions would have robbed the film of any drama: "I wanted two people who were perfectly happy. I loved the idea of the totally arbitrary nature of infidelity." The Sumners' relationship was rewritten as a good marriage, with her affair the result of a chance meeting.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During pre-production, the producers received a video taped audition from Olivier Martinez and he ended up with the part of Paul. His character was not originally envisioned as being French but became so when Martinez was cast. Lyne said, "I think it helps one understand how Connie might have leapt into this affair--he's very beguiling, doing even ordinary things." Once cast in the role, Martinez, with Lyne's approval, changed some of his dialogue and the approach to the scene in which he first seduces Diane Lane's character while she is looking at a book in braille. According to Martinez, "The story that was invented before was much more sensual, erotic and clear." Lyne cast Lane in the role of Constance after seeing her in the film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Walk_on_the_Moon" title="A Walk on the Moon">A Walk on the Moon</a></i>. He felt that the actress, "breathes a certain sexuality. But she's sympathetic, and I think so many sexy women tend to be tough and hard at the same time." Lyne also wanted Gere and Lane to gain weight in order to reflect the comfort of a middle-age couple. In particular, he wanted Gere to gain 30 pounds and would leave donuts in the actor's trailer every morning. (It is unclear if either actor actually gained weight for the role.)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lyne asked director of photography Peter Biziou, with whom he made <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9%C2%BD_Weeks" title="9Â½ Weeks">9Â½ Weeks</a>,</i> to shoot <i>Unfaithful</i>. After reading the script, Biziou felt that the story lent itself to the classic 1.85:1 aspect ratio because, "so often has two characters working together in the frame." During pre-production, Biziou, Lyne and production designer Brian Morris used a collection of still photographs as style references. These included photos from fashion magazines and shots by prominent photographers.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initially, the story was set against snowy exteriors, but this idea was rejected early on. Principal photography started on March 22, 2001 and wrapped on June 1, 2001 with Lyne shooting in continuity whenever possible. The film was primarily shot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>. During the windstorm sequence where Connie first meets Paul, it rained and Lyne used the overcast weather conditions for the street scenes. The director also preferred shooting practical interiors on location so that the actors could "feel an intimate sense of belonging", Biziou recalls. The cinematographer also used natural light as much as possible.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At times, Lyne's style of directing took its toll on the cast and crew. In a scene taking place in an office, the director pumped it full of smoke, an effect that "makes the colors less contrasty, more muted". According to Biziou, "the texture it gives helps differentiate and separate various density levels of darkness farther back in frame". The smoke was piped in for 18 to 20 hours a day and Richard Gere remembers, "Our throats were being blown out. We had a special doctor who was there almost all the time who was shooting people up with antibiotics for bronchial infections". Lane even went so far as to get an oxygen bottle in order to survive the rigorous schedule.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Throughout the film, there are many explicit sex scenes, including a spontaneous tryst in a restaurant bathroom and a rather passionate exchange in an apartment building hallway. Lyne's repeated takes for these scenes were very demanding for the actors involved, especially for Lane who had to be emotionally and physically fit for the scenes. To prepare for the initial love scene between Paul and Constance, Lyne had Lane and Martinez watch clips from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Attraction" title="Fatal Attraction">Fatal Attraction</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Easy_Pieces" title="Five Easy Pieces">Five Easy Pieces</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Tango_in_Paris" title="Last Tango in Paris">Last Tango in Paris</a></i>. She and Martinez would also talk over the scenes in his trailer beforehand but once on set felt uncomfortable until several takes in. She said, "My comfort level with it just had to catch up quickly if I wanted to be the actress to play it." Martinez, however, was not comfortable with nudity. The actress said that Lyne would often shoot a whole magazine of film, "so one take was as long as five takes. By the end, you're physically and emotionally shattered." She had not met Martinez before filming and they did not get to know each other well during the shoot, mirroring the relationship between their characters. A full four weeks of the schedule was dedicated to the scenes in Paul's loft, which was located on the third floor of a six-story building located on Greene Street. Biziou often used two cameras for the film's intimate scenes thereby reducing the number of takes that had to be shot to spare the actors more discomfort.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lyne shot five different endings to <i>Unfaithful</i> based on his experiences with <i>Fatal Attraction,</i> whose initial ending was rejected by the test audience. According to Lyne, there was some debate with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century-Fox" title="20th Century-Fox">20th Century-Fox</a> who wanted to "make the marriage gray, the sex bad. I fought that. I tried to explore the guilt, the jealousyâ€”that's what I'm interested in". The studio did not like the film's "enigmatic" ending, which they felt failed to punish crimes committed by the characters, and imposed a "particularly jarring 'Hollywood' final line," angering Gere. Following negative reactions from test audiences, the studio reinstated the original ending; a few weeks before the film was to open in theaters, Lyne asked Gere and Lane to return to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> for re-shoots of the ending. Lyne claimed that the new ending was more ambiguous than the original and was the one that screenwriter Alvin Sargent originally wrote. Additionally, the director felt that the new ending would "it would be more interesting and provoke more discussion".</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Unfaithful</i> opened on May 10, 2002 in 2,617 theaters and grossed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">USD</a> $14 million with an average of $5,374 per screen. It made $52 million in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and a total of $119 million worldwide, well above its $50 million budget.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film received largely mixed reviews, though Diane Lane earned widespread praise for her performance. It currently has a rating of 47% on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (48% for their "Cream of the Crop" designation). <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN" title="CNN">CNN</a> film critic Paul Tatara wrote, "The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times, and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Gleiberman" title="Owen Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> awarded the film an "A-" grade and praised Lane for delivering, "the most urgent performance of her career, is a revelation. The play of lust, romance, degradation, and guilt on her face is the movie's real story." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i> wrote, "Instead of pumping up the plot with recycled manufactured thrills, it's content to contemplate two reasonably sane adults who get themselves into an almost insoluble dilemma." In his review for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i>, Kenneth Turan wrote, "The only performer who manages to get inside her character is Lane. Whether it's her initial half-distrustful tentativeness, her later sensual abandon or her never-ending ambivalence, Lane's Constance seems to be actually living the role in a way no one else matches, a way we can all connect to."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stephen Holden, in his review for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, praised the "taut, economical screenplay" that "digs into its characters' marrow (and into the perfectly selected details of domestic life) without wasting a word. That screenplay helps to ground a film whose visual imagination hovers somewhere between soap opera and a portentous pop surrealism." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and Mike Clark wrote, "Diane Lane also reaches a new career plateau with her best performance since 1979's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Romance" title="A Little Romance">A Little Romance</a></i>." In his review for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i>, Stephen Hunter wrote, "In the end, <i>Unfaithful</i> leaves you dispirited and grumpy: All that money spent, all that talent wasted, all that time gone forever, and for what? It's an ill movie that bloweth no man to good." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ansen" title="David Ansen">David Ansen</a>, in his review for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i>, wrote, "<i>Unfaithful</i> shows what a powerful, sexy, smart filmmaker Lyne can be. It's a shame he substitutes the mechanics of suspense for the real suspense of what goes on between a man and a woman, a husband and a wife." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sarris" title="Andrew Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a>, in his review for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Observer" title="The New York Observer">The New York Observer</a></i>, wrote, "Ultimately <i>Unfaithful</i> is escapism in its purest form, and I am willing to experience it on that level, even though with all the unalloyed joy on display, there's almost no humor," and concluded that it was "one of the very few mainstream movies currently directed exclusively to grown-ups."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studio took out trade ads and mailed copies of the movie to Academy voters by the end of November. The campaign's theme consisted of what the studio called the film's "iconic scene": Constance recounting her first tryst with Paul as she takes a train home. According to Tom Rothman, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, "That scene captured the power of her performance. It's what everyone talked about after they saw her." Four days before the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Critics" title="New York Film Critics">New York Film Critics</a> Circle's vote, Lane was given a career tribute by the Film Society of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Center" title="Lincoln Center">Lincoln Center</a>. A day before that, Lyne held a dinner for the actress at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Seasons_Hotel" title="Four Seasons Hotel">Four Seasons Hotel</a>. Critics and award voters were invited to both. She went on to win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Society_of_Film_Critics" title="National Society of Film Critics">National Society of Film Critics</a>, the New York Film Critics Circle awards and was nominated for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe</a> and an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> ranked <i>Unfaithful</i> the 27th on their 50 Sexiest Movies Ever list.</p>
