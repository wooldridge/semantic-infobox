	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite being a critical failure, it won four <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>. It was the highest grossing film of 1963, earning US $26 million, yet made a loss due to its cost of $44 million, the only film ever to be the highest grossing film of the year yet to run at a loss.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film is infamous for nearly bankrupting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a>. Originally budgeted at $2 million, it was made at a cost of $44 million â€” the equivalent of $307.5 million in 2009 dollars (see the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films" title="List of most expensive films">list of most expensive films</a> to produce), making the movie the third-most costly ever produced worldwide and the second most expensive in the United States after <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_At_World%27s_End" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</a></i>, which had a budget of US$300,000,000 (accounting for inflation in each case). This was partly due to the fact that the film's elaborate, complicated sets, costumes and props had to be constructed twice, once during a botched shoot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> and once more when the production relocated to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming began in London in 1960. Mankiewicz was brought into the production after the departure of the first director, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouben_Mamoulian" title="Rouben Mamoulian">Rouben Mamoulian</a>. (In the early stages of the project, before the casting of Elizabeth Taylor, Mamoulian is said to have favored <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American" title="African-American">African-American</a> actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Dandridge" title="Dorothy Dandridge">Dorothy Dandridge</a> for the lead role.) Mankiewicz inherited a film which was already $5 million over budget and had no usable footage to show for it. This was in part because the actors originally hired to play Julius Caesar (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Finch" title="Peter Finch">Peter Finch</a>) and Marc Antony (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Boyd" title="Stephen Boyd">Stephen Boyd</a>) left due to other commitments. Mankiewicz was later fired during the editing phase, only to be rehired when no one else could piece the film together.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elizabeth Taylor was awarded a record-setting contract of $1 million. This amount eventually swelled to $7 million due to the delays of the production, equivalent to over $47 million today. Taylor became very ill during the early filming and was rushed to an emergency room where a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy" title="Tracheotomy">tracheotomy</a> had to be performed to save her life. The resulting scar can be seen in some shots. All of this resulted in the film being shut down. The production was moved to Rome after six months as the English weather proved detrimental to her recovery, as well as being responsible for the constant deterioration of the costly sets and exotic plants required for the production (the English sets were utilised for the spoof <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_On_Cleo" title="Carry On Cleo">Carry On Cleo</a></i>). During filming, Taylor met <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a> and the two began a very public affair, which made headlines worldwide. Moral outrage over the scandal brought bad publicity to an already troubled production.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cut of the film which Mankiewicz screened for the studio was six hours long. This was cut to four hours for its initial premiere, but the studio demanded (over the objections of Mankiewicz) that the film be cut once more, this time to just barely over three hours to allow theaters to increase the number of showings per day. As a result, certain details are left out of the film, such as Rufio's death. Mankiewicz unsuccessfully attempted to convince the studio to split the film in two in order to preserve the original cut. The film has been released to home video formats in its 243-minute premiere version, and efforts are under way to locate the missing footage (some of which has been recovered).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The arduous process and enormous cost of completing <i>Cleopatra</i> resulted in the end of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_and_sandal" title="Sword and sandal">sword and sandal</a> epic.</p>

Pompey flees to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, hoping to enlist the support of the young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh" title="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XIII_Theos_Philopator" title="Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator">Ptolemy XIII</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_O%27Sullivan" title="Richard O'Sullivan">Richard O'Sullivan</a>) and his sister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra" title="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Taylor" title="Elizabeth Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caesar pursues. He meets the teenage Ptolemy and the boy's advisers, who seem to do most of the thinking for him. As a gesture of 'goodwill', the Egyptians present Caesar with Pompey's head, but Caesar is not pleased; it is a sorry end for a worthy foe. As Caesar settles in at the palace, Apollodorus (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Danova" title="Cesare Danova">Cesare Danova</a>), disguised as a rug peddler, brings a gift from Cleopatra. When a suspicious Caesar unrolls the rug, he finds Cleopatra herself concealed within. He is intrigued.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Days later, she warns Caesar that her brother has surrounded the palace with his soldiers and that he is vastly outnumbered. Caesar is unconcerned. He orders the Egyptian fleet burned so he can gain control of the harbor. The fire spreads to the city, burning many buildings, including the famous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria" title="Library of Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>. Cleopatra angrily confronts Caesar, but he refuses to pull troops away from the fight with Ptolemy's forces to deal with the fire. In the middle of their spat, Caesar begins kissing her.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Romans hold, and the armies of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_I_of_the_Bosporus" title="Mithridates I of the Bosporus">Mithridates</a> arrive on Egyptian soil. The following day, Caesar passes judgment. He sentences Ptolemy's lord chamberlain to death for arranging an assassination attempt on Cleopatra, and rules that Ptolemy and his tutor be sent to join Ptolemy's now greatly outnumbered troops, a sentence of death as the Egyptian army faces off against Mithridates.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cleopatra is crowned Queen of Egypt. She dreams of ruling the world with Caesar. When their son <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion" title="Caesarion">Caesarion</a> is born, Caesar accepts him publicly, which becomes the talk of Rome and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate" title="Roman Senate">Senate</a>.</p>

Two years pass before the two see each other again. After he is made <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_dictator" title="Roman dictator">dictator</a> for life, Caesar sends for Cleopatra. She arrives in Rome in a lavish procession and wins the adulation of the Roman people. The Senate grows increasingly discontented amid rumors that Caesar wishes to be made king, which is anathema to the Romans.</p>

However, the rivalry between Octavian and Antony is becoming apparent.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While planning a campaign against <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthia" title="Parthia">Parthia</a> in the east, Antony realizes he needs money and supplies, and cannot get enough from anywhere but Egypt. After refusing several times to leave Egypt, Cleopatra gives in and meets him in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(city)" title="Tarsus (city)">Tarsus</a>. Antony becomes drunk during a lavish feast. Cleopatra sneaks away, leaving a slave dressed as her, but Antony discovers the trick and confronts the queen. They soon become lovers.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Octavian uses their affair in his smear campaign against Antony. When Antony returns to Rome to address the situation brewing there, Octavian traps him into a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_of_state" title="Marriage of state">marriage of state</a> to Octavian's sister, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_Minor" title="Octavia Minor">Octavia</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Marsh" title="Jean Marsh">Jean Marsh</a>). Cleopatra flies into a rage when she learns the news.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A year or so later, when Antony next sees Cleopatra, he is forced to humble himself publicly. She demands a third of the empire in return for her aid. Antony acquiesces and divorces Octavia. Octavian clamors for war against Antony and his "Egyptian whore". The Senate is unmoved by his demands until Octavian reveals that Antony has left a will stating that he is to be buried in Egypt; shocked and insulted, the Senators who had previously stood by Antony abandon their hero and vote for war. Octavian murders the Egyptian ambassador, Cleopatra's tutor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosigenes_of_Alexandria" title="Sosigenes of Alexandria">Sosigenes</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_Cronyn" title="Hume Cronyn">Hume Cronyn</a>), on the Senate steps.</p>

Seeing Antony's ship burning, Cleopatra assumes he is dead and orders the Egyptian forces home. Antony follows, leaving his fleet leaderless and soon defeated. After a while, Cleopatra manages to convince Antony to retake command of his troops and fight Octavian's advancing army. However, Antony's soldiers have lost faith in him and abandon him during the night; Rufio (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Landau" title="Martin Landau">Martin Landau</a>), the last man loyal to Antony, is killed. Antony tries to goad Octavian into single combat, but is finally forced to flee into the city.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Antony returns to the palace, Apollodorus, not believing that Antony is worthy of his queen, convinces him that she is dead, whereupon Antony falls on his own sword. Apollodorus then takes Antony to Cleopatra, and he dies in her arms. Octavian captures the city without a battle and Cleopatra is brought before him. He wants to return to Rome in triumph, with her as his prisoner.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the end of principal photography was finally in sight, it became clear that in order for <i>Cleopatra</i> merely to break even it would have to be one of the two or three most successful films made up to that time. <i>Cleopatra</i> went on to a $48 million take in North America, making it the highest-grossing film of the year. Twentieth Century Fox's share of the receipts ($26 million) returned just over half of the film's total cost. Worldwide box-office receipts and television sales eventually recouped most of the film's cost. As a result of the continual pouring of money into the long-delayed production, the studio was forced to undertake drastic retrenchments. Meanwhile, Twentieth Century Fox's fortunes were restored with the release of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_(film)" title="The Sound of Music (film)">The Sound of Music</a></i> in 1965, which became one of the most popular films in cinema history.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A contributing factor to the film's problems was the hype, both internal and public, which surrounded <i>Cleopatra</i>. Billed as the next great cinematic masterpiece, Fox continued to invest more and more money into the project, confident that audiences would adore it. Yet as production continued to falter, the top studio executives took much more direct and personal control of the project, complicating it even further. Films that were to be funded from the profits of <i>Cleopatra</i> were delayed or canceled, tying the fate of the studio to this one film. The extensive marketing campaign reflected how optimisticâ€”or desperateâ€”Fox was about the movie as they printed posters with new release dates every few months as production ground on.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the film was finally released, the problems that had plagued production were finally fully evident. Historians criticized the inaccurate depictions of Octavian as a weak-stomached yet power-mad teenager and disliked the rewrite of how and why Julius Caesar was killed. Stage actors cited the disjointed script and directing styles as the root of the movie's problems (Mankiewicz had been able to write less than half the shooting script when filming commenced, so he ended up writing much of the script on the fly as filming went on). Critics found the acting to be over the top in many scenes, scoffing that it took a special class of film maker to get such great actors to act so badly. And as talented as the actors may have been, the extreme length and breadth of <i>Cleopatra</i> made it difficult for audiences to grasp the general plot and theme; the two halves tending to focus more on Julius Caesar and Marc Antony, respectively, than on Cleopatra herself.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Part of the fallout of chaotic production was a shifting away from the traditional "studio-system" prevalent in Hollywood up to that time. While studios would continue to finance major films, financial burdens would increasingly be shifted onto independent production companies as a way to buffer the "parent" studio from a loss. Indeed the financial situation at Fox was so dire in the wake of <i>Cleopatra</i> that the studio executives were forced to sell most of the studio's large backlot in Los Angeles to developers. This area today forms the core of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_City" title="Century City">Century City</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie earned Elizabeth Taylor a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Record" title="Guinness World Record">Guinness World Record</a> title, "Most costume changes in a film", with 65 costume changes.
