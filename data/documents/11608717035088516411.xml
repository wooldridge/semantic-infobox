      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Dustin Lee Hoffman</b> (born August 8, 1937) is an American actor with a career in film, television, and theatre since 1960. He has been known for his versatile portrayals of antiheroes and vulnerable types of characters.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He first drew critical praise for the 1966 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-Broadway" title="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eh%3F" title="Eh?">Eh?</a></i> for which he won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_World_Award" title="Theatre World Award">Theatre World Award</a> and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_Desk_Award" title="Drama Desk Award">Drama Desk Award</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hoffman was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>, the second and youngest son of Lillian (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Gold) and Harry Hoffman. His father worked as a prop supervisor/set decorator at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> before becoming a furniture salesman. Hoffman was named after stage and silent screen actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Farnum" title="Dustin Farnum">Dustin Farnum</a>. His older brother, Ronald, is a lawyer and economist. Hoffman is from a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew" title="Jew">Jewish</a> family of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians" title="Ukrainians">Ukrainian</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanians" title="Romanians">Romanian</a> descent, but his upbringing was not religious or observant. He graduated from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_High_School" title="Los Angeles High School">Los Angeles High School</a> in 1955 and enrolled at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica_College" title="Santa Monica College">Santa Monica College</a> with the intention of studying medicine, leaving after a year to join the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena_Playhouse" title="Pasadena Playhouse">Pasadena Playhouse</a>.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hoffman began his acting career at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena_Playhouse" title="Pasadena Playhouse">Pasadena Playhouse</a> alongside future Academy Award nominee <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Hackman" title="Gene Hackman">Gene Hackman</a>. After two years at the playhouse, Hackman headed for New York City with Hoffman soon following. Having considerable difficulty getting roles in part due to his unconventional countenance for an actor of that time, he took a series of odd jobs, including working as a restaurant coat checker, working in the typing department of the city <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Pages" title="Yellow Pages">Yellow Pages</a> directory, and stringing Hawaiian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lei_(Hawaii)" title="Lei (Hawaii)">leis</a>. During this time period he would get an occasional bit television role but left acting briefly to teach in order to support himself. He also found work directing off-Broadway and community theater productions and as a professional fragrance tester for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_House" title="Maxwell House">Maxwell House</a>. Hoffman would also occasionally do <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_commercials" title="Television commercials">television commercials</a>; an often-replayed segment on programs that explore actors' early work is a clip showing Hoffman touting the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_3" title="Volkswagen Type 3">Volkswagen Fastback</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1960, Hoffman landed a role in an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-Broadway" title="Off-Broadway">off-Broadway</a> production and followed with a walk-on role in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> production in 1961. Hoffman then studied at the famed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actors_Studio" title="Actors Studio">Actors Studio</a> and became a dedicated <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting" title="Method acting">method actor</a>. Sidney Pink, a producer and 3D movie pioneer, discovered him in one of his off-Broadway roles and cast him in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madigan%27s_Millions" title="Madigan's Millions">Madigan's Millions</a>. His first critical success was in <i>Eh?</i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Livings" title="Henry Livings">Henry Livings</a> which had its US premiere off-Broadway at the Circle in the Square Downtown on October 16, 1966.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through the early and mid-1960s, Hoffman made appearances in television shows and movies, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_City_(TV_series)" title="Naked City (TV series)">Naked City</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(TV_series)" title="The Defenders (TV series)">The Defenders</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallmark_Hall_of_Fame" title="Hallmark Hall of Fame">Hallmark Hall of Fame</a></i>. Hoffman made his theatrical film debut in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tiger_Makes_Out" title="The Tiger Makes Out">The Tiger Makes Out</a></i> in 1967, alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Wallach" title="Eli Wallach">Eli Wallach</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1967, immediately after wrapping up principal filming on <i>The Tiger Makes Out</i>, Hoffman flew from New York City to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo,_North_Dakota" title="Fargo, North Dakota">Fargo, North Dakota</a>, where he directed a production of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saroyan" title="William Saroyan">William Saroyan</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_of_Your_Life" title="The Time of Your Life">The Time of Your Life</a></i> for the Emma Herbst Community Theatre. The $1,000 he received for the eight-week contract was all he had to hold him over until the funds from the movie materialized.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1966, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Nichols" title="Mike Nichols">Mike Nichols</a> cast Hoffman in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Graduate" title="The Graduate">The Graduate</a></i>. The film began production in March 1967. Hoffman received an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> nomination for his performance and became a major star although he was initially mocked, often with an implied <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-semitism" title="Anti-semitism">anti-semitism</a>, for his unconventional looks. After the success of this film, another Hoffman film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madigan%27s_Millions" title="Madigan's Millions">Madigan's Millions</a></i>, shot before <i>The Graduate</i>, was released on the tail of the actor's newfound success. It was considered a failure at the box office.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In December 1968 Hoffman returned to Broadway to appear in the title role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Schisgal" title="Murray Schisgal">Murray Schisgal</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sebastian" title="John Sebastian">John Sebastian</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Shine" title="Jimmy Shine">Jimmy Shine</a></i>. For his performance in the production Hoffman won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_Desk_Award" title="Drama Desk Award">Drama Desk Award</a> for Outstanding Performance. Just a few weeks after leaving the production, Hoffman's next major film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Cowboy" title="Midnight Cowboy">Midnight Cowboy</a></i> premiered in theatres across the United States on 25 May 1969. For his role as Ratso Rizzo in the film, Hoffman received his second Oscar nomination and the film won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a> honor. This was followed by his role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Big_Man" title="Little Big Man">Little Big Man</a></i> (1970) where Jack Crabb, his character, ages from teenager to a 121-year-old man. The film was widely praised by critics, but was overlooked for an award except for a supporting nomination for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Dan_George" title="Chief Dan George">Chief Dan George</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hoffman continued to appear in major films over the next few years. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Is_Harry_Kellerman_and_Why_Is_He_Saying_Those_Terrible_Things_About_Me%3F" title="Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?">Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?</a></i> (1971), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_Dogs" title="Straw Dogs">Straw Dogs</a></i> (also 1971), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillon_(film)" title="Papillon (film)">Papillon</a></i> (1973) were followed by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_(film)" title="Lenny (film)">Lenny</a></i> (1974), for which Hoffman received his third nomination for Best Actor in seven years.</p>

Hoffman's next roles were less successful. He opted out of directing <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Time" title="Straight Time">Straight Time</a></i> (1978) but starred as a thief.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hoffman then turned to television in the role of Willy Loman in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_Salesman_(1985_film)" title="Death of a Salesman (1985 film)">Death of a Salesman</a></i>, for which he won the 1985 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding lead actor in a TV movie or miniseries.

The film faced severe production problems, received almost completely negative reviews from critics and was nominated for three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razzie" title="Razzie">Razzie</a> awards. However, Hoffman and Beatty liked the film's final cut and tried to defend it.

Levinson, Hoffman and Cruise worked for two years on the film, and his performance garnered Hoffman his second Academy Award. Upon accepting, Hoffman stated softly to his fellow nominees that it was okay if they didn't vote for him because "I didn't vote for you guys either." After <i>Rain Man</i>, Hoffman appeared with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Connery" title="Sean Connery">Sean Connery</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Broderick" title="Matthew Broderick">Matthew Broderick</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Business_(film)" title="Family Business (film)">Family Business</a></i>.

	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film follows the story of a young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texan</a> named Joe Buck (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Voight" title="Jon Voight">Jon Voight</a>), who works as a dishwasher in a diner. As the film opens, Joe dresses himself like a rodeo cowboy, packs a suitcase, and quits his job. He heads to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> in the hope of leading the life of a male hustler.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Joe's naÃ¯vetÃ© becomes evident as quickly as his cash disappears upon his arrival in New York. He is unsuccessful in his attempts to be hired by wealthy women. When finally successful in bedding a middle-aged New Yorker (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Miles" title="Sylvia Miles">Sylvia Miles</a>), Joe's attempt to "talk business" results in the woman breaking down in tears and Joe giving <i>her</i> $20 instead. Joe meets the crippled Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>), a third-rate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_man" title="Confidence man">con man</a> who easily tricks Joe out of twenty dollars by offering to introduce him to a well-known pimp, who instead turns out to be a religious fanatic (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGiver" title="John McGiver">John McGiver</a>). Joe flees the scene in pursuit of Ratso, but he is long gone.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once broke, Joe is locked out of his hotel room for failure to pay the bill. He finally attempts to make money by submitting to oral sex from a young man in the seats of a movie theatre, but even this plan goes awry when the teenager (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Balaban" title="Bob Balaban">Bob Balaban</a>) reveals he has no money. The next day, Joe spots an unsuspecting Rizzo at a lunch counter. He angrily shakes Ratso down for every penny he has â€” all sixty-four of them â€” but Ratso surprisingly offers to help Joe, by sharing his place, an apartment in a condemned building. Joe reluctantly accepts the offer, and they begin a business relationship, helping each other pickpocket, steal and further attempt to get Joe hired as a stud. They are both completely alone without each other, and a genuine bond develops between the two men. Ratso had a cough when the two first met during the summer, and as the story progresses into winter, his health steadily worsens.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The events of Joe's early life are told through fast-cutting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashbacks</a> interspersed throughout the film. He had been to church and baptized as a boy, but has only frightening memories of the experience. The two people Joe had loved were his grandmother, Sally Buck, and his onetime girlfriend, Crazy Annie. His grandmother raised Joe after his mother abandoned him, but often left him alone to go off with boyfriends; one of them, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrangler_(profession)" title="Wrangler (profession)">wrangler</a> named Woodsy Niles, was Joe's only father figure. Annie had been a promiscuous girl who changed her ways after meeting Joe, but this did not sit well with the men of their hometown: the two were caught and raped by a gang of males. Annie was later sent to a mental institution; Joe joined the army. Sally Buck died while Joe was away serving in the Army, and Annie remained a constant presence in Joe's mind.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At one point, an odd-looking couple approach Joe and Ratso in a diner and hand Joe a flyer inviting him to a party. They enter into a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Factory" title="The Factory">Warhol-esque</a> party scene (with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhol_superstars" title="Warhol superstars">Warhol superstars</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_(Warhol_superstar)" title="Viva (Warhol superstar)">Viva</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Violet_(Isabelle_Collin_Dufresne)" title="Ultra Violet (Isabelle Collin Dufresne)">Ultra Violet</a> and others in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance" title="Cameo appearance">cameo appearances</a>). The naive Joe smokes most of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_(cannabis)" title="Joint (cannabis)">joint</a> thinking it's a cigarette, then takes a pill offered to him and begins to hallucinate. He leaves the party with a socialite (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Vaccaro" title="Brenda Vaccaro">Brenda Vaccaro</a>), who agrees to pay him $20 for spending the night with her. Ratso falls down a flight of stairs as they are leaving, but insists he is fine. Joe and the socialite attempt to have sex, but he suffers from temporary impotence. They play a word game together in which Joe reveals his limited academic prowess. She teasingly suggests that Joe may be a homosexual, and that does the trick: he is suddenly able to perform, and the two have lively, aggressive sex. In the morning, the socialite sets up a friend of hers to be Joe's next customer, and it appears his career is on its way.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Joe returns home later, Ratso is in bed, sweating and feverish, and admits to Joe that he is unable to walk. Joe wants to take Ratso to a doctor, but Ratso adamantly refuses. He wants to leave New York for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a>; this has been his goal the whole time. A frightened Joe is determined to take care of his friend, and leaves the apartment to scrounge some money. He picks up an older male customer (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard_Hughes" title="Barnard Hughes">Barnard Hughes</a>), but the man tries to send him away at the last minute out of guilt. Joe's desperation boils over when the man gives him a religious medallion instead of cash. He beats and robs the man, stuffing the telephone receiver into his mouth when he thinks the man is calling the hotel front desk for help.</p>

To prove he could do it, he asked the auditioning film executive to meet him on a street corner in Manhattan, and in the meantime, dressed himself in filthy rags. The executive arrived at the appointed corner and waited, barely noticing the beggar less than ten feet away who was accosting people for spare change. At last, the beggar walked up to him and revealed his true identity.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite his portrayal of Joe Buck, a character hopelessly out of his element in New York, Jon Voight is a native New Yorker, hailing from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonkers" title="Yonkers">Yonkers</a>.

The cab was driven by a hired actor during a scripted take, and the production team filmed it to <i>look</i> like an ad-lib.
