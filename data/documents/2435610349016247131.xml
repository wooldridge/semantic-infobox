      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He became a favorite actor of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">director</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Wilder" title="Billy Wilder">Billy Wilder</a>, starring in his films <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some_Like_It_Hot" title="Some Like It Hot">Some Like It Hot</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apartment" title="The Apartment">The Apartment</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irma_la_Douce" title="Irma la Douce">Irma la Douce</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fortune_Cookie" title="The Fortune Cookie">The Fortune Cookie</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avanti!" title="Avanti!">Avanti!</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Front_Page_(1974_film)" title="The Front Page (1974 film)">The Front Page</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Buddy" title="Buddy Buddy">Buddy Buddy</a></i>. Wilder felt Lemmon had a natural tendency toward overacting that had to be tempered; the Wilder biography <i>Nobody's Perfect</i> quotes the director as saying, "Lemmon, I would describe him as a ham, a fine ham, and with ham you have to trim a little fat". The biography also quotes Jack Lemmon as saying, "I am particularly susceptible to the parts I play... If my character was having a nervous breakdown, I started to have one".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He also had a longtime working relationship with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Edwards" title="Blake Edwards">Blake Edwards</a>, starring in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Wine_and_Roses_(film)" title="Days of Wine and Roses (film)">Days of Wine and Roses</a></i> (1962), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Race" title="The Great Race">The Great Race</a></i> (1965) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_Life!" title="That's Life!">That's Life!</a></i> (1986).</p>

Twelve jazz tracks were created for Lemmon and another twelve were added. Lemmon played the piano and recorded his own versions of Monroe's trademark songs, <i>I Wanna Be Loved By You</i> and <i>I'm Through With Love</i>, for the album which was released in 1959 as <i>A Twist of Lemmon/Some Like It Hot</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lemmon was awarded the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor">Best Supporting Actor Oscar</a> in 1956 for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Roberts_(1955_film)" title="Mister Roberts (1955 film)">Mister Roberts</a></i> (1955) and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Best Actor Oscar</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_the_Tiger" title="Save the Tiger">Save the Tiger</a></i> (1973), becoming the first actor to achieve this double.

He portrayed Joe Clay, a young, fun-loving alcoholic businessman. In that film, Lemmon delivered the line, "My name is Joe Clay ... I'm an alcoholic." Three and a half decades later, he admitted on the television program, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_Actors_Studio" title="Inside the Actors Studio">Inside the Actors Studio</a></i>, that he was not acting when he delivered that line, that he really was a recovering alcoholic at the end of his life.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lemmon's production company JML produced <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Hand_Luke" title="Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand Luke</a></i> in 1967. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a> was grateful to Lemmon for his support and offered him the role later made famous by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Cassidy_and_the_Sundance_Kid" title="Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a></i> but Lemmon turned it down. He did not like riding horses and he also felt he'd already played too many aspects of the Sundance Kid's character before.</p>

	<li>I won't quit until I get run over by a truck, a producer or a critic.</li>
	<li>Failure seldom stops you. What stops you is the fear of failure.</li>
	<li>If you think it's hard to meet new people, try picking up the wrong golf ball.</li>
	<li>It's hard enough to write a good drama, it's much harder to write a good comedy, and it's hardest of all to write a drama with comedy. Which is what life is.</li>
	<li>Nobody deserves this much money - certainly not an actor.</li>
	<li>Stay humble. Always answer your phone - no matter who else is in the car.</li>
	<li>[on Marilyn Monroe] Difficult? Yes. But she was a wonderful comedienne and she had a charisma like no one before or since.</li>
	<li>[on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Holliday" title="Judy Holliday">Judy Holliday</a>] She was intelligent and not at all like the dumb blonds she so often depicted. She didn't give a damn where the camera was placed, how she was made to look, or about being a star. She just played the sceneâ€”acted with, not at. She was also one of the nicest people I ever met.</li>
	<li>[on Billy Wilder] I've had directors who were marvelous at breaking scenes down and handling people. But when you would string all the pearls together, they wouldn't make a beautiful necklace. But Billy is the kind of picture-maker who can make a beautiful string of pearls. He makes the kind of movies that are classics and last forever.</li>
	<li>[on Walter Matthau] Walter is a helluva actor. The best I've ever worked with.</li>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C. C. Baxter (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lemmon" title="Jack Lemmon">Jack Lemmon</a>) is a lonely office drone for an insurance company in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>. Four different company managers take turns commandeering Baxter's apartment, which is located on West 67th Street on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_West_Side" title="Upper West Side">Upper West Side</a>, for their various extramarital liaisons. Unhappy with the situation, but unwilling to challenge them directly, he juggles their conflicting demands while hoping to catch the eye of fetching elevator operator Fran Kubelik (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_MacLaine" title="Shirley MacLaine">Shirley MacLaine</a>). Meanwhile the neighbors in the apartment building assume Baxter is a "good time Charlie" who brings home a different drunken woman every night. Baxter accepts their criticism rather than reveal the truth.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four managers write glowing reports about BaxterÂ â€” a little too glowing, so personnel director Mr. Sheldrake (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_MacMurray" title="Fred MacMurray">Fred MacMurray</a>) suspects something illicit behind the praise. Sheldrake lets Baxter's promotion go unchallenged on condition that he be allowed to use the apartment as well, starting that night. Sheldrake gives Baxter two tickets to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_Man" title="The Music Man">The Music Man</a></i> to ensure his absence. Delighted about his promotion, Baxter asks Miss Kubelik to meet him at the theatre. She agrees and it is revealed to the audience that she is Sheldrake's girlfriend, intending to break off their affair that night but is instead charmed by Sheldrake to the apartment. Baxter is disappointed at being stood up, but is willing to forgive Miss Kubelik.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At an office party on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Eve" title="Christmas Eve">Christmas Eve</a>, Baxter discovers the relationship between Sheldrake and Miss Kubelik, though he conceals this realization, while Miss Kubelik learns from Sheldrake's secretary that she is merely the latest female employee to be his mistress, the secretary herself having filled that role several years earlier. At the apartment, Miss Kubelik confronts Sheldrake with this information and while he maintains that he genuinely loves her, he leaves to return to his family. Meanwhile, a depressed Baxter picks up a woman in a local bar and, upon returning the apartment, is astounded to find Miss Kubelik in his bed, fully clothed and overdosed on Baxter's sleeping pills.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Baxter sends his bar pickup home and enlists the help of his neighbour, a physician, in reviving Miss Kubelik without notifying the authorities. The doctor makes various assumptions about Miss Kubelik and Baxter, which Baxter concedes without revealing Sheldrake's involvement. Baxter later telephones Sheldrake and informs him of the situation, and while Sheldrake professes gratitude for Baxter's quiet handling of the matter, he avoids any further involvement. Miss Kubelik recuperates in Baxter's apartment under his care for two days, during which he tries to entertain and distract her from any possible suicidal afterthoughts, talking her into playing numerous hands of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_rummy" title="Gin rummy">gin rummy</a>, though she is largely uninterested.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sheldrake, angered at his secretary for sharing the truth with Miss Kubelik, fires her. She retaliates by telling his wife about his infidelities, leading to the breakup of the marriage. Sheldrake moves into a room at his athletic club and continues to string Miss Kubelik along while he enjoys his newfound bachelorhood. Baxter finally takes a stand when Sheldrake demands the apartment for another liaison with Miss Kubelik on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve" title="New Year's Eve">New Year's Eve</a>, which results in Baxter quitting the firm. When Miss Kubelik hears of this from Sheldrake, she realizes that Baxter is the man who truly loves her and abandons him, running to the apartment. Baxter, in the midst of packing to move out, is bewildered by her appearance and her insistence on resuming their earlier game of gin rummy. When he declares his love for her, her reply is the now-famous final line of the movie: "Shut up and deal."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Immediately following the success of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some_Like_It_Hot" title="Some Like It Hot">Some Like It Hot</a></i>, Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond wished to make another film with Jack Lemmon. Wilder had originally planned to cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Douglas_(actor)" title="Paul Douglas (actor)">Paul Douglas</a> as Jeff Sheldrake; however, after he died unexpectedly, Fred MacMurray was cast.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial concept for the film came from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_Encounter" title="Brief Encounter">Brief Encounter</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Coward" title="Noel Coward">Noel Coward</a>, in which the main character used a friend's apartment to meet with a married woman. However, due to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Production_Code" title="Hays Production Code">Hays Production Code</a>, Wilder was unable to make a film about adultery in the 1940s. Wilder and Diamond also based the film partially on a Hollywood scandal in which high-powered agent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennings_Lang" title="Jennings Lang">Jennings Lang</a> was shot by producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Wanger" title="Walter Wanger">Walter Wanger</a> for having an affair with Wanger's wife, actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Bennett" title="Joan Bennett">Joan Bennett</a>. During the affair, Lang used a low-level employee's apartment. Another element of the plot was based on the experience of one of Diamond's friends who returned home after breaking up with his girlfriend to find that she had committed suicide in his bed.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Art director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Trauner" title="Alexandre Trauner">Alexandre Trauner</a> used forced perspective to create the set of a large insurance company office. The set appeared to be a long room full of desks and workers; however, successively smaller people and desks were placed to the back of the room ending up with dwarfs. He designed the set of Baxter's apartment to appear smaller and shabbier than the spacious apartments that usually appeared in films of the day. He used items from thrift stores and even some of Wilder's own furniture for the set.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The "Theme from the Apartment" was written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Williams_(composer)" title="Charles Williams (composer)">Charles Williams</a> and was originally titled "Jealous Lover", which was first heard in the 1949 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Romantic_Age" title="The Romantic Age">The Romantic Age</a></i>.</p>
