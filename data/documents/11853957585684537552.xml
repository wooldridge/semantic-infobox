	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock</b>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="Order of the British Empire">KBE</a> (13 August 1899Â â€“ 29 April 1980) was an English filmmaker and producer. He pioneered many techniques in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspense" title="Suspense">suspense</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_thriller" title="Psychological thriller">psychological thriller</a> genres. After a successful career in his native United Kingdom in both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film" title="Silent film">silent films</a> and early <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film" title="Sound film">talkies</a>, Hitchcock moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. In 1956 he became an American citizen while remaining a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_subject" title="British subject">British subject</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over a career spanning more than half a century, Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognisable directorial style. Viewers are made to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_(psychology)" title="Identification (psychology)">identify</a> with the camera which moves in a way meant to mimic a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeurism" title="Voyeurism">voyeurism</a>. He framed shots to manipulate the feelings of the audience and maximise anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing" title="Film editing">film editing</a> to demonstrate the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_shot" title="Point of view shot">point of view</a> of the characters. His stories frequently feature fugitives on the run from the law alongside "icy blonde" female characters. Many of Hitchcock's films have <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_ending" title="Twist ending">twist endings</a> and thrilling plots featuring depictions of violence, murder, and crime, although many of the mysteries function as decoys or "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin" title="MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a>" meant only to serve thematic elements in the film and the extremely complex psychological examinations of the characters. Hitchcock's films also borrow many themes from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> and feature strong sexual undertones. Through <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hitchcock_cameo_appearances" title="List of Hitchcock cameo appearances">his cameo appearances</a> in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and the television program <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents" title="Alfred Hitchcock Presents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a></i>, he became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon" title="Cultural icon">cultural icon</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain's <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, which said: "Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else." <i>MovieMaker</i> has hailed him as the most influential filmmaker of all time, and he is widely regarded as one of cinema's most significant artists.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leytonstone" title="Leytonstone">Leytonstone</a>, London, the second son and youngest of three children of William Hitchcock (1862â€“1914), a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greengrocer" title="Greengrocer">greengrocer</a> and poulterer, and Emma Jane Hitchcock (<i>nÃ©e</i> Whelan; 1863â€“1942). He was named after his father's brother, Alfred. His family was mostly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, with his mother and paternal grandmother being of Irish extraction. Hitchcock was sent to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus" title="Society of Jesus">Jesuit</a> Classic school <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Ignatius%27_College" title="St Ignatius' College">St Ignatius' College</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Hill" title="Stamford Hill">Stamford Hill</a>, London. He often described his childhood as being very lonely and sheltered, a situation compounded by his obesity.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock said he was sent by his father on numerous occasions to the local police station with a note asking the officer to lock him away for ten minutes as punishment for behaving badly. This idea of being harshly treated or wrongfully accused is frequently reflected in Hitchcock's films. Hitchcock's mother would often make him address her while standing at the foot of her bed, especially if he behaved badly, forcing him to stand there for hours. These experiences would later be used for the portrayal of the character of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Bates" title="Norman Bates">Norman Bates</a> in his movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)" title="Psycho (1960 film)">Psycho</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock's father died when he was 14. In the same year, Hitchcock left St. Ignatius to study at the London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poplar,_London" title="Poplar, London">Poplar</a>, London. After graduating, he became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_drawing" title="Technical drawing">draftsman</a> and advertising designer with a cable company.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During this period, Hitchcock became intrigued by photography and started working in film production in London, working as a title-card designer for the London branch of what would become <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. In 1920, he received a full-time position at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoxton" title="Hoxton">Islington Studios</a> with its American owner, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famous_Players-Lasky" title="Famous Players-Lasky">Famous Players-Lasky</a> and their British successor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainsborough_Pictures" title="Gainsborough Pictures">Gainsborough Pictures</a>, designing the titles for silent movies. His rise from title designer to film director took five years.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock's last collaboration with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Cutts" title="Graham Cutts">Graham Cutts</a> led him to Germany in 1924. The film <i>Die Prinzessin und der Geiger</i> (UK title <i>The Blackguard</i>, 1925), directed by Cutts and co-written by Hitchcock, was produced in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babelsberg_Studios" title="Babelsberg Studios">Babelsberg Studios</a> in Potsdam near Berlin. Hitchcock also observed part of the making of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Murnau" title="F. W. Murnau">F. W. Murnau</a>'s film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_letzte_Mann" title="Der letzte Mann">Der letzte Mann</a></i> (1924). He was very impressed with Murnau's work and later used many techniques for the set design in his own productions. In his book-length interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" title="FranÃ§ois Truffaut">FranÃ§ois Truffaut</a>, <i>Hitchcock/Truffaut</i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_and_Schuster" title="Simon and Schuster">Simon and Schuster</a>, 1967), Hitchcock also said he was influenced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Lang" title="Fritz Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_(1921_film)" title="Destiny (1921 film)">Destiny</a></i> (1921).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock's first few films faced a string of bad luck. His first directing project came in 1922 with the aptly titled <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_13_(film)" title="Number 13 (film)">Number 13</a></i>. However, the production was cancelled due to financial problems and the few scenes that were finished at that point were apparently lost. In 1925, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Balcon" title="Michael Balcon">Michael Balcon</a> of Gainsborough Pictures gave Hitchcock another opportunity for a directing credit with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pleasure_Garden_(1925_film)" title="The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)">The Pleasure Garden</a></i> made at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universum_Film_AG" title="Universum Film AG">UFA Studios</a> in Germany; unfortunately, the film was a commercial flop. Next, Hitchcock directed a drama called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Eagle" title="The Mountain Eagle">The Mountain Eagle</a></i> (possibly released under the title <i>Fear o' God</i> in the United States). This film was also eventually lost. In 1926, Hitchcock's luck changed with his first thriller, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lodger:_A_Story_of_the_London_Fog" title="The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog">The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog</a></i>. The film, released in January 1927, was a major commercial and critical success in the United Kingdom. As with many of his earlier works, this film was influenced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Expressionism" title="German Expressionism">Expressionist</a> techniques Hitchcock had witnessed first-hand in Germany. Some commentators regard this piece as the first truly "Hitchcockian" film, incorporating such themes as the "wrong man".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the success of <i>The Lodger</i>, Hitchcock hired a publicist to help enhance his growing reputation. On 2 December 1926, Hitchcock married his assistant director, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_Reville" title="Alma Reville">Alma Reville</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Immaculate_Heart_of_Mary" title="Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary">Brompton Oratory</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Kensington" title="South Kensington">South Kensington</a>. Their only child, daughter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Hitchcock" title="Patricia Hitchcock">Patricia</a>, was born on 7 July 1928. Alma was to become Hitchcock's closest collaborator. Alma's contribution to his films (some of which were credited on screen) had always been privately acknowledged by Hitchcock, as she was keen to avoid public attention.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1929, Hitchcock began work on his tenth film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail_(1929_film)" title="Blackmail (1929 film)">Blackmail</a></i>. While the film was still in production, the studio, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_International_Pictures" title="British International Pictures">British International Pictures</a> (BIP), decided to convert it to sound. As an early '<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film#Transition:_Europe" title="Sound film">talkie</a>', the film is frequently cited by film historians as a landmark film, and is often considered to be the first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Cinema of the United Kingdom">British</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkie" title="Talkie">sound</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film" title="Feature film">feature film</a>. With the climax of the film taking place on the dome of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum" title="British Museum">British Museum</a>, <i>Blackmail</i> began the Hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as a backdrop for suspense sequences. In the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS" title="PBS">PBS</a> series <i>The Men Who Made The Movies</i>, Hitchcock explained how he used early sound recording as a special element of the film, emphasising the word "knife" in a conversation with the woman suspected of murder. During this period, Hitchcock directed segments for a BIP <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_film" title="Musical film">musical film</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revue" title="Revue">revue</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elstree_Calling" title="Elstree Calling">Elstree Calling</a></i> (1930) and directed a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film" title="Short film">short film</a> featuring two <i>Film Weekly</i> scholarship winners, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Elastic_Affair" title="An Elastic Affair">An Elastic Affair</a></i> (1930). Another BIP musical revue, <i>Harmony Heaven</i> (1929), reportedly had minor input from Hitchcock, but his name does not appear in the credits.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1933, Hitchcock was once again working for Michael Balcon at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaumont_British" title="Gaumont British">Gaumont-British Picture Corporation</a>. His first film for the company, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Knew_Too_Much_(1934_film)" title="The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a></i> (1934), was a success and his second, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_39_Steps_(1935_film)" title="The 39 Steps (1935 film)">The 39 Steps</a></i> (1935), is often considered one of the best films from his early period. This film was also one of the first to introduce the concept of the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin" title="MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>", a plot device around which a whole story seems to revolve, but ultimately has nothing to do with the true meaning or ending of the story. In <i>The 39 Steps</i>, the Macguffin is a stolen set of design plans. Hitchcock told French director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" title="FranÃ§ois Truffaut">FranÃ§ois Truffaut</a>:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock's next major success was his 1938 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_Vanishes_(1938_film)" title="The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)">The Lady Vanishes</a></i>, a fast-paced film about the search for a kindly old Englishwoman Miss Froy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_May_Whitty" title="Dame May Whitty">Dame May Whitty</a>), who disappears while on board a train in the fictional country of Bandrika.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 1938, Hitchcock had become known for his alleged observation, "Actors are cattle". He once said that he first made this remark as early as the late 1920s, in connection to stage actors who were snobbish about motion pictures. However, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Redgrave" title="Michael Redgrave">Michael Redgrave</a> said that Hitchcock had made the statement during the filming of <i>The Lady Vanishes</i>. The phrase would haunt Hitchcock for years to come and would result in an incident during the filming of his 1941 production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._%26_Mrs._Smith_(1941_film)" title="Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</a></i>, where <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Lombard" title="Carole Lombard">Carole Lombard</a> brought some heifers onto the set with name tags of Lombard, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_(actor)" title="Robert Montgomery (actor)">Robert Montgomery</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Raymond" title="Gene Raymond">Gene Raymond</a>, the stars of the film, to surprise the director. Hitchcock said he was misquoted: "I said 'Actors should be <i>treated</i> like cattle'."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of the 1930s, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David O. Selznick</a> signed Hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in March 1939, when the Hitchcocks moved to the United States.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Hollywood">Hollywood</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The suspense and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallows_humor" title="Gallows humor">gallows humour</a> that had become Hitchcock's trademark in film continued to appear in his productions. The working arrangements with Selznick were less than optimal. Selznick suffered from perennial money problems, and Hitchcock was often displeased with Selznick's creative control over his films. In a later interview, Hitchcock summarised the working relationship thus:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selznick loaned Hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing Hitchcock's films himself. In addition, Selznick, as well as fellow independent producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn" title="Samuel Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a>, made only a few films each year, so Selznick did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. Hitchcock was quickly impressed with the superior resources of the American studios compared to the financial restrictions he had frequently encountered in England.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock's fondness for his homeland resulted in numerous American films set in, or filmed in, the United Kingdom, including his penultimate film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenzy" title="Frenzy">Frenzy</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the prestigious Selznick picture <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_(film)" title="Rebecca (film)">Rebecca</a></i> in 1940, Hitchcock made his first American movie, set in England and based on a novel by English author <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_du_Maurier" title="Daphne du Maurier">Daphne du Maurier</a>. The film starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Fontaine" title="Joan Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>. This <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_novel" title="Gothic novel">Gothic</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama" title="Melodrama">melodrama</a> explores the fears of a naive young bride who enters a great English country home and must adapt to the extreme formality and coldness she finds there. The film won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a> of 1940. The statuette was given to Selznick, as the film's producer. The film did not win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Best Director</a> award for Hitchcock.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were additional problems between Selznick and Hitchcock. Selznick was known to impose very restrictive rules upon Hitchcock, forcing him to shoot the film as Selznick wanted. At the same time, Selznick complained about Hitchcock's "goddamn jigsaw cutting", which meant that the producer did not have nearly the leeway to create his own film as he liked, but had to follow Hitchcock's vision of the finished product. <i>Rebecca</i> was the fourth longest of Hitchcock's films, at 130Â minutes, exceeded only by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradine_Case" title="The Paradine Case">The Paradine Case</a></i> (132Â minutes), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_by_Northwest" title="North by Northwest">North by Northwest</a></i> (136Â minutes), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topaz_(1969_film)" title="Topaz (1969 film)">Topaz</a></i> (142Â minutes).</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock's films during the 1940s were diverse, ranging from the romantic comedy <i>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</i> (1941) to the courtroom drama <i>The Paradine Case</i> (1947), to the dark and disturbing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" title="Film noir">film noir</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_a_Doubt" title="Shadow of a Doubt">Shadow of a Doubt</a></i> (1943).</p>

This film was to be actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a>'s first time working with Hitchcock, and it was one of the few times that Grant would be cast in a sinister role.

"Grant plays an irresponsible husband whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his wife (Fontaine)". In what critics regard as a classic scene, Hitchcock uses a light bulb to illuminate what might be a fatal glass of milk that Grant is bringing to his wife. In the book upon which the movie is based (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_the_Fact" title="Before the Fact">Before the Fact</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Iles" title="Francis Iles">Francis Iles</a>), the Grant character is a killer, but Hitchcock and the studio felt Grant's image would be tarnished by that ending. Though a homicide would have suited him better, as he stated to FranÃ§ois Truffaut, Hitchcock settled for an ambiguous finale.</p>

The action sequences were shot on the small boat. The locale also posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Returning to England for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944, Hitchcock made two short films for the Ministry of Information, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Voyage_(1944_film)" title="Bon Voyage (1944 film)">Bon Voyage</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aventure_Malgache" title="Aventure Malgache">Aventure Malgache</a></i>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1945, Hitchcock served as "treatment advisor" (in effect, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editor" title="Film editor">film editor</a>) for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">Holocaust</a> documentary produced by the British Army.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock worked for Selznick again when he directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbound_(1945_film)" title="Spellbound (1945 film)">Spellbound</a></i>, which explored <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> and featured a dream sequence designed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD" title="Salvador DalÃ­">Salvador DalÃ­</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a> plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrid_Bergman" title="Ingrid Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>), who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past. The dream sequence as it actually appears in the film is considerably shorter than was originally envisioned, which was to be several minutes long, because it proved to be too disturbing for the audience.

According to Hitchcock, in his book-length interview with FranÃ§ois Truffaut, Selznick sold the director, the two stars (Grant and Bergman) and the screenplay (by Ben Hecht) to RKO Radio Pictures as a "package" for $500,000 due to cost overruns on Selznick's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel_in_the_Sun_(film)" title="Duel in the Sun (film)">Duel in the Sun</a></i> (1946). <i>Notorious</i> starred Hitchcock regulars Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant, and features a plot about Nazis, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, and South America. It was a huge box office success and has remained one of Hitchcock's most acclaimed films. His use of uranium as a plot device led to Hitchcock's being briefly under FBI surveillance.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After completing his final film for Selznick, <i>The Paradine Case</i> (a courtroom drama that critics found lost momentum because it apparently ran too long and exhausted its resource of ideas), Hitchcock filmed his first color film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(film)" title="Rope (film)">Rope</a></i>, which appeared in 1948. Here Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboat_(film)" title="Lifeboat (film)">Lifeboat</a></i> (1943). He also experimented with exceptionally long takes â€” up to ten minutes long. Featuring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart" title="James Stewart">James Stewart</a> in the leading role, <i>Rope</i> was the first of four films Stewart would make for Hitchcock. It was based on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_and_Loeb" title="Leopold and Loeb">Leopold and Loeb</a> case of the 1920s. Somehow Hitchcock's cameraman managed to move the bulky, heavy <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor" title="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> camera quickly around the set as it followed the continuous action of the long takes.</p>

He again used Technicolor in this production, then returned to black and white films for several years.

Hitchcock continued to produce his own films for the rest of his life.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1950, Hitchcock filmed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_Fright_(film)" title="Stage Fright (film)">Stage Fright</a></i> on location in the UK.

Hitchcock experimented with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_film" title="3-D film">3D</a> cinematography, although the film was not released in this format at first. However, it was shown in 3D in the early 1980s. The film marked a return to Technicolor productions for Hitchcock.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock then moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> and filmed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_Window" title="Rear Window">Rear Window</a></i> (1954), starring James Stewart and Kelly again, as well as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Ritter" title="Thelma Ritter">Thelma Ritter</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Burr" title="Raymond Burr">Raymond Burr</a>. Stewart's character, a photographer based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Capa" title="Robert Capa">Robert Capa</a>, must temporarily use a wheelchair; out of boredom he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, and becomes convinced one of them (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Burr" title="Raymond Burr">Raymond Burr</a>) has murdered his wife. Stewart tries to sway both his glamorous model-girlfriend (Kelly) and his policeman buddy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Corey" title="Wendell Corey">Wendell Corey</a>) to his theory, and eventually succeeds. Like <i>Lifeboat</i> and <i>Rope</i>, the movie was photographed almost entirely within the confines of a small space: Stewart's tiny studio apartment overlooking the massive courtyard set. Hitchcock used closeups of Stewart's face to show his character's reactions to all he sees, "from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbors to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain's apartment".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third Kelly film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Catch_a_Thief_(film)" title="To Catch a Thief (film)">To Catch a Thief</a></i> (1955), set in the French Riviera, paired Kelly with Cary Grant again. Grant plays retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera. An American heiress played by Kelly surmises his true identity, attempts to seduce him. "Despite the obvious age disparity between Grant and Kelly and a lightweight plot, the witty script (loaded with double-entendres) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success." It was Hitchcock's last film with Kelly. She married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rainier" title="Prince Rainier">Prince Rainier</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco" title="Monaco">Monaco</a> in 1956, and the residents of her new land were against her making any more films.</p>

This was the only film of Hitchcock's to star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>.

Scottie's obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending. Though the film is widely considered a classic today, <i>Vertigo</i> met with negative reviews and poor box office receipts upon its release, and marked the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock. The film is ranked second (behind <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i>) in the 2002 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_and_Sound" title="Sight and Sound">Sight &amp; Sound</a></i> decade poll.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By this time, Hitchcock had filmed in many areas of the United States. He followed <i>Vertigo</i> with three more successful films.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>North by Northwest</i>, Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Psycho</i> is considered by some to be Hitchcock's most famous film. Produced on a highly constrained budget of $800,000, it was shot in black-and-white on a spare set. The unprecedented violence of the shower scene, the early demise of the heroine, the innocent lives extinguished by a disturbed murderer were all hallmarks of Hitchcock, copied in many subsequent horror films. After completing <i>Psycho</i>, Hitchcock moved to Universal, where he made the remainder of his films.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Birds</i>, inspired by a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Du_Maurier" title="Daphne Du Maurier">Daphne Du Maurier</a> short story and by an actual news story about a mysterious infestation of birds in California, was Hitchcock's 49th film. He signed up <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippi_Hedren" title="Tippi Hedren">Tippi Hedren</a> as his latest blonde heroine opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Taylor" title="Rod Taylor">Rod Taylor</a>. The scenes of the birds attacking included hundreds of shots mixing actual and animated sequences. The cause of the birds' attack is left unanswered, "perhaps highlighting the mystery of forces unknown".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The latter two films were particularly notable for their unconventional soundtracks, both orchestrated by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>: the screeching strings played in the murder scene in <i>Psycho</i> exceeded the limits of the time, and <i>The Birds</i> dispensed completely with conventional instruments, instead using an electronically produced soundtrack and an unaccompanied song by school children (just prior to the infamous attack at the historic Bodega Bay School). These films are considered his last great films, after which it is said his career started to lose pace (although some critics, such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Wood_(film_critic)" title="Robin Wood (film critic)">Robin Wood</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Spoto" title="Donald Spoto">Donald Spoto</a>, contend that <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnie_(film)" title="Marnie (film)">Marnie</a></i>, from 1964, is first-class Hitchcock, and some have argued that <i>Frenzy</i> is unfairly overlooked).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Failing health took its toll on Hitchcock, reducing his output during the last two decades of his career. Hitchcock filmed two spy thrillers. The first, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torn_Curtain" title="Torn Curtain">Torn Curtain</a></i> (1966), with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews" title="Julie Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>, was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> thriller. <i>Torn Curtain</i> displays the bitter end of the twelve-year collaboration between Hitchcock and composer Bernard Herrmann. Herrmann was fired when Hitchcock was unsatisfied with his score. In 1969, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topaz_(1969_film)" title="Topaz (1969 film)">Topaz</a></i>, another Cold War-themed film (based on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Uris" title="Leon Uris">Leon Uris</a> novel), was released. Both received mixed reviews from critics.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1972, Hitchcock returned to London to film <i>Frenzy</i>, his last major triumph. After two only moderately successful <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage" title="Espionage">espionage</a> films, the plot marks a return to the murder thriller genre that he made so many films out of earlier in his career. The basic story recycles his early film <i>The Lodger</i>. Richard Blaney (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Finch" title="Jon Finch">Jon Finch</a>), a volatile barkeeper with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect for the "Necktie Murders", which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Foster_(actor)" title="Barry Foster (actor)">Barry Foster</a>). This time, Hitchcock makes the victim and villain twins, rather than opposites, as in <i>Strangers on a Train</i>. Only one of them, however, has crossed the line to murder. For the first time, Hitchcock allowed nudity and profane language, which had before been taboo, in one of his films. He also shows rare sympathy for the chief inspector and his comic domestic life. Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Breen" title="Joseph Breen">Joseph Breen</a>, the longtime head of Hollywood's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_Code" title="Production Code">Production Code</a>. Many times Hitchcock slipped in subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet Patrick McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such things and were actually amused as well as alarmed by Hitchcock's "inescapable inferences". Beginning with <i>Torn Curtain</i>, Hitchcock was finally able to blatantly include plot elements previously forbidden in American films and this continued for the remainder of his film career.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Plot" title="Family Plot">Family Plot</a></i> (1976) was Hitchcock's last film. It related the escapades of "Madam" Blanche Tyler played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Harris_(actress)" title="Barbara Harris (actress)">Barbara Harris</a>, a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi driver lover <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dern" title="Bruce Dern">Bruce Dern</a> making a living from her phony powers. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Devane" title="William Devane">William Devane</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Black" title="Karen Black">Karen Black</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathleen_Nesbitt" title="Cathleen Nesbitt">Cathleen Nesbitt</a> co-starred. It was the only Hitchcock film scored by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Near the end of his life, Hitchcock had worked on the script for a projected spy thriller, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Short_Night" title="The Short Night">The Short Night</a></i>, collaborating with screenwriters <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Costigan" title="James Costigan">James Costigan</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Lehman" title="Ernest Lehman">Ernest Lehman</a>. Despite some preliminary work, the story was never filmed. This was due primarily to Hitchcock's own failing health and his concerns over the health of his wife, Alma, who had suffered a stroke. The script was eventually published posthumously, in a book on Hitchcock's last years.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock died on 29 April 1980, 9:17AM. He died peacefully in his sleep due to renal failure in his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel_Air,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="Bel Air, Los Angeles, California">Bel Air, Los Angeles</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> home at the age of 80, survived by his wife and their daughter. His funeral service was held at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Beverly Hills. Hitchcock's body was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremation" title="Cremation">cremated</a> and his ashes were scattered over the Pacific Ocean.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock returned several times to cinematic devices such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspense" title="Suspense">suspense</a>, the audience as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeur" title="Voyeur">voyeur</a>, and his well-known "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGuffin" title="McGuffin">McGuffin</a>", an apparently minor detail serving as a pivot upon which the narrative turns.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock seemed to delight in the technical challenges of film making. In the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboat_(film)" title="Lifeboat (film)">Lifeboat</a></i>, Hitchcock stages the entire action of the movie in a small boat, yet manages to keep the cinematography from monotonous repetition (his trademark cameo appearance was a dilemma, given the limitations of the setting; so Hitchcock appears in a fictitious magazine for a weight loss product). Similarly, the entire action in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_Window" title="Rear Window">Rear Window</a></i> either takes place in or is seen from a single apartment. In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbound_(1945_film)" title="Spellbound (1945 film)">Spellbound</a></i>, two unprecedented point-of-view shots were achieved by constructing a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and out-sized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on some copies of the black-and-white print of the film.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(film)" title="Rope (film)">Rope</a></i> (1948) was another technical challenge: a film that appears to have been shot entirely in a single take. The film was actually shot in 10 takes ranging from four and a half to 10Â minutes each; a 10Â minute length of film being the maximum a camera's film magazine could hold. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock's 1958 film <i>Vertigo</i> contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts that has been imitated and re-used many times by filmmakers, wherein the image appears to "stretch". This is achieved by moving the camera in the opposite direction of the camera's zoom. It has become known as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoom" title="Dolly zoom">Dolly zoom</a> or "Vertigo Effect."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock appeared briefly in many of his own films, usually playing upon his portly figure in an incongruous manner, for example, seen struggling to get a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bass" title="Double bass">double bass</a> onto a train, or walking dogs in the background.</p>

In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_(film)" title="The Birds (film)">The Birds</a></i> (1963), the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Taylor_(actor)" title="Rod Taylor (actor)">Rod Taylor</a> character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself of a clinging mother (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Tandy" title="Jessica Tandy">Jessica Tandy</a>). The killer in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenzy" title="Frenzy">Frenzy</a></i> (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother.

Norman Bates has troubles with his mother in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)" title="Psycho (1960 film)">Psycho</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock heroines tend to be lovely, cool blondes who seem proper at first but, when aroused by passion or danger, respond in a more sensual, animal, or even criminal way. The famous victims in <i>The Lodger</i> are all blondes. In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_39_Steps_(1935_film)" title="The 39 Steps (1935 film)">The 39 Steps</a></i>, Hitchcock's glamorous blonde star, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Carroll" title="Madeleine Carroll">Madeleine Carroll</a>, is put in handcuffs.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some critics and Hitchcock scholars, including Donald Spoto and Roger Ebert, agree that <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_(film)" title="Vertigo (film)">Vertigo</a></i> represents the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires. <i>Vertigo</i> explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other film in his filmography.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock often said that his favourite film (of his own work) was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_a_Doubt" title="Shadow of a Doubt">Shadow of a Doubt</a></i>.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Style_of_working">Style of working</span></h2>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>Writing with Hitchcock</i>, a book-length study of Hitchcock's working method with his writers, author Steven DeRosa noted that "Although he rarely did any actual 'writing', especially on his Hollywood productions, Hitchcock supervised and guided his writers through every draft, insisting on a strict attention to detail and a preference for telling the story through visual rather than verbal means. While this exasperated some writers, others admitted the director inspired them to do their very best work. Hitchcock often emphasised that he took no screen credit for the writing of his films. However, over time the work of many of his writers has been attributed solely to Hitchcockâ€™s creative genius, a misconception he rarely went out of his way to correct. Notwithstanding his technical brilliance as a director, Hitchcock relied on his writers a great deal."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock's films were strongly believed to have been extensively storyboarded to the finest detail by the majority of commentators over the years. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewfinder" title="Viewfinder">viewfinder</a>, since he didn't need to do so, though in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternate takes to consider.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, this view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by the book <i>Hitchcock At Work</i>, written by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahiers_du_cin%C3%A9ma" title="Cahiers du cinÃ©ma">Cahiers du cinÃ©ma</a></i>. Krohn, after investigating several script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock alongside inspection of storyboards, and other production material, has observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned. He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his movies was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. A great example would be the celebrated crop spraying sequence of <i>North by Northwest</i> which was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even on the occasions when storyboards were made, the scene which was shot did differ from it significantly. Krohn's extensive analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like <i>Notorious</i> reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of <i>The Man Who Knew Too Much,</i> whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something which, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangers_on_a_Train_(film)" title="Strangers on a Train (film)">Strangers on a Train</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topaz_(1969_film)" title="Topaz (1969 film)">Topaz</a></i>. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his movies, he was fully cognizant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His fastidiousness and attention to detail also found its way into each <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_poster" title="Film poster">film poster</a> for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his dayâ€”film poster designers such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gold" title="Bill Gold">Bill Gold</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass" title="Saul Bass">Saul Bass</a>â€”and kept them busy with countless rounds of revision until he felt that the single image of the poster accurately represented his entire film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, much of Hitchcock's supposed dislike of actors has been exaggerated. Hitchcock simply did not tolerate the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting" title="Method acting">method</a> approach, as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. In a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_and_Sound" title="Sight and Sound">Sight and Sound</a></i> interview, he stated that, 'the method actor is OK in the theatre because he has a free space to move about. But when it comes to cutting the face and what he sees and so forth, there must be some discipline'. During the making of <i>Lifeboat</i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Slezak" title="Walter Slezak">Walter Slezak</a>, who played the German character, stated that Hitchcock knew the mechanics of acting better than anyone he knew. Several critics have observed that despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors, several actors who worked with him gave fine, often brilliant performances and these performances contribute to the film's success.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock became famous for his expert and largely unrivaled control of pace and suspense, and his films draw heavily on both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear" title="Fear">fear</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a>. The films are known for their droll humour and witticisms, and these cinematic works often portray innocent people caught up in circumstances beyond their control or understanding.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock began his directing career in the United Kingdom in 1922. From 1939 onward, he worked primarily in the United States. In September 1940, Hitchcock had purchased a 200-acre (0.81 km) mountaintop estate for the sum of $40,000. Known as the 1870 Cornwall Ranch or 'Heart o' the Mountain', the property was perched high above <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotts_Valley" title="Scotts Valley">Scotts Valley</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, at the end of Canham Road. The Hitchcocks resided there from 1940 to 1972. The Hitchcocks became close friends with the parents of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Fontaine" title="Joan Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>, after she starred in his film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_(film)" title="Rebecca (film)">Rebecca</a></i>. Years later, after a break-in at his estate, Hitchcock replaced all of the accumulated paintings with studio-made copies. The family sold the estate in 1974, six years before Hitchcock's death.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock and family also purchased a second home in late 1942 at 10957 Bellagio Road in Los Angeles, just across from the Bel Air Country Club.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_(film)" title="Rebecca (film)">Rebecca</a></i> was the only Hitchcock film to win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a> (though the award did not go to Hitchcock but to producer David O.

Thalberg Memorial Award">Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award</a> for lifetime achievement. He never won an Academy Award for direction of a film.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>, Hitchcock was among the first prominent motion picture producers to fully envisage just how popular the medium of television would become. From 1955 to 1965, Hitchcock was the host and producer of a television series entitled <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents" title="Alfred Hitchcock Presents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a></i>. While his films had made Hitchcock's name strongly associated with suspense, the TV series made Hitchcock a celebrity himself. His <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony" title="Irony">irony</a>-tinged voice and signature droll delivery, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallows_humor" title="Gallows humor">gallows humor</a>, iconic image and mannerisms became instantly recognisable and were often the subject of parody.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The title-theme of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of Hitchcock's profile (he drew it himself; it is composed of only nine strokes) which his real silhouette then filled. His introductions before the stories in his program always included some sort of wry humor, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one electric chair, while two are now shown with a sign "Two chairs--no waiting!" He directed a few episodes of the TV series himself, and he upset a number of movie production companies when he insisted on using his TV production crew to produce his motion picture <i>Psycho</i>. In the late 1980s, a new version of <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_colorization" title="Film colorization">colorised</a> form.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> was parodied by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friz_Freleng" title="Friz Freleng">Friz Freleng</a>'s 1961 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon" title="Cartoon">cartoon</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Hungry_Cat" title="The Last Hungry Cat">The Last Hungry Cat</a></i>, which contains a plot similar to <i>Blackmail</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">"Hitch" used a curious little tune by the French composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gounod" title="Charles Gounod">Charles Gounod</a> (1818â€“1893), the composer of the 1859 opera <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust_(opera)" title="Faust (opera)">Faust</a></i>, as the theme "song" for his television programs, after it was suggested to him by composer Bernard Herrmann. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Fiedler" title="Arthur Fiedler">Arthur Fiedler</a> and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Pops_Orchestra" title="Boston Pops Orchestra">Boston Pops Orchestra</a> included the piece, <i>Funeral March of a Marionette</i>, in one of their extended play 45 rpm discs for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_Victor" title="RCA Victor">RCA Victor</a> during the 1950s.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock appears as a character in the popular juvenile detective book series, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Investigators" title="Three Investigators">Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators</a></i>. The long-running detective series was created by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Arthur_(writer)" title="Robert Arthur (writer)">Robert Arthur</a>, who wrote the first several books, although other authors took over after he left the series. The Three Investigatorsâ€”Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Peter Crenshawâ€”were amateur detectives, slightly younger than the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_Boys" title="Hardy Boys">Hardy Boys</a>. In the introduction to each book, "Alfred Hitchcock" introduces the mystery, and he sometimes refers a case to the boys to solve. At the end of each book, the boys report to Hitchcock, and sometimes give him a memento of their case.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the real Hitchcock died, the fictional Hitchcock in the Three Investigators books was replaced by a retired detective named Hector Sebastian. At this time, the series title was changed from <i>Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators</i> to <i>The Three Investigators</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the height of Hitchcock's success, he was also asked to introduce a set of books with his name attached. The series was a collection of short stories by popular short-story writers, primarily focused on suspense and thrillers. These titles included <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock%27s_Anthology" title="Alfred Hitchcock's Anthology">Alfred Hitchcock's Anthology</a></i>, <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories to be Read with the Door Locked</i>, <i>Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum</i>, <i>Alfred Hitchcock's Supernatural Tales of Terror and Suspense</i>, <i>Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbinders in Suspense</i>, <i>Alfred Hitchcock's Witch's Brew</i>, <i>Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery</i>, <i>Alfred Hitchcock's A Hangman's Dozen</i> and <i>Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful.</i> Hitchcock himself was not actually involved in the reading, reviewing, editing or selection of the short stories; in fact, even his introductions were ghost-written. The entire extent of his involvement with the project was to lend his name and collect a check.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some notable writers whose works were used in the collection, include <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Jackson" title="Shirley Jackson">Shirley Jackson</a> (<i>Strangers in Town</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lottery" title="The Lottery">The Lottery</a></i>), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.H._White" title="T.H.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock also wrote a mystery story for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_(American_magazine)" title="Look (American magazine)">Look</a></i> magazine in 1943, "The Murder of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Woolley" title="Monty Woolley">Monty Woolley</a>". This was a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to inspect the pictures for clues to the murderer's identity; Hitchcock cast the performers as themselves; such as Woolley, Doris Merrick and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_up" title="Make up">make up</a> man Guy Pearce, whom Hitchcock identified, in the last photo, as the murderer. The article was reprinted in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_(magazine)" title="Games (magazine)">Games</a></i> Magazine in November/December 1980.</p>
