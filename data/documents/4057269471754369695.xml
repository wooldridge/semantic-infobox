	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A woman hires <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator" title="Private investigator">private investigator</a> J.J. "Jake" Gittes (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>) to perform surveillance on Hollis Mulwray, the chief engineer for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> Department of Water and Power. The woman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Ladd" title="Diane Ladd">Diane Ladd</a>) claims to be Mulwray's wife Evelyn, who suspects him of adultery.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gittes tails Mulwray. In a public meeting about a proposed bond issue for new <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam" title="Dam">dam</a> construction, Mr. Mulwray argues that the proposed dam will be physically unsound and opposes the bond issue, which eventually passes. Following Mulwray to several Water and Power-related sites, they discover the dumping of fresh water into the ocean in spite of the late summer drought. Gittes's associate photographs Mulwray arguing with an elderly man outside the Pig 'n Whistle eatery in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, and only overhears the words "apple core" over traffic noise (a corruption of the word "albacore").</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gittes's tail finally hits paydirt when he photographs Mulwray with his young mistress. When the photos hit the front page of the paper the next day, Gittes is confronted by the <i>real</i> Evelyn Mulwray (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Dunaway" title="Faye Dunaway">Faye Dunaway</a>), who serves him with a lawsuit. Gittes realizes he had been duped by a phony Mrs. Mulwray, and to repair his reputation, he must figure out who was behind the hiring, and why.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gittes convinces Evelyn Mulwray that he was only unwittingly involved in her personal business and she agrees to dismiss her lawsuit. She nervously reveals that her maiden name was "Cross" and that Mulwray used to be her father's business partner. Visiting the Department of Water and Power, Gittes recognizes photographs of the same elderly man Mulwray was photographed quarreling with, and learns his name: Noah Cross (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John Huston</a>). Mulwray and Cross once privately owned the water department.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gittes looks for Mulwray at the Oak Pass reservoir but finds police detectives there instead, including Lt. Lou Escobar (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Lopez" title="Perry Lopez">Perry Lopez</a>), with whom Gittes used to work as an officer in Chinatown. Escobar and his men are investigating Mulwray's death by drowning and are recovering the body. At headquarters, Evelyn falsely tells Escobar that she did hire Gittes at the outset to put an end to rumors about Mulwray's adultery, expecting nothing to come of it. Gittes tells Evelyn that he suspects that Mulwray was murdered. Evelyn hires Gittes to investigate Mulwray's death.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breaking into the reservoir's secured area that night, Gittes nearly drowns in water suddenly being dumped. Soaking wet, he is confronted by water department security chief Claude Mulvihill (a corrupt former county sheriff) with a short henchman (a cameo by director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski" title="Roman Polanski">Roman Polanski</a>) who sticks a knife blade up Gittes's nose and slashes through his nostril for being a "very nosy kitty cat." Back at his office, sporting a bandage, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, identifying herself as the "working girl" who pretended to "hire" him as Mrs. Mulwray. She did not realize the seriousness of what she was involved in, she explains, but she is too afraid to identify her employer. Miss Sessions does provide a clue, though: that Gittes can find the name of one of "those people" in that day's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obituary" title="Obituary">obituary</a> column.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gittes visits the hall of records, comparing recent land grantees with names of deceased persons in the obituary column. Then he drives to an orange grove in the northwest <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley" title="San Fernando Valley">San Fernando Valley</a>, and is shot at, caught, and beaten by the angry landowners. They explain that the water department has been demolishing their water tanks and poisoning wells, before they knock him out. When Gittes wakes up, Evelyn is there to pick him up. They leave and Gittes reviews the obituary column, noticing that a resident of the Mar Vista Inn, a retirement home, died <i>two</i> weeks ago, but "bought" acreage in the Valley only <i>one</i> week ago. "That's unusual," Gittes quips. Growers have been forced off their acreage by drought conditions and harassment by the water department, Gittes explains, depressing value. Unidentified persons are buying tens of thousands of acres "for peanuts" using the names of straw buyers. The public dam bond issue that Mulwray unsuccessfully opposed, Gittes explains, is a "con job" designed to irrigate the rural valley, not to conserve water for city taxpayers. Because he knew about this and other things, Gittes theorizes, Hollis Mulwray was murdered. Evelyn and Jake arrive at the Mar Vista Inn and confirm that its residents have no clue of their wealth; further, the Mar Vista Inn is affiliated with the Albacore Club as "sort of an unofficial charity." Mulvihill soon arrives to "escort" Jake out and they scuffle.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With Mulvihill's henchman firing at them, Gittes and Evelyn escape the Mar Vista in her car. Returning to her house, they passionately kiss and wind up in her bed. In intimate conversation, Jake tells Evelyn about his time as a beat cop in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="Chinatown, Los Angeles, California">L.A.'s Chinatown</a>, where he was instructed to do "as little as possible." Nothing was ever as it seemed, he explains. Gittes's attempt to protect a woman only ensured that she was hurt. Evelyn's phone rings and she quickly hangs up and says that she has to leave. Evelyn asks Jake to wait for her there and to trust her. She adds that Noah Cross owns the Albacore Club.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gittes tails Evelyn to her butler's house; peering through a bedroom window he sees Evelyn comforting Katherine, Mulwray's distraught mistress. Evelyn, when Gittes presses, admits that Mulwray's mistress is her sister. Then Ida Sessions is found murdered in her house. Gittes receives a mysterious call from a homicide detective using Ms. Sessions's phone and arrives there. Escobar explains that the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner" title="Coroner">coroner</a> found salt water in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that the body was moved, as it was recovered from a freshwater <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir" title="Reservoir">reservoir</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gittes returns to Evelyn's mansion, where he discovers a pair of men's eyeglasses in her salt water garden pond. Presuming that Evelyn killed Mulwray and that the glasses had been his, Gittes confronts Evelyn. She denies guilt and, under questioning, wavers about whether Katherine is her sister, or her daughter. In a climactic scene, Gittes repeatedly slaps Evelyn on one side of the face, and then the other, until Evelyn cries out "She's my sister <i>and</i> my daughter!" whom she bore to Noah Cross when she was 15. Evelyn says that the found eyeglasses could not have been Mulwray's because they are <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifocals" title="Bifocals">bifocals</a>. Gittes decides to help Evelyn and Katherine escape from Cross and Escobar, who now suspects Evelyn of Mulwray's murder, and accuses Gittes of extortion and of acting as an accessory. Gittes arranges for the two women to flee to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, through a fisherman client of his, and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="Chinatown, Los Angeles, California">Chinatown</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Mulwray's home, Gittes arranges for Mr. Cross to meet him, claiming that he's found Mulwray's mistress. After Gittes confronts him, Cross admits he intends to incorporate the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, which will be irrigated and developed. Gittes then broaches the topic of Cross's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest" title="Incest">incest</a> with Evelyn, and accuses him of Mulwray's drowning. Cross says most people never have to acknowledge that, given the right circumstances, they are "capable of anything." Gittes produces Cross's bifocals, the only physical evidence linking him to Mulwray's murder. Mulvihill appears, holding a gun on Gittes, forcing him to surrender Cross's glasses and to take them to Katherine. When Gittes reaches the hiding place in Chinatown, the police are already there and arrest Gittes for withholding evidence and extortion. Gittes protests that Cross murdered Mulwray, but Escobar orders one of his men to handcuff Gittes to a car.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Noah Cross approaches Katherine, explaining that he is her "grandfather." Evelyn backs him off with a small pistol, vowing to protect her daughter. Gittes scolds Evelyn to "Let the police handle this!" Evelyn fires back: "He <i>owns</i> the police!" Cross approaches Katherine again and Evelyn shoots him in the arm. As Evelyn speeds away with Katherine, the police open fire, killing Evelyn; her body falls onto the car horn, followed by Katherine's blood-curdling scream. Cross clutches Katherine and takes her away.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1971, producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Evans_(producer)" title="Robert Evans (producer)">Robert Evans</a> originally offered Towne $175,000 to write a screenplay for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby_(1974_film)" title="The Great Gatsby (1974 film)">The Great Gatsby</a></i> (1974), but Towne felt he couldn't better the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald" title="F. Scott Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby" title="The Great Gatsby">novel</a>. Instead, Towne asked for $25,000 from Evans to write his own story, <i>Chinatown</i>, to which Evans agreed.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Chinatown</i> is set in 1937 and portrays the manipulation of a critical municipal resource â€” water â€” by a cadre of shadowy oligarchs. It was the first part of Towne's planned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy" title="Trilogy">trilogy</a> about the character J.J. Gittes, the foibles of the Los Angeles power structure, and the subjugation of public good by private greed. The second part, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Jakes" title="The Two Jakes">The Two Jakes</a></i>, was about another grab for a natural resource â€” oil â€” with a thicker-torsoed Gittes in the 1940s. It was directed by Jack Nicholson and released in 1990, but the second film's commercial and critical failure scuttled plans to make <i>Gittes vs. Gittes</i>, about the third finite resource â€” land â€” in Los Angeles, circa 1968.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The characters Hollis Mulwray and Noah Cross are both references to the chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Mulholland" title="William Mulholland">William Mulholland</a> (1855â€“1935) â€” the name Hollis Mulwray is partially an anagram for Mulholland. The name Noah is a reference to a flood â€” to suggest the conflict between good and evil in Mulholland. Mulholland was the designer and engineer for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Aqueduct" title="Los Angeles Aqueduct">Los Angeles Aqueduct</a>, which brought water from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles. For reasons of engineering and safety, Mulwray opposes the dam that Cross and the city want to build. Mulwray says he will not make the same mistake as when he built a previous dam, which broke, resulting in the deaths of hundreds. This is a direct reference to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Francis_Dam" title="St. Francis Dam">St. Francis Dam</a> disaster. The dam was personally inspected by Mulholland himself before it catastrophically failed the next morning on March 12, 1928. More than 450 people, 42 of them schoolchildren, died that day and the town of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Paula" title="Santa Paula">Santa Paula</a> was inundated with flood water. The incident effectively ended Mulholland's career and he died in 1935. Margaret Leslie Davis, in her 1993 book <i>Rivers in the Desert: William Mulholland and the Inventing of Los Angeles</i>, says the sexually charged film is a metaphor for the "rape" of the Owens Valley. She notes that it fictionalizes Mulholland into a corrupt and sinister character while underplaying the strong public support for Southern California's controversial water projects.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robert Towne says he took the title, and the famous exchange, "What did you do in Chinatown?" / "As little as possible", from a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary" title="Hungary">Hungarian</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_cop" title="Vice cop">vice cop</a> who had worked in Chinatown. The cop explained to Towne that the complicated array of dialects and gangs in Los Angeles's Chinatown made it impossible for the police to know whether their interventions in Chinatown were helping victims or furthering their exploitation by criminals. As a consequence, the police decided the best course of action was to do as little as possible.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polanski found out about the script through Nicholson, with whom he had been planning to make a film once they found the right property. Producer Robert Evans wanted Polanski to direct as well, because he wanted a European vision of the United States, which he thought would be darker and more cynical. Polanski, just a few years removed from the murder of his wife in Los Angeles, was initially reluctant to return, but was persuaded to accept the project based on the strength of the script.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Towne wrote the screenplay with Nicholson in mind. Evans, the producer, intended the screenplay to have a happy ending with Cross dying and Evelyn Mulwray surviving. Evans and Polanski argued over it, with Polanski insisting on a tragic end. The two parted ways due to the dispute and Polanski wrote the final scene just a few days before it was shot.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polanski originally offered the cinematographer position to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_A._Fraker" title="William A. Fraker">William A. Fraker</a>, Paramount agreed and Fraker accepted. Paramount had previously hired Fraker to shoot for Polanski on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary%27s_Baby_(film)" title="Rosemary's Baby (film)">Rosemary's Baby</a></i>. When Robert Evans became aware of the hiring he insisted the offer be rescinded. Evans, who had also produced <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, felt pairing Polanski and Fraker created a team with too much power on one side, and would thus complicate the production.</p>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>"J.J. Gittes" was named after Nicholson's friend, producer Harry Gittes.</li>
	<li>"Evelyn Mulwray" is, according to the screenwriter Towne, intended to initially seem to be the classic "black widow" character typical of lead female characters in film noir, yet is eventually revealed to be the only selfless character in the film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda" title="Jane Fonda">Jane Fonda</a> was strongly considered for the role, but Polanski pushed for Dunaway.</li>
	<li>"Noah Cross": Towne says that Huston was, after Nicholson, the second best-cast actor in the film, and that he made the Cross character evil through his charming and courtly performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polanski appears in a cameo as the gangster who cuts Gittes' nose. The effect was accomplished with a special knife, which could have actually cut Nicholson's nose if Polanski had not held it correctly. In keeping with the tradition Polanski credits to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Chandler" title="Raymond Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a>, all of the events of the film are seen subjectively through Gittes's eyes; for example, when Gittes is knocked unconscious, the film fades to black and then fades back in when he awakens. Gittes appears in every scene of the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phillip Lambro was originally hired to write the film's music score, but it was rejected at the last minute by producer Robert Evans, leaving <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Goldsmith" title="Jerry Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> only 10 days to write and record a new one. Parts of the original Lambro score can be heard in the original trailer for the movie. The haunting trumpet solos were performed by Hollywood studio musician and MGM first trumpet <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uan_Rasey" title="Uan Rasey">Uan Rasey</a>. Goldsmith received an Academy Award nomination for his efforts. Terry Teachout of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>  published an article 7/11/09 praising Jerry Goldsmith's music for the movie, crediting the success of the movie to the revised score.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evans says that the film cemented Jack Nicholson, then a rising star, as one of Hollywood's top leading men.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robert Towne's screenplay for the film has become legendary among critics and filmmakers, often celebrated as one of the best ever written.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Chinatown</i> brought more public awareness to the land dealings and disputes over water rights which arose whilst drawing Los Angeles' water supply from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owens_Valley" title="Owens Valley">Owens Valley</a> in the 1930s.</p>
