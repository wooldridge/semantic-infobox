      <wiki:abstract>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Katharine Houghton Hepburn</b> (May 12, 1907Â â€“ June 29, 2003) was an American actress of film, stage, and television. A film icon, in 1999, she was ranked by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Stars" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars">greatest female star</a> in the history of American cinema.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Raised in Connecticut by wealthy parents, after graduation, Hepburn turned to acting. Favorable reviews of her work on stage in 1932 brought her to the notice of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. After a few early film successes, including her first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a>, for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Glory_(1933_film)" title="Morning Glory (1933 film)">Morning Glory</a></i>, she endured a string of flops, which led to her being voted "box office poison". Fortunately, she had a great triumph starring in the Broadway play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Story_(play)" title="The Philadelphia Story (play)">The Philadelphia Story</a></i>. She obtained the film rights with the help of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> and sold them to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> on the condition that she reprise her leading role as Tracy Lord. The hit <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Story_(film)" title="The Philadelphia Story (film)">film adaptation</a> revived her flagging career.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the course of her long life, she costarred with such screen legends as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a> (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bringing_Up_Baby" title="Bringing Up Baby">Bringing Up Baby</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_(1938_film)" title="Holiday (1938 film)">Holiday</a></i>, <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_African_Queen_(film)" title="The African Queen (film)">The African Queen</a></i>), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooster_Cogburn_(film)" title="Rooster Cogburn (film)">Rooster Cogburn</a></i>), and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a> (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Golden_Pond_(1981_film)" title="On Golden Pond (1981 film)">On Golden Pond</a></i>). However, her greatest teaming, both on-screen and off, was with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>, beginning with 1942's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_of_the_Year" title="Woman of the Year">Woman of the Year</a></i>. They fell in love and conducted a decades-long affair that was kept secret from the general public. (Tracy was married and, as a Catholic, could not divorce his wife.) The last of their nine films together was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%27s_Coming_to_Dinner" title="Guess Who's Coming to Dinner">Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</a></i> (1967), which was completed shortly before his death.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn holds the record for the most <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Best Actress</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> wins with four, out of 12 nominations.

	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_years">Early years</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut" title="Hartford, Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a>, the daughter of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragette" title="Suffragette">suffragette</a> Katharine Martha <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houghton_family" title="Houghton family">Houghton</a> (1878Â â€“ 1951) (an heiress to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corning_Glass" title="Corning Glass">Corning Glass</a> fortune and co-founder of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood" title="Planned Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a>), and Dr. Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879Â â€“ 1962), who was a successful <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urologist" title="Urologist">urologist</a> from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> roots. Her siblings were Thomas Houghton Hepburn (1905â€“1921), Richard Houghton Hepburn (1911â€“2000), Robert Houghton Hepburn (1913â€“2007), Marion Houghton Hepburn Grant (1918â€“1986) and Margaret Houghton Hepburn Perry (1920â€“2006).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn's father insisted the girls swim, ride, and play golf and tennis. Hepburn won a bronze medal for figure skating from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> skating club, shot golf in the low eighties and reached the semi final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship. Hepburn especially enjoyed swimming, and regularly took dips in the frigid waters that fronted her bayfront <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> home, generally believing that "the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you." She continued her brisk swims well into her 80s. Hepburn would come to be recognized for her athletic physicality; she fearlessly performed her own pratfalls in films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bringing_Up_Baby" title="Bringing Up Baby">Bringing Up Baby</a></i> (1938).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On April 3, 1921, while visiting friends in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a>, Hepburn found her older brother Tom (born November 8, 1905), whom she idolized, hanging from the rafters of the attic by a rope, an apparent suicide. Her family denied it was self-inflicted, arguing he had been a happy boy. They insisted it must have been an experiment gone awry. It has been speculated he was trying to carry out a trick he saw in a play with Katharine. Hepburn was devastated and sank into a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression" title="Clinical depression">depression</a>. She shied away from other children and was mostly home-schooled. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, <i>Me: Stories of My Life</i>, that Hepburn revealed her true birth date of May 12, 1907.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn was educated at the Oxford School (now <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingswood-Oxford_School" title="Kingswood-Oxford School">Kingswood-Oxford School</a>) in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Hartford,_Connecticut" title="West Hartford, Connecticut">West Hartford, Connecticut</a>, before going on to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryn_Mawr_College" title="Bryn Mawr College">Bryn Mawr College</a>. Hepburn was suspended for breaking curfew and smoking, which at that time was particularly not encouraged for women. Decades later, Hepburn also confirmed that after dark, she would go <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinny-dipping" title="Skinny-dipping">swimming naked</a> in the college's "Cloisters" fountain. She received a degree in history and philosophy in 1928, the same year she had her debut on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> after landing a bit part in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Hostess" title="Night Hostess">Night Hostess</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A banner year for Hepburn, 1928 also marked her marriage to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialite" title="Socialite">socialite</a> businessman <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Ogden_Smith" title="Ludlow Ogden Smith">Ludlow ("Luddy") Ogden Smith</a>, whom she had met while at Bryn Mawr and married after a short engagement. Hepburn and Smith's marriage was turbulent, and they spent less and less time living together as Hepburn pursued her career on the stage and traveled. They were divorced in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> in 1934. Fearing that the Mexican divorce was not legal, Ludlow obtained a second divorce in the United States in 1942 and a few days later he remarried. Katharine Hepburn often expressed her gratitude toward Ludlow for his financial and moral support in the early days of her career. "Luddy" continued to be a lifelong friend to her and the Hepburn family.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On September 21, 1938, Hepburn was staying in her family's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Saybrook,_Connecticut" title="Old Saybrook, Connecticut">Old Saybrook, Connecticut</a> beach home when the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_New_England_Hurricane" title="1938 New England Hurricane">1938 New England Hurricane</a> struck and destroyed the house. Hepburn, her mother, brother and servants narrowly escaped before the home was lifted off its foundations and washed away. She stated in her 1991 book entitled <i>Me</i> that she lost 95% of her belongings in the storm, including her 1932â€“1933 best actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a>, which was later found intact.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn developed her acting skills during her time at Bryn Mawr. There, Hepburn met Eddie Knopf, a young producer with a stock company in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore,_Maryland" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, who cast her in several small roles, including a production of <i>The Czarina</i> and <i>The Cradle Snatchers</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her first leading role was in a production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Pond" title="The Big Pond">The Big Pond</a></i>, which opened in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Neck,_New_York" title="Great Neck, New York">Great Neck, New York</a>. The producer dismissed the original actress at the last moment, and substituted Hepburn. Terror stricken, Hepburn arrived late and stumbled over her lines, tripped over her feet and spoke so fast she was almost incomprehensible. She was also dismissed, but continued to understudy and gain small stock company roles.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn was cast in the Broadway play <i>Art and Mrs. Bottle</i>. Hepburn was dismissed from this role too, although she was later rehired when the director could not find a replacement. After another summer of stock companies, in 1932, Hepburn landed the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiope_(mythology)" title="Antiope (mythology)">Antiope</a> the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons" title="Amazons">Amazon</a> princess in <i>The Warrior's Husband</i> (an update of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata" title="Lysistrata">Lysistrata</a></i>), which required her to wear a very short costume, and received excellent reviews. Hepburn became the talk of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and was noticed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the play, Hepburn entered the stage by jumping down a flight of steps while carrying a large stag on her shouldersÂ â€” an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO" title="RKO">RKO</a> scout (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Hayward" title="Leland Hayward">Leland Hayward</a>, whom she would later romance) was so impressed by this display of physicality that he asked her to do a screen test for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bill_of_Divorcement" title="A Bill of Divorcement">A Bill of Divorcement</a></i>, which starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barrymore" title="John Barrymore">John Barrymore</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Manners" title="David Manners">David Manners</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Burke" title="Billie Burke">Billie Burke</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She demanded $1,500 per week for film work (at the time she was earning between $80 and $100 per week), assuming RKO would refuse. To her surprise, after seeing her screen test, RKO agreed to her demands and cast her. At 5 feet, 7Â inches (1.71 m), Hepburn was one of the tallest leading ladies of the day. The director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cukor" title="George Cukor">George Cukor</a> became a lifetime friend and colleague. Barrymore pinched her posterior on the set in one of many attempts to seduce her. She said, "If you do that again I'm going to stop acting." Barrymore replied, "I wasn't aware that you'd started, my dear."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the positive audience reaction to <i>A Bill of Divorcement</i>, RKO signed Hepburn to a new contract. But her non-conformist, anti-Hollywood behavior off screen made studio executives fret she would never become a major star. The following year (1933), Hepburn won her first Oscar in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Glory_(1933_film)" title="Morning Glory (1933 film)">Morning Glory</a></i>, as a young actress who rejects romance in favor of her career. That same year, Hepburn played Jo in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women_(1933_film)" title="Little Women (1933 film)">screen adaptation</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women" title="Little Women">Little Women</a></i>, which broke box-office records, and for which she won the Best Actress award at the Venice Film Festival.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intoxicated by her success, Hepburn wanted to return to the theater. She chose <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lake" title="The Lake">The Lake</a></i>, but RKO would not release her and she made the forgettable <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitfire_(1934_film)" title="Spitfire (1934 film)">Spitfire</a></i>. Having satisfied RKO, Hepburn went immediately back to Manhattan to begin the play, in which she played an English girl unhappy with her overbearing mother and weak father. The play was generally considered a flop, and Hepburn's performance elicited <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Parker" title="Dorothy Parker">Dorothy Parker</a>'s quip that the actress "ran the gamut of emotions from A to B."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1935, in the title role of the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Adams_(film)" title="Alice Adams (film)">Alice Adams</a></i>, Hepburn earned her second Oscar nomination. By 1938, Hepburn was an established star, and her forays into comedy with the films <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bringing_Up_Baby" title="Bringing Up Baby">Bringing Up Baby</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_Door" title="Stage Door">Stage Door</a></i> were well-received critically. But audience response to the two films was tepid, and the good reviews from the critics were not enough to rescue her from an earlier string of flops (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Minister" title="The Little Minister">The Little Minister</a></i>, <i>Spitfire</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_of_Hearts" title="Break of Hearts">Break of Hearts</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Scarlett" title="Sylvia Scarlett">Sylvia Scarlett</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Woman_Rebels" title="A Woman Rebels">A Woman Rebels</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Scotland_(film)" title="Mary of Scotland (film)">Mary of Scotland</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_Street_(1937_film)" title="Quality Street (1937 film)">Quality Street</a></i>). As a result, Hepburn's movie career began to decline.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Katharine Hepburn would often come to interviews dressed in men's suits, saying that it was "comfortable". Without meaning to, she made a fashion statement, and women who admired her started wearing trousers, which was not encouraged at the time.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of what has made Hepburn greatly beloved today â€” her unconventional, straightforward, anti-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> attitude â€” at the time began to turn audiences sour. Outspoken and intellectual with an acerbic tongue, she defied the era's conventions, preferring to wear pantsuits and disdaining makeup. She also had a famously difficult relationship with the press, turning down most interviews, which did not help her image with the public. On her first outing with the Hollywood press corps after the success of <i>A Bill of Divorcement</i>, Hepburn talked with reporters who had invaded her and her husband's cabin aboard the ship <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_City_of_Paris_(1922)" title="SS City of Paris (1922)">City of Paris</a></i>. A reporter asked if they were really married; Hepburn responded, "I don't remember." Following up, another reporter asked if they had any children; Hepburn's answer: "Two white and three colored". Hepburn's aversion to media attention did not thaw until 1973, when she appeared on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dick_Cavett_Show" title="The Dick Cavett Show">The Dick Cavett Show</a></i> for an extended two-day interview.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn could also be prickly with fans; though she relented as she aged, early in her career Hepburn often denied requests for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autograph" title="Autograph">autographs</a>. However, on movie sets, she was eager to learn the ways of the stage and camera crews and befriended many of them. Even so, her refusal to sign autographs and answer personal questions earned her the nickname "Katharine of Arrogance" (an allusion to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>). Soon, audiences began to stay away from her movies.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn was affected by a series of flops when, in 1938, sheÂ â€” along with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Astaire" title="Fred Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_West" title="Mae West">Mae West</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_del_R%C3%ADo" title="Dolores del RÃ­o">Dolores del RÃ­o</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich" title="Marlene Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a>, and othersÂ â€” was voted "box office poison" in a poll taken by exhibitors. In 1939, Hepburn was going to do producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David O. Selznick</a> a favor and play the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_O%27Hara" title="Scarlett O'Hara">Scarlett O'Hara</a> because he did not yet have anyone else signed for the role. Hepburn insisted that she did not have the lustful sex appeal that the part demanded and told Selznick that his studio needed to find the woman who did. Hepburn rehearsed the lines thoroughly just in case. The night before the deadline, Selznick finally cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>. Unknown to Hepburn and the rest of Hollywood, Leigh was long favored for the role, but as an English actress, she was deemed unsuitable. Her affair with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, while he was in the middle of a divorce, made her a controversial choice. The vast "search for Scarlett" was orchestrated to make it seem as if no other actress could be found, thus limiting the shock of Vivien Leigh landing the role. Hepburn was later the maid of honor at Leigh and Olivier's wedding in 1940. Hepburn remained a close friend of Vivien Leigh until Leigh's death in 1967.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn yearned for a comeback on the stage. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Barry" title="Philip Barry">Philip Barry</a> wrote a play especially for her, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Story_(film)" title="The Philadelphia Story (film)">The Philadelphia Story</a></i>, a year after she had starred in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_(1938_film)" title="Holiday (1938 film)">the film version</a> of his play <i>Holiday</i>.

The documentary <i>Cary GrantÂ â€” A Class Apart</i> states that Hepburn was allowed the choice for her final male lead once Gable was unavailable, and that, with $100,000 to use, Katharine chose her friend and favorite costar, Cary Grant. She was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> for her work and won the New York Film Critics award. Her career was revived almost overnight.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn made her first appearance with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_of_the_Year" title="Woman of the Year">Woman of the Year</a></i> (1942), directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stevens" title="George Stevens">George Stevens</a>. Behind the scenes the pair fell in love, beginning what would become one of Hollywood's most famous romances, despite Tracy's life long unwillingness (he was a Catholic) to divorce his estranged wife, the former <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Treadwell" title="Louise Treadwell">Louise Treadwell</a>, whom he had married in 1923.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn and Tracy became one of Hollywood's most recognizable couples. Hepburn, with her agile mind and distinctive New England accent, complemented Tracy's working-class machismo. When <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Mankiewicz" title="Joseph Mankiewicz">Joseph Mankiewicz</a> introduced them, Hepburn, who was wearing special heels that added several inches to her slender frame, said, "I'm afraid I'm too tall for you, Mr. Tracy." Mankiewicz retorted, "Don't worry, he'll soon cut you down to size." As <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> observed in Hepburn's obituary, "Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were at their most seductive when their verbal fencing was sharpest: it was hard to say whether they delighted more in the battle or in each other."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of their films stress the difficulties that couples can have when they try to find an equable balance of power. The sparring over power and control is almost always resolved in an agreement to share. They appeared in nine movies together, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeper_of_the_Flame_(film)" title="Keeper of the Flame (film)">Keeper of the Flame</a></i> (1942), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_Rib" title="Adam's Rib">Adam's Rib</a></i> (1949), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_and_Mike" title="Pat and Mike">Pat and Mike</a></i> (1952), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desk_Set" title="Desk Set">Desk Set</a></i> (1957) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%27s_Coming_to_Dinner" title="Guess Who's Coming to Dinner">Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</a></i> (1967), for which Hepburn won her second Academy Award for Best Actress.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn and Tracy carefully hid their affair from the public, using back entrances to studios and hotels and assiduously avoiding the press. They were undeniably a couple for decades, but did not live together regularly until the last few years of Tracy's life. Even then, they maintained separate homes to keep up appearances. Their relationship, which neither would discuss publicly, lasted until Tracy's death in 1967. Their relationship was complex and there were periods during which they were estranged. Tracy had several affairs while estranged from Hepburn, notably while filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Adventure" title="Plymouth Adventure">Plymouth Adventure</a></i> with his co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Tierney" title="Gene Tierney">Gene Tierney</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn had had several prior liaisons, most notably with her agent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Hayward" title="Leland Hayward">Leland Hayward</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>. Tracy, however, seems to have been her true love. Hepburn took five years off after <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Day%27s_Journey_Into_Night_(1962_film)" title="Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962 film)">Long Day's Journey Into Night</a></i> to care for Tracy while he was in failing health. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, Hepburn did not attend his funeral. She described herself as too heartbroken to ever watch <i>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</i>, saying it evoked memories of Tracy that were too painful.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of Hepburn's Academy Award nominated performances was her role as Rose Sayer in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_African_Queen_(film)" title="The African Queen (film)">The African Queen</a></i> (1951), where she played a prim <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinster" title="Spinster">spinster</a> missionary in Africa (around the time of World War I), who convinces <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a>'s character, a hard-drinking riverboat captain, to use his boat to destroy a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> ship.

Hepburn, ever the urologist's daughter, disapproved of the two men's drinking and piously drank gallons of water each day to spite them. She wound up so sick with dysentery that, even months after she returned home, the famously vigorous actress was still ill. The trip and the movie made such an impact on her that later in life she wrote a book about filming the movie: <i>The Making of The African Queen: Or, How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind</i>, which made her a best-selling author at the age of 77.</p>
