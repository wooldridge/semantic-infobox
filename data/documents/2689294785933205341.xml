He is found and imprisoned on a troop carrier by his company <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sergeant" title="First Sergeant">First Sergeant</a>, Welsh (Penn). In Welsh's conversation with Witt, it is clear that the private is unenthusiastic about serving in the army.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The men of C Company have been brought to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalcanal" title="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> as reinforcements in the campaign to seize the island from the Japanese. As they wait in the holds of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy" title="Navy">Navy</a> transport, they contemplate their lives and the impending invasion. On deck, battalion commander <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Tall (Nolte) talks with his commanding officer, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier_General" title="Brigadier General">Brigadier General</a> Quintard (Travolta), about the invasion and its importance. Tall's voice-over reveals that he has been passed over for promotion and this battle may be his last chance to command a victorious operation.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C Company lands on Guadalcanal unopposed and hikes to the interior of the island, encountering little evidence of a Japanese presence at all. They arrive near Hill 210, a key <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japanese</a> position. The Japanese have placed a bunker housing several machine guns at the top of the hill, giving them full view of the valley below. Any force attempting to climb the hill can be easily cut down by machine-gun fire and mortar rounds.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A brief shelling of the hill begins the next day at dawn. Shortly after, C Company attempts to take the hill and are repulsed by gunfire from the bunker. Among the first killed in the battle is the leader of the attacking platoon, Second Lieutenant Whyte (Leto). During the battle, Colonel Tall orders the company commander, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States)#U.S._Army.2C_U.S._Air_Force.2C_and_U.S._Marine_Corps" title="Captain (United States)">Captain</a> Staros (Koteas) to take the bunker by frontal assault, whatever the cost. Staros refuses, unwilling to treat his men as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_fodder" title="Cannon fodder">cannon fodder</a>. When the two reach a stalemate, Tall decides to join Staros on the front line to see the situation for himself. By the time he arrives, the Japanese resistance seems to have lessened, and Tall's opinion of Staros seems to have been sealed. Also, during the battle, Private Witt, having been assigned punitively as a stretcher bearer, asks to rejoin the company, and is permitted to do so.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A long stretch of the story then centers on the personal lives and moral views of the men. Staros is relieved of his command for disobeying Tall's orders. Tall sarcastically proposes recommending Staros for several decorations but nevertheless promises to recommend Staros for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Advocate_General%27s_Corps" title="Judge Advocate General's Corps">JAG</a> duty in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> â€” he does not want the unit's name to be stained by the fact of having an officer removed from command. Elsewhere, Private Bell receives a letter from his wife asking him for a divorce. Witt leaves the company to find another native village, only to find that his sense of peace in such places has been shaken, as he sees that even here there is horror and evil. He returns to the company before his departure has been noted. A conversation involving First Sergeant Welsh and Witt follows, revealing that Welsh is unhappy around other people. The scene highlights Witt's devotion to the spark of light and glory he sees in people, even in death.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unit is sent out on another mission further into the interior of the island. Witt and two other men, Corporal Fife (Brody) and Private Coombs, are sent out but find that their unit is heavily outnumbered and must retreat; however, getting word back to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant" title="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> Band (Gleeson), who has replaced Staros as company commander, will be difficult since they are surrounded. Witt decides to act as a decoy and lure the Japanese away from his two companions and the rest of their unit. He succeeds in drawing the Japanese away, but in the course of retreating, is surrounded when he runs into a small clearing. One Japanese soldier advances toward Witt and implores him to drop his weapon. The Japanese soldier says that he does not wish to kill Witt if he does not have to. Witt's face assumes a blissful expression, reminiscent of his opening narration describing his mother's peaceful acceptance of her death and his desire to meet his own death with the same calm. He then raises his rifle and is instantly shot. The unit later finds his body and buries it on the island. The film ends with another new commanding officer (Clooney) taking over C Company and giving a naÃ¯vely optimistic speech on what his command should be, and the campaign coming to a close with the unit boarding transport ships to leave the island.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>â€“based producer Bobby Geisler first approached Malick in 1978 and asked him to direct a film adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rabe" title="David Rabe">David Rabe's</a> play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Boom_Boom_Room" title="In the Boom Boom Room">In the Boom Boom Room</a></i>. Malick declined the offer, but instead discused the idea of a film about the life of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Merrick" title="Joseph Merrick">Joseph Merrick</a>, but once word got out about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch" title="David Lynch">David Lynch</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_Man_(film)" title="The Elephant Man (film)">The Elephant Man</a></i>, he shelved the idea. In 1988, Geisler and John Roberdeau met with Malick in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> about writing and directing a movie based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._M._Thomas" title="D. M. Thomas">D. M. Thomas</a>' 1981 novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Hotel" title="The White Hotel">The White Hotel</a></i>. Malick declined, but told them that he would instead be willing to write either an adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moli%C3%A8re" title="MoliÃ¨re">MoliÃ¨re</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartuffe" title="Tartuffe">Tartuffe</a></i>, or of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jones" title="James Jones">James Jones</a>' <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thin_Red_Line_(1962_novel)" title="The Thin Red Line (1962 novel)">The Thin Red Line</a></i>. The producers chose the latter and paid Malick $250,000 to write a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay" title="Screenplay">screenplay</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Malick began adapting <i>The Thin Red Line</i> on January 1, 1989. Five months later, the producers received his first draft that was 300 pages long. According to an article in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>, they gained the director's confidence by "catering to his every whim," providing him with obscure research material, including a book titled <i>Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia</i>, an audiotape of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodo_(taiko_group)" title="Kodo (taiko group)">Kodo</a>: Heartbeat Drummers of Japan</i>, information on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_people" title="Navajo people">Navajo</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_talkers" title="Code talkers">code talkers</a> enlisted by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> to communicate in their native <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_language" title="Navajo language">Navajo language</a> in case Japanese troops intercepted radio transmissions, making his travel plans and helping the director and his wife Michele get a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan" title="Mortgage loan">mortgage</a> for their Paris apartment.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The producers spent a lot of time talking with Malick about his vision of the film. Geisler said, "Malick's Guadalcanal would be a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost" title="Paradise Lost">Paradise Lost</a>, an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden" title="Garden of Eden">Eden</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape" title="Rape">raped</a> by the green poison, as Terry used to call it, of war. Much of the violence was to be portrayed indirectly. A soldier is shot, but rather than showing a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Spielbergian</a> bloody face we see a tree explode, the shredded vegetation, and a gorgeous bird with a broken wing flying out of a tree". Malick spent years working on other projects, including a stage production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansho_the_Bailiff" title="Sansho the Bailiff">Sansho the Bailiff</a></i> and a script known as <i>The English-Speaker</i>, spending $2 million of the producers' money, half of which for writing. In 1990, he met with James Jones' daughter Kaylie and his widow Gloria about adapting <i>The Thin Red Line</i> into a film. By January 1995, Geisler and Roberdeau were broke and pressured Malick to decide which one he would complete. They approached Malick's former agent, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Medavoy" title="Mike Medavoy">Mike Medavoy</a>, who was setting up his own production company, Phoenix Pictures, and he agreed to give them $100,000 to start work on <i>The Thin Red Line</i>. Medavoy had a deal with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures" title="Sony Pictures">Sony Pictures</a> and Malick began scouting locations in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a> before settling on the rain forests of northern <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>. In April 1997, three months before filming, Sony pulled the plug while crews were building the sets in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> because new studio chairman <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calley" title="John Calley">John Calley</a> did not think Malick could make his movie with the proposed $52 million budget. Malick traveled to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> with Medavoy to pitch the project to various studios. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> agreed to put up $39 million of the budget with the stipulation that Malick cast five movie stars from a list of 10 who were interested. Pioneer Films, a Japanese company, contributed $8 million to the budget, and Phoenix added a further $3 million.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Sean Penn met Malick, he told him, "Give me a dollar and tell me where to show up". Scripts were also sent to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duvall" title="Robert Duvall">Robert Duvall</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>. In 1995, once word went out that Malick was making another movie after many years, numerous actors approached him. At Medavoy's home in 1995, he staged a reading with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sheen" title="Martin Sheen">Martin Sheen</a> delivering the screen directions, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner" title="Kevin Costner">Kevin Costner</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Patton" title="Will Patton">Will Patton</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Berg" title="Peter Berg">Peter Berg</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukas_Haas" title="Lukas Haas">Lukas Haas</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermot_Mulroney" title="Dermot Mulroney">Dermot Mulroney</a> playing the main roles. In June of that year, a five-day workshop was scheduled at Medavoy's with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt" title="Brad Pitt">Brad Pitt</a> dropping by and culminating with Malick putting on the soundtrack of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Eagles_Dare" title="Where Eagles Dare">Where Eagles Dare</a></i> and playing Japanese Kodo drums. Malick even met with an interested <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp" title="Johnny Depp">Johnny Depp</a> at the Book Soup Bistro on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Strip" title="Sunset Strip">Sunset Strip</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton" title="Edward Norton">Edward Norton</a> flew out to Austin and met Malick, who had been impressed by the actor's screen test for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primal_Fear_(film)" title="Primal Fear (film)">Primal Fear</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey" title="Matthew McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a> reportedly took a day off filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Time_to_Kill" title="A Time to Kill">A Time to Kill</a></i> to see Malick.

Malick told <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Sizemore" title="Tom Sizemore">Tom Sizemore</a> that he wanted him for a role in his film and the actor agreed. Sizemore, however, was offered a more substantial role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" title="Saving Private Ryan">Saving Private Ryan</a></i> and, when he could not contact Malick for several days, decided to do <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s film instead.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To appease the studio, Malick cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney" title="George Clooney">George Clooney</a> in a small role. Geisler remembers, "Terry was worried that having a big star like Clooney play a character who enters the film near the end would be distracting". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caviezel" title="James Caviezel">James Caviezel</a>, who was cast as Private Witt, credits Malick's casting of him as the turning point in his career. Cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Toll" title="John Toll">John Toll</a> began talking to Malick in August 1996 several times over the phone about the film. Toll met Malick in September of the same year and was asked to do the film in the beginning of 1997. Malick and Toll began <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_scouting" title="Location scouting">location scouting</a> in February 1997 and started principal photography in June of that year.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pre-production went slowly, as Malick had a hard time making decisions. Weeks before filming began, Malick told Geisler and Roberdeau not to show up in Australia where the film was being made because George Stevens Jr. would be the on-location producer supporting line producer Grant Hill. Malick told them that they had upset the studio for refusing to give up above-the-title production credit to Stevens. He did not tell them, however, that in 1996 he had a clause inserted in his contract barring the producers from the set. Geisler and Roberdeau were mystified about this behavior; Geisler told <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, "I didn't think he was capable of betrayal of this magnitude".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Malick and Toll scouted the actual battlefields on Guadalcanal and shot footage but the logistics were too difficult to shoot the entire film there. <i>The Thin Red Line</i> was filmed predominantly in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daintree_Rainforest" title="Daintree Rainforest">Daintree Rainforest</a> and on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bramston_Beach" title="Bramston Beach">Bramston Beach</a>, both in north <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland,_Australia" title="Queensland, Australia">Queensland, Australia</a>. Filming also took place on Dancer mountain, which had such rough terrain that trailers and production trucks could not make it up the hill. A base camp was set up at its base and roads carved out of the mountain. Transporting 250 actors and 200 crew members up the hill took two hours. Malick's unconventional filming techniques included shooting part of a scene during a bright, sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset. He made a habit of pointing the camera away during an action sequence and focus on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot" title="Parrot">parrot</a>, a tree branch or other fauna. Malick's reputation and working methods commanded great respect among the actors, with both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson" title="Woody Harrelson">Woody Harrelson</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Savage_(actor)" title="John Savage (actor)">John Savage</a> staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work. He shot for 100 days in Australia, 24 in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" title="Solomon Islands">Solomon Islands</a> and three in the United States. The decision not to shoot on the island of Guadalcanal was a practical one: It has a 50% rate of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and it lacked logistical feasibility. As <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_photography" title="Director of photography">director of photography</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Toll" title="John Toll">John Toll</a> said, "It's still a bit difficult to get on and off the island, and we had some scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras. We would have had to bring everybody to Guadalcanal, and financially it just didn't make sense".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the cast seen in the final cut of the film, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bob_Thornton" title="Billy Bob Thornton">Billy Bob Thornton</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sheen" title="Martin Sheen">Martin Sheen</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman" title="Gary Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pullman" title="Bill Pullman">Bill Pullman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukas_Haas" title="Lukas Haas">Lukas Haas</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viggo_Mortensen" title="Viggo Mortensen">Viggo Mortensen</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Rourke" title="Mickey Rourke">Mickey Rourke</a> also performed, but their scenes were eventually cut. Editor Leslie Jones was on location for five months and rarely saw Malick, who left her to her own devices. After principal photography wrapped, she came back with a five-hour first cut and spent seven months editing, with Thornton contributing three hours of narrative voice-over material. It was at this point that editor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Weber" title="Billy Weber">Billy Weber</a> came on board and they spent 13 months in post-production and the last four months mixing the film, using four <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avid_Technology" title="Avid Technology">Avid</a> machines with a fifth added at one point. There were no preview screenings but several in-house ones, the largest of which was attended by 15 people for marketing executives. The editors faced the challenge of blending footage of veteran actors with less-experienced ones, integrating the many cameos, and the voice-overs. According to Jones, "Malick removed scenes with dialogue whenever possible, with the final film varying greatly from the original concept". Four months after principal photography, Malick invited Toll to a rough cut screening of the film. In December 1998, Toll did the first color correction at the lab prior to the film's release in North America.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The editing also resulted in many of the well-known cast members being on screen for only a brief period: for example, John Travolta and George Clooney's appearances are little more than <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance" title="Cameo appearance">cameos</a>, yet Clooney's name appears prominently in the marketing of the movie. The unfinished film was screened for the New York press on December 1998 and Adrien Brody attended a screening to find that his originally significant role, "to carry the movie", as he put it, had been reduced to two lines and approximately five minutes of screen time. On April 15, 2001, an interview with Adrien Brody revealed that he was still upset over the removal of his work. He expressed his opinions in an interview with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> newspaper <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a>:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Malick was upset that the studio screened his unfinished version for critics and Penn ended up helping him in the editing room, shaping the final version. Malick spent three more months and cut 45 additional minutes from the film. The director refused to subject his film to test screenings before delivering his final cut. After Geisler and Roberdeau told their story to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i> magazine, Medavoy's attorneys declared them in breach of contract and threatened to remove their names from the film unless they agreed to do no future interviews until after the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zimmer wrote several hours of music, and an abundance of different themes, even before Malick started to shoot the film. The director then played the music on the set, while filming, to get himself, and the rest of the crew and actors in the right frame of mind. The official soundtrack features tracks that were not used on the film and some tracks from the film are not found on the CD. The film features several pieces of Melanesian choral music sung by the Choir of All Saints in Honiara, only one of which is featured on the soundtrack. However, another soundtrack was released containing several tracks from the Choir, which has since gone out of circulation.</p>

The battle scenes themselves are masterful, in creating a sense of the geography of a particular hill, the way it is defended by Japanese bunkers, the ways in which the American soldiers attempt to take it ... Actors like Sean Penn, John Cusack, Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin find the perfect tone for scenes of a few seconds or a minute, and then are dropped before a rhythm can be established".

Mike Clark of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> gave the film four out of four stars.
