      <wiki:abstract>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Steven Allan Spielberg</b> (born December 18, 1946) is an American film director, screenwriter, film producer, video game designer and studio executive. In a career spanning four decades, Spielberg's films have covered many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as an archetype of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing such issues as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, slavery, war and terrorism. He is considered one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. He is also one of the founders of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks" title="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> movie studio.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Academy Award for Best Director</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i> (1993) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" title="Saving Private Ryan">Saving Private Ryan</a></i> (1998). Three of Spielberg's films; <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i> (1975), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i> (1982), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i> (1993), achieved <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" title="List of highest-grossing films">box office</a> records, each becoming the highest-grossing film made at the time. To date, the unadjusted gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $8.5Â billion worldwide. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes</a> puts Spielberg's wealth at $3.0Â billion.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio, to a Jewish family. His mother Leah Adler was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and father Arnold Spielberg was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. He spent his childhood in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haddon_Heights,_New_Jersey" title="Haddon Heights, New Jersey">Haddon Heights, New Jersey</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsdale,_Arizona" title="Scottsdale, Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>. Throughout his early teens, Spielberg made amateur 8Â mm "adventure" films with his friends, the first of which he shot at the Pinnacle Peak Patio restaurant in Scottsdale. He charged admission (25 cents) to his home films (which involved the wrecks he staged with his Lionel train set) while his sister sold popcorn.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1958, he became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouting_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)">Boy Scout</a>, and fulfilled a requirement for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merit_badge_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)">photography merit badge</a> by making a nine-minute 8Â mm film entitled <i>The Last Gunfight</i>. Spielberg recalled years later to a magazine interviewer, "My dad's still-camera was broken, so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father's movie camera. He said yes, and I got an idea to do a Western. I made it and got my merit badge. That was how it all started." At age 13, Spielberg won a prize for a 40-minute war film he titled <i>Escape to Nowhere</i> which was based on a battle in east Africa. In 1963, at age 16, Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firelight_(1964_film)" title="Firelight (1964 film)">Firelight</a></i> (which would later inspire <i>Close Encounters</i>). The film, which had a budget of US$500, was shown in his local cinema and generated a profit of $100. He also made several WWII films inspired by his father's war stories.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After his parents divorced, he moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga,_California" title="Saratoga, California">Saratoga, California</a> with his father. His three sisters and mother remained in Arizona, where he attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder" title="Passover Seder">Passover Seders</a> at the home of Zalman and Pearl Segal on an annual basis. Although he attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_High_School_(Phoenix,_Arizona)" title="Arcadia High School (Phoenix, Arizona)">Arcadia High School</a> in Phoenix, Arizona for three years, Spielberg ended up graduating from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_High_School" title="Saratoga High School">Saratoga High School</a> in 1965. It was during this time Spielberg attained the rank of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)">Eagle Scout</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg attended synagogue as a young boy in Haddon Heights, NJ, an area which did not allow Jews before World War II. He attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_L._Lewis" title="Albert L. Lewis">Albert L. Lewis</a>, who would later be memorialized as the main character in Mitch Albom's, <i>Have a Little Faith</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a child, Spielberg has faced difficulty assimilating. â€œIt isnâ€™t something I enjoy admitting,â€&#157; he once said, â€œbut when I was 7, 8, 9 years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parentsâ€™ Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times. My grandfather always wore a long black coat, black hat and long white beard. I was embarrassed to invite my friends over to the house, because he might be in a corner davening [praying], and I wouldnâ€™t know how to explain this to my WASP friends.â€&#157; Spielberg also said he suffered from acts of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Semitic" title="Anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> prejudice in his early life: he later said, "In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After moving to California, he applied to attend the film school at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a> School of Theater, Film and Television three separate times, but was unsuccessful. He was a student subsequently of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University,_Long_Beach" title="California State University, Long Beach">California State University, Long Beach</a>. While attending Long Beach State in the 1960s, Spielberg became member of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_Chi_Fraternity" title="Theta Chi Fraternity">Theta Chi Fraternity</a>. His actual career began when he returned to Universal Studios as an unpaid, seven-day-a-week intern and guest of the editing department. After Spielberg became famous, USC awarded him an honorary degree in 1994, and in 1996 he became a trustee of the university. In 2002, thirty-five years after starting college, Spielberg finished his degree via independent projects at CSULB, and was awarded a B.A. in Film Production and Electronic Arts with an option in Film/Video Production.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an intern and guest of Universal Studios, Spielberg made his first short film for theatrical release, the 24 minute film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblin%27" title="Amblin'">Amblin'</a></i> (1968), the title of which Spielberg later took as the name of his production company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblin_Entertainment" title="Amblin Entertainment">Amblin Entertainment</a>. After Sidney Sheinberg, then the vice-president of production for Universal's TV arm, saw the film, Spielberg became the youngest director ever to be signed for a long-term deal with a major Hollywood studio (Universal). He dropped out of Long Beach State in 1969 to take up the television director contract at Universal Studios and began his career as a professional director. In 1969, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> announced that Spielberg would direct his first full length film, <i>Malcolm Winkler</i>, written by Claudia Salter, produced by John Orland, with Frank Price being the executive producer. However, because of the difficulty in casting the key male role, the film was not made. Steven Spielberg attended Brookdale Community College for undergrad.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His first professional TV job came when he was hired to do one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Gallery" title="Night Gallery">Night Gallery</a></i>. The segment, "Eyes," starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a>, and she and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death. The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more "mature" films. After this, and an episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Welby,_M.D." title="Marcus Welby, M.D.">Marcus Welby, M.D.</a></i>, Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Game_(TV_series)" title="The Name of the Game (TV series)">The Name of the Game</a></i> called "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._2017" title="L.A. 2017">L.A. 2017</a>". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on <i>Night Gallery</i> and did some work for shows such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Marshall:_Counselor_at_Law" title="Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law">Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law</a></i> and <i>The Psychiatrist</i> before landing the first series episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo_(TV_series)" title="Columbo (TV series)">Columbo</a></i> (previous episodes were actually TV films).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Matheson" title="Richard Matheson">Richard Matheson</a> adaptation called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel_(1971_film)" title="Duel (1971 film)">Duel</a></i>. The film is about a psychotic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterbilt_281" title="Peterbilt 281">Peterbilt 281</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_truck" title="Tanker truck">tanker truck</a> driver who chases a terrified driver (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Weaver" title="Dennis Weaver">Dennis Weaver</a>) of a small <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Valiant" title="Plymouth Valiant">Plymouth Valiant</a> and tries to run him off the road. <i>Duel</i> was his first feature film and major hit when it was released into theaters. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilys_Powell" title="Dilys Powell">Dilys Powell</a> was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Evil" title="Something Evil">Something Evil</a></i>) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(film)" title="The Exorcist (film)">The Exorcist</a></i>, then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film length pilot of a show called <i>Savage</i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Landau" title="Martin Landau">Martin Landau</a>. Spielberg's debut theatrical feature film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sugarland_Express" title="The Sugarland Express">The Sugarland Express</a></i>, about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> stated that "a major new director is on the horizon." However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studio producers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_D._Zanuck" title="Richard D. Zanuck">Richard D. Zanuck</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brown_(producer)" title="David Brown (producer)">David Brown</a> offered Spielberg the director's chair for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i>, a thriller-horror film based on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Benchley" title="Peter Benchley">Peter Benchley</a> novel about an enormous killer shark. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three <b>Academy Awards</b> (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing $470,653,000 worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as "Jawsmania." <i>Jaws</i> made him a household name, as well as one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, and allowed Spielberg a great deal of autonomy for his future projects. It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss" title="Richard Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rejecting offers to direct <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_2" title="Jaws 2">Jaws 2</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(1976_film)" title="King Kong (1976 film)">King Kong</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(film)" title="Superman (film)">Superman</a></i>, Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object" title="Unidentified flying object">UFOs</a>, which became <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i> (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, <i>Close Encounters</i> was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilmos_Zsigmond" title="Vilmos Zsigmond">Vilmos Zsigmond</a>, and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941_(film)" title="1941 (film)">1941</a></i>, a big-budgeted World War II farce wasn't nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4Â million dollars worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics. It has since become a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film" title="Cult film">cult classic</a> thanks to television showings and home video releases.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg then revisited his <i>Close Encounters</i> project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released <i>Close Encounters: The Special Edition</i> in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, Spielberg teamed with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> creator and friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> on an action adventure film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark" title="Raiders of the Lost Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></i>, the first of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a> (whom Lucas had previously cast in his <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> films as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>). The film was considered a homage to the cliffhanger serials of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Hollywood" title="Golden Age of Hollywood">Golden Age of Hollywood</a>. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). <i>Raiders</i> is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i>. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his people and is trying to get back home. <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> went on to become the top-grossing film of all time. <i>E.T.</i> was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 1982 and 1985, Spielberg produced three high-grossing films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist_(film)" title="Poltergeist (film)">Poltergeist</a></i> (for which he also co-wrote the screenplay), a big-screen adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone:_The_Movie" title="Twilight Zone: The Movie">The Twilight Zone</a></i> (for which he directed the segment "Kick The Can"), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies" title="The Goonies">The Goonies</a></i> (Spielberg, executive producer, also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His next directorial feature was the <i>Raiders</i> sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom" title="Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></i>. Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins" title="Gremlins">Gremlins</a></i> led to the creation of the PG-13 rating due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, <i>Temple of Doom</i> is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg's films often deal with several recurring themes. Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. In an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">AFI</a> interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extra terrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood, and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A strong consistent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)" title="Theme (literature)">theme</a> in his family-friendly work is a childlike, even naÃ¯ve, sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)" title="Hook (film)"><i>Hook</i></a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence" title="A.I. Artificial Intelligence">A.I. Artificial Intelligence</a></i>. According to Warren Buckland, these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (<i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Sun_(film)" title="Empire of the Sun (film)">Empire of the Sun</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i>, etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_(film)" title="Munich (film)">Munich</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" title="Saving Private Ryan">Saving Private Ryan</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminal" title="The Terminal">The Terminal</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)" title="Minority Report (film)">Minority Report</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amistad_(1997_film)" title="Amistad (1997 film)">Amistad</a></i>. If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in <i>Jaws</i> are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In <i>Empire of the Sun</i>, Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can" title="Catch Me If You Can">Catch Me If You Can</a></i> Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in <i>Hook</i> starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of his film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in <i>E.T.</i>, is the most famous example of this theme. In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade" title="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></i>, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son "self reliance," which is not how Indy saw it). Even <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler" title="Oskar Schindler">Oskar Schindler</a>, from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i>, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a></i> depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i> is a committed family man, while John Anderton in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)" title="Minority Report (film)">Minority Report</a></i> is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can" title="Catch Me If You Can">Catch Me If You Can</a></i> (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i> (early in the film another, secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Critics frequently accuse his films of being overly sentimental, though Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised. The influence comes from directors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank Capra</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of casting and production itself, Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films. For instance he has cast Richard Dreyfuss in several films: <i>Jaws</i>, <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>, and <i>Always</i>. Aside from his role as Indiana Jones, Spielberg also cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a> as a headteacher in <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> (though the scene was ultimately cut). Although Spielberg directed him only once (in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for which he voiced many of the animals), veteran voice actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Welker" title="Frank Welker">Frank Welker</a> has lent his voice in a number of productions Spielberg has executively produced from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins" title="Gremlins">Gremlins</a></i> to its sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins_2:_The_New_Batch" title="Gremlins 2: The New Batch">Gremlins 2: The New Batch</a></i>, as well as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_Before_Time" title="The Land Before Time">The Land Before Time</a></i> (and lending his voice to its sequels which Spielberg had no involvement in), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit" title="Who Framed Roger Rabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></i>, and television shows such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Toon_Adventures" title="Tiny Toon Adventures">Tiny Toons</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaniacs" title="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></i>, and SeaQuest DSV. Recently Spielberg has used Tom Hanks on several occasions and has cast him in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, <i>Catch Me If You Can</i>, and <i>The Terminal</i>. Spielberg also has collaborated with Tom Cruise twice on <i>Minority Report</i> and <i>War of the Worlds</i>. Spielberg has also cast Shia LaBeouf in four films: <i>Transformers</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Eye" title="Eagle Eye">Eagle Eye</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull" title="Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Revenge_of_the_Fallen" title="Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></i>. Spielberg prefers working with production members with whom he has developed an existing working relationship.

Most of the DVDs of Spielberg's films have documentaries by Laurent Bouzereau.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A famous example of Spielberg working with the same professionals is his long time collaboration with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a> and the use of his musical scores in all of his films since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sugarland_Express" title="The Sugarland Express">The Sugarland Express</a></i> (except <i>The Color Purple</i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone:_The_Movie" title="Twilight Zone: The Movie">Twilight Zone: The Movie</a></i>). One of Spielberg's trademarks is his use of music by John Williams to add to the visual impact of his scenes and to try and create a lasting picture and sound of the film in the memories of the film audience. These visual scenes often uses images of the sun (e.g. <i>Empire of the Sun</i>, <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, the final scene of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i>, and the end credits of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade" title="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></i> (where they ride into the sunset), of which the last two feature a Williams score at that end scene.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following year, Lucas focused on developing <i>Raiders</i> and the <i>Star Wars</i> sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back" title="Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a></i>, during which <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kasdan" title="Lawrence Kasdan">Lawrence Kasdan</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Marshall_(film_producer)" title="Frank Marshall (film producer)">Frank Marshall</a> joined the project as screenwriter and producer respectively. Between January 23â€“January 27, 1978 for nine hours a day, Lucas, Kasdan, and Spielberg discussed the story and visual ideas. Spielberg came up with Jones being chased by a boulder, which was inspired by "The Seven Cities of Cibola," an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Scrooge" title="Uncle Scrooge">Uncle Scrooge</a> comic by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Barks" title="Carl Barks">Carl Barks</a>. Lucas later acknowledged that the idea for the idol mechanism in the opening scene, and deadly traps later in the film were inspired by several Uncle Scrooge comics. Lucas came up with a submarine, a monkey giving the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_salute" title="Hitler salute">Hitler salute</a>, and Marion punching Jones in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>. Kasdan used a 100-page transcript of their conversations for his first script draft, which he worked on for six months. Ultimately some of their ideas were too grand and had to be cut: a mine chase, an escape in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> using a rolling gong as a shield, and a jump from an airplane in a raft, all of which made it into the prequel, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom" title="Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg and Lucas disagreed on the character: although Lucas saw him as a Bondian playboy, Spielberg and Kasdan felt the professor and adventurer elements of the character made him complex enough. Spielberg had a darker vision of Jones, interpreting him as an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic" title="Alcoholic">alcoholic</a> similar to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a>'s character Fred C. Dobbs in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treasure_of_the_Sierra_Madre_(film)" title="The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a></i>. This characterization fell away during the later drafts. Spielberg also initially conceived of Toht as having a robotic arm, which Lucas rejected as falling into science-fiction. Comic book artist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Steranko" title="Jim Steranko">Jim Steranko</a> was also commissioned to produce original illustrations for pre-production, which heavily influenced Spielberg's decisions in both the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones#Costume_and_equipment" title="Indiana Jones">look</a> of the film and the character of Indiana Jones himself.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initially, the film was rejected by every major studio in Hollywood, as most executives thought that the story was too over the top and would be exceedingly expensive to produce. Eventually Paramount agreed to finance the film, with Lucas negotiating a five picture deal. By April 1980, Kasdan's fifth draft was produced, and production was getting ready to shoot at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elstree_Studios" title="Elstree Studios">Elstree Studios</a>, with Lucas trying to keep costs down. With four illustrators, <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> was Spielberg's most <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard" title="Storyboard">storyboarded</a> film of his career to date, further helping the film economically. He and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule to keep costs down, and to stylistically follow the "quick and dirty" feel of the old Saturday matinÃ©e serials. Special effects were done using puppets, miniature models, animation, and camera trickery. "We didn't do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four. It was like silent film--shoot only what you need, no waste," Spielberg said. "Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie." Lucas also directed some of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_unit" title="Second unit">second unit</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming began on June 23, 1980 at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rochelle" title="La Rochelle">La Rochelle</a>, France, for scenes involving the Nazi submarine, which was rented from the production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Boot" title="Das Boot">Das Boot</a></i>. The U-boat pen was a genuine one that had survived from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The crew moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elstree_Studios" title="Elstree Studios">Elstree Studios</a> for scenes involving the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_of_Souls" title="Well of Souls">Well of Souls</a>, the interiors of the temple in the opening sequence and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood" title="Marion Ravenwood">Marion Ravenwood</a>'s bar. The Well of Souls required 7,000 snakes, though the only poisonous snakes on set were the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobras" title="Cobras">cobras</a>. However, one crew member was bitten by a python on set. To shoot the scene where Indiana comes face-to-face with the cobra, a glass sheet was put between Ford and the reptile, which is partially visible in the film when the light hits it at a certain <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle" title="Angle">angle</a>. Unlike the character he portrayed, Ford does not actually have a fear of snakes; Spielberg was not afraid either, but seeing all the snakes on the set writhing around made him "want to puke". The opening sequence featured live <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantulas" title="Tarantulas">tarantulas</a>: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Molina" title="Alfred Molina">Alfred Molina</a> had to have many put on him, but they did not move until a female tarantula was introduced. A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibreglass" title="Fibreglass">fibreglass</a> boulder 22Â feet (7Â m) in diameter was made for the scene where Indiana escapes the temple; Spielberg was so impressed by production designer Norman Reynolds' realization of his idea that he told Reynolds to increase the length of the boulder run by 50Â feet (15Â m).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All of the scenes set in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> were filmed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, and the canyon where Indiana threatens to blow up the Ark was shot in Sidi Bouhlel, just outside of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozeur" title="Tozeur">Tozeur</a>. The location was previously used in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatooine" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a> scenes from 1977's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</a></i>, since many people in the location crew were the same for both films. Notably, that canyon was exactly the same location where <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a> was attacked by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_races_(F-J)#Jawa" title="List of Star Wars races (F-J)">Jawas</a>. The Tanis scenes were filmed in nearby Sedala and it was a harsh experience due to the heat and disease. Several members of the cast and crew fell ill; Rhys-Davies in particular defecated in his costume during one shot. Spielberg was never ill, as he only ate tinned foods from England. Spielberg did not like the area and quickly pushed forward a scheduled six-week shoot to four-and-a-half weeks. Much was improvised there: the scene where Marion puts on her dress and attempts to leave Belloq's tent was improvised, as was the entire plane fight. During shooting of that scene, Ford tore his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament" title="Cruciate ligament">cruciate ligament</a> in his left leg as a wheel went over his knee, but he did not accept local medical help and simply put ice over it. The fight scenes in the town were filmed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairouan" title="Kairouan">Kairouan</a>; by then Ford was suffering from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery" title="Dysentery">dysentery</a> and did not want to shoot a fight scene between Indiana and a swordsman. He said to Spielberg "Let's just shoot the sucker." Spielberg agreed, scrapped the rest of the fight scene, and filmed the gag of Indiana quickly gunning down the swordsman. The truck chase was shot entirely by the second-unit who mostly followed Spielberg's storyboards, though they decided to add Indiana being dragged by the truck. Spielberg shot all the close-ups with Ford afterwards.</p>

The Washington, D.C. coda, although it appeared in early drafts of the script, was not included in early edits and was added later when it was realized that there was no resolution to Jones's relationship with Marion.

The filming of Indy boarding a Boeing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Clipper" title="China Clipper">China Clipper</a> flying-boat was complicated by the lack of a surviving aircraft.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The special visual effects for <i>Raiders</i> were provided by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic" title="Industrial Light &amp; Magic">Industrial Light &amp; Magic</a> and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat in the water and miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant is opened and the wrath of God is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. The spirits were shot underwater for a ghostly look. The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.</p>

Burtt also used, as he did in many of his films, the ubiquitous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream" title="Wilhelm scream">Wilhelm scream</a> when a Nazi falls from a truck. In addition to his use of such time-honored foley work, Burtt also demonstrated the modern expertise honed during his award-winning work on <i>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</i>. He employed a synthesizer for the sounds of the Ark, and mixed dolphins' and sea lions' screams for those of the spirits within.</p>

Williams originally wrote two different candidates for Indy's theme, but Spielberg enjoyed them so much that he insisted that both be used together in what became the "Raiders' March". The alternately eerie and apocalyptic theme for the Ark of the Covenant is also heard frequently in the score, with a more romantic melody representing Marion and, more broadly, her relationship with Jones.

He later added it to his list of "Great Movies". <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> said the film was "the ultimate Saturday action matineeâ€“a film so funny and exciting it can be enjoyed any day of the week."
