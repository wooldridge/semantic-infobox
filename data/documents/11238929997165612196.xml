It was directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_King_(director)" title="Henry King (director)">Henry King</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was adapted by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Seaton" title="George Seaton">George Seaton</a> from a novelization of Bernadette's story, written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Werfel" title="Franz Werfel">Franz Werfel</a>. The novel was published in 1942 and was extremely popular, spending more than a year on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list" title="New York Times Best Seller list">New York Times Best Seller list</a> and 13 weeks heading the list.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Story">Story</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Francois Soubirous (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Bohnen" title="Roman Bohnen">Roman Bohnen</a>), a former miller now unemployed, is forced to live at the city jail with his wife (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Revere" title="Anne Revere">Anne Revere</a>), his two sons, and his two daughters. One morning he goes to find work, and is told to take the contaminated trash from the hospital and dump it in the cave at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes" title="Lourdes">Lourdes</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the Catholic school which she and her sisters attend, fourteen-year old Bernadette Soubirous (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Jones" title="Jennifer Jones">Jennifer Jones</a>) is shamed in front of the class by Sister Vazous, the teacher (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_Cooper" title="Gladys Cooper">Gladys Cooper</a>), for not having learned her (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism" title="Catechism">catechism</a>) well. AbbÃ© Peyramale (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bickford" title="Charles Bickford">Charles Bickford</a>) enters and awards the students holy cards, but is told by Sister Vazous that Bernadette does not deserve one, because she has not studied, and that it would not be fair to the other students. Peyramale encourages Bernadette to study harder.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later that afternoon, on an errand with her sister Marie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ermadean_Walters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Ermadean Walters (page does not exist)">Ermadean Walters</a>) and school friend Jeanne (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Anderson_(film_actress)" title="Mary Anderson (film actress)">Mary Anderson</a>) to collect firewood outside the town of Lourdes, Bernadette is left behind when her companions warn her not to wade through the cold river by the Massabielle caves for fear of taking ill. About to cross anyway, Bernadette is distracted by a strange breeze and a change in the light. Investigating the cave, she finds a beautiful lady standing in brilliant light, holding a pearl rosary. She tells her sister and friend, who promise not to tell anyone else, but of course they do, and the story soon spreads all over town.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many, including Bernadette's Aunt Bernarde (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_Yurka" title="Blanche Yurka">Blanche Yurka</a>), are convinced of her sincerity and stand up for her against her disbelieving parents, but Bernadette faces civil and church authorities alone. Repeatedly questioned, she stands solidly behind her outlandish story and continues to return to the cave as the lady has asked. She faces ridicule as the lady tells her to drink and wash at a spring that doesn't exist, but digs a hole in the ground and uses the wet sand and mud. The water begins to flow later and exhibits miraculous healing properties. The lady finally identifies herself as "the Immaculate Conception". Civil authorities try to have Bernadette declared insane, while AbbÃ© Peyramale, the fatherly cleric who once doubted her and now becomes her staunchest ally, asks for a formal investigation to find out if Bernadette is a fraud, insane, or genuine. The grotto is closed and the Bishop of Tarbes (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Waldron" title="Charles Waldron">Charles Waldron</a>) declares that unless the Emperor orders the grotto to openedm there will be no investigation by the church. Shortly thereafter, the Emperor's infant son falls ill and, under instructions from the Empress (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Morison" title="Patricia Morison">Patricia Morison</a>), the child's nanny obtains a bottle of the water. Arrested for violating the closure order, she appears in court, identifies herself as the Empress' employee, and pays the fines of the other persons who attempted to enter the grotto, so that they will not have to serve time in jail. The magistrate permits her to go and to take the bottle of water with her. The Emperor's son drinks the water and recovers. The Empress believes that his recovery is miraculous, but the Emperor is not sure. The Empress upbraids him for doubting God, and at her insistence, the Emperor gives the order to reopen the grotto. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Tarbes" title="Bishop of Tarbes">Bishop of Tarbes</a> then directs the commission to convene. The investigation takes many years, and Bernadette is questioned again and again, but the commission eventually determines that Bernadette experienced visions and was visited by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Mary" title="Virgin Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_of_God" title="Mother of God">Mother of God</a>.</p>

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis">Analysis</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plot follows the novel by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Werfel" title="Franz Werfel">Franz Werfel</a>, which is not a documentary but a historical novel blending fact and fiction. Bernadette's real-life friend Antoine Nicolau is portrayed as being deeply in love with her, and vowing to remain unmarried when Bernadette enters the convent. No such relationship is documented as existing between them. The government authorities, in particular Imperial Prosecutor Vital Dutour (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Price" title="Vincent Price">Vincent Price</a>) are portrayed as being much more anti-religion than they actually were, and in fact Dutour was himself a devout <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> who simply thought Bernadette was hallucinating. Other portrayals come closer to historical accuracy, particularly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Revere" title="Anne Revere">Anne Revere</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Bohnen" title="Roman Bohnen">Roman Bohnen</a> as Bernadette's overworked parents, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bickford" title="Charles Bickford">Charles Bickford</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Peyramale" title="Dominique Peyramale">Father Peyramale</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_Yurka" title="Blanche Yurka">Blanche Yurka</a> as formidable Aunt Bernarde.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bernadette's death in particular is "Hollywoodized". She would not have had enough breath to talk that much. Peyramale was not present at her deathbed, having himself died two years before. What is uncertain is whether or not she had a vision before she died. Witnesses said that some hours prior to her death, they saw Bernadette looking across the room with great concentration as she did when experiencing a vision, but she didn't say anything. Her last words were a phrase from the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary" title="Hail Mary">Hail Mary</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jennifer Jones had made two minor films earlier, under her real name of Phylis Isley. Zanuck had her credited as "introducing Jennifer Jones as Bernadette" in order to make the public think she was an unknown.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of the production staff believed The Lady should not be visible to the audience but that Bernadette's adoration of something she saw plainly should "render the invisible visible to others", as Werfel's book said the real Bernadette did. The choice of Darnell (then a few months pregnant) with her reputation as a so-called soft-porn model angered Werfel, who threatened to take his name off the picture. Zanuck was determined to use her, so he told Werfel that he had picked an unknown for the role of the Virgin Mary. He draped Darnell in heavier garments and veiling than the historical Bernadette reported for her lady, and filmed her in brilliant light. Darnell is recognizable in the final scene where she comes into Bernadette's room. The lady's few lines are also spoken by Darnell.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It may be difficult for modern viewers to understand the fuss made about Darnell's casting. The 'soft porn' items in question were not films, but a series of photographs, in some of which Darnell is topless. Werfel apparently saw the pictures and demanded that she be removed from production. At the time, mildly erotic or risquÃ© photos or films were called 'blue', and this expression was used to describe the photographs in Selznick's biography <i>Showman</i> (Abacus, 1993). Darnell often portrayed sexy or sultry characters in films, most notably dance hall girl Chihuahua in the famous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a> Western, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Darling_Clementine_(movie)" title="My Darling Clementine (movie)">My Darling Clementine</a></i>, but also played faithful wives, such as the wives in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_and_Sand_(1941_film)" title="Blood and Sand (1941 film)">Blood and Sand</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfaithfully_Yours" title="Unfaithfully Yours">Unfaithfully Yours</a></i>, as well as virginal sweethearts in such films as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mark_of_Zorro_(1940_film)" title="The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)">The Mark of Zorro</a></i>. She is not known to have made any 'blue' films. Ironically, in later years she became well-known for doing charitable work.</p>
