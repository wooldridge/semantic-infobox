      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finch was born as <b>Frederick George Peter Ingle Finch</b> in London to parents <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Finch_(chemist)" title="George Finch (chemist)">George Finch</a> and Alicia Gladys Fisher, who divorced when he was two years old. George Finch was born in New South Wales, Australia, but was educated in Paris and Zurich. He was a research chemist when he moved to England in 1912 and later served during the first World War with the Royal Army Ordnance Depot and the Royal Field Artillery. In 1915 at Portsmouth in Hampshire George married Alicia Fisher, the daughter of a Kent barrister. However, George Finch was not Peter Finch's biological father. He learned only in his mid-40s that his biological father was Wentworth Edward Dallas "Jock" Campbell, an Indian Army officer, whose adultery with Finch's mother was the cause of his parents' divorce. George gained custody of Peter and he was taken from his mother and raised by his "grandmother" Laura Finch (formerly Black) in France and India, before being sent to Australia in 1926 where he lived with his great uncle Edward Herbert Finch at Greenwich Point in Sydney. Alicia Finch married Peter's father "Jock" Campbell in 1922.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peter Finch was educated at French primary schools until the age of ten, and then in Australia at North Sydney Inter High School in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After school, Finch took several badly paid jobs until he started acting in small parts for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Fitton" title="Doris Fitton">Doris Fitton</a> in 1934. He worked as a sideshow <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruiker" title="Spruiker">spruiker</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Easter_Show" title="Royal Easter Show">Royal Easter Show</a>, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cody" title="Joe Cody">Joe Cody</a> and as a foil to American comedian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bert_le_Blanc&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Bert le Blanc (page does not exist)">Bert le Blanc</a>. A recommendation led to work with George Sorlie's travelling troupe, which in turn led to the attention of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Commission</a> radio drama producer Lawrence H. Cecil, who was to act as his coach and mentor throughout 1939 and 1940. He was "Chris" in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonauts_Club" title="Argonauts Club">Children's Session</a> and the first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muddle-Headed_Wombat" title="The Muddle-Headed Wombat">Muddle-Headed Wombat</a>. He later starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neva_Carr_Glyn" title="Neva Carr Glyn">Neva Carr Glyn</a> in an enormously popular series by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Afford" title="Max Afford">Max Afford</a> as husband-and-wife detectives <i>Jeffery and Elizabeth Blackburn</i> as well as other ABC radio plays. He landed his first film in 1938, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dad_and_Dave_Come_to_Town" title="Dad and Dave Come to Town">Dad and Dave Come to Town</a></i>, a small part which failed to attract any notice.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finch's forte, however, remained the stage. He founded the Mercury Theatre Company in Sydney in the mid 1940s. He was noticed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> in the late 1940s. Olivier encouraged Finch to return to London for a role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Daphne_Laureola&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Daphne Laureola (page does not exist)">Daphne Laureola</a></i> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Vic" title="Old Vic">Old Vic</a>. During this time, his closeness to the Olivier family led to an affair with Olivier's beautiful but increasingly unstable wife, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, which began in 1948, and continued on and off for several years, ultimately falling apart due to her deteriorating mental condition.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite his stage experience, Finch, like his mentor Olivier, suffered from stage fright. As a break from stage parts, in the late 1940s, he turned to performing in films. His first role in a British-made film was in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_Stockade_(film)" title="Eureka Stockade (film)">Eureka Stockade</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_in_film" title="1949 in film">1949</a>), set in Australia. In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_in_film" title="1950 in film">1950</a>, he made his Hollywood film debut in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miniver_Story" title="The Miniver Story">The Miniver Story</a></i>, the sequel to the wartime morale boosting movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Miniver_(film)" title="Mrs. Miniver (film)">Mrs. Miniver</a></i>; unlike its predecessor, it was poorly received critically. In 1955, he appeared with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Cilento" title="Diane Cilento">Diane Cilento</a> in the film <i>Passage Home</i>. His first major role was in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1956_in_film" title="1956 in film">1956</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Town_Like_Alice" title="A Town Like Alice">A Town Like Alice</a></i>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_in_film" title="1971 in film">1971</a>, Finch played the homosexual Jewish doctor in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Bloody_Sunday_(film)" title="Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)">Sunday Bloody Sunday</a></i>, earning an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> nomination for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Best Actor in a Leading Role</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the time of his death, he was doing a promotional tour for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_in_film" title="1976 in film">1976</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_(film)" title="Network (film)">Network</a></i> in which he played the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television" title="Television">television</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter" title="News presenter">anchorman</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Beale" title="Howard Beale">Howard Beale</a> who develops messianic pretensions.

However he was held up filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Go-Between" title="The Go-Between">The Go-Between</a></i> (1970) and was replaced first by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bannen" title="Ian Bannen">Ian Bannen</a> and later by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Finch" title="Peter Finch">Peter Finch</a>.

	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bannen" title="Ian Bannen">Ian Bannen</a> was fired from the role of Daniel Hirsh shortly after filming began. Apparently, he was so nervous about what kissing another actor on screen might do to his career, he could not concentrate enough to even get going with the part. He later said that losing the role set back his career, and regretted it till his death.</li>
	<li>Actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis" title="Daniel Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> made his film debut at the age of 14 in this film as a vandal in an uncredited role.
