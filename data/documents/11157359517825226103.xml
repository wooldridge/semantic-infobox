	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soprano" title="Soprano">soprano</a>, Hathaway performed in 1998 and 1999 with the All-Eastern U.S. High School Honors Chorus at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Hall" title="Carnegie Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> and has performed in plays at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seton_Hall_Prep" title="Seton Hall Prep">Seton Hall Prep</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Orange,_New_Jersey" title="West Orange, New Jersey">West Orange, New Jersey</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hathaway's first role in a motion picture was as Jean Sabin in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Side_of_Heaven" title="The Other Side of Heaven">The Other Side of Heaven</a></i>, opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Gorham" title="Christopher Gorham">Christopher Gorham</a>.

Hathaway auditioned for the role during a flight layover on the way to New Zealand and won the role after only one audition. Marshall claimed that he loved her immediately because she fell off her chair during the audition and believed her clumsiness would make her perfect for the role. (However, in a 2008 conversation with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Carell" title="Steve Carell">Steve Carell</a>, Hathaway denied that she fell during this audition, although she openly admits to being a "klutz".) <i>The Princess Diaries</i> was released before <i>The Other Side of Heaven</i> in the hopes that its success would increase interest in <i>Heaven</i>. Across the world, <i>The Princess Diaries</i> was a commercial success, and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel" title="Sequel">sequel</a> was planned shortly after. Many critics praised Hathaway's performance in <i>Diaries;</i> a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> critic noted that "Hathaway shines in the title role and generates great chemistry." <i>The Other Side of Heaven</i> met with mostly negative reviews, but it performed well for a religion-themed film.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In February 2002, Hathaway starred in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Center" title="City Center">City Center</a> Encores! concert production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival!" title="Carnival!">Carnival!</a></i> in New York City, receiving positive reviews for her portrayal of Lili.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hathaway continued to appear in family-oriented films over the next three years, subsequently becoming known in mainstream media as a children's role model. In 2002, she appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Nickleby_(2002_film)" title="Nicholas Nickleby (2002 film)">Nicholas Nickleby</a></i>, opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hunnam" title="Charlie Hunnam">Charlie Hunnam</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Bell" title="Jamie Bell">Jamie Bell</a>, which opened to positive reviews. The <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Herald" title="Northwest Herald">Northwest Herald</a></i> referred to it as "an unbelievably fun film", and the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_News" title="Deseret News">Deseret News</a></i> said that the cast was "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a>-worthy". Despite critical acclaim, the film never entered wide release and failed at the North American box office, totaling less than $4 million in ticket sales.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hathaway's next film role was as the titular character in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Enchanted_(film)" title="Ella Enchanted (film)">Ella Enchanted</a></i> (2004), the film adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Enchanted" title="Ella Enchanted">the novel</a>, which opened to mostly indifferent reviews. Hathaway sang two songs in the film as well as three on the soundtrack, including a duet with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_McCartney" title="Jesse McCartney">Jesse McCartney</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2004, Hathaway dropped out of her role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(2004_film)" title="The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)">The Phantom of the Opera</a>,</i> because the production schedule of the film overlapped with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Diaries_2:_Royal_Engagement" title="The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement">The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement</a>,</i> which she was contractually obligated to make.

The film opened to negative reviews, but commissioned $95.1 million against a $40 -million budget.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hathaway began appearing in dramatic roles after <i>The Princess Diaries 2</i>. She said that "anybody who was a role model for children needs a reprieve", although she noted that "it's lovely to think that my audience is growing up with me". She voiced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Riding_Hood" title="Little Red Riding Hood">Little Red Riding Hood</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodwinked!" title="Hoodwinked!">Hoodwinked!</a></i> (2005), which received generally positive reviews. That same year, Hathaway starred in the R-rated <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havoc_(film)" title="Havoc (film)">Havoc</a></i>, in which she played a spoiled socialite. Hathaway was featured in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity_in_film" title="Nudity in film">nude</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_scene" title="Sex scene">sexual scenes</a> in the film. Although the content of the film was different from her previous films, Hathaway denied that her role was an attempt to be seen as a more mature actress, citing her belief that doing nudity in certain movies is merely a part of what her chosen form of art demands of her; and because of that belief she does not consider appearing nude in appropriate films to be morally objectionable.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After <i>Havoc,</i> Hathaway was in the drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain" title="Brokeback Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a></i>. <i>Havoc</i> was not released in theaters in the United States (but was later released in other countries) because of its weak critical reception, but <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> won rave reviews for its depiction of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> relationship in the 1960s and received several Academy Award nominations. Hathaway would later assert that the content of <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> was more important than its award count and that making the film made her more aware of the kind of stories she wanted to tell as an actress.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hathaway was in the 2006 comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(film)" title="The Devil Wears Prada (film)">The Devil Wears Prada</a>,</i> in which she starred as an assistant to a powerful <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_magazine" title="Fashion magazine">fashion magazine</a> editor portrayed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep" title="Meryl Streep">Meryl Streep</a>, whom Hathaway described as being "just divine". Hathaway said that working on the film made her respect the fashion industry a great deal more than she had previously, though she claimed that her personal style is something she "still can't get right". In an interview with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly" title="Us Weekly">Us Weekly</a></i>, Hathaway discussed the weight loss regime she and co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Blunt" title="Emily Blunt">Emily Blunt</a> followed for the film, she stated, "I basically stuck with fruit, vegetables and fish [to slim down]. I wouldn't recommend that. Emily Blunt and I would clutch at each other and cry because we were so hungry."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hathaway was cast in the 2007 comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocked_Up" title="Knocked Up">Knocked Up</a></i>, but dropped out before filming began and was replaced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Heigl" title="Katherine Heigl">Katherine Heigl</a>. Writer/director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Apatow" title="Judd Apatow">Judd Apatow</a> stated in a May 2007 issue of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Magazine" title="The New York Times Magazine">The New York Times Magazine</a></i> that Hathaway dropped out "because she didn't want to allow us to use real footage of a woman giving birth to create the illusion that she is giving birth". In an August 2008 interview with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Claire" title="Marie Claire">Marie Claire</a></i>, Hathaway commented that she "didn't believe that it was necessary to the story".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hathaway was in the 2007 drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becoming_Jane" title="Becoming Jane">Becoming Jane</a>,</i> in which she portrayed English writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Burton" title="Tim Burton">Tim Burton</a> considered Hathaway for the part of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna_Barker" title="Johanna Barker">Johanna Barker</a> in his 2007 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweeney_Todd:_The_Demon_Barber_of_Fleet_Street_(2007_film)" title="Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)">Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</a>,</i> but the role went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayne_Wisener" title="Jayne Wisener">Jayne Wisener</a>, a then-unknown actress, reportedly because Burton decided he wanted an unknown, younger actress for the part.</p>

At home, the atmosphere is strained between Kym and her family members as they struggle to reconcile themselves with her past and present. Kym's father shows intense concern for her well-being and whereabouts, which Kym interprets as mistrust. She also resents her sister's choice of her best friend Emma (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anisa_George&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Anisa George (page does not exist)">Anisa George</a>), rather than Kym, to be her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_of_honor" title="Maid of honor">maid of honor</a>.

As a teenager, Kym was responsible for the death of her young brother Ethan, who was left in her care one day despite her being high at the time.

Rachel, hearing this, storms out. The story, it turns out, was all a lie â€” an apparent attempt by Kym to evade responsibility for her addiction. The sisters' fight comes to a head later that night, leading Kym to escape to her mother's house. However, she finds no respite there, as a fight with her mother comes to blows. She runs off again, this time intentionally crashing a car into a giant rock, and spends the night in the car.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many reviewers praised the film for its organic, unfussy feel; Salon reviewer Stephanie Zacharek noted that "with 'Rachel Getting Married,' Demme has once again scaled back, making a picture that has some of the ease and warmth of his earlier movies, although it also feels stripped down and direct in a way that's new for Demme."  USA Today proclaimed: "After a foray in documentary films, director Jonathan Demme has returned to narrative storytelling, assuming a decidedly cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ© style that has echoes of Robert Altman. The film's greatest asset is the sense of cringing realism in portraying dinner parties and interpersonal encounters that can throw family members off-kilter." . The Los Angeles Times noted: "Helping give this story its essential air of reality is the decision Demme and cinematographer Quinn made to shoot it as what they call 'the most beautiful home movie ever made.'" The director chose not to plan shots in advance, instead giving Quinn (whose credits include Mira Nair's "Monsoon Wedding") the ability to respond in the moment to what was going on with the actors, and it's a tribute to his ability (and that of editor Tim Squyres) that his camera always seems to be in the right place at the right time." .</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anne Hathaway won raves for her work as Kym. USA Today called her "wonderful... [Kym's] nervous laughter, edginess and quick temper blend convincingly with her need for attention and vulnerability."  Newsweek commented: "Kym is a major pain in the ass, and Hathaway's raw, spiky performance makes no attempt to ingratiate. Yet she makes Kym's inner torment so palpable you can't help but feel for her, however insufferable she may be. It's a terrific performance..." . Empire felt that "Kym is a peach of a role â€” she sleeps with the best man, fights with the maid of honour, quips, 'Youâ€™re so thin, itâ€™s like youâ€™re Asian' â€” and Hathaway squeezes it for all the juice itâ€™s worth, making this raw-nerved, narcissistic Tasmanian Devil not just believable, but somehow likable." </p>

Here, Hitchcock stars as a wedding guest. At the ceremony Hitchcock, at the request of Demme, performs the song "America" from his 1982 album Groovy Decay.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">"My memory of the whole thing is of being at a real wedding, although without the alcohol. A lot was shot in real time and the end result was the whole thing seemed as if it really had happened. It's as real as it gets," Hitchcock says. "By the time I did 'Up To Our Nex' in the tent I had 15 people.
