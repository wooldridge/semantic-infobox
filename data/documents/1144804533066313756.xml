	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam,_New_York" title="Amsterdam, New York">Amsterdam, New York</a> as Issur Herschelovich Danielovitch, to Bryna "Bertha" (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Sanglel) and Herschel "Harry" Demsky, a businessman. Douglas's parents, originally surnamed Danielovitch, were Jewish immigrants from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomel" title="Gomel">Gomel</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>. His father's brother, who emigrated earlier, used the surname Demsky, which Douglas's family adopted in the United States. In addition to their surname, his parents also changed their given names in the American manner, to Harry and Bertha. Douglas grew up as Izzy Demsky, although he never legally changed his name.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coming from a poor family, as a boy, Douglas sold snacks to mill workers to earn enough to buy milk and bread. Later, he delivered newspapers and claims to have worked at more than forty jobs before becoming an actor. He found living in a family of six sisters to be stifling, "I was dying to get out. In a sense, it lit a fire under me." During high school, he acted in school plays, and discovered "The one thing in my life that I always knew, that was always constant, was that I wanted to be an actor."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unable to afford tuition, Douglas talked his way into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence_University" title="St. Lawrence University">St. Lawrence University</a> and received a loan, which he paid back by working part-time as a gardener and a janitor. He was a standout on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestler" title="Wrestler">wrestling</a> team, and wrestled one summer in a carnival to make money.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas's acting talents were noticed at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Dramatic_Arts" title="American Academy of Dramatic Arts">American Academy of Dramatic Arts</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and he received a special scholarship. One of his classmates was Betty Joan Perske (later to become better known as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Bacall" title="Lauren Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>), who would play an important role in launching his film career. Another classmate was aspiring Bermudian actress, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Dill" title="Diana Dill">Diana Dill</a>. While doing summer stock theater during a college term break, he began using the name Kirk Douglas, which he later would legally adopt. He earned his first money as an actor that summer. Graduating from drama school, Douglas made his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut as a singing telegraph boy in <i>Spring Again</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas enlisted in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> in 1941, shortly after the United States entered <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. He was medically discharged for war injuries in 1944. On May 3, 1943, Diana Dill, his former classmate, appeared on the cover of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)" title="Life (magazine)"><i>Life</i> magazine</a>. Seeing the photograph, Douglas told his fellow sailors that he was going to marry her. He did, on November 2, 1943. The couple had two sons together (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Douglas" title="Michael Douglas">Michael</a> in 1944 and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Douglas" title="Joel Douglas">Joel</a> in 1947) before they divorced in 1951.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the war, Douglas returned to New York City and found work in radio theatre and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising" title="Advertising">commercials</a>. His stage break occurred in <i>Kiss and Tell</i>, which led to other roles. Douglas had planned to remain a stage actor but Lauren Bacall helped him get his first screen role in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_B._Wallis" title="Hal B. Wallis">Hal B. Wallis</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strange_Love_of_Martha_Ivers" title="The Strange Love of Martha Ivers">The Strange Love of Martha Ivers</a></i> (1946), starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Stanwyck" title="Barbara Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a>. Wallis was on his way to New York to look for new talent when Bacall suggested he visit Douglas, who was rehearsing a play called <i>The Wind Is Ninety</i>. Douglas finished the play's run and with no follow-up work in sight, headed to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. He was immediately cast in one of the leading roles in Wallis' film, and made his film acting debut as a weak man dominated by a ruthless woman, unlike his later roles where he often played dominating characters.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas established his image as a tough guy in his eighth film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_(1949_movie)" title="Champion (1949 movie)">Champion</a></i>, playing a selfish boxer. From then on, he made a career of playing "sons of bitches." From that film on, he decided that to succeed as a star, he needed to ramp up his intensity, overcome his natural shyness, and choose stronger roles. He conceded later, "I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be much of an actor without vanity. And Iâ€™m not interested in being a 'modest actor'." Early in his Hollywood career, he demonstrated his independent streak and broke his studio contracts to gain total control over his projects, forming his own movie company "Bryna Productions", named after his mother.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas made his Broadway debut in 1949 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov" title="Chekhov">Chekhov</a>'s play, "The Three Sisters," a production by actress-producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Cornell" title="Katharine Cornell">Katharine Cornell</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas was a major box office star in the 1950s and 60s, playing opposite some of the leading actresses of that era including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Bacall" title="Lauren Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Stanwyck" title="Barbara Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Day" title="Doris Day">Doris Day</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Crain" title="Jeanne Crain">Jeanne Crain</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhonda_Fleming" title="Rhonda Fleming">Rhonda Fleming</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Mayo" title="Virginia Mayo">Virginia Mayo</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Grahame" title="Gloria Grahame">Gloria Grahame</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizabeth_Scott" title="Lizabeth Scott">Lizabeth Scott</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laraine_Day" title="Laraine Day">Laraine Day</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Wyman" title="Jane Wyman">Jane Wyman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Parker" title="Eleanor Parker">Eleanor Parker</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Turner" title="Lana Turner">Lana Turner</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Novak" title="Kim Novak">Kim Novak</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Hayward" title="Susan Hayward">Susan Hayward</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Leigh" title="Janet Leigh">Janet Leigh</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Simmons" title="Jean Simmons">Jean Simmons</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among his various roles, Douglas played a frontier peace officer in his first western <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Along_the_Great_Divide" title="Along the Great Divide">Along the Great Divide</a></i> (1951). Douglas quickly became comfortable with riding horses and playing gunslingers, and returned in many westerns. In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Are_the_Brave" title="Lonely Are the Brave">Lonely Are the Brave</a></i> (1962), one of his favorite roles, Douglas plays a cowboy trying to live by his own code, much as he did in real life.</p>

In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Man_with_a_Horn_(film)" title="Young Man with a Horn (film)">Young Man with a Horn</a></i> (1950), Douglas portrays the rise and fall of a driven jazz musician, based on real-life horn player <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bix_Beiderbecke" title="Bix Beiderbecke">Bix Beiderbecke</a>. Composer-pianist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoagy_Carmichael" title="Hoagy Carmichael">Hoagy Carmichael</a>, playing the sidekick role, added realism to the film and gave Douglas insight into the role, being a friend of the real Beiderbecke.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In one of his early <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television" title="Television">television</a> appearances Douglas was a musical guest (as Himself) on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jack_Benny_Program" title="The Jack Benny Program">The Jack Benny Program</a></i>. In the opening monologue, Benny reads the reviews of critics who liked his season premiere, while skipping the ones who did not.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas played many military men, with varying nuance, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Secret_Affair" title="Top Secret Affair">Top Secret Affair</a></i> (1957), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paths_of_Glory" title="Paths of Glory">Paths of Glory</a></i> (1957) (his most famous role in that genre), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_Without_Pity" title="Town Without Pity">Town Without Pity</a></i> (1961), <i>The Hook</i> (1963), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_in_May" title="Seven Days in May">Seven Days in May</a></i> (1964), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Telemark" title="Heroes of Telemark">Heroes of Telemark</a></i> (1965), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Harm%27s_Way" title="In Harm's Way">In Harm's Way</a></i> (1965), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_a_Giant_Shadow" title="Cast a Giant Shadow">Cast a Giant Shadow</a></i> (1966), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_Paris_Burning" title="Is Paris Burning">Is Paris Burning</a></i> (1966), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Countdown_(film)" title="The Final Countdown (film)">The Final Countdown</a></i> (1980).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His role as Vincent Van Gogh in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust_for_Life_(film)" title="Lust for Life (film)">Lust for Life</a></i> (1956), filmed mostly on location in France, was noted not only for the veracity of his appearance but also for how he conveyed the painterâ€™s internal turmoil. He won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actor_%E2%80%93_Motion_Picture_Drama" title="Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Motion Picture Drama">Golden Globe</a> award for his role. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincente_Minnelli" title="Vincente Minnelli">Vincente Minnelli</a> stated, "Kirk Douglas achieved a moving and memorable portrait of the artistâ€”a man of massive creative power, triggered by severe emotional stress, the fear and horror of madness. In my opinion, Kirk should have won the Academy Award." Douglas himself called his acting role as Van Gogh a "very painful experience." He writes, "Not only did I look like Van Gogh, I was the same age he was when he committed suicide."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas played the lead with an all-star cast in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus_(film)" title="Spartacus (film)">Spartacus</a></i> (1960). He was the executive producer as well, raising the $12 million production cost. He also played an important role in breaking the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_blacklist" title="Hollywood blacklist">Hollywood blacklist</a> by making sure that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Trumbo" title="Dalton Trumbo">Dalton Trumbo</a>'s name was mentioned in the opening and ending credits of the film for the outstanding screenplay he did for the film. Douglas initially selected <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mann" title="Anthony Mann">Anthony Mann</a> to direct the movie, but dismissed him when he judged the initial shooting to be unsatisfactory. To replace Mann he chose <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, who three years earlier had collaborated closely with Douglas in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paths_of_Glory" title="Paths of Glory">Paths of Glory</a></i>, where Douglas played one of his most notable roles as Colonel Dax, the commander of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">French</a> regiment during <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>. <i>Spartacus</i> was a huge success, but Kubrick, considering himself a mere employee of Douglas and since much of the footage (including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ustinov" title="Peter Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a>'s key scenes) was shot under Mann, did not consider it to be part of his own oeuvre.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to serious, driven characters, Douglas was adept at roles requiring a comic touch, as in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20,000_Leagues_Under_the_Sea_(1954_film)" title="20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)">20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</a></i> (1954), an adaptation of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a> novel, wherein he plays a happy-go-lucky sailor who is the opposite in every way of the brooding Captain Nemo (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mason" title="James Mason">James Mason</a>). The film was one of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s most successful live-action movies and a major box-office hit. He manages a similar comic turn in the western <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Without_a_Star" title="Man Without a Star">Man Without a Star</a></i> (1955) and in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Love_or_Money_(1963_film)" title="For Love or Money (1963 film)">For Love or Money</a></i> (1963).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas made seven films over the decades with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Lancaster" title="Burt Lancaster">Burt Lancaster</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Walk_Alone" title="I Walk Alone">I Walk Alone</a></i> (1948), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfight_at_the_OK_Corral_(1957_film)" title="Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957 film)">Gunfight at the OK Corral</a></i> (1957), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Disciple_(1959_film)" title="The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)">The Devil's Disciple</a></i> (1959), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_List_of_Adrian_Messenger" title="The List of Adrian Messenger">The List of Adrian Messenger</a></i> (1963), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_in_May" title="Seven Days in May">Seven Days in May</a></i> (1964), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_at_Entebbe" title="Victory at Entebbe">Victory at Entebbe</a></i> (1976) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tough_Guys" title="Tough Guys">Tough Guys</a></i> (1986). Douglas was always second-billed under Lancaster in these films but, with the exception of <i>I Walk Alone</i>, in which Douglas played a villain, and <i>The List of Adrian Messenger</i>, in which Lancaster played a brief part in disguise, their roles were more or less the same size. Both actors arrived in Hollywood at the same time, and first appeared together in the fourth film for each. They both became actor-producers who sought out independent Hollywood careers.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas stated that the keys to acting success are determination and application, "You must know how to function and how to maintain yourself, and you must have a love of what you do. But an actor also needs great good luck. I have had that luck." Douglas had great vitality, "It takes a lot out of you to work in this business. Many people fall by the wayside because they donâ€™t have the energy to sustain their talent." His intensity spilled over into all elements of his film-making. As an actor, he dove into every role, dissecting not only his own lines but all the parts in the script to measure the rightness of the role, and he was willing to fight with the director if he felt justified. According to his wife, he often brought home that intensity, "When he was doing <i>Lust for Life</i>, he came home in that red beard of Van Goghâ€™s, wearing those big boots, stomping around the houseâ€”it was frightening." His distinctive acting style and delivery made him, like <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(actor)" title="James Stewart (actor)">James Stewart</a>, a favorite with impersonators, especially <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gorshin" title="Frank Gorshin">Frank Gorshin</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike some actors like <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mitchum" title="Robert Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a>, Douglas had a high opinion of actors, movies, and moviemaking, "To me it is the most important art formâ€”it <i>is</i> an art, and it includes all the elements of the modern age." But he also stressed the entertainment value of films, "You can make a statement, you can say something, but it must be entertaining."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His first film as a director was <i>Scalawag</i> (1973). In his autobiography <i>The Ragmanâ€™s Son</i>, he said "Since I was accused so often of trying to direct the films I was in, I thought I ought to really try my hand at directing." It was a difficult debut with many production problems, requiring his wife to act as producer. Douglas plays a charming scoundrel with one leg, a considerable challenge to his athleticism, and though he got credit for his role, the film received unimpressive reviews. Later in 1973, Douglas appeared in a made-for-TV musical version of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde" title="Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Douglas was nominated three times for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for his work in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_(1949_film)" title="Champion (1949 film)">Champion</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bad_and_the_Beautiful" title="The Bad and the Beautiful">The Bad and the Beautiful</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust_for_Life_(film)" title="Lust for Life (film)">Lust for Life</a></i>. He was especially disappointed for not winning for the latter film, "I really thought I had a chance." Douglas did not win any competitive Oscars, but received a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorary_Academy_Award" title="Honorary Academy Award">Honorary Academy Award</a> in 1996 for "50 years as a moral and creative force in the motion picture community".</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1991, he survived a helicopter crash in which two people died. This sparked a search for meaning, which led him, after much study, to embrace the Judaism in which he was raised. He documented this spiritual journey in his book <i>Climbing the Mountain: My Search for Meaning</i> (2001). In his autobiography, <i>The Ragman's Son</i>, he writes that "coming to grips with what it means to be a Jew has been a theme in my life."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1996, he suffered a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke" title="Stroke">stroke</a>, partially impairing his ability to speak.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A portrait of Douglas, titled "The Great and the Beautiful," which encapsulated his film career, art collection, philanthropy and rehabilitation from the helicopter crash and the stroke, appeared in <i>Palm Springs Life</i> magazine in 1999. The article said "For years, this energetic performer could be seen jogging several miles to get his morning paper, playing tennis with locals or posing for snapshots and signing autographs for star-struck out-of-towners. He has been a veritable one-man tourist promotion over the past four decades, extolling the virtue of the city he loves to virtually anyone who'll listen".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the film was released, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a>, the film critic for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a>,</i> believed the drama was not exactly faithful to the original Lardner story, which had a very hard-edge. Still, he gave the boxing drama a positive review, and wrote, "However, Director Mark Robson has covered up story weaknesses with a wealth of pictorial interests and exciting action of a graphic, colorful sort. His scenes in training gymnasiums, managers' offices and, of course, the big fight rings arc strongly atmospheric and physically intense. Except that the fighting is more furious than one can credit, it is virtually all right. As the hero and "Champion," Kirk Douglas does a good, aggressive job, with a slight inclination to over-eagerness at times, which might amuse an old fight fan. Arthur Kennedy is dour as his crippled brother who distrusts the slaughterous sport, and Marilyn Maxwell, Ruth Roman and Lola Albright are attractive as the "champ's" various girls. Paul Stewart is most convincing as a quiet, hard-bitten manager."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The staff at <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> magazine gave the picture a good review and also noted the difference between the screenplay and the original story. They wrote, "Adapted from a Ring Lardner short story of the same title, <i>Champion</i> is a stark, realistic study of the boxing rackets and the degeneracy of a prizefighter. Fight scenes, under Franz Planer's camera, have realism and impact. Unrelenting pace is set by the opening sequence. Cast, under Mark Robson's tight direction, is fine. Kirk Douglas is the boxer and he makes the character live. Second honors go jointly to Arthur Kennedy, the fighter's crippled brother, and Paul Stewart as the knowing manager."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The review aggregator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reported that 92% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on thirteen reviews.</p>
