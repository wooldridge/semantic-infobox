			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908
				in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana,_Pennsylvania" title="Indiana, Pennsylvania">Indiana, Pennsylvania</a>, the son of Elizabeth
				Ruth (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">née</a> Jackson) and Alexander Maitland
				Stewart, who owned a hardware store. Stewart's parents were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people" title="Scottish people">Scottish</a>
				<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> origin. His Jackson ancestors served in
				the American Revolution, War of 1812 and the Civil War. The eldest of three children
				(he had two younger sisters, Virginia and Mary), he was expected to continue his
				father's business, which had been in the family for three generations.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His mother was an excellent pianist but his
				father discouraged Stewart's request for lessons. But when his father accepted a
				gift of an accordion from a guest, young Stewart quickly learned to play the
				instrument, which became a fixture off-stage during his acting career. As the family
				grew, music continued to be an important part of family life.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercersburg_Academy" title="Mercersburg Academy">Mercersburg Academy</a> prep school, graduating in
				1928. At Mercersburg, Stewart was active in a variety of activities. He played on
				the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football" title="Football">football</a> team and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_(track_and_field)" title="Athletics (track and field)">track</a> team. He was art editor for the
				KARUX yearbook and member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir" title="Choir">choir</a> club, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(music)" title="Glee (music)">glee</a> club, and John Marshall Literary Society. During
				his first summer break, Stewart returned to Indiana Pennsylvania to work as a brick
				loader for a local construction company and on highway and road construction jobs
				where he painted lines on the roads. Over the following two summers, he took a job
				as an assistant with a professional magician. He also made his first appearance on
				the stage at Mercersburg, as Buquet in the play <i>The Wolves</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A shy child, Stewart spent much of his after
				school time in the basement working on model airplanes, mechanical drawing and
				chemistry — all with a dream of going into aviation. But he abandoned visions of
				being a pilot when his father insisted that instead of the Naval Academy he attend
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart enrolled at Princeton in 1928 as a
				member of the Class of 1932. There, he excelled at studying <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, so impressing his professors with his thesis on an airport
				design that he was awarded a scholarship for graduate studies, but he gradually
				became attracted to the school's drama and music clubs, including the famous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Triangle_Club" title="Princeton Triangle Club">Princeton Triangle Club</a>. He was a member of
				the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Charter_Club" title="Princeton Charter Club">Princeton Charter Club</a> as well as a head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleading" title="Cheerleading">cheerleader</a>. In his spare time, he enjoyed going to the

				just displacing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_films" title="Silent films">silent films</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His acting and accordion talents at Princeton
				led him to be invited to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Players" title="University Players">University Players</a>, an intercollegiate summer
				stock company in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Falmouth" title="West Falmouth">West
					Falmouth</a> a town on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This company had been organized
				in 1928 and would run until 1932, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Logan" title="Joshua Logan">Joshua
					Logan</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretaigne_Windust" title="Bretaigne Windust">Bretaigne Windust</a>, and Charles Leatherbee as the directors. Stewart
				performed in bit parts in the Players' productions in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod" title="Cape Cod">Cape Cod</a>
				during the Summer of 1932 after he graduated. The troupe had previously included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, who married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sullavan" title="Margaret Sullavan">Margaret Sullavan</a> on Christmas Day 1931 while the University Players were
				located in Baltimore for an 18-week winter season. Sullavan, who had rejoined the
				University Players in Baltimore in November 1931 at the close of the post-Broadway
				tour of <i>A Modern Virgin,</i> left the Players for good at the end of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_of_Mary_Dugan" title="The Trial of Mary Dugan">The Trial of Mary Dugan</a> in Baltimore in
				March 1932. By the time Stewart joined the University Players on Cape Cod after his
				graduation from Princeton in 1932, Fonda and Sullavan's brief marriage had ended.
				Stewart and Fonda became great friends over the summer of 1932 when they shared an
				apartment with Joshua Logan and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_McCormick" title="Myron McCormick">Myron McCormick</a>. When he came to New York at the end of the summer stock
				season, which had included the Broadway try-out of <i>Goodbye Again</i>, he shared
				an apartment with Henry Fonda, who had by then finalized his divorce from Sullavan.
				Along with fellow University Players, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Dalrymple&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Alfred Dalrymple (page does not exist)">Alfred Dalrymple</a> and Myron
				McCormick, Stewart had his Broadway debut as a chauffeur in the comedy <i>Goodbye
					Again</i>, in which he had two lines. <i>The New Yorker</i> noted, "Mr. James
				Stewart's chauffeur... comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of
				spontaneous applause."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The play was a moderate success, but times were
				hard. Many Broadway theaters had been converted to movie houses and the Depression
				was reaching bottom. "From 1932 through 1934," Stewart later recalled, "I'd only
				worked three months. Every play I got into folded." By 1934, he got more substantial
				stage roles, including the hit, <i>Page Miss Glory</i>, and his first dramatic stage
				role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Howard" title="Sidney Howard">Sidney Howard</a>'s <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Jack_(play_and_film)" title="Yellow Jack (play and film)">Yellow Jack</a>
				</i>, which convinced him to continue his acting career. However, Stewart and Fonda,
				still roommates, were both struggling.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the fall of 1934, Fonda's success in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farmer_Takes_a_Wife" title="The Farmer Takes a Wife">The Farmer Takes a Wife</a>
				</i> took him to Hollywood. Finally, Stewart attracted the interest of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> scout Bill Grady who saw Stewart on the
				opening night of <i>Divided by Three</i>, a glittering première with many luminaries
				in attendance including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Berlin" title="Irving Berlin">Irving
					Berlin</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss_Hart" title="Moss Hart">Moss Hart</a> and his buddy Fonda who had returned to New York
				for the show. With Fonda's encouragement, Stewart agreed to take the screen test and
				signed a contract with MGM in April 1935, as a contract player for up to seven years
				at $350 a week.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On his arrival by train to Los Angeles, Fonda
				greeted Stewart at the station and took him to Fonda's studio-supplied lodging,
				right next door to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo" title="Greta Garbo">Greta
					Garbo</a>. His first job at the studio was as a participant in the screen tests
				done for newly arrived starlets. At first, he had trouble being cast in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> films due to his gangling looks and shy, humble screen presence.
				His first film was the poorly received <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer
					Tracy</a> vehicle, <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murder_Man" title="The Murder Man">The Murder Man</a>
				</i>, but <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Marie_(operetta)" title="Rose Marie (operetta)">Rose Marie</a>
				</i>, an adaptation of a popular operetta, was more successful. After mixed success
				in films, he received his first substantial part in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_in_film" title="1936 in film">1936</a>'s
						<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_the_Thin_Man" title="After the Thin Man">After the Thin Man</a>.</i></p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the romantic front, he found himself dating
				newly-divorced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Rogers" title="Ginger Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a>, whom he had revered while a student at
				Princeton only a few years earlier. The romance soon cooled, however, and by chance
				Stewart encountered Margaret Sullavan again. Stewart found his footing in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> thanks largely to Sullavan who campaigned for Stewart to be her
				leading man in the 1936 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy" title="Romantic comedy">romantic comedy</a>
				<i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Time_We_Love" title="Next Time We Love">Next Time We Love</a>
				</i>. She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his
				confidence. She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms
				and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style. In the meantime, roommate
				Fonda continued to arrange parties with starlets, who found Stewart different from
				the other young actors and irresistible in his own way. Stewart was enjoying
				Hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage, as he worked six days a
				week in the MGM factory.In 1936, he acquired big-time agent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Hayward" title="Leland Hayward">Leland
					Hayward</a>, who would eventually marry Margaret Sullavan. Hayward started to
				chart Stewart's career, deciding the best path for him was through loan-outs to
				other studios.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1938, Stewart had a brief, tumultuous, and
				well-publicized romance with Hollywood queen <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Shearer" title="Norma Shearer">Norma
					Shearer</a> whose husband <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a>, head of production at MGM, had died two years earlier.
				Stewart began a successful partnership with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank
					Capra</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_in_film" title="1938 in film">1938</a>,
				when he was loaned out to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> to star in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can%27t_Take_It_With_You_(film)" title="You Can't Take It With You (film)">You Can't Take It With You</a>
				</i>. Frank Capra had been impressed by Stewart's minor role in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Blue_and_Gold" title="Navy Blue and Gold">Navy Blue and Gold</a>
				</i> (1937). The director had recently completed several popular movies including <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Happened_One_Night" title="It Happened One Night">It Happened One Night</a>
				</i> and was looking for the right type of actor to suit his needs—which other
				recent actors in his films such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark
					Gable</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Colman" title="Ronald Colman">Ronald Colman</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary
					Cooper</a> did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart just what he was looking for,
				but Capra also found Stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very
				little directing. Later Capra commented, "I think he's probably the best actor who's
				ever hit the screen."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This heart-warming <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Depression" title="The Great Depression">Depression</a>-era film <i>(You Can't Take It With
					You)</i>, starring Capra's "favorite actress", comedienne <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Arthur" title="Jean Arthur">Jean

					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Smith_Goes_to_Washington" title="Mr. Smith Goes to Washington">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</a>
				</i>. Stewart replaced intended star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary
					Cooper</a> in the film about an idealistic man thrown into the political arena.
				Upon the film's October release, it garnered critical praise and became a box office
				success. For his performance, Stewart was nominated for the first of five <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Best Actor</a>. Even after this great
				success, Stewart's parents were still trying to talk him into leaving Hollywood and
				its sinful ways and to return to his home town to lead a decent life. Instead, he
				took a secret trip to Europe to take a break and returned home just as Germany
				invaded Poland.</p>

				less well with the public. <i>Newsweek</i> wrote that they were "perfectly cast in

				distinctive voice on the "Lux Radio Hour," the "Screen Guild Theater" and other
				radio shows. So well known had his slow drawl become that comedians started to
				impersonate him, a form of flattery which continued for most of his life.</p>

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An early interest in flying led Stewart to

					accumulated over 400 hours of flying time.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considered a highly proficient pilot, he

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart enlisted as a private and began

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Public appearances by Stewart were limited

					</i>, appeared nationwide beginning in late May and was very successful,
					resulting in 150,000 new recruits.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart was concerned that his expertise and
					celebrity status would relegate him to instructor duties "behind the lines." His

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">"Still, the war was moving on. For the
					36-year-old Stewart, combat duty seemed far away and unreachable and he had no
					clear plans for the future. But then a rumor that Stewart would be taken off
					flying status and assigned to making training films or selling bonds called for
					his immediate and decisive action, because what he dreaded most was the
					hope-shattering spectre of a dead end." Stewart appealed to his commander, a
					pre-war aviator, who understood the situation and reassigned him to a unit going
					overseas.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In August 1943 he was finally assigned to
					the 445th Bombardment Group at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Gateway_Airport" title="Sioux Gateway Airport">Sioux City AAB</a>, Iowa, first as Operations
					Officer of the 703rd Bombardment Squadron and then as its commander, at the rank

					Nazi-occupied Europe. These missions went <i>uncounted</i> at Stewart's orders.
					His "official" total is listed as 20 and is limited to those with the 445th. In
					1944, he twice received the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_States)" title="Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)">Distinguished Flying

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the beginning of June 1945, Stewart was

					1959. Stewart did not often talk of his wartime service, perhaps due to his
					desire to be seen as a regular soldier doing his duty instead of as a celebrity.
					He did appear on the TV series, <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_At_War" title="The World At War">The World At War</a>

						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Raid_on_Schweinfurt" title="Second Raid on Schweinfurt">Black Thursday</a>
					</i> due to the high casualties it sustained; in total, 60 aircraft were lost
					out of 291 dispatched, as the raid consisting entirely of B-17s was unescorted
					all the way to Schweinfurt and back due to the contemporary escort aircraft
					available lacking the range. Fittingly, he was identified only as "James
					Stewart, Squadron Commander" in the documentary.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He served as Air Force Reserve commander of

					<span class="mw-headline">Plot</span>
				</h2>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On Christmas Eve 1946, George Bailey (James
					Stewart) is deeply depressed, even suicidal. Clarence Odbody, an Angel Second
					Class, is sent to Earth to save him—and thereby earn his wings. Joseph, the head
					angel, is told to review George's life with Clarence.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a 12-year-old boy in 1919, George (Bobby
					Anderson) saved the life of his younger brother Harry from falling through ice,
					though George caught a cold that became an ear infection and left him
					hearing-impaired in one ear. Returning weeks later to his job as errand boy in a
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy" title="Pharmacy">pharmacy</a>, George stopped his boss, local <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druggist" title="Druggist">druggist</a> Mr. Gower (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.B._Warner" title="H.B.

					while grief-stricken over the death of his son from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_influenza_epidemic" title="1918 influenza epidemic">influenza</a>.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From childhood, George's greatest ambition
					has been to see the world and design bridges and skyscrapers. However, George
					repeatedly has to sacrifice his dreams for the well-being of the people of
					Bedford Falls. Four years older than Harry, he puts off going to college to help
					in the family business until Harry graduates from high school and can replace
					him at the Bailey <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_and_loan" title="Building and loan">Building &amp; Loan Association</a>, essential
					to many of the disadvantaged in town. But on Harry's graduation night in 1928,
					as George discusses his future with Mary Hatch (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Reed" title="Donna Reed">Donna
						Reed</a>) — who has had a crush on him since she was a little girl — family
					friends arrive after George and Mary were throwing rocks at an old house to make
					wishes, and break the news to George that his father has had a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke" title="Stroke">stroke</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Potter" title="Mister Potter">Mr.
						Potter</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore" title="Lionel Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a>), a vicious <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumlord" title="Slumlord">slumlord</a>, seizes the opportunity to gain control of the
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Directors" title="Board of Directors">Board of Directors</a> and decides to end the
					"sentimental hogwash" of home loans for the working poor. George persuades the
					board members to stop Potter; they agree, but only on condition that George
					himself run the business. George reluctantly stays in Bedford Falls and gives
					his school money to his brother.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Harry goes on to college, but George's hopes
					of leaving Bedford Falls upon his return are dashed once again when Harry
					unexpectedly brings home a new wife. Her father has offered Harry a job in his
					company too good to turn down. Although Harry offers to do precisely that to
					help his brother, George cannot bring himself to ruin his brother's
					prospects.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">George's mother conspires to set George up
					with Mary, despite Sam Wainwright (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Albertson" title="Frank Albertson">Frank Albertson</a>) supposedly being attracted to her. Sam is an
					insouciant friend of George working in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New
						York City</a>, who has the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase" title="Catchphrase">catchphrase</a> "Hee haw!" George and Mary eventually get married and on
					their wedding day, witness a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run" title="Bank run">run on the
						bank</a> that leaves the Building &amp; Loan in serious danger. Potter,
					sensing another opportunity, offers George's clients "50 cents on the dollar,"
					but George and Mary decide to use the $2000 intended for their honeymoon to lend
					the townspeople what they need to quell the panic until their funds are
					restored. Later, Mary (with the aid of cabbie Ernie and Bert the cop) concocts
					an elaborate mock honeymoon in their new house, the abandoned mansion where they
					had once made wishes. Mary confides to him that this was what she had wished for
					that night.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">George then starts up Bailey Park, an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing" title="Affordable housing">affordable housing</a> project, with bar owner
					Martini and his family as the first homeowners. They and the other residents are
					rescued from paying high rents in the slum the locals have nicknamed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter%27s_field" title="Potter's field">Potter's Field</a>; Potter grouses that their homes
					"are worth twice what [they] cost ... to build." Potter tries to derail the
					competition by tempting George with a job at eight times his current salary,
					$20,000 a year, but George realizes that Potter is trying to bribe him and
					vehemently rejects the offer.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the next several years, George and Mary
					raise a growing family. When <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World
						War II</a> erupts, George is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4F_(military_conscription)" title="4F (military conscription)">unable to enlist</a> due to his bad ear.
					Harry becomes a Navy pilot and is awarded the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a> for shooting down fifteen enemy aircraft, including two

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On Christmas Eve, while on his way to
					deposit $8,000 for the Building &amp; Loan, Uncle Billy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mitchell_(actor)" title="Thomas Mitchell (actor)">Thomas Mitchell</a>) encounters Mr. Potter
					and, bursting with pride, shows him the newspaper article about his nephew
					Harry, about to be honored by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President</a>. Absentmindedly, he
					leaves the deposit envelope with the $8,000 in the folds of the newspaper;
					Potter discovers it later in his office and keeps it. That day, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit" title="Audit">bank examiner</a> is to inspect the Building &amp; Loan's records;
					George discovers Billy's mistake and becomes unhinged while searching the town
					for the money. Returning home, George takes out his anger on his wife and
					children, as well as yelling at the teacher of his youngest daughter for
					allowing her to walk home without a coat — to protect a flower she had received
					— and catch a cold, then after comforting the child by pretending to reattach
					petals to the flower while secretly stashing them in a pocket. Downstairs, he is
					tormented by everything the children do and by the thought that his sacrifices
					have left him unable to provide a safe home for his family. In desperation,
					George tells Potter that <i>he</i> has misplaced the $8,000, and appeals to him
					for a loan to rescue the company. Potter, knowing that Uncle Billy has actually
					misplaced the money, reacts with subtle surprise to George's admission. Potter
					turns George down and, smirking, insults him. Later, George crashes his car into
					a tree during a snowstorm and runs to a nearby bridge, intending to commit
					suicide (being worth more dead than alive, due to a $15,000 insurance policy).
					Before George can leap in, however, Clarence the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel" title="Angel">angel</a> jumps into
					the water. After a shocked George saves him, Clarence reveals himself to be
					George's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_angel" title="Guardian angel">guardian angel</a> and pleads to help him. (In this
					movie, angels are actually <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost" title="Ghost">ghosts</a>, or the
					departed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul" title="Soul">souls</a> of humans, who, if they do some good deed or enough
					good deeds after death, earn their wings — heralded by a bell ringing somewhere
					on earth.)</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">George bitterly wishes he had never been
					born. Clarence then shows him what the town would have been like if George had
					never existed. Bedford Falls is called <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottersville" title="Pottersville">Pottersville</a> and is mostly a slum with Main Street dominated by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_shop" title="Pawn shop">pawn shops</a> and sleazy bars. Bailey Park was never
					built; the land is part of a desolate cemetery. George's home remains a
					run-down, abandoned mansion. George sees the people he knows and loves, but in
					this alternative world where he doesn't exist, none of them recognize him and
					their lives are hard and grim. Mr. Gower was convicted of poisoning the child,
					spent years in prison, and is now an alcoholic reduced to panhandling. Martini
					no longer owns the bar. Ernie and Bert, although still friends, are much darker
					characters, and think George is insane when he claims to know them. Violet is a
					dancer who gets arrested as a pickpocket. Uncle Billy has been in an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insane_asylum" title="Insane asylum">insane asylum</a> for years, while Harry is dead,
					since George was not around to save him when he fell through the ice.
					Consequently, the men Harry would have saved in the war have also perished. His
					mother is a widow running a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_house" title="Boarding house">boarding house</a>, and Mary is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinster" title="Spinster">spinster</a>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Librarian" title="Librarian">librarian</a>; both are lonely, embittered women.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">George returns to the bridge and calls upon
					Clarence and God to let him live again. His prayer is answered and George is
					returned to the moment he met Clarence. Small changes that had occurred while he
					didn't exist, such as his daughter's petals in his pocket, his crashed car, and
					even the weather being windy instead of snowy, are now just as they were, but
					George runs home filled with a new appreciation of what he has accomplished.
					There, he finds that his friends and family have collected a huge amount of
					money to save George and the Building &amp; Loan from scandal and ruin. The
					newly arrived Harry proposes a toast to his brother, "the richest man in town."
					Seeing how many lives he has touched, and the difference he has made to the town
					(and having helped Clarence earn his wings), George Bailey realizes that despite
					his problems, he "really has a wonderful life."</p>

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The original story "The Greatest Gift" was
					written by Philip Van Doren Stern in November 1939. After being unsuccessful in
					getting the story published, he decided to make it into a Christmas card, and
					mailed 200 copies to family and friends in December 1943. The story came to the
					attention of RKO producer David Hempstead, who showed it to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary
						Grant</a>'s Hollywood agent and, in April 1944, RKO Pictures bought the
					rights to the story for $10,000 hoping to turn the story into a vehicle for
					Grant. RKO created three unsatisfactory scripts before shelving the planned
					movie with Grant going on to make another Christmas picture, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bishop%27s_Wife" title="The Bishop's Wife">The Bishop's Wife</a>.</i></p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the suggestion of RKO studio chief
					Charles Koerner, Frank Capra read "The Greatest Gift" and immediately saw its
					potential. RKO, anxious to unload the project, sold the rights in 1945 to
					Capra's production company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Films" title="Liberty Films">Liberty Films</a>, which had a nine-film distribution agreement with RKO,

				in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encino,_California" title="Encino, California">Encino</a>, where "Bedford Falls" was a set covering
				4 acres (16,000 m), assembled from three separate parts with a main street
				stretching 300 yards (three city blocks), with 75 stores and buildings, a tree-lined
				center parkway and 20 full grown oak trees. For months prior to principal
				photography, the mammoth set was populated by pigeons, cats and dogs in order to
				give the "town" a lived-in feel. Due to the requirement to film in an "alternate
				universe" setting as well as during different seasons, the set was extremely
				adaptable. RKO created "chemical snow" for the film in order to preclude the use of
				dubbed dialogue when actors walked across the earlier type of movie snow, made up of
				crushed cornflakes. Filming started on April 15, 1946 and ended on July 27, 1946,
				exactly on deadline for the 90-day principal photography schedule.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RKO ranch in Encino, the filming location of
				Bedford Falls, was razed in the mid-1950s. Because of this there are only two

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> premiered at
					the Globe Theatre in New York on December 20, 1946 to mixed reviews. While Capra
					considered the contemporary critical reviews to be either universally negative

					</i>, complimented some of the actors, including Stewart and Reed, but concluded
					that "the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer's point of view, is the
					sentimentality of it — its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra's nice people are
					charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving
					problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow they all resemble theatrical
					attitudes rather than average realities." One motion picture industry source

					living among bitter, small-minded people. It is a story of being trapped, of
					compromising, of watching others move ahead and away, of becoming so filled with
