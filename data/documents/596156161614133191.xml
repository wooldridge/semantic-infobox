					still suffers from nightmares of combat. Homer had been in the Navy, losing both

					has mechanical hook <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostheses" title="Prostheses">prostheses</a>. Al served as an infantry sergeant in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)" title="25th Infantry Division (United States)">25th Infantry Division</a>,
					fighting in the Pacific.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to the war, Al had worked as a loan
					officer for the Corn Belt Savings and Loan bank in Boone City. Though a mature
					man with a loving family, his patient wife Milly (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrna_Loy" title="Myrna Loy">Myrna
						Loy</a>), adult daughter Peggy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Wright" title="Teresa Wright">Teresa Wright</a>) and son Rob, he has trouble readjusting to civilian
					life, as do his two chance acquaintances.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bank, anticipating an increase in loans
					to returning war veterans, promotes Al to Vice President in charge of the small
					loan department because of his war experience. However, after he approves a
					chancy loan to a veteran, Al's boss Mr. Milton (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Collins_(actor)" title="Ray Collins (actor)">Ray Collins</a>) advises him not to gamble on
					further loans without collateral. At his welcome-home dinner, a slightly-drunk
					Al gives a stirring speech, acknowledging that people will think that the bank
					is gambling with the shareholders' money if he has his way, "And they'll be
					right; we'll be gambling on the future of this country!" Mr. Milton applauds his
					sentiments, but Al remarks later, "He'll back me up wholeheartedly until the
					next time I help some little guy, then I'll have to fight it out again."</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before the war, Fred had been an unskilled
					drugstore <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_jerk" title="Soda jerk">soda jerk</a>, having been raised in a poor neighborhood.
					He does not want to return to his old job, but has no choice, given the stiff
					competition from other returning veterans and his lack of civilian skills. He
					had met Marie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Mayo" title="Virginia Mayo">Virginia Mayo</a>) while in training and married her shortly afterward,
					before shipping out less than a month later. She took a job as a night club
					waitress and set up her own apartment while Fred was overseas. She does not
					relish being married to a soda jerk instead of an officer.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peggy meets and falls in love with Fred, and
					holds Marie in contempt after discovering how shallow and selfish she is. Peggy
					tells her parents she intends to break up Fred and Marie's marriage, only to be
					told that their own marriage overcame similar problems. To protect Peggy, Al
					pressures Fred to break off all contact with his daughter. Fred does so, but the
					friendship between the two men ends.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Homer was a football <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a> before the war. Before leaving to fight, he had become
					engaged to Wilma (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_O%27Donnell" title="Cathy O'Donnell">Cathy O'Donnell</a>). When he returns, both Homer
					and his parents have trouble dealing with his disability. He does not want to
					burden Wilma with a handicapped man, so he pushes her away, although she is the
					one person who has adjusted best to the situation. His uncle Butch (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoagy_Carmichael" title="Hoagy Carmichael">Hoagy Carmichael</a>) owns a bar where the three
					men meet from time to time. Butch counsels Homer, but is careful not to tell his
					nephew what to do.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When an obnoxious soda fountain customer,
					who says that the war was fought against the wrong enemies, gets into an
					altercation with Homer, Fred punches the troublemaker and loses his job. More
					woes follow. After Fred discovers his wife with another man, she demands a

				</i> (1944) and worked hard to get realistic depictions of the combat veterans he
				had encountered. One of the innovative elements he introduced was in asking all the
				principal actors to purchase their own clothes to maintain an affinity for the

					exuding a stifling piety at times, but it works as well as this sort of thing
					can, thanks to accomplished performances by Fredric March, Myrna Loy, and Dana
					Andrews, who keep the human element afloat. Gregg Toland's deep-focus
