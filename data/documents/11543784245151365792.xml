It soon becomes apparent that he is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunslinger" title="Gunslinger">gunslinger</a>, and he finds himself drawn into a conflict between simple <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_principle" title="Homestead principle">homesteader</a> Joe Starrett (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Heflin" title="Van Heflin">Van Heflin</a>) and powerful cattle baron Rufus Ryker (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile_Meyer" title="Emile Meyer">Emile Meyer</a>), who wants to force Starrett and every other homesteader in the valley off the land. Shane accepts a job as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmhand" title="Farmhand">farmhand</a>, but finds Starrett's young son Joey (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_DeWilde" title="Brandon DeWilde">Brandon DeWilde</a>) drawn to him for his strength and skill with a gun. Shane himself is uncomfortably drawn to Starrett's wholesomely charming wife, Marian (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Arthur" title="Jean Arthur">Jean Arthur</a>).</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As tensions mount between the factions, Ryker hires Jack Wilson (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Palance" title="Jack Palance">Jack Palance</a>), a skilled gunslinger. After Wilson kills Frank 'Stonewall' Torrey (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Cook,_Jr." title="Elisha Cook, Jr.">Elisha Cook, Jr.</a>), a hot-tempered homesteader who had stood up to him, Joe Starrett decides to take it upon himself to kill Wilson and Ryker and save the town; however, one of the cowpunchers, who declares that he's "quitting" Ryker, tells Shane that Joe is "up against a stacked deck." Shane stops Joe, and the two men fight over who should go on to face Wilson. Shane regretfully uses his gun to hit Joe over the head and knock him out, knowing this was the only way to prevent Joe from facing Ryker and getting killed. Joey yells at Shane, and then turns to his father. Shane saddles up and rides to the town.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film does not explicitly indicate whether Shane survives the wound he received in the shootout.

Even though she had not made a picture in five years, Arthur accepted the part at the request of George Stevens with whom she had worked in two earlier films, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talk_of_the_Town_(1942_film)" title="The Talk of the Town (1942 film)">The Talk of the Town</a></i> (1942) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_More_the_Merrier" title="The More the Merrier">The More the Merrier</a></i> (1943) for which she received her only <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a> nomination. <i>Shane</i> marked her last film appearance (when the film was shot she was 50 years old, significantly older than her two male costars), although she later appeared in theater and a short-lived television series.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the film was made between July and October 1951, it was not released until 1953 due to director Stevens' extensive editing. The film cost so much to make that at one point, Paramount negotiated its sale to Howard Hughes, who later pulled out of the arrangement. The studio felt the film would never recoup its costs, though it ended up making a significant profit. Another story reported that Paramount was going to release the film as "just another western" until Hughes watched a rough cut of the film and offered to buy it on the spot from Paramount for his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">RKO Radio Pictures</a>. Hughes' offer made Paramount reconsider the film for a major release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jack Palance had problems with horses and Alan Ladd with guns. The scene where Shane practices shooting in front of Joey required 116 takes. A scene where Jack Palance mounts his horse was actually a shot of him dismounting, but played in reverse. As well, the original planned introduction of Wilson galloping into town was replaced with him simply walking in on his horse, which was noted as improving the entrance by making him seem more threatening.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Shane</i> was the first film to be projected in a "flat" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widescreen" title="Widescreen">widescreen</a>, a format that Paramount invented in order to offer audiences something that Television could notâ€”a panoramic screen. Paramount, in conjunction with the management of Radio City Music Hall, installed a screen measuring 50 feet wide by 30 feet high, replacing the Hall's previous screen, which was 34 feet wide by 25 feet high. Although the film's image was shot using the standard 1.37:1 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_ratio" title="Academy ratio">Academy ratio</a>, Paramount picked <i>Shane</i> to debut their new wide-screen system because it was composed largely of long and medium shots that would not be compromised by cropping the image. Using a newly cut aperture plate in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_projector" title="Movie projector">movie projector</a>, as well as a wider-angle lens, the film was exhibited in its first-run venues at an aspect ratio of 1.66:1. Just before the premiere, Paramount announced that all of their films would be shot for this ratio from then on. This was changed in 1954, when the studio changed their house aspect ratio to 1.85:1.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was originally released with a conventional <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound-on-film" title="Sound-on-film">optical soundtrack</a> in April 1953, but the success of the film convinced the producers to re-mix the soundtrack in May with a new three-track, stereophonic soundtrack, which was recorded and played on a 35mm magnetic full coat reel installed by Altec, in interlock on another dubber in the projection booth. This process was new to the general public, only having been debuted in New York City with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_is_Cinerama" title="This is Cinerama">This is Cinerama</a></i> and nationally with Warner Bros. picture, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wax_(1953_film)" title="House of Wax (1953 film)">House of Wax</a></i></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was also one of the first films to attempt to re-create the overwhelming <i>sound</i> of gunfire. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> cited this aspect of <i>Shane</i> as inspiration during the filming of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde_(film)" title="Bonnie and Clyde (film)">Bonnie and Clyde</a>.</i></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, <i>Shane</i> was one of the first films in which actors were attached to hidden wires that yanked them backwards when they were shot from the front. The director George Stevens was in World War II and saw what a single bullet can do to a man.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the mid to late 1970s, the Welsh television station <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTV" title="HTV">HTV</a> Cymru/Wales broadcast a version dubbed into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a> language.</p>

According to <i>Motion Picture Daily</i>, "opening day business at the Music Hall was close to capacity.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crowther called "the concept and the presence" of Joey, the little boy played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_De_Wilde" title="Brandon De Wilde">Brandon De Wilde</a>, as being key to "permit[ting] a refreshing viewpoint on material that's not exactly new.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Shane</i> ended its run at Radio City Music Hall on May 20, 1953, racking up $114,000 in four weeks at Radio City.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clint Eastwood's western <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Rider" title="Pale Rider">Pale Rider</a> pays tribute to "Shane" with a similar plot and similar ending. The movie <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere_to_Run_(1993_film)" title="Nowhere to Run (1993 film)">Nowhere to Run</a> (1993) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Van_Damme" title="Jean-Claude Van Damme">Jean-Claude Van Damme</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosanna_Arquette" title="Rosanna Arquette">Rosanna Arquette</a> was loosely based on "Shane." The 1965 comedy western "Cat Ballou" spoofs "Shane" in various ways. Its buckskin-clad "good" gunfighter Kid Shelleen and black-clad villain Tim Strawn are obviously patterned after Shane and Jack Wilson, respectively, though in "Cat Ballou" the two adversaries turn out to be brothers. The McBain family funeral scene in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Leone" title="Sergio Leone">Sergio Leone</a> epic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_A_Time_In_The_West" title="Once Upon A Time In The West">Once Upon A Time In The West</a> (1968) is borrowed almost shot-for-shot from the funeral scene in "Shane."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 1984 album <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pros_and_Cons_of_Hitch_Hiking" title="The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking">The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</a> by British musician and Pink Floyd founder member Roger Waters references the movie "Shane" extensively.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comedian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hicks" title="Bill Hicks">Bill Hicks</a> referenced the film in his stand-up routine, particularly the scene with Jack Wilson dropping a gun at the feet of a sheep-herder and promptly shooting him.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2006, <i>Shane</i> was the subject of a major legal case in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> involving the expiration of its <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> in Japan. First Trading Corporation had been selling budget-priced copies of public domain movies, including <i>Shane</i>, as Japanese law only protected cinematographic works for 50 years from the year it was publishedâ€”which meant that <i>Shane</i> fell into the public domain in 2003. In a lawsuit filed by Paramount, it was contested that <i>Shane</i> was not in the public domain in Japan due to an amendment which extended the copyright term for these works from 50 to 70 years, and came into effect on January 1, 2004. It was later ruled that the new law was not retroactive, and any film produced during or before 1953 was not eligible for the extension.</p>
