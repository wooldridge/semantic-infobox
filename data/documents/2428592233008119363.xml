The story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, a simple Alabama man who travels across the world, sometimes meeting historical figures, influencing popular culture, and experiencing firsthand historic events of the late 20th century.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film differs substantially from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Groom" title="Winston Groom">Winston Groom</a>'s novel on which it was based. Filming took place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate the protagonist into archived footage and to develop other scenes. An extensive soundtrack was featured in the film, and its commercial release made it one of the top selling albums of all time.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Released in the United States on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="07-06"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_6" title="July 6">July 6</a></span>, 1994, <i>Forrest Gump</i> was well received by critics and became a commercial success as the top grossing film in North America released that year. The film earned over $677 million worldwide during its theatrical run. The film garnered multiple awards and nominations, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe Awards</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Choice_Awards" title="People's Choice Awards">People's Choice Awards</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Artist_Awards" title="Young Artist Awards">Young Artist Awards</a>, among others. Since the film's release, varying interpretations have been made of the film's protagonist and its political symbolism. In 1996, a themed restaurant opened based on the film, and has since expanded to multiple locations worldwide. The scene of Gump <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_persons_who_have_walked_across_the_United_States" title="List of persons who have walked across the United States">running across the country</a> is often referred to when real life people attempt the feat.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1981, Forrest Gump begins to tell the story of his life to a woman who is sitting next to him at a bus stop in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia" title="Savannah, Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a>. As his story progresses, the listeners at the bus stop change regularly throughout his narration, each showing a different attitude ranging from disbelief and indifference to great interest and fascination.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Forrest has well below average intelligence, his mother is able to get him into a public school. On his first day of school, he meets a girl named Jenny whose life at times is followed in parallel to Forrest's. Having discarded his leg braces, (used to straighten his spine) his ability to run incredibly fast gets him into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</a> on a football scholarship. He becomes a star quarterback and ends up with the rest of the team going to the white house and meeting President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F_Kennedy" title="John F Kennedy">John F Kennedy</a>. After his college graduation, he enlists in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">army</a>. There he makes friends with Bubba, who convinces him to enter the shrimping business with him when the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> is over. He also meets Jenny again, when he sees her in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> magazine. He then goes to find her and discovers that she is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripper" title="Stripper">stripper</a> working at a bar. He goes to the bar and attacks two customers who give her trouble. In 1967, Forrest and Bubba are sent to Vietnam, and after several months of patrolling with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)" title="9th Infantry Division (United States)">9th Infantry Division</a> their platoon is attacked. Though Forrest rescues many of the men in his unit, Bubba is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killed_in_action" title="Killed in action">killed in action</a>, and Lt. Dan Taylor, the platoon's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer" title="Commanding officer">commanding officer</a>, is wounded in both legs, requiring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation" title="Amputation">amputation</a>. Forrest is wounded during the battle, and is awarded the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a> for his heroism.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forrest discovers an uncanny ability for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_pong" title="Ping pong">ping pong</a> while in recovery for the bullet wound in his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks" title="Buttocks">buttocks</a>. He starts playing for the U.S. Army team, gaining popularity and rising to celebrity status. He eventually plays competitively against Chinese teams and wins against the Chinese. At an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C. Forrest reunites with Jenny, who has been living a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie" title="Hippie">hippie</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a> lifestyle while Forrest was away and is engaged to another man. The other man appeared to be abusive towards Jenny. As Forrest witnesses the man slapping Jenny after a short arguement. An enraged Forrest attacks the man in order to defend Jenny (Which is an instinct he has gained long ago when he got to know her).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon leaving military service and returning home, Forrest accepts an offer to endorse a company that makes ping pong paddles in exchange for an endorsement fee of $25,000. He uses the money to buy a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimping" title="Shrimping">shrimping</a> boat and fulfill his wartime promise to Bubba. His commanding officer from Vietnam, Lieutenant Dan, joins him as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_mate" title="First mate">first mate</a> to fulfill a promise he jokingly made to Forrest some time before. Initially Forrest has little success, but after finding his is the only surviving boat in the area after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Carmen" title="Hurricane Carmen">Hurricane Carmen</a> hits the Gulf states, he begins to pull in huge amounts of shrimp. He buys an entire fleet of shrimp boats, and "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Gump_Shrimp_Company" title="Bubba Gump Shrimp Company">Bubba Gump</a>" shrimp becomes a household name. He returns home when his mother falls ill; she dies soon afterward. Lt. Dan takes over operations of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company and invests the earnings in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer" title="Apple Computer">"some sort of a fruit company"</a> and Forrest, Dan and Bubba's families become financially secure for the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1976, Jenny returns to visit Forrest, and after some time he proposes marriage to her. She declines, though feels obliged to prove her love to him by sleeping with him. She leaves early the next morning. On a whim, Forrest elects to go for a run. Seemingly capriciously, he decides to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_persons_who_have_walked_across_the_United_States" title="List of persons who have walked across the United States">run coast to coast across the country</a> several times, over some three and a half years, becoming famous again.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While finishing his story, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny who, having seen him run on television, asks him to visit her. Once he is reunited with Jenny, Forrest discovers she has a young son, also named Forrest, and Jenny says Forrest is the boy's father. Jenny tells Forrest she is suffering and dying from an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" title="AIDS">unknown virus</a> which has no known cure. Together, the three move back to Greenbow, Alabama where Jenny and Forrest finally marry. Jenny dies soon afterward, leaving their son in Forrest's care. Forrest talks to Jenny's grave and tells her how well their son is doing in school. On his son's first day of school, Forrest sits with him at the school bus stop. Forrest's first bus driver is shown to also be his son's first bus driver as the movie concludes.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film is based on the 1986 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump_(novel)" title="Forrest Gump (novel)">novel</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Groom" title="Winston Groom">Winston Groom</a>. Both center around the character of Forrest Gump. However, the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the novel with the founding of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and the meeting with Forrest, Jr. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the country.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gump's core character and personality are also changed from the novel; among other things his film character is an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savant_syndrome" title="Savant syndrome">autistic savant</a>â€”while playing football at the university, he fails craft and gym, but receives a perfect score in an advanced physics class he is enrolled in by his coach to satisfy his college requirements.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The story was commended by several critics. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i> wrote, "I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like Forrest Gump. Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream...The screenplay by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Roth" title="Eric Roth">Eric Roth</a> has the complexity of modern fiction...[Hanks'] performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths....what a magical movie." Todd McCarthy of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> wrote that the film "...has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop." In addition, the film received notable pans from several major reviewers. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Lane" title="Anthony Lane">Anthony Lane</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i> called the film "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell." Owen Gordinier of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> said that the film "...reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_America" title="Disney's America">Disney's America</a>."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Critics had mixed views on the main character.

Peter Chomo writes that Gump acts as a "...social mediator and as an agent of redemption in divided times". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Travers" title="Peter Travers">Peter Travers</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> called Gump "...everything we admire in the American character â€” honest, brave, loyal...". <i>The New York Times</i> reviewer Janet Maslin called Gump a "...hollow man..." who is "...self-congratulatory in his blissful ignorance, warmly embraced as the embodiment of absolutely nothing." Marc Vincenti of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto_Weekly" title="Palo Alto Weekly">Palo Alto Weekly</a></i> called the character "...a pitiful stooge taking the pie of life in the face, thoughtfully licking his fingers."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film is commonly seen as a polarizing one for audiences, with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> writing in 2004, "Nearly a decade after it earned gazillions and swept the Oscars, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zemeckis" title="Robert Zemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a>'s ode to 20th-century <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">America</a> still represents one of cinema's most clearly drawn lines in the sand. One half of folks see it as an artificial piece of pop melodrama, while everyone else raves that it's sweet as a box of chocolates."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Produced on a budget of $55 million, <i>Forrest Gump</i> opened in 1,595Â theaters in its first weekend of domestic release, earning $24,450,602. Motion picture business consultant and screenwriter Jeffrey Hilton suggested to producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Finerman" title="Wendy Finerman">Wendy Finerman</a> to double the P&amp;A (film marketing budget) based on his viewing of an early print of the film.

The film placed first in the weekend's box office, narrowly beating <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King" title="The Lion King">The Lion King</a></i>, which was in its fourth week of release. For the first ten weeks of its release, the film held the number one position at the box office.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film took 66Â days to surpass $250 million and was the fastest grossing Paramount film to pass $100 million, $200 million, and $300 million in box office receipts (at the time of its release). The film had gross receipts of $329,694,499 in the U.S. and Canada and $347,693,217 in international markets for a total of $677,387,716 worldwide.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Forrest Gump</i> was first released on VHS on April 27, 1995, before being released on a two-disc DVD on August 28, 2001.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Groom" title="Winston Groom">Winston Groom</a> was paid $350,000 for the screenplay rights to his novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump_(novel)" title="Forrest Gump (novel)">Forrest Gump</a></i> and was contracted for a 3% share of the film's net profits. However, Paramount and the film's producers did not pay him, using <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting" title="Hollywood accounting">Hollywood accounting</a> to posit that the blockbuster film lost moneyâ€”a claim belied by the fact that Tom Hanks contracted for the film's gross receipts instead of a salary, and he and director Zemeckis each netted $40 million.

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Symbolism">Symbolism</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Various interpretations have been suggested for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of <i>The New York Times</i> noted several opinions that were made about the feather: "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?" Hanks interpreted the feather as: "Our destiny is only defined by how we deal with the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: "It can mean so many things to so many different people."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Tom Hanks' words, "The film is non-political and thus non-judgmental". Nevertheless, in 1994, CNN's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfire_(TV_series)" title="Crossfire (TV series)">Crossfire</a></i> debated whether the film promoted conservative values or was an indictment of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a> movement of the 1960s. Thomas Byers, in a <i>Modern Fiction Studies</i> article, called the film "an aggressively conservative film".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been noted that while Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Curran's life is full of countercultural embrace, complete with drug usage and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of tongue-in-cheek reconciliation. Jennifer Hyland Wang argued in a <i>Cinema Journal</i> article that Curran's death to an unnamed virus "...symbolizes the death of liberal America and the death of the protests that defined a decade [1960s]." She also notes that the film's screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Roth" title="Eric Roth">Eric Roth</a>, when developing the screenplay from the novel, had "...transferred all of Gump's flaws and most of the excesses committed by Americans in the '60s and '70s to her [Curran]."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other commentators believe that the film forecast the 1994 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Revolution" title="Republican Revolution">Republican Revolution</a> and used the image of Forrest Gump to promote his traditional, conservative values. Wang argued that the film was used by Republican politicians to illustrate a "traditional version of recent history" to gear voters towards their ideology for the congressional elections. In addition, presidential candidate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dole" title="Bob Dole">Bob Dole</a> cited the film's message in influencing his campaign due to its "...message that has made [the film] one of Hollywood's all-time greatest box office hits: no matter how great the adversity, the American Dream is within everybody's reach."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1995, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review" title="National Review">National Review</a></i> included <i>Forrest Gump</i> in its list of the "Best 100 Conservative Movies" of all time. Then, in 2009, the magazine ranked the film number four on its 25 Best <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative" title="Conservative">Conservative</a> Movies of the Last 25 Years list. "Tom Hanks plays the title character, an amiable dunce who is far too smart to embrace the lethal values of the 1960s. The love of his life, wonderfully played by Robin Wright Penn, chooses a different path; she becomes a drug-addled hippie, with disastrous results."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Others have interpreted the movie as adding to a discourse of race through the changing contours of white power and privilege during the civil rights era. From the standpoint that studies of whiteness work to dislodge whites from positions of power, Robyn Weigman has argued that Forrest Gump is a "filmic celebration of fundamental white goodness." For example, when George Wallace fails to keep blacks out of the University of Alabama, Gump "symbolically joins the students when he retrieves one of their dropped books," though it is an innocent gesture. His innocent alignment with desegregation coupled with his attributes as a quintessential whiteâ€”his name being that of Bedford Forrest, Ku Klux Klan leaderâ€”leads Weigman to conclude that the movie works to split "whiteness" from the white body, as "white power and privilege are displaced from any inherent relation--historically, ideologically, politically--to white skin."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 32-song soundtrack from the film was released on July 6, 1994.

Music producer Joel Sill reflected on compiling the soundtrack: "We wanted to have very recognizable material that would pinpoint time periods, yet we didn't want to interfere with what was happening cinematically." The two-disc album has a variety of music from the 1950sâ€“1980s performed by American artists. According to Sills, this was due to Zemeckis' request, "All the material in there is American. Bob (Zemeckis) felt strongly about it. He felt that Forrest wouldn't buy anything but American."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The soundtrack reached a peak of second place on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_charts" title="Billboard charts"><i>Billboard</i> charts</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film inspired a seafood restaurant called Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, named for the shrimping company formed by Gump in the film, named for himself and his friend, Bubba.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A screenplay based on the original novel's sequel, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gump_and_Co." title="Gump and Co.">Gump and Co.</a></i>, was written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Roth" title="Eric Roth">Eric Roth</a> in 2001.

After the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks" title="September 11 attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, Roth, Zemeckis, and Hanks decided the story was no longer "relevant". In March 2007, however, it was reported that Paramount producers took another look at the screenplay.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the very first page of the sequel novel, Forrest Gump tells readers "Don't never let nobody make a movie of your life's story," though "Whether they get it right or wrong, it don't matter." The first chapter of the book suggests that the real life events surrounding the film have been incorporated into Forrest's storyline, and that Forrest got a lot of media attention as a result of the film. During the course of the sequel novel, Gump runs into Tom Hanks, and at the end of the novel is the film's release, including Gump going on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_David_Letterman_Show" title="The David Letterman Show">The David Letterman Show</a></i> and attending the Academy Awards.
