      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1977 Duvall returned to Broadway to appear as Walter Cole in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet" title="David Mamet">David Mamet</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Buffalo_(play)" title="American Buffalo (play)">American Buffalo</a></i>.

To date, Duvall has not returned to the New York stage.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Duvall continued to appear in important films during the 1980s, including the roles of cynical sportswriter Max Mercy in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Natural_(film)" title="The Natural (film)">The Natural</a></i> (1984) and Los Angeles police officer Bob Hodges in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_(film)" title="Colors (film)">Colors</a></i> (1988).

Foote was rumored to have written the part for Duvall, who had always wanted to play a country singer and contributed ideas for the character. Foote denied this, claiming he found it too constraining to write roles for specific actors, but he did hope Duvall would be cast. Duvall was said to have written the music, but the actor said he wrote only a few "background, secondary songs." Duvall did do his own singing, insisting it be added to his contract that he sing the songs himself; Duvall said, "What's the point if you're not going to do your own (singing)? They're just going to dub somebody else? I mean, there's no point to that."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tess_Harper" title="Tess Harper">Tess Harper</a>, who co-starred, said Duvall inhabited the character so fully that she only got to know Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Beresford" title="Bruce Beresford">Bruce Beresford</a>, too, said the transformation was so believable to him that he could feel his skin crawling up the back of his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, "Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny." Nevertheless, Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1989, Duvall appeared in the landmark mini-series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonesome_Dove" title="Lonesome Dove">Lonesome Dove</a></i> in the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_%22Gus%22_McCrae" title="Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; McCrae">Augustus "Gus" McCrae</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In late August 1945, as the movie opens, Don Vito Corleone (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>) hears requests for favors during the Don's daughter Connie's wedding reception, while his adopted son <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hagen" title="Tom Hagen">Tom Hagen</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duvall" title="Robert Duvall">Robert Duvall</a>) listens. Singer Johnny Fontane (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Martino" title="Al Martino">Al Martino</a>), Corleone's godson, asks for help in landing a movie role that will revitalize his flagging career. Hagen is dispatched to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> to meet with studio head Jack Woltz (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marley" title="John Marley">John Marley</a>) to ensure Fontane gets his desired role. After initially refusing to cast Fontane, Woltz caves in when he finds the severed head of his prized racehorse "Khartoum" in his bed the next morning.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon Hagen's return, the family leadership meets with "The Turk" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Sollozzo" title="Virgil Sollozzo">Virgil Sollozzo</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Lettieri" title="Al Lettieri">Al Lettieri</a>), who asks Don Corleone to protect the rival Tattaglia family's planned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin" title="Heroin">heroin</a> business. Don Vito disapproves of drug trafficking and feels his political influence could be jeopardized, so he rejects the potentially lucrative proposal. He then sends his primary enforcer, Luca Brasi (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Montana" title="Lenny Montana">Lenny Montana</a>), to find out more about Sollozzo's organization, but Brasi is stabbed in the hand by Sollozzo and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrote" title="Garrote">garroted</a> to death.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Don Corleone is shot five times in the back at a fruit stand in an assassination attempt. Sollozzo abducts Hagen and persuades him to offer Corleone's eldest son, Sonny (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caan_(actor)" title="James Caan (actor)">James Caan</a>), the deal previously offered to the Don. The youngest son, Michael (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>), whom the other <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia" title="American Mafia">Mafia</a> families consider a "civilian" uninvolved in mob business, averts a second murder attempt at the hospital where his father is being treated, but his jaw is broken by corrupt <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_American" title="Irish American">Irish American</a> police Captain McCluskey (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Hayden" title="Sterling Hayden">Sterling Hayden</a>). Sonny retaliates by having Don Philip Tattaglia's son, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Tattaglia" title="Bruno Tattaglia">Bruno</a>, killed.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sollozzo and McCluskey meet with Michael at a local <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Italy" title="Cuisine of Italy">Italian</a> restaurant in an attempt to settle the dispute. Michael pretends he needs to use the bathroom, and following a plan he initiated, retrieves a gun hidden there. Michael returns to the table and kills both Sollozzo and McCluskey. He leaves the country and takes refuge in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>, where he soon marries a young local woman named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonia_Vitelli-Corleone" title="Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone">Apollonia Vitelli</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonetta_Stefanelli" title="Simonetta Stefanelli">Simonetta Stefanelli</a>). The third Corleone brother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredo_Corleone" title="Fredo Corleone">Fredo</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cazale" title="John Cazale">John Cazale</a>), is sent to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_metropolitan_area" title="Las Vegas metropolitan area">Las Vegas</a> where he is sheltered by casino operators the Corleones financially back. Open warfare soon erupts between the Corleones and the other members of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Families_(The_Godfather)" title="Five Families (The Godfather)">Five Families</a>, while the police and other authorities begin to clamp down on Mafia activity. Don Vito is particularly distressed when he learns of Michael's involvement, since he had planned for Michael to remain uninvolved in the "family business."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sonny impulsively leaves the guarded family compound to confront Carlo (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Russo" title="Gianni Russo">Gianni Russo</a>) who has been abusing Connie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talia_Shire" title="Talia Shire">Talia Shire</a>). Sonny beats Carlo on the street and threatens to kill him if he ever touches Connie again. Later, Carlo beats Connie again, and upon getting her phone call, Sonny leaves the compound again. En route, he is ambushed and killed at a toll booth. Meanwhile, Michael narrowly escapes death in Sicily when his wife is killed by a car bomb.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Don Vito meets with the other Five Family dons and settles their dispute, withdrawing his opposition to the Tattaglia's heroin business. He deduces from the negotiations that the Tattaglias were acting on behalf of the more powerful Don Barzini (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Conte" title="Richard Conte">Richard Conte</a>). With his safety now guaranteed, Michael returns home. More than a year later, he marries his long time American girlfriend, Kay Adams (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a>). As his father withdraws from active control of the Corleone family, and as middle brother Fredo is seen as incapable of shouldering the Don's responsibilities, Michael takes control of the family and its business. He promises Kay he will legitimize its businesses within five years.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biding his time, Michael allows rival families to pressure Corleone enterprises and eat away at their revenues, disturbing several of his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caporegime" title="Caporegime">caporegimes</a>. He directs them not to retaliate, disclosing plans to move family operations to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> while spinning off New York operations to family members who stay behind. Michael chooses Carlo to go to Vegas and replaces Hagen with his father as his consigliere; Vito explains to the upset Hagen that he and Michael have longer-range plans for him and for the family.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Michael travels to Las Vegas, intending to buy out their casino partner, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_Greene" title="Moe Greene">Moe Greene</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rocco" title="Alex Rocco">Alex Rocco</a>). Greene angrily rejects the proposal, deriding the Corleones as a failing organization. Michael is particularly angered when Fredo, under the sway of Greene and his associates, warns his brother that Greene is too important to be treated in that fashion.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vito Corleone collapses and dies while playing with his young grandson <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Corleone" title="Anthony Corleone">Anthony</a> in his tomato garden. At the burial, caporegime Tessio (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe_Vigoda" title="Abe Vigoda">Abe Vigoda</a>) arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, now seen as the dominant figure in the New York families. As Vito had warned Michael, Tessio's involvement signals his shift of allegiance to the Barzini family; the planned meeting is intended to result in Michael's assassination. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie and Carlo's son, where Michael will stand as his godfather.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Francis Ford Coppola was not the first choice to direct. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italian</a> director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Leone" title="Sergio Leone">Sergio Leone</a> was offered the job first, but he declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_America" title="Once Upon a Time in America">Once Upon a Time in America</a></i>, which focused on Jewish-American gangsters. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> was then approached but he also declined the offer and made <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Up,_Doc%3F_(film)" title="What's Up, Doc? (film)">What's Up, Doc?</a></i> instead. According to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Evans_(film_producer)" title="Robert Evans (film producer)">Robert Evans</a>, head of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence, and thus reflect poorly on his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian-American" title="Sicilian-American">Sicilian</a> and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office, and he wanted to, in his own words, "smell the spaghetti". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm. At the time, Coppola had directed eight previous films, the most notable of which was the film version of the stage musical <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finian%27s_Rainbow_(film)" title="Finian's Rainbow (film)">Finian's Rainbow</a></i>â€“although he had also received an Academy Award for co-writing <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_(film)" title="Patton (film)">Patton</a></i> in 1970. Coppola was in debt to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> for $400,000 following budget overruns on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138" title="THX 1138">THX 1138</a></i>, which Coppola had produced, and he took <i>The Godfather</i> on Lucas's advice.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was intense friction between Coppola and Paramount, and several times Coppola was almost replaced. Paramount maintains that its skepticism was due to a rocky start to production, though Coppola believes that the first week went extremely well. The studio thought that Coppola failed to stay on schedule, frequently made production and casting errors, and insisted on unnecessary expenses, and two top producers unsuccessfully tried to convince another filmmaker to take Coppola's place. The producers scapegoated the other filmmaker when their attempt to fire Coppola became known. Because the producers told him that the other filmmaker had attempted a coup, Coppola says he was shadowed by a replacement director, who was ready to take over if Coppola was fired, but despite such intense pressure, he managed to defend his decisions and avoid being replaced.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Paramount was in financial trouble at the time of production and was desperate for a "big hit" to boost business, hence the pressure Coppola faced during filming. They wanted <i>The Godfather</i> to appeal to a wide audience and threatened Coppola with a "violence coach" to make the film more exciting. Coppola added a few more violent scenes to keep the studio happy. The scene in which Connie breaks dishes after finding out that her husband is cheating was added for this reason.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coppola's casting choices were unpopular with studio executives at Paramount Pictures, particularly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a> as Don Vito Corleone. Coppola's first two choices for the role were both Brando and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, but Olivier's agent refused the role saying "Lord Olivier is not taking any jobs. He's very sick. He's gonna die soon and he's not interested" (Olivier lived 18 years after the refusal). Paramount, which wanted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Borgnine" title="Ernest Borgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a>, originally refused to allow Coppola to cast Brando in the role, citing difficulties Brando had on recent film sets. One studio executive proposed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Thomas" title="Danny Thomas">Danny Thomas</a> for the role citing the fact that Don Corleone was a strong "family man." At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that "Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test, and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets). Coppola chose Brando over Borgnine on the basis of his screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> for his portrayal, which he refused to accept.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studio originally wanted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a> or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_O%27Neal" title="Ryan O'Neal">Ryan O'Neal</a> to play <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Corleone" title="Michael Corleone">Michael Corleone</a>, but Coppola wanted an unknown who looked like an Italian-American, whom he found in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>. Pacino was not well known at the time, having appeared in only two minor films, and the studio did not consider him right for the part, in part because of his height. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sheen" title="Martin Sheen">Martin Sheen</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caan_(actor)" title="James Caan (actor)">James Caan</a> also auditioned. At one point, Caan was the first choice to play Michael, while <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine_Caridi" title="Carmine Caridi">Carmine Caridi</a> was signed as elder brother Sonny. Pacino was given the role only after Coppola threatened to quit the production; Caan stated that Coppola envisioned Michael to be the Sicilian-looking one and Sonny was the Americanized version. The studio agreed to Pacino on the condition that Caan was cast as Sonny instead of Caridi, despite the former's Jewish heritage and the latter closely matching the character in the novel (a six-foot-four, black-haired Italian-American bull). Coppola and Puzo would subsequently create a role for Caridi in the sequels.</p>

De Niro later played the young Vito Corleone in <i>Part II</i>, winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for the role.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To some extent, the film was a family affair for Francis Ford Coppola. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine_Coppola" title="Carmine Coppola">Carmine Coppola</a>, his father, who had a distinguished career as a composer, conductor and arranger, wrote additional music for the film and appeared in a bit part as a piano player, and Carmine's wife, Italia Coppola, was an extra. The director's sister, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talia_Shire" title="Talia Shire">Talia Shire</a>, was cast as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Corleone" title="Connie Corleone">Connie Corleone</a>, and his infant daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Coppola" title="Sofia Coppola">Sofia</a>, played Connie's and Carlo's newborn son, Michael Francis Rizzi, in the climactic baptism scene near the movie's end. Coppola also cast his sons as Tom Hagen's sons, Frank and Andrew. They are seen in the Sonny-Carlo street fight scene and behind Pacino and Duvall during the funeral scene.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Al Pacino, James Caan and Diane Keaton each received $35,000 for their work on <i>The Godfather</i>, and Robert Duvall got $36,000 for eight weeks of work. Marlon Brando was paid $50,000 for six weeks and weekly expenses of $1,000, plus 5% of the film, capped at $1.5 million. Brando later sold his points back to Paramount for $300,000.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the movie's most shocking moments involved the real severed head of a horse. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a> groups protested the inclusion of the scene. Coppola later stated that the horse's head was delivered to him from a dog food company; a horse had not been killed specifically for the movie. This scene was shot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Washington,_New_York" title="Port Washington, New York">Port Washington, New York</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the novel, Jack Woltz, the movie producer whose horse's head is put in his bed, is also shown to be a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia" title="Pedophilia">pedophile</a> as Tom Hagen sees a young girl (presumably one of Woltz's child stars) crying while walking out of Woltz's room. This scene was cut from the theatrical release but can be found on the DVD (though Woltz can still briefly be seen kissing the girl on the cheek in his studio in the film).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The shooting of Moe Greene through the eye was inspired by the death of gangster <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugsy_Siegel" title="Bugsy Siegel">Bugsy Siegel</a>. To achieve the effect, actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rocco" title="Alex Rocco">Alex Rocco</a>'s glasses had two tubes hidden in their frames. One had fake blood in it, and the other had a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB_gun#Ammunition" title="BB gun">BB</a> and compressed air. When the gun was shot, the compressed air shot the BB through the glasses, shattering them from the inside. The other tube then released the fake blood.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The opening scene of <i>The Godfather</i> is a long, slow zoom, starting with a close-up of the undertaker, Bonasera, who is petitioning Don Corleone, and ending with the Godfather, seen from behind, framing the scene. This zoom, which lasts for about three minutes, was shot with a computer-controlled zoom lens designed by Tony Karp. The lens was also used in the making of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running" title="Silent Running">Silent Running</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Locations around New York City and its environs were used for the film, including the then-closed flagship store of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_%26_Co." title="Best &amp; Co.">Best &amp; Company</a> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Avenue" title="Fifth Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>, which was dressed up and used for the scene in which Pacino and Keaton are Christmas shopping.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous gangster movies had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider. In contrast, <i>The Godfather</i> presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society. Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering. The setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping, considered an important part of the film's appeal. ("You can act like a man!", Don Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane.)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Real-life gangsters responded enthusiastically to the film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatore_Gravano" title="Salvatore Gravano">Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano</a>, the former Underboss in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambino_crime_family" title="Gambino crime family">Gambino crime family</a>, stated: "I left the movie stunned...

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The novel and film also differ on the fates of Michael's bodyguards in Sicily, Fabrizio and Calo. The film has them both surviving (Calo, in fact, appears in the third installment). In the book, however, it is stated that Calo dies along with Apollonia in the car explosion, and Fabrizio, implicated as an accomplice in the bombing, is shot and killed as one more victim in the famous "baptism scene" after he is tracked down running a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_parlor" title="Pizza parlor">pizza parlor</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo</a>.

This was even more the case with <i>The Godfather Part II</i>, and the success of those two films, critically, artistically and financially, opened the doors for more and varied depictions of mobster life, including films such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodfellas" title="Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></i> and TV series such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chase" title="David Chase">David Chase</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos" title="The Sopranos">The Sopranos</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The image of the Mafia as being a feudal organization with the Don being both the protector of the small fry and the collector of obligations from them to repay his services, which <i>The Godfather</i> helped to popularize, is now an easily recognizable cultural <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature)" title="Trope (literature)">trope</a>, as is that of the Don's family as a "royal family". (This has spread into the real world as wellÂ â€“ cf. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gotti" title="John Gotti">John Gotti</a> Â â€“ the "Dapper Don", and his celebritized family.) This portrayal stands in contrast to the more sordid reality of lower level Mafia "familial" entanglements, as depicted in various post-<i>Godfather</i> Mafia fare, such as Scorsese's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Streets" title="Mean Streets">Mean Streets</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_(film)" title="Casino (film)">Casino</a></i>, and also to the grittier <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" title="Film noir">hard-boiled</a> pre-<i>Godfather</i> films.</p>

One dream scene is almost a shot by shot replica of the attempted assassination of Vito Corleone (Crystal playing the Don and De Niro playing Fredo). In the 1990 comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freshman_(1990_film)" title="The Freshman (1990 film)">The Freshman</a></i>, Marlon Brando plays a role reminiscent of Don Corleone.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1975, Coppola edited <i>The Godfather</i> and <i>The Godfather Part II</i> together for TV, putting the scenes in chronological order and adding some previously unseen footage, but also toning down the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence" title="Violence">violence</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex" title="Sex">sex</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity" title="Profanity">profanity</a>. It is rated TV-14. This version of the story was called <i>The Godfather Saga</i>. In 1981, Paramount released the <i>Godfather Epic</i> box set which combined parts I &amp; II in chronological order, again with additional scenes not shown in theaters. In 1992, Coppola would again re-edit all three <i>Godfather</i> movies (<i>The Godfather</i>, <i>The Godfather Part II</i> and <i>The Godfather Part III</i>) in chronological order dubbed <i>The Godfather Trilogy 1901-1980</i>. It was released on VHS and laserdisc in 1993 but has yet (as of 2008) to appear on DVD. The total run time for this version is 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes). This version spanned five VHS tapes and incorporated new previously deleted scenes that had not been seen in <i>The Godfather Saga</i>. This set also included a sixth VHS tape: "The Godfather Family: A Look Inside" a making-of documentary.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">None of these releases contains all the additional scenes in one package. The <i>Saga</i> contains scenes not in the <i>Epic</i> or <i>Trilogy</i>, the <i>Epic</i> contains scenes not in the <i>Saga</i> or <i>Trilogy</i>, and the <i>Trilogy</i> contains scenes not in the <i>Saga</i> or the <i>Epic</i>. Fans have longed for a complete release of the entire series though Francis Ford Coppola has stated that the films were meant to be seen in their original form and has not agreed (as of 2008) to a chronological release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Godfather</i> was released on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> for the first time on October 9, 2001 as part of a DVD package called <i>The Godfather DVD Collection</i>. The collection contained all three films with commentary from Francis Ford Coppola and a bonus disc that featured a 73-minute documentary from 1991 titled <i>The Godfather Family: A Look Inside</i>, plus a 1971 documentary. The package also contained deleted footage, including the additional scenes originally contained in <i>The Godfather Saga</i>; "Francis Coppola's Notebook" a look inside a notebook the director kept with him at all times during the production of the film; rehearsal footage; and video segments on Gordon Willis's cinematography, Nino Rota's and Carmine Coppola's music, Francis Ford Coppola, locations and Mario Puzo's screenplays. The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a "Godfather" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The restoration was confirmed by Francis Ford Coppola during a question-and-answer session for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_III" title="The Godfather Part III">The Godfather Part III</a></i>, when he said that he had just seen the new transfer and it was "terrific".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a careful restoration of the aging first two movies, <i>The Godfather</i> movies were released on DVD and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc" title="Blu-ray Disc">Blu-ray</a> on September 23, 2008 under the title <i>The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration</i>. The work was done by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Harris" title="Robert A. Harris">Robert A. Harris</a> of the Film Preserve. The Blu-ray box set (four discs) includes high-definition extra features on the restoration and film. They are included on disc 5 of the DVD box set (five discs).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other extras are ported over from Paramount's 2001 DVD release. There are slight differences between the repurposed extras on the DVD and Blu-ray sets, with the HD box having more content.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new DVD boxset was released on June 2, 2008 in Europe. It has been rerated as a "15" by the BBFC. It is unclear whether a chronological box set will be released.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Coppola restoration on Blu-ray (2008), the end credit theme music for <i>The Godfather Part II</i> is missing the final chord (approximately 10 seconds) from the film proper. This missing chord would be located immediately before the restoration credit music begins. Robert A. Harris has not publicly commented about this.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Godfather</i>, along with the other films in the trilogy, had a strong impact on the public at large. Don Vito Corleone's line "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse" was voted as the second most memorable line in cinema history in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Movie_Quotes" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes">AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes</a> by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An indication of the continuing influence of <i>The Godfather</i> and its sequels can be gleaned from the many references to it which have appeared in every medium of popular culture in the decades since the film's initial release.

In the television show <i>The Sopranos</i>, Tony Soprano's topless bar is named Bada Bing after the line in <i>The Godfather</i> when Sonny says, "You've gotta get up close like this and bada-bing! You blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit."</p>
