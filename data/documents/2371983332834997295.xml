Her boyfriend Johnny Cammareri (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Aiello" title="Danny Aiello">Danny Aiello</a>) proposes marriage one night at dinner, on his knees in a good suit and Loretta accepts. That evening Johnny asks Loretta to invite his younger brother Ronny to come to the wedding. He leaves for Italy to attend his dying mother. Upon hearing the news of Loretta's engagement that night, her father Cosmo (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Gardenia" title="Vincent Gardenia">Vincent Gardenia</a>) voices his disapproval, reminding Loretta that her first husband died because she brings bad luck to a union, while her mother Rose (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_Dukakis" title="Olympia Dukakis">Olympia Dukakis</a>) seems resigned to the idea and relieved that Loretta is not in love with bumbling Johnny.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The next morning Loretta (after being cut off on the phone) visits Ronny at his bakery and tenders the wedding invitation. Younger brother Ronny (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage" title="Nicolas Cage">Nicolas Cage</a>), tells Loretta how he lost his hand in a bread slicer, blaming his brother for distracting him and causing the accident. His maiming resulted in his fiancÃ©e leaving him. They proceed to talk about their unhappy lives and bad luck and eventually end up in his apartment above the bakery shop. Their mutual attraction for each other takes over, and they make love. The next morning, Loretta feels ashamed of herself. She says she will never see Ronny again and they must never tell anyone what they did. However, Ronny has fallen in love with Loretta, and when he asks her on a date to put the two things he loves most, opera and Loretta together for one evening at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera" title="Metropolitan Opera">opera</a>, she agrees. Loretta makes a call at the deli and explains that she is in a hurry and will make that day's deposit at the bank. Walking down the street she pops into a beauty shop for a makeover. No more gray, organized curls, plucked eyebrows and a great makeup job. Next she buys a stunning evening gown, and red shoes to match. Catcalls and stares follow her home to an empty house. She muses over her new outfit and spends the early evening getting ready for Ronny and the opera.</p>
