	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figgis was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle,_Cumbria" title="Carlisle, Cumbria">Carlisle</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and grew up in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Figgis for several years had a relationship with the actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_Burrows" title="Saffron Burrows">Saffron Burrows</a> and cast her in several films. He is cousin to Irish filmmakers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Figgis" title="Jonathan Figgis">Jonathan Figgis</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Figgis" title="Jason Figgis">Jason Figgis</a> who run the award-winning film production company <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Eleven_Pictures" title="October Eleven Pictures">October Eleven Pictures</a> in Ireland. His sons Arlen Figgis and Louis Figgis have also followed their father in to the film industry, as editor and producer respectively.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figgis's early interest was in music and he played keyboards for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ferry" title="Bryan Ferry">Bryan Ferry</a>'s first band. In 1983 he directed a theatre play, produced in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theatre_Gerard-Philipe&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Theatre Gerard-Philipe (page does not exist)">Theatre Gerard-Philipe</a> (Saint-Denis, Paris, France). This play performed with great success at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Festival_de_Grenada&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Festival de Grenada (page does not exist)">Festival de Grenada</a> and in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theater_der_Welt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Theater der Welt (page does not exist)">Theater der Welt</a> (Munich, Germany).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After working in theatre (he was a musician and performer in the experimental group <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Show" title="People Show">People Show</a>) he made his feature film debut with the low budget <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Monday" title="Stormy Monday">Stormy Monday</a></i> in 1988. The film earned him attention as a director who could get interesting performances from established <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> actors. He initially made a splash in America in the 1990s with the gritty thriller <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Affairs_(film)" title="Internal Affairs (film)">Internal Affairs</a></i> that helped to revive the career of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gere" title="Richard Gere">Richard Gere</a>. His next Hollywood feature <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Jones_(film)" title="Mr. Jones (film)">Mr. Jones</a></i> was misunderstood by the studio who attempted to market the downbeat story as a feelgood movie resulting in a box office flop. Figgis poured his disenchantment with the film industry into <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Las_Vegas" title="Leaving Las Vegas">Leaving Las Vegas</a></i>, creating star turns for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage" title="Nicolas Cage">Nicolas Cage</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Shue" title="Elisabeth Shue">Elisabeth Shue</a> which earned Figgis <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nominations for Best Directing and Best Screenplay. His most ambitious film to date is the low budget film <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Loss_of_Sexual_Innocence" title="The Loss of Sexual Innocence">The Loss of Sexual Innocence</a>, a loosely based autobiographical movie of the director himself.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forays into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video" title="Digital video">digital video</a> technology led him to conceive of and direct <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timecode_(film)" title="Timecode (film)">Timecode</a></i>, which took advantage of the technology to create an ensemble film shot simultaneously with four cameras all in one take and also presented simultaneously and uncut, dividing the screen into four quarters. Since then, his work output has almost exclusively been on the cutting edge of creative digital filmmaking, with the exception of star-laden <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Creek_Manor" title="Cold Creek Manor">Cold Creek Manor</a></i>. He returned to the <i>Timecode</i> quad-screen approach for his section of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Minutes_Older" title="Ten Minutes Older">Ten Minutes Older</a></i>, but has also worked on documentary pieces including a segment of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_(film)" title="The Blues (film)">The Blues</a> (called Red, White, and Blues)</i> and a short piece on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco" title="Flamenco">flamenco</a>. His curiosity with the cinematic use of time has led him to cite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Enrico" title="Robert Enrico">Robert Enrico</a>'s film version of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Occurrence_at_Owl_Creek_Bridge" title="An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge">An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge</a></i> as an influential film for him. Figgis has a well-documented love-hate relationship with the Hollywood system which leads him to often be an outspoken critic of the system while also despairing the lack of a better alternative, in his mind, at the moment. At an appearance at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camerimage" title="Camerimage">Camerimage</a> in 2005, he expressed the view that filmmaking had become "boring and perhaps need[ed] to become even worse before anything better can emerge" successfully at least in reaction.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was the founding patron of the independent filmmakers online community <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_People" title="Shooting People">Shooting People</a>. At one of their events in 2005 he said that filmmaking with a small digital camera made the experience more like painting or novel writing than the movie industry. His fascination with camera technology has also led him to create a camera stabilization rig for smaller video cameras, called the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_Rig" title="Fig Rig">Fig Rig</a> which places the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera" title="Camera">camera</a> on a platform held within a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel" title="Steering wheel">steering wheel</a>-like system and has since been released by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfrotto_Group" title="Manfrotto Group">Manfrotto Group</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since 2008 Mike Figgis is professor of film studies at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Graduate_School" title="European Graduate School">European Graduate School</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saas-Fee" title="Saas-Fee">Saas-Fee</a>, Switzerland, where he conducts intensive summer seminars.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2008, Figgis was called upon by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_for_London" title="Transport for London">Transport for London</a> to help shoot a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_information_film" title="Public information film">PIF</a> entitled <i>A Little Thought From Each of Us, A Big Difference For Everyone</i>, encouraging more considerate behaviour on London's public transport systems, which was then shown in London cinemas. The ad comprised the screen split into four sections, each section showing one of four scenarios all on the same double-decker bus. At the end of the ad, the friction-creating scenarios were resolved and the ad ended on "A little thought from each of us. A big difference for everyone."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To promote a new camera phone, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson" title="Sony Ericsson">Sony Ericsson</a> commissioned Mike Figgis to create <i>Life Captured</i> - a short film made out of mobile phone snapshots taken by fourteen people from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, who were selected to submit a series of photos after winning the global <i>Life captured</i> competition.</p>

Their relationship is doomed; Sera has to promise Ben she will never ask him to stop drinking, and Ben is not allowed to criticize Sera's occupation. At first the two are stable. Ben is "totally at ease with this (Sera's prostitution)." However, each becomes frustrated with the other's behavior. Sera attempts to get Ben to eat but Ben stumbles for more alcohol. Sera begs him to see a doctor. Ben, furious but intoxicated, brings another prostitute (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariska_Hargitay" title="Mariska Hargitay">Mariska Hargitay</a>) to Sera's house. Sera returns home and throws Ben out. Shortly afterward, she is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raped" title="Raped">raped</a> and beaten by three teenagers, and the injuries make her occupation obvious. After being evicted, Sera receives a call from Ben, who is on his deathbed. She visits Ben and they have sex. They fall asleep, and when Ben wakes up, he looks across at Sera, who is lying on top of him, and dies while holding her as she sleeps. His last word is "wow".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mike Figgis based <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i> on a 1990 autobiographical novel by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O%27Brien" title="John O'Brien">John O'Brien</a>, who committed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a> in April 1994, shortly after finding out his novel was being made into a film. Despite basing most of his screenplay on O'Brien's novel, Figgis spoke of a personal attachment with the novel. "Anything I would do would be because I had a sympathetic feeling towards it. That's why I did <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Jones_(film)" title="Mr. Jones (film)">Mr. Jones</a></i>, because I think <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" title="Bipolar disorder">manic-depression</a> is a fascinating, sad, and amazing phenomenon. It's not a coincidence that some of the greatest artists have been manic-depressive[s]. That made it, to me, a fascinating subject that, alas, did not come out in the film."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figgis encouraged the lead actors to experience their character's ordeals first-hand by extensive research. He told <i>Film Critic</i>: "It was just a week and a half of rehearsal. A lot of conversations. A lot of communication in the year before we made the film. Reading the book. I encouraged them [Cage and Shue] to do their own research, which they wanted to do anyway, and then ultimately the three of us got together and just started talking...talking about anything, not necessarily about the film or the script, about anything that came up." Cage researched by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_drinking" title="Binge drinking">binge drinking</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> for two weeks and had a friend videotape him so he could study his speech. He also visited hospitalized career <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics" title="Alcoholics">alcoholics</a>. He said "it was one of the most enjoyable pieces of research I've ever had to do for a part." Shue spent time interviewing several Las Vegas prostitutes.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The meager budget dictated the production and Figgis ended up filming in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_16mm" title="Super 16mm">super 16mm</a> and composing his own score. He remarked, "We didn't have any money, and we weren't pretending to be something we weren't. We couldn't shut down The Strip to shoot." Figgis had problems because permits were not issued for some street scenes. This caused him to film some scenes on the Las Vegas strip in one shot to avoid the police, which Figgis said benefited production and the authenticity of the acting: " 'I've always hated the convention of shooting on a street, and then having to stop the traffic, and then having to tell the actors, 'Well, there's meant to be traffic here, so you're going to have to shout.' And they're shouting, but it's quiet and they feel really stupid, because it's unnatural. You put them up against a couple of trucks, with it all happening around them, and their voices become great."</p>

Ben and Sera build their relationship on the foundation that neither of them can change who they are if they are going to continue pursuing a life together, further validating the theme of a tragic love story born in a desperate world between two self-destructive people (Ben with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>, Sera with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>). Nicolas Cage called Ben "crumbled elegance", and viewed him as a man who once had it all; Cage thus tried to give the character a kind of "continental elegance when he was in a bad situation". Cage continued by saying that the elegance is imploding on him because of the booze, causing it to fall apart. "But you still get the idea of what it used to be." There is hope, however, with Sera's character, who despite having nobody to turn to, is less unfortunate and dependent. Shue perceived her character in a similar light: "She is a wounded soul. She is clinging to hope in the midst of desperation. I think they are not of the world, there is a mythical nature to their love. A couple with a positive energy. A contradiction to other elements."</p>
