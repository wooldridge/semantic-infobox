	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>William Oliver Stone</b> (born September 15, 1946) is an American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">film director</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter" title="Screenwriter">screenwriter</a>.

His work has earned him three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>, and continues to focus frequently on contemporary political and cultural issues, often controversially. His first Academy Award was for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Writing_Adapted_Screenplay" title="Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Express_(film)" title="Midnight Express (film)">Midnight Express</a></i> (1978).

He has been described, by the British newspaper <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> as "one of the few committed men of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_wing" title="Left wing">left</a> working in mainstream American cinema.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A notable feature of Stone's directing style is the use of many different cameras and film formats, from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS" title="VHS">VHS</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film" title="8 mm film">8 mm film</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70_mm_film" title="70 mm film">70 mm film</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, the son of Jacqueline (nÃ©e Goddet) and Louis Stone, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockbroker" title="Stockbroker">stockbroker</a>. He grew up affluently and lived in townhouses in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford,_Connecticut" title="Stamford, Connecticut">Stamford, Connecticut</a>. His father was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew" title="Jew">Jewish</a> and his mother a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">French</a>-born <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> (Stone speaks French with considerable fluency). As a religious compromise, Stone was raised in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America">Episcopalian Church</a>, but has since converted to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.

His mother was often absent and his father made a big impact on his life; father-son relationships were to feature heavily in Stone's films. His parents divorced when he was 15, due to his father's extramarital affairs with the wives of several family friends. Stone's father was also influential in obtaining jobs for his son, including work on a financial exchange in France, where Stone often spent his summer vacation with his maternal grandparents - a job that proved inspirational to Stone for his movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_(1987_film)" title="Wall Street (1987 film)">Wall Street</a></i>. Stone graduated from The Hill School in 1964.</p>

From the moment the movie was released, she blasted it as untruthful and inaccurate. Surviving members of the band, John Densmore and Robby Krieger, also cooperated with the filming of <i>Doors</i>, but distanced themselves from the work before the film's release.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also in 1997, Stone was one of 34 celebrities to sign an open letter to then-German Chancellor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Kohl" title="Helmut Kohl">Helmut Kohl</a>, published as a newspaper advertisement in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Herald_Tribune" title="International Herald Tribune">International Herald Tribune</a></i>, which protested against the treatment of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_in_Germany" title="Scientology in Germany">Scientologists in Germany</a> and compared it to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi" title="Nazi">Nazis</a>' oppression of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew" title="Jew">Jews</a> in the 1930s.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, Stone defended his decision not to interview Hugo Chavez's opponents during the filming of his documentary <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_the_Border_(film)" title="South of the Border (film)">South of the Border</a>. Stone indicated that people hear enough of those complaints already and that the movie is not intended to be a detailed examination of Chavez's record. He praised Chavez as a leader of a movement for "social transformation" in Latin America and expressed his deep admiration for him.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone loosely based <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface_(1983_film)" title="Scarface (1983 film)">Scarface</a></i> on his own addiction to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> which he had to kick while writing the screenplay. On the DVD of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Born_Killers" title="Natural Born Killers">Natural Born Killers</a>: The Director's Cut</i>, one of the producers, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Hamsher" title="Jane Hamsher">Jane Hamsher</a>, recounts stories of taking <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms" title="Psilocybin mushrooms">psilocybin mushrooms</a> with Stone and some of the cast and crew and almost getting pulled over by a police officerâ€”a situation which Stone later wrote into the film. In 1999, Stone was arrested and pleaded guilty to "alcohol and drug charges." He was ordered into a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation" title="Drug rehabilitation">rehabilitation program</a>. He was arrested again on the night of May 27, 2005 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> for possession of an undisclosed illegal drug.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a January 2008 interview with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer" title="The Observer">The Observer</a></i>, Stone expressed disgust for what he claims to be the ongoing U.S.-supported paramilitary violence in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>'s "war on drugs." He accompanied <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez" title="Hugo ChÃ¡vez">Hugo ChÃ¡vez</a>, Venezuela's president and third party negotiator with the Colombian guerrilla group known as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia" title="Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</a>, in the release of three hostages held for over six years, another episode in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_exchange" title="Humanitarian exchange">humanitarian exchange</a> affair.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The visit was part of his research for an upcoming film he will be directing which addresses the crisis. The FARC, designated a terrorist organization by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> and the United States, was described in a 2005 United Nations report as responsible for "grave" human rights violations, including "murders of protected persons, torture and hostage-taking" against "women, returnees, boys and girls, and ethnic groups." During <i>The Observer</i> interview, Stone did not condemn the FARC outright; "I do think that by the standards of Western civilization they go too far; they kidnap innocent people. On the other hand, they're fighting a desperate battle against highly financed, American-supported forces who have been terrorizing the countryside for years and kill most of the people. FARC is fighting back as best it can and grabbing hostages is the fashion in which they can finance themselves and try to achieve their goals, which are difficult. They're a peasant army; I see them as a Zapata-like army. I think they are heroic to fight for what they believe in and die for it, as was Castro in the hills of Cuba."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone made the comments shortly after returning from a trip to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, where he was to have filmed footage of the expected release of three FARC hostages, including a young child named Emanuel. Despite the breakup of the international commission appointed to oversee the release, FARC ultimately released two of the hostages despite their refusal to identify the hostages' exact location. It was subsequently revealed that the FARC could not have released the child because they no longer held him. Instead the child had been placed in foster care and subsequently adopted by the Colombian welfare system (the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ICBF&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="ICBF (page does not exist)">ICBF</a>) because of signs of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse" title="Child abuse">child abuse</a>. The purported hostage release had been a FARC ruse all along. Nevertheless, Stone blamed the Colombian government and the United States for the fiasco.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In January 2010, Stone stated that, "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a> is an easy scapegoat throughout history and itâ€™s been used cheaply [...] Heâ€™s the product of a series of actions. Itâ€™s cause and effect."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an interview with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> newspaper in July 25, 2010, Stone claimed that America does not know "the full story" on Iran and complained about Jewish influence in parts of the US media and foreign policy. When Stone was asked why so much of an emphasis has been placed on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, as opposed to the 25-plus million casualties the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, for example, suffered in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>; he explained that there was a powerful Jewish lobby within the US. The remarks were heavily criticised by Jewish groups, including the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Wiesenthal_Center" title="Simon Wiesenthal Center">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee" title="American Jewish Committee">American Jewish Committee</a>, as well as from Israel's Diaspora Affairs and Public Diplomacy Minister.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone apologized a day later, stating: â€œIn trying to make a broader historical point about the range of atrocities the Germans committed against many people, I made a clumsy association about the Holocaust, for which I am sorry and I regret. [...] The fact that the Holocaust is still a very important, vivid and current matter today is, in fact, a great credit to the very hard work of a broad coalition of people committed to the remembrance of this atrocity - and it was an atrocity.â€&#157;</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On July 28th, 2010, Stone issued a second apology to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League" title="Anti-Defamation League">ADL</a>, which was accepted. "I believe he now understands the issues and where he was wrong, and this puts an end to the matter," said ADL National Director Abraham Foxman.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1993, Stone produced a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries" title="Miniseries">miniseries</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC Television</a> called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Palms" title="Wild Palms">Wild Palms</a></i>. In a cameo, Stone appears on a television in the show discussing how the theories in his film <i>JFK</i> had been proven correct (the series took place in a hypothetical future, 2007). <i>Wild Palms</i> has developed a moderate cult following in the years since it aired, and has recently been released on DVD. That same year, he also spoofed himself in the comedy hit <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_(film)" title="Dave (film)">Dave</a></i>, espousing a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> about the President's replacement by a near-identical double. In 1997, Stone published <i>A Child's Night Dream</i>, a largely autobiographical novel first written in 1966-1967. After several unsuccessful attempts to get the work published, he "threw several sections of the manuscript into the East River one cold night, and, as if surgically removing the memory of the book from my mind, volunteered for Vietnam in 1967." Eventually, he dug out the remaining pages, rewrote the manuscript, and published it.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2003, Stone made two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film" title="Documentary film">documentary films</a>: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_Non_Grata_(film)" title="Persona Non Grata (film)">Persona Non Grata</a></i>, about the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comandante" title="Comandante">Comandante</a></i>, about Cuban President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>.

Stone had been previously refused permission by the Iranian government when the President's media advisor, Mehdi Kalhor, denounced Stone as being part of the "Great Satan" of American culture, despite his opposition to the Bush administration. However, Ahmadinejad approved permission a month later, saying he had "no objections" provided the documentary was based on accurate facts. Stone is due to visit Tehran to negotiate the production of the film with Iranian officials, possibly the president himself.</p>

The documentary features informal interviews by Stone with Chavez and six allied leftist presidents, from Bolivia's Evo Morales to Cuba's Raul Castro. Stone stated that he hopes the film will help people better understand a leader who is wrongly ridiculed "as a strongman, as a buffoon, as a clown." In May 2010, Stone began a Latin American tour to promote the film, with screenings planned in Ecuador, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina. The documentary was also being released in some cities in the United States and Europe in the summer.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film became embroiled in controversy even before it was finished filming, after <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> national security correspondent George Lardner showed up on the set.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film opens with newsreel footage, including the farewell address in 1961 of outgoing President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D.

This is followed by a summary of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s years as president, emphasizing the events that, in Stone's thesis, would lead to his assassination. This builds to a reconstruction of the assassination on November 22, 1963. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney" title="District attorney">District Attorney</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Garrison" title="Jim Garrison">Jim Garrison</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner" title="Kevin Costner">Kevin Costner</a>) subsequently learns about potential links to the assassination in New Orleans.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The investigation is reopened in late 1966 after Garrison reads the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Commission" title="Warren Commission">Warren Report</a> and notices what he believes are numerous inaccuracies and conflicts. Garrison and his staff interrogate several witnesses to the Kennedy assassination, and others who were involved with Oswald, Ruby, and Ferrie. Upon Shaw's informal questioning, Shaw denies any knowledge of meeting Ferrie, O'Keefe or Oswald, but he is soon charged with conspiring to murder the President. Another witness is Willie O'Keefe (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bacon" title="Kevin Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a>), a male prostitute serving five years in prison for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliciting" title="Soliciting">soliciting</a>, who reveals he witnessed Ferrie discussing Kennedy's assassination with Shaw, Oswald, and a group of Latin men. As well as briefly meeting Oswald, O'Keefe was romantically involved with a man he knew as "Clay Bertrand", who was Clay Shaw. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Hill" title="Jean Hill">Jean Hill</a> (Ellen McElduff), a teacher who describes that she witnessed shots fired from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassy_knoll" title="Grassy knoll">grassy knoll</a> and she heard four to six shots total, tells the investigators that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service" title="United States Secret Service">Secret Service</a> threatened her into saying only three shots came from the book depository, revealing changes that were made to her testimony by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Commission" title="Warren Commission">Warren Commission</a>. Garrison and a staff member also go to the sniper's location in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_School_Book_Depository" title="Texas School Book Depository">Texas School Book Depository</a> and aim an empty rifle from the window through which Oswald was alleged to have shot Kennedy. They conclude that Oswald was too poor a marksman to make the shots, and two of the shots were much too close together, indicating that two additional assassins were also involved.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After discovering electronic surveillance microphones that had been planted in his offices, Garrison meets a high-level figure in Washington D.C. who identifies himself as "X" (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland" title="Donald Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>). "X" suggests there was a conspiracy at the highest levels of government, implicating members of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a>, the military-industrial complex, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia" title="Mafia">Mafia</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service" title="United States Secret Service">Secret Service</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a>, and Kennedy's vice-president, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_Baines_Johnson" title="Lyndon Baines Johnson">Lyndon Baines Johnson</a>, as either assassination pre-planning co-conspirators, or, as having motives to cover up the truth after the assassination. "X" explains the President was killed because of a more peaceful outlook in Kennedy's foreign policy which meant diminished profit for the military-industrial complex. It also enraged high-ranking military officials who viewed such diplomacy as weakness. Kennedy ordered control of secret para-military operations to be removed from the CIA and handed over to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="United States Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff" title="Joint Chiefs of Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>. This would have diminished the agency's power.

Kennedy, Sr">Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr</a>, who had done business with the Mafia dating back to the 1920s, and felt betrayed that he had let his brother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Kennedy" title="Bobby Kennedy">Bobby Kennedy</a>, continue his anti-Mob crusade instead of stopping it as he had promised. Furthermore, the Mob wanted revenge for the Bay of Pigs fiasco, which they had helped fund and support in order to get their Cuban casinosâ€”their biggest moneymakersâ€”back from the hands of the Castro government.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is clear who "Y" is in the film based on a partial glimpse of the name plate on his desk: General <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lansdale" title="Edward Lansdale">Edward Lansdale</a>, a real life figure who specialized in counter-insurgency.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of Garrison's staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods, so they leave the investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sissy_Spacek" title="Sissy Spacek">Sissy Spacek</a>) complains that he is spending more time on the case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ferrie, die in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy around Kennedy's death that involved co-conspirators that were involved in the CIA operation named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Project" title="Cuban Project">Operation Mongoose</a>.</p>

The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw died of lung cancer in 1974, but in 1979 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Helms" title="Richard Helms">Richard Helms</a> testified under oath that Clay Shaw had, in fact, been a part-time contract agent of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zachary Sklar, a journalist and a professor of journalism at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_School_of_Journalism" title="Columbia School of Journalism">Columbia School of Journalism</a>, met Jim Garrison in 1987 and helped him rewrite a manuscript that he was working on about the Kennedy assassination. He changed it from a scholarly book in the third person to "a detective storyâ€”a whydunit" in the first person. Sklar edited the book and it was published in 1988. While attending the Latin American Film Festival in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana" title="Havana">Havana</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, Stone met Sheridan Square Press publisher Ellen Ray on an elevator. She had published Jim Garrison's book <i>On the Trail of the Assassins</i>. Ray had gone to New Orleans and worked with Garrison in 1967. She gave Stone a copy of Garrison's book and told him to read it. He did and quickly bought the film rights with $250,000 of his own money to prevent talk going around the studios about projects he might be developing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Kennedy Assassination had always had a profound effect on Stone: "The Kennedy murder was one of the signal events of the postwar generation, my generation". The filmmaker met Garrison and grilled him with a variety of questions for three hours. The man stood up to Stone's questioning and then got up and left. His <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris" title="Hubris">hubris</a> impressed the director. Stone's impressions from their meeting were that Garrison "made many mistakes. He trusted a lot of weirdos and followed a lot of fake leads. But he went out on a limb, way out. And he kept going, even when he knew he was facing long odds".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone was not interested in making a film about Garrison's life but rather the story behind the conspiracy to kill Kennedy. He also bought the film rights to <i>Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy</i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Marrs" title="Jim Marrs">Jim Marrs</a>. One of the filmmaker's primary goals with <i>JFK</i> was to provide a rebuttal to the Warren Commission Report that he believed was "a great myth. And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a counter-myth". Even though Marrsâ€™ book collected many theories, Stone was hungry for more and hired Jane Rusconi, a recent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> graduate, to head up a team of researchers and assemble as much information about the assassination as possible while the director completed post-production on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_on_the_Fourth_of_July_(film)" title="Born on the Fourth of July (film)">Born on the Fourth of July</a></i>. Stone read two dozen books on the JFK assassination while Rusconi read between 100 to 200 books on the subject.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By December 1989, Stone began approaching studios to back his film. While in pre-production on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_(film)" title="The Doors (film)">The Doors</a></i>, he met with three executives at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> who wanted him to make a film about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>. However, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> owned the rights and so Stone pitched <i>JFK</i>.

He had a reputation for making political and controversial films with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_President%27s_Men_(film)" title="All the President's Men (film)">All the President's Men</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Parallax_View" title="The Parallax View">The Parallax View</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_Fields_(film)" title="The Killing Fields (film)">The Killing Fields</a></i>. Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up 20 million dollars for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Stone set out to write the screenplay, he asked Sklar (who also edited Marrsâ€™ book) to co-write it with him and distill the Garrison book, the Marrs book and Rusconi's research into a script that would resemble what he called "a great detective movie". Stone told Sklar his vision of the film: "I see the models as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(film)" title="Z (film)">Z</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_(film)" title="Rashomon (film)">Rashomon</a></i>, I see the event in Dealey Plaza taking place in the first reel, and again in the eighth reel, and again later, and each time we're going to see it differently and with more illumination". Although he did employ ideas from <i>Rashomon</i>, his principal model for <i>JFK</i> was <i>Z</i>: "Somehow I had the impression that in <i>Z</i> you had the showing of the crime and then the re-showing of the crime throughout the picture until it was seen another way. That was the idea of <i>JFK</i> â€“ that was the essence of it: basically, that's why I called it <i>JFK</i>. Not J dot F dot K dot. JFK. It was a code, like <i>Z</i> was a code, for he lives, American-style. As it was written it became more fascinating: it evolved into four DNA threads". Stone broke the structure of his film down into four stories: Garrison investigating the New Orleans connection to the Kennedy assassination; the research that revealed what Stone calls, "Oswald legend: who he was and how to try to inculcate that"; the recreation of the assassination at Dealey Plaza; and the information that the character of X imparts on Garrison, which Stone saw as the "means by which we were able to move between New Orleans, local, into the wider story of Dealey Plaza".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sklar worked on the Garrison side of the story while Stone added the Oswald story, the events at Dealey Plaza and the "Mr. X" character. Sklar spent a year researching and writing a 550 triple-spaced page screenplay and then Stone rewrote it and condensed it closer to normal screenplay length. Stone and Sklar used composite characters, most notably the "Mr. X" character played by Donald Sutherland. This was a technique that would be criticized in the press. He was a mix of Richard Case Nagell and retired <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">Air Force</a> colonel <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Fletcher_Prouty" title="L. Fletcher Prouty">Fletcher Prouty</a>, another adviser for the film and who was a military liaison between the CIA and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon" title="The Pentagon">Pentagon</a>. Meeting Prouty was, for Stone, "one of the most extraordinary afternoons I've ever spent. Pretty much like in the movie, he just started to talk". According to Stone, "I feel this was in the spirit of the truth because Garrison also met a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Throat" title="Deep Throat">deep throat</a> type named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Case_Nagell" title="Richard Case Nagell">Richard Case Nagell</a>, who claimed to be a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a> agent and made Jim aware of a much larger scenario than the microcosm of New Orleans".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Early drafts of the screenplay suggested a four and a half-hour film with a potential budget of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">$</a>40 millionâ€”double what Stone had agreed to with Warner Bros. The director knew film mogul Arnon Milchan and met with him to help finance the film. Milchan was eager to work on the project and launch his new company, Regency Films, with a high profile film like <i>JFK</i>. Milchan made a deal with Warner Bros. to put up the money for the film. Stone managed to pare down his initial revision, a 190-page draft, to a 156-page shooting script.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were many advisers for the film, including Gerald Hemming, a former Marine who claimed involvement in various CIA activities, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Groden" title="Robert Groden">Robert Groden</a>, a photographic expert and longtime JFK assassination researcher and author.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The story revolves around Costner's Jim Garrison, with a large cast of well-known stars in the supporting roles. Stone was inspired by the casting model of the documentary epic <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Longest_Day_(film)" title="The Longest Day (film)">The Longest Day</a></i> which he had admired as a child: "It was realistic, but it had a lot of stars...the supporting cast provides a map of the American psyche: familiar, comfortable faces that walk you through a winding path in the dark woods".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Richardson_(cinematographer)" title="Robert Richardson (cinematographer)">Robert Richardson</a> was a week and a half into shooting <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Hope_(film)" title="City of Hope (film)">City of Hope</a></i> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sayles" title="John Sayles">John Sayles</a> when he got word that Stone was thinking about making <i>JFK</i>. By the time principal photography wrapped on <i>City of Hope</i>, Richardson was ready to make Stone's film. To prepare, Richardson read up on various JFK assassination books starting with <i>On the Trail of the Assassins</i> and <i>Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The original idea was to film the opening sequence in 1.33:1 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)" title="Aspect ratio (image)">aspect ratio</a> in order to simulate the TV screens that were available at the time of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone wanted to recreate the Kennedy Assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council a substantial amount of money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35Â mm and five 16Â mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_School_Book_Depository" title="Texas School Book Depository">Texas School Book Depository</a> was more difficult. They had to pay fifty thousand dollars to put someone in the window that Lee Harvey Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy from. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor, and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The production spent four million to restore Dealey Plaza to 1963 conditions. Stone utilized a variety of film stocks. Richardson said, "It depends whether you want to shoot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film" title="35 mm film">35</a> or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_mm_film" title="16 mm film">16</a> or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_8_mm_film" title="Super 8 mm film">Super 8</a>. In many cases the lighting has to be different". For certain shots in the film, Stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once, using five cameras at the same time in different formats. Richardson said of Stone's style of direction, "Oliver disdains convention, he tries to force you into things that are not classic. There's this constant need to stretch". This forced the cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and relying very little on classic lighting modes. The shoot lasted 79 days with filming finished five months before the release date.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>JFK</i> marked a fundamental change in the way that Stone constructed his films: a subjective lateral presentation of the plot, with the rhythm of the editing carrying the story. Stone brought in Hank Corwin, an editor of commercials, to help edit the film. Stone chose him because his "chaotic mind" was "totally alien to the film form". Stone remembers that Corwin irritated the more traditional editors working on the film because his "concepts are very commercial sixty-seconds-get-your-attention-fragment-your-mind-make-you-rethink-it. But he had not developed the long form yet. And so a lot of his cuts were very chaotic". Stone employed extensive use of flashbacks within flashbacks for a specific effect. He said in an interview, "I wanted to do the film on two or three levelsâ€”sound and picture would take us back, and we'd go from one flashback to another, and then that flashback would go inside another flashback...I wanted multiple layers because reading the Warren Commission Report is like drowning". This film was Stone's last one to use editing on film before he switched to digital editing. A setback occurred during editing that saw all the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_code" title="Time code">time codes</a> disappear.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of his enormous commitment to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)" title="Hook (film)"><i>Hook</i></a>, which opened the same month as <i>JFK</i>, composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a> did not have time to compose a conventional score for the entire film. Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for <i>JFK</i> before he saw the entire film. Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour's worth of edited footage and some dailies. Williams remembers, "I thought his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald was particularly strong, and I understood some of the atmosphere of the film â€“ the sordid elements, the underside of New Orleans". Stone and his team then actually cut the film to fit Williams' music after the composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to the initial six he had done prior to seeing the film. For the Motorcade sequence, Williams described the score he composed as "strongly kinetic music, music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines". The composer remembered the moment he learned of the assassination of Kennedy and it stuck with him for years. This was a significant factor in his deciding to work on the film. Williams said, "This is a very resonant subject for people of my generation, and that's why I welcomed the opportunity to participate in this film".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On popular review aggregator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film holds a 82% rating, based on 52 reviews. However, the film's production and release was subject to intense scrutiny and criticism. A few weeks after shooting had begun, on May 14, 1991, Jon Margolis wrote in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a></i> that <i>JFK</i> was "an insult to the intelligence". Five days later, the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> ran a scathing article by national security correspondent George Lardner titled, "On the Set: Dallas in Wonderland" that used the first draft of the <i>JFK</i> screenplay to blast it for "the absurdities and palpable untruths in Garrison's book and Stone's rendition of it". The article pointed out that Garrison lost his case against Clay Shaw and that he inflated his case by trying to use Shaw's homosexual relationships to prove guilt by association. Stone responded to Lardner's article by hiring a public relations firm that specialized in political issues. Other critical articles soon followed. Anthony Lewis in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> stated that the film "tells us that our government cannot be trusted to give an honest account of a Presidential assassination". <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> columnist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Will" title="George Will">George Will</a> called Stone "a man of technical skill, scant education and negligible conscience".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine ran their own critique of the film-in-progress on June 10, 1991 and alleged that Stone was trying to suppress a rival JFK assassination film based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_DeLillo" title="Don DeLillo">Don DeLillo</a>'s 1988 novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(novel)" title="Libra (novel)">Libra</a></i>. Stone rebutted these claims in a letter to the magazine. The filmmaker ended up splitting his time between making his film, responding to criticism, and conducting a publicity campaign of his own that saw him "omnipresent, from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Evening_News" title="CBS Evening News">CBS Evening News</a></i>, to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show" title="The Oprah Winfrey Show">Oprah</a></i>". However, the Lardner <i>Post</i> piece stung the most because Lardner had stolen a copy of the script. Stone recalls, "He had the first draft, and I went through probably six or seven drafts".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once the film was released in theaters, it polarized critics. The <i>New York Times</i> ran an article by Bernard Weinraub entitled, "Hollywood Wonders If Warner Brothers let <i>JFK</i> Go Too Far". The article called for intervention by the studio, asking "At what point does a studio exercise its leverage and blunt the highly charged message of a film maker like Oliver Stone?" The newspaper also ran a review of the film by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Canby" title="Vincent Canby">Vincent Canby</a> who wrote, "Mr. Stone's hyperbolic style of film making is familiar: lots of short, often hysterical scenes tumbling one after another, backed by a soundtrack that is layered, strudel-like, with noises, dialogue, music, more noises, more dialogue". Veteran film critic for <i>The Washingtonian</i>, Pat Dowell had her 34-word capsule review for the January issue rejected by her editor John Limpert on the grounds that he did not want a positive review for a film he felt was "preposterous" associated with the magazine. Dowell resigned in protest.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald" title="Miami Herald">Miami Herald</a></i> said about the controversy in its review, "the focus on the trivialities of personality conveniently prevents us from having to confront the tough questions [Stone's] film raises". However, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> praised the film in his review for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i>, saying, "The achievement of the film is not that it answers the mystery of the Kennedy assassination, because it does not, or even that it vindicates Garrison, who is seen here as a man often whistling in the dark. Its achievement is that it tries to marshal the anger which ever since 1963 has been gnawing away on some dark shelf of the national psyche". Rita Kempley in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> wrote, "Quoting everyone from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> to bolster their arguments, Stone and Sklar present a gripping alternative to the Warren Commission's conclusion.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On Christmas Day, the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> ran a critical article entitled, "Suppression of the Facts Grants Stone a Broad Brush". <i>New York Newsday</i> followed suit the next day with two articles â€” "The Blurred Vision of <i>JFK</i>" and "The Many Theories of a Jolly Green Giant". A few days later, the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i> followed suit with "Stone's Film Trashes Facts, Dishonors J.F.K." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Valenti" title="Jack Valenti">Jack Valenti</a>, then president and chief executive of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America" title="Motion Picture Association of America">Motion Picture Association of America</a>, denounced Stone's film in a seven-page statement. He wrote, "In much the same way, young German boys and girls in 1941 were mesmerized by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Reifenstahl" title="Leni Reifenstahl">Leni Reifenstahl</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Will" title="Triumph of the Will">Triumph of the Will</a></i>, in which <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was depicted as a newborn God. Both <i>J. F. K.</i> and <i>Triumph of the Will</i> are equally a propaganda masterpiece and equally a hoax. Mr. Stone and Leni Reifenstahl have another genetic linkage: neither of them carried a disclaimer on their film that its contents were mostly pure fiction".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone recalls in an interview, "I can't even remember all the threats, there were so many of them". <i>Time</i> magazine ranked it the fourth best film of 1991. Roger Ebert went on to name Stone's film as the best film of the year and one of the top ten films of the decade. The <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" title="Sydney Morning Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a></i> named <i>JFK</i> as the best film of 1991. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> ranked it the 5th Most Controversial Movie Ever.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Years after its release, Stone said of the film that it "was the beginning of a new era for me in terms of film making because it's not just about a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. It's also about the way we look at our recent history...It shifts from black and white to color, and then back again, and views people from offbeat angles".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his book <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaiming_History" title="Reclaiming History">Reclaiming History</a></i>, a history of the Kennedy assassination published 16 years after the release of <i>JFK</i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Bugliosi" title="Vincent Bugliosi">Vincent Bugliosi</a> devoted an entire chapter to Jim Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw and Oliver Stone's subsequent film. Bugliosi lists thirty-two separate "lies and fabrications" in Stone's movie and describes the film as "one continuous lie in which Stone couldn't find any level of deception and invention beyond which he was unwilling to go."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>JFK</i> was released in theaters on December 20, 1991. The box office for the film started slow but picked up momentum and by the first week in January 1992, it had grossed over <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USD" title="USD">$</a>50 million worldwide. Stone started to get support for his film. Warner Brothers executives pointed out that because of the film's long running time, it had fewer screenings. The studio undertook a $15 million marketing campaign promoting Stone's film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On its first week of release, <i>JFK</i> tied with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(1991_film)" title="Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)">Beauty and the Beast</a></i> for fifth place in the U.S. box office and its critics began to say it was a flop. However, <i>JFK</i> eventually earned over $205 million worldwide, and $70 million in the United States during its initial run. Garrison's estate subsequently sued <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> for a share of the film's profits, alleging a book-keeping practice known as "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting" title="Hollywood accounting">Hollywood accounting</a>".
