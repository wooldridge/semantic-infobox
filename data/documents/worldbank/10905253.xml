(EDI), as reflected in some text)&#13;
&#13;
The Economic Development Institute (EDI) of the World Bank sponsored a core course on&#13;
health sector reform and sustainable financing, held in Washington, D.C., in&#13;
October/November 1997. The month-long course consisted of eight separate week-long&#13;
modules. The course's 78 participants included mid-career and senior program managers&#13;
involved in their countries' health sector reform efforts and World Bank staff. Many different&#13;
teaching and learning methods were used throughout the course, including distance learning,&#13;
the case-method of learning, applied software and the use of internationally known experts.&#13;
&#13;
Both formative and summative evaluations were conducted for the eight modules and the&#13;
overall course. Various methods were used in these evaluations. Formative evaluations&#13;
consisted of using continuing and open-ended feedback procedures to provide information to&#13;
the course planners that allowed them to make adjustments in individual modules and for the&#13;
overall course. The summative evaluation methods included specialized and standardized&#13;
End-of-Module (EOM) and End-of-Course (EOC) questionnaires. It also used a pre/post&#13;
design to administer a set of cognitively based questions to estimate the effects of the&#13;
distance learning method used in Module 1. Following are some of the major evaluation&#13;
findings:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Results from the evaluation show an overall high approval rating by participants with a&#13;
        number of areas and items emerging as specific strengths and weaknesses. Results&#13;
        also showed a great deal of openness and flexibility on the part of the course&#13;
        organizers to utilize feedback and make mid-course corrections. A vast majority of&#13;
        participants viewed many aspects of the course favorably. These included support&#13;
        activities, course content and preparation, and the amount they learned from their&#13;
        participation in the month-long program. There was significant variation among&#13;
        modules on the degree of positive reaction by participants, and significant variation&#13;
        among various items.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  In-course feedback opportunities were built into the program and appear to have been&#13;
        used effectively by staff to make mid-course corrections. A strong example of this&#13;
        interest in course quality and willingness to make changes can be seen in Module 6.&#13;
        Two sessions of this module were offered in successive weeks. Results from the first&#13;
        week's experience were used to make changes in the second week's program. The&#13;
        results showed an overall increase in effectiveness across groups and items.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Pre/post self assessments of how much participants learned in each module showed&#13;
        very large increases. However, Module 1 utilized a limited set of cognitive-based&#13;
        questions to measure the degree of "learning" in a more objective manner. Results&#13;
        from this limited test show that much less may have been learned than suggested by&#13;
        the pre/post self assessments.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
lThere were some important differences between subgroups. Results from the study&#13;
 were broken down by two major subgroups: 1.) Participants with and without&#13;
 certificates/degrees in economics; and, 2.) Participants with 10 years or less and&#13;
 more than 10 years work experience in the healthcare field. The greatest differences&#13;
 appeared between those with and without training in economics. The differences&#13;
 between those with and without training in economics appear to be related to the&#13;
 subject content and technical difficulty of the modules' materials .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe most common complaint by participants related to the amount of daily&#13;
 preparation required, especially the amount of required reading during the evening, and&#13;
 the feeling that the time allowed for preparation was inadequate. Participants also felt&#13;
 that many of the examples used during modules did not relate adequately to their&#13;
 national situations. Despite these perceived shortcomings, participants felt that the&#13;
 course provided solid technical training in healthcare reform, presented by competent&#13;
 experts, and the experience was highly effective in meeting their needs and&#13;
 requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThere were several limiting factors in the evaluation. This was the result of attempting&#13;
 to apply a complex evaluation in an applied setting. These limitations, while&#13;
 unavoidable, should be considered when interpreting the results of the evaluation.&#13;
 Limitations included measurement of initial and immediate effects of the training; the&#13;
 inability to link results from different modules because of the lack of personal&#13;
 identifier; the use of impressionistic measures of knowledge achievement; a possibly&#13;
 invalid measurement scale; and the presence of confounding factors in the application&#13;
 of the touch pad session used to administer cognitively based questions for&#13;
 measuring learning.&#13;
