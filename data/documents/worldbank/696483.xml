1. URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS&#13;
1.1   The mid-1970s loss to pollution of a major urban raw water supply near Beijing&#13;
first drew China's attention to the damage pollution could cause. Over the ensuing 20&#13;
years China has developed an environmental protection system employing a broad set of&#13;
control instruments administered through environmental protection bureaus now found in&#13;
all cities and virtually all rural counties. A national environmental action plan has been&#13;
developed to coordinate domestic environmental improvement efforts. China has also&#13;
been a responsive partner in international efforts to control pollution and was one of the&#13;
first countries to finish their Agenda 21 program after the Rio conference.&#13;
1.2   Despite this activism, China has had mixed success in implementing&#13;
environmental policy over the past two decades. Some aspects of the record are quite&#13;
good-airborne total suspended particulate (TSP) concentrations have been markedly&#13;
reduced in cities in both north and south China and state-owned enterprise discharges of&#13;
toxic metals in wastewater have fallen substantially. In line with rapidly increasing&#13;
urbanization and economic growth, the demands made on water resources are exceeding&#13;
supply. Water pollution continues to grow. The percentage of urban aquifers found to be&#13;
polluted has risen from 20 percent in 1983 to 45 percent today. In the most recently&#13;
published water quality survey, sections of rivers in 54 of 58 reporting cities failed to&#13;
meet even the lowest acceptable standard, leaving few economic uses-except as waste&#13;
sinks.&#13;
1.3   The human cost of this pollution is high. Over 400 million Chinese live in cities,&#13;
a number expected to jump to some 800 million by 2010. The health costs of water&#13;
pollution are more difficult to measure. Raw water pollution has forced cities to move to&#13;
increasingly distant and more expensive raw water sources; farmers have had to switch&#13;
from irrigation with surface water to pumping groundwater, and fisheries have been&#13;
damaged.&#13;
1.4   The reasons for the growing pollution are not difficult to identify. A coal-based&#13;
fuel system firing a large stock of inefficient boilers and power plants contributes to air&#13;
quality problems, as does widespread dependence on coal stoves for household cooking&#13;
and heating. With urban growth and rising personal incomes have come rapid increases&#13;
in the volume of municipal wastewater flows-they grew from 7 billion m annually in&#13;
1984 to 13 billion m3 in 1992. Those came with the growth of inhouse water connections&#13;
and of washing machines and flush toilets. Industrial wastewater discharges in urban&#13;
areas declined over that same period, as reuse and other water-saving techniques&#13;
increased water use efficiency. Solid waste generation has grown rapidly, and only some&#13;
25 percent of the municipal solid waste and nightsoil are disposed of to national&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
standards. The remainder is dumped at uncovered dumping sites without leachate or gas&#13;
control facilities.&#13;
1.5   The nature of the discharges affecting the urban environment dictate a mix of&#13;
regulatory and investment responses by different levels of government. These have been&#13;
discussed in two Bank studies, the first analyzing overall environmental circumstances&#13;
and policy (China. Environmental Strategy Paper, Report No. 9669-CHA, April 1992)&#13;
and the second that specific to the urban sector (China: Urban Environmental Service&#13;
Management, Report No, 13073-CHA, December 1994). As described in those reports,&#13;
municipal governments must seek an efficient mix of point source control through&#13;
regulation and collective treatment of wastes.&#13;
B. REGULATION OF POINT SOURCE POLLUTION&#13;
1.6   The regulation of point source pollution falls to the National Environmental&#13;
Protection Agency (NEPA), as the secretariat of the State Council Environmental&#13;
Protection Committee.  NEPA  drafts national regulations and other aspects of&#13;
environmental policy for consideration by the State Council and National People's&#13;
Congress. NEPA has the power to interpret national environmental regulations and&#13;
standards, including those governing the operations of the local environmental protection&#13;
bureaus (EPBs) that work at provincial and municipal level. However, NEPA lacks&#13;
implementation authority, a power left to local governments and the EPBs under them.&#13;
1.7   Provincial governments are authorized to set local environmental standards in the&#13;
absence of preemptive national standards, or to impose more stringent standards than&#13;
those required by the national government. Provincial EPBs coordinate these policies&#13;
and, in contrast to NEPA, may play a direct role in implementation. However, the&#13;
municipal, urban district and county EPBs bear the main burden of enforcement for both&#13;
national and provincial regulations. The budgets, personnel appointments, and work&#13;
plans of each level EPB derive from the government of that level. To aid quality control,&#13;
performance must be reported to the next higher administrative level EPB, which also&#13;
sets testing protocols and other performance criteria.&#13;
1.8   China's regulatory approach has focused on three instruments: environmental&#13;
assessment before approval of new projects; the "three simultaneous" licensing strategy&#13;
that requires integration of pollution control in project design, inclusion of the abatement&#13;
measures in the actual investment, and proper operation of the abatement equipment; and&#13;
a pollution levy fee chargeable against waste streams that have concentrations of&#13;
pollutants above permitted levels. More recently, governments have been authorized to&#13;
levy a small charge on wastewater discharges within standards.&#13;
1.9   The pollution levy fees fund operation of the environmental protection system.&#13;
Local EPBs retain approximately 20 percent of the fees to cover operating costs, while&#13;
earmarking the remaining funds to finance pollution abatement in eligible enterprises.&#13;
The handling of the earmarked funds has shifted over time from being granted directly&#13;
back to the enterprise paying the fee to lending the funds on concessional terms for&#13;
eligible pollution control investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.10 NEPA now recognizes two problems with the pollution levy fee system. First,&#13;
fees are typically set considerably below the marginal cost of effluent treatment, which&#13;
encourages enterprises to pay the fee rather than operate or invest in treatment facilities or&#13;
cleaner production technologies. Second, by setting fees on the basis of concentration-&#13;
based standards may lead to dilution as a means of compliance or reducing fee rates, and&#13;
surface waters receiving discharges could fail to meet standards even though all&#13;
enterprises in a watershed individually meet standards. Conversely, if assimilative&#13;
capacity is high and enterprises few, the concentration standard could force compliance&#13;
costs far above the damage done by the discharge.&#13;
1.11  Two more regulatory issues originate in structural features of the economy. The&#13;
first arises from the fact that local governments usually own the major enterprises within&#13;
their boundaries, leading to pressures to relax regulation or fee collection in the interest of&#13;
employment and profits. The second is that the enterprises operating on the periphery of&#13;
cities may have a large impact on municipal environmental quality, yet fall outside&#13;
municipal control. This latter problem is particularly acute with the small-scale township&#13;
and village enterprises (TVEs). Individual TVE enforcement costs are high relative to&#13;
output, yet in the aggregate TVE pollution has a large impact on the downstream&#13;
environment.&#13;
1.12  NEPA has a large research and experimentation program under way to identify&#13;
new approaches to overcome these and other regulatory problems.  Among these&#13;
initiatives is the use of catchment-specific mass-based pollution permits to replace the&#13;
concentration-based standards and fees. More generally, NEPA seeks effective market-&#13;
based pollution control mechanisms to complement the national shift to a market-based&#13;
economy and avoid many of the problems of enterprise-specific regulation. The Bank&#13;
supports NEPA's program through the Environmental Technical Assistance Project&#13;
(Credit 2522-CHA) and investment projects such as the one now proposed.&#13;
C. COLLECTIVE WASTE HANDLING AND TREATMENT&#13;
1.13  Urban environmental services, which include wastewater collection and treatment&#13;
systems and solid waste collection and treatment, fall under the purview of the&#13;
Construction Commissions found in every Chinese city. Overall regulatory guidance and&#13;
standard setting is provided by the Ministry of Construction and the provincial&#13;
Construction Bureaus. The Ministry and Bureaus set national and provincial policy for&#13;
urban and regional planning, infrastructure development planning, and facility operating&#13;
standards. They also specify financial accounting procedures and goals. Based on those&#13;
policies and standards, the municipal commissions provide or regulate providers of the&#13;
actual service. The municipal commissions are typically among the largest and most&#13;
powerful of the municipal administrative bodies, having under them bureaus or&#13;
companies directly providing key urban services.&#13;
1.14  Chinese cities are characterized by a good correspondence between expenditure&#13;
responsibility and control over revenue. This sets them apart from cities in many&#13;
developing countries, which have been characterized by inadequate funding to meet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
mandated services. Chinese cities also tend to have well-staffed administrations, with&#13;
their broad control over the local economy making them an attractive employer. These&#13;
advantages have helped China achieve piped water supply to nearly 90 percent of all&#13;
urban residents, but has not automatically led to high levels of service in every field. The&#13;
low level of adequate solid waste disposal was cited earlier and local watercourses&#13;
continue to serve as both drains and sewers for nearly 40 percent of the area of Chinese&#13;
cities. Wastewater treatment levels are low, with only 4.5 percent of municipal flows&#13;
treated in 1992.  Cities have given priority to water supply, roads, and enterprise&#13;
investment over environmental services. Yet rapidly growing problems with raw water&#13;
quality are forcing recognition across cities that wastes need to be adequately handled.&#13;
1.15  The major policy problem identified in China: Urban Environmental Service&#13;
Management was the failure to charge, or charge adequately, for environmental services.&#13;
Although cities have long charged for water delivery, residential wastewater charges are&#13;
virtually unknown, while charges to enterprises have been rare, and where collected, fall&#13;
far below operating needs. Solid waste collection fees are charged more often, but those&#13;
services still require substantial subsidies. An important consequence of this failure to&#13;
charge adequate user fees is that service investment programs have failed to meet goals&#13;
due to lack of finance. The Ministry of Construction estimates that two thirds of the&#13;
municipal wastewater treatment plants either do not operate, or operate far below capacity&#13;
due to lack of funds. Moreover, when users do not have to pay they have no incentive to&#13;
reduce waste volumes. This creates the need for larger service systems when they are&#13;
provided.&#13;
D. BANK GROUP SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
1.16  The Bank Group highlighted enhancing environmental protection and alleviating&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks as two of the four areas of concentration under the China&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board in June 1995. Our close&#13;
collaboration with the Chinese govermnent covers both the regulatory and service&#13;
provision aspects of urban environmental management. The China: Environmental&#13;
Strategy Paper sector study led to the Environmental Technical Assistance Project noted&#13;
earlier, which assists NEPA in its efforts to find more efficient regulatory methods,&#13;
improve staff capabilities, and bolster environmental monitoring.  That project&#13;
complements Bank-administered, Japanese Government-financed technical assistance to&#13;
NEPA covering (a) the environmental impact assessment process; (b) waste minimization&#13;
and pollution control in rural industries; (c) hazardous/toxic waste management;&#13;
(d) economic/financial mechanisms for environmental management; and (e) environ-&#13;
mental information management systems.  The Global Environmental Facility has&#13;
supported studies and projects on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the loss of&#13;
biodiversity in China, and ozone-depleting substances. Finally, Beijing Municipality has&#13;
joined with four other Asian cities as members of the Metropolitan Environmental&#13;
Improvement Program financed by the United Nations Development Programme and the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.17  In addition to national regulatory assistance, we are currently involved in six&#13;
urban environmental projects in 12 cities, which incorporate policy, financing and&#13;
organizational strategies for improved environmental regulation and service delivery at&#13;
the provincial and municipal levels. Another five ongoing investment projects in another&#13;
12 cities include related issues such as municipal water supply and sanitation. The initial&#13;
round of projects focused on China's largest cities-Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin-and&#13;
those located primarily in the wealthier northeast and coastal provinces. Environmental&#13;
pressures remain high in those areas and cooperation will continue, as with the recently&#13;
approved Second Shanghai Sewerage Project (Ln. 3987-CHA) and the Shandong&#13;
Environment Project now being prepared. However, the recently approved Hubei Urban&#13;
Environmental Project (Loan 3966/Credit 2799-CHA) marks a shift in geographic focus,&#13;
moving toward inland and poorer areas. Hubei, a medium-income province, is located in&#13;
central China, while operations in poor areas, like the proposed project in Yunnan and&#13;
another being prepared in Guangxi Province, will further test the feasibility of policy and&#13;
institutional solutions.&#13;
1.18  A review of ongoing Bank Group projects in the sector in China and elsewhere&#13;
presents relevant lessons in the provision and management of urban environmental&#13;
services and in industrial pollution control.&#13;
1.19 Bankwide municipal management sector work (Urban Sector Delivery: Finding&#13;
the Right Incentives) emphasizes the need to assign functional responsibilities&#13;
appropriately and link revenue to expenditures. In China's case, environmental services&#13;
are fittingly provided at the municipal level, where a high percentage of government&#13;
revenue is also captured. China: Urban Environmental Service Management concludes&#13;
that the major failing in environmental services has been dependence on municipal&#13;
budget transfers to fund services, while greater reliance on user charges would be&#13;
affordable, induce resource conservation, and create a more dependable income stream.&#13;
Similarly, the Operation and Evaluation Department's review of Bank-financed water and&#13;
sanitation projects (Water Supply and Sanitation Projects: The Bank Experience 1967-&#13;
1989) found generally good physical performance but less successful financial viability&#13;
and overall sectoral development. For that reason, increasing tariffs was a focus of the&#13;
policy dialogue during preparation of this project, with the result that water supply tariffs&#13;
were adjusted prior to project preappraisal and appraisal. This openness to introducing&#13;
improvements was seen during preparation of the Urban Environmental Service study, for&#13;
which Kunming and other Yunnan cities were used as case studies. Urban managers&#13;
from Kunming acted on some of the ideas exchanged during the study even before study&#13;
completion.&#13;
1.20 The Bank's experience of industrial pollution control includes projects in China,&#13;
as well as in Mexico, Brazil, India, Indonesia and the Russian Federation. A review of&#13;
completed projects (Industry and Environment: Pattern in World Bank Lending)&#13;
emphasizes the need for political commitment, clear standards and regulations, incentives&#13;
to comply, and institutional capability to monitor and enforce standards. When industrial&#13;
pollution abatement subloans are involved, the following conditions increase likelihood&#13;
of success: a profitable and growing industrial sector, flexibility in choice of technology,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
availability of funds at close-to-market terms, and targeting on sources that can yield&#13;
significant improvement in the arnbient environment.&#13;
1.21  The industrial pollution control component of the proposed project draws on these&#13;
lessons and those in the two recent environmental sector studies. The latter stress issues&#13;
of political commitment, appropriate standards and incentives, and institutional&#13;
monitoring and enforcement capabilities.  This project addresses those issues by&#13;
improving the monitoring and enforcement capacities of Yunnan's provincial and&#13;
municipal EPBs by providing training, institutional development and equipment.&#13;
Competent enforcement of regulations would be enhanced by requiring the Kunming&#13;
Environmental Protection Bureau (KEPB) to carry out a time-bound Action Plan for&#13;
collecting pollution levies in Kunming.&#13;
1.22  The proposed project therefore responds to Bank Group experience and CAS&#13;
objectives for the environment and infrastructure development.  Environmental&#13;
amelioration would be enhanced by an improved regulatory environment, protection of&#13;
critical water and land resources, and reduction of current pollution loads. Infrastructure&#13;
expansion would benefit from investment in wastewater and solid waste collection and&#13;
treatment as well as in water supply expansion, commercialization of operating agencies,&#13;
an improved tariff policy to fund maintenance of the existing systems as well as their&#13;
future expansion, and modem operating techniques. The Bank Group's strategy flows&#13;
from and supports China's Environmental Action Plan and Agenda 21, which provide the&#13;
basis for joint Government and Bank action in the environmental sector, especially in&#13;
regard to the urban environment.  The provincial focus recognizes the effective&#13;
decentralization of regulatory and investment authority in China, and draws on local&#13;
political power and commitment to induce wider use of the solutions to be demonstrated&#13;
under the project.&#13;
1.23  Further, the project supports the Bank Group's increasingly sharper focus on&#13;
China's poorer areas, where environmental challenges often go unaddressed for lack of&#13;
resources and expertise. It complements a range of other Bank Group-assisted projects&#13;
targeted at the poorest part of Yunnan's population, including $62 million under the&#13;
Southwest Poverty Reduction Project (FY95); and lesser arnounts under the&#13;
Comprehensive Maternal and Child Health Project (FY94), the Education Development&#13;
in Poor Provinces Project (FY92); Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (FY92); the&#13;
Third Rural Credit Project (FY88); and the proposed Fourth Basic Education Project,&#13;
now being prepared. While the project proposed here is not expected to directly affect&#13;
the very poorest, it is likely to benefit relatively poor rural migrants to the project cities.&#13;
Without project interventions to protect the water resources needed for sustained&#13;
economic growth, the absorption of poorer rural migrants by Kunming and the other&#13;
project cities would slow. Furthermore, continued economic growth at the municipal&#13;
level would generate provincial tax revenues to fund programs for the province's neediest&#13;
inhabitants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. ECONOMIC SETTING&#13;
2.1   Yunnan Province in southwestem China shares intemational borders (and rivers)&#13;
with Myanmar, Lao PDR and Viet Namn (Map IBRD 27911). The province has a current&#13;
population of 40 million, with the eastem half-a plateau-twice as densely populated as&#13;
the mountainous, riverine west. About a third of the population belongs to minority&#13;
groups, the largest proportion of any province in China. Yunnan is China's third poorest&#13;
province, with an average annual per capita income of about $134 equivalent in 1992.&#13;
Poverty is most severe in the mountainous areas where the inadequate resource base&#13;
keeps many inhabitants in absolute poverty, i.e., with annual per capita incomes below&#13;
Y300.&#13;
2.2   From a weak base, Yunnan's overall economy has been developing rapidly in the&#13;
past 15 years, with recent annual real growth rates of about 10 percent, largely owing to&#13;
growth in industry and services in the more prosperous eastem half. Agriculture,&#13;
employing most of the population, registered a respectable 5.4 percent growth rate during&#13;
1980-92, despite the generally mountainous topography and difficult growing conditions.&#13;
The industrial sector, employing about 10 percent of the labor force, showed robust&#13;
growth during the 1980-92 period, at an average 11.1 percent a year, and now accounts&#13;
for about 41 percent of the provincial gross domestic product (GDP). The service sector&#13;
grew even faster over this period, at an average 11.5 percent a year, and now contributes&#13;
almost 18 percent of GDP and employs another 10 percent of the labor force. During the&#13;
1990s, increased tourism to the province's striking natural and cultural endowments has&#13;
contributed to this development. Improvements in provincial road and rail transport and&#13;
opening of intemational borders with the three neighboring countries and thus to all of&#13;
Southeast Asia, with which Yunnan shares ethnic ties, should help sustain the momentum&#13;
for industrial and service sector growth in the province.&#13;
2.3   Yunnan's 1993 urban population was a relatively low 17 percent of total&#13;
population, and officially grew only 0.9 percent a year from 1980 to 1993. However,&#13;
those growth rates do not capture the large influx of migrants who have not gained&#13;
official urban status, nor do they reflect the dynamic growth of small towns. If town and&#13;
city populations are combined, nearly 43 percent of Yunnanese live in, or near,&#13;
population centers with 3,000 or more people. With Yunnan's rapid industrial and&#13;
service sector growth, urbanization should continue at a high rate through the next decade&#13;
and beyond. Currently, about 38 percent of all economic output is generated in the&#13;
province's 11 cities, with Kunming, the provincial capital, generating more than 15&#13;
percent of gross provincial output.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
2.4   The combination of rapid urbanization and income growth has put great pressure&#13;
on urban environmental services. Flush toilets are replacing pit latrines and indoor water&#13;
connections encourage the use of washing machines and other water-using appliances.&#13;
Thus, to the water demand that comes with an expanding population and industrial base is&#13;
added that from higher per capita incomes. But for most Yunnan cities, additional water&#13;
must come from ever more distant sources and at ever increasing real cost. The same&#13;
forces leading to higher water demand have increased effluent loads on receiving waters.&#13;
While nightsoil from latrines is composted for use on fields, that from flush toilets settles&#13;
in septic tanks, with the overflow draining to urban waterways or, more rarely, sewers.&#13;
Only Kunming has sewage treatment-two plants-that currently handle about 20&#13;
percent of Kunming's wastewater. Domestic solid wastes are increasing in volume and&#13;
shifting from a combination of coal ash and household organic wastes to an ever more&#13;
difficult to handle mix of traditional materials and packaging, plastic, and other modem&#13;
materials. Heretofore, Yunnan has lacked the sanitary landfills designed to safely handle&#13;
the leachate and methane generated in waste dumps. Urban services have lagged urban&#13;
and economic growth, but cannot continue to do so without slowing that growth.&#13;
2.5   Yunnan's industrial development has been based on a combination of agricultural&#13;
product processing and exploitation of abundant tin, iron ore, coal, and phosphate&#13;
resources. Although concentrated on urban areas, rural areas with rich resources have&#13;
developed township and village enterprises (TVEs) to exploit them. The dispersed nature&#13;
of some of this development, and the relatively high absorptive capacity of the&#13;
environment in the early stage of industrialization, led to relaxed application of national&#13;
industrial pollution control standards. But now the combination of urban and industrial&#13;
pollution loads has, in key population centers, destroyed potable water sources, reduced&#13;
agricultural and fishery output, ended recreational water use and led to human illness.&#13;
Environmental controls have tightened, but with the historical legacy of pollution&#13;
intensive industrial plant and lack of wastewater treatment, deterioration has only slowed,&#13;
not been reversed.&#13;
B. THE PROJECT AREAS&#13;
2.6   The cities and their rural hinterlands selected to benefit from the proposed&#13;
investments exemplify the development successes and environmental problems in&#13;
Yunnan (see Annex 1). Kunming, the provincial capital and engine of provincial&#13;
economic growth, holds some 1.2 million people and generates more than 15 percent of&#13;
gross provincial output. Lake Dianchi, source of half of the city's water supply, has been&#13;
reduced from a pristine Grade II quality to below Grade V, the lowest usable level, in&#13;
only 20 years. Qujing, Yunnan's fastest growing city, with over 210,000 people,&#13;
generates an additional 4 percent of gross provincial output. Irrigation water from the&#13;
Nanpanjiang, which cuts through Qujing, began killing crops in downstream villages in&#13;
1990, and had to be abandoned for that and drinking water use by villagers, who were&#13;
forced to turn to much more expensive well water for drinking and unreliable rainfall for&#13;
field crops. Gejiu, an industrial city of 215,000 built around a tin mining and smelting&#13;
operation, adjoins a lake formed by a 1954 landslide. Industrial and domestic pollution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
always prevented the use of the lake for drinking water, although it has continued as an&#13;
industrial water source despite falling to Grade V in the 1970s. Gejiu, which is growing&#13;
more slowly than Kunming and Qujing, produces about I percent of gross provincial&#13;
output.&#13;
Kunming and Lake Dianchi&#13;
2.7   Virtually all of Kunming lies upstream of Lake Dianchi, and historically those&#13;
wastewater discharges drained to the lake, with those from the city proper going largely&#13;
to the small Caohai (or inner lake) connected by a narrow neck of water to the much&#13;
larger Waihai (or outer lake). The discharges included domestic waste and that from such&#13;
industrial operations as nonferrous smelting operations, steel mills, fertilizer plants, a&#13;
pesticide plant, and some 10 paper mills. Over 5,000 industrial enterprises now operate&#13;
in Kunming. Most plants include some type of wastewater treatment, but most of the&#13;
treatment facilities operate below capacity or only part time. A municipal wastewater&#13;
treatment plant commissioned in 1991 captures and treats about 10 percent of the&#13;
domestic wastewater, but the rest discharges untreated. The lake itself discharges into the&#13;
Tanglangchuan River, still within Kunming's political boundaries, from which paper,&#13;
steel, and other industries draw river water and to which they discharge wastes.&#13;
2.8   Although discharges of toxic heavy metals and other industrial byproducts have&#13;
led to episodic closure of raw water intakes and a concern with eating lake aquatic&#13;
products, those toxic discharges have been largely controlled. Today, massive algae&#13;
blooms give the most visible evidence of lake pollution and, along with water hyacinth,&#13;
cause the greatest problems for lake use. Investigation into the nutrient cycle feeding the&#13;
algae has shown phosphorus to be the limiting nutrient, and hence strategies to control&#13;
lake pollution now focus on reducing phosphorus. As a measure of lake pollution, total&#13;
phosphorus stayed stable and below 0.03 mg/l through 1970, then began an accelerating&#13;
increase, but remained below 0.05 mg/l until nearly 1980. By 1995 the level had reached&#13;
0.2 mg/l, and if inputs continue unabated, will reach an estimated 0.3 mg/l by 2000 and&#13;
nearly 0.6 mg/l by 2010. Eutrophication, the loss of dissolved oxygen due to algae&#13;
blooms, typically begins at phosphorus concentrations of about 0.2 mg/l, and did so in&#13;
Dianchi.&#13;
2.9   As late as 1975, water quality across the lake held within Grade II. At that time,&#13;
Kunming residents swam in the lake, the fishing industry harvested 10,000 tons of fish&#13;
annually, rural villagers on the lake margin used it for cooking, washing, and irrigation&#13;
water, and a modest tourist industry was built around lake cruises. The city drew water&#13;
for municipal supply for a treatment plant on the north shore of the lake and built another&#13;
in 1990 on the better situated eastern shore. By 1995, fish harvests were down to&#13;
6,500 tons of lower grade species, swimming and other water contact had ended, as had&#13;
the lake cruises. The northern water intake has been permanently closed and the eastern&#13;
one provides supplementary supply to higher quality reservoir water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
2.10  The destruction of Dianchi cannot be attributed to industrial and domestic waste&#13;
alone. Here, as in many areas of China, political campaigns began as early as the 1950s&#13;
to expand cultivated land through massive infilling of the wetlands that once girded the&#13;
lake. This reduced the Caohai area from 12 km 2 before 1970 to only 8 km' by 1990.&#13;
Losses were not as drastic in percentage terms for the Waihai, but the loss of nutrient&#13;
absorptive capacity and aquatic nurseries represented by the wetlands has played a critical&#13;
role in the water quality decline and the decline of aquatic diversity.&#13;
2.11  The Yunnan and Kunming EPBs are charged with enforcing the environmental&#13;
laws and regulations that have, since the mid-1970s, been continually developed. In&#13;
recognition of the special problems of a lake basin, another institution, the Dianchi Lake&#13;
Protection Commission, was formed in 1988 to enforce a basinwide management strategy&#13;
over which the EPBs have no authority. For example, the Protection Commission&#13;
enforces the restriction against any further landfill of the lake. It reports to the People's&#13;
Congress in Kunming.&#13;
2.12  The EPBs and the Protection Authority have had mixed success. Any attempt by&#13;
them to shut down a heavily polluting operation, or to impose punitive fines or other&#13;
sanctions, must be agreed by the municipal authorities. Because severe regulatory action&#13;
typically means the loss of jobs or income to urban workers, or, worse, to their poorer&#13;
rural brethren, agreement can be hard to obtain. Rather, the authorities attempt first to&#13;
identify sources of capital that will allow enterprise renovation sufficient to bring it&#13;
within discharge standards. Years might pass before they achieve this, and in the&#13;
meantime discharges continue. Nonetheless, much has been done in recent years. One&#13;
highly polluting smelter has routed treated discharges past the lake and into a downstream&#13;
reach of the Tanglangchuan River. The Caohai has been isolated from the Waihai by a&#13;
dike and gate, and a tunnel 4 meters in diameter built to route Caohai water-which&#13;
receives 50 percent of all urban wastes-to the Tanglangchuan downstream of the major&#13;
industries. And funding has been identified for a number of environmental investments.&#13;
2.13 Wastewater System. The Kunming Drainage Company (KDC), a government-&#13;
owned but autonomous agency, is responsible for collection and treatment of sewage&#13;
discharged by residents and businesses in the municipal area. A sewerage master plan for&#13;
Kunming was prepared with technical assistance from the Government of Switzerland,&#13;
and approved in 1990. The city center has four drainage areas, all sewered. About 55&#13;
percent of the population have plumbing in their homes and another 25 percent use&#13;
communal toilets connected to the sewerage system. One wastewater treatment plant was&#13;
constructed in 1991 and another, built with Swedish Government assistance, was just&#13;
commissioned. Two other plants are being built, one with Australian Government&#13;
support, the other self-financed.  Total treatment capacity of these four plants is&#13;
365,000 m3/day, compared to current discharges of 400,000 m3/day and projected&#13;
wastewater flows of around 600,000 m3/day by the year 2010.&#13;
2.14  Cost recovery on wastewater and drainage services is low. Charges imposed on&#13;
large industries do not cover even the operating and maintenance costs of providing this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
service, and domestic consumers pay no charge. However, the Provincial Government&#13;
has recognized the need to make progress toward full cost recovery on enviromnental&#13;
services, and is expected to make tariff adjustments. Tariffs on industrial wastewater are&#13;
expected to rise from Y 0.08/m3 on 80 percent of water consumption to Y 0.35/m3 on&#13;
100 percent of water consumption, and the same tariff of Y 0.35/m3 would be levied on&#13;
households. The break-even financial performance target for KDC under the proposed&#13;
project will require further tariff increases (para. 5.21).&#13;
2.15  Water Supply System. Apart from a minor groundwater source, Kunming draws&#13;
its water supply about equally from Lake Dianchi and from the Songhuaba Reservoir on&#13;
the Panlong River, 13 km northeast of Kunming.  (The Reservoir was originally&#13;
constructed for irrigation, but agriculture, industry and domestic users now compete for&#13;
its water.) About 85 percent of the city's population is connected to the water supply&#13;
system, which includes six water treatment plants, with a design capacity of about&#13;
480,000 m3/day. Four of these plants treat water for Songhuaba Reservoir and two treat&#13;
Dianchi Lake water; one of the latter has been closed due to difficulties in sustaining&#13;
treatment processes because of poor water quality. The system is operated by the&#13;
Kunming Water Supply Company (KWSC), discussed further in Chapter 4. The&#13;
system's most pressing physical needs are for expansion of connections into still-&#13;
unserved suburban areas, rehabilitation of existing facilities to reduce leakage&#13;
(unaccounted-for water is reported at 10 to 12 percent but is thought to be considerably&#13;
higher), protection of current raw water sources, and identification of new ones.&#13;
2.16  Even more important is the introduction of demand management measures, since&#13;
water demand now exceeds economically sustainable supply in dry years, and will do so&#13;
increasingly in the future. With no special measures taken, by the year 2020, demand is&#13;
expected to increase from the current 538,000 m3/day to 953,000 m3/day. Current&#13;
demand is driven by two factors: a recent fall in the real cost of water due to inflation&#13;
and increasing real incomes. The Provincial Government, spurred by discussions with&#13;
the Bank Group during project preparation, recently authorized the first water tariff&#13;
increase since early 1993, and domestic tariffs rose from Y 0.32/mr  to Y 0.60/m3.&#13;
Despite the tariff doubling, the new rates are considered affordable, representing only&#13;
about 0.6 percent of per capita income. To meet Yunnan Provincial Government's&#13;
(YPG's) financial objectives for the water supply sector in Kunming, further tariff&#13;
increases, complemented by measures promoting water conservation and leakage&#13;
reduction, are still needed, and are proposed under the project (para. 5.17).&#13;
2.17  Solid Waste Management. The city currently disposes of its domestic and&#13;
commercial solid waste at two dumps, neither of which meet national sanitary treatment&#13;
standards. Another five dumps containing large quantities of waste have been virtually&#13;
filled, giving rise to continuing leachate pollution and requiring urgent remediation.&#13;
Disposal of industrial solid waste is the responsibility of the generating enterprise, under&#13;
the supervision of the Kunming Environmental Protection Bureau (KEPB).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Qujing&#13;
2.18  Qujing, Yunnan's fastest-growing city with a population of some 220,000, lies on&#13;
the Nanpanjiang River, a tributary of the Pearl River (Map IBRD 27911). The city is&#13;
undergoing swift expansion and expects to double its population over the next decade.&#13;
Like Kunming, Qujing is a water-short area, but with little treatment of the increasing&#13;
amounts of domestic and industrial wastewater. The Qujing portion of the Nanpanjiang&#13;
is already heavily polluted, with water quality rated worse than Class V in the dry season.&#13;
Recently, use of the river water for even irrigation was curtailed because water&#13;
contamination was so severe that it killed crops. The causes of these problems are similar&#13;
to those in Kunming, although here the river removes the wastewater from the city&#13;
boundaries. Municipal growth has also generated greatly increased quantities of solid&#13;
waste, which is disposed of at a poorly managed dump.&#13;
Gejiu&#13;
2.19  Gejiu, a city of some 134,000 people, is physically built around a lake and&#13;
economically built around a large state-owned zinc mine and tin smelter. It also suffers&#13;
from severe environmental strains due to the lack of any wastewater treatment facilities&#13;
(Map IBRD 27911). The water quality in Lake Gejiu is now worse than Class V&#13;
standard. Flood control is also a problem, and the threat of flooding constrains the city's&#13;
development. Decades of mining, pollution by nonferrous industries, and rapid growth of&#13;
TVEs have caused great destruction to the Gejiu environment, and have intensified&#13;
problems of water supply, soil erosion and lake sedimentation.&#13;
C. THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT'S ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGY&#13;
2.20  Recognizing the problems exemplified above, YP in 1993 issued a strong&#13;
statement on the need to reverse the province's environmental decline and initiated&#13;
various actions aimed at achieving this goal.  Among other things, the Yunnan&#13;
Environmental Protection Bureau (YEPB) and EPB offices at the prefectural, municipal&#13;
and county levels supplemented their normal duties (i.e., monitoring environmental&#13;
conditions, enforcing environmental laws and regulations on industrial activities, and&#13;
collecting pollution levies) with measures to reverse the environmental deterioration that&#13;
has accompanied growth.&#13;
2.21  First, the Province prepared and began to implement the "1722" Project to:&#13;
(a) control 100 serious industrial polluting sources by 1997 (of which 42 have been&#13;
addressed thus far); (b) control gaseous emissions over 70 km2 of urban area (now&#13;
completed); (c) add capacity to treat an additional 0.2 million tons per day (tpd) of&#13;
domestic wastewater; and (d) reverse the pollution of two water bodies-Lake Dianchi&#13;
and the Nanpanjiang River. Second, Kunming Municipality established the Lake Dianchi&#13;
Protection Authority, which has overseen construction of the tunnel, intended to increase&#13;
the lake's flood protection capacity and to prevent the polluted waters of the Caohai from&#13;
entering the Waihai, thus protecting the water supply intakes on the lake and the upper&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
reaches of the Tanglangchuan River. The Caohai, which accounts for 2.5 percent of the&#13;
lake area, receives about 50 percent of Kunming's wastewater.&#13;
2.22  Third, Dianchi Lake water will be pumped 19 km for irrigation use, freeing the&#13;
high quality Songhuaba Reservoir water for Kunming's water supply. Fourth, water&#13;
demand management initiatives have been introduced, including tariff increases to reflect&#13;
the production cost of water, the establishment of a Water Conservation Office to help&#13;
reduce wastage, and limited network rehabilitation to reduce unaccounted-for water.&#13;
Finally, other regulatory actions and incentives have been implemented to protect the&#13;
catchment, such as encouraging the relocation of industry outside the catchment and&#13;
banning the further establishment of polluting industries inside the catchment. With&#13;
response to some of the environmental issues, these actions have proved sufficient. A&#13;
long-term solution requires effluent reductions at source, or, where more economic,&#13;
collective treatment.&#13;
D. FORMULATION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
2.23  To build on these initiatives and to follow up studies funded by the Government&#13;
of Norway, the Province secured assistance from the Overseas Development&#13;
Administration (ODA) of the United Kingdom, which funded design review and advisory&#13;
(DRA) consultants, to develop a Dianchi Environmental Action Plan (DEAP) and similar&#13;
plans for Qujing and Gejiu, and support YP in project preparation. Support for the&#13;
preparation of the Environmental and Water Quality Monitoring component of the&#13;
proposed project was also provided by the Canadian International Development&#13;
Authority(CIDA). Bank Group support for the proposed project, to implement priority&#13;
measures included in the plans, was then requested. The overall objective of the project&#13;
is to tackle the immediate and underlying causes of environmental degradation in the&#13;
project cities. In Kunming and the Dianchi Catchment, this focuses on the protection of&#13;
Lake Dianchi and ensuring its use as a continued source of potable water for Kunning.&#13;
In Gejiu and Qujing, improved wastewater management would be the focus of project&#13;
support, with the aim of preventing untreated waste entering water bodies. The water&#13;
supply systems of Kunning and Qujing would also be expanded.&#13;
2.24  As recommended in the DEAP, reducing the rate of growth of phosphorus&#13;
concentrations in the lake, which result from domestic waste and industrial effluent&#13;
(particularly from two large fertilizer factories), is the first priority and would therefore&#13;
be the project's chief physical goal. Phosphorus, and to a lesser extent nitrogen, is&#13;
considered the limiting factor in Dianchi's eutrophication. Other nutrients and toxic&#13;
nutrients, including organic matter and heavy metals, would also decline. To this end, the&#13;
proposed project would expand the sewer system in Kunming and link it to treatment&#13;
plants now being constructed; provide the additional wastewater treatment capacity still&#13;
needed; extend the water supply system to the city's expanding suburban areas; and&#13;
provide sanitary landfills to reduce leachate entering water sources from existing&#13;
unregulated dumpsites. Reducing industrial pollution from the fertilizer plants and other&#13;
major polluters identified in the area would also be supported, as would key institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
improvements and policy reforms required for long-term environmental amelioration.&#13;
Similar physical and institutional measures would be carried out in Qujing and Gejiu.&#13;
2.25  The proposed interventions in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment are&#13;
expected to reduce overall phosphorus loads to Lake Dianchi in 2010 by 50 percent,&#13;
bringing the loads to 30 percent below those in 1995, despite the substantial population&#13;
growth in the catchment over the intervening period.&#13;
2.26  The subsequent phase of environmnental actions and investments in Yunnan would&#13;
be identified from the DEAP and from a Dianchi Watershed Management Plan covering&#13;
rural areas in the catchment, including mines and the now largely unregulated TVEs. The&#13;
plan is being updated with ongoing assistance from ODA through the DRA consultant.&#13;

3. THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The project is part of a phased development program of Yunnan Province (YP) to&#13;
improve environmental conditions and sustain urban services management. The principal&#13;
objective of the project is to provide a sustainable environmental framework for the long&#13;
term economic and social development of the Province, while providing a conducive&#13;
foundation for industrial growth. Specific objectives of the project are to: (a) strengthen&#13;
policies, regulations and institutional arrangements for pollution control, and municipal&#13;
water, wastewater, solid waste and nightsoil management; (b) support the improvement&#13;
of the lakes environment in Gejiu and Kunming in order to allow the waters to be used&#13;
for potable supply, industry or agriculture, as appropriate; (c) facilitate complementary&#13;
sustainable investments in pollution control and municipally-provided urban&#13;
environmental services; and (d) introduce a comprehensive approach to planning,&#13;
prioritization, management, and financing of urban environmental infrastructure&#13;
investments.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2   The project would comprise a mix of policy and investment initiatives. The&#13;
policy initiatives would support a stronger market orientation for municipal service&#13;
pricing, and the concerned utility enterprises and EPBs would be strengthened through&#13;
technical assistance and training. Investments would support municipal strategies for&#13;
environmental recovery and sustained use of natural resources, principally water. A&#13;
detailed description is given in Annex 2. A summary description of the five core project&#13;
components is given below.  The indicated costs include physical and price&#13;
contingencies.&#13;
(a)   Lake Dianchi Basin Water Quality Recovery.  Investments would&#13;
support the Dianchi Environmental Action Plan (DEAP), and would include&#13;
control of point and nonpoint pollution in the Dianchi Lake Basin, through&#13;
improved catchment management, wastewater and stormwater collection,&#13;
treatment and disposal, including wastewater treatment in the county towns&#13;
of Chenggong and Jinning; improved collection, transport and disposal of&#13;
municipal solid waste and nightsoil; remediation of polluting practices&#13;
causing lake eutrophication; and measures to strengthen Dianchi Lake basin&#13;
management and safeguard the long-term quality of water resources; and&#13;
improvements to basin water resource allocation, to ensure that the highest&#13;
quality water is used for the most quality-sensitive uses such as for potable&#13;
supply. The latter would be supported through investments in upgraded&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
trunk and distribution water mains, water treatment, and associated actions&#13;
and facilities including rural sanitation investments in the Songhuaba&#13;
Reservoir and Dianchi basin catchment areas to protect and increase the&#13;
water supply in Kunming;                         $199.6 million&#13;
(b)   Industrial Pollution Control. Direct investment financial support would&#13;
be provided to abate industrial pollution from enterprises identified in the&#13;
DEAP as most threatening to Dianchi Lake basin resources. Enterprises&#13;
have been ranked according to environmental impact. The cleanup would&#13;
focus on two fertilizer plants, found to be the top-ranked industrial polluters&#13;
in terms of phosphorus load to Dianchi Lake. Support to abate pollution&#13;
from lower-ranked enterprises requiring smaller investments would be&#13;
through an Environmental Pollution Control Subloans (EPCSL) Facility;&#13;
$34.1 million&#13;
(c)   Provincial Urban Environmental Services. Investments in catchment&#13;
management, wastewater and stormwater collection and treatment systems&#13;
for the protection of Gejiu Lake and Qujing's Nanpanjiang River; selective&#13;
investments in water supply system extensions in Qujing; and improved&#13;
collection, transport and disposal of municipal solid waste and nightsoil in&#13;
Qujing;                                           $48.6 million&#13;
(d)   Environmental and Water Quality Monitoring. Support for upgrading&#13;
and modemizing environmental management and water quality information&#13;
and monitoring systems.                            $6.2 million&#13;
(e)   Institutional Development, Training and Construction Supervision.&#13;
Strengthening provincial, municipal, project, and financial management;&#13;
construction supervision services; training in utility operations; updating of&#13;
city environmental action plans and feasibility studies; and future project&#13;
preparation.                                      $19.1 million&#13;
TOTAL ESTIMATED PROJECT COST                     $307.6 million&#13;
3.3   The financial, urban environment service delivery and utility management policy&#13;
initiatives would concentrate on (a) operational efficiency improvements; (b) resource&#13;
mobilization and cost recovery measures; (c) underpinning of long-term financial and&#13;
economic sustainability; and (d) industrial pollution reduction through focused time-&#13;
bound Action Plans with respect to pollution from paper, steel and pesticides. The&#13;
institutional development and training component would enhance policies and operational&#13;
experience in environmental protection and water, wastewater, municipal solid waste and&#13;
nightsoil management. Support to these initiatives has been grouped into a number of&#13;
main composite packages for the various executing agencies, covering institutional&#13;
development, financial management improvement, construction supervision and training.&#13;
The component would also support provincial and sector city agencies, master planning,&#13;
future project preparation, and other programs of assistance to be defined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
3.4    YP has prepared and updated a strategy and time-bound Implementation Schedule&#13;
for the Institutional Development and Training component for implementation according&#13;
to an agreed schedule. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that YP would&#13;
implement the Institutional Development and Training component in accordance with a&#13;
schedule acceptable to the Bank/IDA, and discuss and agree any revisions to the schedule&#13;
with the Bank/IDA. The signing of contracts with consulting firms for institutional&#13;
development, financial management improvement, construction supervision and sector&#13;
institutional strengthening for the executing agencies is a condition of disbursement of&#13;
loan/credit proceeds (see para. 3.25).&#13;
C. PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
3.5    Project impact would be monitored with respect to the project objectives, for&#13;
which the key indicators are shown below. The physical progress of implementation&#13;

3.8       Base  cost estimates  reflect preliminary  engineering  designs  and  price  levels&#13;
expected to prevail in June 1996, based on current inflation rates. The unit prices were&#13;
derived from the following sources: (a) quotations obtained from manufacturers and&#13;
suppliers; (b) prices of goods and works from recent contracts; and (c) construction costs&#13;
according to prices published by the Central and Yunnan Governments, all adjusted for&#13;
inflation.       Physical  contingencies  have   been   applied   to   all  components  except&#13;
environmental pollution control subloans (EPCSL). Physical contingencies of 15 percent&#13;
have been applied to base costs for most components, except for vehicles and mechanical&#13;
equipment of the solid waste and nightsoil management components, and priority water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
supply and wastewater contracts, where 10 percent has been adopted to reflect the&#13;
confidence level of the estimated costs of these components. Construction Supervision&#13;
Services costs estimated at 2.5 percent of the civil works and materials and equipment&#13;
costs of the water and wastewater component, and 1.25 percent of the civil works of the&#13;
environmental services improvements component, have been included in the project cost&#13;
estimates. Project management and engineering overhead costs of 10 percent are also&#13;
included.&#13;
3.9   Price contingencies have been applied to expenditures at projected global foreign&#13;
and local inflation rates. In view of the large variation between foreign and local price&#13;
contingency projections, the dollar/yuan exchange rate has been assumed to vary in order&#13;
to maintain purchasing power parity. The inflation rate projections used are as follows:&#13;

3.11  China is eligible for single currency loans under the Bank's expanded program.&#13;
The Government of China and the Yunnan Provincial Government have selected LIBOR-&#13;
based US dollar single currency loan terms for the project in order to facilitate&#13;
management of the foreign exchange risk of their borrowings by more closely matching&#13;
the currency of their liabilities with that of their net trade flows, about 60 percent of&#13;
which are US dollar-denominated. The LIBOR-based product was selected in order to&#13;
preserve the full maturity of the loan, compared to the fixed-rate option that would have&#13;
resulted in a 15-year loan. The Borrower judges that it can manage any interest rate risk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
This loan, when added to previous single currency loans made to China in FY96, is&#13;
within the 50 percent volume guideline approved by the Bank's Board.&#13;
3.12 The IBRD loan and IDA credit would be made to the People's Republic of China.&#13;
The loan of $125 million would be for a 20-year term, including a 5-year grace period at&#13;
the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans. The IDA&#13;
credit of SDR 17.4 million ($25 million equivalent) would be for a 35-year term,&#13;
including a 10-year grace period on standard Association terms. The proceeds of the loan&#13;
and credit would be made available through YP to the municipalities on the following&#13;
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank/IDA: the loan at the standard interest rate&#13;
for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans, for a 17-year period including a 5-year&#13;
grace period, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per year, and the credit at the&#13;
Association's standard service charge for a 20-year period, including a 5-year grace&#13;
period, and a commitment charge of 0.50 percent per year. Yunnan Province, and then&#13;
the municipalities, would bear the foreign exchange risks. Assurances were obtained&#13;
during negotiations from YP that (a) it would onlend to Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer&#13;
Factory, and cause Kunming Municipality to relend to Kunming Chemical Fertilizer&#13;
Factory part of the loan/credit proceeds for the Industrial Pollution Control component,&#13;
on the following terms: at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single&#13;
currency loans plus a spread of not less than 1.5 percent per year, with the enterprises&#13;
bearing the commitment charges of 0. 75 percent and the foreign exchange risks, the&#13;
maturity would be for 10 years, including a 3-year period of grace; subsidiary loan&#13;
agreements would be entered into between Yunnan and Kunming and the two enterprises;&#13;
and (b) it would cause Gejiu, Kunming and Qujing Municipalities to relend part of the&#13;
loan/credit proceeds onlent to them to their water and wastewater utility companies on&#13;
the following terms. at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single&#13;
currency loans, with the entities bearing the commitment charges and the foreign&#13;
exchange risks; the maturity would be for 15 years, including a 5-year period of grace.&#13;
3.13  Execution of subsidiary loan agreements between the project municipalities and&#13;
their water and wastewater utility companies, satisfactory to the BanklIDA, is a condition&#13;
of effectiveness.  A separate Project Agreement, including operational, financial and&#13;
monitoring covenants, would be executed between YP and IBRD/IDA.&#13;
3.14  About $5.0 million equivalent of the loan/credit proceeds would be onlent by YP&#13;
from a revolving credit facility (Environmental Pollution Control Subloans-EPCSL) to&#13;
participating enterprises for eligible small-scale pollution control subprojects. Assurances&#13;
were obtained during negotiations that (a) YP would onlend to participating enterprises at&#13;
the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans plus a spread&#13;
of not less than 1.5 percent per year, with the enterprises bearing a commitment charge of&#13;
0.75 percent and the foreign exchange risk The maturity would be for three to five years,&#13;
including a one to two year period of grace. Subloan repayments would be recycled for&#13;
additional pollution control subprojects to the extent not needed to repay the loan to China;&#13;
and (b) YP would allocate to the account of EPCSL a total of about Y 42.0 million over the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
three fiscal years commencing 1997, annually depositing to the Account at least Y 14&#13;
million by June 30 of each such year.&#13;
F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.15  Procurement procedures and arrangements satisfactory to the Bank/IDA were&#13;
agreed upon with YP. All procurement would be undertaken in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Procurement Guidelines, January 1995 and revised in January 1996. Activities&#13;
would be organized through the China National Instruments International Tendering&#13;
Company (CNIITC), which has been contracted by the Yunnan Environment Project&#13;
Office (YEPO) on behalf of the implementing agencies and YP to carry out the work.&#13;
CNIITC is an experienced and competent procurement agent that is familiar with, and has&#13;
had recent and relevant experience in international competitive bidding (ICB) work on&#13;
Bank/IDA-financed projects. The tender documents to be used in the project would be&#13;
based on the current version of model bidding documents agreed between the World&#13;
Bank Group and the Government. All works contracts would be grouped whenever&#13;
practical into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $6 million or more each,&#13;
and contracts for goods shall be grouped into packages estimated to cost the equivalent of&#13;
$250,000 or more each, to attract maximum international competition. Prequalification&#13;
of bidders would be undertaken for goods contracts for treatment equipment with an&#13;
estimated value over $4.0 million equivalent each. For all contracts estimated to cost $10&#13;
million or more, invitations for prequalification or for bids would be advertised as Special&#13;
Procurement Notices published in Development Business and/or well-known technical&#13;
magazines, newspapers and trade publications of wide international circulation. Annex 4&#13;
lists the Schedule of Contract Packages and the method of procurement, and Table 3.3&#13;
summarizes the procurement categories and the expected procurement methods. The&#13;
contract packages and the method of procurement have been agreed with YEPO and the&#13;
implementing agencies.&#13;
3.16  Civil Works. Excluding the industrial pollution control revolving credit facility,&#13;
there is a total of about $154.5 million of civil works of which about $73.8 million (48&#13;
percent) would be procured using ICB procedures. Qualified domestic contractors under&#13;
ICB will be eligible for a 7.5 percent preference in bid evaluation, in accordance with the&#13;
Guidelines. ICB procedures would be used for all civil works contracts of estimated value&#13;
over $6.0 million (i.e., 5 contracts). All remaining civil works are too small, scattered or&#13;
scheduled too far apart to be packaged to be of interest to foreign firms. Of the remaining&#13;
works, about $79.6 million would be awarded through national competitive bidding (NCB)&#13;
procedures, acceptable to the Bank/IDA. The NCB procedures recently adopted by the&#13;
Government have been reviewed and approved by the World Bank Group. Interested&#13;
foreign bidders would be allowed to bid for NCB contracts.&#13;
3.17  Equipment and Materials. Excluding the industrial pollution control revolving&#13;
credit facility, there is a total of about $81.4 million of equipment and materials in the&#13;
project, of which about $74.4 million (92 percent) would be procured using ICB&#13;
procedures. Qualified domestic bidders will be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
15 percent of the CIF price or customs duties and import tax payable by a nonexempt&#13;
importer, whichever is less. All equipment and materials with individual contract values of&#13;
$250,000 or more equivalent would be procured using ICB procedures. Equipment and&#13;
materials with individual contract values less than $250,000 equivalent would be awarded&#13;
using NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank, up to an aggregate amount of $1.5 million.&#13;
Contracts costing $50,000 equivalent or less up to an aggregate amount of about $1.5&#13;
million, would be procured through national shopping procedures with at least three price&#13;
quotations.&#13;

3.18   Direct Contracting.  Direct contracting (not Bank/IDA-financed), amounting to&#13;
about $5.1 million, will be used for: (a) contracts to be made with the local power&#13;
companies to provide electricity supplies to the pump stations, buildings and facilities under&#13;
the project; (b) railway crossings; and (c) other utility services.&#13;
3.19 Industrial Pollution Control Subloans. Under this subcomponent, which would&#13;
be operated by the Yunnan Finance Bureau-YFB (see para. 4.13), no subloan will exceed&#13;
$500,000. Contracts for equipment and materials financed through subloans up to a facility&#13;
total of $10.0 million would be awarded, after solicitation and evaluation through national&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
shopping procedures with at least three written price quotations from eligible suppliers (see&#13;
Annex 12 for details of EPCSL operations). This is consistent with procedures that the&#13;
Bank Group has reviewed and found satisfactory. These contracts would be subject to&#13;
postreview by the Bank/IDA, and YEPO would maintain all relevant documents in its&#13;
records for this purpose.&#13;
3.20  Technical Assistance and Training. All consultants to be retained under the&#13;
project would be recruited in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency-&#13;
August 1981." National consultants and counterpart staff would be engaged or assigned by&#13;
the concerned agencies of Yunnan Province. Consultants would be engaged using the&#13;
Bank's Standard Formn of Contract for Consultants' Services-June 1995. Drafts of Letters&#13;
of Invitation, Terms of Reference and a short list of consultants for institutional and&#13;
financial technical assistance, construction supervision services, and sector institutional&#13;
strengthening for Packages A and B (for the Kunming Drainage Company, and the&#13;
Kunming Water Supply Company respectively) were reviewed and found satisfactory prior&#13;
to appraisal. Details of the institutional development and training component are set out in&#13;
Annex 2. The signing of contracts between YP and consulting firms for such assistance is a&#13;
condition of disbursement of loan/credit proceeds (para. 3.25). The Terms of Reference for&#13;
these consultancy services are in the Project File (Annex 16).&#13;
3.21   Review of Bid Documents and Contracts. All civil works packages (about 17&#13;
contracts, 80 percent of the works) of $2.5 million or more, and all equipment and materials&#13;
contracts (about 15 contracts, 92 percent of the equipment and materials) of $0.5 million or&#13;
more, would be subject to the Bank/IDA's normal pri-,r review, including prequalification,&#13;
notice of invitation to bid, bid documents, bid evaluation and contracts. The threshold for&#13;
prior review of contracts for consultants would be $100,000 equivalent for firms and&#13;
$50,000 for individual contracts, including the approval of budgets, short lists, selection&#13;
procedures, letters of invitation, proposal evaluation reports and contracts. Other contracts&#13;
would be subject to selective postaward review. An estimated 80 percent of the value of all&#13;
contracts proposed to be financed by the Bank/IDA would be subject to prior review.&#13;
However, all terms of reference for such contracts, any single-source selection of&#13;
consultants, assignments the Bank considers to be of a critical nature, and any amendments&#13;
to contracts that result in the contract exceeding the above-mentioned two thresholds would&#13;
require Bank/IDA prior review.&#13;
3.22  Prequalification.  The Standard Prequalification Document for the People's&#13;
Republic of China, issued by the Ministry of Finance and approved by the World Bank&#13;
Group, would be used for preparing the invitation document. YEPO and CNIITC hold&#13;
copies of this document (together with standard bidding documents for ICB and NCB&#13;
works and goods invitations).&#13;

G. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.23 The proposed IBRD loan of $125 million and IDA credit of SDR 17.4 million&#13;
($25 million equivalent) would be disbursed over a period of about six and a half years,&#13;
one year longer than the China disbursement profile for the water and sanitation sector.&#13;
The longer disbursement period for this project is considered justified given Yunnan is a&#13;
first-time borrower in the sector.&#13;

3.24  To expedite disbursements, a Special Account with an authorized allocation of&#13;
$8.0 million, representing about four months' average disbursements, would be&#13;
established. It would be replenished monthly or whenever the Special Account is drawn&#13;
down to 50 percent of its initial value, whichever occurs first. Disbursements would be&#13;
made against statements of expenditure (SOEs), confirmed by YEPO, for: (a) contracts&#13;
for (i) civil works valued at less than $2.5 million; and (ii) equipment and materials&#13;
costing less than $0.5 million equivalent; (b) contracts for consulting services costing less&#13;
than $100,000 equivalent for firms and $50,000 equivalent for individuals; and&#13;
(c) training. Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by YEPO and made&#13;
available for inspection during the course of Bank/IDA supervision missions and by&#13;
external auditors. All other disbursements will be made against fully documented&#13;
expenditures. A Schedule of Disbursements is given in Annex 5. The project is expected&#13;
to be completed by December 31, 2001, and, therefore, the Loan/Credit Closing Date&#13;
would be December 31, 2002.&#13;
3.25  The approval by the Bank/IDA of (a) operational regulations governing EPCSL&#13;
processing and approvals, and (b) the execution of an acceptable financial agency&#13;
agreement between YP and a bankfor EPCSL processing (para. 4.13 and Annex 12), would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
be conditions of disbursement for the loan/credit proceeds allocated to the Environmental&#13;
Pollution Control component. The execution of acceptable subsidiary loan agreements&#13;
between (i) Kunming and Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Factory, and (ii) Yunnan and&#13;
Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Factory (para. 3.12) would be conditions of disbursement&#13;
for the loanlcredit proceeds allocated to these investments. It will be a condition of&#13;
disbursement of the Lake Dianchi Basin Water Quality Recovery component that the&#13;
Bank/IDA receive (a) copies of signed contracts, acceptable to the Bank/IDA, between YP&#13;
and consulting firms, for institutional and financial technical assistance, construction&#13;
supervision services, and sector institutional strengthening with respect to KDC and KWSC&#13;
(para. 3.20); and (b) a financial forecast of KDC's operations for fiscal year 1997,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank/IDA, together with written confirmation that all wastewater tariff&#13;
increases included in the forecast have been approved by YP (see para. 5.14).&#13;
H. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
3.26  The project entails permanent acquisition of 215 hectares of land affecting 3,090&#13;
persons in Kunming, Qujing and Gejiu municipalities and some of the smaller towns in&#13;
Yunnan province. During project preparation, surveys of affected persons and properties&#13;
were carried out by the respective municipalities/counties with the involvement of&#13;
affected persons and their representatives. In addition to permanent land acquisition,&#13;
about 100 hectares of land would need to be leased temporarily during project&#13;
construction. The project would also affect four enterprises with 70 workers. A&#13;
preliminary socioeconomic survey of the affected persons has been conducted by the&#13;
project preparation team. Detailed socioeconomic surveys of affected persons will be&#13;
carried out before the initiation of the land acquisition and resettlement program.&#13;
3.27  Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). In order to ensure mitigation of adverse impacts&#13;
related to land acquisition and to facilitate the implementation of resettlement/rehabilitation&#13;
activities as a development program, YEPO has prepared a comprehensive Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan (RAP), covering all project components. The RAP, submitted to the Bank for&#13;
review before project appraisal, has been found to be generally in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's guidelines on resettlement. It was updated during appraisal. The RAP sets out: (a)&#13;
land acquisition and resettlement policies and principles; (b) baseline surveys; (c)&#13;
description of resettlement sites; (d) resettlement institutions; (e) implementation schedule;&#13;
(f) job creation; (g) costs and budget; (h) participation of project affected persons; (i)&#13;
grievance redress; and (j) monitoring and evaluation of RAP implementation.&#13;
3.28  Resettlement Strategies. A majority of the project affected persons (2,200 out of&#13;
3,090) would be rehabilitated through land redistribution within the same village unit.&#13;
About 600 new jobs would be provided for the economic rehabilitation of the remaining&#13;
890 affected persons.  Elderly affected persons would be offered old-age pensions.&#13;
Workers in affected enterprises would be paid a transition allowance in lieu of wages until&#13;
reconstruction of the affected enterprises. Compensation for all affected assets will be paid&#13;
at their full replacement value without any allowance being made for depreciation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
3.29  Resettlement Costs. The cost of implementation of the RAP has been included as a&#13;
part of the project budget. The total cost of RAP implementation is estimated at Y 171&#13;
million in January 1996 prices, including physical and price contingencies.&#13;
3.30 Implementation Arrangements. A Resettlement Coordination Group (RCG),&#13;
headed by the provincial Vice-Governor and with members from all the implementing&#13;
agencies has been formed by the provincial government to oversee the implementation of&#13;
the resettlement required. YP has given overall responsibility of RAP coordination to&#13;
YEPO, while the local municipal governments/counties, would be responsible for&#13;
implementing the RAP. A Resettlement Unit within YEPO would coordinate the&#13;
implementation of the various activities under the RAP.&#13;
3.31  Implementation of the RAP will be carried out in consultation with, and with the&#13;
participation of the affected persons and their representatives. A mechanism for redress&#13;
of grievances of affected persons and avenues for appeal have been established specially&#13;
for the project.&#13;
3.32  Monitoring and evaluation of RAP implementation will be carried out both&#13;
internally and externally. Intemal monitoring will be carried out quarterly by YEPO and&#13;
the respective municipal/county governments in formats that have been agreed with the&#13;
World Bank and have been included in the RAP. Specific monitoring indicators for intemal&#13;
monitoring have also been specified. Extemal monitoring and evaluation will be carried out&#13;
by the Southwest Jiaotong University on a biannual basis until one year after the completion&#13;
of the project. Extemal monitoring would concentrate on the qualitative aspects of&#13;
monitoring based on the monitoring indicators described in the RAP. The first external&#13;
monitoring report will be submitted to the Bank for review on October 1, 1996. Each&#13;
monitoring report will be discussed by the Resettlement Coordination Group (RCG) and&#13;
each report would summarize the progress of follow-up action initiated as a result of the&#13;
previous reports.&#13;
3.33  YP submitted an updated and acceptable RAP to the Bank prior to negotiations.&#13;
The framework for land acquisition and resettlement is presented in Annex 6. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom YP that it would cause YEPO, the municipal&#13;
and county governments and all other concerned agencies to (a) carry out the&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation of affected persons in a manner and according to a plan&#13;
(the RAP) that is satisfactory to the Bank/IDA; and (b) report quarterly on the progress&#13;
in carrying out the resettlement plan using monitoring indicators satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank/lIDA.&#13;
I. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.34  The proposed project is classified as Category A for purposes of Environmental&#13;
Assessment (EA), principally because of the three proposed landfills and the industrial&#13;
pollution control component. In accordance with Chinese regulations a comprehensive&#13;
EA was prepared covering all project components. This EA has been reviewed by NEPA&#13;
and the Bank/IDA and found to be satisfactory. The findings of the EA are summarized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
in Annex 7. The environmental impact of the project is, on balance, substantially positive&#13;
and the project will, in particular, result in major improvements in water quality. The&#13;
comprehensive program of removal of phosphorus from wastewater discharges to&#13;
Dianchi Lake will have substantial benefits in terms of arresting the eutrophication of&#13;
lake and permitting its sustained safe use for water supply and avoiding costly import of&#13;
water from distant catchments.&#13;
3.35  There are, however, some negative impacts that require mitigation. In particular,&#13;
the proposed landfill sites are to be lined and equipped with leachate collection systems.&#13;
Landfill gas will be collected and flared for safety reasons and to convert methane, a potent&#13;
greenhouse gas, to carbon dioxide. Appropriate arrangements have been made for the&#13;
beneficial use, wherever possible, of construction spoil and for the disposal of sludge from&#13;
wastewater treatment. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from YP that it&#13;
would carry out, or would cause to be carried out, in a manner satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank/lIDA, the mitigation plans specified in the environmental assessment (EA).&#13;
J. PROJECT REPORTING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.36  The proposed project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 8. Reports on&#13;
project progress based on agreed monitoring indicators would be prepared by each&#13;
implementing agency and consolidated by YEPO, then sent to the Bank/lIDA by the thirtieth&#13;
day of January, April, July and October of each year, commencing in July 1996.&#13;
Assurances to that effect were obtained during negotiations. The last progress report of&#13;
each year would include the latest project cost estimate and financing plan for the&#13;
following year, including  YP' draft budget for local counlerpart funds.   An&#13;
implementation completion report, reviewing the planned objectives and the achievements&#13;
of the project, including costs and benefits derived, and performance and contribution of all&#13;
parties associated with project execution, would be prepared by YP and submitted to the&#13;
Bank/IDA within six months of the Closing Date.&#13;
3.37  To facilitate implementation, a Project Launch Workshop would be held in late&#13;
1996. Project supervision would monitor impact with respect to the objectives (para. 3.5),&#13;
and focus on key sector issues such as utility pricing and environmental regulatory&#13;
effectiveness. Bank Group experience with supervision of the ongoing Urban Infrastructure&#13;
and Environment Project in Liaoning Province, which, like the proposed project, are&#13;
multicity projects, suggests that Bank/IDA supervision would require about 95 staff-weeks&#13;
over the life of the project, of which about 25 staff-weeks would be at headquarters for the&#13;
review of progress and audit reports, procurement actions and correspondence, etc., and 70&#13;
staff-weeks would be in the field. More intensive supervision would be required during the&#13;
first three years of the project, during which time the technical assistance would be made&#13;
operational and many procurement contracts would have been tendered, evaluated and&#13;
awarded. Supervision would be provided by environmental engineering and financial staff,&#13;
as well as other specialists, as needed. The Project Supervision Plan is shown in Annex 10.&#13;
3.38  A mid-term (mid-1999) review would be held to assess critically the progress in&#13;
implementation of the various components of the project. A key issue for the review would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
be the possible reallocation of loan/credit proceeds from underperforming municipalities to&#13;
better performing municipalities, as an incentive for strong municipal performance. The&#13;
mid-term review mission would pay particular attention to utility tariffs, environmental&#13;
regulation, and associated policy issues critical to project and sector success. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that a mid-term review of project progress would&#13;
be undertaken by June 30, 1999, and the agreed recommendations implemented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1   A Leading Group, headed by a Vice Govemor, was set up to guide and give&#13;
policy direction for the preparation, and subsequently, implementation of the proposed&#13;
Yunnan Environment Project (YEP). Members of the Group include representatives from&#13;
the Yunnan Planning Commission, Yunnan Construction Commission, Yunnan Finance&#13;
Bureau, Yunnan Economy and Trade Commission, Yunnan Environmental Protection&#13;
Bureau, Yunnan Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Department, People's&#13;
Construction Bank of China, Yunnan Branch, and cadres from the Kunming Municipal&#13;
Government. The Leading Group designated the Yunnan Environmental Protection&#13;
Bureau (YEPB) as the agency responsible for managing the project. This Bureau&#13;
organized and staffed the Yunnan Environment Project Office (YEPO) to prepare and&#13;
execute the project, including the supervision and monitoring of contracts, maintenance&#13;
of project records, and the submission of progress reports to the Bank (para. 3.36).&#13;
Leading Groups were also set up in each of the project municipalities of Gejiu, Kunming&#13;
and Qujing, under which municipal project offices were established. During project&#13;
preparation, YEPO and the municipal project offices received regular policy guidance&#13;
from their respective leading groups. The municipal project offices in tum created and&#13;
staffed subproject offices in each of the implementing agencies listed in Table 4.1 below.&#13;
4.2   YEPO, which has provided functional guidance to the municipal project offices, has&#13;
interacted well with them and with its consultants and design institutes, expedited resources&#13;
to undertake preparation, and arranged for the project preparation work to be completed to&#13;
the satisfaction of YP and the Bank/IDA. YEPO would have the following responsibilities&#13;
during project implementation:&#13;
(a)   overall project coordination, macro-level project management and&#13;
monitoring;&#13;
(b)   annual budget preparation;&#13;
(c)   project-wide quality assurance;&#13;
(d)   progress reporting to YP and the Bank/IDA, including cost management,&#13;
project impact and environmental improvement assessment;&#13;
(e)   interagency coordination and procurement support; and&#13;
(f)   sectoral training facilitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30-&#13;
4.3     To enable YEPO  to undertake this work effectively, it has been strengthened, and&#13;
the personnel skill mix adjusted to reflect the needs of the implementation and construction&#13;
phase of the project. During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom YP that YEPO&#13;
and the participating municipalities' project offices would be maintained throughout&#13;
implementation with functions and responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank/IDA, with&#13;
competent staff in adequate numbers.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;

4.5     Provincial and Municipal Institutions. YP is headed by a govemor assisted by&#13;
six vice-govemors, who oversee several commissions and/or departments. Various&#13;
provincial commissions, departments and bureaus provide supervision and guidance to&#13;
the municipalities on matters relating to infrastructure, planning, development and&#13;
operation, including environmental protection works. Organization charts of YP and the&#13;
interrelationship of the project implementing agencies with the provincial government are&#13;
given in Annex I11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
4.6   The organization of the municipal governments of Gejiu, Kunming and Qujing is&#13;
similar.  Municipal affairs are overseen by the municipal economic and planning&#13;
commissions, and municipal urban and rural construction commissions.  The latter&#13;
commissions supervise a number of bureaus which are responsible for the physical&#13;
planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure, and for&#13;
environmental protection. In addition, several bureaus concerned with urban infrastructure&#13;
report directly to the office of the mayor. These include the Finance Bureau, the Water&#13;
Conservancy Bureau, the Bureau of Public Health and Public Security Bureau.&#13;
4.7   As part of China's and Yunnan's policy of reforms in the public utilities sector, the&#13;
participating municipalities established self-accounting, and self-funding state-owned&#13;
enterprises to implement the wastewater components of the project (para. 4. 10). The water&#13;
supply components would be implemented by the municipalities' water supply agencies&#13;
established earlier. Prior to negotiations, the Bank/IDA received (a) conformed copies of&#13;
the charters, and (b) business licenses of these enterprises and the Kunming Chemical&#13;
Fertilizer Factory and the Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Factory. Solid waste and nightsoil&#13;
management subcomponents would be implemented, operated and maintained by the&#13;
municipalities' Sanitation Departments/Divisions.&#13;
4.8   Water Supply. The Kunming Water Supply Company (KWSC) was established in&#13;
1915 as a financially autonomous enterprise. It reports to the Kunming Public Utilities&#13;
Bureau. KWSC employs a staff of 866 who are responsible for construction management,&#13;
production, operation and maintenance, consumer service and administration of the&#13;
Kunming water supply system. The Gejiu Water Supply Company and the Qujing Water&#13;
Supply Company were both established in 1994 and report to their respective Construction&#13;
Commissions. Prior to 1994, water supply operations in these cities were provided by the&#13;
water sections of their municipal facilities management divisions (MFMDs), which reported&#13;
to the their respective Urban and Rural Construction Bureaus (URCB) within the municipal&#13;
construction commissions.&#13;
4.9   Wastewater. Until the creation of wastewater entities in Gejiu and Qujing (para.&#13;
4.10), wastewater collection, treatment and disposal were generally provided by the&#13;
sewerage sections of MFMDs, which are also responsible for the operation and&#13;
maintenance of roads, bridges, parks and street lighting. The Kunming Drainage Company&#13;
was formed from four organizations (the tariff, sewerage treatment preparation, sewerage&#13;
treatment management, and drainage preparation departments) of the Kunming Public&#13;
Utilities Bureau. The sewerage sections did not operate on a financially autonomous basis,&#13;
transferring, instead, all tariff revenue collections to the URCB. Funds were consolidated at&#13;
the URCB level and allocated to the various sections for operation, maintenance and capital&#13;
works, on the basis of budgets prepared and submitted by the sections. The wastewater&#13;
entities created for the project will account for their own capital and operating costs, and&#13;
existing wastewater assets have already been transferred to the entities' books. While the&#13;
new entities in Gejiu and Qujing are still required to remit their revenues to their respective&#13;
municipal governments, such funds are earmarked to finance the operation and maintenance&#13;
of the sewerage facilities, and service debt. The remitted revenues, therefore, are returned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
in their entirety to the entities. While less desirable than full autonomy, some water&#13;
companies function efficiently under such a system. The water and wastewater companies&#13;
of Kunming, however, retain their revenues to finance their operations. Staff from the&#13;
existing sewerage sections in the three project cities were transferred to the recently-formed&#13;
wastewater entities and have the skills needed to maintain and operate them, with training&#13;
provided under the project. Small towns and villages' investments in pollution control&#13;
measures in the Dianchi Lake Basin would continue to be provided and maintained by the&#13;
government departments responsible for such services.&#13;
4.10  Kunming Municipality established the Kunming Drainage Company (KDC) in 1994&#13;
as a self-accounting, self-funding state-owned enterprise to implement its wastewater&#13;
component. It officially started operations in May 1995. KDC reports to the Kunming&#13;
Public Utilities Bureau. It has a sanctioned staff strength of 502, of which about 392 are&#13;
currently on the payroll, responsible for construction management, collection, treatment and&#13;
disposal of wastewater and stormwater, operation and maintenance, consumer service and&#13;
administration. In June 1995, Gejiu established a self-accounting, self-funding wastewater&#13;
unit within the Gejiu Water Supply Company which then became the Gejiu Water Supply&#13;
and Drainage Company (GWSDC). The present total staff strength of the company is about&#13;
160, with 100 assigned to water supply, 40 to wastewater, and 20 to joint administration.&#13;
They are responsible for water, wastewater and drainage construction management, water&#13;
supply production and distribution, wastewater and stormwater collection, treatment and&#13;
disposal, operation and maintenance, consumer service and administration. In January&#13;
1996, Qujing Municipality established a similar wastewater unit within the Qujing Water&#13;
Supply Company, the new company-The Qujing Water Supply and Drainage Company&#13;
(QWSDC)-having similar responsibilities to those of GWSDC. The sanctioned staff&#13;
strength of the company is about 177, of which about 157 are currently on the payroll.&#13;
4.11  Solid Waste and Nightsoil Management. Domestic, municipal and nightsoil&#13;
collection and disposal are the responsibility of municipal appearance/maintenance&#13;
(sanitation) departments. Domestic waste and nightsoil collections are usually performed&#13;
by subdistrict street teams who collect the waste from the residential units and transfer it,&#13;
usually by handcart, to transfer stations around the cities. From there it is collected by the&#13;
sanitation departments and disposed of at landfills or dumping grounds, or, in the case of&#13;
nightsoil, to storage tanks, into the sewerage system, or to farmers. Neighborhood&#13;
committees collect fees to offset collection costs. Other domestic costs are covered by a flat&#13;
tax per employee and through general government revenues.  Industrial (including&#13;
hazardous/toxic) and commercial wastes are disposed of by the enterprises themselves, or&#13;
by the sanitation departments, against payment of fees or service charges. Infectious&#13;
hospital waste is normally incinerated by the hospitals themselves; the domestic hospital&#13;
waste is disposed of in the same manner as other domestic waste. Recycling is practiced&#13;
widely in all the project cities. The recyclable substances are mainly ferrous and nonferrous&#13;
metals, rubber, plastic, glass, paper and textiles; these are usually brought to municipal-run&#13;
collection points by the waste producers themselves, and by informal sector operators. The&#13;
latter collect material from producers, from collection points, transfer stations or the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
disposal sites. Some of the recyclable materials collected by the informal sector are sold&#13;
directly to enterprises.&#13;
4.12  Industrial Pollution Control. The Industrial Pollution Control (IPC) component&#13;
relies on a three part strategy: (a) direct onlending to clean up two fertilizer plants (the&#13;
Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Factory and the Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Factory) that&#13;
are major polluters; (b) lending for a number of smaller pollution control investments&#13;
through an Environmental Pollution Control Subloans (EPCSL) Facility, with initial capital&#13;
equivalent of Y 84 million (about $10 million), comprising equal amounts of Bank/IDA and&#13;
local funds; and (c) instituting time-bound environmental management improvement action&#13;
plans for pollution reduction measures at the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant and the Yunfeng&#13;
Paper Mill, financed through non-Bank sources, as well as ceasing operations in the&#13;
manufacture and handling of pesticides and other toxic materials at the Kunming Pesticide&#13;
Plant by not later than June 30, 1999, to protect municipal wastewater treatment facilities.&#13;
The IPC component, including the adverse impact the above enterprises have on the&#13;
environment, is described in detail in Annex 12. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtainedfrom YP that it would carry out, or cause to be carried out, time-bound action&#13;
plans for environmental management improvements at Kunming Iron and Steel Plant and&#13;
at Yunfeng Paper Mill. Assurances were also obtained from YP that it would cause the&#13;
Kunming Pesticide Plant to implement a time-bound environmental management action&#13;
plan.&#13;
4.13  Environmental Pollution Control Subloans. Environmental Pollution Control&#13;
Subloans (EPCSL) will be operated by YFB as a government facility, although with&#13;
segregated accounting and special operating procedures. The management and operation of&#13;
EPCSL are summarized in Annex 12. The purpose of EPCSL will be to provide funds for&#13;
environrnental pollution control, targeted to small-scale industries.  Project selection,&#13;
appraisal, both technical and financial, and environmental and resettlement criteria have&#13;
been proposed and generally follow those of similar funds in operation elsewhere in China.&#13;
Projects will be selected according to cost effectiveness and financial viability, with the first&#13;
three appraisals and all appraisals for proposed subloans of over $300,000 receiving ex-ante&#13;
review by the Bank/IDA and the remainder subject to ex-post review. The principal&#13;
funding sources for EPCSL will be funds allocated by YP (para. 3.14), and the proceeds of&#13;
the Loan/Credit and recycling of loan and interest payments.&#13;
4.14  Institutional Development and Training. As the above-mentioned wastewater&#13;
entities have been created only recently and the solid waste bureaus lack financial&#13;
management tools, the project's institutional development and training component has been&#13;
designed specifically to address the accounting, management information, financial&#13;
management, utility pricing, technical requirements and training needs of the implementing&#13;
entities.&#13;

C. STATUS OF ENGINEERING&#13;
4.15 Project preparation and design work has been undertaken jointly by international&#13;
and local consultants and design bureaus, and is well advanced. Final design and the&#13;
preparation of draft tender documents for the following contracts representing&#13;
approximately 20 percent of the municipal services investments was completed prior to&#13;
appraisal. The remaining final design and bidding documents preparation will continue&#13;
during the period prior to effectiveness.&#13;

5. FINANCE&#13;
A. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.1   Since 1978, Chinese economic reforms have evolved gradually toward an&#13;
increasingly decentralized financial system in China. Most industrial production and&#13;
prices have become free of government control, and enterprises have to purchase most of&#13;
their inputs at market prices. Enterprise reform has become a high priority of the&#13;
Government. In this connection, the guiding principles of the recently promulgated&#13;
"regulations on transforming the management mechanisms of state-owned industrial&#13;
enterprises" are to separate government administration from enterprise management,&#13;
increase the autonomy and accountability of state-owned enterprises, and increase&#13;
competition and market-orientation. The reform efforts to improve economic policies&#13;
and enterprise efficiencies are essential for sustaining both economic development and&#13;
environmental protection in the longer run.&#13;
5.2   In order for the enterprises to assume their increased responsibilities efficiently and&#13;
effectively, the strengthening of their financial management is essential. Toward this end,&#13;
the proposed project would support the applications of modern management techniques and&#13;
human resource development for the utility companies.&#13;
B. ACCOUNTING&#13;
5.3   Different accounting systems are used by enterprises (autonomous units),&#13;
construction units (which execute investment projects) and local government departments,&#13;
in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
5.4   Enterprise Accounting. All the state-owned enterprises in China follow a unified&#13;
enterprise accounting system. The accounting framework was developed in the context of a&#13;
highly centralized planned economy. With a view to complementing the ongoing efforts to&#13;
deepen reforms in the financial sector and enterprise management, the accounting system in&#13;
China needed modernization to permit satisfactory financial management in an increasingly&#13;
decentralized and market-oriented environment. As a first step, the general principles of&#13;
enterprise (the term to include public utilities such as water, sewerage, and district heating&#13;
companies) accounting were revised by the Ministry of Finance from July 1, 1993 to be&#13;
more consistent with internationally generally accepted accounting practice. As part of the&#13;
reforms, enterprises are required to produce five reports for submission to Government:&#13;
balance sheet, income statement, source and application of funds, profit distribution, and&#13;
details of main business. The first two reports are required monthly, the remainder on an&#13;
annual basis. All enterprise implementing agencies included in the project will be&#13;
following the new accounting and reporting formats.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
5.5   Government Accounting. The regular government department accounts reflect&#13;
expenditures incurred against budget allocations by YP or its municipal governments.&#13;
Accounting is handled in a decentralized manner through transfers to subunits from which&#13;
actual expenditures are made and recorded on a cash basis. Accounts are kept at all levels,&#13;
and each subunit reflects in its accounts the budget allocation it receives from the unit&#13;
above.&#13;
5.6   Project Accounts.  Project accounts would be maintained by YEPO, the&#13;
environmental sanitation departments of Kunming and Qujing, and for small towns and&#13;
rural sanitation component in accordance with the State Construction Unit Accounting&#13;
System. This system prescribes generally accepted accounting practices, including double-&#13;
entry bookkeeping, subsidiary ledger accounting, and rules for capitalizing and expending&#13;
various items of expenditure. It also sets out detailed accounting definitions for capital&#13;
works, cash control, receivables and payables. In addition, it identifies a number of basic&#13;
monthly, quarterly and annual reporting formats, including funds flow statements and&#13;
balance sheets. The construction accounting system is comprehensive, and is adequate for&#13;
the proposed project. Project-related expenditures incurred by enterprises (e.g., the water&#13;
and wastewater entities and the industries to be included in the industrial pollution control&#13;
component), would be reflected within their respective enterprise accounting systems.&#13;
C. AUDITS&#13;
5.7   As with other Bank/IDA-financed projects in China, the Foreign Investrnent Audit&#13;
Bureau of the State Audit Administration (SAA), established in 1983, would have overall&#13;
responsibility for auditing accounts concerning the project. The actual auditing work will&#13;
be conducted by the Yunnan Provincial Audit Department under SAA's supervision. This&#13;
arrangement is satisfactory. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the&#13;
following annual audits would be submitted to the Bank/IDA within six months after the end&#13;
of the financial year. (a) audit of (i) the project accounts maintained by YEPO, (ii) the&#13;
environmental sanitation departments of Kunming and Qujing, and (iii) the bureaus&#13;
responsible for the Jinning and Chenggong components, (b) audit of the Special Account;&#13;
(c) audit of Statements of Expenditure (SOE); and (d) audits of the financial statements of&#13;
(i) KWSC, (ii) KDC, (iii) QWSDC, (iv) GWSDC, and (v) EPCSL. Understandings were&#13;
obtained during negotiations that audit reports would include opinions on whether&#13;
implementing agencies were in compliance with their respective financial covenants, and&#13;
whether these agencies had taken out adequate insurance on goods and works financed&#13;
from loan/credit proceeds. The Bank/IDA would expect to receive the first such audit&#13;
reports by June 30, 1998, covering project implementation activities commencing in fiscal&#13;
year 1997.&#13;
D. PROVINCIAL FINANCE&#13;
5.8   The Yunnan Provincial Government has two types of finance, on-budgetary and off-&#13;
budgetary. On-budgetary revenues are provided through taxes, the base and rate of which&#13;
are set by the Central Government. The Central Government directly controls the single&#13;
largest tax source-the value-added tax-receipts from which are shared with local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37-&#13;
government. A variety of other taxes are collected and used directly by local government.&#13;
Most off-budgetary revenues consist of special fees paid by enterprises, and fees and&#13;
charges relating to construction activities. These are used for capital expenditures. On-&#13;
budgetary and off-budgetary accounts are not consolidated. While information on off-&#13;
budgetary revenues and expenditures is confidential, and was not, therefore, provided to the&#13;
Bank/IDA, they are said to be at least as large as the on-budgetary data.&#13;
5.9   YP will recover the debt associated with the project as it is being passed on to the&#13;
municipalities and industrial enterprises. YP will monitor municipal finances to assure that&#13;
the municipalities and their respective agencies meet their debt service obligations. Should&#13;
the municipalities and their subborrowers be unable to fulfill their obligations, YP would&#13;
have no difficulty in covering debt service through its own resources, as the debt service&#13;
represented by the project is small compared to total provincial budgetary expenditures.&#13;
Provincial fiscal budgetary revenues and expenditures totaled about Y 23.8 billion ($2.8&#13;
billion) and Y 22.9 billion ($2.7 billion), respectively, in 1994. Between 1992 and 1994,&#13;
revenues and expenditures increased on average by about 65 and 63 percent a year in&#13;
current terms, respectively. Revenues are derived mainly from taxes on industry and&#13;
commerce, which have been remitted by the municipalities. Revenues and expenditures are&#13;
projected to grow between 7 and 10 percent a year in real terms during the project period.&#13;
Projected receipts and expenditures for Yunnan Province and the participating prefectures,&#13;
municipalities and counties are provided in the report on Provincial, Prefectural, Municipal&#13;
and County Financial Projections for Fiscal Year 1992 to 2005 (on-budget), which is&#13;
included in the Project File (AnnexJ16).&#13;
E. PREFECTURAL FINANCE&#13;
5.10  There are 17 prefectures in Yunnan Province. They form an intermediate layer of&#13;
government between the provincial and municipal administrations, except in the case of&#13;
Kunming which reports directly to YP. The municipalities of Gejiu and Qujing report&#13;
through Honghe and Qujing Prefectures, respectively.&#13;
5.11  Prefectures have similar sources of receipts and expenditures as the provincial and&#13;
municipal levels of government. In 1994, the receipts and expenditures of Honghe and&#13;
Qujing Prefectures totaled about Y 1.1 and Y 1.3 billion each, respectively. Each Prefecture&#13;
will contribute about 25 percent of the counterpart funding requirements of the proposed&#13;
project investments of Gejiu and Qujing. Each would be liable for repayment of the&#13;
proceeds of the Loan/Credit onlent to the municipalities in the event the latter defaulted on&#13;
their obligations.&#13;
F. MUNICIPAL FINANCE&#13;
5.12 YP will, through the municipalities of Gejiu, Kunming and Qujing, provide all&#13;
funding not met by (a) the proceeds of the Bank Loan and IDA Credit, (b) prefectural&#13;
contributions, (c) municipal contributions, and (d) funds generated internally by the&#13;
implementing agencies. During project implementation, the financial projections show that&#13;
these requirements would be of the order of Y 80 million for Gejiu, Y 1,130 million for&#13;
Kunming, and Y 335 million for Qujing. The municipalities, like YP, have two sources of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
finance, on-budgetary and off-budgetary. The off-budget details are confidential, and were&#13;
not, therefore, provided to the Bank/IDA. The municipal funding requirements would come&#13;
from many more sources than municipal on-budget revenue. The Yunnan Finance Bureau&#13;
(YFB) has independently assessed the municipalities' ability to generate the required&#13;
counterpart funds from assured sources.&#13;
5.13  Summarized historical and projected on-budget revenue and expenditure statements&#13;
of the municipalities of Gejiu, Kunming and Qujing for the period 1994-2002 are given in&#13;
Annex 13, together with assumptions to the projections. Average annual project-related&#13;
expenditures comprise between about 3 to 46 percent of the municipalities' annual total on-&#13;
budget expenditures.&#13;
G. PUBLIC UTILITIES&#13;
5.14 The salient features of the future finances of (a) Kunming Water Supply Company&#13;
(KWSC), (b) Qujing Municipal Water Supply unit, (c) Gejiu Municipal Drainage unit,&#13;
(d) Kunming Drainage Company (KDC), and (e) Qujing Municipal Wastewater unit, based&#13;
on the indices and exchange rates mentioned in paras. 3.9, are highlighted in Tables 5.2 and&#13;
5.3. The assumptions used in the financial projections, and detailed operational and&#13;
financial monitoring indicators are included in Annex 14.  The projected financial&#13;
statements are provided in the Report on Water and Wastewater Companies' Operational&#13;
and Financial Projections 1993-2002 which is included in the Project File (Annex 16).&#13;
Prior to appraisal, Gejiu and Qujing implemented revised wastewater tariffs, and Kunming&#13;
and Qujing implemented revised water supply tariffs. Implementation of a wastewater&#13;
tariff of no less than Y 0. 35/m3 by KDC is a condition of effectiveness of the loan/credit. It&#13;
will be a condition of disbursement of the Lake Dianchi Basin Water Quality Recovery&#13;
component that the BanklIDA receive (a) afinancialforecast relating to KDC's operations&#13;
for fiscal year 1997, acceptable to the Bank/IDA, showing that KDC will meet the same&#13;
financial performance targets required of it for fiscal year 1998 (para. 5.21), except that its&#13;
operating revenues in fiscal year 1997 can be defined as revenues from operational and&#13;
nonoperational sources; and (b) written confirmation that all wastewater tariff increases&#13;
included in the forecast referred to above have been approved by YP. The previous and&#13;
revised (where applicable) tariffs are set out in Table 5.1 below.&#13;

5.15 Kunming Water Supply Company. KWSC posted modest losses between 1993&#13;
and 1995, principally because it had not been permitted to adjust its tariffs since February&#13;
1993. As a condition of appraisal, enhanced tariffs went into effect on January 1, 1996.&#13;
The financial objectives set for KWSC  by YP and Kunming Municipal Government&#13;
(KMG) are for it to make reasonable contributions to its capital investment program, after&#13;
meeting its cash expenses. Projections made up to the year 2002 show that KWSC would&#13;
post surpluses if it is permitted to maintain the relatively high tariff recently put in place as a&#13;
condition of appraisal.&#13;
5.16   Qujing Water Supply Unit. Prior to the establishment of the Qujing Water Supply&#13;
Company in 1995, the departmental water supply operation had managed to generate&#13;
sufficient revenues to cover approximately the operations and maintenance costs. However,&#13;
as is the practice in departnental operations, no provision for depreciation was made. Had&#13;
depreciation been included, the operation would have run at a loss. As a condition of&#13;
appraisal, Qujing revised its water tariffs, increasing them by an average of 43 percent.&#13;

5.17  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that, commencing in fiscal year&#13;
1997, YP would cause KWSC to (a) generate revenues from its water supply operations&#13;
sufficient to cover its operating and maintenance costs (before depreciation), increases in&#13;
working capital, debt service, and 20 percent of the average capital expenditures made in a&#13;
three-year period (the year preceding the reference year, the reference year itself, and the&#13;
year after the reference year); and (b) incur no additional debt without the Bank Group's&#13;
agreement, unless a reasonable forecast shows that it would have a debt service coverage&#13;
of at least 1.3 times.&#13;
5.18 Assurances were obtained during negotiations that, commencing with Fiscal Year&#13;
1997, YP would cause QWSDC to (a) produce revenues from its water supply operations&#13;
sufficient to cover its operations and maintenance costs (including depreciation), and the&#13;
amount by which debt service requirements exceed the provision for depreciation; and&#13;
(b) incur no additional debt without the Bank Group's agreement, unless a reasonable&#13;
forecast shows that it would have a debt service coverage of at least 1.3 times.&#13;
Wastewater Agencies&#13;
5.19  As the wastewater agencies, which evolved out of the cities' departmental&#13;
wastewater operations, were established only in the latter phases of the project preparation&#13;
cycle, no assessment of their past performance was possible. Based on the limited data&#13;
available, it was determined that departmental wastewater operations were not able to meet&#13;
their operating expenses, excluding depreciation, in 1994.  As is the practice in&#13;
departmental operations, no provision for depreciation was made. Had depreciation charges&#13;
been included, their operations would have run at a greater loss. As no departmental&#13;
revenue data was made available, the financial projections were developed from the net&#13;
historical value of investments made in the wastewater sector. The financial objective set&#13;
by YP for the newly-established wastewater entities is to achieve full cost recovery, and, if&#13;
possible, generate some funds for future capital investment.&#13;
5.20 Prior to appraisal, the Bank/IDA received written confirnation from YP of the&#13;
implementation of enhanced wastewater tariffs in Gejiu and Qujing; the former with effect&#13;
from August 1995, and the latter, from February 1996. The salient features of the future&#13;
finances of (a) the drainage units of (i) Gejiu Water Supply and Drainage Company; and&#13;
(ii) Qujing Water Supply and Drainage Company; and (b) Kunming Drainage Company are&#13;
highlighted in Table 5.3 below. The assumptions used in the financial projections and&#13;
detailed operational and financial monitoring indicators are included in Annex 14.&#13;
5.21  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that YP would cause the wastewater&#13;
entities of GWSDC, QWSDC, and KDC, commencing with fiscal year 1997 in the case of&#13;
GWSDC and QWSDC, and fiscal year 1998 in the case of KDC, to (a) produce revenues&#13;
from their wastewater operations sufficient to cover their operations and maintenance costs&#13;
(including depreciation), and the amount by which debt service requirements exceed the&#13;
provision for depreciation; and (b) incur no additional debt without the Bank Group's&#13;
agreement, unless a reasonable forecast shows that the entities would have a debt service&#13;
&#13;

coverage of at least 1.3 times. An understanding was obtained during negotiations that YP&#13;
would arrange for the municipalities of Gejiu, Kunming and Qujing to transfer to their&#13;
respective wastewater companies, quarterly, one quarter of the wastewater companies'&#13;
annual estimates of their stormwater operations and maintenance costs..&#13;

following fiscal years, forecasts satisfactory to the Bank/lIDA, (a) to review whether they&#13;
would meet the covenanted requirements set forth above in such year and the following&#13;
fiscal year; and (b) to furnish the results of such reviews to the Bank/IDA. If any such&#13;
review would show that a water and wastewater entity would not meet the requirements set&#13;
out above, the entity would take all necessary measures, including adjustments to the&#13;
structure of its tariffs and charges, in order to meet the requirements.&#13;

H. SOLID WASTE AND NIGHTSOIL MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.23  These services are municipal environmental services that have traditionally been&#13;
funded from the general revenues of local governments. However, where individual users&#13;
of the services have been identified, local governments have, as a policy matter, charged&#13;
such users for the services provided. In Kunming and Qujing, only large industries are&#13;
currently paying charges for solid waste disposal. Tariff rates are not published and&#13;
charging appears to be based on negotiation. As a result, only a small part of the costs of&#13;
providing the service is covered.&#13;
5.24  Kunming and Qujing have considered increasing their fees and charges, and have&#13;
already approved higher charges for some parts of the services. The cost recovery&#13;
objectives for solid waste and nightsoil services for Kunming and Qujing are to recover the&#13;
full unit cost of collection and disposal where user identification and billing is economically&#13;
feasible. The balance of the cost for providing these services would be met from the&#13;
general revenues of the municipality.&#13;
5.25   During the implementation phase of this component the cities have indicated that&#13;
they anticipate charging fees toward meeting their operating costs. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained from YP that it would ensure that Kunming and Qujing&#13;
Municipalities would each: (a) not later than July 1, 1997, complete a study of the fees and&#13;
user charges needed for the recovery of the full costs of providing solid waste collection&#13;
and disposal services to industrial and commercial users; the report of that study shall&#13;
include a detailed, time-bound action plan, acceptable to the BanklIDA, enabling such&#13;
recovery as of January 1, 1998; and (b) thereafter implement said action plan taking into&#13;
account the BanklIDA 's comments thereon.&#13;
5.26  As these services have been decentralized to the district and subdistrict levels, and&#13;
because the accounting systems, particularly at the lower levels, are weak, accurate costs of&#13;
providing these services have been difficult to determine. The project, therefore, includes&#13;
technical assistance and training to help develop appropriate accounting, including unit cost&#13;
accounting, and management information systems for determining accurate unit costs of the&#13;
services at the various stages, e.g., collection, transportation, treatment (in the case of&#13;
nightsoil), and final disposal. With such information, the cities would then be in a better&#13;
position to (a) assess the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the services; (b) price their&#13;
services to recover the full economic cost where user identification and billing is&#13;
economically feasible; and (c) judge whether the services, or parts thereof, can be further&#13;
commercialized or privatized.&#13;
1. INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION CONTROL&#13;
5.27  As some of the priority pollution control subprojects are, by nature, not financially&#13;
productive, the financial appraisal would focus on the long-term financial health of the&#13;
enterprises. The key considerations in this assessment include the enterprise's development&#13;
goals and strategy, product mix and market analysis, investment requirements and related&#13;
financing arrangements, and projected financial performance in terms of profitability,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
liquidity and debt servicing capabilities. The two subprojects (Kunming Chemical&#13;
Fertilizer Factory and Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Factory) that Bank/IDA staff have&#13;
already appraised meet the above financial criteria and therefore are considered financially&#13;
viable. With a view to promoting prudent financial management, the agreed subproject&#13;
selection criteria call for the entity to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of not less than&#13;
1.4 times after the proposed subproject has reached full production capacity.&#13;
&#13;

6. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
A. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
6.1   As described in Chapter 2, the project derives from the CAS in its support of&#13;
provincial efforts to substantially reduce pollution within the province, especially within&#13;
densely populated urban areas, by improving environmental regulation and providing new&#13;
models for the efficient organization and financing of urban environmental services.&#13;
Specifically, the project would support:&#13;
(a)   the more aggressive use of user fees to shift the burden of pollution&#13;
abatement to the polluter and induce waste minimization, and new&#13;
organizational forms for wastewater providers, to allow improved&#13;
management tools and to help minimize the cost of abatement;&#13;
(b)   expansion of sewerage services, hence a reduction in water pollution, within&#13;
the boundaries of Gejiu, Kunming, and Qujing, thus protecting the urban&#13;
environment and the health of their people;&#13;
(c)   increases in water supply in the cities of Kunming and Qujing, to meet the&#13;
needs of growing urban populations;&#13;
(d)   the first municipal solid waste landfills meeting national standards in the&#13;
cities of Kunming and Qujing, with consequent protection of local land and&#13;
water resources and flaring landfill methane to reduce greenhouse gas&#13;
emissions;&#13;
(e)   abatement of two important industrial point sources of pollution affecting&#13;
Lake Dianchi in Kunming and a pollution control revolving fund to address&#13;
less costly pollution abatement efforts and provide a model for other such&#13;
funds; and&#13;
(f)   the provincial and municipal EPBs in their efforts to implement more&#13;
effective regulatory instruments.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
6.2        During project identification, it became clear that Yunnan and its cities needed&#13;
substantial changes in policy and institutional structures along the lines described in the&#13;
report China: Urban Environmental Service Management. Policy problems included urban&#13;
environmental services priced too low to discourage waste generation or provide the&#13;
financing needed to build, maintain, and operate services such as water supply and&#13;
wastewater collection and treatment. Government bureaus providing the services lacked the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
financial tools to develop effective tariff strategies or the operating autonomy needed to&#13;
encourage managerial innovation. Gaps in environmental regulation were also apparent.&#13;
Therefore, investment choices were made with a view toward maximizing the impact of&#13;
policy and institutional innovation within the province. Specific investment choices within&#13;
sectors and cities responded to long-run municipal government strategies to bring ambient&#13;
environmental quality or service standards up to national guidelines. In the case of&#13;
augmented water supply in Kunming and Qujing, and the avoided damage to Kunming's&#13;
water supply, explicit benefit analysis was possible and undertaken. For the wastewater&#13;
investments in Qujing and Gejiu and the solid waste handling and treatment investments in&#13;
Kunming and Qujing, least-cost analysis to meet specified standards was used. Based on&#13;
that analysis, city leaders made decisions on their short-run goals and investments.&#13;
6.3    City and Sector Choices. In urban environmental service provision, cities were&#13;
included in the project based on the size of the population potentially benefiting from&#13;
improved services and considering their value as models to other provincial cities. Yunnan&#13;
has one very large city, Kunming, with an urban population of some 1.2 million, and 10&#13;
smaller cities, the largest of which has about 180,000 people. After reviewing potential&#13;
investments in some five provincial cities, three were selected for further project&#13;
development. Kunming was given the top ranking because of its size and the major water&#13;
quality and supply problem it faces. The other two cities are of a size and economic&#13;
strength akin to most Yunnan cities and their experience under the project will therefore be&#13;
more readily transferred. Each of the selected cities had already prepared environmental&#13;
improvement plans that outlined priority service needs, both in terms of the type of service&#13;
and areas of the city needing service. Work with Bank Group missions confirmed the&#13;
choice to extend sewerage systems and provide treatment and to build or substantially&#13;
expand sanitary landfills as the next step in environmental protection. Additional water&#13;
supply needs had also to be met if their growing urban populations were to have access to&#13;
safe water.&#13;
6.4   Credit market constraints [described much more fully in the China Department's&#13;
1995 Capital Markets Sector Study (No. 14501-CHA)] leave unexploited abatement&#13;
opportunities in economically and financial viable enterprises that currently have a high&#13;
pollution impact. Yunnan Province therefore sought to use part of the loan to fund such&#13;
investments. The Province agreed with the Bank Group on a selection process to identify&#13;
the highest-impact polluters, a process that has identified two chemical fertilizer plants for&#13;
process change investments that will increase profitability as they abate pollution. These&#13;
plants both discharge high levels of pollutants to Lake Dianchi, and their cleanup is far less&#13;
costly than providing municipal treatment services removing the same mass of pollutants.&#13;
To provide for such opportunities in smaller enterprises, the Province also established a&#13;
pollution control loan fund, initially capitalized at $10 million, for which it requested Bank&#13;
Group support.&#13;
6.5   Ideally, sector interventions would have been chosen based on the comparison of&#13;
intersectoral costs and benefits. Unfortunately, current methodologies do not permit high-&#13;
confidence benefit estimates for the proposed wastewater investments in Qujing and Gejiu,&#13;
nor the solid waste collection and treatment in any of the cities. In Kunming, the fact that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
all wastewater discharges into Lake Dianchi, which also serves as a primary water source&#13;
for the city, does permit a benefit estimate at a reasonably high degree of confidence. In&#13;
that case, the cost of doing nothing different from current practice will have an impact on&#13;
lake water quality that forces increased treatment costs and an early shift to new, and more&#13;
expensive, water sources. Those costs serve as a proxy for part of the pollution damage and&#13;
averting them more than justifies the proposed investments. No attempt was made to value&#13;
the aesthetic or health impacts that might be additional to the increased water supply costs.&#13;
6.6    Organizational and Financing Alternatives. Of the proposed investments, the&#13;
solid waste will be managed by municipal environmental sanitation departments; the water&#13;
by an existing municipally-owned enterprise; the wastewater by newly formed municipally-&#13;
owned enterprises; and the fertilizer plant pollution abatement by the enterprises&#13;
themselves. In each case, the enterprises or activities were judged unable to effectively&#13;
compete for private financing at this stage in their development, though institutional&#13;
reforms under the project will help them attain that goal in the future. None have a history&#13;
of sufficiently profitable operation to attract private financing. In the case of the water and&#13;
fertilizer enterprises, the lack of profits can be attributed to the fact that they continue to fall&#13;
under a tightly controlled output price regime, while facing a largely deregulated input&#13;
market. For water, the project commits the municipalities to regulating prices such as to&#13;
allow a positive return. The fertilizer enterprises will shift production to unregulated&#13;
markets, thus partially escaping the regulatory burden. The wastewater enterprises were&#13;
created to provide a managerial structure facilitating efficient operation, something absent&#13;
in their previous government bureau form. For wastewater, the municipalities have&#13;
committed to a price structure that results in break-even operations. Only solid waste&#13;
remains a government bureau operation. Here, the current collection operation works&#13;
sufficiently well that emphasis was placed on providing technical assistance to properly cost&#13;
the operation and allow adequate rates for commercial, industrial, and other system users.&#13;
In all cases, a project goal is to help create the preconditions for greater nongovernmental&#13;
involvement in service provision.&#13;
6.7    Wastewater.  The economic analysis of wastewater collection and treatment&#13;
programs generally presents challenging analytical problems on the benefit side. The range&#13;
of impacts, on amenity, health, and commodity production uses, can be described but&#13;
usually not easily quantified. However, in this project Kunming's Dianchi Lake water use&#13;
for municipal supply creates a condition whereby pollution damage can be modeled and&#13;
impacts quantified with a reasonable degree of confidence. That analysis was undertaken.&#13;
In the case of Qujing and Gejiu, the least-cost analysis was linked to alternative water&#13;
quality outcomes. Although municipal leaders originally set a goal of reaching Class IV&#13;
surface water, the results of the least-cost analysis persuaded them to value the alternative&#13;
goal of Class V. Details are discussed in Annex 15, with a brief summary given below.&#13;
(a)    Kunming. Because Dianchi Lake supplies half of Kunming's water, and&#13;
because Kunming's pollution is causing lake water quality to deteriorate in a&#13;
well-understood way, it is possible to value the damage from the pollution in&#13;
terms of the increased cost of treated water supply from the lake, or the cost&#13;
of going to new sources outside the lake.  The proposed wastewater&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
treatment interventions under the project would treat part of the waste&#13;
stream, reducing total pollution inflow. That impact can again be modeled&#13;
and the net effect on Dianchi water quality, hence pollution damage,&#13;
determined. Other impacts, including those on recreational, health and&#13;
amenity values, also exist, but estimates of those values have a lower degree&#13;
of confidence and have not been included in the analysis.&#13;
The Dianchi lake water quality model identified phosphorus loads as&#13;
limiting for this important raw water source. The economic analysis&#13;
therefore concentrated on investments that would control that pollutant, and&#13;
compared damage in a "do nothing" scenario of operating existing&#13;
infrastructure and that currently under construction, under current practices,&#13;
to damage with the reduced loads under the project. In the "do nothing"&#13;
scenario, pollutant loads grow rapidly (see Annex 7, Figure 1), forcing first&#13;
higher treatment costs for potable water, then, by 2002, investment in major&#13;
new sources of supply. The project would allow sustained use of Lake&#13;
Dianchi as the primary water source over the 25 year analytical horizon.&#13;
The analysis of the water supply impact shows that the proposed wastewater&#13;
investment would avert damage with a net present value of Y 2,761 million,&#13;
at a net present value cost of Y 1,719 million, assuming a 12 percent&#13;
discount rate. This result is most sensitive to the need for investment in new&#13;
sources of supply. If that need were delayed five years, and costs dropped&#13;
10 percent, the averted damage would fall to Y 2,066 million, still well&#13;
above the sub-component cost net present value. However, measured&#13;
deterioration has been so rapid that even a five-year delay is highly unlikely,&#13;
and were it to occur, project costs themselves would drop, as advanced water&#13;
treatment could also be delayed.&#13;
(b)   Qujing. Qujing wastewater discharges to the Nanpanjiang River, thence&#13;
downstream to the Pearl River. Wastewater pollution of the Nanpanjiang&#13;
has already forced some downstream farmers to abandon this source of&#13;
irrigation and drinking water and shift to more expensive groundwater&#13;
pumping. Continued failure by Qujing to capture and treat wastewater will&#13;
result in ever more rural communities losing their primary source of water.&#13;
Qujing authorities therefore requested their design institutes to perform a&#13;
least-cost analysis of treatment options that would maintain the Nanpanjiang&#13;
at Class IV water quality, suitable for agricultural and industrial use. The&#13;
treatment options considered include oxidation ponds, and three variants of&#13;
activated sludge processes. The authorities judged this cost too high,&#13;
requesting a separate analysis on treatment to reach Class V, suitable for&#13;
irrigation but few other uses. Here an intermediate stage activated sludge&#13;
process was selected that can readily be incorporated in the longer term&#13;
proposals.&#13;
(c)   Gejiu. Gejiu wastewater discharges to Gejiu Lake, from which it serves as&#13;
an irrigation water source, despite the below Class V quality of the water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
As in Qujing, the authorities initially sought treatment that would restore the&#13;
lake to Class IV. Again, three treatment processes were considered, with&#13;
two-stage activated sludge again least-cost. However, as with Qujing, this&#13;
was deemed unaffordable and an intermediate stage biological system&#13;
capable of incorporation into longer term proposals was again chosen.&#13;
Despite the lower treatment level, Gejiu Lake water quality will be raised by&#13;
discharging the treated Gejiu effluent downstream of the lake.&#13;
6.8   Water Supply.  Under the project, the water supply for Kunming will be&#13;
augmented by some 65 m3/year, supplying an estimated 500,000 new connections as&#13;
coverage increases and urban growth continues. The average economic incremental cost&#13;
of the new supply has been estimated at Y 0.60/m3. Two willingness-to-pay surveys,&#13;
conducted at different times with different methodologies, showed 89 percent of&#13;
households willing to pay at least Y 0.71/mr3 for potable water supply in one case and 72&#13;
percent willing to pay at least Y 0.60/mn3 in the other. The average tariff was raised from&#13;
January 1, 1996, to above Y 0.60/m3 with no noticeable reduction of demand. The true&#13;
test of consumer response to the new tariff will come in the summer, high demand,&#13;
season. However, all the evidence supports the conclusion of a positive net present value&#13;
(NPV) for this investment. More precise quantification would need evidence on the&#13;
shape of the demand curve at prices above Y 0.60/m3, and that does not exist.&#13;
6.9    Solid Waste. Solid waste landfill options are also discussed in detail in Annex 15.&#13;
Here, initial choices for both Kunming and Qujing were among potential solid waste&#13;
disposal strategies that included recycling, composting, incineration, and landfilling.&#13;
Recycling plays an active role in each of the cities, capturing more than 5 percent of the&#13;
municipal waste stream that can be profitably recycled. The industry is highly competitive,&#13;
with a combination of state-owned and private firms providing services, and little scope for&#13;
additional useful municipal intervention. Composting, to recycle organic materials, has&#13;
been tested in Kunming. Costs have been high and markets have not supported product&#13;
sales. A major problem for composting and incineration is that over half of the waste&#13;
stream is inorganic, with coal ash the dominant inorganic component. Analysis in other&#13;
cities with similar waste streams has shown incineration to be substantially more costly than&#13;
landfill. Based on that work, the two cities have elected to use landfilling to handle their&#13;
municipal solid wastes.&#13;
6.10  The cities have accepted that such landfills must comply with national standards, so&#13;
made no attempt to compare the cost of adding leachate and gas collection with the damage&#13;
that would ensue from their absence. Given the long-run risks inherent in unprotected&#13;
landfills, the Bank/IDA accepted without additional impact evaluation the municipal&#13;
judgment on the need to provide leachate and gas collection and treatment. The least-cost&#13;
site and design had, as one of the main decision criteria, minimization of the joint cost of&#13;
transport and land acquisition. As land acquisition cost correlates very strongly with&#13;
resettlement impact, this criteria also tends to minimize resettlement.&#13;
6.11  Industrial Pollution ControL The industrial pollution control component has two&#13;
subcomponents, the first being direct investment in two chemical fertilizer plants producing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
a very high proportion of the phosphorus loads in Dianchi and the second a pollution&#13;
control fund targeting small investments and small-scale enterprises. The two fertilizer&#13;
factories alone produce 16 percent of all available phosphorus discharged into the Waihai&#13;
and 73 percent of the total industrial phosphorus loads. Their existing wastewater treatment&#13;
facilities lack adequate design capacity for their loads and frequent equipment breakdowns&#13;
reduce treatrnent still further. Price controls on much of their output force them to operate&#13;
at a loss on those products, made up through government subsidies. The proposed&#13;
investment in the factories (detailed in Annex 12) would radically change their production&#13;
processes, intermediate, and some final outputs, allowing profitable operation and much&#13;
cleaner production. Phosphorus discharges would drop from 93 tons annually to below&#13;
2 tons, and those of other pollutants would also decline. The estimated economic rates of&#13;
return for the plants are 24 (Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Factory) and 36 (Kunming&#13;
Chemical Fertilizer Factory) percent, independent of any continued environmental damage.&#13;
The latter is too low to reflect in the lake water quality model, so the overall returns are&#13;
judged to be positive. These investments represent win-win solutions unavailable through&#13;
normal financing mechanisms due to the continued downward pressure on profits through&#13;
price controls. The fertilizer price control policy itself, and possible overuse of fertilizer&#13;
resulting from that policy, are national issues with possible repercussions on Dianchi Lake&#13;
pollution loads, but are not addressed in this analysis. The second subcomponent-a&#13;
subloan facility-would provide financing to assist small-scale enterprises within the&#13;
Dianchi Basin to control pollution through waste minimization measures, modifications or&#13;
renovations to existing plants to reduce waste outputs, or recycle waste generated during&#13;
production.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
6.12   The project would contribute significantly to the improvement of water quality in&#13;
heavily populated areas of Yunnan. In particular water quality in Dianchi Lake, the&#13;
principal focus of the project, will be substantially improved by a comprehensive program&#13;
of interventions based on removal of phosphorus from wastewater discharges to the lake.&#13;
The proposed project would reduce phosphorus loads to approximately half the "do&#13;
nothing" loads, and two-thirds of current loads. This will arrest the eutrophication of the&#13;
lake, which is reaching a critical stage, in particular in terms of water treatment problems,&#13;
and will permit the sustained use of the lake for water supply, thereby avoiding costly&#13;
import of water from distant catchments. The Environmental Assessment summary in&#13;
Annex 7 provides details.&#13;
6.13  Although the balance of the environmental impact is substantially positive, potential&#13;
adverse impacts from waste disposal and industrial pollution control components require&#13;
the classification of the project as Category A in terms of the Operational Directive on&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA). Accordingly, a comprehensive EA has been prepared&#13;
covering all project components and has been reviewed by the Bank/IDA and approved by&#13;
NEPA. The complete EA report is in the project files (Annex.16) and a summary is given&#13;
in Annex 7. Appropriate mitigation measures for the potential, but minor, negative project&#13;
impacts have been identified in the EA. The resettlement impact of the project will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
managed through a resettlement action plan that is in the project files and is summarized in&#13;
Annex 6.&#13;
D. AFFORDABILITY AND POVERTY ASSESSMENT&#13;
6.14   The affordability issue arises only with the water and wastewater components of the&#13;
proposed project. The industrial pollution interventions will proceed only if the enterprises&#13;
can demonstrate that they will remain financially sound after the investment, and solid&#13;
waste charges will rise only for industrial and commercial users of the new landfills.&#13;
Affordability of the new water and wastewater systems was tested against current&#13;
consumption patterns and average income of the poorest 10 percent of the urban population&#13;
in the three cities. The proposed first-year tariff would consume an average of less than 2&#13;
percent of the income of the poorest 10 percent of the population, with wastewater fees&#13;
based on 80 percent of water used in Gejiu and Qujing, and 100 percent in Kunming.&#13;
Indeed, because the poor are less likely than other households to have water piped to the&#13;
house (using standpipes instead, for which no fees are currently charges), even the 2 percent&#13;
figure represents an upper bound.&#13;
6.15  The affordability of the higher tariffs anticipated in later years will clearly depend&#13;
on changes in real income among the urban poor over time. In real terms, within five years&#13;
the tariffs will increase to as much as 50 percent above the 1996 rate. With no change in&#13;
real income and no consumption effect, the average water and wastewater bills would&#13;
increase to about 3 percent of average income for the poorest 10 percent of households.&#13;
However, over the past decade, the real incomes of the urban poor have risen in line with&#13;
overall income increases. If that pattern, and overall real personal income growth,&#13;
continues near current rates, water and wastewater tariffs as a percentage of personal&#13;
income would climb only slightly above the first-year level. In absolute terms, the increase&#13;
would be fully offset by first-year income gains.&#13;
E. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.1    The proposed project faces or mitigates a variety of risks. Those risks are here&#13;
grouped under three general headings: implementation and operational risks, regulatory&#13;
risk, and risks to long-term sustainability. Each type of risk is discussed in detail in&#13;
Annex 15. Those findings are summarized below.&#13;
(a)    Project financing presents a risk due to the need for municipal counterpart&#13;
funding.  Among the three cities, Qujing has committed the highest&#13;
percentage of its on-budget resources to the project, with annual project-&#13;
related expenditures reaching 47 percent of projected on-budget revenues in&#13;
1999. However, as noted in para. 5.12, on-budget revenues represent only&#13;
one of many revenue sources by which the cities can support projects. The&#13;
provincial finance bureau has undertaken an independent analysis of&#13;
Qujing's ability to finance the planned works, based on their knowledge of&#13;
the broader financial resources available to the city, and judged the plans&#13;
feasible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
(b)   The shift to new organizational forms of autonomous utilities managed as&#13;
enterprises for wastewater management is critical to project success. Slow&#13;
institutional innovation therefore becomes a project risk Each city is well&#13;
along in the process, having successfully completed the transformation to an&#13;
enterprise. In Kunming, wastewater assets have been revalued and that&#13;
work is being reviewed by the State Asset Bureau, the last step before&#13;
formal transfer to the books of the wastewater enterprise. Qujing and Gejiu&#13;
have already transferred revalued assets to wastewater entity books. The&#13;
groundwork is thus laid for introduction of the new accounting and&#13;
management information systems needed to efficiently guide the work of&#13;
these enterprises. In the long run, efficient operation will also depend on&#13;
cities honoring the autonomy of the enterprises in financial, personnel and&#13;
other management decisions. This element of risk cannot be divorced from&#13;
larger efforts within the economy to reform government relations with the&#13;
state-owned enterprise sector. These issues have recently received thorough&#13;
analysis in the State-Owned Enterprise Reform sector study (currently in&#13;
green cover).&#13;
(c)    The industrial pollution control component creates credit risk borne by the&#13;
provincial government. Under the industrial lending, whether directly to the&#13;
enterprises or through the pollution control fund, provincial government&#13;
would be responsible for repaying any loan that an enterprise could not&#13;
repay. To minimize this risk, an essential element of the project appraisal,&#13;
which is subject to review and confirmation by the provincial finance&#13;
bureau, is analysis of the firm's financial strength and the risk it faces in its&#13;
input and output markets. The firm must meet a 1.4 debt service coverage&#13;
requirement over the project life, providing that margin of safety to the&#13;
government exposure. Furthermore, the loans are being made at no less than&#13;
150 basis points over the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar&#13;
single currency loans, with the enterprise bearing the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
With administrative fees of approximately 50 basis points for the two direct&#13;
industrial loans, the provincial government will capture at least 100 basis&#13;
points to cover their risks. In addition, they will enjoy the use of loan and&#13;
interest payments in the interval between collection from the enterprise and&#13;
repayment to the Ministry of Finance. Administrative costs are higher for&#13;
the pollution control subloans, probably approaching 150 basis points, and&#13;
this would be a revolving account, obviating the premium from early&#13;
recapture of loan funds. Here, any risk premium would have to be added to&#13;
the 150 basis points, or the risk absorbed by the provincial government.&#13;
They have indicated a wish to hold the premium at the 150 basis point level,&#13;
while seeking additional performance guarantees from the local government&#13;
in which any benefiting enterprise is located.&#13;
(d)    Operational risks arise in the industrial pollution control component with&#13;
the failure (documented in China:   Urban Environmental Service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Management) of many enterprises to operate their pollution abatement&#13;
facilities. The analysis addressed the risk that pollution abatement goals&#13;
would not be met. However, the proposed investments involve process&#13;
changes in which little of the treatment element can be isolated from the&#13;
overall production process. The production process itself is inherently much&#13;
cleaner than the original process, leading to the pollution control gains&#13;
expected.&#13;
(e)    Major policy risks include possible resistance to timely implementation of&#13;
the new tariff structure for water and wastewater. Failure to implement&#13;
agreed tariffs would seriously impair the performance incentives of the&#13;
utilities and their ability to finance ongoing investment programs. To&#13;
mitigate this risk, a tariff increase before negotiation is being required and&#13;
tariffs will be a supervision focal point. The latter will be aided by the fact&#13;
that service providers are required to present annual accounts showing&#13;
whether existing tariffs have met their financial needs and to project tariff&#13;
levels needed in the following year.&#13;
(f)    Significant regulatory risks also arise because the pollution control results&#13;
anticipated for the surface waters depend not only on sewerage technologies&#13;
successfully constructed and operated by the cities.  Many important&#13;
pollutants must be controlled at source by the industries generating them. A&#13;
failure to do so could threaten either the sewerage infrastructure or the&#13;
quality of the various lakes and rivers, depending on enterprise discharge&#13;
points. The principal means of mitigating this risk is a strong regulatory&#13;
regime. The importance of this work was recognized during preparation of&#13;
the project and is addressed under the technical assistance component&#13;
(Ann  2).&#13;
(g)   The major risks to long-term sustainability are financial and regulatory, and&#13;
have been discussed above. Additional risks arise from outside of the cities&#13;
themselves and center on polluting inputs to the various water bodies from&#13;
areas beyond municipal control.  These additional pollutants could&#13;
overwhelm any benefit that would otherwise be realized by the planned&#13;
investments. In the case of the network of waterways within the cities, this&#13;
risk is not great. Most of their watersheds are small, pollutants are of local&#13;
origin, and their control will be a function of the proper operation of the&#13;
project. However, Dianchi also suffers from nonpoint source pollutants,&#13;
particularly agricultural, and substantial nutrient loads from upstream&#13;
agriculture as well as poorly regulated township and village industrial&#13;
enterprise pollution discharges. Satisfactory abatement of those polluting&#13;
sources will depend on the actions of a large number of political&#13;
jurisdictions, most of which would suffer no immediate harm from&#13;
continued discharges to lake tributaries. The growing appreciation within&#13;
China of the value of water as a resource and of the importance of water&#13;
pollution abatement offers the best hope of inducing compliance with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
current industrial regulations. A similar appreciation of the risks from&#13;
agriculture has yet to appear, and must become an element of long-run lake&#13;
and river basin quality control.&#13;
&#13;

(b)   The execution of acceptable subsidiary loan agreements between:&#13;
(i) Kunming and Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Plant, and (ii) Yunnan and&#13;
Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant would be conditions of disbursement&#13;
for the loan/credit proceeds allocated to these investments (para. 3.25);&#13;
(c)   Signed contracts, acceptable to the Bank/IDA, between YP and consulting&#13;
firms, for institutional and financial technical assistance, construction&#13;
supervision services, and sector institutional strengthening with respect to&#13;
the Kunming Drainage Company and the Kunming Water Supply&#13;

ANNEX 1: BACKGROUND TO YUNNAN PROVINCE AND&#13;
PROJECT CITIES&#13;
1.    Yunnan Province is located in southwest China and is bordered, clockwise from the&#13;
north, by the following: the Provinces of Sichuan and Guizhou, Guangxi Zhuang&#13;
Autonomous Region, the countries of Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Myanmar, and Tibet&#13;
Autonomous Region. The northwestem area has a temperate climate, being dominated by&#13;
the southeastern Himalayas, where the upper reaches of three great rivers (the Jingshajiang,&#13;
which discharges to the Changjiang [Yangtze]; the Lancangjiang [Mekong]; and the&#13;
Nujiang [Salween]) flow southward barely 80 km apart. In contrast, the southern areas are&#13;
tropical, while central and eastern areas comprise a plateau of red earth and lake basins at an&#13;
elevation of about 2,000 m, and have a subtropical climate. The source of the Nanpanjiang&#13;
(Pearl River) is in the northeast of the Province. The average annual rainfall is between 800&#13;
and 1,000 mm, with low precipitation in the northwest, high in the southeast; 60 percent of&#13;
the rainfall occurs from June to August. The average temperature is 8 to 170C in January;&#13;
1 I to 29°C in July.&#13;
2.    Yunnan Province has a total land area of about 394,000 km2 and a population of&#13;
some 38 million, of which about 15 percent live in urban areas. The Province has the&#13;
largest number (23) of nationalities in China. It is the third poorest, with a 1992 per capita&#13;
gross domestic product (GDP) of Y 1,165 ($134). Over 85 percent of the population earn&#13;
their living from the land, but Yunnan's mountainous terrain leaves only 6 percent of the&#13;
land with a slope of less than 15 percent. Despite difficult growing conditions, agriculture&#13;
managed a respectable 5.4 percent growth rate from 1980 to 1992; however this was&#13;
insufficient to fully employ the agricultural labor force which, as elsewhere in China,&#13;
remains much in excess of requirements. In recent years, underemployed rural labor has&#13;
taken advantage of new freedom of movement to seek work in the industrial and service&#13;
sectors that are themselves concentrated in urban areas.&#13;
3.    Industry employs only 7 percent of the 20 million strong labor force. It grew at an&#13;
average rate of 11.1 percent a year from 1980 to 1992, and now accounts for 41.1 percent of&#13;
Yunnan's GDP. The service sector has grown even faster, at 11.5 percent a year over the&#13;
same period, and now contributes 17.7 percent of GDP, employing 13.5 percent of the labor&#13;
force. Improvements in provincial road and rail transport, with an attendant lowering of&#13;
travel costs, and the opening up of international borders with Viet Nam, Lao PDR and&#13;
Myanmar, should all help sustain momentum for industrial, service and urban growth over&#13;
the near term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                     ANNEX 1&#13;
Gejiu&#13;
4.    Gejiu Municipality comprises an area of 1,876 km2 and a population of 337,000.&#13;
Gejiu City, a tin and nonferrous metal industry city of some 134,000 situated in a mountain&#13;
valley, evolved from the discovery and exploitation of tin. Its primary source of industrial&#13;
water is Lake Gejiu, which suddenly appeared in 1954 after unusually heavy rains. Gejiu&#13;
City faces a situation of too much water/flooding during the wet season and too little water&#13;
during the dry season. Drinking water is piped from a reservoir above the city because&#13;
Lake Gejiu has been polluted to Grade 5 by soil erosion, waste ore-dressing water and&#13;
tailings, urban garbage and sewage, and industrial wastewater. Water volume has been&#13;
reduced from 5.6 million m3 on formation of the lake to 3.2 million m3 in 1994 as a result of&#13;
soil erosion caused by the steady stripping of the extremely steep mountainsides since 1958&#13;
for either forage/firewood or mining activities, and sludge buildup.&#13;
Kunming&#13;
5.    Kunming Municipality is the capital and economic center of Yunnan Province,&#13;
dominating all other cities in both population and economic activity. The population of&#13;
Kunming Municipality was reported at 3.6 million in 1992 with about 1.2 million (about 33&#13;
percent) living in the urban areas and 2.4 million residing in the country areas. Kunming is&#13;
a multiminority city with minority groups representing some 12 percent of the population.&#13;
The municipal population is expected to reach about 3.9 to 4.2 million by year 2000 with&#13;
some 2 million in the urban area.&#13;
6.    There are some 5,000 industrial enterprises located in Kunming, including&#13;
machinery, metallurgy, electrical power, building materials, food processing, chemical and&#13;
textile industries. Many of the industries were established more than 50 years ago.&#13;
Kunming's growth provides jobs for rural migrants and increasing demand for a wide&#13;
variety of agricultural products and industrial raw materials produced in the rural areas.&#13;
Investments in infrastructure have not kept pace with the needs.&#13;
7.    The development of the city has been somewhat uneven. The first master plan for&#13;
the city was produced in 1980 and revised in 1987. The 1987 Plan is currently under&#13;
revision.&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
8.    The first water supply for Kunming dates back to 1915. Since that time, additional&#13;
sources have been developed. Up to about 1962 groundwater abstraction from the&#13;
limestone formations underlying Kunming provided the supply for the city, reported at&#13;
about 130,000 m3/day at that time. Since the early 1960s the city has relied almost wholly&#13;
on surface water supplies. The two main sources are the Songhuaba Reservoir on the&#13;
Panlong River, 13 km northeast of Kunming, and Dianchi Lake. Operational responsibility&#13;
rests with the Kunming Water Supply Company (KWSC) which reports through the Public&#13;
Utilities Bureau to the Construction Commission. Five treatment plants, with a total&#13;
capacity of 410,000 m3/day, have been built and commissioned over the years, the most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61-                      ANNEX 1&#13;
recent being the No. 5 Plant, which was commissioned in 1990. As designed, about 50&#13;
percent of the raw water is abstracted at each source. However, the sources are operated&#13;
conjunctively, with preference being given to drawing excess water from the Songhuaba&#13;
reservoir since this water quality meets the Grade II National Environmental Quality&#13;
Standard for Surface Water. The reservoir embankment has recently been raised to increase&#13;
the storage from 70 million m3 to 230 million m3, primarily for purposes of flood control,&#13;
but the water supply availability is increased to 300,000 m3/day (from 224,000 m3/day).&#13;
9.    In addition to the abstraction from  Dianchi Lake for water supply, some&#13;
200,000 m3/day is withdrawn for industry and agriculture.  Future water availability&#13;
depends on water balance analyses yet to be completed.&#13;
10.   The following issues need to be addressed relating to water quality, quantity and&#13;
reuse from Dianchi Lake.&#13;
Sewerage and Drainage&#13;
11.   Kunming drains naturally toward the Dianchi Lake with the Panlong River and&#13;
many small streams and canals feeding into the lake from the northern side of the city. The&#13;
city center has developed on flat low-lying land with consequent problems for the drainage&#13;
of stormwater and wastewater flows. Construction of a combined drainage system started&#13;
in the 1950s, mainly in the city center. The canals are still used to a large extent in outlying&#13;
areas. Sewerage operation and maintenance is very fragmented at present, there being&#13;
urgent need for a consolidated organizational arrangement covering the whole service.&#13;
12.   A Sewerage Master Plan was prepared in the late 1980s and approved by&#13;
government in 1991. The planning horizon of the SMP is year 2000 and the dry-weather&#13;
wastewater flow at that time was estimated at 643,000 m3/day. Over the years a number of&#13;
pumping stations have been constructed (nine for sewage and nine for storm flows). About&#13;
135 km of pipelines have been built and some 130 km of canals and ditches are used in the&#13;
system. There is an apparent lack of overall planning, and the provisions do not seem to&#13;
have been developed within any longer-term overall drainage strategy, but seem to respond&#13;
to new developing areas in a haphazard way. Seven separate drainage systems have been&#13;
identified, each with its individual treatment facility, comprising the areas of Xin, Yunliang,&#13;
Chuanfang, Mingtong and Jiancao, Jinzhi, Baisha and Baoxiang, and Haigeng. Only two&#13;
sewage treatment plants, with design capacities of 55,000 and 100,000 m /day, are so far&#13;
operational. The proposed total capacity of these various facilities is about 550,000 m3/day,&#13;
although the basis of this estimate needs to be clarified.&#13;
13.   Wastewater issues that need to be addressed include:&#13;
(a)   The development of a comprehensive long-term master plan and wastewater&#13;
strategy for wastewater collection, treatment and disposal, and a phased&#13;
investment program based on the least-cost, sustainable development&#13;
options;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
(b)   Development of realistic design criteria for wastewater treatment design,&#13;
based on current disposal arrangements in Yunnan, where septic tank&#13;
treatment is widely adopted, and considering site-specific raw water analysis&#13;
and data;&#13;
(c)    Cost effectiveness and practicality of providing separate sewer systems in&#13;
existing developed areas; and&#13;
(d)   The need to determine and put in place the most effective institutional&#13;
arrangements for operation and maintenance of sewerage operations city&#13;
wide, in terms of financial and operational viability.&#13;
Solid Waste Management&#13;
14.   Solid Waste Management operations are theoretically decentralized to the district&#13;
level under the District Administrative Governments, although the decision-making&#13;
continues to be taken largely by the Municipal Environmental Sanitation Section (this&#13;
section runs the new landfill sites). Firm data on solid waste operations is scant; Kunming&#13;
Municipal Environmental Sanitation Section records indicate that some 334,000 tons/year&#13;
of solid waste and 233,000 tons/year of nightsoil were dealt with during 1993. The solid&#13;
waste collection fleet comprises about 65 vehicles of two-ton capacity and an equal number&#13;
of five-ton capacity. Some 100 vacuum tankers are deployed to deal with the nightsoil.&#13;
Disposal of solid waste is to various landfill sites around the city. Current disposal is at half&#13;
a dozen uncontrolled dumps on the periphery of the city. Future disposal will be at two&#13;
landfills to be developed as part of this project.&#13;
15.   Nightsoil has traditionally been disposed of as fertilizer in agricultural areas, but this&#13;
outlet is reducing as farmers are becoming reluctant to take nightsoil, preferring to use&#13;
chemical fertilizer now becoming available. As a result a large proportion of nightsoil and&#13;
sludge from the septic tanks is now deposited in the lake or mixed with the sewage for&#13;
treatment prior to being discharged to the lake. The long-term strategy to be adopted to deal&#13;
with this issue is to phase out septic tanks.&#13;
16.   There seems to be no regulation of hazardous waste in Yunnan Province, although a&#13;
proposal for a "Solid Waste Pollution Control and Prevention Law" is expected to be&#13;
approved in late 1994. Classification of categories of .solid waste is urgently needed,&#13;
hazardous waste classification being particularly unclear.&#13;
Qujing&#13;
17.   Qujing Municipality comprises an area of 4,350 km 2 and a population of 220,000.&#13;
Qujing City is the second-largest city in Yunnan after Kunming, with an area of 13.5 km2&#13;
and a current population of about 161,500. It has been targeted by provincial authorities as&#13;
an open city, with foreign investment strongly encouraged. Its population is projected to&#13;
reach 340,000 by the year 2000 and 550,000 by 2010. The city is situated on the&#13;
Nanpanjiang, source of the Zhujiang (Pearl River). Qujing is a water-short area; water is&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
provided to the city from two reservoirs, and in recent years there has been conflict between&#13;
these two sources of demand. In addition, some industries are extracting groundwater for&#13;
their own use, depleting the groundwater supply enough to cause land subsidence in some&#13;
areas. There is little treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater. The Qujing portion&#13;
of the Nanpanjiang exceeds Grade V of the Chinese national water standards, seriously&#13;
affecting the life of the river and that of the Zhujiang, and the well-being of the people and&#13;
cities along their banks.&#13;

ANNEX 2: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Yunnan Province lies in the southwest corner of China. The province has a&#13;
population of about 38 million, and is one of the poorest in China, with large numbers of&#13;
the rural population living below the official poverty level. Many major rivers pass through&#13;
Yunnan providing ample water resources at the provincial level. Although Yunnan is&#13;
predominantly a rural province, the urban areas of Kunming, Qujing and other centers have&#13;
been growing rapidly over the last two decades, experiencing migration from rural areas and&#13;
other provinces.&#13;
2.    The province has undergone rapid industrialization as government at all levels has&#13;
sought to broaden the mainly agricultural economic base. This has been achieved through a&#13;
strategy of processing the many agricultural products, prior to export, and exploiting the&#13;
province's large mineral resources such as tin, phosphates and coal. Industrialization has&#13;
occurred in both rural and urban areas, with large processing factories, such as steel&#13;
smelters, being established within the city limits, and many small-scale township and&#13;
village enterprises (TVEs) set up in rural areas. As a result, the provincial gross domestic&#13;
product (GDP) has grown at a rate of over 10 percent per year over the last decade.&#13;
3.    The benefits of this recent economic expansion have also resulted in serious&#13;
environmental degradation.  Urban redevelopment, funded by increased wealth, and&#13;
industrialization have increased water demand substantially. In these areas, traditional&#13;
nightsoil collection has been replaced with sewerage systems, while yard taps have been&#13;
replaced with indoor multifaucet connections allowing increasing use of washing machines&#13;
and other water-using appliances, consistent with increasing prosperity of the urban&#13;
dwellers. This has resulted in ever-increasing demands for expanded water supply systems,&#13;
and consequent discharge of untreated domestic and industrial wastewater into water&#13;
courses due to inadequate collection and treatment facilities. The generation of solid waste&#13;
in urban areas is increasing rapidly, particularly packaging, plastic and other&#13;
noncompostable materials associated with rising income levels. In particular, industrial&#13;
waste, containing toxic and hazardous materials, poses a major disposal problem. At&#13;
present, domestic and industrial waste is disposed not to sanitary landfills but to&#13;
uncontrolled dump sites and part composted, resulting in hazards to farmers, and pollution&#13;
of watercourses from leachate seepage from the dump sites.&#13;
4.    This project focuses on three areas in Yunnan where the economies and&#13;
environmental conditions particularly reflect the situation outlined above. These are (a) the&#13;
Lake Dianchi Basin Catchment, which includes Kunming, the largest city in the province&#13;
and the political and commercial capital of Yunnan; (b) Qujing city; and (c) Gejiu city.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
5.    Kunming is located at the north end of Lake Dianchi. Although Yunnan is rich in&#13;
water resources, the Dianchi catchment is a water-scarce area. Ever-increasing domestic&#13;
and industrial demands cause conflict with existing agricultural and irrigation water uses.&#13;
Kunming draws its water supply in part from Lake Dianchi and partly from the Songhuaba&#13;
reservoir, which was originally built to serve irrigation demands in areas to the north and&#13;
east of Kunming city. At present most of the domestic wastewater from Kunming's 1.2&#13;
million residents, together with industrial wastewater flows, is discharged largely untreated&#13;
into Lake Dianchi through various streams and watercourses flowing through the city areas.&#13;
As a result, the lake has become polluted and eutrophication is occurring, caused by&#13;
excessive nutrient discharges (mainly phosphorus and nitrogen). These nutrients originate&#13;
from domestic sewage and certain industrial activities, such as fertilizer production. Two&#13;
large fertilizer factories, situated at the south end of the lake are major contributors of&#13;
phosphorus to the lake. This deterioration in water quality in the lake is such that one of the&#13;
city's water works has been closed down due to the poor water quality. Songhuaba&#13;
catchment, which now provides more than 50 percent of Kunming's water supplies, is being&#13;
used increasingly for high-intensity agricultural and industrial activities. Protection of this&#13;
catchment is also important to prevent degradation of the water quality in the reservoir and&#13;
safeguard this water resource for Kunming.&#13;
6.    The Yunnan Provincial Government has recognized the need to halt and reverse this&#13;
environmental decline and has initiated various actions to address this issue. Environmental&#13;
Protection Bureaus at all levels of government, established in line with central government&#13;
mandates, have initiated monitoring of environmental conditions and regulation of&#13;
industrial discharges. In addition, Kunming Municipality has established a Lake Dianchi&#13;
Protection Committee.&#13;
7.    The Caohai, or inner Lake Dianchi, which accounts for 2.5 percent of the lake area,&#13;
receives about 50 percent of Kunming's wastewater, and is seriously polluted. The Caohai&#13;
has recently been separated from the outer lake (the Waihai) by an earthen bund which is&#13;
fitted with control gates, and a 4.5 km long tunnel (Xiyuan Tunnel) constructed to discharge&#13;
water from the Caohai to a tributary of the Tanglangchuan River. The objectives of this&#13;
construction are (a) to increase the flood protection capacity of the lake; and (b) to prevent&#13;
polluted water from the Caohai from entering the main outer lake water body.&#13;
8.    Actions have been taken to substitute Songhuaba water with Dianchi water for&#13;
irrigation uses, thus freeing more higher-quality water from Songhuaba reservoir for&#13;
Kunming's water supply. Demand management measures have been initiated, including the&#13;
establishment of a Water Savings Office to help reduce wastage and unaccounted-for water.&#13;
Domestic solid waste collection is reasonably effective in the city's central areas but needs&#13;
to be expanded to include the suburban areas.&#13;
9.    Qujing lies on the Nanpanjiang River, which is a tributary of the Pearl River system,&#13;
about 120 km northeast from Kunming. The city is the second largest in the province, with&#13;
a current population of about 161,500, and is expanding rapidly with an anticipated&#13;
population of some 570,000 by year 2020. The area is rich in natural resources with many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
industries established in and around Qujing including chemical, metal processing, textiles,&#13;
plastics, tobacco and automobile industries. The environmental problems in Qujing are&#13;
similar to those experienced by Kunming, resulting from inadequate municipal&#13;
environmental services that have failed to keep pace with the urban growth.&#13;
10.   Gejiu city is located some 300 km to the southeast from Kumning, has a present&#13;
population around 134,000. This figure is expected to reach some 180,000 by the year&#13;
2020. The city has developed around Gejiu Lake, which was formed some 50 years ago as&#13;
a result of flood events. The economy of Gejiu depends almost entirely on tin mining and&#13;
processing activities in and around the city.&#13;
11.   The proposed project will include both immediate interventions to reduce&#13;
environmental pollution and longer-term initiatives to support a sustainable and equitable&#13;
framework for economic growth. There is urgent need to halt and reverse the current&#13;
downward spiral of environmental degradation in the selected urban areas. Achieving&#13;
sustainable and equitable development requires a blend of integrated institutional, financial&#13;
and technical actions. The specific objectives of the project are to (a) strengthen policies,&#13;
regulations, and institutional arrangements for pollution control, municipal wastewater,&#13;
solid waste and nightsoil management; (b) support the improvement of the lakes&#13;
environment in Gejiu and Kunming in order to allow the waters to be used for domestic and&#13;
industrial supply and in agriculture; (c) support complimentary investments in pollution&#13;
control and municipally-provided urban environmental services; and (d) introduce a&#13;
comprehensive approach to planning, prioritization, and financing of urban environmental&#13;
infrastructure investments.&#13;

Kunming Municipal Solid Waste Management&#13;
12.   Kunming, the province's major city , is rapidly developing; its older, urban center is&#13;
under massive redevelopment; and its suburbs are continually expanding. Its current&#13;
population is approximately 1.2 million, which according to the city's Master Plan is&#13;
expected to increase to 2.2 million by 2005. The collection of solid waste in the city's&#13;
urban districts is being carried out in a satisfactory manner, but collection in suburban&#13;
districts is constrained by a lack of vehicles, fewer staff and longer collection distances.&#13;
Disposal of the city's 9,000 tpd (1,000 tpd domestic, 8,000 tpd other) at seven informal&#13;
dump sites is the most pressing problem. In order for waste arrangement facility to be able&#13;
to cope with this growth, more efficient, long term solutions need to be developed.&#13;
Population and Solid Waste Generation Trends&#13;
13.   Kunming municipality consists of four major districts, two urban, Panlong and&#13;
Wuhua, and two peri-urban or suburban districts, Guandu and Xishan. Population densities&#13;
2&#13;
differ markedly ranging from approximately 8,000 inhabitants/kM  in Xishan to almost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
35,000 inhabitants/km' for Panlong. The 1995 populations of Guandu and Xishan were&#13;
533,000 and 284,000, respectively. It is these areas that will experience the most growth in&#13;
the future with expected populations reaching 715,000 and 374,000, respectively, by 2005.&#13;
In contrast, the populations of Panlong and Wuhua are both close to 500,000, but they are&#13;
expected to grow by only some 16 percent by 2005. Currently most of the domestic,&#13;
market, and commercial wastes and street sweepings are collected in Panlong and Wuhua&#13;
but not in Guandu and Xishan. It is expected that annual waste generation will follow these&#13;
population trends.&#13;
14.   In 1993, the solid waste collection rates in the two urban districts were 870 tpd, and&#13;
for the two suburban districts only 86 tpd, indicating a low efficiency of collection in those&#13;
districts. A visit to these areas generally confirms that much of the waste is not collected&#13;
but thrown along the street or in drains. An estimate of this quantity is 400 tpd. On the&#13;
positive side, the most recent data (1994) suggests that some 1,032 tpd are being collected&#13;
in Kunming.&#13;
Waste Composition Trends&#13;
15.   The major expected trend in waste composition will be toward lower density as the&#13;
ash content decreases. In areas where coal is used as fuel, ash compromises almost&#13;
3&#13;
70 percent of the solid waste, resulting in a density of almost 600 kg/mi. In areas where gas&#13;
is used, there is a complete absence of ashes, resulting in a density of only 370 kg/mi. The&#13;
organic fraction (mainly kitchen residues) changes appreciably, representing only&#13;
20 percent in areas where coal is used but 75 percent in areas with gas. The corollary is that&#13;
the daily per capita waste generation in coal-burning areas is between 0.8 and 0.9 kg and in&#13;
those with gas it is 0.35. These trends will have a significant impact on the collection and&#13;
disposal system but for regional planning purposes, a figure of 0.5 kg/capita/d is still&#13;
frequently used.&#13;
Current Management Practices&#13;
16.   Existing Collection Methods.  There are several categories of daily waste&#13;
collection practices in Kunming. There is a combination of 220 liter bins (4,000 in&#13;
number); apartment house chutes into I mi3 bins; the use of concrete "vats" into which&#13;
residents deposit their refuse; and the use of compactor trucks on the "bell" system. Much&#13;
of the waste collected by handcarts and tricycles goes to eight small transfer stations (STS)&#13;
located in the urban areas. There are no transfer stations in the suburban districts of Guandu&#13;
and Xishan.&#13;
17.   Collection vehicles include a combination of handcarts (609), tricycles (214) and&#13;
close to 150 trucks, ranging in capacity from 0.45 to 5.0 tons. Many of the smaller vehicles,&#13;
bicycles and tricycles (0.45 to 2.0 tons) are operated in the urban areas with very few&#13;
vehicles working the suburban districts. Staff resources for collection total just over 3,000&#13;
for the two urban districts and approximately 400 for the suburban areas. Clearly, many of&#13;
the staff in the urban areas are street sweepers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
18.   Collection issues include a heavy reliance on manual labor, resulting in double&#13;
handling where bicycles and tricycles are involved without a unified container system. In&#13;
addition, the 220 liter bins have a life of only two years due to mechanical damnage and&#13;
corrosion; the 7 m3 containers used at the STSs appear to be too small; and compactor&#13;
trucks are not considered useful since the waste does not compact easily. A more important&#13;
point is that the efficiency of collection is low and some areas are either not served or&#13;
served badly.&#13;
19.   Current Disposal Methods. Disposal as currently practiced is haphazard, with&#13;
much of the waste dumped in open areas around the city. In Xishan and Guandu there is&#13;
evidence of extensive dumping in open areas and alongside rivers and roads. During the&#13;
last 10 to 15 years some 2.8 million tons have been dumped at seven sites around the city.&#13;
The two largest sites, Wanglonqing in the northwest and Laohuashan in the east have&#13;
received approximately 2.4 million tons. All these sites represent environmental hazards,&#13;
since there is leachate collection, compaction or daily cover. One of the objectives of this&#13;
project will be to close these sites.&#13;
Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
20.   Overall management responsibility for the collection and disposal of solid waste in&#13;
the Municipality of Kunming rests with the Kunming City Appearance Committee;&#13;
leadership and guidance is provided by the Kunming Municipal Environmental Sanitation&#13;
Section. This Section is developing the new landfills proposed for Kunming. The actual&#13;
collection and transfer of wastes to the dump sites is undertaken by the District&#13;
Environmental Sanitation Sections (DESS).&#13;
Strategies for the 21st Century&#13;
21.   As the population and suburban infrastructure of the city continue to grow, a new&#13;
and modem management approach to the solid waste problem needs to be taken. Major&#13;
investments are required, including transfer stations; a broad range of collection vehicles,&#13;
each suited to a specific purpose; heavy, large transfer vehicles; and state-of-the-art&#13;
landfills. The municipality has made a conscious decision to move in this direction with the&#13;
assistance of Bank/IDA financing for equipment and institutional investmnents. Investments&#13;
that are under consideration include low-technology collection vehicles such as tricycles,&#13;
minitrucks, rear-loading trucks; small and medium transfer stations; landfills and attendant&#13;
facilities; training; special studies and other types of institutional development activities.&#13;
22.   These modem solutions require significant capital expenditure and therefore require&#13;
cost recovery schemes. To date, very little revenue has been collected for domestic refuse&#13;
collection, but a new law (September 22, 1995) has been enacted authorizing the collection&#13;
of fees. The fee for household waste was established at Y 5 per household per month, to be&#13;
collected by the environmental sanitation department of the operating district. Enterprises&#13;
and government units will have to pay rates ranging from Y 60 to Y 70 per month, but it is&#13;
not clear if this is a flat or per ton charge. To date there are no plans for administrative units&#13;
to collect these fees and provide accounting and other financial services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
Recommended Collection and Transfer Approach&#13;
23.   Expected Waste Generation and Composition. The domestic waste collection&#13;
forecast for the year 2000 is some 1,512 tpd increasing to 1,646 tpd by the year 2005. The&#13;
fraction of households using gas is estimated to be about 70 percent in 2000 rising to almost&#13;
75 percent by 2005. However, the average per capita generation rate stays about the same,&#13;
between 0.45 and 0.49 kg, because per capita waste generation rises with expected&#13;
prosperity but falls with the increasing use of gas. The effects of these two factors appear to&#13;
be compensating. Discussions with urban planners and a willingness to pay survey carried&#13;
out by YEPO (August 1995) indicated that roughly 1,500 tons of domestic waste will be&#13;
collected in the year 2000.&#13;
24.   Vehicles and Containers Required. In order to deal with the above waste&#13;
quantities in the year 2000, trends in composition and source characteristics, the following&#13;
collection vehicles will need to be procured under this project (there are additional vehicles&#13;
needed, but they will be procured using local funds):&#13;
(a)   40, 2.5 t small compactor trucks&#13;
(b)   40, 12 m3 fore and aft trucks&#13;
(c)   26, 16 m3 container carrying trucks&#13;
(d)   22,24 m3 container carrying trucks&#13;
(e)   5, 1.7 m3 loaders at each MTS&#13;
(f)   5, mini-bus and cars at each MTS&#13;
(g)   52, 16 m3 containers&#13;
(h)   50, 24 m3 containers&#13;
Note: A large number of smaller bins and plastic containers will also be procured using&#13;
local funds.&#13;
25.   Transfer Stations Required. Small transfer stations (STSs) able to receive wastes&#13;
from cyclists and minitrucks are needed for many urban areas. As of November 1995,&#13;
some 8 STSs were in operation handling about 30 tpd during a 5- to 6-hour shift. The old&#13;
STSs have limited storage capacity and 13 new STSs are therefore recommended. These&#13;
new stations will be capable of handling 60 tpd through the use of 16 m3 bins that can easily&#13;
loaded directly on to trucks. These stations will collect some 600 tpd delivered by&#13;
minitrucks and the private sector, which will be transported directly to the landfills.&#13;
26.   Five new medium-size transfer stations (MTSs) will be required to receive wastes&#13;
from STSs and larger, rear-loading trucks. These stations would handle 900 tpd through&#13;
16 m3 containers as well, which could handle some 15,000 kg of refuse of density&#13;
600 kg/m3. These stations would be at sites outside the two urban areas so that they could&#13;
easily serve larger areas.&#13;
27.   In addition to the transfer stations, transfer trucks will be required. The existing and&#13;
new STSs will need 26 trucks capable of carrying 16 m3 containers. The new MTSs will&#13;
require 22 arm-roll trucks capable of carrying 24 m3 containers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
Recommended Disposal Approach&#13;
28.   Two major landfills are proposed under this project, the Honshuitang site, located&#13;
19 km to the northwest of Kunming, and the Baishuitang site located 20 km to the&#13;
southeast. These two locations were selected from some 25 sites within 30 km of Kunming&#13;
that were under consideration earlier in the project cycle. Honshuitang will receive about&#13;
600 to 700 tpd during its first phase of 11 years. Its effective volume is about 10 million m3&#13;
and it should have a life of 21 years. Baishuitang has the same effective volume and will&#13;
receive approximately 900 tpd during its first phase of 13 years. Its life has also been&#13;
estimated at 21 years.&#13;
29.   A minimum of infrastructure is already in place at Honshuitang, and geotechnical&#13;
investigations have begun and the site acquired. The Baishuitang site will be leased under a&#13;
30-year agreement for Y 150,000 annually.&#13;
Hongshuitang Landfill&#13;
30.   Site Characteristics. The Hongshuitang site has several geotechnical problems that&#13;
require resolution. The operational part of the site covers an area of approximately&#13;
0.65 km2 that will be developed in three phases. The site is bifurcated by a fault line&#13;
running north and south in a karst limestone area. The area has a number of karst fissures&#13;
and funnels that will be filled with a soil cement mix. The area is low to moderately hilly,&#13;
with a natural slope and change in elevation of about 115 m in the shape of an ellipse. It is&#13;
a recharge area for a perched aquifer with the flow in the direction of Songshanpu Spring.&#13;
However, the larger regional groundwater system does not appear to be affected by&#13;
precipitation falling on the site. The engineering geology includes slope deposited red clay&#13;
of varying depth throughout the site, at 2 to 5 m. Although the permeability coefficient&#13;
varies widely, a figure of 4.14xlO7 cm/sec is cited (ideal is 10- cm/sec), making it a&#13;
relatively favorable site. There also appears to be some seismic risk, which is prevalent&#13;
throughout the area. Detailed design features will be incorporated in order to take account&#13;
of this risk.&#13;
31.   Facility Design. The site will be developed in three phases, each constructed&#13;
separately and operated as needed over the life of the landfill. Three of the most critical&#13;
aspects of landfill design are the liner, leachate collection and treatment system, and a&#13;
surface water drainage system around the periphery of the site. The proposed liner includes&#13;
a 30 cm bottom clay layer, a geomembrane, 20 cm of coarse sand, a second geomembrane&#13;
topped with 10 cm of clay. The geomembrane will not be used throughout the site, in&#13;
critical areas where the natural clay liner is too thin. Based on the drawings, some 30&#13;
percent of the landfill will be lined with synthetic material. The leachate collection system&#13;
consists of a pattern of gravel drains inside a circular geotextile fabric. There will be no&#13;
leachate treatment system, but instead a retention pond or tank meeting first phase needs&#13;
with a volume of 20,000 m3. The leachate is to be recirculated through the landfill to be&#13;
absorbed and evaporated. The size of the pond has been calculated to meet needs during the&#13;
rainy season and therefore there should not be any net flow from the system. In order to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71-                      ANNEX2&#13;
prevent runoff from adjacent areas from entering the site a series of peripheral drains will&#13;
constructed. The flow will be drained without treatment via the Shalang River. Gas&#13;
coming from the landfill is to be collected via the vertical lines in the leachate collection&#13;
system and flared.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
32.   A program of institutional strengthening would be undertaken in order that the&#13;
investments proposed will be sustainable over the long term and that the responsible&#13;
agencies will be able to meet continuing challenges. This program will consist of a study&#13;
on industrial and hazardous waste management in the Dianchi basin, technical assistance on&#13;
the development of improved collection vehicles, technical assistance for improved&#13;
management at municipal and district environmental sanitation sections; an impact&#13;
marketing study; and a regional solid waste management study.&#13;
33.   Proposed Component ($28.1 million). The proposed component would comprise&#13;
the following works:&#13;
(a)   Hongshuitang Landfill comprising site preparation and construction of a&#13;
new landfill with capacity of about 9 million (M) mi3 at a site some 19 km to&#13;
the northwest of the city, including leachate and gas collection/treatment&#13;
systems, site facilities and operational vehicles and plant.&#13;
(b)   Baishuitang Landfill comprising sitepreparation and construction of a new&#13;
landfill with capacity of about 10 Mm at a site some 20 km to the southeast&#13;
of the city, including leachate and gas collection/treatment systems, site&#13;
facilities and operational vehicles and plant.&#13;
(c)   Transfer Stations. Construction of about 18 transfer stations throughout&#13;
the city.&#13;
(d)   Collection and Transportation Vehicles.  Procurement of about 138&#13;
collection and tr;nsportation vehicles in sizes between 3 and 24 m3 capacity&#13;
and about 102 containers of 16 m3 and 24 m3 capacity.&#13;
(e)   Institutional Development and Training.  Provision of institutional&#13;
development and practical training for both management and operational&#13;
personnel, with particular attention being given to the control, management&#13;
and monitoring necessary for effective sanitary landfill operations.&#13;
Kunming Water Supply&#13;
34.   The present population provided with water supply from the municipal system in&#13;
Kunming is estimated around 1.49 million (84.5 percent of the total population). This&#13;
number is projected to reach 2.41 million in the year 2020, representing some 90 percent of&#13;
the total population projected at that time. Average water demand projections, based on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
gross per capita figures (covering domestic, commercial and industrial uses), ranging from&#13;
305 I/c/d in 1995 to 355 lIc/d in 2020, are estimated around 538,000 m3/d in 1995 rising to&#13;
some 953,000 m3/d by year 2020. Peak demands are estimated at 619,000 and 1,096,000&#13;
m3/d respectively in 1995 and 2020, thus demonstrating a clear need to augment the&#13;
availability of fully treated water in the short term, to meet the demand forecasts.&#13;
35.   Water resources are presently drawn from Lake Dianchi, Songhuaba reservoir and&#13;
groundwater in the ratio 57:40:3 percent respectively. The Songhuaba reservoir built in&#13;
1958, was raised by 14.7 m in 1994 in order to increase storage for flood protection and&#13;
potable water use, although, as yet, the water level has not been raised to the new maximum&#13;
storage level due to resettlement and related issues that are not resolved. Alternative&#13;
proposals to reduce the area of land to be inundated at the upstream end of the reservoir are&#13;
included in this project.&#13;
36.   It is reported that in 1995 analyses of Songhuaba water indicate good quality&#13;
generally complying with Grade II of Chinese Standard 3838, apart from occasional high&#13;
manganese values. On the other hand, Lake Dianchi water quality has deteriorated&#13;
significantly over recent years, in the range Grade III to below Grade V of the standard. As&#13;
a consequence, the Kunming Water Supply Company (KWSC) decided to maximize the&#13;
use of water from the Songhuaba source. The existing treatment capacities and water&#13;
sources are summarized as follows:&#13;
Capacity                             Peak Demand, m3/d&#13;

37.   The treatment process adopted by KWSC for the good quality Songhuaba water&#13;
consists of chemically assisted flocculation, tube module settlement, rapid gravity filtration,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
chlorination and storage. In the case of Lake Dianchi water, dissolved air flotation, dual&#13;
media filters, ozonation and powdered activated carbon are being provided at the WTP&#13;
No. 6B which is currently under construction.&#13;
38.   KWSC and its consultants evaluated a number of alternative strategies for the&#13;
augmentation of treated water supplies for Kunming, and selected the least cost option&#13;
based on conjunctive use of the Dianchi Lake and Songhuaba sources, maximizing the use&#13;
of the better quality Songhuaba resource.&#13;
39.   Under this project, the capacity of WTP No. 1 would be extended by 70,000 mr3/d&#13;
and the 100,000 m /d first phase of a new WTP at Beijiaochang would be provided. These&#13;
works would be supplied through a new 1,600 mm diameter pipeline from Songhuaba&#13;
reservoir. Thus the total treatment capacity for the city would be increased to around&#13;
765,000 m3/d, which would meet the 2005 average demand. The further expansion of&#13;
Beijiaochang works to 200,000 m3/d would be required to meet future demand. The project&#13;
includes the provision of distribution pipework and system connections and a storage&#13;
reservoir of 10,000 m3 capacity for treated water, located on high ground some 4 km to the&#13;
west of Beijiaochang.&#13;
40.   Proposed Component ($40.3 million). The proposed component is as follows:&#13;
(a)   Songhuaba Raw  Water Pipeline comprising pressure pipeline of&#13;
prestressed concrete construction, or other materials, in sizes about 1,000 to&#13;
1,600 mm diameter, control valves and facilities, of about 13.5 km total&#13;
length.&#13;
(b)   Beijiaochang  Water  Treatment  Plant  comprising  flocculation,&#13;
clarification, filtration, chlorination, storage, pumping and ancillary&#13;
facilities, of about 100,000 m3/d capacity.&#13;
(c)   Xiaotunshan Storage Reservoir of reinforced concrete construction with a&#13;
capacity of about 10,000 mi3.&#13;
(d)   Distribution System Connections comprising pressure pipelines of steel,&#13;
prestressed concrete or other materials, totaling about 12 km in sizes about&#13;
800 to 1,200 mm diameter.&#13;
(e)   Water Treatment Plant No. 1 Extension comprising flocculation,&#13;
clarification, filtration, chlorination, storage, pumping and ancillary&#13;
facilities, of about 70,000 m3/d capacity.&#13;
(f)   Metering and Equipment of Unaccounted-for Water Management&#13;
comprising flow/pressure measuring, leak detection, meters and related&#13;
equipment.&#13;

Kunming Wastewater&#13;
41.   A Sewerage Master Plan for Kunming was prepared with bilateral assistance and&#13;
approved in 1990. This plan, although somewhat overtaken by unplanned development, has&#13;
provided the basis for sewerage investments to date in Kunming.&#13;
42.   Wastewater flows from the central and suburban areas of Kunming have been&#13;
projected through 2020 (the adopted planning horizon), by considering various assumptions&#13;
for growth, access to sewer connections and water use projections. Based on the adopted&#13;
scenario, which is considered appropriate and consistent with the city development&#13;
projections, wastewater flows are projected to reach about 780,000 m3/d by 2020, with&#13;
rapid growth expected in the suburban areas. Details are summarized as follows:&#13;
Kunming Total Wastewater m3/d&#13;
1995           2000           2010           2020&#13;
City center        170,500        206,800        246,100         271,600&#13;
Suburbs                  -        181,100         361,100        508,500&#13;
Total           170,500         387,900        607,200        780,100&#13;
43.   Wastewater treatment in Kunming is limited to two sewage treatment works (Nos. 1&#13;
and 2) of capacity 55,000 m /d and 100,000 m3/d, which treat water pumped from an&#13;
adjacent river in the southern and eastern areas of the city. Further STWs (Nos. 3 and 4A&#13;
covering the northern and western areas of the city) are under construction. When&#13;
commissioned, these new works would increase the treatment capacity to about&#13;
210,000 m3/d, substantially below the projected need, even for the short term. Some&#13;
combined sewer systems cover the old downtown area, and at present most urban&#13;
wastewater is ultimately discharged to the Dianchi Lake, largely to the Waihai, contributing&#13;
to organic pollution of the lake and contributing a substantial proportion of the loads of&#13;
nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), thereby enhancing the lake eutrophication.&#13;
44.   An important focus of the wastewater treatment proposals is therefore the removal&#13;
of both nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater. This will be achieved by the design&#13;
of the activated sludge system proposed for all wastewater treatment plants to remove both&#13;
nitrogen and phosphorus. This involves a staged anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic activated&#13;
sludge process (the A20 process) to remove in the order of 75 percent of the phosphorus&#13;
and nitrogen loads.&#13;
45.   The project would support the construction of comprehensive interceptor sewer&#13;
systems throughout city and suburban areas to ensure that wastewater is conveyed to the&#13;

treatment locations. Additional wastewater treatment capacity of about 190,000 m3/d in&#13;
city and suburban areas would also be included, bringing the total capacity to around&#13;
545,000 m3/d at the end of the project. This would meet the anticipated need through year&#13;
2008 and beyond in the event that development and wastewater flows are below the&#13;
assumed projections.&#13;

Small Towns Wastewater&#13;
47.   This component comprises the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater&#13;
from the county towns of Chenggong and Jinning, which lie in the catchment area of Lake&#13;
Dianchi. At present, the domestic and industrial wastewaters from both these towns&#13;
discharge directly into the lake, contributing significantly to the nutrient pollution of the&#13;
lake (3 to 6 percent of the total). The present population at Chenggong is reported about&#13;
30,000, this is expected to reach some 167,000 by year 2020 according to the Chenggong&#13;
County Master Plan. Wastewater flow projections for Chenggong estimate the flow at&#13;
about 15,000 m'/d in 2010, rising to about 30,000 m'/d by year 2020. The Jinning&#13;
population is reported about 30,000 at present, and projected to reach 80-100,000 by year&#13;
2020, with wastewater flows projected in the range 11,000 to 17,600 m3/d in 2010 and 2020&#13;
respectively.&#13;
48.   Proposed Component ($15.2 million). The proposed component would comprise&#13;
the following works:&#13;
(a)   Chenggong Sewerage System including the construction of about 23 km of&#13;
trunk and secondary sewers in sizes about 300 to 900 mm diameter.&#13;
(b)   Chenggong Sewage Treatment Works of capacity about 15,000 m3/d&#13;

comprising screens, pumping, grit removal, primary clarification, biological&#13;
treatment based on the activated sludge process and incorporating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
phosphorus and nitrogen removal, secondary clarification, sludge treatment&#13;
and disposal, ancillary and administrative facilities.&#13;
Rural Sanitation&#13;
49.   Proposed Component ($2.3 million). The objective of this component is to&#13;
demonstrate appropriate wastewater treatment technology for replication in the rural areas&#13;
of the Dianchi and Songhuaba catchments. The project includes three pilot projects in the&#13;
villages of Dounan, Wulong and Xiaohe. Specifically, these pilot projects consist of&#13;
village-level wastewater collection and treatment systems, nightsoil and municipal solid&#13;
waste utilization, afforestation, drainage, farm-level environmental improvements and water&#13;
supply. The principal purpose of these investments is to provide a knowledge and empirical&#13;
base for the dissemination of affordable, village-level approaches to waste management.&#13;
50.   In Xiaohe the projects comprise: (a) the use of household-level anaerobic digesters&#13;
for nightsoil and animal waste disposal for the production of gas for cooking and lighting;&#13;
(b) afforestation of some 16,000 mu to reduce soil erosion; (c) improved agricultural waste&#13;
management practices; and (d) a collection system for domestic wastewater currently&#13;
polluting much of the village streets.&#13;
51.   In Dounan, the projects comprise: (a) a 30 tpd composting plant to compost the&#13;
community's municipal soil waste, with the compost being used as soil conditioner for&#13;
degraded, adjacent farmland; (b) improved agricultural waste management practices on&#13;
some 2,700 mu; (c) rehabilitation and expansion of a 500 m31d water supply system; and&#13;
(d) a low-cost wastewater collection and treatment system using a land treatment approach.&#13;
52.   In Walong the projects comprise:  (a) 1,000 household-level composters;&#13;
(b) improved agricultural waste management practices for some 3,000 mu; (c) a well-based&#13;
water supply system of 500 m3/d capacity; (d) a combined drainage system with primary&#13;
sedimentation; (e) a lotus pond wetland for treatment of the effluent coming from (d) above;&#13;
and (f) a hydroponic vegetable production system.&#13;
B. GEJIu&#13;
Wastewater Collection, Treatment and Disposal&#13;
53.   Gejiu Lake is a shallow lake, and was formned about 50 years ago through landslides&#13;
resulting from flood events at the time. Sewerage within Gejiu, a city with a population of&#13;
about 134,000, is a combined system discharging into the lake. Silt from tailing ponds&#13;
associated with tin mining and processing and runoff from deforested hillsides have added&#13;
to the problem of pollution in the lake. The water level in the lake has to be controlled to&#13;
avoid flooding within Gejiu; to prevent the adverse visual impact of low water levels. In&#13;
addition, the State Tin Corporation abstracts about 25 percent of its washwater requirements&#13;
from the lake.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
54.   The Gejiu wastewater component is designed to address the pollution of the Gejiu&#13;
Lake, which is located immediately next to the central district of Gejiu, and accessible to&#13;
large numbers of residents. Due to the substantial quantities of untreated sewage currently&#13;
discharged to the lake, it is significantly polluted and the water quality has been&#13;
progressively degraded.&#13;
55.   The component provides for the collection, treatment and disposal of the wastewater&#13;
currently discharged to the lake, together with arrangements for pumping of flood flows&#13;
during the wet season to prevent flooding of low lying areas of the city, and provisions for&#13;
restoring the water balance during drought periods to maintain water levels for reasons of&#13;
amenity and water abstraction. The wastewater system includes interceptor sewers around&#13;
the lake shore; pumping of foul sewage and flood flows, high rate biological treatment of&#13;
foul sewage, prior to discharge to a river used for irrigation purposes, and facility to sustain&#13;
water balance of the lake. The improved water quality would enhance the amenity,&#13;
recreation and land use value of the surrounding area.&#13;
56.   Proposed Component ($7.9 million). The proposed component would comprise&#13;
the following works:&#13;
(a)   Interceptor and Conveyor Sewer Systems including about 3.7 km of&#13;
sewers ranging in size from about 600 to 800 mm diameter. Pump station&#13;
with a wastewater capacity of about 40,000 m 3/d and a stormwater capacity&#13;
of about 200,000 m /d. Wastewater conveyor of about 3.9 km length in&#13;
800 mm diameter force main and gravity sewer. Stormwater force main of&#13;
about 1,000 mm diameter, length 0.5 km.&#13;
(b)   Storm Drainage System including rehabilitation of existing culvert about&#13;
2.5 km long, and construction of about 1.3 km of concrete-lined tunnel of&#13;
size about 2.2 m high * 2.2 m wide, complete with integral wastewater&#13;
culvert.&#13;
(c)   Sewage Treatment Works comprising screens, grit removal facilities, high&#13;
rate activated sludge treatment with waste sludge stabilization and disposal,&#13;
and ancillary facilities for about 25,000 m3/d capacity.&#13;
(d)   Water Balance Facilities for Gejiu Lake comprising storage tanks of total&#13;
capacity about 1.5 MM3, for controlled release to Gejiu Lake (not financed&#13;
in this project).&#13;
C. QUJING&#13;
Municipal Solid Waste Management&#13;
57.   Qujing is a newly developing industrial city located about 150 km to the northeast&#13;
of Kunming. Much of the city was built in the last 10 years as a result of economic&#13;
development in the surrounding area. Infrastructure development has not kept pace.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
Although the center of the city is clean and tidy, the peri-urban areas suffer from&#13;
indiscriminate dumping of waste. Approximately 200 tpd (between 170 and 220 tpd&#13;
depending on the season) are collected, representing roughly 80 percent of domestic waste&#13;
generated by a population of about 220,000. Authorities expect the solid waste quantities to&#13;
rise by 8 percent annually up to the year 2000 and by 5 percent up to the year 2010,&#13;
exceeding 400 tpd at the end of this period. As in Kunming, the increasing use of gas rather&#13;
than coal is moderating this projected increase somewhat in reducing the ash content of the&#13;
waste.&#13;
Overall Project Objectives&#13;
58.   The key objectives of the solid waste management programs in Qujing are:&#13;
(a)   Effective and efficient collection and disposal of domestic and industrial&#13;
solid waste, particularly in the suburban areas;&#13;
(b)   Safe disposal of hazardous wastes from industries and hospitals;&#13;
(c)   The reduction, reuse and recycling of waste;&#13;
(d)   The development of a disposal approach consisting of a system of transfer&#13;
stations and landfills;&#13;
(e)   The stabilization and closure of existing dumps; and&#13;
(f)   Improved operations and policy development through a program  of&#13;
institution building, training and developing approaches to enhanced cost&#13;
recovery for solid waste management services.&#13;
Population and Solid Waste Generation Trends&#13;
59.   From limited population trends and the growth of the sector during the early 1990s,&#13;
projections for solid waste generation in Qujing have been estimated. For the years 1991&#13;
through 1993, daily generation increased from 105 to 153 tpd. The unusually high growth&#13;
rate is primarily due to the incorporation of new areas into the Municipality of Qujing.&#13;
Based on the above growth rates, by 2000 waste generation will be 262 tpd and by 2005 it&#13;
will reach 335 tpd. The per capita generation at present is approximately 0.76 kg/d, much&#13;
of which is ash from coal burning.&#13;
Waste Compositional Trends&#13;
60.   Waste composition trends will be similar to that of Kunming in that the expected&#13;
rate of gas usage will increase to 40 percent in 2000 and to 73 percent in 2010 according to&#13;
the master plan for the city. The inorganic portion, primarily ash, will decline from 61&#13;
percent in 1995 to 20 percent by 2010. The per capita generation rate for the planning&#13;
period is expected to remain high despite the reduction of ash content, at 0.84 kg/d per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
capita. This will also have a significant impact on refuse compactability, density and&#13;
landfill requirement.&#13;
Current Management Practices&#13;
61.   Current collection and disposal practices mirror those of Kunming, the center of the&#13;
city receiving a disproportionate amount of services compared to peri-urban areas. Of the&#13;
roughly 200 tpd of waste that are collected, 45 percent is collected by the Municipality and&#13;
the rest is delivered by a combination of trucks and handcarts from institutions and&#13;
commercial establishments. The collection of this waste is funded by the generators.&#13;
Sanitation staff number some 400 which include sweepers, collection people, drivers and&#13;
management personnel. There are over 1,000 refuse cans scattered throughout the city but&#13;
primarily in central areas. In addition, some 190 specialized refuse bins and 140 handcarts&#13;
are in use. As in Kunming, the collection system is highly manual with much double&#13;
handling. The Municipality operates 11 refuse trucks, four nightsoil pumping trucks and&#13;
five general-purpose small dump trucks.&#13;
62.   Disposal remains the principal issue in Qujing. Two dump sites located at the edge&#13;
of the city are used; a composting plant built in 1992 has now ceased to operate. Another&#13;
old dump site has been walled off and formally closed with the waste in place being&#13;
composted and sorted.&#13;
Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
63.   The principal government agency responsible for municipal solid  waste&#13;
management in Qujing is the Municipal Environmental Sanitation Office. The feasibility&#13;
study for the component mentions plans to create a separate transfer and disposal company.&#13;
To date nothing has been done to move the municipality in this direction. Therefore, it is&#13;
assumed that the major responsibility for implementing this component will remain with the&#13;
Sanitation Department.&#13;
Recommended Collection Approach&#13;
64.   Based on the analysis carried out, an entirely new approach to transfer and disposal&#13;
is recommended. Collection will basically be carried out as at present, with the exception&#13;
of improved coverage in the peripheral areas of the city. Transfer and disposal will&#13;
incorporate the use of six transfer station, five in Qujing proper and one in Zhanyi to the&#13;
north, and a sanitary landfill located between the two cities.&#13;
65.   Transfer Stations. Two small transfer stations will be built, each capable of&#13;
handling approximately 60 tpd. The distances to the new landfill are 2 to 3 km for the&#13;
station located in Qujing and 3 km for the one located in Zhanyi. In 1998, for example,&#13;
some 225 tpd will be collected and of this 60 percent will go through the transfer stations,&#13;
with the remaining amount going directly to the landfill. As the generation exceeds 400 tpd&#13;
around 2010, the transfer stations will have to accommodate 100 tpd. Initially, each transfer&#13;
station will be equipped with an 8-ton (16 m3)container carrying truck used for transfer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81-                       ANNEX2&#13;
purposes and one 5-ton rear-loading truck used primarily for direct collection and&#13;
subsequent discharge at the landfill. The dump trucks should be able to complete one round&#13;
trip to the landfill per hour and therefore dispose of roughly 50 tpd.&#13;
66.   Vehicles and Containers Required.&#13;
(a)   4, 8 t (14 m3 ) container carrying trucks&#13;
(b)   9, 5 t (8 m3 ) container carrying trucks&#13;
Recommended Disposal Approach&#13;
67.   Dagou/Xiaopo Landfill. A new landfill some 6 km northwest from Qujing city&#13;
center is proposed, located in a rear valley of Xiaopo Village and Taihe Mountain. The&#13;
volume of the landfill is 1,770,000 m3, which would suffice for 15 to 17 years depending on&#13;
such factors as landfill operations and refuse composition. The site is well situated in low&#13;
mountains and is basically in a V-shaped valley with about 150 m of relief. It is rocky and&#13;
the vegetation is sparse, basically scrub. Very little of the area is used for agricultural&#13;
purposes because of its low productivity and arid conditions. The site also has significant&#13;
clay, in some places as deep as 15 m, with permeability ranging from 10-2 to 104 cm/s,&#13;
which is much less than ideal.&#13;
68.   An access road will need to be built of some 1.5 km in length and a site road of&#13;
1.2 km is also needed in order to use the site completely during its two filling phases. Two&#13;
filling phases are required because of the unusual topography and severe slopes. Each&#13;
phase will last approximately seven to eight years and require construction of a leachate&#13;
control and landfill stabilization dam so that refuse can be worked on a horizontal surface.&#13;
A water control ditch will also be built around the site to catch and discharge runoff before&#13;
it has a chance to penetrate the fill.&#13;
69.   In order to control leachate, grouting methods will be applied and a synthetic liner&#13;
used. A leachate collection system similar to that being applied in the Kunming landfills&#13;
would be provided. There will be no direct treatment of leachate but a storage basin of&#13;
7,500 m3 capacity would be provided. Leachate would be recirculated through the landfill&#13;
or piped to a nearby wastewater treatment plant. Based on the current wastewater flow at&#13;
the treatrnent plant, the leachate would increase the flow only between 2 and 4 percent.&#13;
70.   A gas collection system is also being proposed to work in tandem with the leachate&#13;
collection system. The gas will be flared.&#13;
71.   Proposed Component ($4.5 million). The proposed component would comprise&#13;
the following works:&#13;
(a)    Dagou/Xiaopo Landfill comprising site preparation and construction of a&#13;
new landfill with capacity of about 1.8 Mm3 at a site some 6 km to the&#13;
northwest of the city, including leachate and gas collection/treatment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
systems, site facilities and operational vehicles and plant, access and site&#13;
roads.&#13;
(b)   Transfer Stations. Construction of two transfer stations throughout the&#13;
city.&#13;
(c)   Collection and Transportation Vehicles.  Procurement of about 13&#13;
collection and transportation vehicles in sizes between 5 and 8 tons capacity.&#13;
(d)   Institutional Development and Training.  Provision of institutional&#13;
development and practical training for both management and operational&#13;
personnel, with particular attention being given to the control, management&#13;
and monitoring necessary to effectively operate sanitary landfill operations.&#13;
Wastewater Collection, Treatment and Disposal&#13;
72.   The primary objective of wastewater treatment for the city of Qujing is the&#13;
improvement of water quality in the Nanpanjiang, the quality of which is currently Class V.&#13;
The considerable variation in river flows means that dilution may be limited, and the longer&#13;
term objective is to provide secondary treatment of wastewater. The project will provide an&#13;
intermediate stage biological treatment, which can readily be incorporated in the longer&#13;
term facilities. Wastewater flows from the developed eastern and northern areas of the city,&#13;
will be intercepted and conveyed to the treatment site which is located to the south of&#13;
Qujing in the vicinity of the junction of the Baishi and Xiaoxianghe rivers. The trunk sewer&#13;
system and treatment facilities would be expanded in the future to accommodate the&#13;
wastewater flows from the western area of Qujing, which is expected to develop during the&#13;
next IO to 15 years.&#13;
73.   Proposed Component ($15.0 million). The proposed component would comprise&#13;
the following works:&#13;
(a)   Trunk Collector Sewer Systems including the construction of about&#13;
12.1 km of sewers in sizes between 300 and 1,800 mm diameter, including&#13;
sewer connections and related structures for interception of wastewater&#13;
flows from existing combined sewer systems and surface drainage channels.&#13;
(b)   Sewage Treatment Works comprising screens, pumping, grit removal,&#13;
intermediate biological treatment, sludge treatment and disposal, and&#13;
ancillary facilities, with capacity of about 80,000 m3/d.&#13;
(c)   Maintenance Depots, Sewer Cleaning and Safety Equipment for use&#13;
throughout the city, including bucket cleaning equipment, hoists,&#13;
transportation, and safety equipment to be based at maintenance depot at&#13;
STW site.&#13;
&#13;

Water Supply&#13;
74.   Existing Situation. The combined population of Qujing and the satellite town of&#13;
Zhanyi (10 km to the north), was around 162,000 in 1992. This figure is projected to reach&#13;
437,000 and 452,000 in years 2010 and 2020, respectively. Average water demands are&#13;
estimated at about 66,500 m3/d in 1995, rising to 132,000 m3/d in 2010 and 153,000 m3/d in&#13;
2020. Peak values are estimated at 152,000 and 176,000 in years 2010 and 2020&#13;
respectively. Existing supplies, totaling 87,000 m3/d are obtained from Xiaoxiang, Xihe&#13;
and Niuguohe reservoir sources; however, the reliability of these sources is reported very&#13;
low in the range 35 to 45 percent. The installed treatment capacity at the existing three&#13;
works is reported around 81,000 m3/d. However, deficiencies in the existing distribution&#13;
system reduce the effective daily supply to around 55,000 m3/d.&#13;
75.   The proposed component in this project would: (a) provide improved distribution&#13;
pipework in the existing northern and eastern areas of the city to ensure distribution of the&#13;
full available supply of treated water from the existing works; and (b) address the apparent&#13;
supply deficiency by developing a new water scheme from the existing DuMu reservoir&#13;
which is located some 40 km to the northwest from Qujing. The DuMu source was selected&#13;
as the least-cost scheme to provide a reliable supply for the long term development of&#13;
Qujing, providing a safe yield (at 95 percent reliability) of 120,000 m3/d, which would&#13;
suffice to meet the peak demand through year 2020. The scheme would be developed in&#13;
two stages each of 60,000 m3/d capacity, the raw water main would be sized for the first&#13;
stage development and a duplicate pipe would be provided at a later date, since this is the&#13;
least-cost option for this pipeline (although the tunnel would be built for the full&#13;
development).&#13;
76.   Proposed Component ($21.2 million). The proposed component would comprise&#13;
the following works:&#13;
(a)   Distribution System Strengthening comprising pressure pipelines of steel,&#13;
ductile iron, or prestressed concrete materials, in sizes between 200 and&#13;
600 mm diameter, of about 19 km total length in the northern and eastern&#13;
areas of the city.&#13;
(b)   Raw  Water Transmission Pipeline comprising pressure pipeline of&#13;
prestressed concrete, steel, or other materials, about 1,000 mm diameter,&#13;
control valves and facilities, of about 34.1 km total length from DuMu&#13;
reservoir to Qujing, No.1 and No.2 WTP.&#13;
(c)   Extension of Water Treatment Plant No.2 at North Qujing comprising&#13;
flocculation, clarification, filtration, chlorination, storage, pumping and&#13;
ancillary facilities, of about 30,000 m3/d additional capacity.&#13;
(d)   Raw Water Transmission Tunnel. Horseshoe-shape pressure tunnel of&#13;
size about 2.0 m high * 2.0 m wide with reinforced concrete or spray&#13;
concrete lining, of about 9.3 km length.&#13;
&#13;

D. INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION CONTROL&#13;
77.   The proposals for the Kunyang Phosphorus Fertilizer Factory comprise a&#13;
combination of process upgrading and wastewater treatment. The process upgrading will&#13;
permit production of higher grade products and will achieve improved water and materials&#13;
utilization. The reduced wastewater flow will be given treatment in the form of chemical&#13;
precipitation of phosphate to meet the standard for discharge to Dianchi Lake, which&#13;
requires a phosphorus concentration of not more than I mg/l in the treated wastewater. The&#13;
combined effect of the process upgrading and wastewater treatment proposals in an overall&#13;
reduction in the phosphorus load discharged to Dianchi Lake from 57 tons/year to less than&#13;
I ton/year, a reduction of about 98 percent. The wastewater discharge will be reduced from&#13;
540 m3/h to 117 m3/h.&#13;
78.   The proposals for the Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Factory are also based on a&#13;
combination of process upgrading and wastewater treatment. The process upgrading&#13;
proposals involve improvements in water recycling, recovery of ammonia and phosphate&#13;
chemicals and in desulfurization of the coal gas (produced on site by coal carbonization)&#13;
used in ammonia-based product manufacture. A new sulfuric acid plant using sulfur as raw&#13;
material is proposed to enhance phosphoric production, which is currently only internittent,&#13;
which causes high losses during startup and shutdown. The process improvements will&#13;
reduce wastewater discharges from 550 to 59 m3/h (ca 90 percent) and loads of ammonia&#13;
(as N) from 332 to 85 tons/year (about 75 percent) and phosphorus from 36 to 4 tons/year&#13;
(about 90 percent). Wastewater treatment will reduce these loads further to 10.6 tons/year&#13;
and 0.4 tons/year for ammonia (as N) and phosphorus respectively.&#13;
79.   Proposed Component ($34.1 million). The proposed component would comprise&#13;
the following works:&#13;
Kunyang Phosphorus Fertilizer Factory&#13;
(a)   a new 60,000 tons/year sulfuric acid production facility, which will enhance&#13;
production of downstream products and will allow a change from sulfide ore&#13;

ANNEX 6: LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
ACTION PLAN&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The implementation of the Yunnan Environment Project (YEP) entails land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement/rehabilitation of affected persons.  In order to facilitate&#13;
mitigation of the adverse land acquisition related impacts of the project, YEPO has prepared&#13;
a Resettlement Action Plan.&#13;
2.    The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for YEP covers project components located in&#13;
the cities of Kunming, Qujing and Gejiu; and in several sites in the Dianchi Basin. This&#13;
annex describes the likely land acquisition and resettlement impacts of YEP and discusses&#13;
the framework developed by the Provincial and Municipal Governnents for implementing&#13;
and financing land acquisition and resettlement activities. Section B describes the impacts&#13;
of the project and the surveys carried out to measure them. Section C sets out the&#13;
implementation framework for Land Acquisition and Resettlement (LAR).  YEP&#13;
implementation would commence in 1996 and continue to 2001.&#13;
B. PROJECT IMPACTS&#13;
3.    The following project components would require land acquisition and/or&#13;
resettlement/rehabilitation of affected persons:&#13;
Provincewide&#13;
(a)   Environmental Management and Monitoring Project;&#13;
Kunming City&#13;
(b)   Sewage Treatment Works Number 1;&#13;
(c)   Sewage Treatment Works Number 4;&#13;
(d)   Sewage Treatment Works Number 5 (East);&#13;
(e)   West Suburban Sewer Networks;&#13;
(f)    Municipal Sewer Networks;&#13;
(g)   Municipal Water Supply;&#13;
(h)   Municipal Solid Waste;&#13;

(m)   Urban Sewage Treatment;&#13;
(n)   Urban Solid Waste;&#13;
(o)   Urban Water Supply; and&#13;
Gejiu&#13;
(p)   Urban Sewage Treatment.&#13;
4.    Construction of these project components requires land acquisition, together with&#13;
the rehabilitation and/or resettlement of the affected persons. In order to determine the&#13;
impact of project components on the affected people and property each implementing&#13;
agency decided to conduct a census survey of affected persons and properties and to collect&#13;
socioeconomic data.&#13;
Census Survey&#13;
5.    A Census Survey has been carried out in stages commencing in July 1995 in&#13;
collaboration with the local governments. The detailed surveys are progressively updated&#13;
as the technical designs are finalized. The data set out here represent the situation by&#13;
March 29, 1996. Most of the project components have been approved to the Feasibility&#13;
Study Stage. The Feasibility Study usually sets the broad parameters for land acquisition,&#13;
following which the implementing agencies can notify the affected townships, and the&#13;
detailed census of affected persons and properties can begin. There would be small changes&#13;
as the Design Studies for project components are completed and approved. Since some&#13;
census surveys have still to be finalized in sites for which boundaries have been recently&#13;
changed, some figures presented here may be subject to minor change.&#13;
6.    Preliminary impacts are summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   The total amount of land to be acquired is 215 hectares. Most of the sites&#13;
are greenfield sites on the urban fringes;&#13;
(b)   About 100 hectares of land would be borrowed temporarily during&#13;
construction;&#13;
(c)   No houses need to be relocated;&#13;
(d)   A total of 3,090 persons are affected by land acquisition;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
(e)   Most of the affected persons can be reabsorbed back into agriculture through&#13;
land redistribution, but 890 people (including dependents) would need to be&#13;
provided with nonagricultural, enterprise jobs. The latter group will be&#13;
offered a choice between jobs in enterprises, or cash compensation in lieu of&#13;
jobs. All workers, regardless of age, will be offered cash compensation at&#13;
the rate needed to maintain incomes;&#13;
(f)   The project will affect about 70 workers in 4 enterprises until enterprise&#13;
production facilities are reconstructed.&#13;
7.    Preliminary socioeconomic data regarding the affected persons are being collected&#13;
by the implementing agencies. Before each contract is initiated an appointed institution&#13;
would conduct detailed baseline socioeconomic surveys of the affected people in each&#13;
contract.  This work would be completed before initiation of land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement activities for each project component. The baseline survey would measure the&#13;
income levels and standards of living of the affected persons before land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement. This baseline survey would form the basis for comparing their income levels&#13;
and standards of living as reported by the monitoring reports during project implementation.&#13;
Minimization of Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
8.    Most of the Feasibility Studies included an analysis of land acquisition and possible&#13;
resettlement, as part of the identification of project options. While the selection between&#13;
options was based on technical and economic criteria, the potential impact on project&#13;
affected persons was also considered. For example, the Kunming Water Supply and Solid&#13;
Waste projects have endeavored to select sites further from concentrated populations that&#13;
minimize disruption to communities. The Maliohe Reservoir Xiyuan Tunnel Stage 2&#13;
project component would have inundated three villages and relocated some 1,500 people.&#13;
The YEP has excluded this project component on technical, economical and social grounds.&#13;
After careful review the number of people requiring relocation of housing has been reduced&#13;
to zero.&#13;
C. FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF LAND ACQUISITION AND&#13;
RESETTLEMENT ACTIVITIES&#13;
9.    The RAP describes the framework for implementing the land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement program. The framework comprises the following elements:&#13;
(a)   Objectives and principles of land compensation and resettlement;&#13;
(b)   Legal framework and resettlement policies;&#13;
(c)   Provisions for job creation&#13;
(d)   Resettlement Institutions and Agencies&#13;

(g)   Participation and consultation with affected persons&#13;
(h)   Redressal of grievance and appeals process&#13;
(i)    Monitoring and evaluation of RAP implementation.&#13;
10.   The RAP, covering the above components of resettlement implementation&#13;
framework, has been prepared by YEPO based on discussions with the concerned levels of&#13;
government; the resulting RAP has been approved by the concerned provincial and&#13;
municipal authorities, and would be implemented as an integral part of the YEP. The&#13;
components of the frarnework for implementation are described below.&#13;
Objectives and Principles of Resettlement&#13;
11.   The main objective of the land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) is to ensure that&#13;
the standards of living and income levels of all categories of affected persons are improved,&#13;
or at least restored, after resettlement. The main principles for implementing the LAR&#13;
program are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Minimize land acquisition and resettlement as much as possible through&#13;
choice of project components and changes in design and alignment;&#13;
(b)   Pay compensation for all structures at the replacement value of those&#13;
structures;&#13;
(c)   Pay compensation for collective land to the local collective.  This&#13;
compensation would be used to increase the productive capacity of the&#13;
collectives and would not be used for any other purpose.&#13;
(d)   Agencies will arrange jobs in nonagricultural enterprises for persons whose&#13;
lands are acquired and who are left with less than the economic per capita&#13;
landholding, to ensure that their income levels and standard of living are at&#13;
least restored, or improved.&#13;
(e)   All the civic facilities, such as municipal roads, communication, lighting,&#13;
sewerage, treatment work, etc. will be restored at the new locations. The&#13;
YEP will fully compensate for transfer and reconstruction at replacement&#13;
cost.&#13;
(f)    The YEP will reconstruct all affected enterprises at nearby locations at the&#13;
same standard as before.&#13;

(g)   The YEP will compensate and resettle persons affected by temporary land&#13;
borrow to restore their standards of living.&#13;
(h)   YEP agencies will plan and implement land acquisition and resettlement&#13;
activities with the participation of affected persons and their representatives.&#13;
(i)    The affected persons or enterprises have avenues for redress of their&#13;
grievances and if they are not satisfied with the outcome, they can appeal to&#13;
higher authority and to civil courts.&#13;
12.   The situation of persons whose lands are affected has been reviewed by YEPO and&#13;
the implementing agencies.  They would be offered a choice between jobs in&#13;
nonagricultural enterprises and self-employment with a cash compensation payment. The&#13;
cost ranges from Y 13,000 to Y 15,000 in Kunming and is Y 10,000 in Qujing and Gejiu&#13;
and will be finalized taking into account the labor market situation and income cost from&#13;
farming. Those opting for jobs would be paid a transition allowance until jobs are provided.&#13;
In addition to income restoration for older people at the same rates, special rehabilitation&#13;
measures will be taken to ensure that elderly affected persons are able to maintain their&#13;
standards of living. The YEP implementing agencies will raise these rates if they are not&#13;
sufficient to maintain standards of living.&#13;
13.   The following guidelines and principles would be followed:&#13;
(a)   New houses of the affected persons would be of at least the same standard as&#13;
the affected houses or equal to the minimum current standard, whichever is&#13;
the greater;&#13;
(b)   All civic infrastructure would be replaced at project cost;&#13;
(c)   All affected enterprises would be assisted to resume operations at nearby&#13;
locations provided by the local governments;&#13;
(d)   Workers would be provided with allowances equivalent to their salaries for&#13;
the period of closure of their enterprises; and&#13;
(e)   Planning and implementation of the LAR program would be carried out with&#13;

would compensate for temporary land leasing at the rate of up to&#13;
Y 10,000 mu 'for a period of half to one year, based on gross agricultural&#13;
output value of the land.  With this compensation local township&#13;
governments would arrange the economic rehabilitation of persons affected&#13;
temporarily;&#13;
(c)   Loss of Housing. Persons losing government owned or private apartments&#13;
and houses in Kunming, Qujing and Gejiu would have the options of:&#13;
(i)    moving into a community-built house of the same standard as&#13;
previous house, without any extra payment; and&#13;
(ii)   self-constructing a house upon payment of compensation at&#13;
replacement value for the affected house or structure. No deductions&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-117 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
19.   The RAP provides full details of housing allocation and reconstruction options, as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   Partial Impacts on Structures.  Borrower agencies would pay full&#13;
replacement value as compensation;&#13;
(b)   Impact on Enterprises. Land Departments would, in consultation with&#13;
local governments, allocate alternative plots to affected enterprises.&#13;
Borrower agencies would compensate enterprises at replacement rates for&#13;
affected buildings, structures and other fixtures and furnishings. They&#13;
would pay the full cost of transfer of facilities. They would compensate&#13;
affected workers in lieu of salaries at rates equivalent to the monthly salaries&#13;
of the workers.  They would compensate affected TVE and private&#13;
enterprises for net losses in production during the period when production is&#13;
stopped;&#13;
(c)   Shops and Small Businesses. Land Departments, in consultation with local&#13;
governments, would provide such businesses with alternative plots for&#13;
continuing their businesses. Borrower agencies would compensate such&#13;
businesses for the net losses in income during the period when their business&#13;
is closed;&#13;
(d)   Temporarily Affected Enterprises. Borrower agencies would compensate&#13;
such enterprises at replacement value with regard to special features of&#13;
construction. No deduction would be made for depreciation. Arrangements&#13;
would be made to provide temporary alternative sites to affected enterprises.&#13;
Staff would be compensated for loss of salary and production losses would&#13;
be compensated;&#13;
(e)   Loss Of Employment In Agriculture.  All farmers forced out of&#13;
agriculture by land acquisition would be given the option of self-&#13;
employment or jobs in  nonagricultural enterprises.   The project&#13;
implementing agencies would pay an amount of Y 13,000-15,000/ person to&#13;
the enterprises for providing jobs to affected persons. During the relocation&#13;
period they would pay workers Y 150/month as a subsistence allowance. In&#13;
case the affected persons do not receive jobs within three months from the&#13;
date of land acquisition, the borrower agencies would provide temporary&#13;
jobs to them until they can be provided jobs in enterprises. In case the&#13;
affected persons want to opt for self-employment, they would be provided&#13;
with the same amount in lieu of jobs in enterprises. Affected persons above&#13;
age of 50 years would be eligible for income restoration at the same rate. In&#13;
addition to this, specific measures would be taken by the borrower agencies&#13;
and the local governments to ensure that the standards of living of the&#13;
elderly persons are restored after relocation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-118 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
(f)   Temporary Loss Of Employment In Agriculture.  The borrower&#13;
implementing agencies would pay the respective township governments up&#13;
to Y 10,000 per mu of land affected by temporary land borrow. With the&#13;
help of this compensation amount, the local governments would plan&#13;
rehabilitation activities for affected persons.   Upon completion of&#13;
construction, the borrower agencies would return the land to the local&#13;
township after restoring it to its original condition;&#13;
(g)   Impact On Public Infrastructure And Other Assets.  All civic&#13;
infrastructure would be compensated at replacement rates without any&#13;
deduction for depreciation. The infrastructure would be reconstructed by the&#13;
respective departments;&#13;
(h)   Loss Of Standing Crops. Standing crops compensation would be paid&#13;
directly to the affected farmers at the full market value of affected crops;&#13;
(i)   Indirect Impacts In The Disturbance Zone. Indirect impacts, if any, due&#13;
to the construction of the project, on structures in the disturbance zone&#13;
would be compensated for at the full replacement rates. Structures needing&#13;
repairs would be compensated fully for the repairs. If any houses need to be&#13;
relocated due to such impact, they would be treated on the same lines as&#13;
houses affected by permanent land acquisition; and&#13;
(j)    Relocating households would be paid at full replacement values.&#13;
20.  In case it were found that the standards of living of any category of affected persons&#13;
have not been restored after relocation or resettlement, the borrower implementing agency&#13;
would be responsible to take additional measures to ensure that the main objective of the&#13;
RAP is to be achieved.&#13;
Job Creation&#13;
21.   All of the persons forced out of agriculture by land acquisition would be provided&#13;
with jobs in nonagricultural enterprises or have the option of self-employment. The number&#13;
of persons to be provided jobs is calculated on the basis of maintaining the average per&#13;
capita land holding in Yunnan Province and other involved cities. Out of the 3,090 affected&#13;
persons, some 890 are eligible for new employment. This includes those older workers who&#13;
will be offered income restoration at the cash compensation rate for self-employment. Jobs&#13;
to the eligible persons would be provided through one of the following methods:&#13;
(a)   Provide jobs in state enterprises;&#13;
(b)   Provide jobs in collective (township and village) enterprises;&#13;
(c)   Private enterprises; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-119 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
(d)   Self-employment&#13;
22.   Job creation is the responsibility of the borrower implementing agencies assisted by&#13;
the Yunnan Provincial and other Cities Land Management Bureau, and the Labor Bureau at&#13;
various levels. Arrangements to provide jobs to eligible labor are necessary before the&#13;
Construction Land Use Certificate is issued by the planning and land administrative&#13;
departments in each project city. The borrower implementing agencies would pay a sum to&#13;
be determined per worker to township enterprises and a sum to be determined per worker to&#13;
other enterprises for job creation. In case the affected person opts for self-employment&#13;
he/she would be paid a resettlement subsidy of a minimum of sum to be determined and an&#13;
additional sum to be determined for each additional year.&#13;
23.   Jobs should be provided within one month of signing the agreement for land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement between borrowers and the Local Land Acquisition Bureau.&#13;
However, if they jobs are not provided within three months of land acquisition, borrower&#13;
agencies would provide temporary jobs to affected persons until enterprise jobs can be&#13;
provided. The wage level for the temporary jobs would be at least equivalent to the&#13;
minimum wage level in the municipality/county. They would pay a monthly subsistence&#13;
allowance to each eligible worker for a period of three months. The names of enterprises&#13;
that would provide jobs are set out in the RAP.&#13;
24.   The persons eligible for job creation would be trained in specific skills before they&#13;
are employed on the job. The training would be provided by agencies to be determined.&#13;
Out of the resettlement subsidy to be paid to enterprises Y 200/worker would be reserved&#13;
especially for training.&#13;
Resettlement Institutions and Agencies&#13;
25.   The Yunnan Provincial Government (YPG) has vested overall responsibility for&#13;
coordination of planning and implementation of resettlement activities with YEPO. YEPO&#13;
and the Municipal project offices in Kunming, Qujing and Gejiu are responsible for&#13;
coordinating resettlement activities.  The actual planning and implementation of&#13;
resettlement would be carried out by the borrower implementing agencies together with&#13;
local land administration departments, township and village governments. Apart from&#13;
these, the main departments, bureaus and agencies responsible for various aspects of LAR&#13;
planning, implementing, coordinating and monitoring resettlement activities are the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)   The Planning Administration Office in each project city;&#13;
(b)   The Yunnan Provincial and Municipal Land Administration Bureau for&#13;
Kunming, Qujing and Gejiu;&#13;
(c)   The Labor Bureau for Kunming, Qujing and Gejiu; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-120 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
(d)   Research Institute of Foreign Capital Introduction and Utilization,&#13;
Southwest Communication University (Monitoring and Evaluation Agency).&#13;
26.  In addition to the above, YEPO would convene a Land Acquisition and&#13;
Resettlement (LAR) Group with members from all involved agencies. This group would&#13;
meet every four months throughout resettlement implementation to resolve coordination&#13;
issues.&#13;
27.   Staff of YEPO have attended the Resettlement Training Program organized by the&#13;
World Bank at Nanjing in April 1995. The staff who received training at Nanjing have&#13;
been conducting inhouse training programs in YEPO and other project offices. Officials of&#13;
key departments of YPG also attended the regular discussions and seminars with YEPO&#13;
officials. YEPO would organize a training program at times to be determined throughout&#13;
resettlement implementation.&#13;
Costs and Budget&#13;
28.   The costs of RAP implementation would be a part of the overall budget of the YEP.&#13;
The annual requirement of funds would be included in the annual investment plan for the&#13;
project. The base cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated to be approximately&#13;
Y 156 million. The detailed cost estimates (shown annually) would be provided. Each&#13;
borrower implementing agency would pay the funds for RAP implementation to the&#13;
respective labor and land administration departments, state and collective enterprises and&#13;
public utility companies. They would spend the funds based on the specific provisions of&#13;
the RAP.&#13;
29.   Borrower agencies would pay 4 percent of the total LAR cost to cover the&#13;
administrative expenses to the Land Administration Departments responsible for&#13;
implementing LAR agreements. The cost estimates would be adjusted annually based on&#13;
the actual inflation rate for the past year. Physical contingencies of 15 percent of the cost&#13;
estimates would also be budgeted. Each borrower implementing agency is responsible for&#13;
provision of adequate funds to carry out RAP implementation. Cost overruns, if any, would&#13;
be incurred by each such agency.&#13;
Implementation of Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
30.   There would be 16 separate contracts with separate "startup" dates of construction&#13;
ranging from July 1996. The land acquisition and resettlement activities would be specified&#13;
in detail in the RAP. On any given contract RAP activities should be completed at least one&#13;
month before the proposed date of start of construction on that contract.  Each&#13;
implementing agency would certify before the start of any given contract that the LAR&#13;
activities on that contract have been completed. Annex 8 sets out the proposed startup and&#13;
completion dates for the various contracts. A "Generic Implementation Schedule" has been&#13;
prepared based on the estimated time likely to be taken for each activity under the LAR&#13;
program. This can be used to arrive at the specific dates of completion of the various land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-121-                        ANNEX6&#13;
acquisition and resettlement activities in any contract by providing the proposed startup date&#13;
for resettlement activities.&#13;
Participation and Consultations&#13;
31.   The LAR program has been designed with the active involvement of affected&#13;
persons and their representatives. The affected persons are informed about the project after&#13;
the Feasibility Study is approved by the Municipal and Provincial Planning Commissions.&#13;
The affected persons and their representatives participated in the census surveys carried out&#13;
by each implementing agency and project office. A notice of LAR would be given to each&#13;
affected household after the project is approved by the Bank/IDA. The borrower agencies,&#13;
assisted by local government, would inform the affected persons and households about the&#13;
project, the proposed resettlement and the specific entitlements of each affected household.&#13;
Each borrower agency would also locate a field office, easily accessible to the affected&#13;
persons, within the affected area, in order to provide information to affected persons and&#13;
resolve their grievances. The affected persons would participate in the following activities:&#13;
(a)    Select specific resettlement locations for residential sites and for enterprises;&#13;
(b)   Construct their own houses (depending on their option);&#13;
(c)    Transfer their assets to the new houses;&#13;
(d)    Select enterprises for jobs;&#13;
(e)    Exercise the option of self-employment; and&#13;
(f)    Manage implementation of the LAR  program  through their village,&#13;
township representatives.&#13;
Resettlement Information Booklet&#13;
32.   Resettlement Information Booklets are being prepared for each affected site. The&#13;
booklets will have a common section with overall regulations and principles and a section&#13;
laying out the resettlement arrangements specific to each affected area. The wide variation&#13;
among cities leads to different solutions in several cases. The booklet will be given to each&#13;
affected person, ensuring their knowledge of their rights under the project, and avenues of&#13;
appeal of their rights, are respected.&#13;
Redressal of Grievances and the Appeals Process&#13;
33.   In order to ensure that the affected persons have avenues for redressing their&#13;
grievances, detailed procedures for redressal of grievances would be established. This&#13;
procedure is likely to comprise certain stages. First, the affected person could lodge a&#13;
grievance with the local township Land Management Bureau, to which the Bureau should&#13;
respond within 15 days. Second, in case the person is not satisfied, an appeal could be&#13;
made to a department within the District Government within a specified time frame from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-122 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
the date of response from the Land Management Bureau at township level. Third, if still&#13;
unsatisfied, the affected person could appeal to a department within the Municipal&#13;
Government for redressing the grievance. Finally, if still unsatisfied, an appeal can be&#13;
lodged with the People's Court within 15 days of receiving the decision from Municipal&#13;
level. For grievances related to job provision, the respective Labor Bureau at the various&#13;
levels would be the appropriate authorities. The grievance could be for any aspect of the&#13;
RAP program, including rates of compensation. Grievance mechanisms would be widely&#13;
publicized among the affected persons.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
34.   In order to ensure that the implementation of the LAR program would be carried out&#13;
in accordance with the provisions of the RAP, detailed monitoring and evaluation, both&#13;
intemal and external, would be carried out, both during and after implementation of the&#13;
project.&#13;
(a)   Internal Monitoring. Each borrower agency would be responsible for&#13;
internal monitoring of the LAR program. This would be coordinated by&#13;
YEPO. Monitoring would be carried out based on the provisions of the&#13;
RAP. The main indicators to be monitored are payment of compensation,&#13;
allotment of housing in accordance with the options exercised, provision of&#13;
jobs or alternative agricultural land, restoration of public facilities, payment&#13;
of self-employment subsidy and restoration of production activities of&#13;
enterprises. The internal monitoring reports would be prepared every six&#13;
months. Preliminary monitoring formats have been prepared and would be&#13;
provided as an annex to the RAP. Internal monitoring would be carried out&#13;
on a quarterly basis and an internal monitoring report would be submitted to&#13;
the Bank/IDA every six months. The first internal monitoring report will be&#13;
submitted on December 31, 1996. The report would be discussed in the next&#13;
meeting of LAR Group which would also recommend detailed follow-up&#13;
measures.&#13;
(b)   External Monitoring. An independent agency would be contracted to&#13;
conduct extemal monitoring and evaluation of the LAR program. In&#13;
addition to verifying the results of the internal monitoring reports, this&#13;
institute would monitor the following qualitative indicators: (i) timeliness&#13;
and adequacy of compensation payments; (ii) the linkage of land acquisition&#13;
and resettlement; (iii) timely provision of appropriate jobs or altemative&#13;
agricultural land; (iv) adequate restoration of civic infrastructure;&#13;
(v) relocation of enterprises in accordance with the policy provisions&#13;
contained in the RAP; (vi) provision of altemative housing in accordance&#13;
with the option exercised and in a timely manner; (vii) levels of satisfaction&#13;
among the affected persons; (viii) standards of living after relocation. In&#13;
order to measure the standards of living after resettlement, this institute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-123 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
would conduct another socioeconomic survey of the resettled persons about&#13;
one year after project completion.&#13;
35.   The methodology for carrying out extemal monitoring and evaluation has been&#13;
described in the RAP. The selected extemal monitoring institute would maintain a data&#13;
base with files on each affected household, which would be updated based on information&#13;
collected in successive rounds of monitoring. The Monitoring and Evaluation Report&#13;
would be prepared by this institute every six months, until construction of all subprojects is&#13;
completed. The first external monitoring report will be submitted to the Bank/IDA on&#13;
February 28, 1997. The report would be discussed in the next meeting of LAR group and&#13;
specific follow-up measures would be initiated by the LAR group. The report would&#13;
review the adequacy of implementation measures and report on the perceptions of the&#13;
affected persons. It would also identify critical issues in implementation and make&#13;
recommendations to improve overall effectiveness of the resettlement program. The report&#13;
would also report progress of follow-up in initiated by YEPO/LAR group and the borrower&#13;
implementing agencies on the recommendations of the previous monitoring reports.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 7: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Yunnan Province is located in the southwest of China and is bordered to the north&#13;
by Sichuan Province, to the east by Guizhou and Guangxi Provinces and to the south and&#13;
west by Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Myanmar. The province has a total land area of&#13;
394,000 km2 and a population of 38 million, which is largely rural, some 81 percent being&#13;
involved in agriculture. The provincial capital and major industrial center, Kunming, is&#13;
by far the largest city (population 1.2 million) and dominates the economy of the&#13;
province. The next largest cities, also significant industrial centers, are Qujing and Gejiu,&#13;
with populations of 161,500 and 134,000, respectively.&#13;
2.    The northwest of the province is dominated by the southeastern Himalayas and&#13;
includes the sources of three major rivers, the Jingshajiang (which discharges to the&#13;
Changjiang (Yangtze), the Lancangjiang (Mekong) and the Nujiang (Salween). The&#13;
northeast area includes the source of the Nanpanjiang (Pearl River). The south of the&#13;
province is tropical and the central and eastern areas comprise a plateau and fertile lake&#13;
basins at an elevation of about 2,000 m.&#13;
3.    Rapid economic growth over the past 15 years has resulted in severe&#13;
environmental degradation in and around urban centers and even in some rural areas. The&#13;
environment in many areas in the province is under severe stress. The principal cause of&#13;
degradation of the water environment in urban areas is the lack of effective control of&#13;
polluting discharges to watercourses. The situation is exacerbated by the substantial&#13;
underpricing of water and environmental services such as wastewater disposal, which&#13;
leads to wasteful consumption and hence pressure on water resources.&#13;
4.    This is particularly the case in the Dianchi Lake basin, which includes Kunming,&#13;
where water resources are particularly limited and are threatened in terns both of water&#13;
quality and quantity. The Dianchi Lake receives discharges of municipal and industrial&#13;
wastewater from Kunming and its suburbs. However, the water resources of the Dianchi&#13;
Lake basin are very limited, per capita runoff being of the order of 5 percent of the&#13;
Yunnan and 3 percent of the world averages. As a consequence of the inadequate water&#13;
resources for Kunming, the lake provides up to 50 percent of the City's water supplies&#13;
even in an average year. Further increases in demand will result in even more reliance on&#13;
the lake for supplies of potable water.&#13;
5.    The repeated recycling of wastewater, consequent upon the use of the lake as a&#13;
major contribution to the Kunming water supply, has resulted in substantial increases in&#13;
the loads of nutrients, principally nitrogen and phosphorus, discharged to the lake. The&#13;
situation is exacerbated by the presence of a number of nitrogen and phosphorus-based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-125 -                      ANNEX7&#13;
fertilizer plants in the basin, exploiting the local phosphate-based mineral resources. The&#13;
lake receives discharges of nutrient-rich wastewater from these plants and also runoff&#13;
from agricultural areas in its catchment. As a result of the high nutrient loads, the&#13;
Dianchi Lake is already in an advanced state of eutrophication, having reached a&#13;
hypertrophic state. This has caused serious deterioration in water quality, which is&#13;
manifested in part in major problems in water treatment in Kunming, resulting in intake&#13;
closure and the introduction of more extensive water treatment processes.&#13;
6.    Growth in the other urban centers of Yunnan, principally Qujing and Gejiu,&#13;
coupled with inadequate control of polluting discharges, is causing similar problems of&#13;
water quality and pressure on limited water resources. A major environmental master&#13;
plan study for the Dianchi Basin, Qujing and Gejiu, funded by the UK Overseas&#13;
Development Administration (ODA) was completed in 1996. This study has identified a&#13;
set of major priority investments aimed at rehabilitation of water quality, principally in&#13;
Dianchi Lake, and improving the effectiveness of water resource utilization and wastes&#13;
management.&#13;
7.    In order to address the above concerns the proposed project would focus on&#13;
improving the state of the environment, principally in terms of water quality, via a range&#13;
of investments with the objectives of:&#13;
(a)   improving water quality, mainly in Dianchi Lake, and water resources&#13;
management to allow sustained safe beneficial use for public water supply;&#13;
(b)   improving standards of municipal wastes management;&#13;
(c)   institution of measures to strengthen control of industrial pollution and to&#13;
improve water and materials utilization;&#13;
(d)   enhancing facilities for the effective monitoring of environmental quality&#13;
in Yunnan; and&#13;
(e)   strengthening of policies and institutional arrangements for water quality&#13;
management, water and wastewater facilities operations, environmental&#13;
regulation and management training.&#13;
8.    Technical support and training would be provided to utility and environment&#13;
sector agencies in Yunnan at provincial and municipal levels, including environmental&#13;
protection bureaus (EPBs) and monitoring centers, municipal utility operations and&#13;
finance departments.&#13;
Administrative and Institutional Framework&#13;
9.    The State Environmental Protection Committee (SEPC) is the highest level of&#13;
authority on environmental policy and includes the State Council and heads of all&#13;
relevant ministries and agencies. The national Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-126 -                     ANNEX7&#13;
functions as the secretariat of SEPC and is responsible for all aspects of environmental&#13;
policy although shares authority with other agencies for certain natural resources. NEPA&#13;
sets overall policies and regulations governing the provincial and municipal EPBs and&#13;
implementation of environmental policy is through the municipal and provincial EPBs,&#13;
who are responsible for the maintenance of enviromnental quality.&#13;
10.   Specific responsibility for water resources in Yunnan lies with the Yunnan Water&#13;
Conservancy Bureau, and with the Kunming Water Conservancy Bureau for the resources&#13;
of the Dianchi Lake basin. Maintenance of water quality is the responsibility of the&#13;
Yunnan EPB and that in the Dianchi Lake basin of the Kunming and other municipal&#13;
EPBs. These bureaus monitor environmental quality, set environmental and discharge&#13;
standards, assess and levy pollution charges and prosecute serious polluters.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
11.   The proposed project comprises a total of five core components as follows:&#13;
(a)   Lake Dianchi Basin Water Quality Recovery.  Investments would&#13;
support the Dianchi Environmental Action Plan (DEAP), and would&#13;
include control of point and nonpoint pollution in the Dianchi Lake Basin&#13;
through improved catchment management, wastewater and stormwater&#13;
collection, treatment and disposal; improved collection, transport and&#13;
disposal of municipal solid waste and nightsoil; remediation of polluting&#13;
practices causing lake eutrophication; measures to strengthen Dianchi&#13;
Lake basin management and safeguard the long term quality of water&#13;
resources; and improvements to basin water resource allocation, to ensure&#13;
that the highest quality water is used for the most quality-sensitive uses,&#13;
such as for potable supply. The latter would be supported through&#13;
investments in upgraded trunk and distribution water mains, water&#13;
treatment, and associated actions and facilities to protect and increase the&#13;
water supply in Kunming;                        $199.6 million&#13;
(b)   Industrial Pollution Control. Direct investment financial support would&#13;
be provided to abate industrial pollution from enterprises identified in the&#13;
DEAP as most threatening to Dianchi Lake basin resources. Enterprises&#13;
have been ranked according to environmental impact, using rankings to be&#13;
confirmed during appraisal. The cleanup would focus on two fertilizer&#13;
plants, found to be the top-ranked industrial polluters in terms of&#13;
phosphorus load to Dianchi Lake. Support to abate pollution from lower-&#13;
ranked enterprises requiring smaller investments would be through an&#13;
Environmental Pollution Control Fund Subloans (EPCSL) Facility;&#13;
$34.1 million&#13;
(c)   Provincial Urban Environmental Services. Investments in catchment&#13;
management, wastewater and stormwater collection and treatment systems&#13;
for the protection of Gejiu Lake and Qujing's Nanpanjiang River; selective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-127 -                     ANNEX7&#13;
investments in water supply system extensions in Qujing; and improved&#13;
collection, transport and disposal of municipal solid waste and nightsoil in&#13;
Qujing;                                          $48.6 million&#13;
(d)   Environmental and Water Quality Monitoring. Support for upgrading&#13;
and modernizing environmental management and water quality&#13;
information and monitoring systems.               $6.2 million&#13;
(e)   Institutional Development, Training and Construction Supervision.&#13;
Strengthening provincial, municipal, project, and financial management;&#13;
construction supervision services; training in utility operations; updating&#13;
of city environmental action plans and feasibility studies; and future&#13;
project preparation.                             $19.1 million&#13;
TOTAL ESTIMATED PROJECT COST                    $307.6 million&#13;
12.   The financial, urban environment service delivery and utility management policy&#13;
initiatives would concentrate on (a) operational efficiency improvements; (b) resource&#13;
mobilization and cost recovery measures; (c) long term financial and economic&#13;
sustainability underpinning; and (d) industrial pollution reduction through focused time-&#13;
bound Action Plans with respect to pollution from paper, steel and pesticides. The&#13;
institutional development and policy strengthening component [para. 3.2(e)] would&#13;
enhance policies and operational experience in environmental protection and water,&#13;
wastewater, municipal solid waste and nightsoil management. Support to these initiatives&#13;
has been grouped into a number of main composite packages for the various executing&#13;
agencies, covering institutional development, financial management improvement,&#13;
construction supervision and training. The component would also support provincial and&#13;
sector city agencies, master planning, future project preparation, and other programs of&#13;
assistance to be defined.&#13;
Baseline Data&#13;
13.   General. Yunnan is the third poorest province in China. The economy of&#13;
Yunnan is dominated by primary production, principally agriculture, with manufacturing&#13;
accounting for a relatively small proportion of output. Kunming is a substantial industrial&#13;
center, dominating the provincial economy. There is evidence of a shift toward tertiary&#13;
sector activities in recent years.&#13;
14.   An important feature of industry in both Yunnan and Kunming is the dominance&#13;
of state-owned enterprises, principally at provincial and municipal level. These account&#13;
for about 75 percent of gross output, compared with a corresponding figure of 43 percent&#13;
for China as a whole. This is an important factor in environmental terms, because many&#13;
are loss-making, in some cases, such as fertilizer production, as a consequence of Central&#13;
Government controls on output prices. As a result many appear to be unable to fund&#13;
pollution control measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-128 -                     ANNEX7&#13;
15.   Qujing is the second largest city in Yunnan, with a population of 161,500, and is&#13;
located some 156 km to the northeast of Kunming. Industry has expanded rapidly in&#13;
recent years and Qujing is one of the six cities in Yunnan designated for high short-term&#13;
economic and population growth (the population is expected to more than double by&#13;
2010). Industrial activity is based on cigarette production, nonferrous metallurgy,&#13;
chemicals and automobile manufacture. Qujing is well located on the road and rail&#13;
networks for ready access both to Kunming and to other provinces.&#13;
16.   Gejiu is located to the south of Kunming in a mountainous area in the&#13;
southernmost part of Yunnan. The city has grown largely around the development of the&#13;
tin mining and processing industries. The population of Gejiu city is currently 134,000,&#13;
with a further 80,000 in four satellite towns that house most of the major industries.&#13;
17.   Climate. Yunnan has a northern subtropical monsoon climate, with extremes of&#13;
temperature moderated by altitude and latitude. Precipitation is plentiful (ranging&#13;
between 800 and 1,000 mm/year) and the province as a whole is relatively water rich,&#13;
with per capita runoff approaching 2.5 times the national average. The average annual&#13;
temperature in the Dianchi Lake basin is 14.70. There is a pronounced wet season, from&#13;
May to September, during which more than 70 percent of the rainfall occurs. However,&#13;
regional differences in the balance between rainfall and evaporation and substantial&#13;
temporal variability in rainfall result in areas with very limited water resources. The&#13;
Dianchi Lake basin is one such area. Evaporation from land surfaces in the basin is high,&#13;
in the order of 2,000 mm. The principal wind direction is southwest, with mean wind&#13;
speeds in the range 2.2 to 3 m/sec.&#13;
18.   Water Resources. The water resources of the Dianchi Lake basin are severely&#13;
limited, with per capita runoff only 3 percent of the world and 5 percent of national mean&#13;
levels. Renewable water resources are currently average 31 1 mi3 per capita, but as a result&#13;
of population growth this will fall in 2020 to 200 m3 on average and as low as 90 m3 in a&#13;
drought year. The latter figure would barely be sufficient to support domestic water&#13;
demand alone.&#13;
19.   At present water demands (agricultural, industrial and domestic) in the Dianchi&#13;
Lake basin exceed supply by between 177 Mm3/year and 578 Mm3/year in average and&#13;
dry (20 percentile) years respectively. This supply imbalance is corrected by recycling of&#13;
water, mainly the discharges of untreated wastewater from Kunming to the Dianchi Lake.&#13;
20.   As a result of the temporal variations in rainfall water, supply depends heavily&#13;
upon reservoir storage. The principal supply source for Kunming is the Songhuaba&#13;
Reservoir, which has the dual roles of water supply and flood protection. The mean&#13;
annual runoff and total storage volume of Songhuaba Reservoir are 198 Mm3 and&#13;
229 Mm3, respectively. However, because of flood control requirements (1 in 100-year&#13;
flood), the effective storage available for water supply is only 100 Mm3, which gives a&#13;
mean annual yield of 130 Mm3 (350,000 m3/d) with an assurance rate of 95 percent. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-129 -                      ANNEX7&#13;
practice the reservoir is operated at a level 1.5 m below the operating rule curve because&#13;
farmers have not received compensation payments for the loss of land involved.&#13;
21.   The reservoir currently supplies water for agricultural as well as municipal use. It&#13;
is proposed in future to substitute Dianchi Lake water for use in agriculture to conserve&#13;
the better quality Songhuaba water for potable supply.&#13;
22.   The majority of the water demand in Kunming is met by abstractions from&#13;
Dianchi Lake, amounting to 480,000 m3/d. The Dianchi Lake has an average depth of&#13;
approximately 4.5 m and the overall storage volume is 1,250 Mm3. However, the&#13;
effective storage is substantially less than this figure because of the flood control&#13;
requirements. The lake receives runoff from urban rivers in Kunming, which receive&#13;
overspill from Songhuaba Reservoir, but in the dry season are largely open sewers, and&#13;
from rivers traversing the agricultural areas to the east and south of the lake.&#13;
23.   Flood protection is achieved by the discharge of water from the lake via the sole&#13;
outlet at Haikou, at the southwest of the lake, to the Tanglangchuan river. The hydraulic&#13;
capacity of the Tanglangchuan is limited, and a further flood alleviation measure, the&#13;
Xiyuan Tunnel at the northeast of the lake, has been constructed to increase the rate of&#13;
discharge of floodwater. In spite of these and other measures aimed at increasing the&#13;
effective storage in Dianchi Lake, the increased water demands are such that they can&#13;
only be met by ever increasing recycling of Kunming municipal wastewater.&#13;
24.   The principal watercourse in Qujing municipality is the Nanpanjiang, which&#13;
provides the majority of the water supply to Qujing via three reservoirs on its tributaries.&#13;
The remainder is obtained from groundwater. These resources are insufficient to meet&#13;
future demands, for which it will be necessary to import water from distant reservoirs.&#13;
25.   Gejiu derives water supplies from a combination of three reservoirs to the south of&#13;
the City and from groundwater and springs. Most of industry is supplied from Gejiu&#13;
Lake, an artificial lake constructed in 1955 with a volume of about 4 Mm3 largely for&#13;
flood protection. The lake has for many years received discharges of urban wastewater,&#13;
soil eroded from mining areas above the city and tailings from tin processing. As a result&#13;
there has been a substantial reduction in its effective volume and self-purification&#13;
capacity. Between 1961 and 1986 sediments were dredged from the lake, which&#13;
maintained a reasonable storage capacity.&#13;
26.   During the dry season, wastewater discharges to the lake constitute about two-&#13;
thirds of the available water supply. Water abstraction by industry in the dry season in&#13;
the order of 3 Mm3, and therefore this inflow of wastewater, or a suitable replacement, is&#13;
crucial to the water balance of the lake if abstractions are to continue.&#13;
27.   Water Quality. The Chinese water quality classification is based on five levels&#13;
of beneficial water use, as shown in Table 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130-                     ANNEX7&#13;
TABLE 1: CHINA: WATER QUALITY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM&#13;
Classification               Description of Water Use Function&#13;
I        National Nature Protection Area&#13;
II        Domestic Potable Water Source-Grade I protection area, precious&#13;
fish and fish culture zone&#13;
III       Domestic Potable Water Source-Grade II protection area, general&#13;
fish and bathing areas&#13;
IV        Industrial Water Use and Recreation&#13;
V         Agricultural and general amenity use&#13;
28.   Water quality in Songhuaba Reservoir is currently classified as Class II, but the&#13;
limited data available indicate increasing nutrient concentrations in the reservoir and&#13;
hence progressive eutrophication. Although the reservoir catchment was designated a&#13;
Water Protection Zone in 1981 but continuing lack of control has resulted in increasing&#13;
farming and rural township expansion in the area.&#13;
29.   The Dianchi Lake is divided into two parts, the Caohai (inner lake) and the much&#13;
larger Waihai (outer lake), which accounts for about 97 percent of the lake. The Caohai&#13;
and the Waihai are physically separated by a barrage completed in 1996. The municipal&#13;
and industrial wastewater from Kunming is discharged, mainly untreated into both the&#13;
Caohai and Waihai.&#13;
30.   There are currently only two operational sewage treatment works in Kunming,&#13;
treating a flow of 155,000 m3/d, which discharges ultimately to the Caohai. A further two&#13;
plants are under construction, with a total treatment capacity of 260,000 m3/d, of which&#13;
210,000 m3/d will be discharged to the Waihai. Treatment processes at all sewage&#13;
treatment works incorporate partial removal of both nitrogen and phosphorus.&#13;
31.   The Caohai is particularly polluted, with water quality failing to comply even with&#13;
Class V standards. In particular the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus are high,&#13;
typically up to 7.5 and 0.9 mg/l respectively. Water quality in the Waihai has also&#13;
deteriorated in recent years, and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are again high,&#13;
averaging 1.5 and 0.14 mg/l respectively in 1995.&#13;
32.   Water is abstracted from the Waihai for treatment at two water treatment plants.&#13;
However, poor water quality in terms of algal growths resulting from the high nutrient&#13;
concentrations are causing severe treatment difficulties. In particular, one water intake&#13;
close to the boundary with the Caohai has been closed and additional treatment processes,&#13;
using ozone and activated carbon are proposed for the treatment works treating water&#13;
from the Waihai.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-131-                      ANNEX7&#13;
33.   Phosphorus has been identified as the growth-limiting nutrient and therefore the&#13;
principal focus of nutrient load reduction in wastewater treatment.  The potential&#13;
phosphorus loads to both the Caohai and Waihai are shown in Table 2.&#13;
TABLE 2: PHOSPHORUS LOADS TO DIANCHI LAKE (1995)&#13;

34.   Table 2 shows that the loads are in both cases dominated by point source&#13;
discharges of urban and industrial wastewater. Moreover, the data of loads from&#13;
nonpoint sources are based on very limited measurements and are considered to be&#13;
overestimates.&#13;
35.   Discharges to the Caohai have in the past entered the Waihai, and therefore the&#13;
load to the Waihai would have been greater than that indicated in Table 2. However, the&#13;
construction of the barrage and the Xiyuan tunnel has now allowed the diversion in dry&#13;
weather of water from the Caohai, principally urban wastewater, away from the Waihai to&#13;
the downstream Tanglangchuan river. In addition to the high nutrient levels in both the&#13;
Caohai and the Waihai there is concern also at discharges of organic matter from&#13;
municipal wastewater and toxins from industry.&#13;
36.   The Tanglangchuan river receives water discharged from the Waihai at Haikou&#13;
throughout the year, either for flood control purposes or to maintain a base flow in the dry&#13;
season. There is considerable exploitation of the Tanglangchuan for irrigated agriculture&#13;
and by industry. Water quality in the Tanglangchuan is poor as a result of discharges of&#13;
untreated industrial wastewater. Water is wastefully discharged from Dianchi Lake&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-132 -                      ANNEX7&#13;
simply to provide dilution of this pollution to maintain even the present level of water&#13;
quality.&#13;
37.   Water quality in the Nanpanjiang upstream of Qujing and in the reservoirs serving&#13;
Qujing is generally good, typically meeting Class I standards. However, the Nanpanjiang&#13;
is seriously polluted by discharges of municipal wastewater from Qujing and of industrial&#13;
wastewater, including discharges from two fertilizer plants and a paper mill. As a result&#13;
water quality has declined to Class V, principally in terms of high chemical oxygen&#13;
demand (COD) and ammonia concentrations. The stated objective is to improve water&#13;
quality to Class IV by 2000 and to Class III by 2010.&#13;
38.   Gejiu Lake has been seriously polluted by the large discharges of municipal and&#13;
industrial wastewater, with water quality failing to meet even Class V standards. Even&#13;
during cooler months quiescent areas appear black and septic. Sediments are highly&#13;
contaminated with metals (arsenic, lead and cadmium) discharged from tin mining and&#13;
related activities, although there have been dramatic reductions in toxic metal discharges&#13;
over the past 20 years. The objective for Gejiu Lake is to improve water quality to&#13;
Class IV, sufficient to support industrial water use and recreation.&#13;
39.   The principal cause of the deteriorating water quality in all cases is the virtual&#13;
absence of effective wastewater treatment, particularly in the case of industry. The&#13;
primary instrument in China for control of industrial pollution is the effluent fee system,&#13;
but the fees charged are considerably below levels necessary to have the required&#13;
incentive effect in terms of wastewater treatment. Moreover, there is only partial&#13;
collection of fees, particularly in Kunming, where the collection rate is only of the order&#13;
of 20 percent.&#13;
40.   Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecology. Approximately 22 percent of the Dianchi&#13;
Lake basin is occupied by cropped land and about 37 percent by forests. The forests&#13;
consist principally of subtropical evergreen broad-leafed species but also include areas of&#13;
deciduous broad leafed forest, temperate pine forest, shrub grassland, bamboo forest and&#13;
grassland. Eucalyptus globulus has been introduced as a plantation species and occurs&#13;
throughout the basin.&#13;
41.   There has been considerable degradation of the forest as a result of use of wood as&#13;
a fuel and of problems of forest management control and land allocation. Nevertheless&#13;
the proportion of the basin area accounted for by forest cover remains the same as that in&#13;
1975.&#13;
42.   Fish species diversity in Dianchi Lake declined between the late 1950s and 1985&#13;
from 53 to 27 as a result of protective dike construction and land reclamation. These&#13;
activities destroyed the shallow water areas where fish would normally breed and have&#13;
nursery grounds. Of the surviving 32 species, only 6 are now of commercial importance,&#13;
but the total annual yield has declined much less dramatically than species numbers.&#13;
Dianchi Lake remains the largest fish producer in Yunnan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133 -                       ANNEX 7&#13;
43.   The dike construction and land reclamation activities have contributed to the&#13;
degradation of the Dianchi Lake in respect of widespread destruction of its littoral zone&#13;
and of aquatic macrophytes. In addition deforestation contributed to the phosphorus&#13;
loading to the lake as a result of soil erosion, which has also reduced the lake volume.&#13;
The problems of the Dianchi Lake therefore derive both from the increase in the loads of&#13;
phosphorus to the lake and from the reduction in its ability to assimilate phosphorus as a&#13;
result of the disruption of its natural ecology.&#13;
44.   Waste Management. Overall responsibility for the collection and disposal of&#13;
municipal and commercial wastes and street sweepings rests with the City Appearance&#13;
Committees, under the leadership and guidance of the Municipal Environmental&#13;
Sanitation Sections. Collection of solid wastes is generally effective, although in some&#13;
areas unsightly large quantities of waste line roadsides and river banks, where it is left to&#13;
decompose for subsequent use as compost.&#13;
45.   Disposal of solid wastes has traditionally been to land, principally to numerous&#13;
large and small open dumps, and not using acceptable standards of sanitary landfill. Two&#13;
major sites serving Kunming have received more than 2 million tons over the past&#13;
10 years. The open dumps are unhygienic and unsatisfactory and are not registered or&#13;
monitored. Since the dumps are neither lined nor covered, there are potential problems of&#13;
leachate and windblown pollution. There is also particular concern over the uncontrolled&#13;
disposal of toxic wastes.&#13;
46.   Quantities of municipal solid waste on a per capita basis are declining in mass&#13;
terms as a result of the change from coal to gas as a fuel. As a result the organic content&#13;
is higher. There are informal recycling activities, but the proportion of waste recycled is&#13;
unknown. The decline in the use of nightsoil by farmers in favor of chemical fertilizers&#13;
has resulted in the disposal of increasing quantities of nightsoil with the solid waste&#13;
streain.&#13;
Consideration of Alternatives&#13;
47.   In most cases the approaches adopted for the various project components&#13;
represent the only realistic option in terms of resource availability or achievement of the&#13;
required environmental objective. Where multiple options were available, the least-cost&#13;
solution achieving the required objective was selected.&#13;
48.   In the case of rehabilitation of the Dianchi Lake with respect to its trophic state, it&#13;
would not be possible within a realistic timeframe to enhance sufficiently the ability of&#13;
the lake to assimilate phosphorus. The only realistic approach to improving water quality&#13;
in the immediate term is therefore to reduce the phosphorus loads discharged to the lake.&#13;
49.   The proposed Kunming wastewater treatment works processes are based on&#13;
biological treatment incorporating nitrogen and phosphorus removal in addition to&#13;
achieving a high degree of removal of organic matter. The alternative of a totally&#13;
chemically based treatment system would not readily be able to achieve all the required&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-134-                      ANNEX7&#13;
discharge standards, particularly in respect of removal of nitrogen and organic matter.&#13;
Further removal of nutrients from the Waihai by diversion of treated wastewater to the&#13;
Caohai and thence via the Xiyuan tunnel was rejected in view of water resource&#13;
limitations on the Waihai. Reducing the phosphorus loads in domestic wastewater by&#13;
enforcing the use of phosphate-free detergents would not of itself reduce loads by a&#13;
sufficient degree to obviate the need for phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment.&#13;
Since phosphorus removal in treatment is not directly dependent upon concentration in&#13;
the raw wastewater, a ban on phosphate in detergents would not be appropriate.&#13;
50.   Sanitary landfill was preferred to other waste disposal options in all cases.&#13;
Incineration would not be appropriate in view of the low heat value of the wastes,&#13;
resulting from either a high inert ash content, arising from domestic use of coal as a fuel,&#13;
or from a high moisture content. Composting was rejected in view of concerns over&#13;
adequacy and stability of product market outlets. Moreover, landfill would be required in&#13;
any event for reject materials from other options.&#13;
Environmental Benefits&#13;
51.   The balance of the project is substantially positive, and there are considerable&#13;
environmental benefits for the Dianchi Lake basin and for the cities of Qujing and Gejiu.&#13;
These benefits are discussed in detail below.&#13;
52.   Dianchi Lake Basin. The primary focus of the sewage treatment works and&#13;
industrial pollution control projects is the reduction of the point source loads of nutrients,&#13;
principally phosphorus, to the Dianchi Lake, particularly the Waihai. The proposed&#13;
municipal sewage treatment works, Nos. 4b and 5 and extension to No. 1, are designed to&#13;
achieve the National Integrated Discharge Standard, in particular a phosphorus&#13;
concentration in the treated wastewater of not more than 1 mg/l. On this basis they will&#13;
achieve reductions in phosphorus loads of between 60 and 80 percent, depending upon&#13;
initial phosphorus concentrations which are a function of the relative contribution of&#13;
industrial wastewater. Removal of organic matter from wastewater will be in the order of&#13;
90 percent.&#13;
53.  In addition the associated sewerage systems will collect urban wastewater that&#13;
currently discharges to the rivers that traverse Kunming. As a result there will be a&#13;
substantial improvement in water quality in these rivers.&#13;
54.   The water supply and treatment components will not of themselves have a direct&#13;
benefit on water quality in Dianchi Lake. They will, however, permit a more optimal use&#13;
of the water resources in the basin in that they will increase the use of the higher quality&#13;
water from Songhuaba Reservoir for domestic potable supply.&#13;
55.   The pollution control proposals for the two fertilizer factories, Kunyang&#13;
Phosphorus Fertilizer and Kunming Chemical Fertilizer, are based on a combination of&#13;
process upgrading, water conservation and wastewater treatment. The phosphorus load&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-135 -                      ANNEX7&#13;
from the former factory will be reduced by 54.5 t/year (98 percent) and from the latter by&#13;
35 t/year (97 percent).&#13;
56.   Wastewater treatment for the rural townships of Chenggong and Jinning would&#13;
also be based on biological treatment including removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. The&#13;
treatment proposed will reduce the phosphorus loads to the Waihai from these sources by&#13;
in the order of 75 percent.&#13;
57.   The overall benefit of the wastewater treatment components in terms of reductions&#13;
in phosphorus loads to the Waihai is shown in Table 3. The loads referred to in the table&#13;
relate to conditions obtaining in the year 2010, the time horizon of the designs for all&#13;
project components.&#13;
58.   It will be seen from Table 3 that the prospective phosphorus loads that would be&#13;
generated in 2010 represent a very substantial increase, some 40 percent over the 1995&#13;
case. The increase is principally as a result of population growth and increased living&#13;
standards, including the progressive abandonment of the nightsoil system.&#13;
59.   The existing and proposed interventions (principally wastewater treatment plants&#13;
Nos. 2 and 4a, the former constructed with assistance from bilateral funding) could&#13;
potentially achieve a significant reduction in phosphorus load.  However, their&#13;
effectiveness is to some degree reduced by deficiencies in sewerage systems and therefore&#13;
degree of collection of wastewater for treatment. The values in Table 3 for the 2010 case&#13;
with the existing and proposed interventions assumes that, until the sewerage system&#13;
improvements are implemented, the treatment works will continue to treat polluted water&#13;
drawn from the adjacent rivers. These rivers are in any event open sewers in the dry&#13;
season, and it has been assumed that 25 percent of the annual phosphorus load of the&#13;
sewage drawn from the rivers will escape in storm water during the wet season.&#13;
60.   The wastewater treatment plant designs are based on achieving a residual&#13;
phosphorus concentration of not more than 1 mg/l, and therefore the average&#13;
concentration would be significantly lower than I mg/l. Table 3 shows the estimates of&#13;
the phosphorus loads discharged which based on a residual concentration in the treated&#13;
wastewater of 0.5 mg/l, which relates more closely to the likely average concentration.&#13;
61.   Implementation of the wastewater collection and treatment components of the&#13;
project, together with the pollution control proposals for the two fertilizer plants, reduce&#13;
the 2010 total phosphorus load by about 50 percent, to a level some 33 percent below the&#13;
1995 level. Moreover, it is considered that this simple evaluation based on total&#13;
phosphorus understates the potential effectiveness of the proposals.  Much of the&#13;
phosphorus associated with the nonpoint sources is in the form of insoluble particulates&#13;
and therefore not readily available for algal consumption. It has conservatively been&#13;
estimated that 70 percent of the phosphorus from nonpoint sources is insoluble. When&#13;
this factor is taken into account, the potential load reduction achieved by the project is&#13;
estimated to be 46 percent relative to the 1995 level.&#13;

62.   The corresponding reductions to the Caohai are shown also in Table 3, and a&#13;
similar situation obtains in respect of the need for sewerage system enhancement to&#13;
ensure that the proposed wastewater treatment plants, Nos. 1 and 3, can be effective in&#13;
reducing phosphorus loads. Again the implementation of the project proposals is&#13;
estimated to reduce the load of phosphorus to the Caohai to significantly below the 1995&#13;
case.&#13;
63.   In view of these substantial reductions in phosphorus load it would be expected&#13;
that there would be a significant reduction in phosphorus concentrations in the Waihai,&#13;
and therefore a corresponding reduction in the water treatment problems relative to those&#13;
currently experienced. In practice the degree and rate of recovery will to a certain extent&#13;
be limited by the reduced ability of the Waihai to assimilate phosphorus as a consequence&#13;
of the disruption of the natural ecology. The relationship between phosphorus loads to&#13;
the Waihai and the concentration of phosphorus on an annual average basis has been&#13;
evaluated using a mathematical model that simulates the effect of various processes&#13;
occurring in the lake (e.g., sedimentation, uptake by fish). The calculated phosphorus&#13;
concentrations for the period 1995 to 2015 resulting from the implementation of YEP and&#13;
for the Do Nothing More cases, based on implementation only of the wastewater&#13;
treatment interventions already planned are shown in Figure 1.&#13;
64.   It is apparent from Figure 1 that implementation of YEP will sustain phosphorus&#13;
concentrations in the Waihai at, or around, present levels and will therefore allow&#13;
continued use for water supply, albeit with extensive treatment such as ozone and&#13;
activated carbon. Failure to implement YEP will result in increases in phosphorus&#13;
concentrations to levels where even advanced treatment would become extremely&#13;
problematic and it would be necessary to substitute Dianchi Lake by water imported from&#13;
distant catchments. Figure I also shows that, even if it were possible to prevent all&#13;
discharges of phosphorus, of whatever source, to the Waihai, it would be in the order of&#13;
10 years before phosphorus concentrations returned to historic low levels.&#13;
65.   The two sanitary landfill sites proposed for Kunming will provide capacity for the&#13;
environmentally acceptable disposal of solid wastes from Kunming for approximately&#13;
20 years, and thereby reduce the potential impact on groundwater and surface waters&#13;
from  the present uncontrolled tipping of waste.  There will be corresponding&#13;
improvements in the efficiency of collection and transport, which will reduce the&#13;
environmental degradation and visual pollution arising from unauthorized dumping of&#13;
waste in urban areas.&#13;
Qujing&#13;
66.   The water supply component for Qujing will alleviate raw water shortages,&#13;
particularly in dry years when as low as only 60 percent of urban demand has been met.&#13;
The wastewater treatment plant, with a capacity of 100,000 m3/d, provides only partial&#13;
treatment in the immediate term, based on chemically assisted primary sedimentation. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-138-                      ANNEX7&#13;
will nevertheless remove a substantial pollution load, but the longer-tern water quality&#13;
objectives for the Nanpanjiang will require also control of industrial wastewater.&#13;

67.   The wastes management proposals will provide environmentally sound landfill&#13;
disposal facilities for wastes from Qujing, replacing the existing largely uncontrolled&#13;
dump sites which are known to be polluting groundwater. The waste collection&#13;
improvements, including transfer stations, will improve collection efficiency and reduce&#13;
the degree of flytipping.&#13;
Gejiu&#13;
68.   The wastewater and flood protection proposals for Gejiu, in addition to improving&#13;
discharges of water from Gejiu lake, will collect wastewater currently discharged to the&#13;
lake and thereby reduce the pollution load that the lake receives. The wastewater&#13;
discharged to the Zhadian River will provide additional water for agricultural use.&#13;
Impacts and Mitigation&#13;
69.   Notwithstanding the very substantial positive balance of environmental impact of&#13;
the project, there are nevertheless some adverse impacts that require mitigation. These&#13;
impacts occur both in construction and operational phases of the project components.&#13;
The principal impacts and the proposed mitigation measures are described in detail&#13;
below; a summary of impacts and mitigations is given in Table 4.&#13;

Keep landfill moist and use consolidated soils for&#13;

Land Acquisition&#13;
70.     With the exception only of the pollution control projects for the fertilizer factories&#13;
all components require land acquisition on either a temporary or permanent basis. The&#13;
total permanent land acquisition requirement is 224 ha, with 163 ha in the Dianchi Lake&#13;
basin, 59.7 ha in Qujing and 1.8 ha in Gejiu respectively. The areas of land to be&#13;
acquired are dominated by the landfill site requirements, which account for 123 ha for&#13;
Kunming, of which 67 ha for one site has already been acquired, and 45.7 ha for Qujing.&#13;
Resettlement&#13;
71.     All project components affect local residents or enterprises and their employees.&#13;
The total number of persons affected is 2,966, but there will not be a need for any&#13;
residential resettlement. A total of four enterprises will be affected, three in the extension&#13;
of WTP No. I and one in the extension of STW No. 1. A detailed Resettlement Action&#13;
Plan has been prepared, and resettlement is described in detail in Annex 6.&#13;
Wastewater Treatment Impacts&#13;
72.     The principal impact associated with wastewater treatment is the generation of&#13;
substantial quantities  of treatment residues  (sludge, grit and  screenings).   At full&#13;
development of wastewater treatment facilities in Kunming the total quantity of sludge&#13;
requiring disposal would be in the order of 200 t/d in the form of dewatered sludge cake.&#13;
Even where the quality of sludge would be acceptable for use in agriculture, it is unlikely&#13;
that there would be sufficient demand for use in agriculture to reduce this quantity&#13;
significantly. The primary disposal route will therefore be by landfill at the new sites&#13;
serving Kunming. Disposal of sludge from the wastewater treatment facilities at Qujing&#13;
and Gejiu will be for agricultural use where possible or by landfill.&#13;
73.     The other main impacts of wastewater treatment are odor and noise, principally&#13;
from aeration equipment. Problems of odor are minimized in most cases by the absence&#13;
of primary treatment and hence the need to process primary sludge. Odor will be further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-141-                        ANNEX7&#13;
minimized by rapid disposal of sludge to avoid storage and by providing greenbelt buffer&#13;
zones around the periphery of the sites. Noise impact will be minimized by plant design&#13;
to maximize distances from any sensitive receivers, and where necessary by acoustic&#13;
insulation of buildings.&#13;
Waste Disposal Impacts&#13;
74.   The major impacts from  landfill disposal of municipal waste will be the&#13;
generation of leachate and of landfill gas. At all sites groundwater will be protected by&#13;
provision of synthetic site liners and by collection of leachate. It is proposed to store&#13;
leachate for recirculation through the landfill, thereby minimizing both the quantity for&#13;
disposal and its polluting character.&#13;
75.   The location of the sites, a substantial distance from  significant centers of&#13;
population, is beneficial in terms of reducing odor nuisance. However, it also means that&#13;
it is unlikely that beneficial use of landfill gas for energy recovery will be economic.&#13;
Landfill gas will therefore be flared for safety reasons and for conversion of methane, a&#13;
potent greenhouse gas, to the less potent carbon dioxide.&#13;
Spoil Disposal&#13;
76.   Considerable quantities of excavation spoil will be generated during the&#13;
construction of all water and wastewater treatment plants, water transmission and&#13;
sewerage systems. In particular there will be substantial amounts of tunneling spoil from&#13;
the DuMu aqueduct in Qujing and the tunnel in Gejiu. A detailed spoil disposal plan will&#13;
be prepared, incorporating wherever possible the beneficial use of spoil in construction&#13;
activities or landscaping.&#13;
Industry Impacts&#13;
77.   The production upgrading proposals at the two fertilizer plants include in one case&#13;
new facilities for production of sulfuric acid from  sulfur.  Tail gases from  these&#13;
production facilities contain sulfur dioxide and acid aerosols and are to be discharged to&#13;
the atmosphere via tall (at least 45 m) stacks.  In the individual environmental&#13;
assessments for the two plants it was shown by calculation that the discharges would not&#13;
result in unacceptable ground-level ambient concentrations of the pollutants.&#13;
Other Construction Impacts&#13;
78.   A number of other impacts will arise as a result of construction activities,&#13;
including disruption to traffic and municipal services, temporary loss of farmland, noise&#13;
and dust. In all cases impact will be minimized by adherence to defined operational&#13;
procedures, liaison with the appropriate authorities and appropriate compensation where&#13;
necessary. For example, noise impact will be minimized by restrictions on hours of&#13;
working and dust from excavation and spoil transport by means of water sprays and by&#13;
vehicle washing, covering and controls on loading.&#13;

ANNEX 12: INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION CONTROL&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Yunnan's industrial growth of nearly 9 percent per year over the past decade has&#13;
been accompanied by increasing discharges of wastewater, solid waste, and air pollutants.&#13;
An increasingly strict environmental regulatory regime has held waste discharges below the&#13;
overall growth rate, but wastewater and air polluting discharges have still grown some 6&#13;
percent per year. Naturally, the impact of this growth varies with location, industrial&#13;
concentration and type of effluent. The candidate cities for the YEP have the largest&#13;
concentrations of industry, and some of the most highly polluting, in the province:&#13;
Kunming and Gejiu industry discharge to lakes with declining absorptive capacity and&#13;
Qujing industrial discharges to the Nanpanjiang River have already rendered that body&#13;
unusable for several kilometers below the city. Heavy metal and toxic organic chemical&#13;
discharges continue in all of those cities. Of the worst 100 polluting industries in Yunnan,&#13;
Kunming contains 27, the Gejiu/Kaiyuan area 19, and Qujing 16.&#13;
2.    In the province as a whole, the chemical industry remains the worst polluter,&#13;
responsible for 62 percent of all industrial water pollution and providing 30 of the top 100&#13;
polluters (22 for wastewater pollution, 8 for air pollution). Next comes the metallurgical&#13;
industry, with 14 percent of wastewater and 27 percent of air pollution, and 20 of the top&#13;
polluters. The pulp and paper industry ranks third, with 23 of the top polluters, all in&#13;
wastewater, and sugarcane processing next with 6 top polluters, again all in wastewater.&#13;
Other top polluters include a variety of thermal power plants and cement plants, with air&#13;
pollution being their main problem.&#13;
3.    Kunming's Lake Dianchi provides one measure of the relative impact of industrial&#13;
pollution. This lake has become eutrophic, with serious consequences for beneficial uses of&#13;
the lake. Phosphorus is the limiting nutrient in Dianchi, and annual available phosphorus&#13;
loads are judged to total some 522 tons, of which industry contributes 115 tons, or 22&#13;
percent. Of the 115 tons of available industrial phosphorus, two plants, those of the&#13;
Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Company and the Kunyang Phosphorus Fertilizer Company,&#13;
contribute three-fourths of the load. The other major sources of phosphorus include&#13;
domestic and animal wastes, carried directly or, along with other sources, by storm runoff&#13;
and precipitation. Heavy metal loads discharging to Lake Dianchi have been largely&#13;
controlled, but in the recent past have forced the temporary closing of water treatment&#13;
plants and residual loads in the lake sediment remain large.&#13;
4.    Analysis of pollution sources and abatement costs in Yunnan demonstrates the&#13;
relatively low cost of addressing some pollutants at source. Reduction of phosphorus, for&#13;
example, costs about Y 2.7 million per ton per year in capital costs at the Kunyang&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-154 -                      ANNEX 12&#13;
Phosphorus Fertilizer Plant and Y 6 million per ton per year in capital costs in the planned&#13;
Kunming No. 5 municipal treatment plant. Where pollutants are toxic to the conventional&#13;
wastewater treatment processes used in Yunnan municipal plants, or bypass those plants,&#13;
source control cannot be avoided. The Industrial Pollution Control component of the&#13;
project addresses these industrial point sources.&#13;
5.    The IPC component relies on a three part strategy: (a) direct onlending to clean up&#13;
the two fertilizer plants that are major polluters; (b) lending for a number of smaller&#13;
pollution control investments through an Environmental Pollution Control Subloans&#13;
(EPCSL) Facility, to be capitalized at $10 million, utilizing $5 million of proceeds of the&#13;
Bank loan/IDA credit, and an equal amount of local currency; and (c) action plans for the&#13;
cleanup of the Kunming Steel General Company and the Yunfeng Paper Mill, financed&#13;
through non-Bank sources, as well as ceasing operations in the manufacture and handling of&#13;
pesticides and other toxic materials at the Kunming Agricultural Chemical Factory plant by&#13;
June 30, 1998, to protect municipal wastewater treatment facilities. This annex discusses in&#13;
turn each part of the strategy.&#13;
FERTILIZER PLANT FINANCING FOR POLLUTION ABATEMENT&#13;
6.    Two fertilizer plants in the Dianchi Basin-the Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer&#13;
Factory and the Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Factory-between them contribute 16 percent&#13;
of all available phosphate discharged into Dianchi Lake, and 73 percent of the industrial&#13;
contribution. Existing wastewater treatment facilities at the factories lack adequate design&#13;
capacity to handle waste flows, and the equipment breaks down with such frequency that&#13;
treatment goals remain unmet. Kunyang Phosphate maintains a modest profit of Y 3&#13;
million per year, or a return of about 2 percent on capital, while the Kunming Chemical&#13;
Fertilizer Factory eamed about Y 1.5 million in 1995 on capital of Y 90 million. In a&#13;
government attempt to hold down agricultural input prices, the fertilizer industry remains&#13;
one of the few subject to strict output price controls, coupled with mandated production.&#13;
Consequently, losses in these industries are known as "policy losses" and are covered&#13;
through subsidies to the plants (the Kunming Factory profit came after a Y4 million subsidy&#13;
payment). Despite the subsidies, the plants lack adequate operation and maintenance funds,&#13;
which exacerbates operating pressures on the waste treatment systems. The proposed&#13;
investments in the plants would radically change their production processes and&#13;
intermediate outputs, allowing profitable operation despite output price restraints.&#13;
Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Factory&#13;
7.    Kunyang contributes 57 tons per year of phosphorus to Dianchi, approximately 90&#13;
percent of that in soluble, or available, form. The plant produces a variety of phosphate&#13;
fertilizers and phosphate-based food additives, in addition to producing sulfuric acid for use&#13;
in producing double superphosphate. Current production processes do not maximize water&#13;
reuse, wastewater treatment cannot meet flow requirements, and obsolete equipment with&#13;
high breakdown rates leads to frequent unplanned discharges of process water. The&#13;
proposed project would rebuild much of the plant to maximize water reuse and minimize&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-155-                       ANNEX12&#13;
pollution, leading to smaller, more easily handled wastewater streams. Those wastewater&#13;
streams would then undergo treatment improved from that currently used.&#13;
8.    The wastewater minimization engineering, coupled with raw material changes, will&#13;
substantially reduced total pollutant loads. Wastewater flows will drop from 540 m /hour to&#13;
117 m3/hour, with suspended solids cut by more than 50 percent; fluorine dropping from&#13;
19.8 tons/year-to 7.1 tons/year; and phosphorus from 57 to 18.5 tons/year. The addition of&#13;
secondary treatment of that residual stream will further cut all of the above pollutants, with&#13;
phosphorus dropping below 1 ton/year.&#13;
9.    To achieve the above goal, the factory will switch from pyrite-based sulfuric acid&#13;
production to the use of imported sulfur as a raw material. This will eliminate the waste&#13;
slag, which itself caused pollution through rainfall runoff leaching out toxic materials and&#13;
will allow a water recirculation system that requires only 34 m3/hour in replacement water,&#13;
compared to the 193 m3/hour now needed. The concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in&#13;
waste gas will also drop from 500 ppm to 350 ppm, due to the purer raw material.&#13;
10.   In another move, the factory will cease production of calcium phosphate and&#13;
magnesium phosphate, increasing production of a variety of refined phosphate products&#13;
used in the food industry. The former production line discharges about 60 m3/hour of&#13;
wastewater and 4 tons/hour of sludge, both of which will end with the new products. The&#13;
factory already has experience producing and marketing refined phosphate for the food&#13;
industry, and these higher value-added products will contribute to increased firm&#13;
profitability.&#13;
11.   The double superphosphate production line will be overhauled, replacing corroded&#13;
equipment, shifting to cooling technologies that minimize the chance for pollution of the&#13;
cooling water, and adding a closed water system that allows recapture of phosphorus in the&#13;
washing water. The totality of these measures will reduce wastewater discharge by an&#13;
additional 170 m3/hour. Similar renovation and upgrading, to include separation of cooling&#13;
and process water streams, will reduce discharge and pollution in the yellow phosphorus&#13;
line.&#13;
12.   The remaining wastewater will discharge to a treatment plant optimized for removal&#13;
of the constituents of the plant waste stream. A full description of the process may be found&#13;
in the project files.&#13;
13.   The above technical transformation will not only radically reduce the pollutant load&#13;
from the plant, it will also improve its profitability. The key to that improvement lies not in&#13;
the pollution reduction per se-for the factory has not, heretofore, been charged the full&#13;
pollution levy fee for its polluting output. Rather, the ability to shift to a higher value&#13;
product mix, through the food phosphate market not subject to government price controls,&#13;
will produce that result.&#13;
14.   As the above description suggests, the current plant has suffered from neglected&#13;
routine maintenance, which is crucial to pollution control. Plant managers recognize this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

failing and have launched a campaign to reduce pollution in 1996 by 20 percent through&#13;
improved housekeeping. To assist in that effort, the plant has requested that the loan&#13;
include technical assistance in operation and maintenance of their renovated facilities,&#13;
including the wastewater treatment plant&#13;
15.   Major portions of the proposed investment promise no financial return for the plant,&#13;
but do offer major environmental gains. The financial internal rate of return (IRR) of the&#13;
combined investment totals 9.6%, assuming that the plant operates 300 days a year (83&#13;
percent utilization). Actual utilization currently reaches 330 days per year. The results are&#13;
robust to utilization (or sales) charges, with 60 percent utilization (216 days) yielding a 7&#13;
percent IRR. The debt service coverage ratio is a key indication for pollution abatement&#13;
projects of this type, and remains above 1.4 under all scenarios but the 60 percent utilization&#13;
case, where it would fall to 1.3 for a single year.&#13;
Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Factory&#13;
16.   Kunming Chemical Fertilizer contributes 36 tons per year of phosphorus to Dianchi,&#13;
approximately 90 percent of that in soluble, or available, form. The plant produces a variety&#13;
of fertilizers, including NPK granular fertilizer and monoammonium phosphate (MAP). As&#13;
in Kunyang, current production processes do not maximize water reuse, wastewater&#13;
treatment cannot meet flow requirements, and obsolete equipment with high breakdown&#13;
rates leads to frequent unplanned discharges of process water. The proposed project would&#13;
rebuild much of the plant to maximize water reuse and minimize pollution, leading to&#13;
smaller, more easily handled wastewater streams. Those wastewater streams would then&#13;
undergo improved treatment from that currently used.&#13;
17.   As with Kunyang, the renovation strategy relies on replacing corroded and obsolete&#13;
equipment, separating process water from cooling water, and where possible, reusing&#13;
process water after recovery of constituent chemicals. Wastewater minimization alone will&#13;
reduce wastewater discharges from 550 m3/hour to 59 m3/hour, and in the process reduce&#13;
suspended solid loads from 217 to 85 tons/year, phosphorus from 36 to 3.5 tons/year, and&#13;
NH3-N from 332 to 85 tons/year. Treatment of that wastewater stream will further reduce&#13;
suspended solids to 21 tons/year, phosphorus to less than 0.5 tons/year, and NH3-N to&#13;
I 1 tons/year.&#13;
18.   The ammonia production line desulfurization will switch from a liquid-phase&#13;
catalysis method to a tannin-based method that will eliminate 30 m /hour of a high&#13;
ammonia wastewater stream and suspended sulfur will be recovered, the cooling water will&#13;
be changed to an isolated, closed system, the cooling system redesigned for greater&#13;
efficiency, and corroded equipment replaced. The phosphoric acid and MAP workshops&#13;
will replace corroded equipment and add agitators to tanks to decrease precipitation and&#13;
thus the need to wash the tanks. In addition, the gypsum storage site will to redesigned to&#13;
minimize and capture leachate.&#13;
19.   A sulfuric acid production facility, using sulfur as a raw material, will be set up to&#13;
end the need to purchase sulfuric acid on the market. Intermittent availability of sulfliric&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-157 -                      ANNEX 12&#13;
acid has forced the MAP production line itself to run intermittently, in the last year at only&#13;
about 25 percent of capacity. With every shutdown of that line, the equipment must be&#13;
washed and pipes flushed, resulting in substantial unplanned waste loads that cannot be&#13;
handled by the current treatment plant. The sulfuric acid plant will be designed to the&#13;
improved standard to be used in Kunyang, hence pollution from that source can be&#13;
minimized.&#13;
20.   As in Kunyang, the remaining wastewater will discharge to a treatment plant&#13;
optimized for removal of the constituents of the plant waste stream. A full description of&#13;
the process may be found in the project files. Kunming has requested loan support for a&#13;
two-year technical assistance program in operation and maintenance of their new and&#13;
renovated plant and equipment. This will help plant managers realize their goal of cleaner&#13;
production and sustainable gains from the investment.&#13;
21.   The above technical transformation will not only radically reduce the pollutant load&#13;
from the plant, it will also improve its profitability. For Kunming Chemical Fertilizer, the&#13;
key to profitability lies in the new sulfuric acid plant, which will provide a reliable and less&#13;
expensive sulfuric acid supply to support normal production in the MAP facility. The&#13;
sulfuric acid plant will also produce a surplus that can be sold into a market free of&#13;
government price controls.&#13;
22.   The proposed investment will allow a substantial increase in the utilization of&#13;
existing plant and equipment, and for that reason produces a high internal rate of return&#13;
(IRR) of 93 percent at the base utilization rate of 83 percent (300 days/year). The results are&#13;
robust to utilization or sales charges, still reaching 26 percent if utilization falls to 60&#13;
percent. Similarly, substantial increases in input prices can be absorbed. The projected&#13;
debt service ratio remains above 1.4 under the tested utilization rates and price changes.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CONTROL&#13;
23.   In addition to the two major contributors to Dianchi Lake pollution that will be&#13;
addressed directly through the project, a large number of other polluters also need technical&#13;
and financial assistance to bring their discharges within the permitted loads. As one means&#13;
of providing such assistance, a 1982 Chinese environmental law provided for the&#13;
establishment of provincial, municipal, and county environment funds financed by pollution&#13;
fees. These originally provided subsidies and grants for pollution reduction investments in&#13;
industrial and municipal pollution reduction projects, and for EPB environmental&#13;
monitoring and enforcement. A 1988 amendment to the law stipulated that up to 30 percent&#13;
of the fund income was to be loaned, rather than granted, to enterprises. Bank Group-&#13;
financed projects in Hubei, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Tianjin, Zhejiang, and the Medium-Sized&#13;
Cities project, have supported improved environmental fund project identification and&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-158 -                      ANNEX 12&#13;
Pollution Fee Collection and Use in Yunnan Province&#13;
24.   In Yunnan, municipal and county EPBs collect pollution levy fees, while the&#13;
provincial, municipal and county EPBs jointly plan fee collection and utilization. The&#13;
finance bureau at each level of government holds the revenue collected, and disburses it via&#13;
local branches of the People's Construction Bank of China according to a fund allocation&#13;
plan provided by the EPBs.&#13;
25.   Fee rates have been established for wastewater discharges, waste gas emissions,&#13;
solid waste dumping and noise pollution. Fee collections rose from Y 38 million in 1992 to&#13;
over Y 52 million in 1994, with over 70 percent of the collected fees used for industrial&#13;
pollution control and the remainder financing the EPBs' environmental monitoring and&#13;
enforcement work. Had all fees been collected to stipulated levels, actual collections would&#13;
have been much higher. A total of 4,815 industries paid fees in 1994, with the top 100&#13;
polluters paying about 40 percent of all levies collected, but even the top polluters pay only&#13;
about half of what the regulations stipulate. Township and village industries pay an even&#13;
smaller proportion of theoretical levies. The relatively low collection rates are common&#13;
across China, for Yunnan shares with other provinces a reluctance to shut down highly&#13;
polluting but marginally profitable, or even loss-making, enterprises.  Instead, local&#13;
governments seek production and marketing opportunities for these plants designed to both&#13;
restore their profitability and cut pollution. Such opportunities exist, as shown with the&#13;
fertilizer plants. The environment funds provide a source of capital for other such&#13;
investments.&#13;
26.   Bank Experience in China with Environmental Funds. China still has limited&#13;
experience with environmental loan funds.  The Bank Group has supported the&#13;
establishment of such funds under six different projects and three of them have been in&#13;
operation for at least one year. Compared to domestically financed funds, the Bank Group-&#13;
assisted funds have been found to have the following advantages:&#13;
(a)   they typically provide a stronger framework for management, including&#13;
organization, staffing and operation regulations, and consciously seek links&#13;
with other environmental protection management measures such as the&#13;
promotion of pollution prevention programs;&#13;
(b)   they institute rigorous requirements and procedures for project preparation&#13;
and appraisal, ensuring a higher project success rate; and&#13;
(c)   they train staff of the fund offices in the technical and financial areas.&#13;
27.   One disadvantage of Bank-supported funds is that the more rigorous appraisal&#13;
procedures have been expensive compared to the size of the typical loan, which has been&#13;
under $1 million. Due regard needs to be given to modifications of the appraisal procedures&#13;
to bring down costs while maintaining quality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-159 -                      ANNEX 12&#13;
Environmental Pollution Control Subloans&#13;
28.   The purpose of EPCSL is to strengthen the existing Yunnan pollution prevention&#13;
program with a technically and institutionally sustainable financing mechanism. The&#13;
subloans would primarily assist small-scale industrial enterprises within the Dianchi basin&#13;
to control pollution through waste minimization measures, modifications or renovations to&#13;
existing plants to reduce waste outputs, or to recycle waste generated during production.&#13;
Industrial upgrading projects designed to reduce the amount of pollutant discharge and to&#13;
save natural resources and energy, commercial waste recovery services and centralized&#13;
treatment plants would also be considered by the Fund. The Yunnan Environmental&#13;
Protection Bureau (YEPB) has identified a priority list of Dianchi basin enterprises, and&#13;
others among the 100 most polluting enterprises, to receive preferential access to EPCSL.&#13;
29.   Organization and Financing of EPCSL. EPCSL would be a self-accounting&#13;
government facility, with initial capital equivalent of Y 84 million. The Bank Loan/IDA&#13;
Credit would provide $5 million and Yunnan Province would contribute an equivalent sum&#13;
(no less than Y 14 million for each of the first three years). While the size of the Bank/IDA&#13;
contribution has been kept small, the justification for Bank/IDA support for the facility&#13;
derives from, first, the advantages listed above.&#13;
30.   YPG has designated the Yunnan Finance Bureau (YFB) to administer EPCSL.&#13;
YEPB has prepared draft operations regulations for EPCSL, setting out the criteria for&#13;
subloans processing and approvals, the rules and regulations for management, and defining&#13;
the terms and conditions for loans. Disbursement against this component can begin only&#13;
after selection of a domestic bank (agent bank) to act as the agent in handling loan funds&#13;
and the signing of an agreement, acceptable to the Bank/IDA, between that domestic bank&#13;
and YP, laying out the agency agreement. The EPCSL Steering Committee would&#13;
determine the institutional structure and staff composition of the EPCSL Management&#13;
Office and approve its annual work plan and budget.&#13;
31.   The EPCSL Fund Management Office (SLMO) would have up to 6 staff, to be&#13;
recruited during a three-year period, including specialists in environmental science and&#13;
technology, industrial processing, economics and finance, and administration. The director&#13;
would be appointed by the Steering Committee, and other staff would be locally recruited.&#13;
The main role of SLMO would be in investment project planning, coordination between&#13;
borrower and agent bank, review of project feasibility and supervision of project&#13;
implementation. Financial appraisal will be handled within SLMO, while technical&#13;
appraisal will rely on consultants for industry-specific expertise.&#13;
32.   Project Selection. Each application would be first reviewed by the local industrial&#13;
bureau and planning commission, and approved by the concerned local EPB to ensure&#13;
consistency with the municipal environmental planning. On that basis, YEPB will lead an&#13;
appraisal that looks particularly at the appropriateness of the investment, given available&#13;
technology and the input and output markets; the quality of enterprise management as&#13;
demonstrated in their current operating environment; the suitability of the pollution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

abatement measures proposed to the effluents produced in the enterprise; and the design of&#13;
easily maintained and operated systems well within the technical competence of enterprise&#13;
personnel.&#13;
Project Management Procedures&#13;
33.   EPCSL operating procedures will include the following:&#13;
(a)   The SLMO would issue directives and solicitations for project proposals to&#13;
the priority area EPBs and planning commissions;&#13;
(b)   With consent from the local industrial bureau, the enterprise would submit a&#13;
loan application to its EPB and planning commission;&#13;
(c)   With EPB and planning commission concurrence, the enterprise would&#13;
prepare a feasibility study report, including a financial proposal for&#13;
investment and an environmental impact assessment;&#13;
(d)   After the project has been successfully appraised, SLMO would submit the&#13;
appraisal report and proposed loan conditions to the World Bank Group for&#13;
no-objection. The Bank/IDA would provide ex-ante review of the first three&#13;
subloan projects and thereafter each subloan of over $300,000, with all other&#13;
subloans subject to ex-post review;&#13;
(e)   The EPCSL Steering Committee would be responsible for the final approval&#13;
of subloan projects. After approval, SLMO would confirm the loan to the&#13;
enterprise, any cofinancing agencies and the agent bank;&#13;
(f)   SLMO would supervise the implementation of the project;&#13;
(g)   After satisfying itself as to the quality of a commissioned project, the&#13;
relevant bureau would issue a Certificate of Examination and Acceptance to&#13;
the enterprise;&#13;
(h)   The bureau in charge would submit examination and acceptance documents&#13;
for the project to SLMO; and&#13;
(i)   SLMO would separately assess whether the project meets the design&#13;
document requirements. If it does not, SLMO would arrange for appropriate&#13;
departments to intervene, seeking necessary amendments to the project.&#13;
Project Appraisal&#13;
34.   For the technical appraisal of individual projects, the general criteria to be&#13;
considered are: (a) the project's impact on the ambient environrent; (b) compliance with&#13;
environmental regulations and standards; and (c) technical feasibility and identification of&#13;
the least-cost option.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-161-                      ANNEX 12&#13;
35.   The economic appraisal must show that the enterprise is economically viable.&#13;
36.   The financial appraisal must demonstrate that the enterprise, as a whole, would be&#13;
financially viable, including meeting a debt service ratio larger than 1.4 after the proposed&#13;
project reaches full production capacity. For joint waste treatment facilities, a financing&#13;
plan for the operation and maintenance of the facility would be required.&#13;
Project Financing Procedures Between Agent Bank and Borrower&#13;
37.   Once a subloan application is approved by the EPCSL Steering Conmnittee, the&#13;
agent bank would execute the loan according to procedures described below:&#13;
(a)   The agent would confirm the project financing plan with the borrower, in&#13;
accordance with the loan agreement signed between Yunnan Province (YP)&#13;
and the enterprise;&#13;
(b)   The project unit would open an account with the agent;&#13;
(c)   The agent would disburse funds upon receipt of statement of expenditure, in&#13;
the form of invoice or letter of credit. Normally, disbursement would be&#13;
made once a month;&#13;
(d)   The agent would supervise the fund's use by the project unit. If project&#13;
funds are found to have been used for any purpose other than the approved&#13;
project, the agent would refuse further disbursement and notify SLMO;&#13;
(e)   The agent would report to YFB quarterly on the financial status of loans&#13;
made to borrowers. The agent would also report emerging issues and make&#13;
suggestions for improvement as needed;&#13;
(f)   At project completion, the agent would finalize the financial accounting;&#13;
(g)   If projects fail to meet project date or design criteria, the agent shall notify&#13;
SLMO; and&#13;
(h)   The agent would assist SLMO in the collection of loan principal, interest,&#13;
late payment penalties and fines.&#13;
Disbursement would be made through the agent from the account for EPCSL in the Yunnan&#13;
Finance Bureau. EPCSL would be audited annually, to include a management letter.&#13;
Loans&#13;
38.   The loan for any project would be limited to 100 percent of foreign exchange costs,&#13;
or 50 percent of total project costs (excluding land), whichever is higher. Total project size&#13;
would not normally exceed $1 million. Loan maturity would be three to five years, with up&#13;
to two years of grace. YFB would bear the subloan credit risk, and the enterprise the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-162 -                     ANNEX 12&#13;
foreign exchange risk. The subloan interest rate would be no less than the standard interest&#13;
rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans plus a spread of 1.5 percent per year&#13;
and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent. Repayments to EPCSL would be recycled for&#13;
additional subprojects to the extent funds are not needed for repayment of the Bank/IDA&#13;
loan.&#13;
Institutional Development and Equipment Needs&#13;
39.   The Subloans Management Office personnel would undergo an extensive training&#13;
program.  Training courses would include economic and financial analysis, waste&#13;
management, waste reduction technology, particularly resource recovery/recycling and&#13;
clean technology. Training and equipment for EPCSL will be partly financed under&#13;
Package H of the technical assistance schedule.&#13;
ACTION PLANS FOR INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION CONTROL&#13;
40.   Two major polluters within the Dianchi Basin, the Yunfeng Paper Mill and&#13;
Kunming Steel General Company, have identified funding sources apart from the&#13;
Bank/IDA loan and have agreed that their pollution abatement action plans be incorporated&#13;
within the scope of the project. A third polluter, the Kunming Agricultural Chemical&#13;
Factory, also has abatement plans, but has yet to identify funding sources for them. In view&#13;
of the possible impact of this plant on the municipal wastewater investments, the municipal&#13;
government has undertaken to close or move the plant within three years by not later than&#13;
June 30, 1999. Copies of all three plans are available in the project files, while those of&#13;
Yunfeng and Kunming Steel are summarized below.&#13;
41.   The Yunfeng Paper Mill currently discharges black liquor from the pulp cooking&#13;
section, with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of about 18,000 mg/l to a&#13;
storage pond, from which it is flushed during the rainy season. The wastewater from pulp&#13;
washing and from the paper coating workshop discharges directly to the Tanglangchuan.&#13;
Yunfeng's planned investments would recover much of the alkali from the black liquor,&#13;
reducing total pollution loads and easing treatment. An expanded treatment plant would&#13;
treat the remaining wash water currently discharging directly to the river. In this fashion,&#13;
removal rates of COD, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and suspended solids would all&#13;
increase by 80 percent or more compared to the current situation.&#13;
42.   The Kunring Steel General Company currently discharges an array of toxic and&#13;
other pollutants, including 10 tons of cyanide, over 20 tons of phenol and 350 tons of oil&#13;
into the Tanglangchuan. Although this represents a substantial decrease over 20 years ago,&#13;
the plant uses (and then discharges as wastewater) almost the entire flow of the&#13;
Tanglangchuan during the dry season. To meet water needs for increased production, they&#13;
plan to move to very high levels of water recycling, and for that need to reduce pollutant&#13;
concentrations in their wastewater. Their strategy is to separate the various water streams,&#13;
allowing immediate reuse of cooling water. Other water will pass through one of two new&#13;
wastewater treatment plants before reuse. The company estimates that overall recycling&#13;
rates can climb from the current 29 percent to over 80 percent.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 13: MUNICIPAL FINANCES&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
1.    The assumptions made when calculating the projections of the on-budget revenue&#13;
and expenditure statements of (a) Yunnan Province; (b) Honghe and Qujing Prefectures;&#13;
(c) Gejiu, Kunming and Qujing Municipalities; and (d) Chenggong and Jinnin Counties, for&#13;
the period 1995-2002 are set out below. On-budget revenues are those arising from taxes&#13;
levied on enterprises operating in the these areas; off-budget revenues consist of special fees&#13;
to enterprises and are used chiefly for capital expenditures.&#13;
Revenue Forecast&#13;
2.    The actual (1992-94) on-budget revenue figures have been derived from data&#13;
provided by the provincial, prefectural, municipal and county governments. Between 1992&#13;
and 1994, the average annual increase in revenue was between 21 and 68 percent in current&#13;
terms, except for Qujing Prefecture, where there was a decrease of 9 percent. In 1994, the&#13;
Central Government restructured the tax system, bolstering its share. As a result, there were&#13;
marginal declines in revenue in 1994 from 1993, except for Qujing Municipality, Honghe&#13;
Prefecture and Chenggong County which posted gains of between 4 and 38 percent. To&#13;
estimate future revenues, an overall average annual increase of about 10 percent in real&#13;
terms has been assumed using 1994 as the base year.&#13;
Expenditure Forecast&#13;
3.    Historically, on-budget expenditures have registered between 98 to 100 percent of&#13;
on-budget revenues. There was little change in that ratio in 1994 when the tax system was&#13;
restructured (para. 2), except in Qujing Municipality and Prefecture, and Chenggong and&#13;
Jinnin Counties where expenditures rose marginally as a percent of 1994 revenues. To&#13;
estimate future expenditures, the ratio of expenditures to revenues is assumed to be&#13;
generally between 75 to 100 percent of revenues.&#13;
4.    The following tables summarize projected revenue and expenditure data from 1995&#13;
to 2002 for the Municipalities of Gejiu, Kunring and Qujing, the main beneficiaries of&#13;
project investments, and Yunnan Province.  Projected project expenditures are also&#13;
included.&#13;

ANNEX 14: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
A. WATER SUPPLY COMPANIES&#13;
1.    Assumptions to the projections of the main financial statements of the Kunming&#13;
Water Supply Company (KWSC) and the water supply division of Qujing Water Supply&#13;
and Drainage Company (QWSDC) for the period 1993-2002 are provided below.&#13;
2.    Inflation and Exchange Rates. Yearly general domestic inflation rates used in the&#13;
projections are, 10.6 percent in 1996, 8.5 percent in 1997, 7.0 percent in 1998, 6.5 percent&#13;
in 1999, and 6.2 percent in percent in 2000-02. Foreign price increases are estimated at&#13;
2.4 percent for each of years 1995-2002. The exchange rate used to convert foreign costs to&#13;
local currency, where applicable, was Y 8.3 per $1.0. It is assumed that exchange rate&#13;
adjustments would, on average, maintain purchasing power parity over the projection&#13;
period.&#13;
Income Statement&#13;
3.    Water Sales. Projections of sales are based on "minimum demand" and maximum&#13;
capacity figures. Unaccounted-for-water is estimated at 12 percent of production. It is&#13;
assumed that whenever demand exceeds supply, the shortfall would be borne by both the&#13;
domestic and nondomestic categories of consumers, proportionally.&#13;
4.    Average Tariffs. The average prices in yuan per m in current terms are as follows:&#13;
1996     1997      1998      1999     2000      2001      2002&#13;
Kunming       0.59     0.59      0.59      0.67     0.72      0.76      0.81&#13;
Qujing        0.77     0.93      1.16      1.23      1.31     1.39      1.48&#13;
5.    Tariffs. The current domestic, commercial and industrial tariffs in Gejiu are&#13;
Y 0.60/m3, Y 0.80 m3 and Y 1.00/m3 respectively. They were introduced in August 1995&#13;
replacing the previous tariffs of Y 0.49/m3, Y 0.69/m  and Y 0.89/m3. The domestic,&#13;
industrial and commercial, construction, and foreign hotels tariffs in effect in Kunming&#13;
since January 1, 1996 are Y 0.60 m/?, Y 0.76/m3, Y 1.10/Im3 and Y 1.50 m3, respectively.&#13;
The domestic tariff in Qujing is Y 0.80/m3, rising from Y 0.60/m3 introduced in February&#13;
1994. The industrial/commercial, foreign hotels and construction tariffs in Qujing are&#13;
Y l.10/m3, Y 1.65/mi3 and Y1.50/m3, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6.    Operating Costs. Salaries and wages are assumed to increase at the rates given in&#13;
para. 2 above. Energy prices are assumed to increase in line with general inflation.&#13;
Materials and other costs are assumed to increase at the general inflation rate. Composite&#13;
depreciation rates of 5.0 percent and 6.7 percent have been applied for Kunming and Qujing&#13;
respectively. A Municipal Public Facility Supplementary Tax, Value Added Taxes (VAT),&#13;
an urban construction and maintenance surtax and an education surtax totaling 13.3 percent&#13;
are charged on gross operating revenue in Kunming. VAT, including an urban construction&#13;
and maintenance surtax, and an education surtax, totaling 14.3 percent are charged on gross&#13;
operating revenue in Qujing. Income taxes of 33 percent apply in both Kunming and&#13;
Qujing.&#13;
7.    Interest and Amortization Expenses. The proceeds of the IBRD loan and IDA&#13;
credit are assumed to be onlent by the Kunming and Qujing Municipal Governments to&#13;
KWSC and QWSDC at the standard rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans&#13;
(5.76 percent per year at the time of appraisal), and 0.75 percent per year commitment&#13;
charge, over 15 years, including 5 years of grace. Interest is paid annually. Amortization of&#13;
loans would be on the basis of equal payments of principal. KWSC and QWSDC would&#13;
bear the foreign exchange risk. The municipalities would provide the local capital&#13;
counterpart funds as capital grants.&#13;
Balance Sheet&#13;
8.   Inventories. Inventories have been projected to take into account general inflation&#13;
as well as any expanded levels of operations and construction.&#13;
9.    Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable from water sales are assumed to be&#13;
25 days' revenue.&#13;
10.   Fixed Assets.  Fixed assets are valued at historic costs. In the projections,&#13;
construction work-in progress is assumed to be 100 percent accounted for upon completion.&#13;
Source and Application of Funds&#13;
11.   Working Capital Needs. Working capital needs represent the excess, or otherwise,&#13;
of the current year's current assets (net of cash), less the excess of the previous year's&#13;
current assets (net of cash) over current liabilities.&#13;
12.   Change in Cash.  Change in cash (which includes short-term  investments)&#13;
calculates the balance sheet cash balance for the current year.&#13;
B. WASTEWATER COMPANIES&#13;
13.   Assumptions to the projections of the main financial statements of Kunming&#13;
Drainage Company (KDC) and the wastewater units of Gejiu Water Supply and Drainage&#13;

ANNEX 15: ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
A. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
1.    The Bank Group highlighted enhancing environmental protection and alleviating&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks as two of the four areas of concentration under the China&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board in June 1995. The Bank&#13;
Group's close collaboration with the Chinese government covers both the regulatory and&#13;
service provision  aspects of urban  environmental management.   The China:&#13;
Environmental Strategy Paper sector study led to an Environmental Technical Assistance&#13;
Project that assists NEPA in its efforts to find more efficient regulatory methods, improve&#13;
staff capabilities and bolster environmental monitoring. In addition to national regulatory&#13;
assistance, the Bank Group is currently involved in six urban environmental projects in&#13;
12 cities, which incorporate policy, financing and organizational strategies for improved&#13;
environmental regulation and service delivery at the provincial and municipal levels.&#13;
Another four ongoing projects involving 12 cities include related issues such as&#13;
municipal water supply and sanitation needs. The initial round of projects focused on&#13;
China's largest cities-Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin-and those located primarily in the&#13;
wealthier northeast and coastal provinces. Environmental pressures remain very high in&#13;
those areas and cooperation will continue, as with the recently appraised Second&#13;
Shanghai Sewerage Project and the Shandong Environment Project now being prepared.&#13;
While the recently approved Hubei Urban Environmental Project marks a shift toward&#13;
inland and medium-income areas in central China, the Yunnan Environment Project (and&#13;
that in Guangxi Province) further test the feasibility of policy and institutional solutions&#13;
in poorer provinces.&#13;
2.    Bankwide municipal management sector work (Urban Service Delivery: Finding&#13;
the Right Incentives) emphasizes the need properly to assign functional responsibilities&#13;
and link revenue to expenditures.  In China's case, environmental services are&#13;
appropriately provided at the municipal level, where a high percentage of government&#13;
revenue is also captured. China: Urban Environmental Service Management concludes&#13;
that the major failing in environmental services has been dependence on municipal&#13;
budget transfers to fund services, while greater reliance on user charges would be&#13;
affordable, induce resource conservation and create a more dependable income stream.&#13;
For that reason, increasing tariffs has been a major focal point of the policy dialogue in&#13;
this project. This responds, too, to a major finding in the OED review of Bank water and&#13;
sanitation projects (Water Supply and Sanitation Projects: The Bank Experience 1967-&#13;
1989), wherein physical performance was generally good, but sustaining financial&#13;
viability and overall sectoral development was less successful. Adequate sector revenues&#13;
have been so crucial to successful operation of these investments that the Bank now sees&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-175-                      ANNEX15&#13;
the needed tariff structures as the major sign of municipal commitment and therefore asks&#13;
for initial adjustments to be made during project processing. The proposed project&#13;
follows this model.&#13;
3.    This project thus responds to Bank sector work and sector experience and CAS&#13;
objectives, first through an improved regulatory environment, reduction of current&#13;
pollution loads and protection of critical water resources and second through&#13;
commercialization of operating agencies and improved tariff policy and operating&#13;
techniques. The Bank's strategy flows from and supports China's Environmental Action&#13;
Plan and Agenda 21, which provides the basis for joint Government and Bank action in&#13;
the environmental sector, especially in regard to the urban environment. Finally, .the&#13;
provincial focus recognizes the effective decentralization of regulatory and investment&#13;
authority in China, and draws on local political power and commitment to induce wider&#13;
use of the solutions demonstrated under the project.&#13;
4.    This project supports provincial efforts to reduce pollution within the province,&#13;
especially within densely populated urban areas, through improving environmental&#13;
regulation and providing new models for the efficient organization, and financing of&#13;
urban environmental services and for industrial pollution control.  Specifically, the&#13;
project would support:&#13;
(a)   the more aggressive use of user fees to shift the burden of pollution&#13;
abatement to the polluter and induce waste minimization, and new&#13;
organizational forms for wastewater providers to allow improved&#13;
management tools and to help minimize the cost of abatement;&#13;
(b)   expansion of sewerage services, to reduce water pollution, within the&#13;
boundaries of Gejiu, Kunming and Qujing, and thus protect the urban&#13;
environment and the health of their people and those living downstream of&#13;
these cities;&#13;
(c)   improvements to water supply in the cities of Kunming and Qujing, to&#13;
improve the quality of supply and meet the needs of growing urban&#13;
populations;&#13;
(d)   the first municipal solid waste landfills meeting national standards in the&#13;
cities of Kunming and Qujing with consequent protection of local land and&#13;
water resources and flaring of landfill methane to reduce greenhouse gas&#13;
emissions and an improvement in solid waste collection and transfer;&#13;
(e)   abatement of two major industrial point sources of pollution affecting&#13;
Lake Dianchi in Kunming and an industrial pollution control revolving&#13;
fund to address less costly pollution abatement efforts and provide a model&#13;
for other such funds; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-176 -                     ANNEX 15&#13;
(f)   the provincial and municipal EPBs in their efforts to implement more&#13;
effective regulatory instruments.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
5.    Project formulation across three cities and a large number of sectors presented a&#13;
major analytical challenge. Ideally, the allocation of investment should be based on&#13;
maximizing the net present value while fully incorporating environmental externalities.&#13;
This involves estimating the environmental damnage reduction that would result from a&#13;
wide range of possible interventions. Yet current methodologies do not allow quick or&#13;
inexpensive, but high confidence, estimates of the impact of interventions across such a&#13;
broad choice set. Early economic analysis suggested that investment in wastewater&#13;
treatment in the Lake Dianchi Basin would yield substantial returns in terms of averting&#13;
or postponing costly future investments in water supply. Project formulation therefore&#13;
concentrated on identifying projects that would meet this need in a least-cost way,&#13;
thereby maximizing their net present value.&#13;
6.    Also, during project identification, it became clear that Yunnan and its cities&#13;
needed substantial change in policy and institutional structures along the lines described&#13;
in the sector work reported in Chapter 1 (China:  Urban Environmental Service&#13;
Management). Policy problems included urban environmental services priced too low to&#13;
discourage waste generation or provide the financing needed to build, maintain and&#13;
operate services such as water supply and wastewater collection and treatment.&#13;
Governnent bureaus providing the services lacked the financial tools to develop effective&#13;
tariff strategies or the operating autonomy needed to encourage managerial innovation.&#13;
Gaps in environmental regulation and enforcement were also apparent. Therefore,&#13;
investment choices were made with a view toward maximizing the impact of policy and&#13;
institutional innovation within the province.&#13;
7.    Specific investment choices within sectors and cities responded to long-run&#13;
municipal government strategies to bring ambient environmental quality or service&#13;
standards up to national guidelines. In the case of augmented water supply in Kunming,&#13;
and the avoided damage to Kunming's water supply, explicit benefit analysis was&#13;
possible and undertaken. In Kunming, the fact that all wastewater discharges into Lake&#13;
Dianchi, which also serves as a primary water source for the city, permits a benefit&#13;
estimate to be made at a reasonably high degree of confidence. In that case, the cost of&#13;
doing nothing different from current practice will have an impact on lake water quality&#13;
that forces increased treatment costs and an early shift to new, and more expensive water&#13;
sources. Those costs serve as a proxy for part of the pollution damage and the proposed&#13;
investment to avert them cost far less than the damage. There are also adverse aesthetic,&#13;
health and production impacts that are additional to the increased water supply costs but&#13;
are very difficult to quantify with a similar degree of accuracy. The benefit estimates in&#13;
terms of averted costs are therefore biased downwards from true benefits. For the&#13;
wastewater investments in Qujing and Gejiu and the solid waste handling and treatment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-177-                       ANNEX15&#13;
investments in Kunming and Qujing, least-cost analysis to meet specified standards was&#13;
used. Based on that analysis, city leaders made investment decisions.&#13;
City and Sector Choices&#13;
8.    In urban environmental service provision, cities were included in the project based&#13;
on the size of the population potentially benefiting from improved services and&#13;
considering their value as models to other provincial cities. Yunnan has one very large&#13;
city, Kunming, with an urban population of some 1.2 million, and 10 smaller cities, the&#13;
largest of which is Gejiu with 215,000 people. After reviewing the potential investments&#13;
in some five provincial cities, three were selected for further project development.&#13;
Kunming was given the top ranking because of its size and the major water quality and&#13;
supply problems it faces. The other two cities are Qujing and Gejiu, which are of a size&#13;
and economic strength akin to most Yunnan cities and their experience under the project&#13;
will therefore be more readily transferred than that of Kunming.  The province&#13;
established a leading group headed by a vice-governor with members from the&#13;
environmental protection, planning and finance bureaus at the provincial and/or&#13;
municipal level, to review the existing situation and guide any decisions needed on scope&#13;
or administrative arrangements.&#13;
9.    Each of the selected cities had already prepared environmental improvement plans&#13;
that outlined priority service needs, both in terms of the type of service and area of the&#13;
city needing service. The plans highlighted the relative lack of sewerage and sewage&#13;
treatment within urban areas, with household and industrial wastewater discharging to&#13;
rivers and lakes rather than to sewer systems and treatment works, and the absence of&#13;
sanitary landfill sites for the safe disposal of solid waste and nightsoil. Further work has&#13;
confirmed the choice to extend sewerage systems and ensure treatment and to build&#13;
sanitary landfills as the next step in environmental protection. Additional water supply&#13;
needs had also to be met if growing urban populations were to have access to safe water&#13;
and further commercial and industrial investments be supported.&#13;
10.   The strategy for industrial pollution control builds on national and provincial&#13;
emissions control law and regulations. The change to "total load control" in 1996&#13;
represents a positive response by NEPA and the EPBs to the problems that can occur with&#13;
a concentration-based emission control system. For enterprises built before polluting&#13;
effluents were regulated, cash flow alone rarely meets the financing needs of process&#13;
changes or end-of-pipe treatment that will allow compliance with current effluent&#13;
standards. Pollution abatement investments must compete in China's plan-driven credit&#13;
market with investments typically offering much higher financial returns to sponsors.&#13;
Where banks are able to make loans outside of state-dictated credit plans, they seek high&#13;
and rapid return opportunities, a feature uncharacteristic of most pollution-abatement&#13;
schemes.&#13;
11.   Credit market constraints (described more fully in the China Department's 1995&#13;
Capital Market Sector Study (No. 14501-CHA) leave unexploited abatement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-178 -                        ANNEX 15&#13;
opportunities in economically and financially viable enterprises that currently have a high&#13;
pollution impact. Yunnan Province therefore sought to use part of the loan to fund such&#13;
investments. The Province agreed with the Bank on a selection process to identify the&#13;
highest-impact polluters, a process that has identified two chemical fertilizer plants for&#13;
process change investments that will increase profitability as they abate pollution. These&#13;
plants both discharge high levels of pollutants, particularly phosphorus, to Lake Dianchi,&#13;
and their cleanup is far less costly than providing municipal treatment services removing&#13;
the same mass of pollutants. To provide for such opportunities in smaller enterprises, the&#13;
province also established a pollution control loan fund, to be initially capitalized at $10&#13;
million, for which it requested Bank support. A number of industries have already made&#13;
proposals for investment in production improvements and wastewater treatment under&#13;
this fund and an appraisal process is being developed for prioritizing these investments&#13;

12.   Of the proposed investments, the solid waste will be managed by municipal&#13;
environmental sanitation sections, the water by existing municipally-owned enterprises,&#13;
the wastewater by newly-formed municipally-owned enterprises and the fertilizer plant&#13;
pollution abatement by the enterprises themselves.  In each case, the enterprises or&#13;
activities were judged unable to compete effectively for private financing at this stage in&#13;
their development, though institutional reforms under the project will help them attain&#13;
that goal in the future. None has a history of sufficiently profitable operation to attract&#13;
private financing.&#13;
13.   In the case of the water and fertilizer enterprises, the lack of profits can be&#13;
attributed to the fact that they continue to fall under a tightly-controlled output price&#13;
regime, while facing a largely deregulated input market. The fertilizer enterprises will&#13;
shift part of their production to unregulated markets, thus partially escaping the&#13;
regulatory burden. For water, the project commits the municipalities to regulating prices&#13;
such as to allow a positive return. The wastewater enterprises were created to provide a&#13;
managerial structure facilitating efficient operation, something absent in their previous&#13;
government bureau form. For wastewater, the municipalities have committed to a price&#13;
structure that results in break-even operations. Only solid waste remains a government&#13;
bureau operation. Here, the current collection operation works sufficiently well that&#13;
emphasis was placed on providing technical assistance to cost properly the operation and&#13;
allow adequate rates for commercial, industrial and other system users. In all cases, a&#13;
project goal is to help create improved service delivery at a reduced cost.&#13;
Wastewater Collection and Treatment&#13;
14.   Kunming.  Kunming discharges all its wastewater either directly or through&#13;
sewers to the rivers and canals which flow into Lake Dianchi. These rivers and canals are&#13;
therefore grossly polluted.  Domestic and industrial pollution, erosion and land&#13;
reclamation have resulted in the lake ecosystem changing to a turbid, eutrophying water&#13;
body, the Caohai (inner lake) being more badly affected than the Waihai (outer lake). See&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-179 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
map 27911. The water quality in the lake varies by area and season, but has deteriorated&#13;
to worse than Class V over much of the year, well below the level at which it should be&#13;
used as a drinking water source. The number 3 water treatment works was closed in&#13;
October 1994, in response to the quality deterioration. Output from the number 5 works&#13;
was reduced in August, 1995 due to these same problems. Nevertheless, the Waihai&#13;
supplies up to half Kunming's water in dry years, creating very strong environmental and&#13;
health reasons why Kunming's wastewater should be treated.&#13;
15.   The Lake Dianchi water quality study identified phosphorus as the limiting&#13;
nutrient for the eutrophication of the lake. The economic analysis therefore concentrated&#13;
on investments that would control that pollutant or allow adequate treatment of the&#13;
polluted water. The economic analysis of wastewater collection and treatment programs&#13;
generally presents challenging analytical problems on the benefit side. The range of&#13;
impacts, on amenity, health and commodity production uses, can be described but usually&#13;
not easily quantified. However, in this project Kunming's Lake Dianchi water use for&#13;
municipal supply creates a condition whereby pollution damage can be modeled and&#13;
impacts quantified with a reasonable degree of confidence. The analysis is expressed in&#13;
terms of the "Do Nothing More Scenario" (DNS) which is what would happen if nothing&#13;
more was done over the next 25 years than is currently being done, i.e., no changes to&#13;
current policies, plans and institutions and no further interventions to improve water&#13;
quality beyond the two municipal treatment plants now being constructed with nonproject&#13;
funds. Lake Dianchi is a receiving lake in which pollutants will build up fairly&#13;
predictably over time and this will have inevitable consequences for water supply, the&#13;
economy and environment and amenity of the area.&#13;
16.   If nothing more is done in Kunming than currently planned there are a number of&#13;
factors that will result in substantial future investment and costs:&#13;
(a)    With rising incomes, per capita water consumption is projected under DNS&#13;
to increase by 40 percent from 180 to 250 liters/day by 2020. Industrial&#13;
demand will also rise significantly. Agricultural demand will stay fairly&#13;
constant as the irrigated area is unlikely to increase.&#13;
(b)   Predicted population growth that will increase the urban population to 2.8&#13;
million by 2020, because of which annual renewable water resources of&#13;
300 m3 per capita will decline to 195 m3 per capita by 2020, leading to a&#13;
significant and increasing water deficit whether worked out in water&#13;
balance terms or in terms of potential supply and demand flows.&#13;
(c)   Storing water from wet years and reuse of water from Lake Dianchi will&#13;
remain the main means of balancing demands until new sources of water&#13;
are found. The use of Waihai water will increase particularly in drought&#13;
years.  Total demand for water from  Lake Dianchi is currently&#13;
251 million m3 per year and is forecast to rise to 332 million m3 in 2000.&#13;
3&#13;
It has the potential to supply up to 342 million m . However, the pressures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-180 -                       ANNEX 15&#13;
on the use of Lake Dianchi water will hasten the date at which lake water&#13;
will become unusable for domestic water purposes.&#13;
(d)   The switching dates among water supply sources are further affected by&#13;
the considerable intra- and interannual variations in precipitation and&#13;
runoff and by the need to balance water supply requirements against those&#13;
of flood control.  At present the majority of the storage capacity&#13;
(100 million mi3) of Songhuaba (which has good quality water) is for flood&#13;
control purposes which forces the use of increasingly poor quality Lake&#13;
Dianchi water for municipal water supplies.&#13;
(e)    Effluent entering the lake will rise substantially. At present, more than 80&#13;
percent of Kunming's effluent enters the lake untreated. Other sources of&#13;
pollution are lakeside industry (particularly fertilizer, pulp and paper,&#13;
pesticide factories and metal smelters), lakeside townships, and runoff,&#13;
particularly from mining and fertilizers. It is estimated that currently&#13;
781 tons/year of total phosphorus (TP) enter the lake and, if nothing more&#13;
is done than currently planned, this will increase to 1,146 tons/year by&#13;
2010 (see Table 1). The sources of these loads are known in some detail&#13;
and can be forecast under the DNS.&#13;

(f)   the significant deterioration in quality of water of the Waihai over the last&#13;
10 to 15 years will continue at an accelerating rate. TP concentrations&#13;
(0.14 mg/l in 1994) have been forecast by the computer model of the&#13;
Waihai to increase to 0.30 mg/l in 2000, 0.40 mg/l in 2010 and nearly&#13;
0.50 mg/l by 2020 (see Annex 7, Figure 1). There are also significant&#13;
forecast increases in nitrate, dissolved organics and toxic heavy metals, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-181-                       ANNEX 15&#13;
phosphorus concentrations are considered to be the most significant&#13;
limiting factor for water supply because of their effect on the levels of&#13;
algae in the lake.&#13;
(g)   the Waihai is already experiencing difficulties with water treatment and&#13;
the costs of treatment will further increase. All water treatment plants&#13;
will have to install dissolved air flotation (DAF) process to remove&#13;
algae (Water Treatment Plant No 5 already has to use this process).&#13;
The practice of adding chlorine to the raw water at inlet will increase&#13;
despite the dangers of tri-halo methane (THMs).  Later, more&#13;
sophisticated filtration and purification techniques will be needed, at&#13;
much higher cost. The costs of this increased treatment are summarized&#13;
in Table 2 and details can be found on the project files.&#13;
(h)   Later on in the period, the buildup of phosphorus in the Waihai will be so&#13;
great that the water will not be suitable for industrial uses forcing&#13;
industries to install water treatment plants. Some industries are already&#13;
treating industrial water. It is not anticipated that the deterioration of the&#13;
Waihai will have any adverse effects on agriculture. It may indeed benefit&#13;
from the increased supplies and increased nutrients.&#13;
(i)    The DNS will result in all the available water in Songhuaba being used for&#13;
domestic purposes and agricultural water being pumped up from Lake&#13;
Dianchi. This process has already started and is bound to continue if there&#13;
is no effort to save the lake.&#13;

investment). Even with the diversion of water from agriculture and the&#13;
proposed investment, the reservoir will not be able to come near to&#13;
satisfying the DNS municipal water requirements without further&#13;
investments in other water sources..&#13;
(k)   From the present day to the date of importing water from another&#13;
catchment, there is a growing water deficit in the Dianchi catchment that&#13;
will inevitably result in reducing the amount of water for agriculture.&#13;
Under the DNS this will happen even if Songhuaba agricultural supplies&#13;
are completely replaced by pumping from Dianchi. The economic cost is&#13;
set out in Table 2. The result in Table 2 is most sensitive to the timing of&#13;
water augmentation from outside the catchment. If quality deterioration&#13;
slowed more than expected and that need were delayed, say, five years, the&#13;
NPV of that damage component would fall to Y 1,263 million and total&#13;
averted damage would fall to Y 2,066 million.&#13;
(I)    Water demand and supply and increasing pollution levels will dictate that,&#13;
from around 2005, Kunming will have to move to sources outside the&#13;
Dianchi and Songhuaba catchment for its main source of supply. The next&#13;
least-cost source that will satisfy DNS demands until the end of the&#13;
scenario period will involve a dramatic increase in both capital and current&#13;
costs. The source has been identified by Yunnan Water Conservancy&#13;
Bureau as the Yulong Reservoir at Zhangjiu River around 150 km from&#13;
Kunming. The conveyance (through open ditch and tunnel) and pumping&#13;
of this water and its treatment has been costed by project engineers at June&#13;
1996 prices and is entered in the DNS (Table 2).&#13;
17.   The result of doing nothing will be a very steep increase in the economic costs of&#13;
water, which will adversely affect the welfare of everyone in Kunming. Many living in&#13;
rural areas will face a continued shortage of irrigation water. Doing nothing will also&#13;
impose significant increased costs on some industries resulting in a loss of&#13;
competitiveness. The economic analysis has concentrated solely on additional water&#13;
supply costs because of their scale and ease of identification. The analysis has not&#13;
attempted to calculate other damages such as that to fisheries in the lake, health and&#13;
visual amenity or damage attributable to pollutants other than those that lead to the build&#13;
up of algae in Lake Dianchi. The wastewater project will also significantly reduce&#13;
suspended solids, heavy metals and biological oxygen demand (BOD) but it is not&#13;
possible to assess with sufficient accuracy the additional environmental damage reduction&#13;
that can be attributable to this. The damage estimate may therefore be considered as a&#13;
conservative estimate of the total amount of environmental damage that would result&#13;
from Do Nothing.&#13;
18.   The long-run objective of the Kunming wastewater project is therefore to ensure&#13;
the reduction or treatment of enough wastewater being generated in the urban area (both&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-183-                       ANNEX15&#13;
industrial and nonindustrial) to maximize the net present value (NPV) of the investment.&#13;
This will be achieved through four integrated strategies:&#13;
(a)   constructing trunk sewers;&#13;
(b)   reticulating currently unscrewed areas;&#13;
(c)   constructing sewage treatment works (STWs);&#13;
(d)   maximizing connections to the system&#13;
19.   The decision concerning which basic wastewater treatment technologies to adopt&#13;
for sewage treatment, e.g., oxidation ponds or a variety of conventional, treatment&#13;
systems, was made in favor of the latter on the basis of the excessive land requirements&#13;
and costs associated with ponds designed for the climatic conditions in Yunnan. Two key&#13;
factors compared were the number and location of STWs and the detailed selection of&#13;
processes. The location of the STWs had already been approximately fixed by the&#13;
existing Sewerage Master Plan. However, other potential locations were also identified&#13;
and analyzed. The network layout has been determined by the topography, trunk sewer&#13;
minimization, location of STWs, and existing and proposed urban development.&#13;
20.   Thus, comparison of network layouts emphasized the utilization of existing&#13;
sewers and ensuring use of the most economical pipe size. Within the city center, the key&#13;
issue lay not so much with the network arrangement, but whether to convert the existing&#13;
combined sewers into a separate system. The latter will ultimately reduce treatment costs&#13;
as STW capacities can be limited as they will only treat sewage flows and not stormwater&#13;
flows as they do at present. The construction of a separate sewer system also has&#13;
advantages in that it reduces sewer size and should minimize pumping, especially in a&#13;
region with large seasonal rainfall variations. Nightsoil is still being collected and&#13;
disposed of to land, but this is gradually being phased out as the city develops.&#13;
21.   In STW design, the key selection factor was to achieve the most cost-effective&#13;
method for phosphorus removal, the pollutant of prime concern in the Dianchi Basin.&#13;
Secondary factors include nitrogen, BOD/COD and suspended solids removal. The&#13;
processes adopted are those believed to be the most efficient in achieving the phosphorus&#13;
objective without compromising the secondary objectives. In addition, the selected&#13;
processes have the advantage of being technologies already operating in China.&#13;
Dewatered sludge will be disposed of to one of the landfill sites being developed under&#13;
YEP. The alternative of agricultural use of sludge has not been pursued due to the lack of&#13;
a market for currently produced sludge and potential difficulties with contamination, as&#13;
shown in the existing STW. As the treatment options involved the treatment of different&#13;
quantities, the optimal solution required the valuation of benefits rather than least-cost&#13;
methods. The rate of return based on the implied benefits of removing phosphorus&#13;
derived from the "Do Nothing More Scenario" (DNS) for the selected option-a three-&#13;
stage, twin-return biological treatment strategy, was 51 percent higher than the three-&#13;
stage, single-return biological treatment alternative and 18 percent higher than the five-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-184 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
stage biological treatment option. Chemically-assisted primary treatment alternatives&#13;
were considered during project development. However, they did not reduce pollution&#13;
sufficiently to maintain water quality below the danger zone for treatment.&#13;
22.   In summary, the Kunming wastewater project consists of:&#13;
(a)   two new STWs and related interceptor sewer system to serve rapidly&#13;
expanding urban areas;&#13;
(b)   upgrade and extension of an existing STW serving the city center;&#13;
(c)   interceptor sewer networks for the western area of Kunring;&#13;
(d)   city center sewer rehabilitation;&#13;
(e)   house connections;&#13;
(f)   discharge of treated effluent to rivers, canals and Lake Dianchi and sludge&#13;
to the new sanitary landfill sites.&#13;
This project will complete the construction of STWs in Kunming by providing all&#13;
drainage areas of the city with an STW.&#13;
23.   The present value over 25 years at a 12 percent discount rate of the Kunming&#13;
Wastewater Component at June 1996 prices including O&amp;M costs and M&amp;E replacement&#13;
is Y 1,163 million. It is currently forecast that YEP wastewater will maintain phosphorus&#13;
concentrations at present levels and within the limits where advanced treatment would not&#13;
be required.  However, the 95 percent confidence interval around the phosphorus&#13;
concentration estimate does cross into the danger zone for water treatment. Therefore, a&#13;
new treatment plant for the Lake is planned using advanced water treatment processes.&#13;
The treatment of Lake Dianchi water after YEP may have to use advanced processes&#13;
involving ozone and activated carbon. The cost of this has been estimated as Y 556&#13;
million in present value terms. When this cost is added to that of YEP wastewater, the&#13;
overall cost of the YEP strategy reaches Y 1,719 million. This compares very favorably&#13;
with the costs averted of Y 2,761 million (and with the low damage scenario of Y 2,066&#13;
million) and provides sound economic justification for the component.&#13;
24.   Qujing Wastewater. Qujing discharges its wastewater to the Nanpanjiang River&#13;
(headwater of the Pearl River), which also supplies industrial and agricultural water to&#13;
Qujing. Historically, the water was of sufficient quality to permit its use as a source of&#13;
potable water, but continued failure to capture and treat the city's wastewater has resulted&#13;
in serious downstream deterioration. The increasing pollution has reduced the water&#13;
quality to worse than Class V, which now limits its use even to industry and agriculture.&#13;
To achieve the stated water quality objective of Class IV for the Nanpanjiang River, full&#13;
sewage treatment would be required, so a least-cost analysis of treatment options was&#13;
carried out. Four main treatment options were considered:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-185 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
(a)   oxidation ponds,&#13;
(b)   primary settlement followed by activated sludge,&#13;
(c)   extended aeration activated sludge, and&#13;
(d)   two-stage activated sludge.&#13;
25.   Despite the low operating costs, the large land requirements of oxidation ponds,&#13;
together with costs and environmental impact of using available land, led to this option&#13;
being rejected. Of the other three variations on the activated sludge process, the least-&#13;
cost option was identified as the extended aeration activated sludge at a cost (including&#13;
the sewerage system) of some Y 185 million. An evaluation was also made of an&#13;
alternative site for the STW, 5 km farther away from the city. This would have incurred&#13;
additional cost for the longer inlet sewer and for upgrading the access road (a total&#13;
additional cost of some Y 23 million on an overall sewerage cost of Y 38 million)&#13;
without any significant benefits except a lower land cost for the STW site. It was agreed&#13;
that the Qujing Master Plan should be revised to avoid further development immediately&#13;
adjacent to the selected STW site.&#13;
26.   The option of providing two STWs, the second to serve the new Western&#13;
Development Area after about the year 2010, was also considered. The additional costs&#13;
of the sewerage and pumping required to carry the flows to one site were shown to be&#13;
outweighed by the economies of scale from a single STW. The reuse of the effluent for&#13;
agriculture also favored the location of a single STW in the agricultural area. However,&#13;
the authorities judged the overall cost of the project to be still too high. To reduce the&#13;
cost of this phase, the decision was taken to provide as extensive a sewerage system as&#13;
possible at the outset to intercept all the sewage flows reaching the rivers running through&#13;
the city but initially to lower the discharge standard (with only removal of gross solids&#13;
and some BOD) in the first phase. This could be achieved by providing a reduced level&#13;
of treatment. Although this treatment will not meet the long-run requirements, it will&#13;
nevertheless result in significant environmental quality improvements. Two options to&#13;
achieve this were identified:&#13;
(a)   the first stage of the two-stage activated sludge plant, or&#13;
(b)   enhanced primary sedimentation using chemicals.&#13;
27.   The activated sludge plant was identified as the least-cost investment. An initial&#13;
concern that it would produce an unstable sludge has been responded to by adding a&#13;
sludge conditioning tank. A preliminary analysis of enhanced primary treatment was also&#13;
made and a detailed costing prepared for two chemicals-lime and ferric chloride. Total&#13;
costs were higher than those from the activated sludge plant and this option would cost&#13;
more to move to secondary treatment. Land is being set aside for the addition of&#13;
secondary biological treatment as soon as that is affordable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-186 -                       ANNEX 15&#13;
28.   In summary, the Qujing project selected as the least-cost option for the project is:&#13;
(a)   an interceptor sewer system serving the north and east of the city in this&#13;
phase, but designed for the addition (after 2008) of an interceptor&#13;
specifically designed to serve the anticipated increased development in the&#13;
west;&#13;
(b)   a single STW  serving the city, this initial phase of treatment being an&#13;
intermediate activated sludge process, with disposal of the resulting stable&#13;
sludge to the new landfill site;&#13;
29.   Gejiu Wastewater. Gejiu discharges its domestic sewage to Lake Gejiu, which&#13;
receives wastewater from tin mining and processing and other industrial activities and is&#13;
also used as a balancing reservoir for industrial water supply. As a result, the water&#13;
quality of the Lake has deteriorated to worse than Class V. Excess water from the lake&#13;
(particularly in times of wet weather) is pumped out of the closed valley in which the city&#13;
is located into the Zhadian River to the north. Flooding of Gejiu City occurs when the&#13;
capacity of the existing pumping station is exceeded. To achieve the stated Class IV&#13;
water quality objective, the sewage and industrial wastewater must be prevented from&#13;
entering the lake. The considerable benefits to both lake and downstream river of&#13;
completely separating these from the flood water were identified during project&#13;
development. Principal options considered were based on the location of the STW, since&#13;
there are effectively no significant alternatives to the two interceptor sewers which will&#13;
pick up sewage flows around Lake Gejiu.&#13;
30.   Four possible STW sites were considered, two by the lake and two beside the road&#13;
north out of the city. The lakeside sites were rejected on the grounds that the high value&#13;
of land within the city would not make these the least-cost solutions. (Environmental&#13;
impact on the surrounding urban areas is a further reason for rejecting these, as was the&#13;
higher cost of treatment required to achieve the higher effluent standard for discharge to&#13;
the lake.) Of the two sites north of the city, Site 1 was preferred over Site 2 because of its&#13;
closer proximity to the city, requiring a shorter inlet sewer. The additional cost of the&#13;
inlet sewer to Site 2 would be Y 2 million for the extra 1 km required. The capital cost of&#13;
the sewerage and pumping stations for Gejiu is Y 40 million.&#13;
31.   The arguments on the treatment process to be adopted are the similar to those for&#13;
Qujing, with full treatment options being initially considered. As with Qujing, the&#13;
secondary treatment alternative was deemed unaffordable by the authorities. The desired&#13;
reduction in project cost was achieved by reducing the level of treatment provided in the&#13;
first phase while maintaining the extent of the sewerage system (thus ensuring that all&#13;
wastewater currently reaching Lake Gejiu will be collected and treated). An intermediate&#13;
sludge system with additional sludge stabilization was also chosen for the first phase of&#13;
treatment at Gejiu. Adjacent land has been reserved for the addition of secondary&#13;
biological treatment as soon as that is feasible. Despite the lower treatment level, Lake&#13;
Gejiu water quality will be greatly improved by discharging the treated effluent to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-187-                       ANNEX15&#13;
Zhadian River and replacing the lost water in the dry season (if required) with high-&#13;
quality surface water from controlled discharges from local reservoirs. The risk of&#13;
flooding in the city will be greatly reduced.&#13;
32.   In summary, the Gejiu project selected as the least-cost option for the project is:&#13;
(a)   interceptor sewers around Lake Gejiu, with a sewage pumping station&#13;
lifting the flows to an STW on the north side of the city;&#13;
(b)   a parallel pumping system lifting floodwater from Lake Gejiu to the&#13;
Zhadian River;&#13;
(c)   a single STW  serving the city, the first phase of treatment being an&#13;
intermediate stage activated sludge system.&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
33.   Kunming. The Kunming Water Supply component was evaluated on a least-cost&#13;
basis to supply estimated demand and by the company average incremental cost of the&#13;
new supply with willingness to pay revealed through surveys and the recent price:&#13;
(a)   the extension of two existing Water Treatment Plants (WPT);&#13;
(b)   construction of a new WTP;&#13;
(c)   the extension of existing WTP No. I plus construction of a new WTP.&#13;
34.   Option 3 was both least-cost grounds and most robust to the most likely&#13;
alternative demand scenarios. All long run studies include the eventual importation of&#13;
water, the key being that the combination of effective water demand management and the&#13;
proposed projects, together with other interventions, should defer importation as long as&#13;
possible. Provided all potential water resources within the catchment are developed, the&#13;
indications are that there could be sufficient resources to meet the water demand up to the&#13;
year 2020 at 95 percent reliability. This involves continuing use of Lake Dianchi for&#13;
municipal water supply, albeit using advanced treatment processes, and therefore justifies&#13;
the investment to limit damage to the lake. It also clearly stresses the importance of&#13;
protecting the lake as a local source for future use for drinking water supply and in so&#13;
doing defer more costly interventions as long as possible.&#13;
35.   The raw water source of Songhuaba was selected because it is at present the least-&#13;
cost source and although the primary role of Songhuaba is for irrigation and flood&#13;
control, small increases in municipal supplies can be obtained at the lowest average&#13;
incremental cost. Yield modeling showed that with conjunctive use of Dianchi Lake&#13;
water, Kunming demands could be met from this source without further augmentation.&#13;
36.   Incremental water supplied under the project will be 65 million m3/year at full&#13;
development. It is estimated that some 500,000 new individual connections will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-188 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
provided mainly in the fast growing suburban areas of north, east and west of central&#13;
Kunming. The economic cost of this incremental supply has been estimated to be&#13;
Y 0.60/m3&#13;
37.   Two small willingness-to-pay surveys have been undertaken which indicated that&#13;
a substantial number of people would be prepared to pay that much or more for water.&#13;
The more recent study indicated that 72 percent of the respondents already served by&#13;
piped water would be willing to pay at least Y 0.60/m3. This study confirmed the results&#13;
of a 1993 survey in which 89 percent of the households were willing to pay at least&#13;
Y 0.72/m3 for current supply. The difference between these studies likely reflects their&#13;
methodological differences or small sample error rather than a shift in willingness to pay.&#13;
Kunming increased water tariffs to an average of slightly more than Y 0.60/mi3 in January&#13;
1996. The water company has seen no consumption decline, although this is the winter,&#13;
low demand, season and not until summer will it be possible to fully assess price&#13;
elasticity. Nonetheless, experience at current tariff levels, the willingness to pay surveys&#13;
and the new connection program all strongly support the conclusion that the net present&#13;
value of the investment is positive. Better estimates of the net present value would&#13;
require information about the demand cure when prices are above current levels, but that&#13;
information is lacking.&#13;
38.   Qujing. The Qujing water supply component was evaluated on a least-cost basis&#13;
to supply estimated demand. In Qujing's case, local groundwater and surface water&#13;
supplies have been fully exploited by the existing rural and urban users, so new supply&#13;
must come from either better use of the current system or new sources at a considerable&#13;
distance from the city. In this case, both options would be exploited.&#13;
39.   The current supply relies on three small reservoirs feeding three water treatment&#13;
plants. The treatment plant capacity totals 81,000 m3/d, but the distribution system&#13;
capacity reaches only 55,000 m3/d. Some 26,000 m3/d of potential supply therefore goes&#13;
unexploited in normal-weather years (dry-year supply of the reservoirs does not reach&#13;
treatment plant capacity). Distribution system investments can augment supply by the&#13;
26,000 m 3/d (or 47 percent), at a net present value of Y 0.44/m3 . This contrasts very&#13;
favorably with the Y 0.93/m3 1996 tariff. Using a conservative assumption that new&#13;
supply becomes available over 1999 to 2003; that only 50 percent of newly available&#13;
supply is demanded its first two years, rising to 70 percent over the remaining life of the&#13;
project; and using the 1996 tariff of Y 0.93/m3, rather than the higher real tariffs proposed&#13;
for later years, the distribution system investment realizes a 15 percent rate of return, or a&#13;
Y 4.42 million net present value.&#13;
40.   The distribution system expansion would primarily serve areas designed for new&#13;
industry and residences, areas now provided with all other infrastructure but the water.&#13;
Although Qujing's industrial and population growth has been rapid and is now&#13;
constrained primarily by water supply, the investment clearly will be most sensitive to the&#13;
offtake of treated water and to the availability of raw water (given drought year supply&#13;
problems). Sensitivity tests therefore concentrated on this issue, and the investment was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-189 -                       ANNEX 15&#13;
found to be quite robust. For example, even with only 35 percent capacity use in the first&#13;
five years of operation, rising to only 50 percent thereafter, the rate of return remains at 7&#13;
percent. Use would have to fall to only 30 percent of the new capacity over the life of the&#13;
project to drive the rate of return down to zero.&#13;
Solid Waste-Kunming and Qujing&#13;
41.   Initial choices for the solid waste management projects in both Kunming and&#13;
Qujing were based on an evaluation aimed at defining the most appropriate technologies.&#13;
A least-cost analysis of options was developed for the optimization of the key&#13;
components. The initial evaluation considered potential solid waste treatment and&#13;
disposal strategies including recycling, composting, incineration and gasification, and&#13;
landfilling. Recycling already plays an active role in each of the cities, capturing most of&#13;
the 5 percent of the municipal waste stream that can be profitably recycled, mainly glass,&#13;
plastics and metals. The industry is highly competitive, with a combination of state-&#13;
owned and private firms providing services and little scope for additional municipal&#13;
intervention.&#13;
42.   Composting, to recycle organic materials, has been tested in both Kunming and&#13;
Qujing, but there have been serious operational and environmental problems, costs have&#13;
been high and markets have not supported adequate sales.  Both incineration and&#13;
gasification have been shown in other cities with similar waste streams to be substantially&#13;
more costly than landfill. The current continuing significant use of coal in Kunming&#13;
gives the waste a low combustion value, over half the waste stream being inorganic. This&#13;
represents a major problem for both composting and incineration/gasification from which&#13;
the residues still require landfilling. Landfill was therefore chosen in both cities for the&#13;
disposal of municipal solid wastes.&#13;
43.   An evaluation of the collection system in Kunming showed the advantage of&#13;
developing two landfill sites to serve opposite sides of the city and significantly reduce&#13;
the haul distances and environmental impact. The identification and assessment of&#13;
sanitary landfill sites took into account factors including haul distance, life expectancy,&#13;
cost, access, land use, land acquisition and resettlement, cover material, ecology,&#13;
hydrogeology and potential reuse. Five potential sites were identified for Kunming.&#13;
44.   Acknowledging the difficulty in a area like Yunnan of finding a landfill site which&#13;
can meet all the impermeability requirements naturally, it was accepted that artificial&#13;
linings would have to be provided for at least some part of any landfill site chosen for the&#13;
two cities. However, the risk of earthquake damage to the liner and the potential for&#13;
groundwater contamination is small, there having been only 14 earthquakes in the region&#13;
of not more than 7 (on the Richter scale) over the last 500 years. The preferred sanitary&#13;
landfill sites for Kunming were identified as Hongshuitang and Baishuitang with a total&#13;
cost of Y 45.8 million and a life expectancy of 21 years. In a similar exercise for Qujing,&#13;
in which four sites were subject to a similar assessment, a single site, with a total cost of&#13;
Y 11.8 million in the first phase and a life expectancy of 19 years and located between the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-190 -                       ANNEX 15&#13;
city's two main urban centers (Qujing and Zhanyi), was chosen at Back Valley of Taihe&#13;
Mountain.&#13;
45.   In both cases, the least-cost site had, as one of the main decision criteria,&#13;
minimization of the joint cost of transport and land acquisition. Since land acquisition&#13;
cost correlates very strongly with resettlement impact, this criterion also tends to&#13;
minimize resettlement. Sanitary landfills must also comply with national standards,&#13;
which require leachate and gas collection. No attempt was made, therefore, to compare&#13;
the cost of including these with the damage which would ensue from their absence.&#13;
Given the long-run risks inherent in unprotected landfills, the need to provide leachate&#13;
and gas collection was accepted and additional impact evaluation was not carried out.&#13;
46.   Although solid waste collection and transfer vehicles and equipment have a&#13;
relatively short life, the transfer stations which form an integral part of the system have&#13;
much longer lives, and therefore need to be designed for flexibility to adjust to changing&#13;
situations. The analysis of the waste collection system therefore addressed both the cost&#13;
of collection and transfer equipment and the optimization of size, location and design of&#13;
small, medium and large transfer stations (STSs, MTSs and LTSs) within the city. Costs&#13;
of collection and transfer were analyzed and optimized using the UNCHS WAGS&#13;
Compactor Program for equipment ranging from tricycles to container trucks.&#13;
47.   Optimization of the numbers of collection vehicles showed that for Kunming the&#13;
ideal system should be one with a large number of STSs. Waste is carried direct from&#13;
them to the landfill sites in 8-ton containers. However, an evaluation of the land&#13;
acquisition and environmental impact aspects of the 35 STSs originally proposed&#13;
demonstrated the considerable problems of trying to locate a large number of transfer&#13;
stations of any size within the city. Particular environmental problems related to noise in&#13;
residential areas and to increased traffic movements during the night. On these grounds,&#13;
the decision was taken to limit the number of transfer stations in Kunming and thus build&#13;
only 15 STSs and to locate four MTSs in the areas of greatest environmental impact.&#13;
Sites for a further two MTSs were identified for future expansion. The evaluation&#13;
showed that there was no need at all for LTSs, because the time saving achieved would&#13;
not justify the additional capital and operating costs of the LTS and related vehicles.&#13;
48.   A similar exercise in Qujing showed that the least-cost system would be one with&#13;
five STSs in Qujing City and one in Zhanyi. No MTSs are required because of the short&#13;
haul distance to the landfill site.&#13;
49.   The key area for sensitivity analysis is in the anticipated changes to the nature of&#13;
the waste over the lifetime of the two schemes. The feasibility study for solid waste&#13;
demonstrated that the density of the waste is expected to fall by 15 to 20 percent over the&#13;
next 10 to 15 years as conversion from coal to gas proceeds in the two cities. In&#13;
Kunming, the existing STSs already serve residential and commercial areas where gas&#13;
conversion has taken place and so little change is expected for them. New STSs and&#13;
MTSs should be designed to allow the use of deeper containers in the future to maintain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-191-                        ANNEX 15&#13;
an optimum load capacity for the lower density wastes. The density of the waste will&#13;
remain quite high for the foreseeable future, so there is no advantage in the use of&#13;
compactor trucks for waste collection during the next 10 to 15 years. These are not&#13;
therefore being provided. In the MTSs, the waste loaders can be used to achieve a small&#13;
increase in compaction (by applying pressure during loading). The slightly increased&#13;
need for additional capacity can be met by adjusting shift hours for the vehicles.&#13;
50.   Operational flexibility will be built into waste collection management to allow in-&#13;
situ decisions on the need to take waste either to local STSs or to go direct to MTSs&#13;
depending on traffic levels and thus save on waste handling and costs. The increasing&#13;
need to formalize waste recycling processes as the standard of living in the city rises can&#13;
be accommodated by the short-run modification of the collection system and vehicles, but&#13;
if any changes in waste quantities reaching the landfills are likely, they can be expected to&#13;
decrease, simply extending the landfill life.&#13;
Industrial Pollution Control&#13;
51.   The industrial pollution control component has three subcomponents, two&#13;
involving funding for the two fertilizer factories on Lake Dianchi (ranked as the most&#13;
environmentally damaging enterprises on the lake) and the third a pollution control fund&#13;
targeting small investments and small-scale enterprises. The first two components were&#13;
appraised by the Bank/IDA.&#13;
52.   The environmental pollution control subloans facility remains to be established.&#13;
The goal of the fund is to serve as a model for the operation of the municipal and county-&#13;
run pollution control funds capitalized though pollution levy fees. These are revolving&#13;
finds, but to date have lacked effective management, targeting and credit policies. The&#13;
fund will seek to minimize management costs, while effectively recycling loans. The&#13;
fund will bear credit risk because the bank managing it will play a solely agent role.&#13;
Loans will be made at a rate of no less than 150 basis points above the standard interest&#13;
rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans, the margin to be determined by&#13;
operating costs and credit risk assessment. The Fund will also face a history of pollution&#13;
levy fees as grants increasing the credit risk. The fund will respond to these risks in two&#13;
ways, first by careful financial analysis and conservative lending, and second by&#13;
concentrating on smaller loans with relatively short repayment periods.&#13;
53.   The second part of the Industrial Pollution Control strategy involves direct&#13;
investment in two chemical fertilizer plants producing a high proportion of phosphorus&#13;
load in Lake Dianchi. The fertilizer factories contribute 16 percent of total phosphorus&#13;
(TP) discharge to the Lake and 73 percent of industrial phosphorus loads. The two&#13;
factories are Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Factory and Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer&#13;
Factory.&#13;
54.   Existing wastewater treatment facilities at the factories are inadequate for present&#13;
loads and frequent breakdowns further reduce treatment. In a attempt by the Central&#13;
Government to hold down agricultural input prices, the fertilizer industry is subject to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-192 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
strict price control which forces many of them to operate at a loss, made up through&#13;
government subsidies.  However, subsidies do not cover adequate operation and&#13;
maintenance funds which exacerbates operating pressures on the waste treatment systems.&#13;
Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Factory&#13;
55.   Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Factory is owned by the Heavy Industry and&#13;
Chemical Industry Bureau of Kunming Municipality and is located close to the&#13;
southeastern shore of Dianchi Lake. Its products are nitrogen and phosphorus based with&#13;
potential capacity of 185,000 tons per year which includes ammonia, phosphoric acid,&#13;
nitrogen phosphorus potassium (NPK) and ammonium carbonate (NH4HCO3). The&#13;
Factory sustains losses of approximately Y 10 million per year on capital of Y 90 million.&#13;
Overall, it discharges 4.83 million m3/year containing 35 tons/year of total phosphorus&#13;
(TP) and 555 tons/ year of ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) to the Waihai of Lake Dianchi.&#13;
56.   The Yunnan Chemical Industry Design Institute feasibility study proposed&#13;
production changes including a major investment in a new 80,000 tons/year H2SO4 plant,&#13;
which will allow continuous operation and reduce pollution problems arising from&#13;
current stop-start operations.  Recovery of raw materials from wastewater will be&#13;
increased and recycling of water will improve. The majority of the Y 54 million&#13;
investment will help fund the new sulfuric acid (H2SO4) Plant. The remaining sum will&#13;
be used in the following way:&#13;
(a)   modification to NH3-N production processes;&#13;
(b)   modification to monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and phosphoric acid&#13;
(H3PO4) production processes;&#13;
(c)   modification to water recycling system,&#13;
(d)   treatment for MAP and H3PO4 wastewaters,&#13;
(e)   modification to water supply system, to drainage,&#13;
(f)   general drawing and transport,&#13;
(g)   treatment of ammonia wastewater,&#13;
(h)   further modification to NH3-N production processes, and&#13;
(i)   other capital construction.&#13;
The proposed improvements will reduce wastewater discharge to Lake Dianchi of TP&#13;
to nearly zero and ammonia to 10 tons/year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-193 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
57.   Currently the output of the plant is sold at an average of over 50 percent less&#13;
than the border price of these products. This adversely affects the financial viability of&#13;
the firm and the financial viability of the incremental project because without price&#13;
control the firm could put up its prices to about this extent (plus or minus any&#13;
differential transport costs between the firm, customer and port) and still remain&#13;
competitive. However the firm also receives competitive advantage from subsidized&#13;
and controlled prices of its inputs. An initial attempt to adjust the rates of return for&#13;
both these effects suggests that the rates of return to the project would not be&#13;
significantly higher that those above if the company was operating in a regime of&#13;
uncontrolled prices. In fact, the project itself will move the company into a less&#13;
controlled environment as the new processes and products are less subject to price&#13;
control.&#13;
58.   The economic rates of return for the proposed investment were calculated on a&#13;
base core of 83 percent capacity utilization. To date, plant sales have been construed&#13;
by input shortage, rather than lack of output demands. Relief of the input constraint&#13;
should allow full production (which, by industry standards in China is 300 days per&#13;
year). The sensitivity analysis focused on the capacity utilization issue, on a proxy for&#13;
both operational problems, and lack of member demand. It also looked at input price&#13;
shifts in sulfur, one of the key inputs The results of the analysis are given below.&#13;

Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Factory&#13;
59.   Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Factory is owned by the Provincial Chemical&#13;
Industry Department and is located approximately 69 km from Kunming and southwest&#13;
of Dianchi Lake. Its major outputs are more than 24 phosphate ore-based products&#13;
weighting more than 300,000 tons per year including phosphate and superphosphate&#13;
fertilizer, phosphate chemical products and other products. At present, the Factory owns&#13;
fixed assets of Y 150 million and employs 2,900 people. It maintains a modest profit of&#13;
Y 3 million per year or a return of 2 percent on capital. It currently discharges 4.1 million&#13;
m3/year containing 504 tons/year of suspended solids, 56.5 tons/year of total phosphorus&#13;
and 22.9 tons/year of fluoride to the Waihai of Lake Dianchi.&#13;

60.   The Yunnan Chemical Industry Design Institute feasibility study assessed three&#13;
engineering options on the basis that they minimized the quantity of effluent discharged.&#13;
The options all involved process and product changes. No options were considered for&#13;
the water treatment plants. The proposed production changes will shift the composition&#13;
of final products away from certain phosphate products (calcium magnesium phosphate)&#13;
to high-value food-grade phosphates. Two new water treatment plants are proposed to&#13;
increase recycling of water. The major portion of the Y 75 million investment will be&#13;
placed in:&#13;
(a)   modification of the 40,000 tons/year H2SO4 Plant,&#13;
(b)   two-stage precipitation wastewater treatment facility and&#13;
(c)   production facilities for food-grade compounds.&#13;
61.   Other improvements are:&#13;
(a)   modification to the existing production processes,&#13;
(b)   expansion/modification to existing treatment facility,&#13;
(c)   modification to water recycling system,&#13;
(d)   segregation of drainage,&#13;
(e)   discharge pipeline,&#13;
(f)    water supply station and&#13;
(g)   importation of technical know-how.&#13;
62.   After the investment in production processes, overall TP discharge will decrease&#13;
from 56.5 tons/year to 0.84 tons/year.&#13;
63.   Similar to the Kunming Chemical Fertilizer Factory, economic analysis was&#13;
performed on Kunyang with and without the proposed investment. Sensitivity analysis&#13;
was performed by varying output and observing its effects on the economic internal rates&#13;
of return (ERR). The results of the analysis are shown in Table 4.&#13;

64.   Currently the output of the plant is sold at an average of between 30 and 40&#13;
percent less than the border price of these products.  This adversely affects the&#13;
financial viability of the firm and the financial viability of the incremental project&#13;
because without price control the firm could put up its prices to about this extent (plus&#13;
or minus any differential transport costs between the firm, customer and port) and still&#13;
remain competitive. However the firm also receives competitive advantage from&#13;
subsidized and controlled prices of its inputs. An initial attempt to adjust the rates of&#13;
return for both these effects suggests that the rates of return to the project would not be&#13;
significantly higher that those above if the company was operating in a regime of&#13;
uncontrolled prices. In fact, the project itself will move the company into a less&#13;
controlled environment as the new processes and products are less subject to price&#13;
control.&#13;
65.   Overall, the proposed investment in the two plants would upgrade their&#13;
production processes, change some of the final outputs and allow profitable and&#13;
cleaner operations. Phosphorus discharge will drop from 93 tons per year to below 2&#13;
tons. The amount of other pollutants will also drop. As the preferred options undergo&#13;
further review, the economic and financial analysis will be amended appropriately.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis on the two investment indicated that Kunming Chemical is more&#13;
robust than Kunyang Phosphate.&#13;
C. AFFORDABILITY&#13;
66.   The affordability issue arises only with the water and wastewater components of&#13;
the proposed project. The industrial pollution interventions will proceed only if the&#13;
enterprises can demonstrate that they will remain financially sound after the investment.&#13;
Solid waste charges will rise only for industrial and commercial users of the new&#13;
landfills. Affordability of the new water and wastewater systems was tested against&#13;
current consumption patterns and average income of the poorest 10 percent of the urban&#13;
population in the three cities. The proposed first-year tariff would consume an average of&#13;
less than 2 percent of the income of the poorest 10 percent of the population, with&#13;
wastewater fees based on 80 percent of water used. Indeed, because the poor are less&#13;
likely than other households to have water piped to the, even the 2 percent figure&#13;
represents an upper bound.&#13;

Long-Term Strategic Risks&#13;
71.   Increase Environmental Pressures. Rapid economic and population growth in&#13;
the Dianchi Catchment may simply exert too much pressure on available water and land&#13;
resources, and the emergent planning and environmental controls may not be able to cope&#13;
with this. Furthermore, the degree of ecological integrity and carrying capacity of the&#13;
environment are key parameters which will determine the level and intensity of urban and&#13;
rural development in the catchment but many of these are unknown at present. Increased&#13;
environmental pressures are from the following:&#13;
(a)    Policy Conflicts I-Inappropriate Resource Pricing. The underlying&#13;
causes of a number of environmental problems in the Dianchi Catchment&#13;
are in part a product of policies operating at the national level, especially&#13;
as they relate to resource pricing and agricultural support policies, such as&#13;
price   controls  on   fertilizer  supply.              The   longer-term    transition   to&#13;
sustainable development will require changes at the national level to&#13;
resource pricing and agricultural development objectives and plans.&#13;
(b)    Policy Conflicts II-Going for Growth. Other areas of potential conflict&#13;
include the push for economic growth and need to protect the&#13;
environment. In the short run it is tempting to "go for growth" and then&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-199 -                     ANNEX 15&#13;
return to the task of cleaning up, rehabilitating and protecting the&#13;
environment. This strategy is very risky and is unlikely to be successful&#13;
given the existing precarious position of water resource shortages and&#13;
degradation.  The latter will almost certainly put a brake on future&#13;
development, and thus undermine future income and employment growth,&#13;
if no pollution control and water conservation measures are implemented&#13;
immediately.&#13;
(c)   Rapid Growth in Rural Areas. Increases in TVE and other rural-based&#13;
activities in the catchment area will increase the demand for scarce water&#13;
resources and increase pollution loads. Rural-based activities are the most&#13;
difficult to control as they are currently outside the urban master plan&#13;
areas. This threat principally relates to Dianchi Lake (control apply in the&#13;
Songhuaba Reservoir area).&#13;
(d)   Rapid growth of Kunming. Population growth (including the floating&#13;
population in the urban and peri-urban areas) will lead to intensified&#13;
competition for land and water while at the same time increase pollution&#13;
loads. A key risk here is that the pace of urban development exceeds the&#13;
financial and institutional capacity of Kunming Municipal Government&#13;
(KMG) to implement urban environmental service improvements and&#13;
pollution control measures.&#13;
72.   Mitigation measures designed to mediate or avoid these risks include&#13;
strengthening the development planning system, improving resources pricing, and&#13;
improving the provision of environmental services provision. A key focal point of the&#13;
YEP is to strengthen the planning and provision of environmental services.&#13;
Complementing these initiatives are broader planning proposals in DEAP, which are&#13;
aimed at providing effective tools for regulating development in the Lake Dianchi and&#13;
Songhuaba Basins. The IPC Components of the YEP and DEAP, coupled with improved&#13;
resource pricing and pollution charges, are also designed to support industry and&#13;
introduce pollution prevention/pollution control measures. The objectives for managing&#13;
development include limiting the scale of growth to the resources available to support it.&#13;
Institutional Risks: Failure to Manage Environmental Pressures&#13;
73.   Increasing environmental pressures necessitate that institutions must have the&#13;
capacity to manage these pressures. Environmental management in the catchment is&#13;
marked by weak and fragmented institutions, lack of clear lines of authority and conflict&#13;
and lack of cooperation among institutions at all levels. To date there has been a&#13;
reluctance to enforce regulations and make polluters pay. There will be an overriding&#13;
need for cooperation and coordination among institutions specifically responsible for&#13;
environmental protection and development control around Lake Dianchi and the&#13;
Songhuaba Reservoir. A critical component of the success of the YEP and DEAP is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

enforcement by Yunnan Provincial Government (YPG), KMG and the KEPB of the&#13;
existing and enhanced environmental protection measures and regulations.&#13;
Financial Risks&#13;
74.       There  are  a  number  of longer-term   financial risks  to  the  project.   There  is&#13;
uncertainty regarding the state of municipal finances. The major concern here is the&#13;
extent of off-budget and contingent liabilities incurred by KMG and other municipal&#13;
governments and their impact on the affordability of the YEP at the municipal level. It is&#13;
important that there is no delay in accessing funds in support of the project and&#13;
complementary investments required to support overall environmental improvement in&#13;
the Dianchi Lake Basin.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Yunnan Environment Project is part
            of a phased development program of Yunnan Province to
            improve environmental conditions and sustain urban services
            management. The principal objective of the project is to
            provide a sustainable environmental framework for the long
            term economic and social development of the province, while
            providing a conducive foundation for industrial growth.
            Specific objectives of the project are to: 1) strengthen
            policies, regulations and institutional arrangements for
            pollution control, and municipal water, wastewater, solid
            waste and nightsoil management; 2) support the improvement
            of the lakes environment in Gejiu and Kunming in order to
            allow the waters to be used for potable supply, industry or
            agriculture, as appropriate; 3) facilitate complementary
            sustainable investments in pollution control and
            municipally-provided urban environmental services; and 4)
            introduce a comprehensive approach to planning,
            prioritization, management, and financing of urban
            environmental infrastructure investments. The components of
            the project are as follows: 1) lake Dianchi basin water
            quality recovery; 2) industrial pollution control; 3)
            provincial urban environmental services; 4) environmental
            and water quality monitoring; and 5) institutional
            development, training and construction supervision.
