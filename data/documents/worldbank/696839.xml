CHILE&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND AND SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. Macroeconomic Background&#13;
1.1         Over the last decade, Chile has experienced one of the most sustained&#13;
macroeconomic performances in Latin America. Since 1982, exports tripled and the&#13;
economy grew for 11 consecutive years. From 1984 to 1994, driven by the remarkable&#13;
annual growth rates in investments and exports, averaging 14.3 percent and 9.9 percent,&#13;
respectively, GDP increased by an average annual rate of 6.8 percent. During the same&#13;
period, inflation declined from 23 percent to 8.9 percent. At end-1994, Chile had a&#13;
relatively small public sector (general government expenditures totalled 23.3 percent of&#13;
GDP), high investment rates (25.6 percent of GDP), a strong reserve position, a relatively&#13;
flexible labor code, and an open trade regime.&#13;
1.2         The steady resolve of successive Administrations to carry out a comprehensive&#13;
reform program aimed at redefining the role of the state brought about the sound economic&#13;
performance. Starting in the mid 1970s, Chile began reducing trade protection sharply,&#13;
privatizing firms and restructuring public enterprises along commercial lines, decreasing&#13;
Government subsidies, and decentralizing responsibilities to the municipal level. An&#13;
innovative pension reform program, designed to increase domestic savings, offered social&#13;
security payers access to newly established pension funds.&#13;
1.3         In 1992, the economy reached its highest growth rate (10.4 percent) in 27&#13;
years. Real 1993 GDP growth declined to 6.3 percent due to a deterioration in Chile's terms&#13;
of trade, reflecting a 15 percent decline in international prices of its major exports (copper,&#13;
paper products, fishmeal and fruit) and a restrictive monetary policy that had been adopted to&#13;
cool the economy. A substantial rebound in copper prices, along with strong demand from&#13;
Chile's markets turned the economy around in the second quarter of 1994. As a result, the&#13;
trade balance improved and the current account deficit dropped to 0.9 percent of GDP in&#13;
1994. Chile's balance of payments continued to benefit from strong increases in capital&#13;
inflows induced by prudent macroeconomic management, deep capital markets, and well-&#13;
defined legal and regulatory frameworks. As a consequence, the Central Bank accumulated&#13;
ample reserves, up to US$13 billion (equivalent to 9.8 months' imports) by end-1994, and&#13;
the peso appreciated by 7.1 percent in nominal terms in 1994. While a restrictive monetary&#13;
policy succeeded in reducing annual inflation to 8.9 percent in 1994, GDP growth slowed to&#13;
4.5 percent. As a result, unemployment increased to 6.5 percent, up from a record low 4.5&#13;
percent in 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
B. Agriculture in the Economy&#13;
Policy Framework&#13;
1.4          The macroeconomic policy reforms of the mid-1980s, complemented by&#13;
sectoral policy adjustments, liberalized domestic and foreign trade agricultural markets and&#13;
eliminated distortions in the credit system. Most agricultural products have a uniform 11&#13;
percent tariff and are free of non-quantitative trade restrictions. Price bands for a few basic&#13;
staples, i.e. wheat and sugar, minimize the destabilizing impact sharp changes in import&#13;
prices could have on domestic production. Private banks provide credit to commercial&#13;
farmers at real interest rates between 6.5 percent and 9 percent. Small farmers have access&#13;
to a special credit line, whose funds are available at interest rates linked to the cost of money&#13;
as determined by Central Bank operations. The current interest rate for small farmers is 7.5&#13;
percent in real terms.&#13;
Performance&#13;
1.5          The agricultural sector contributes approximately 8 percent of GDP, employs&#13;
18 percent of the country's economically active population and generates 35 percent of its&#13;
merchandise exports. Chile is a highly urbanized country, with under 15 percent of its 13.6&#13;
million inhabitants living in rural areas. Between 1983 and 1989, agricultural GDP&#13;
(including forestry and fisheries) grew at an average annual rate of 5.8 percent, with export&#13;
crops playing a leading role. Between 1989 and 1992, declining world prices for fruit and&#13;
horticultural exports and decreased wheat production caused the annual agricultural growth&#13;
rate to drop to 3.0 percent. During the past two years, the gradual appreciation of the peso&#13;
has affected exports. Although agricultural export growth will continue, sector growth will&#13;
be determined by the capacity of producers to improve productivity and orient their&#13;
production towards highly profitable crops.&#13;
1.6          Within the sector, there are marked differences in performance and natural&#13;
resource management among regions, crops and producers. Regional differences reflect&#13;
agro-ecological variations. Among crops, contrasts are explained by diverse and dynamic&#13;
market opportunities. The most pronounced differences in productivity and profitability are&#13;
found between commercial and small farmers. Reconciliation of this duality, compounded by&#13;
the diversity within the small farmer sector, ranging from those with agricultural potential to&#13;
those with limited or no agricultural potential, will be this Government's most serious&#13;
sectoral challenge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
C. Rural Poverty&#13;
1.7             In the 1980s, over 40 percent of the population lived in poverty - with&#13;
insufficient income to cover their basic needs.' Half of these were extremely poor - unable&#13;
to satisfy their minimum food requirements. In 1992, while 80 percent of the poor were&#13;
urban dwellers, the incidence of poverty in the rural areas (34 percent) was greater than in&#13;
urban areas (30 percent). In the project area, covering Regions VI through VIII, the&#13;
incidence of rural poverty was greater than 40 percent. In 1991, 84 percent of the country's&#13;
poorest municipalities (comunas)2 were rural.3 The rural poor tend to be small farmers,&#13;
older and having a lower education than the rest of the population. They are confronted by&#13;
deteriorating soils and limited access to credit and critical social services.&#13;
1.8           Between 1990 and 1993, the Solidarity and Social Investment Fund (FOSIS)&#13;
financed more than 2.100 projects, valued at US$34 million, to improve the welfare of the&#13;
poorest sectors.4 Between 1990 and 1993, the national poverty level fell from 40 percent to&#13;
33 percent due to sustained economic growth, increased social expenditure and greater&#13;
poverty alleviation investments. During that period, the incidence of urban poverty declined&#13;
by 23.8 percent and rural incidence fell by 20 percent. However, poverty incidence in the&#13;
project area decreased by less than 12 percent.&#13;

credit to small farmers6 and their families. The Bank-financed Small Farmer Project (Ln&#13;
3473-CH), along with IDB-supported programs, have improved INDAP's ability to&#13;
effectively transfer to small farmers agricultural assistance suited to the small farners'&#13;
economic and environmental conditions. INDAP programs serve two sub-sectors of small&#13;
farmers: those with sufficient resources to increase their productivity in the short-term; and&#13;
those with potential to increase family well-being but with more limited land resources.&#13;
Recent budget restrictions and a heightened poverty reduction focus has reduced the INDAP&#13;
participation of better-off farmers through a graduation program. As a result, between 1990&#13;
and 1994, the share of the most disadvantaged farmers among INDAP's clientele has&#13;
increased from 53 percent to 75 percent.&#13;
Agricultural and Forestry Research7&#13;
1 . 10        The Institute for Agricultural Research (Instituto de Investigaciones&#13;
Agropecuarias - INIA) is a non-profit foundation (corporaci6n de derecho privado), under&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture which supports the development of technologies designed to&#13;
increase agricultural production and productivity. Field workers and NGOs experienced in&#13;
the region indicate that small farmers often could not afford INIA-promoted production&#13;
technologies. To address this shortcoming, INIA, with an IDB-funded project, Technology&#13;
Adjustment and Transfer Centers (Centros de Ajuste y Transferencia de Tecnologia -&#13;
CATT),8 is reorienting its research in production systems towards the needs of INDAP's&#13;
main beneficiary group, small farmers, including those participating in the Irrigation&#13;
Development Project (Loan 3828-CH) financed PROMM program. INIA Secano research&#13;
programs are located in its Los Vilos, Hidango and Cauquenes sub-stations (See also para.&#13;
3.5).&#13;
1.11          The Forestry Institute (Instituto Forestal - INFOR), under the Production&#13;
Development Corporation (Corporaci6n de Fomento de la Producci6n - CORFO), is a&#13;
research and development institution which: (i) develops and adapts forestry technology; (ii)&#13;
disseminates economic and market information related to forest exploitation; and (iii)&#13;
provides services supporting forest activities. Central headquarters are in Santiago, with a&#13;
Regional Division in Concepci6n.&#13;
1.12          Increasingly, the research programs in many universities and private institutes&#13;
are becoming interested in the social and economic conditions of small farmers, especially&#13;
those living in the country's more remote regions, such as the Secano.&#13;
6.     Under INDAP criteria, small farmers have: (i) a farm of under 12 HRB equivalent; (ii) assets less&#13;
than 3,500 UF (US$104,000); and (iii) agriculture as their main income source, regardless of land&#13;
tenure arrangements. A basic irrigated hectare, or hectirea de riego basico (HRB), is equivalent to one&#13;
hectare of Class I irrigated land in the fertile Maipo River Valley near Santiago.&#13;

Forestry Development&#13;
1.13         The National Forestry Corporation (Corporaci6n Nacional Forestal - CONAF)&#13;
is a forestry development para-statal within the Ministry of Agriculture. CONAF administers&#13;
a forest plantation subsidy program, coordinates forest fire protection systems, controls&#13;
commercial forestry operations and develops sectoral strategies. CONAF has a staff of&#13;
1,200 persons, distributed in 42 regional offices, throughout 112 geographic areas with&#13;
significant forest resources.&#13;
Natural Resource Conservation&#13;
1.14         The Agricultural and Livestock Service (Servicio Agricola y Ganadero - SAG),&#13;
a Santiago-based decentralized entity under the Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for&#13;
agricultural crop and animal health and sanitary control and renewable natural resource&#13;
protection. Because of budget constraints, natural resource conservation programs only issue&#13;
environmental regulations and do not actively promote rational resource use. It supervises&#13;
compliance of rules governing seed and ethyl alcohol production and foreign trade of&#13;
agricultural products. SAG has 12 regional offices and 2,000 employees.&#13;
E. Bank Experience in the Agricultural Sector&#13;
Rural Poverty Alleviation and Agricultural Development&#13;
1.15         Rural projects are at the crux of Bank operational objectives, addressing, at the&#13;
same time, poverty alleviation, natural resource conservation, macroeconomic and sectoral&#13;
policy rationalization, beneficiary participation, private sector development and gender&#13;
issues. As a result, rural sector lending is complex - demanding sound, innovative&#13;
approaches .9&#13;
1.16          Successful rural development projects require six elements.'° First, sound&#13;
macroeconomic and sector policies, as reflected in a country's public expenditure program,&#13;
are critical to create an enabling environment which reduces tendencies to overburden&#13;
projects with multiple objectives and strengthens project implementing agencies. Second,&#13;
intensive consultation with beneficiaries is needed to build consensus and support for project&#13;
objectives. Third, a phased approach, focusing only on sub-sectors vital for small farmer&#13;
development and poverty alleviation, is most likely to succeed. Fourth, project scale needs&#13;
to conform to demonstrated institutional and funding capacity. Fifth, while design should be&#13;

sufficiently flexible to permit modifications, objectives and indicators need be clearly&#13;
defined." Finally, effective rural projects need to be technically sound.'2&#13;
1.17          The Colombia Rural Development Investment Project (Ln.3250-CO) is an&#13;
example of a decentralized, demand-driven program of diverse rural investments, having&#13;
well-defined objectives, intense community participation and minimum Government&#13;
involvement. Communities, with Bank support, directly contract firms to provide small&#13;
farmer agricultural extension services. Special extension sub-projects develop the technology&#13;
small farmers need to diversify production and intensify land use. An incentive system&#13;
ensures the participation of poorer communities.&#13;
1.18         Socio-economic development funds, such as the Bolivia Emergency Social&#13;
Fund, are increasingly used to finance micro-enterprise development and social infrastructure&#13;
to alleviate poverty and/or tide the poor through periods of adjustment. Experience&#13;
demonstrates the value of flexibility, precisely defined objectives and investment criteria,&#13;
sound management, rapid procurement procedures and high calibre staff.'3 Poorer&#13;
communities have often required assistance to prepare sub-projects proposals. In the&#13;
Honduran fund, credit was successfully supplied to rural micro-entrepreneurs by using NGOs&#13;
as financial intermediaries. Market interest rates were charged to final beneficiaries, and&#13;
NGOs assumed full credit risk. Recovery was ensured by group solidarity, rather than&#13;
physical or financial guarantees.&#13;
Natural Resource Management&#13;
1.19         The Bank should help countries to incorporate natural resource management as&#13;
a central element in national development and poverty alleviation strategies."4 Project&#13;
conditionality cannot substitute for economic and social policies which specifically benefit the&#13;
poor in ecologically-sensitive areas. Incentive structures need to reinforce project natural&#13;
resource goals. Resource users should be actively involved in project design and&#13;
execution. '" Finally, projects must be technically solid. For example, agro-ecological&#13;
zoning has become the sine qua non for successful public investment in environmentally&#13;
fragile areas; and, the failure to understand key agro-ecological issues can undermine a&#13;
project's expectation of agricultural and livestock improvements.&#13;

Lessons Learned from Involvement in Chile&#13;
1.20         The current lending portfolio in Chile, comprising 16 projects with an&#13;
undisbursed balance of US$529.2 million as of September 30, 1995, has performed well.&#13;
The Chilean experience highlights the importance of sound macroeconomic and sectoral&#13;
policies, complemented by a strong institutional framework with a skilled civil service.&#13;
1.21         The Bank has extended nine agricultural loans to Chile in the past four&#13;
decades, totalling US$260.0 million. Early projects provided credit for modernization and&#13;
expansion of agricultural infrastructure. Small-farmer development and poverty alleviation,&#13;
typified by the Small Farmer Services Project (Ln. 3473-CH) and the Irrigation Development&#13;
Project (PROMM, Ln.3528-CH), were approved in 1992. Lessons from these are the value&#13;
of (i) flexibility in project design; and (ii) beneficiary involvement. The project's flexible&#13;
design allowed beneficiaries to specify project activities.&#13;
-I. PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Characteristics of the Secano 16&#13;
Natural Resource Base and Land Use&#13;
2.1          The area of influence of the proposed project is within the dryland areas of the&#13;
slopes of the Cordillera de la Costa [Coastal Mountain Range], known as respectively, the&#13;
"Coastal" and "Inland" Secano. The entire Secano stretches from Region V to Region X&#13;
(between parallels 320 20' and 420 30', S. Lat.), covering 5.7 million hectares. The project&#13;
area of influence would incorporate Region VI to VIII, covering 3.5 million ha. This area&#13;
covers four agro-ecological zones, with a climate that varies from mediterranean in the north&#13;
to marine in the south and annual rainfall ranging from 350 mm, in the north, to 1,200 mm,&#13;
towards the south.&#13;
2.2          Irrational use is degrading regional natural resources. Pasture area greatly&#13;
exceeds the area suitable for such purpose, less than 5 percent of which is improved pasture.&#13;
To avoid soil erosion, nearly 60 percent of the region should be under forest, yet only 10&#13;
percent is. In many areas, basic grains, fruit trees and table grapes, vegetables and flowers,&#13;
are cultivated on soils ill-suited for these crops.&#13;
16.    Background information refers to the Secano from Regions VI to VIII, the proposed project's area of&#13;
influence. The numbers correspond to the administrative regions into which the country was divided in&#13;
1980, beginning with Region I in the north, and extending to Region XII in the south. See Annex A&#13;
for details and map at end of report.&#13;

2.3          Secano production systems include: (i) agricultural; (ii) agricultural-livestock;&#13;
and (iii) agricultural-livestock-forestry systems. The production systems (i) and (ii) prevail&#13;
in the North; forestry acquires greater importance as one moves southward. Grapes are&#13;
cultivated in southern areas, and potatoes, beans and similar crops are produced in the&#13;
marine terraces near the coast.&#13;
Population. Farm Size and Land Tenure&#13;
2.4          The Secano population, in Regions VI through VIII, is an estimated 2 million&#13;
inhabitants, distributed among 68 municipalities. About 440,000 people or a fifth of this&#13;
population is rural, more than half of whom are poor."7 Between 1982 and 1992, the&#13;
Secano population grew by 13.2 percent, while its rural population, because of the harsh&#13;
economic conditions, declined by more than 8 percent.&#13;

2.5          More than 80 percent of the farms, representing more than a fifth of the&#13;
Secano area, are under 50 hectares, with an average size of 23 hectares. However, because&#13;
of the area's poor soils, average farm size, expressed in basic irrigated hectares (HRB),'8 is&#13;
equivalent only to 4 HRB. Secano farms ranging between 50 and 200 ha are, on average,&#13;
equivalent to only 12 HRB. Most (97 percent) of the more than 40,000 Secano farmers are&#13;
small as defined by INDAP."9 More than a quarter of Chile's small farmers are located in&#13;

the Secano.20 21 Large producers, only 3 percent of Secano farmers, own more than 40&#13;
percent of the land. Average land holding size of larger farms decreases from north to&#13;
south, from 1,200 hectares to about 500 hectares.&#13;
2.6           About half the project beneficiaries are without full land title. Informal land&#13;
arrangements limit small farmers' access to services and benefits, such as: (i) forestry&#13;
subsidy; (ii) irrigation water rights and subsidies; (iii) housing construction subsidies; and&#13;
(iv) commercial credit. In addition, the absence of regularized land titles limits the efficient&#13;
operation of the rural land market and the formation of viably-sized family farms.&#13;
2.7           The Ministry of National Property (MBN), with partial funding from Bank&#13;
Small Farmer Services Project (Ln. 3473-CH), has a land titling component, intended to&#13;
regularize 43,500 new titles by the end of 1995.22 However, while the MBN's titling&#13;
program has improved, it is behind schedule due to logistical constraints, compounded by the&#13;
difficult nature of the outstanding cases. Recognizing that an effective titling program would&#13;
establish conditions for the success of the proposed project, MBN is to give special emphasis&#13;
to titling in the Secano, under the on-going Small Farmer Services Project. The proposed&#13;
project would help to remove some of the logistical constraints by providing MBN micro-&#13;
regional lists of project beneficiaries requiring MBN attention, detailing their location and&#13;
their title status.&#13;
Secano Producers&#13;
2.8            While delineating farmers according to farn size23 simplifies the diversity&#13;
among farmers, it highlights the principal characteristics of Secano farmers, especially those&#13;
of the small farmer - the project's target population. Large producers have more than 200&#13;
hectares, adequate capital resources and good managerial capacity. They not only apply&#13;
appropriate cropping patterns for their soil types and advanced production techniques, but&#13;
select production systems on the basis of natural resource endowment, relative profitability&#13;
and risk. Their average crop yields compare favorably with national levels. Frequently,&#13;
larger farmers delegate farm administrative responsibilities, while they pursue non-&#13;
agricultural, commercial activities elsewhere.&#13;

2.10           Potential project beneficiaries are small farmers with under 12 HRB.24 Given&#13;
the poor soils and the poverty of farmers in the Secano, farm size, expressed in HRB, was&#13;
considered to be a reasonable indicator for identifying small farmers, the project's target&#13;
population. Where soils are extremely poor, this could be equivalent to up to 200 physical&#13;
ha. But most farms with less than 5 HRB have less than 50 physical hectares. The highly&#13;
degraded soils of these farms are cultivated with family labor, using traditional technology.&#13;
Equipment and working capital are minimal. Commercial credit institutions are used rarely,&#13;
due to their onerous requirements.25&#13;
2.11           Increasingly, the economically active population, especially women, are&#13;
migrating to the urban centers, leaving behind the elderly and the very young. As a result,&#13;
in the Secano, the prevalence of women is lower than in the national population and the farm&#13;
population's average age, 36 years, is 40 percent older than the national level. Average&#13;
family size is 4.3, close to the rural average, and above the national average of 4.0.&#13;
Illiteracy rates in the Secano are the highest in Chile, reaching 19 percent. Formal education&#13;
level of the population over 18 years of age is less than 6 years, well below the national rural&#13;
average level (See Annex B).&#13;
2.12           Off-farm, non-agricultural activities have recently taken on greater importance&#13;
for small family farms. Many families supplement their off-farm income with agricultural&#13;
production for home consumption, leaving small marketing surpluses. Nevertheless, for&#13;
24.    For discussion on characteristics defining a small farmer, see, Cox (1984), op.cit.; Echefnique and&#13;
Rolando (1989), op.cit.; E. Ortega, "Peasant Agriculture in Latin America: Situations and Trends",&#13;

25.    The Small Farmer Survey carried out by the preparation team indicated that 20% of small farmers in&#13;
the Secano received credit from any source during 1992-93.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
poorer households, farm production consumed at home is crucial to their survival. Because&#13;
of their isolation, labor and product market linkages are weak, causing farmers to depend on&#13;
the sporadic visits of traders to sell their surpluses.&#13;
2.13         More than 40 percent of the Secano households are poor, with regional&#13;
incidence ranging from 27 percent, in Region VI to 46 percent in Region VIII. Of the rural&#13;
households, more than 55 percent live below the poverty line. Region VII has the highest&#13;
poverty incidence, with over 67 percent of its rural population living in poverty. Farm sales,&#13;
the largest cash income source, are derived from three sources, the sale of: (i) crops; (ii)&#13;
livestock; and (iii) handicrafts and processed agricultural products. Wages are the most&#13;
significant off-farm income source, accounting for 40 percent of off-farm income and a fifth&#13;
of monetary income. Nearly 45 percent of Secano households earned wage income (See&#13;
Annex B).&#13;
2.14         Annual cultivation of a small farm demands between 150 and 300 labor days.&#13;
Assuming that a small-farmer family could supply between 500 and 600 labor days per year,&#13;
current occupation level implies an under-utilization of family labor of between 50 percent&#13;
and 75 percent.26 For about 37 percent of the farm population over 15 years old, on-farm&#13;
work is their primary occupation. Less than 10 percent has permanent off-farm jobs.&#13;
Seasonal agricultural work is the second most important occupation for men. Women tend to&#13;
work in seasonal/occasional jobs or permanently in the service sector.&#13;
2.15         Small farmer Secano production systems are: (i) crops, alternating grain&#13;
legumes with wheat; or (ii) crops (wheat, legumes) combined with livestock, with a fallow&#13;
rotation followed by wheat. When the farm size permits, these are followed by three to five&#13;
years of natural pastures, mainly for draught animals and sheep. In the South, wine grapes&#13;
are important and, in the more humid zones, potatoes and beans are planted.&#13;
2.16         Small Secano farmers fall into three types defined according to income&#13;
sources.27 Type I corresponds to farmers who earn 65 percent or more of their cash income&#13;
from farm production, and who possess significant agricultural production potential. Type&#13;
II, the "transition farmer", obtains between 35 percent and 65 percent of cash income from&#13;
farm production. With appropriate support, these farmers could become efficient part-time&#13;
farmers, practicing sustainable natural resource management strategies. Finally, Type III,&#13;
the "off-farm producer", with the lowest commercial agriculture potential, receives less than&#13;
35 percent of cash income from farm production.&#13;

B. Development Potential and Constraints of the Small Farmer&#13;
2.17          The Secano's economic potential lies in the development of its forests and&#13;
pastures. With sufficient capital, investing in these areas could represent important economic&#13;
options for small farmers. Expanded irrigation could considerably increase crop production.&#13;
Given the region's topography, storing water run-offs with small basins could irrigate several&#13;
thousands of hectares. In those zones where irrigation is not feasible, production could be&#13;
enhanced through cost-effective rainfed farming techniques. Production and productivity&#13;
could be through land-intensive technologies which would reduce cultivated area, resulting in&#13;
land use patterns more suited to the available natural resources.&#13;
2.18          The poor natural resource base is a serious constraint to improving the&#13;
Secano's small farmers' household welfare. Farms are small with poor, fragile and degraded&#13;
soils. Insufficient water constrains production increases, with rainfall concentrated in the&#13;
period of least vegetative growth and disappearing during the period of crop ripening and&#13;
pasture growth. In many ares, the limited coverage and poor condition of the irrigation&#13;
system restrict the development of fruit, especially grape, production. In livestock&#13;
production-oriented micro-regions with relatively scarce rainfall, poor irrigation limits crop&#13;
production for home consumption. Throughout the Secano, training and technical assistance&#13;
could increase efficiency of on-farm irrigation.&#13;
2.19          Poverty limits small farmers' ability to adjust production patterns and cultural&#13;
practices in response to natural resource endowments and economic incentives. Household&#13;
survival dictates that highest priority be given to subsistence crop production, with little&#13;
regard for soil type or condition. Frequently, farmers need to cultivate steep slopes,&#13;
resulting in soil degradation and erosion. Poverty increases small farmers' reluctance to&#13;
experiment with novel cultivation practices, as such modification could fail, affect not only&#13;
the farm operations, but also the household's livelihood.&#13;
2.20          There is a dearth of ecologically viable production systems adapted to the&#13;
special Secano conditions. Despite INDAP's recent program shift towards subsistence&#13;
farmers, its coverage in the Secano is inadequate, dispersed and crop-specific. Poor&#13;
infrastructure, including post-harvest storage, processing and marketing, and all-weather rural&#13;
roads restrain regional development by impeding competitive market formations. Finally,&#13;
deficient social services, such as health. education, drinking water and electricity, depress the&#13;
welfare of the rural poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin and Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
3.1          Despite its substantial agro-forestry potential, the Secano is economically&#13;
depressed, with the highest incidence of rural poverty in Chile.28 The region has remained&#13;
beyond the reach of both the national economic growth and most social programs. Targeted&#13;
programs, together with economic growth, are needed to alleviate regional rural poverty.&#13;
3.2          The project's strategy would increase economic returns to land by promoting&#13;
soil conservation and production technologies capable of sustaining increased production and&#13;
income. Assistance would be given to farmers in the design and execution of production&#13;
systems compatible with land capabilities and natural resource conservation practices. In&#13;
zones with sufficient water resources, the project would promote technically and&#13;
economically viable irrigation works, crop intensification and diversification. The project&#13;
would: (i) establish cultivated pastures or improved natural pasture management; and (ii)&#13;
create forest plantations and enrich existing natural forests. Project-financed investments&#13;
would generate sufficient additional income to allow farmers to invest in their farms, on&#13;
better lowland soils, pastures and forestry.&#13;
3.3           The project's poverty alleviation strategy would combine on- and off-farm&#13;
activities to reverse natural resource deterioration and increase household income and welfare&#13;
on a sustainable basis. The relative importance of one type of activity over another would&#13;
depend on the beneficiaries' socio-economic characteristics and survival tactics. The strategy&#13;
would generate employment. thereby increasing incomes for under-employed rural families&#13;
and reducing their need to abuse natural resources. While beneficiaries would select project&#13;
off-farm activities, likely activities include handicrafts. cottage industries and small agro-&#13;
industries. Beneficiaries would be assisted in the preparation of employment-generating&#13;
investment proposals and, subsequently, provided resources for their implementation.&#13;
Project-financed training, complementing the development of off-farm activities, would equip&#13;
beneficiaries with skills for non-agricultural labor markets and developing micro-enterprises.&#13;
The project would rehabilitate rural feeder roads and address community-identified marketing&#13;
bottlenecks.&#13;
3.4          The project's poverty alleviation activities would address the needs of the&#13;
Secano's three small farmer types (see para 2.16). For Type I, households which draw most&#13;
of their income from on-farm production, the project would improve production patterns.&#13;
cultural practices and natural resource management. For Type II, households which combine&#13;
on-farn production with off-farm activities, the project would support the development of&#13;
small-scale forest plantations to improve natural resource management and appreciate land&#13;
assets. Additionally, off-farm activities would be promoted, utilizing surplus family labor to&#13;
28.    UNICEF, Una Propuesta de Clasificaci6n de las Comunas del Pais, Santiago, 1990&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
boost household income. Finally, for Type III, households which draw their income mainly&#13;
from off-farm activities, the project would raise productivity in the limited land areas suited&#13;
for subsistence crop and livestock production, and, more importantly, increase household&#13;
income through project-funded off-farm economic enterprises.&#13;
3.5           The project would support research for the development of production&#13;
techniques suited to the Secano's unique natural and socio-economic conditions, in particular,&#13;
adaptive research on moisture and nutrient conservation techniques. Emphasis would be&#13;
shifted towards production systems adapted to the small farmers' needs. As part of this&#13;
effort, the Project would finance an array of agricultural, forestry and agro-forestry research&#13;
activities. These would be carried out through a competitive award system among qualified&#13;
private and public research entities.&#13;
3.6           Because of women's critical role in household welfare,29 the project would&#13;
foster specific investments for women, enhancing their economic opportunities. Participatory&#13;
methodologies, such as gender analysis, would ensure that project-advanced activities would&#13;
not increase their burdens, but rather, their opportunities to earn additional household&#13;
income.&#13;
3.7           In support of the Government's decentralization effort, the project would&#13;
strengthen local government institutions, especially municipalities, citizen groups and&#13;
farmers' organizations, enabling them to assume project execution, monitoring and evaluation&#13;
responsibilities. The technical assistance provided to municipalities would strengthen their&#13;
capacity to prepare project proposals, facilitating their access to recently established&#13;
Government-financed Regional Development Funds.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
3.8           The Project would address rural poverty and natural resource degradation,&#13;
mutually reinforcing problems, through the development and validation of comprehensive&#13;
strategies which achieve sustainable rural poverty alleviation and economic growth through&#13;
increased family income and improved natural resource management.&#13;
3.9          The Secano's diverse and fragile resource base, along with a lack of effective&#13;
regional poverty alleviation strategies, argues for a project which can validate alternative&#13;
development approaches. The heterogeneity of Secano conditions calls for a micro-regional&#13;
approach, starting with pilot-scale sub-projects in representative areas to test the&#13;
technological, social and institutional actions considered to be most likely to succeed. The&#13;
project would develop viable strategies which would: (i) improve natural resource&#13;
management to reverse soil degradation and establish sustainable production systems; and (ii)&#13;
29.    About 17% of the surveyed households were headed by women, and more than 75% of the working&#13;
age women declared agricultural production as their primary or secondary activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
expand off-farm economic activities and improve economic infrastructure to diversify income&#13;
sources and boost regional development. The results of the micro-regional endeavors would&#13;
serve as economically viable and environmentally sound models for possible eventual larger&#13;
government-funded programs, covering a greater area of the Secano.&#13;
3.10           The project would directly benefit about 2,400 farm families, cultivating over&#13;
50,000 ha by: (a) enhancing natural resource management through sustainable small-scale&#13;
farming systems, where available resource endowments and economic conditions are&#13;
appropriate, through targeted applied research and technology transfer; (b) advancing&#13;
environmentally sound forestry activities and pasture management; (c) supporting land title&#13;
regularization; (d) increasing rural family income through: (i) increased crop productivity and&#13;
diversification into higher-valued crops; (ii) additional off-farm income and employment&#13;
generating economic activities; (iii) enhanced off-farm employment skills; and (iv) improved&#13;
infrastructure; (e) increasing participation of project beneficiaries and their municipalities in&#13;
development planning, management and execution; and (f) strengthening Government's&#13;
technical capacity for overall natural resource management.&#13;
C. Definition of the Micro-Regional Pilot Schemes&#13;
3.11           Through discussions with MINAGRI Regional Secretariats (SEREMIS),&#13;
INDAP's Regional Directors, municipal officials and professionals working in the Secano, 24&#13;
municipalities were selected within Regions VI through VIII for further study. Eligible&#13;
municipalities were (i) among Chile's 100 poorest30 (ii) representative of rural Secano, in&#13;
terms of demographic, economic and agro-ecological characteristics and (iii) reasonably&#13;
accessible by land. In addition, the municipalities needed to have good local leadership.&#13;
Following a subsequent screening, thirteen municipalities were selected as potential pilot&#13;
areas.&#13;
3.12           The preparation team visited these thirteen municipalities to assess the&#13;
suitability of their micro-regions for the natural resource management and sustainable&#13;
agricultural development programs.3' Regional distribution and a fair representation of the&#13;
coastal and inland zones were taken into consideration. A micro-region in each of these&#13;
thirteen municipalities was identified for further analysis. Based on these studies, seven&#13;
municipalities were selected as micro-regional pilot areas. The wide range in the&#13;

micro-regions would have: (i) a large proportion of agricultural land; (ii) a population largely composed&#13;
of small-farmers; (iii) natural, social and economic characteristics typical of the region; (iv) degraded&#13;
soils on a substantial area; and (v) an area of about 10,000 ha.&#13;

D. Summary Project Description&#13;
3.13          Project components would be: (a) Natural Resource Management and&#13;
Sustainable Agricultural Development; (b) Off-Farm Poverty Alleviation; (c) Support&#13;
Services; (d) Technical Assistance; (e) Land Title Regularization; and (f) Studies.&#13;
32.    Proposed micro-regions are described in Working Paper No. 5, op. cit.&#13;

E. Project Components&#13;
Natural Resource Management and Sustainable Agricultural Development&#13;
(US$14. 10 million, 40.3 percent of costs)34&#13;
3.14          This component would promote rational natural resource use and sustainable&#13;
agriculture in the seven selected micro-regions by supporting:35&#13;
(a)    small irrigation schemes to irrigate around 1,300 ha36 (US$4.45 million)&#13;
dispersed among the seven micro-regions, using primarily furrow-type&#13;
irrigation to enable small farmers to cultivate their limited areas of better&#13;
quality soils more intensively, thereby increasing productivity and reducing&#13;
erosion;&#13;
(b)    rainfed fanning techniques and on-farm erosion control (US$4.85 million),&#13;
including gully stabilization measures, on 3,700 ha, including 1,800 ha of&#13;
vineyards. Improvements would include: (i) introduction of improved seeds&#13;
and better adapted crop varieties; (ii) more rational fertilizer use and weed&#13;
control; (iii) introduction of practices to capture rainfall which by reducing&#13;
water run-off would decrease soil erosion; and (iv) improved land preparation&#13;
and cultivation techniques;&#13;
(c)    pasture and livestock production improvements (US$3. 10 million), including&#13;
the provision of fences, seeds and fertilizers for natural pasture management&#13;
(5,000 ha), and establishment of improved pasture (3,500 ha) on erosion-prone&#13;
lands;&#13;
(d)    forestry development (US$1.40 million)37 on very fragile lands, including:&#13;
silvo-pastoral development (2,800 ha), forestation (3,700 ha) and woodland&#13;
renovation (90 ha); and&#13;
(e)    incorporation of Secano natural resource management in MINAGRI's&#13;
geographic information system (GIS) (US$0.3 million).&#13;
34.    including contingencies.&#13;
35.    All the activities in this component, except forestry and GIS, would be financed through the PFAP (see&#13;
Annex D).&#13;
36.    Target areas for each sub-component are based on the assumption that about two-thirds of the small&#13;
farmers in the seven participating micro-regions would join the project activities.&#13;
37.    Short-term bridging loans provided by the project until receipt of CONAF funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Off-Farm Poverty Alleviation (US$7.55 million, 21.5 percent of costs)&#13;
3.15          This component would finance within the selected Municipalities: (i) off-farm&#13;
economic activities38 (US$5.00 million) proposed by beneficiaries, such as handicrafts,&#13;
cottage industries and agro-industries; and (ii) improvements in rural infrastructure, primarily&#13;
in rural feeder roads39 (US$2.05 million) and marketing facilities (US$0.5 million) (see&#13;
Annex I for details).&#13;
Support Services (US$6.75 million, 19.3 percent of costs)&#13;
3.16          This component would comprise: (a) technology transfer (see Annex H)&#13;
(US$2.30 million) adapted to small farmer needs, emphasizing natural resource management;&#13;
and (b) adaptive agricultural and forestry/agro-forestry research (see Annex G) (US$4.45&#13;
million) to modify and adapt technological packages tailored to Secano small farmner&#13;
conditions. Agreement was reached during negotiations on institutional arrangements that&#13;
would ensure adequate implementation of the agricultural and forestry research activities.&#13;
Technical Assistance (US$4.50 million, 12.9 percent of costs)&#13;
3.17          This would comprise: (a) technical assistance services (US$2.00 million) (see&#13;
Annex E); (b) institutional strengthening (US$1.50 million) for (i) municipalities and small&#13;
farner groups involved in project implementation; (ii) beneficiaries to participate in the&#13;
monitoring of natural resource use; and (iii) farmners' organizations; and (c) training&#13;
(US$1.00 million) for (i) beneficiaries at the micro-regional level; (ii) professionals attached&#13;
to each municipality; and (iii) firms contracted to implement the Natural Resource&#13;
Management activities.&#13;
Land Title Regularization&#13;
3.18          This component (see Annex J), to be financed by MBN as part of its land title&#13;
program within the Small Farmer Services Project (Loan 3473-CH), would regularize&#13;
property rights of 1, 190 farmers, or 85 percent of project beneficiaries with land titling&#13;
problems.&#13;
Studies (US$0.85 million, 2.4 percent of costs)&#13;
3.19          This component (see Annex K) would: (a) assess the Secano's renewable&#13;
natural resources, including a hydro-geological survey which would identify surface and&#13;
ground water sources; (b) draft guidelines for natural resource protection within MINAGRI&#13;
jurisdiction; and (c) analyze agricultural marketing constraints and options.&#13;
38.    A description of the proposed off-farm development activities is given in Working Paper No. 6:&#13;
FAO/CP, Proyectos de Desarrollo Extra-prediales.&#13;
39.    Excluding rural roads registered at the Highway Directorate of MOP, which would be rehabilitated and&#13;
maintained by MOP, under its own budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Project Technical Unit (US$1.25 million, 3.6 percent of costs)&#13;
3.20          This would finance the Project Technical Unit's (UTP), including: (i)&#13;
personnel; (ii) vehicles, office, computer and communication equipment; and (iii) operating&#13;
costs.&#13;
F. Project Costs&#13;
3.21          As interventions would be primarily beneficiary-defined, project activities' cost&#13;
estimates are indicative. The estimated project cost, including contingencies, taxes and&#13;
duties, is US$35.00 million equivalent, of which about US$3.10 million equivalent (or 8.9&#13;
percent 40) represents foreign exchange costs. Price contingencies, estimated at US$1.74&#13;
million equivalent (5.3 percent of baseline costs), have been included at an annual rate of 2.5&#13;
percent between 1996 and 2000. Physical contingencies, except for technical assistance,&#13;
studies, vehicles, research and technology transfer, have been estimated at US$0.44 million&#13;
equivalent, based on 5 percent contingencies on civil works and equipment, and 10 percent&#13;
on the training component. Project cost tables are presented in Annex N. Estimated project&#13;
costs are summarized below.&#13;
3.22          Locally procured goods are subject to a value-added tax (VAT) of 18 percent.&#13;
Imported goods, such as vehicles and computers, are subject to an 11 percent customs tax&#13;
and the VAT. The total project cost includes approximately US$2.5 million equivalent in&#13;
local duties and taxes.&#13;
G. Financing Plan&#13;
3.23          The proposed US$15 million Bank loan to the Govermment of Chile would be&#13;
at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans, for a term of&#13;
15 years, including five years of grace. Chile is eligible for SCL loans since the Republic of&#13;
Chile has no unconverted VLR 82 loans and the amount of the proposed SCL loan falls&#13;
within the amount in the approved guidelines. The Government's rationale for its choice is&#13;
the current character of Chile's foreign trade and its future prospects, strongly associated&#13;
with the generation of this currency (US$), an issue that will facilitate payment commitments&#13;
stemming from this Loan Agreement.&#13;
3.24          The proposed loan would finance about 45 percent of total costs, net of taxes&#13;
and duties. Bank financing would cover: (a) 50 percent of expenditures on civil works; (b)&#13;
40.    The project's foreign exchange costs are relatively low because 48 percent of total project costs,&#13;
amounting to US$15.85 million, has no foreign exchange component. Sustainable Agricultural&#13;
Development activities and technical assistance (excluding studies), training and support services, would&#13;
be provided primarily by national consultants.&#13;

Recurrent expenditures (US$2.75 million - except US$0.31 million for the operation of the&#13;
UTP), as well as duties and taxes (US$2.50 million) would be solely financed by the&#13;
Government. The Government presented evidence at negotiations that it has established a&#13;
project account for an amount sufficient to cover estimated expenditures for 1996, in&#13;
accordance with the Annual Work Plan (POA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Institutional Arrangements41&#13;
4.1         The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) would have overall project authority.&#13;
INDAP would be the Executing Agency, while its National Director, through the Project&#13;
Technical Unit (UTP), would manage the project. The UTP would provide technical,&#13;
managerial and administrative support in all project implementation matters. The UTP&#13;
would have staff responsibilities and functions established in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
The UTP would manage the Program for Financing Poverty Alleviation Activities (PFAP)&#13;
and would administer its resources. A Project Commission (Comite Superior de Proyecto,&#13;
CSP) would be established, whose permanent membership would include the Director of&#13;
INDAP, who would be the Commission's chairman, the Director of ODEPA, as well as the&#13;
Administrators (Intendentes) of the three regions covered by the project. Representatives of&#13;
various entities, such as MBN, MOP, CNR, INIA, CONAF and MIDEPLAN, would be&#13;
invited to participate in the CSP debates, as recommended by its chairman. The Project&#13;
Commission's responsibilities would be to provide guidance on the strategy for project&#13;
implementation and make recommendations on the Annual Work Programs (POAs) and their&#13;
corresponding budgets; rules, procedures and operational mechanisms of PFAP; and&#13;
guidelines for studies and technical assistance. The Commission would also review the&#13;
project's progress and its degree of beneficiary participation. The Minister of Agriculture&#13;
would have the responsibility and authority to reconcile differences among members of the&#13;
Commission. At negotiations, the Government presented to the Bank draft legal and&#13;
administrative arrangements for the establishment of the CSP and the UTP. Agreement on&#13;
these was reached at negotiations. Final arrangements, acceptable to the Bank, would be&#13;
forwarded to the Bank as a condition of Loan Effectiveness.&#13;
4.2         A Local Development Council (CDL) would be formed in each municipality&#13;
to link beneficiaries, municipalities and the UTP. The CDL would become the forum for&#13;
project beneficiaries to voice their demands. It would include representatives of the&#13;
beneficiaries and their organizations, the municipality, INDAP and the relevant public&#13;
institutions which have activities on the local level (for details, see Annex C). Local&#13;
consultative groups would be established to provide beneficiaries and municipalities ample&#13;
opportunity to express and adequately channel their opinions to the respective agencies.&#13;
4.3         In the area of their respective competence, relevant public entities (such as&#13;
MOP, CNR, INIA, CONAF and INFOR) would be invited by the UTP to participate in&#13;
specific project activities and would: (i) strengthen and coordinate their programs in the&#13;
project municipalities with project activities; and (ii) collaborate with UTP in: (a)&#13;
procurement procedures; (b) preparation of terms of reference and methodologies; (c)&#13;
41.   An organizational chart is provided at the end of Annex C, Institutional Aspects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
selection of consultants; and (d) supervision, follow-up and technical evaluation of the&#13;
activities developed by implementing firms.&#13;
4.4          With project assistance, the selected seven municipalities would participate in&#13;
project execution, monitoring and evaluation. In collaboration with MOP and contracted&#13;
specialists, the municipalities would manage infrastructure investments.&#13;
4.5          A project funded-professional, assigned to each selected Municipality, would:&#13;
(i) contribute to the formulation of the project's on- and off-farm activities; (ii) support&#13;
project implementation activities in accordance with the established implementation strategy&#13;
and the approved POAs; (iii) promote project activities among beneficiaries and local&#13;
authorities; (iv) support and coordinate institutional strengthening activities for the&#13;
municipality, according to a program jointly prepared with the municipality; (v) support the&#13;
coordination among the various public entities participating in local-level project activities;&#13;
and (vi) enhance beneficiary organizations' activities through technical assistance and&#13;
training.&#13;
4.6          Working with beneficiaries, firms (local consulting firms, universities or&#13;
NGOs) would design and execute the micro-regional natural resource management and&#13;
agricultural development programs. As required, individual farmers or farmer groups would&#13;
participate in the contracting of the firms to execute program activities. To support project&#13;
activities, firms would promote producers' organizations. Firms' compensation would be&#13;
based on their performance and targets they reach. Off-farm investment proposals would be&#13;
carried out by beneficiaries, with the assistance of UTP and/or local consulting firms.&#13;
Beneficiaries could hire project-financed consultants as supervisors.&#13;
B. Program for Financing Poverty Alleviation Activities (PFAP)&#13;
4.7           This program would finance sustainable agriculture on-farm activities and&#13;
economically viable off-farm activities. The on-farm activities, which would mainly benefit&#13;
groups of two or more farmers, would include small-scale irrigation, rural infrastructure and&#13;
natural resource conservation practices. The off-farm activities would be economically&#13;
sustainable enterprises designed to generate local employment opportunities and alternative&#13;
income sources (See Annex D).&#13;
4.8           The Program's interventions would be highly targeted, as beneficiary&#13;
municipalities are among Chile's 100 poorest. In addition, the program's on-farm activities&#13;
would be primarily targeted to those farmers with less than 20 physical hectares (or less than&#13;
about 5 ha equivalent of Class I irrigated land).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
4.9           PFAP funds for improving natural resource management and promoting&#13;
sustainable agricultural development would be available to all interested small producers42&#13;
located in the selected municipalities, but with preference given to those in the micro-regions&#13;
chosen within each municipality (see para. 3.14 (a) to (c)). PFAP off-farm activity funds, on&#13;
the other hand, would be available to all members of the selected municipalities (see Annex&#13;
D for details).&#13;
4.10          Potential beneficiaries would submit investment proposals to CDL. CDL&#13;
would assess the proposal's suitability and development potential. Once accepted by CDL,&#13;
the proposal would be passed to UTP to solicit funds for financing feasibility studies. Local&#13;
consultants, contracted and supervised by the UTP, would conduct the feasibility studies.&#13;
Upon review of the feasibility study's findings, potential beneficiaries would make necessary&#13;
modifications and re-submit the proposal to the UTP for final review, approval and&#13;
financing.&#13;
4.11          UTP would finance firms to prepare feasibility studies, and prepare and&#13;
execute on-farm development plans. Funds for approved on-farm investment proposals&#13;
(excluding forestation) would be channelled by PFAP to beneficiaries through local INDAP&#13;
offices .&#13;
4.12          UTP would approve PFAP-financed off-farm projects with costs of less than&#13;
US$100,000. For these off-farm investments, funds would be channelled from PFAP to the&#13;
beneficiaries through regular INDAP channels. Investments exceeding US$100,000 would&#13;
require the approval of the Director of INDAP, upon recommendations of the CSP. INDAP&#13;
could provide financial support to beneficiaries seeking to participate in a joint venture with&#13;
interested private investors.&#13;
4.13          Beneficiaries' contributions for investment activities would be either from their&#13;
resources (especially, labor) or credit. Commercial financing would be facilitated by a&#13;
FOSIS (or similar) program which, not only guarantees loans, but also compensates banks&#13;
for the higher transaction cost of loans extended to small- and medium-sized investors in&#13;
remote areas.&#13;
4.14          The financial packages between PFAP and beneficiaries would include partial&#13;
capital cost recovery schemes for productive investments. Debt would be collected by&#13;
INDAP and returned to the Treasury. The interest rate would be the Central Bank's long-&#13;
term paper rate (the same rate used in the Irrigation Development Project, PROMM).&#13;
Agreement was reached during negotiations on capital cost recovery levels for the PFAP-&#13;
financed sub-project categories. These would be specified in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
42.    For the project purposes, small producers are those who fall within INDAP's farm size and capital&#13;
limits (see footnote no. 6).&#13;
43.    On-farm investment funds (which would not involve loan funds) would be transferred in vouchers,&#13;
exchangeable for agricultural inputs and equipment, or cash. Conditions specifying which form the&#13;
funds would be transferred would be described in the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
While the UTP would assume responsibility for the PFAP-funded projects' execution,&#13;
agreement was reached during negotiations to include in the Implementation Manual&#13;
guidelines to identify those projects which would be supervised by consultants or MOP&#13;
regional offices.&#13;
C. Forestry Development&#13;
4.15         The project would support forest plantations, including plantations for silvo-&#13;
pastoral production, financed through CONAF program under the Forestry Development&#13;
Law. Short-term bridging loans would be provided by the project and managed by the UTP,&#13;
to facilitate the forestry activities until the participants would receive the corresponding&#13;
CONAF funding.&#13;
D. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.16         Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E), based on the Annual Work Program's&#13;
(POA) objectives and targets, would allow CSP, UTP and the Bank to evaluate project's&#13;
progress. The UTP would prepare annual POAs for CSP and Bank review, and would&#13;
submit to the Bank a satisfactory POA by March 31, starting in 1997. Agreement on this&#13;
respect was reached during negotiations. The draft 1996 POA was submitted to the Bank&#13;
as a condition of negotiations and agreed during negotiations. Submission of the final&#13;
POA for 1996 is a condition for Loan Effectiveness. Further, UTP would present to the&#13;
Bank, not later than March 15 of each year, starting in 1997, an annual report on the&#13;
implementation progress during the preceding year. Prior to submission to the Bank, the&#13;
report would be provided to the CSP for its review. Assurances to this effect were given&#13;
by the Borrower during negotiations. The UTP would monitor and implement&#13;
recommendations of the investment proposals' environmental M&amp;E. Finally, assurances&#13;
were given bv the Borrower during negotiations that a project monitoring system,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, would be established no later than August 31, 1996.&#13;
4. 17        Annual reviews would be held not later than April 30 of every year, starting in&#13;
1997. and the Mid-Term Review (MTR) would take place not later than April 30 of 1998.&#13;
Both the MTRs and annual reviews would analyze each component against implementation&#13;
and impact indicators,44 including changes in household income (see Annex L), as well as&#13;
assess the validity of the Micro-Regional Pilot Project's concept. These would evaluate the&#13;
dialogue with beneficiaries, financial support, and coordination with CSP. Depending upon&#13;
the findings of the beneficiary participation assessments, the project could be adjusted at its&#13;
44.   Implementation and impact indicators would be revised periodically and adjusted, as needed, to&#13;
improve their correspondence to the project implementation progress and the conditions of the&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
MTRs and annual reviews. Agreement on the scope and content of the annual and mid-term&#13;
reviews was reached during negotiations. These will be specified in the Implementation&#13;
Manual. A description of the supervision schedule, project launch workshop, annual POA&#13;
and budget review, and annual progress evaluation missions is presented in the Supervision&#13;
Plan (Annex M).&#13;
4.18        The MTR would validate the design assumption in light of implementation&#13;
experience and undertake necessary adjustments in project objectives, design, and&#13;
implementation arrangements. An Evaluation Report would be conducted by independent&#13;
consultants, acceptable to the Bank, to be submitted to the Bank not later than March 31,&#13;
1998, and would recommend adjustments and a schedule for their adoption.&#13;
4.19        Ex-post project evaluation would assess project's technical performance and&#13;
socio-economic impact. These evaluations would be contracted to consulting firms, NGOs,&#13;
or university research centers. UTP would prepare terms of reference, agreed upon by CSP&#13;
and Bank.&#13;
E. Project Implementation Manual&#13;
4.20        As agreed with the Government, the Project Implementation Manual would&#13;
include: (i) operating procedures for project implementation; (ii) terms and conditions for&#13;
the financing of natural resource management and sustainable agricultural development&#13;
activities; (iii) criteria for off-farm beneficiaries' eligibility; (iv) procurement procedures in&#13;
general, and selection of consultants for carrying out the agricultural and forestry/agro-&#13;
forestry research activities in particular; (v) arrangements among INDAP, off-farm&#13;
beneficiaries and other agencies participating in project execution; (vi) scope and content of&#13;
MTRs and annual reviews; (vii) project economic and environmental monitoring indicators&#13;
and targets; (viii) design and execution procedures for: (a) micro-regional on-farm&#13;
development programs; and (b) the PFAP, including sub-project selection criteria, covering&#13;
expected economic, social and environmental impacts; and (ix) TORs for: (a) the&#13;
implementation of Natural Resource Management and Agricultural Development component;&#13;
and (b) key UTP personnel.&#13;
4.21        A draft Implementation Manual was submitted to the Bank as a condition of&#13;
negotiations and agreed during negotiations. As a condition of effectiveness, a final&#13;
Implementation Manual, acceptable to the Bank, would be adopted by INDAP. The Manual&#13;
would be the principal document for the Project Launch Workshop, scheduled for January&#13;
1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
F. Procurement&#13;
4.22         Based on INDAP's good past performance and demonstrated capabilities in&#13;
implementing and supervising procurement, INDAP would be fully responsible for all&#13;
procurement under the proposed project. Agreement was reached with the Government&#13;
during negotiations that: (i) project components45 financed under the proposed Bank loan&#13;
would be procured in accordance with the Bank Procurement Guidelines (January 1995); and&#13;
(ii) Standard Bidding Documents, acceptable to the Bank, would be used for contracting&#13;
works under NCB procedures. Early agreement on the use of standard documents for NCB,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, is essential, given that Chile does not have a procurement law and&#13;
that bidding documents are the main regulatory instrument for public procurement.&#13;
Government agencies/institutions have great latitude for issuing their own procurement&#13;
regulations as long as they are endorsed by the Comptroller General's office.&#13;
(a)    Civil Works. These would consist primarily of: (a) rehabilitation of rural&#13;
feeder roads; (b) construction of small irrigation schemes; and (c) farm,&#13;
pasture and forest land improvements. Civil works contracts for roads and&#13;
irrigation, estimated to cost at US$350,000 or more, totaling about US$2.20&#13;
million equivalent, would be awarded on the basis of NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Price quotation procedures would be used for civil&#13;
works contracts less than US$350,000. up to an aggregate amount of US$3. 10&#13;
million.46&#13;
(b)   Goods would include computers, office and communication equipment, and&#13;
vehicles to be used by the UTP. All goods contracts are expected to be under&#13;
US$100,000 and would be procured through shopping procedures, that is,&#13;
based on price quotations from at least three suppliers acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(c)    Services. Support services, preparation of studies and designs, institutional&#13;
strengthening, technical assistance and training activities, and UTP personnel,&#13;
amounting to about US$12.85 million equivalent, would be carried out by&#13;
national and foreign consultants, contracted in accordance with Guidelines on&#13;
the Use of Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers and by the World&#13;
Bank as Executive Agency (August 1981), using Bank standard contract&#13;
forms for complex assignments.&#13;
(d)   Due to the demand-driven nature of the PFAP-financed off-farm investment&#13;
component, neither the distribution nor composition of the contracts funded&#13;
45.   Only goods within the PFAP financed off-farm activities and those for the operation of the UTP would&#13;
be financed through the Loan.&#13;
46.   Procured on the basis of lump sum fixed price contracts awarded through a comparison of a minimum&#13;
of three quotations from qualified firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
under this component could be specified in advance. Nevertheless, as the&#13;
beneficiary ceiling is US$100,000, these contracts are expected to be relatively&#13;
small. Firms, selected by INDAP with beneficiary participation, would carry&#13;
out procurement under this component. The firms would apply private-sector&#13;
commercial practices and award contracts on a competitive basis.&#13;
(e)   Review of Procurement. Bank review of procurement documents for all&#13;
contracts for works costing US$350,000 or more would be required.&#13;
Contracts for works and goods costing less than US$350,000, including PFAP&#13;
off-farm financed investments, would be reviewed by the Bank on an ex-post&#13;
basis during supervision.&#13;
(f)    Terms of reference for consultant services would be subject to Bank prior&#13;
review. Prior review of selection and contractual documents would be&#13;
required for all contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or&#13;
above for consulting firms, and US$50,000 or above for individual&#13;
consultants, and for assignments of a critical nature, as determined by the&#13;
Bank. Contracts for consulting services estimated at below US$100,000 for&#13;
firms, or below US$50,000 for individual consultants, respectively, in an&#13;
aggregate not exceeding US$3.0 million, would be reviewed ex-post, on a&#13;
sampling basis.&#13;
(g)   To assure that adequate procurement procedures are used, the UTP would&#13;
make cost comparisons of similar activities in the seven micro-regions, using&#13;
the project monitoring system to detect possible procurement problems. The&#13;
UTP would review all procurement procedures, documents, bid evaluations&#13;
and contract awards during the entire implementation period.&#13;
(h)   Following the procedures defined above, the Bank would review ex-ante about&#13;
60 percent of the total value of the Bank-financed contracts.&#13;

G. Disbursements&#13;
4.23                The proceeds of the proposed loan are expected to be disbursed in accordance&#13;
with the schedule shown in Annex P, Table 1, over a period of 4.5 years, which is shorter&#13;
than the average country profile for Chile (5.5 years). The disbursement period was&#13;
determined after taking into account the pilot characteristics of this project and the yearly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
budget amounts were agreed upon with the Ministry of Finance. The allocation and&#13;
disbursement of the Bank loan are summarized in Annex P, Table 2.47&#13;
4.24        The project completion date is May 31, 2000 and the closing date is November&#13;
30, 2000. To facilitate project implementation, the Government would establish a Special&#13;
Account in the Central Bank or a commercial bank, acceptable to the Bank, to cover&#13;
expenditures eligible for Bank financing under the project to be managed by the Head of the&#13;
UTP. The authorized allocation for the Special Account would be US$1.0 million, with an&#13;
initial authorized allocation to be made of US$0.5 million, and a full amount of authorized&#13;
allocation to be released when disbursements reach a level of US$5.0 million.&#13;
Disbursements would be made under authorized signatures from a designated representative&#13;
of the Borrower. Assurances were given by the Borrower during negotiations that&#13;
withdrawal applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be prepared by the&#13;
UTP in accordance with Bank policies and procedures. Disbursements would be made on&#13;
the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for all expenses except those covered by&#13;
contracts requiring prior review by the Bank. Therefore, disbursements for all contracts for&#13;
civil works and goods of less than $350,000 equivalent and consulting services by firms and&#13;
individuals of less than $100,000 and $50,000 respectively would be made on the basis of&#13;
SOEs certified by the UTP. Disbursement for contracts requiring prior review would be&#13;
fully documented. Relevant documentation in support of SOEs would not be submitted to the&#13;
Bank, but would be retained by the UTP and would be made available to Bank supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
4.25        Retroactive financing for expenditures incurred after December 31, 1995 (but&#13;
not earlier than 12 months before loan signing) in an amount not to exceed US$180,000&#13;
equivalent (1.2 percent of the Loan amount) is recommended. This would facilitate the&#13;
financing of start-up UTP activities, to be financed 100% out of the proceeds of the Loan.&#13;
H. Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.26        The Project Technical Unit (UTP) would maintain project accounts and be&#13;
accountable for the funds used by the various entities involved in project execution. These&#13;
accounts would be maintained in accordance with sound accounting procedures, acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. An accounting plan was submitted to the Bank prior to negotiations. Project&#13;
accounts, along with the Special Account and Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), would be&#13;
audited by independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank, according to Bank-approved terms&#13;
of reference. Audited financial statements would be submitted to the Bank, with an audit&#13;
report, within six months after the end of each fiscal year. Assurances to this effect were&#13;
obtained at negotiations. By no later than two months after Loan Effectiveness, the&#13;
47.   This loan disbursement arrangement, tailored to the expected pace of project execution, conforms to the&#13;
recently amended Operational Directive (OD) 12.00, Disbursements, para. 26.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Borrower would establish a system of accounts for the project acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1         The project would contribute to a coherent strategy for rural poverty&#13;
alleviation and sustainable resource management in the Secano. Financial support, technical&#13;
assistance and technology development and transfer based on the demands of small farmers&#13;
in selected, representative areas, would serve as a basis for the design of a rural poverty&#13;
alleviation strategy. If successful, the strategies could be extended throughout the Secano.&#13;
Given the project's small size relative to the magnitude to regional poverty, the project could&#13;
be viewed as a precursor to possible larger Government-financed programs needed to reach&#13;
the entire Secano population. The proposed project would increase incomes of beneficiaries,&#13;
through enhanced employment opportunities and agricultural production. The project would&#13;
encourage government decentralization, strong beneficiary and municipal participation in&#13;
discovering solutions for their priority issues, and coordination of the activities of various&#13;
agencies currently providing basic services in the Secano.&#13;
B. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.2           The project would improve the production patterns of about 22,000 ha of&#13;
1,100 small farmers (out of 2,425 within the seven selected micro-regions; see Annex 0 for&#13;
assumptions regarding adoption rates) and develop sustainable small farmer production&#13;
systems consistent with land capabilities. Area under annual crops would be reduced by at&#13;
least 3,400 ha, concentrated on better soils and diversified into higher-value crops. Project-&#13;
financed irrigation works on 1,300 ha would increase cropping intensities. On 3,700 non-&#13;
irrigable ha, the project would introduce rainfed cultivation practices aimed at proper soil and&#13;
water conservation. Additionally, the project would improve vineyard cultivation practices to&#13;
avoid soil erosion and introduce grape varieties with higher market value about 1,800 ha&#13;
under grapes, the Secano's most profitable crop, .&#13;
5.3         By promoting commodities for which there is strong domestic and export&#13;
demand, the project would integrate a relatively marginal region into the main economy.&#13;
The project area is expected to produce annually over US$2.6 million of vegetables and&#13;
pulses for domestic markets. In addition, US$3.0 million of wine and nearly US$1.0 million&#13;
of lamb would be produced, an important share of which would be exported. Additionally,&#13;
project-promoted forestry activities would produce US$36.0 million of roundwood or posts&#13;
for local fruit industry, and US$27.0 million of pulpwood for the pulp industry, throughout&#13;
the project's life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
5.4           Estimated internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the natural resource&#13;
management and sustainable agricultural development component and the rural feeder roads&#13;
sub-component (including the costs of the technology transfer program and the UTP) is 20.7&#13;
percent. The IERR includes economic benefits derived from: (i) crop productivity gains,&#13;
resulting from improved practices; (ii) crop diversification into higher-valued crops; (iii)&#13;
decreased production costs; and (iv) reduced marketing margins, due to better rural&#13;
infrastructure. These were applied to indicative farm models, representative of project&#13;
beneficiaries in the Secano.48&#13;
5.5           During the first year of implementation, participation in the project's natural&#13;
resource component of between 5% and 10% of the small farmers in the selected micro-&#13;
regions is expected. Participation would increase in subsequent years, until the project's fifth&#13;
year, when an estimated 47 percent of small farmers in the selected micro-region would&#13;
participate in the project. Relatively high participation rates are expected due to the: (i)&#13;
farmers' interest expressed in the participatory diagnosis carried out during project&#13;
preparation; (ii) attractive incentive packages offered; (iii) relatively low risk the production&#13;
packages represent to farmers' subsistence; and (iv) high probability of successful&#13;
implementation due to system-oriented technical assistance. Moreover, the project's&#13;
flexibility in implementation would allow for design adjustments to remove constraints to&#13;
farmers' adoption.&#13;
5.6           This IERR is very conservative as it does not consider important non-&#13;
quantitative benefits, such as those stemming from (i) reduced soil run-off and erosion; and&#13;
(ii) containment of progressive productivity losses due to declining soil fertility.&#13;
Furthermore, the analysis did not capture "without project" productivity loses (as a project&#13;
benefit) due to declining soil fertility.&#13;
5.7           For the off-farm investment component, as beneficiaries would determine&#13;
which activities would be financed under this component, an ex-ante estimation of costs and&#13;
benefits was made by analyzing a sample of likely off-farm projects. The preparation team&#13;
found that most proposals would be small, ranging between US$25,000 and US$100,000,&#13;
and economically highly feasible, having estimated internal economic rates of return&#13;
exceeding 25%. Since only technically and economically sound proposals would receive&#13;
project finance, this component would likely increase the project's internal economic rate of&#13;
return. To ensure economic viability, a minimum threshold of an estimated internal&#13;
economic rate of return would be applied as a selection criteria to sub-project proposals.&#13;
5.8           Significant benefits would be derived from other project components (technical&#13;
assistance, institutional strengthening, research and studies), including improved beneficiary&#13;
capacity to implement off-farm economic activities, support to Government decentralization,&#13;
as well as research for developing the Secano. But, because of the longer-term realization&#13;
48.    See Floto, E., E. Gacit6a, J. Garcia-Huidobro, M. Raczynski, and V. Silvestri, Una Propuesta de&#13;
Desarrollo Silvo-Agropecuario Sostenible para las Micro-Regiones del Secano, Working Paper No.&#13;
5, (Rome: FAO/CP).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
and inherent externalities of these benefits, IERRs for these investments could not be&#13;
estimated.&#13;
C. Environmental Impact&#13;
5.9         As improved natural resource management would be the project's most&#13;
important poverty alleviation mechanism, a significant project benefit would be the positive&#13;
environmental impact stemming from more rational land use. Where agricultural production&#13;
would be intensified, chemical use would be scrutinized, minimizing potential negative&#13;
impacts. Virtually all road works under the project would involve improved drainage,&#13;
bridges and resurfacing, conforming to acceptable engineering standards and having&#13;
consequent positive environmental impact.&#13;
5.10        The project has been rated "B" on the grounds that it may be necessary to&#13;
design mitigative measures for environmental protection against project activities.&#13;
Environmental impact assessments (EIA) of natural resource management and agricultural&#13;
development programs have been carried out by specialized consultants, contracted with&#13;
Bank-acceptable TORs and under the supervision of an experienced environment specialist&#13;
(See Annex F). The EIAs indicated that further environmental impact studies were&#13;
unnecessary. As specified in the Project Implementation Manual, the UTP Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation Department's, through contracted firms, would perform environmental M&amp;E of&#13;
project activities, giving particular attention to environmental implications of PFAP-financed&#13;
investment proposals.&#13;
5.11        For purposes of consultation, a draft summary environmental report would be&#13;
prepared and circulated for comment to CONAMA, to national NGOs and, later, to each&#13;
Local Development Committee. Based on response, the UTP could convene with interested&#13;
parties, especially NGOs.&#13;
D. Impact on Women and Youth&#13;
5.12        Eager to participate in income-generating programs, Secano women often&#13;
cannot due to logistical constraints and their pressing responsibilities at home. The project is&#13;
expected to strengthen women's position within the community, increase their access to job&#13;
opportunities within the micro-region and elsewhere, and improve their skills for developing&#13;
micro-enterprises. High-value land-intensive crops (tomatoes, flowers, strawberries), and&#13;
small artisan shops and "cottage" industries are especially likely to help women earn more&#13;
income as many of these activities can be integrated into their regular home and family&#13;
obligations. While not exclusively targeted towards them, women are expected to be the&#13;
primary beneficiaries of the Off-Farm Poverty Alleviation activities (see. para. 3.14).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
5.13         The project would address the Secano youth's need for employment and&#13;
training. Project-promoted intensive production systems are expected to increase labor&#13;
demand. Also, the project's off-farm activities would employ surplus family labor,&#13;
particularly young people. Nevertheless, project activities would not absorb all surplus labor&#13;
and migration will continue. In this vein, the training component would increase youth's&#13;
labor skills, allowing them to better compete in regional/national labor markets.&#13;
5.14         In this regard, the project would greatly profit from INDAP's impressive&#13;
progress promoting the participation of women and youth in its programs. Instead of&#13;
creating additional, narrowly-targeted programs, INDAP's strategy has been to increase the&#13;
access of women and youth to its existing programs, such as credit and technology transfer.&#13;
Institutional reforms have supported this promising approach, including the modification of&#13;
INDAP's law to recognize all family members of the head of household as eligible&#13;
beneficiaries of INDAP's programs. Further, INDAP has created a new Rural Development&#13;
Department with a sub-department for rural women and youth and has appointed additional&#13;
professionals to address their issues. Finally, a committee has been formed within INDAP to&#13;
analyze and, if necessary, revise programs to incorporate the gender perspective.&#13;
E. Risks&#13;
5.15         Weak local institutional capacity could jeopardize Project sustainability. The&#13;
Project's program to strengthen local institutional planning, management and budgeting&#13;
capabilities is expected to reduce this risk. Without adequate targeted agricultural and&#13;
forestry research, the project's technology transfer component would be severely hampered.&#13;
At negotiations the Government reiterated its commitment to adequately fund research&#13;
activities (see para. 3.23).&#13;
5.16         Project success would rest on: (i) producer's acceptance; and (ii) a financial&#13;
mechanism which would be both responsive to beneficiary demands and willing to assume&#13;
part of the investment's risks. Engaging potential beneficiaries in designing production&#13;
systems and other measures to overcome their development constraints is expected to&#13;
generate project acceptance by small farmers. The PFAP would be the financial mechanism&#13;
which would address the second element by: (i) financing, rapidly and efficiently, beneficiary&#13;
proposals for on-farm development and off-farm activities; and (ii) assuming investment risk,&#13;
during the initial stages, by providing grants for some activities and co-financing for others,&#13;
depending on investment type and beneficiary's economic situation.&#13;

CHILE&#13;
SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Characteristics of the Secano'&#13;
A. Natural Resources&#13;
Climate&#13;
1.    Rainfall in the Secano is poorly distributed, with a dry period lasting one to eight&#13;
months, becoming shorter as one moves south. Average annual rainfall is between 350 mm&#13;
and 1,200 mm, occurring in the winter when lower temperatures limit plant growth. Intense&#13;
initial rains provoke erosion. Rainfall varies greatly from year to year. Periodically, there&#13;
can be up to three consecutive years of drought, incurring great agricultural production&#13;
losses. The sea moderates temperatures in coastal zones, extending 15 km inland. Humid&#13;
and frost-free conditions in these areas are relatively favorable for agricultural development.&#13;
Soils&#13;
2.    In the Secano, soils are: granitic (32%), metamorphic (32%), marine terraces (18%)&#13;
and alluvial (18%). Granitic and metamorphic soils, without vegetative protection in the dry&#13;
summer months are vulnerable to erosion by the intense first rains. This, along with its&#13;
uneven topography, explains the Secano's high incidence of erosion.&#13;
3.    With few exceptions, Secano soils have low fertility and are mostly suited for&#13;
forestry. According to USBR soil classification, 62% of soils is Class VII, 15% is Class VI&#13;
and only 19% is arable land, i.e., soils in Class I to IV. Only the soils of the marine&#13;
terraces have medium or greater depth and good moisture-retaining capacity. With adequate&#13;
management and heavy fertilization, farmers obtain reasonable yields on these soils.&#13;
Water&#13;
4.    The main rivers in project area are the Aconcagua, Maipo, Rapel, Mataquito, Maule,&#13;
Itata and Bio Bio. The Aconcagua river irrigates the Aconcagua valley, while the remaining&#13;
rivers and their tributaries irrigate Chile's Central Valley. These rivers generally go through&#13;
1.    This annex refers to the entire Secano, stretching from Region V in the North to Region X in the&#13;
South.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -                                Annex A&#13;
deep and narrow valleys, irrigating only small strips of alluvial soils along the river banks.&#13;
Most pernanent irrigation water rights from these rivers have been allocated. Future&#13;
agricultural development programs could use water for irrigation from these rivers only&#13;
during surplus periods. Some of the areas identified by the National Irrigation Commission&#13;
(Comisi6n Nacional de Riego - CNR) as having irrigation potential, such as Convento Viejo,&#13;
Cuncumen and Las Brisas, are in the Secano and are being developed under the Irrigation&#13;
Development Project (PROMM).2&#13;
5.    The best sources of small volumes of water for irrigation in the Secano are the small&#13;
ravines coming down from the higher parts of the Cordillera de la Costa (Coastal Mountain&#13;
Range) and, to a lesser extent, drainage water formn marshes in the flat areas. Most ravines&#13;
are dry by the end of spring and, consequently, their use for irrigation would require the&#13;
construction of small dams to harvest winter and spring rainfall. The area's topography&#13;
offers suitable places for the small dams, using run-off from mini-basins of up to 30 km2.&#13;
While underground water sources are apparently scarce, they could be important for the&#13;
development of certain micro-regions. According to the Hydro-geologic Atlas prepared by&#13;
MOP's General Directorate of Water, Secano's groundwater resources are along the rivers&#13;
and the coast. Those along the rivers are boxed in, usually with broken stone and thick&#13;
material. Wells drilled along the Maipo, Itata and Mataquito rivers are between 13 and 14&#13;
meters deep, with a specific yield of between 3 and 18 meter3/hour/man. No information is&#13;
available about wells in the coastal sector and specifically in the marine terraces. However,&#13;
the Hydro-geologic Atlas registers areas of high to medium relative hydro-geological&#13;
importance located in Regions VI and VIII. These groundwater resources are generally&#13;
found in sandy strata above sea level.&#13;
B. Agro-ecological Zones3&#13;
6.    The four principal agro-ecological zones in the Secano, three in the Coastal Secano&#13;
and one in the Inland Secano, are described below.&#13;
Zone 1: Humid Coastal Secano, Regions V to VII&#13;
7.    This agro-ecological zone occupies about 850,000 hectares on the western slope of the&#13;
Coastal Mountain Range, with 37 communities between La Ligua and Constituci6n. The&#13;
climate is marine mediterranean, with rainfall concentrated in the winter and a dry sunrmer&#13;
period,lasting 4 to 8 months. About 8 to 12 months are frost-free. Rainfall varies between&#13;
350 and 900 mm, increasing from north to south and from east to west.&#13;
2.    Chile: Irrigation Development Project, Report No. 10850-CH, Latin America and the Caribbean&#13;
Region, World Bank, October 1992.&#13;
3.    The information presented in this section is based largely on R. Novoa, Potencialidad del Secano&#13;
Costero Chileno, (Santiago: CED, 1987).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -                                Annex A&#13;
8.    Most (95%) of the area is suitable for agro-forestry. Some 57,000 hectares, with&#13;
land of Class I to IV, are suitable for irrigated crops, and 77,000 hectares of Class I to IV&#13;
are arable rainfed land. Non-arable land includes 115,000 hectares of Class VI land suitable&#13;
for pastures, and 553,000 hectares of Class VII suitable for seasonal grazing and forestry&#13;
(Table 2). Granitic and metamorphic type soils represent 45% and 24% of the area,&#13;
respectively. Both types are susceptible to erosion, which in certain municipalities affects&#13;
between 50% and 90% of their area. Micro-regions of Navidad, La Estrella and Curepto,&#13;
with typical agro-ecological characteristics for this zone, have been selected for pilot project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
9.    The area's potential is in development of livestock (goats, sheep and cattle) and&#13;
production of winter cereals and grain legumes. Intensive fruit and vegetable production is&#13;
feasible in irrigated areas.&#13;
Zone 2: Inland Secano, Regions V to VIII&#13;
10.   This zone, stretching from Llay-Llay (Region V) to the Bio Bio river (Region VIII)&#13;
on the eastern slope of the Coastal Mountain Range, has an area of 1.6 million ha. and 50&#13;
communities. Its climate is semi-arid, with irregular rainfall. Average annual rainfall varies&#13;
from 400 to 800 mm, increasing from north to south, with a dry period of 6 to 7 months.&#13;
Compared with Zone 1, relative humidity is substantially lower and evaporation is higher.&#13;
This zone is most affected by drought. The frost-free period is under 7 months.&#13;
11.   With granitic and metamorphic soils prevailing, only 7% of the land is arable,&#13;
suitable for cultivation with regular or occasional irrigation, while 12% is arable rainfed&#13;
land. In both cases, soils are Classes I to IV. Another 17% of the soils corresponds to&#13;
Class VI. Most soils (56%) are Class VII, which because of the semi-arid climate, are&#13;
suitable for grazing for short-periods and very limited forestation (Table 2). In the Inland&#13;
Secano of Regions V and VI, the protracted dry period inhibits tree growth, and plantation&#13;
establishment requires irrigation. The micro-regions of Lolol and Portezuelo are&#13;
representative of these agro-ecological conditions.&#13;
12.   The Inland Secano has potential for winter cereals and grain legume production. The&#13;
development of rainfed vineyards could be important in Regions VII and VIII. Livestock&#13;
development would be restricted to sheep and beef cattle.&#13;
Zone 3: Humid Coastal Secano, Region VII and North of Region VIII&#13;
13.   This zone occupies 680,000 hectares on the western slope of Coastal Mountain Range&#13;
between Constituci6n and the Bio Bio river, comprising 16 communities. Its climate is&#13;
marine mediterranean, with four dry months and rainfall of 400 to 1,000 mm per annum.&#13;
Average minimum and maximum temperatures are 5°C and 25°C, respectively.&#13;
14.   Easily eroded granitic and metamorphic soils prevail. The land capability&#13;
classification identifies 1.5% of arable land (Classes I to IV), with a potential for farning&#13;
under irrigation; 9% of rainfed arable land (Classes I to IV); 11 % of Class VI; and 77%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -                               Annex A&#13;
Class VII, suitable for brief periods of pasture and forestation (Table 2). The micro-regions&#13;
of Pelluhue, Trehuaco, and Coelemu are representative of this agro-ecological zone.&#13;
15.   Zonal rainfall levels permit cereal and grain legume cultivation and, in certain areas&#13;
such as Chanco, potatoes and maize. In the warmer areas, there is potential for grapevine&#13;
cultivation. Cattle and sheep are the prevailing livestock in this zone.&#13;
Zone 4: Humid Coastal Secano, South of Region VIII, and Region IX.&#13;
16.   This zone of 875,000 hectares, with 14 communities, is on the western slope of the&#13;
Coastal Mountain Range, located south of the Bio Bio river and extending to Temuco. As&#13;
this zone extends further than the agreed project limits, micro-regions representative of this&#13;
agro-ecological zone were not selected. Its climate is humid mediterranean, with at most one&#13;
dry month. Annual rainfall fluctuates between 1,200 and 2,000 mm and is more evenly&#13;
distributed than in the other zones. Average minimum and maximum temperatures are 6°C&#13;
and 21.5°C, respectively, and between 4 and 6 months are frost-free. Metamorphic soils&#13;
prevail, with some volcanic soils (trumaos and red clay). Nearly a quarter (23%) of the soils&#13;
correspond to Classes I to IV, 15% to Class VI, and 58% to Class VII (Table 2). The area's&#13;
prevailing production system is livestock-crop, combining wheat, grain legumes, beet, and&#13;
potatoes with pastures, for cattle grazing.&#13;
C. Small Farmer Production Practices in the Secano&#13;
17.   Small farmer production systems in the Secano are: (i) crops, normally alternating&#13;
grain legumes (lentils and chickpeas) with wheat, and (ii) a combination of crops (wheat and&#13;
legumes) and livestock, with a fallow rotation the first year, and wheat as the main crop in&#13;
the second year. Usually small extensions of grain legumes are cultivated. When farm size&#13;
allows, these crops are followed by three to five years of natural pastures, mainly to feed one&#13;
or two draft animals and for the production of sheep for meat and wool. In Regions VII and&#13;
VIII, wine grapes are an important crop for the small producer and, in the low and humid&#13;
parts, potatoes and beans are also planted.&#13;
18.   Land is ploughed in early spring and left fallow until the first winter rains arrive and&#13;
wheat is planted. This practice provides: (i) weed control; (ii) soil preparation for quick&#13;
sowing when the first rains appear; and (iii) theoretically, subsoil water storage. But the&#13;
practice causes erosion by (i) leaving soil without vegetative cover, exposed to the intense&#13;
force of first rains, and (ii) dispersing raindrops on the soil surface, water infiltration rate is&#13;
reduced and run-off increased.&#13;
19.   Agricultural research is needed to compare this practice with alternative tillage&#13;
methods. Such investigations should take into account: (i) chemical weed control&#13;
alternatives; (ii) vertical farming equipment and minimum tillage systems adapted to small&#13;
units, allowing quick sowing; (iii) the net effect of fallow on subsoil water retention; and (iv)&#13;
reduction in erosion losses due to delaying the fallow and keeping soil covered with&#13;
vegetation during the rainy season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -                                        Annex A&#13;
20.    Soil preparation in small farms is normally done with teams of oxen using&#13;
moldboard ploughs and tine and branch harrows. Fertilization is limited to nitrogen in wheat&#13;
cultivation. Sowing is done by broadcasting and seed is covered with branch harrows.&#13;
Broadcast sowing of grain legumes renders subsequent weed clearing with animal traction&#13;
impossible. Wheat harvest consists of manual reaping and transport, and threshing with&#13;
stationary machines. Grain legumes (lentils and chickpeas) are pulled, threshed and selected&#13;
manually.&#13;
21.    For the cultivation of potatoes and beans in the humid parts or floodplain of Regions&#13;
VII and VIII, small producers use their own seeds, generally of poor quality. Particularly in&#13;
the case of potatoes, this practice transmits viruses and other diseases. Fertilizer applications&#13;
and phytosanitary controls are minimal. Beans are harvested in the same manner as&#13;
chickpeas and lentils. Potato are harvested manually, with specially adapted animal-drawn&#13;
ploughs.&#13;
22.    For the small farmer, wine grapes are the crop with the highest profitability. But as&#13;
the vigorous and drought-resistant common stock, the "Pais", yields wine of lower&#13;
commercial value, the development potential is reduced. Vineyards, occupying limited areas&#13;
of the farms, are generally over 30 years old. The narrow space between the vines, together&#13;
with low head formation and the absence of trellises, hinders weed control and disinfections,&#13;
and makes harvesting difficult. Fertilization levels are low.&#13;
23.    Average yields obtained by large and small farmers in the Secano are presented&#13;
below.&#13;

24.    The gradual deterioration of natural pastures is related to poor management,&#13;
reflected in widespread free grazing and lack of herd size control. The seasonality of&#13;
pastures, due to climatic conditions, exacerbates the situation. Deficient herd management,&#13;
including lack of systematic sanitary control and breeding cycle regulation, results in the&#13;
concentration of delivery periods in May-June and December-January, and high abortion and&#13;
mortality rates. Finally, poor breeding selection criteria affect decreases the herd's genetic&#13;
quality.&#13;
25.    Small farmers have not participated in the region's rapid forestry expansion.  Small&#13;
farmers, denied access to the Forestry Development Law incentives, have insufficient&#13;
resources to commit to long-term forestry investments. In addition, large forestry industries&#13;
have displaced small farmers from areas with potential. Many Secano small producers sell&#13;
their lands because traditional farming is unprofitable and viable agricultural alternatives are&#13;
unavailable.&#13;
26.    While forest expansion effects soil conservation positively by protecting erosion-prone&#13;
lands, it has negative social implications as uprooted landowners are forced to migrate to&#13;
rural towns or urban centers in, the often vain, search for satisfying employment.&#13;

CHILE&#13;
SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Socio-economic Analysis of Secano Small Farmers&#13;
A. Rural Poverty&#13;
1.    Despite the strong economic performance Chile achieved in the last decade, currently,&#13;
more than 4 million people (about a third of the population) live in poverty. Although&#13;
in absolute terms most poor are in the urban areas, the incidence and severity of poverty are&#13;
greater in rural areas, (Table 1) with municipalities in Chile's Secano area having the highest&#13;
incidence of rural poverty. Sixty-five percent of Chile's poorest municipalities are in the&#13;
Secano.&#13;
Socio-Economic Characteristics of Secano Small Farmers&#13;
2.    To study the socio-economic characteristics of the Secano farming population and&#13;
define small farm survival strategy topologies, the preparation team: (i) conducted a survey&#13;
based on a simple random sample of 440 small farmer households (with a population of&#13;
2,032 individuals); (ii) investigated in detail representative cases of each farm type; and (iii)&#13;
organized male agricultural producers, female agricultural producers and young people into&#13;
separate groups to discuss alternative development strategies for their micro-region.&#13;
3.    In rural Secano municipalities, there are significantly fewer women than men. The&#13;
male/female ratio was 1. 178:1, more than 20% higher than the ratio for the Chilean&#13;
population. This is due to the migration of young women from rural to urban centers,&#13;
seeking urban employment in the service sector. The age of the adult population is&#13;
concentrated between 30 and 50 years (average age 36 years), with the household heads'&#13;
average age being 53 years. Family size ranged between 3.7 and 5.7 persons. The average&#13;
household size of 4.3 persons is greater than the national average (4.05), but approximates&#13;
the rural household average of 4.41 persons. The formal education level reached by the&#13;
population over 18 years of age was 5.12 years, well below the national rural area average&#13;
level of 6.2 years.&#13;
4.    More than 60% of the rural households surveyed live below the poverty line. Region&#13;
VII had the highest poverty incidence, with over 70% of its rural population living in&#13;
poverty. Off-farm and non-agricultural activities have become increasingly important for&#13;
supporting small farm families. For many, home consumption of farm production&#13;
supplements off-farm earnings, leaving only limited marketable surplus. Nevertheless, for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -                               Annex B&#13;
poor families, farm production for family consumption is critical to family survival. As a&#13;
result, without secure off-farm employment, many households cannot risk moving out of&#13;
agriculture. Less than 10% of the people surveyed held permanent jobs, while 8.5%&#13;
declared seasonal/occasional work.&#13;
B. Farm Size and Land Tenure&#13;
5.    Farm size in the seven selected micro-regions ranged from 0.2 ha to 72 ha, with an&#13;
average of 20.5 ha. Many farms (44%) are between 10 ha and 20 ha. Nevertheless, 10%&#13;
are below 2 ha and 31 % are below 5 ha. Precarious land tenure arrangements are prevalent,&#13;
with share-cropping being the most common. Twenty-seven percent of the farmers surveyed&#13;
were engaged in a sharecropping arrangement, either by working another's land, giving&#13;
another farmer livestock for grazing, or having sharecroppers on their farms. For many&#13;
producers, lack of formal land title seriously limits access to credit and services.&#13;
C. Secano Producer Types&#13;
6.    Farmers surveyed were classified into the following three groups:&#13;
(a)   Type I: On-farm producers, corresponds to farm units obtaining 65% or&#13;
more of their cash income from on-farm production and whose survival&#13;
strategy is based on farming. Within this group, there are three sub-groups:&#13;
(i)   crop-predominant, which draws more than half the on-farm income&#13;
from crop production;&#13;
(ii)  livestock-predominant, which draws more than half the on-farm&#13;
income from livestock production; and&#13;
(iii)   mixed type, which combines livestock, crop and other on-farm&#13;
activities, each representing less than half of on-farm income.&#13;
(b)   Type II: Transition farmers, corresponds to farmers who obtain between&#13;
65% and 35% of their cash income from on-farm production. This type&#13;
moves between on-farm and off-farm activities, depending on employment and&#13;
income prospects. This type has three sub-groups, those whose incomes are&#13;
derived primarily from: (i) crop production; (ii) livestock operations; and (iii)&#13;
wages.&#13;
(c)   Type III: Off-farm producers, includes households obtaining more than 65%&#13;
of their monetary income from off-farm sources. Three sub-types are: (i)&#13;
households in which more half the off-farm income is derived from wages; (ii)&#13;
households in which the main income sources are subsidies, transfers and&#13;
remittances; and (iii) small entrepreneurs, households in which petty commerce&#13;
and rent provide at least half the off-farm income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -                               Annex B&#13;
7.    Reflecting different agro-climatic conditions and economic survival strategies, annual&#13;
family income varied substantially among micro-regions and farm types, ranging from&#13;
Ch$960,000 (US$2,340) to Ch$3 million (US$7,500). For Type I and II producers, on-farm&#13;
income represented about 90% and 58% of the household's total cash income, respectively.&#13;
The relative importance of on-farm income declined to less than 10% of cash income for&#13;
Type III producers.&#13;
F.    Most on-farm income came from agricultural products. Wages, representing 40% of&#13;
households' off-farm income and about a fifth of monetary income, was the most important&#13;
off-farm income source. About 45% of households surveyed received wage income, with&#13;
more than 40% of these households with annual wage earnings exceeding Ch$400,000&#13;
(US$1.000). Wage were primarily related to seasonal work, between November and March,&#13;
in the fruit export sector. State transfers, such as child benefits, pensions, and&#13;
supplementary income for poor families, represented almost a third of off-farm income. The&#13;
relative importance is greatest among the poorest households, with the share of subsidies&#13;
reaching 60% or 70% of household income.&#13;
9.    The agriculturally-based strategies of the Type I and II farmers yielded similar&#13;
household, per capita income and per capita on-farm consumption levels. Type III&#13;
households, whose survival strategies are non-agriculturally oriented, had the lowest income&#13;
levels. Farm size of Type I crop-oriented producers were smaller than those of Type I&#13;
livestock-oriented farmers. Type III farms tended be the smaller than Types I and II.&#13;
Compared with Type II, Type I used land more intensively, cultivating higher-valued&#13;
products, such as orchards, vineyards and fruits as well as subsistence crops for home&#13;
consumption. Type I crop-oriented producers tended have relatively large families, to be&#13;
slightly older and closer to urban centers than other Type I producers.&#13;
10.   Type I livestock-oriented producers had a well-defined upwardly mobile development&#13;
strategy. They were likely to be engaged in sharecropping arrangements or rent land to&#13;
other producers. Cattle breeders were concentrated in Region V and sheep producers in&#13;
Region VI. Most cattle breeders tended to sell low-weight animals for further fattening, or&#13;
buy low-weight animals and sell them after reaching market weight. Sheep producers sold&#13;
off-spring every year, retaining those needed to maintain herd size. Farm infrastructure is&#13;
poor.&#13;
11.    As attractive on-farm alternatives diminish, wages have become increasingly&#13;
important to the Type II crop-oriented producer. The relatively older Type II livestock-&#13;
oriented producers lack household labor to cultivate their farm, and capital to expand and&#13;
manage properly their livestock herd. They rely increasingly on state transfers, engaged in a&#13;
continuous struggle to survive. The wage-dependent Type II sub-type, with farms on&#13;
marginal lands, uses farm production for home consumption. While about 35 % of family&#13;
labor in this group earns wages, household labor is under-utilized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -                                   Annex B&#13;
12.   Within the off-farm survival strategy Type III, there are two sub-types,' those&#13;
dependent on (i) wages (Illa); and subsidies (Illb). While reliant on non-agricultural income&#13;
sources, they also depend on agriculture to provide a crucial supplement to their meager&#13;
income.&#13;
D. Project Development Strategies&#13;
13.   The project's challenge is to address the poverty and lack of natural resource&#13;
management strategies that have progressively deteriorated the environment. Potential&#13;
beneficiaries consider that the greatest constraints to Secano development are the lack of&#13;
capital, especially for irrigation, roads and local enterprises, and limited economic&#13;
alternatives. Another constraint to growth is the poverty-induced reluctance of these small&#13;
farmers to risk experimentation with innovative production systems and unfamiliar crops.&#13;
The project would overcome this by increasing household income, effective extension&#13;
programs and risk-sharing. Effective introduction of production changes would need to (i)&#13;
clearly demonstrate results to producers; (ii) assume part of the initial investment costs and&#13;
risks; (iii) develop strong marketing links; and (iv) foster producers' organizations.&#13;
14.   Sustainable agricultural production and increased off-farm economic opportunities can&#13;
increase household incomes of each farm type. Types I and II could intensify sustainable&#13;
agricultural production, as well as increase pasture and forest lands. Type III could&#13;
substitute agricultural production with forest plantations. Extension and technical assistance&#13;
programs would promote sustainable production systems and natural resource management.&#13;
The project would generate investment to develop small agro-industries and other off-farn&#13;
employment opportunities.&#13;
15.   Type I producers would be most receptive to irrigation and crop diversification&#13;
programs. Success in crop intensification would encourage producers to make long-term&#13;
investments in forestry and improved range lands. Thus, the project would increase&#13;
economic viability of the farms. releasing non-agriculturally suited land from crops, and&#13;
gradually introducing sustainable natural resource management.&#13;
16.   Type II producers would be less inclined to adopt innovations requiring significant&#13;
changes in labor use. These relatively wage-dependent households, with few spare workers.&#13;
would alter farming practices once convinced that the income generated from the on-farm&#13;
innovation more than compensates for the associated lost wages. Provided they do not bear&#13;
full establishment costs, these producers might be inclined to develop forestry-range systems&#13;
on their marginal lands, having a preference for rangelands improvements. Based on&#13;
INDAP's experience, these producers are more inclined to adopt livestock production&#13;
improvements over crop-intensification systems.&#13;
1.    There is a third sub-type within Type III, corresponding to renters and small merchants, which is&#13;
excluded from the analysis as they are not involved in agricultural production. They could be potential&#13;
investors for micro-enterprise joint ventures, but not as primary agricultural producers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -                               Annex B&#13;
17.   Since Type III producers would be least open to innovations, the project would focus&#13;
on increasing farm production for family consumption, emphasizing commodities for which&#13;
there is a secure market for surplus production. This would require significant participation&#13;
of women, and care would be needed to ensure that the innovations do not overburden them&#13;
with additional labor.&#13;
18.    The project's very important "demonstration effect" on the late adopters will continue&#13;
after the project's conclusion. Therefore, it would be important for Mid-Term Reviews and&#13;
Evaluations to focus less on statistics (number of hectares and beneficiaries), and more on&#13;
assessing the improvements in the participating household's economic welfare.&#13;

CHILE&#13;
SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Aspects&#13;
I. Background&#13;
1.    The project's implementation institutional framework was designed based on the&#13;
following guidelines:&#13;
(a)   INDAP has been designated as Executing Agency for this project, with its&#13;
National Director responsible for project execution.&#13;
(b)   The Project Technical Unit (UTP) would provide technical, managerial and&#13;
administrative support with respect to project execution. The UTP, within the&#13;
Institute for Agricultural Development (INDAP), would manage, coordinate,&#13;
supervise, monitor and evaluate the project. As its staff would be small, much&#13;
of these activities would be performed by consultants or contracted firms.&#13;
(c)   The Project Commission (CPS) would provide guidance and make&#13;
recommendations regarding project implementation.&#13;
(d)   A project-funded municipal professional would be assigned to each&#13;
municipality to act as a liaison among project beneficiaries, the UTP, the CDL&#13;
and the municipality.&#13;
(e)   Specific mechanisms to ensure beneficiary participation in decision-making&#13;
process and implementation would be incorporated in the project design,&#13;
including, (i) an adequate representation in CDL, particularly of women and&#13;
youth; and (ii) direct involvement in the preparation of off-farm development&#13;
plans.&#13;
(f)   To avoid duplication of development efforts in the micro-regions and lead to&#13;
better coordination and complementarity, public agencies (such as MOP, CNR,&#13;
INIA, CONAF and INFOR) would participate, in their respective areas of&#13;
competence, in project activities' supervision and technical evaluation. Road&#13;
rehabilitation works, designed according to MOP standards, would be&#13;
supervised by MOP or designated consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                               Annex C&#13;
(g)   To ensure competence, as proven by the experience of other Government&#13;
programs, firms, such as NGOs, universities and consulting firms, selected&#13;
through public bidding, would implement many project activities, such as&#13;
research, technical assistance and studies.&#13;
II. PROJECT MANAGEMI\ENT&#13;
A. Project Conmmission (CSP)&#13;
2.    The Project Commission (CSP) would be chaired by the Director of INDAP and&#13;
would have as permanent members the Director of ODEPA and the government authorities&#13;
(Intendentes) of the Regions VI, VII and VIII, and with the participation, as required, of&#13;
representatives of any entity which the Director of INDAP may deem to be necessary, such&#13;
as MBN, MOP, CNR, INIA, CONAF and MIDEPLAN, for the purposes of: (a) providing&#13;
guidance in respect of the strategy for Project implementation; and (b) making&#13;
recommendations in respect of (i) POAs and corresponding budgets; (ii) rules, procedures&#13;
and operational mechanisms required for the implementation of the rational natural resource&#13;
use and sustainable agricultural development activities, and the program to finance off-farm&#13;
activities; (iii) guidelines for the studies and technical assistance under the Project; (iv) the&#13;
Project implementation, based on the evaluations of the progress of the Project and the&#13;
Project beneficiaries' participation in the execution thereof; and (v) coordination of the&#13;
Project activities with other national or regional activities related to poverty alleviation.&#13;
3.    The Minister of Agriculture (MINAGRI) would have the responsibility and authority&#13;
to reconcile differences among members of the CSP.&#13;
B. Project Technical Unit (UTP)&#13;
4.    The Project Technical Unit (UTP) would be a highly-qualified technical team&#13;
including a Unit Head, with a staff of four professionals (such as agriculturalists, agricultural&#13;
economists, civil engineers, sociologists, environmentalists), experienced in project&#13;
management, supported by an administrative staff, with a secretary. Its functions would be&#13;
the following: (i) act as liaison between the Project and the World Bank; (ii) guided by the&#13;
CSP, prepare the project implementation strategy; (iii) define POA planning and prepare&#13;
guidelines for each municipality; (iv) prepare the consolidated POA and budget, based on&#13;
POAs of participating institutions; (v) prepare procurement documents, evaluate proposals&#13;
and select implementing consultants and firms; (vi) draft contracts between project and&#13;
implementing institutions; (vii) supervise project and assist beneficiaries address&#13;
implementation issues; (viii) support and coordinate public programs in the project; (ix)&#13;
prepare and apply project monitoring and evaluation system; (x) prepare PFAP rules,&#13;
procedures and mechanisms; (xi) manage PFAP; (xii) approve PFAP-financed off-farm&#13;
investments up to US$100,000; (xiii) prepare terms of reference (TOR) for feasibility studies&#13;
for off-farm projects and provide necessary background documentation; (xiv) approve the&#13;
&#13;

Sustainable On-farm Development Programs submitted by implementing entities; (xv) with&#13;
the project-financed municipal professional, promote off-farm development projects among&#13;
potential beneficiaries; (xvi) assist municipalities, through the CDLs, to prepare and&#13;
implement PFAP-financed off-farm development projects; and (xvii) carry out any other&#13;
functions assigned by the Director of INDAP.&#13;
5.    In addition to performing the general UTP functions, each UTP staff would be&#13;
assigned to a Region, maintaining close contacts with the CDL and the project-funded&#13;
municipal professional. For the performance of many of its functions, UTP would rely on&#13;
consultants (either natural or juridical persons) and public entities.&#13;
C. Local Development Councils (CDL)&#13;
6.    Every selected municipality would have a Local Development Council (CDL) through&#13;
which beneficiaries would participate in project implementation and present their investment&#13;
proposals. In addition, the CDL would be the nexus among the project, beneficiaries,&#13;
municipalities and other entities. CDL members would define each Council's rules,&#13;
regulations and meeting schedule. The CDL would comprise the following voting members:&#13;
(i) municipal mayor or his/her representative; (ii) the INDAP area chief or his/her&#13;
representative; (iii) three beneficiary representatives, one of whom would be a woman and&#13;
another a youth representative; (iv) three representatives of farmer organizations operating&#13;
within the municipality; and (v) a representative of relevant public institutions which operate&#13;
at local level. The above would elect from among themselves the CDL head. To ensure&#13;
linkage between the CDL and project activities, the project-funded municipal professional&#13;
and the UTP would be non-voting CDL members and the professional would act as CDL&#13;
Technical Secretary. The UTP member in charge of a municipality would also be a non-&#13;
voting member of the CDL.&#13;
7.    CDL functions would be the following: (i) receive, select and prioritize off-farm&#13;
development proposals to be presented to UTP for PFAP-financing; (ii) request UTP-&#13;
financing and technical assistance for the preparation of feasibility studies for pre-selected&#13;
projects; (iii) support the UTP in preparing the annual programming of project activities,&#13;
especially off-farm activities; (iv) support the coordination of implementation activities&#13;
involving the participation of local organizations; (v) present to the UTP an assessment of&#13;
implementing entities' performance and program goals achieved in the municipality; (vi)&#13;
propose to the CSP, through the UTP: (a) activities and projects which improve the living&#13;
conditions of the rural population; and (b) general or specific rules to be modified or added&#13;
to the operational regulations of the PFAP; and (vii) prepare and approve CDL rules and&#13;
regulations, in coordination with the UTP. The CDL could invite other people, representing&#13;
relevant entities, to participate in the respective meetings, but without voting privileges.&#13;
8.    The functions of the project-funded municipal professional would be to: (i) contribute&#13;
to the preparation and implementation of project activities and municipal institutional&#13;
strengthening; (ii) orient project activities, according to approved strategy and POAs; (iii)&#13;
promote the project among potential beneficiaries and local authorities; (iv) collect and&#13;

III. PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
9.    The particular contractual terms and obligations would be specified in contracts&#13;
between the public agricultural institution and INDAP and agreed to at the signing of these&#13;
contracts. These entities would participate in project implementation through: (i) CSP&#13;
participation, with voting rights; (ii) CDL participation; (iii) direct implementation of project&#13;
components, such as INDAP, or indirect implementation, such as CONAF and the National&#13;
Commission for Irrigation (CNR), in channeling project funds;' (iv) cooperation with the&#13;
UTP in preparing TORs, public bidding, contract conditions, methodological frameworks,&#13;
and technical and administrative support in their areas of expertise; (v) cooperation with the&#13;
UTP in selecting entities to implement project activities, and supervising their work and&#13;
results, in the area of their competence; (vi) benefitting from project's institutional&#13;
strengthening component; (vii) cooperation with UTP in supervising, monitoring and&#13;
technically evaluating activities developed by contracted implementing entities, and&#13;
authorizing payments, in the areas of their competence; (viii) approval of studies,&#13;

IV. IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS&#13;
A. Financial Transfer and Assignment&#13;
10.   External and national counterpart funds would be assigned, through the Budget&#13;
Law, to INDAP.&#13;
11.   INDAP, through the UTP, would administer PFAP funds. It would maintain a&#13;
separate PFAP accounting and financial system, satisfying World Bank guidelines and&#13;
provisions of Loan Agreement between the Government of Chile and the World Bank.&#13;
1.    Implementation of part of the small irrigation works would be financed, through special bidding, by the&#13;
funding provisions contained in the Irrigation Development Law, as defined in an agreement with the&#13;
National Commission for Irrigation (CNR). The forestry activities would be agreed upon with&#13;
CONAF, under the Forestry Development Law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -                              Annex C&#13;
B. Activity Implementation&#13;
12.   Except for components whose implementation has been assigned in the Loan&#13;
Agreement to specific public or private entities, all project activities would be implemented&#13;
by well-qualified consultants (natural or juridical persons); private companies; consortia of&#13;
private entities or non-governmental organizations (NGOs).&#13;
13.   The implementing entities would be selected by competitive bidding, in accordance&#13;
with specifications specified in the Project Implementation Manual. The bids could be for&#13;
implementation of individual activities, as well as micro-regional, municipal or community&#13;
activity aggregates. Acceptable contracting modalities would be specified in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual. TOR preparation, public bidding, methodological framework,&#13;
consultant selection process and specific follow-up and evaluation activities, would be jointly&#13;
performed by UTP and the relevant public entities.&#13;
C. PFAP-Funded Activities&#13;
14.   Implementation mechanisms of PFAP-funded activities are described below:&#13;
(a)   UTP, in cooperation with the municipal and public institutions,&#13;
would: (i) inform beneficiaries of activities eligible for PFAP funding; (ii)&#13;
call for competitive bidding for implementation of certain PFAP-funded&#13;
activities; and (iii) create and maintain a consultant register.&#13;
(b)   Local Development Councils (CDL) would collect, pre-select and prioritize&#13;
requests from potential beneficiaries for off-farm investments and other PFAP-&#13;
financed activities. Investments identified as having potential would be&#13;
examined in greater depth by consultants who would formulate project&#13;
proposals. Once approved by CDL, the project proposals would be sent to&#13;
UTP. The proposal would be evaluated for its technical, environrnental,&#13;
financial, economic and social soundness by the UTP, along with external&#13;
specialists. Based on the environmental impacts assessment, project sponsors&#13;
would need to submit measures to be taken to mitigate any adverse&#13;
environmental impacts.&#13;
(c)   Three project categories would emerge from this process:&#13;
(i)  Small, simple projects of reduced costs, costing less than US$25,000,&#13;
and having obvious advantage to beneficiaries, whose sustainability or&#13;
design do not require specialized studies. The UTP would approve this&#13;
type of projects. If needed, a project could be returned to CDL for&#13;
reformulation, with UTP support.&#13;
(ii)  Large and more costly projects, ranging from US$25,000 to&#13;
US$100,000, whose possible economic, social and environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                               Annex C&#13;
impacts justify further study. Projects in this category would be&#13;
approved by the Head of the UTP, seeking advice from the Director of&#13;
INDAP, the CSP and public sector experts in the relevant disciplines,&#13;
on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
(iii) Complex projects with relatively high investment costs, more than&#13;
US$100,000, requiring feasibility studies, including social and&#13;
environmental evaluations. This category of projects would require the&#13;
approval of the Director of INDAP. Once approved, external&#13;
consultants would conduct the relevant studies.&#13;
(d)   UTP would invite firms to bid for project feasibility studies.&#13;
(e)   With support of consultants and/or relevant public entities, UTP would prepare&#13;
feasibility studies' TORs, requiring World Bank "no objection".&#13;
(f)    Once the Director of INDAP approves the UTP-prepared list ranking&#13;
companies, UTP would proceed with contractual arrangements.&#13;
(g)   UTP would receive and evaluate feasibility studies.&#13;
(h)   UTP would transmit feasibility studies' findings to CSP, CDL and&#13;
beneficiaries and  confirn potential beneficiaries' commitment to the&#13;
investment proposal.&#13;
(i)    With project assistance, beneficiaries would implement activities directly, or&#13;
indirectly, through consulting firms.&#13;
(j)    UTP, with consultants, would supervise, monitor and evaluate PFAP-financed&#13;
activities. Road rehabilitation and construction would comply with prevailing&#13;
regulations and ratification by MOP Highway Directorate approval.&#13;
(k)   Feasibility studies for irrigation works would be ratified by the relevant&#13;
regional office of MOP Irrigation Directorate. Prior to commencement of the&#13;
irrigation works, the Water Directorate of MOP would ensure the legitimacy&#13;
of corresponding water rights. UTP would hire project-financed consultants to&#13;
supervise the work.&#13;
D. Non-PFAP Funded Activities&#13;
15.   These activities correspond to technical support and assistance for on-farm actions.&#13;
With the exception of INDAP implemented short-term credit lines, non-PFAP funded&#13;
activities would be implemented by consultants, consortium of companies and NGOs,&#13;
selected by public bidding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                              Annex C&#13;
16.   The operational mechanisms of activities not financed by PFAP, detailed in the&#13;
Project Implementation Manual, are summarized below:&#13;
(a)   The UTP would invite tenders for project activity implementation,&#13;
according to the UTP-prepared specifications. Such specifications would&#13;
indicate the required tasks, role of public or private organizations and UTP,&#13;
and contract stipulations.&#13;
(b)   After the deadline for receiving proposals, proposals would be jointly&#13;
evaluated and ranked by UTP and pertinent public entities.&#13;
(c)   UTP would then prepare contracts, including technical specifications.&#13;
(d)   INDAP would provide technical-administrative support in the technology&#13;
transfer activities, especially in drafting TORs and selecting companies.&#13;
(e)   CONAF would evaluate forestation tasks by private companies. Exempting&#13;
these companies from quota payments would require CONAF's approval.&#13;
(f)   Property title clearing initiatives, involving 1979 Decree Law 2695, must be&#13;
supervised by the Ministry of National Properties (MBN). Title clearance&#13;
could be preformed by MBN or contracting consulting firms or both. UTP&#13;
would provide MBN the names, addresses and required documentation of&#13;
beneficiaries requiring title clearance.&#13;
E. Agricultural, Forestry and Agro-Forestry Research, and&#13;
Basic Technology Transfer Programs (PTTB)&#13;
17.   The following would guide the implementation of research component, including the&#13;
PTTB program:&#13;
(a)   the entire research component would be executed through a competitive award&#13;
system, implemented in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the use of&#13;
consultants;&#13;
(b)   INDAP would administer the research component and would retain the&#13;
services of a highly respected institution, with experience in financing&#13;
agricultural research, such as the Agricultural Research Fund (Fondo de&#13;
Investigaci6n Agricola, FIA), acceptable to the Bank;&#13;
(c)   the selected institution would recruit highly qualified consultants to draft letters&#13;
of invitation and terms of reference and evaluate proposals;&#13;
(d)   the entire research component would be tendered and awarded during the first&#13;
year of the project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                              Annex C&#13;
(e)   the number of individual contracts to be awarded would be based on technical&#13;
and institutional capabilities criteria, acceptable to the Bank;&#13;
(f)   the UTP, with assistance from consultants, would be responsible for&#13;
supervising, monitoring and evaluating research work and findings;&#13;
(g)   the PTTB Program (the transfer of research results to extension workers),&#13;
representing approximately 20 percent of the Research Component's budget,&#13;
would be contracted independently of the Research Program contracts. This&#13;
program, which would go beyond the project's micro-regions, would transfer&#13;
existing technology, as well as technologies adapted through the project's&#13;
Research Component; and&#13;
(h)   the following would be included in the Implementation Manual, acceptable to&#13;
the Bank: (i) a document describing the institutional arrangements for the&#13;
Research Component; and (ii) a draft agreement among INDAP, the research&#13;
institute, such as FIA, and the external consultant(s).&#13;
V. MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING&#13;
18.   A project-funded professional would be assigned to each municipality who, among&#13;
other tasks, would prepare an institutional strengthening program. This program would be&#13;
reviewed by CDL, sent to UTP and, subsequently, transmitted to CSP for analysis and to the&#13;
Director of INDAP for final approval. Once approved, an agreement would be signed&#13;
between the municipality and the project stipulating financial disbursement modalities,&#13;
activity implementation mechanisms, as well as supervision, follow up and evaluation&#13;
systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

CHILE&#13;
SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Program for Financing Poverty Alleviation Activities&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    Small producers in the Secano operate in a fragile natural environment, face&#13;
declining agricultural productivity due to resource degradation. Most are subsistence farmers&#13;
living below the poverty line. Since satisfying survival needs is so demanding, they make&#13;
investmenit decisions based on a short-term time horizon. As a result, land is cultivated&#13;
intensively, often in ways incompatible with its capabilities, resulting in greater resource&#13;
deterioration and further impoverishment of the small farmer.&#13;
2.    The development strategy of the proposed project would introduce improved natural&#13;
resource management and sustainable production systems; as well as, expand off-farm&#13;
activities providing additional income sources and boosting regional development. Special&#13;
measures, including guarantees and incentives, would be provided to reduce the risk to poor&#13;
airmers of a modifying their farming practices.&#13;
3.    The strategy's success would depend on two elements: (i) producer's acceptance of&#13;
the project proposals; and (ii) a financing mechanism responsive to beneficiaries' demands&#13;
and willing to assume a portion of the risk involved. The first element, addressed during&#13;
preparation. would be pursued further during implementation through active beneficiaries&#13;
involvement in designing and executing farm development plans and off-farm investment&#13;
proposals. The Program for Financing Poverty Alleviation Activities (PFAP) would address&#13;
(hie second element, by financing beneficiary-proposes investments.' PFAP would assume&#13;
parn of the investment risks by providing grants for some activities and co-financing the rest.&#13;
I .    The types of investment that would be financed through the PFAP are summarized below, and detailed&#13;
in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                                 Annex D&#13;
B. General Characteristics&#13;
4.    PFAP would finance on-farm activities2 promoting better natural resources&#13;
management and sustainable agricultural development, as well as off-farm activities, such as&#13;
small agro-industries, cottage industries, apiculture, mushroom processing, and handicrafts.&#13;
Only beneficiary-demanded proposals, having demonstrable economic and environmental&#13;
soundness would be considered. The municipalities, through project-financed professionals&#13;
and the UTP, would promote projects among potential beneficiaries. Professionals would&#13;
assist beneficiaries formulate proposals. Project Technical Unit (UTP), would manage&#13;
PFAP. Beneficiaries would execute PFAP-financed projects, either directly, with project&#13;
technical assistance, or by through a contracted firm or NGO. UTP, with contracted&#13;
specialists, would supervise PFAP-financed projects.&#13;
C. Investment Categories&#13;
5.    The following four PFAP investment categories are envisaged:&#13;
Natural Resource Management and Sustainable Agricultural Development&#13;
6.    This category would include investments which promote rational natural resource use&#13;
and sustainable agricultural development in selected micro-regions, such as:&#13;
(a)    Soil conservation investment: PFAP would grant finance for the purchase of&#13;
vertical tillage equipment, establishment of contour lines, stabilization of&#13;
gullies (carcavas) and terracing.&#13;
(b)    Small irrigation works: PFAP would provide financing for the construction&#13;
of small irrigation works which would not be eligible to participate in the LFR&#13;
biddings, or, due to their small size and/or unique nature, would not fit in any&#13;
LFR bidding. Moreover, during the first year of project implementation, until&#13;
the CNR would work out the necessary procedures to incorporate the Secano&#13;
irrigation works into special, tailor-made biddings of the LFR, all small&#13;
irrigation works would be financed directly through the PFAP. This would be&#13;
under financial support conditions similar to those given by FOSIS to poor&#13;
small farmers,' providing up to 90% of financing. Beneficiaries would&#13;
contribute with the remainder of the investment costs.&#13;
2.     Beneficiary groups of two or more farmers.&#13;
3.     Under this system, FOSIS provides participating banks: (i) a fixed subsidy per operation as&#13;
compensation for higher intrinsic costs of smaller loans extended in remote areas, and (ii) a guarantee&#13;
against bad investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -                                  Annex D&#13;
(c)    Improved pastures and livestock production: PFAP would finance the&#13;
establishment of pastures and fences required to implement an improved&#13;
pasture management system. Farmers would be expected to contribute 40% of&#13;
the investment cost with family labor, with the remainder provided as a grant&#13;
to the farmer. The beneficiary area limit for this finance is a maximum of 10&#13;
ha.4 The UTP would assist beneficiaries obtain credit from Livestock Banks&#13;
(Bancos Ganaderos) which would extend credit for livestock investments,&#13;
applying their terms and conditions. Based on pasture carrying capacity, the&#13;
project would set the maximum herd size to be purchased by the beneficiary.&#13;
Beneficiaries would contribute 40% of the investment costs, and would have to&#13;
repay 60% of the long-term credits.&#13;
(d)    Vineyards: PFAP would finance vineyard establishment and varietal&#13;
improvements on existing vineyards, with a 40% capital cost recovery over 10&#13;
to 15 years, including a five-year grace period, to be determined according to&#13;
the beneficiaries' capacity to repay. Maximum area per beneficiary for this&#13;
financing is three hectares..&#13;
(e)    Greenhouses: PFAP would finance small greenhouse establishment on farms&#13;
with irrigation.' Capital cost recovery is expected to be in the range of 40%-&#13;
60%, over 5 to 7 years, including two years of grace, depending on the&#13;
beneficiaries' capacity to repay.&#13;
7.     Short-term in-kind credit for project beneficiaries for farm operating costs would be&#13;
provided by INDAP. under its own terms and conditions.7&#13;
Off-Farm Poverty Alleviation Activities&#13;
8.     PFAP would finance the establishment of additional income sources, comprising&#13;
beneficiary-proposed off-farmn activities such as apiculture, small cottage industries (fruit and&#13;
vegetable preserves, mushroom drying, and handicrafts), small and medium-sized agro-&#13;
industries, including wine-making. While these would be demand-driven investments, based&#13;
on beneficiary proposals obtained during project preparation, likely investment types and&#13;
financial conditions are discussed below.&#13;
4.     This limit would be reviewed at the end of the project's second year.&#13;
5.     This limit would be reviewed at the end of project's third year.&#13;
6.     Greenhouses and/or other commercial on-farm activities would only be financed for joint ventures of&#13;
two or more beneficiaries.&#13;
7.     See Annex C "Institutional Aspects" and Working Paper I "Propuesta de Marco Institucional para la&#13;
Ejecuci6n del Proyecto de Desarrollo del Secano".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -                               Annex D&#13;
9.    Handicrafts and Cottage Industries. These would include activities such as:&#13;
handicraft centers (looms and sewing machines), legume dryers and packing plants,&#13;
mushroom dryers and packing equipment, and apiculture. While not exclusively targeted&#13;
towards women, they are expected to be the primary beneficiaries of these activities. PFAP&#13;
would finance technical and feasibility studies, including marketing studies as well as&#13;
machinery, equipment and construction of buildings to house equipment. During&#13;
construction, beneficiaries would contribute 5% to 10% of construction costs, in labor or&#13;
cash or both. Once the investment is operating, PFAP would recover from beneficiaries&#13;
another 10% to 15% of total costs, over a period to be defined in the Implementation&#13;
Manual, according to their capacity to repay. PFAP would also finance the technical&#13;
assistance required to operate and manage the proposed activities and would finance&#13;
supervision.&#13;
10.   Investment are expected to fall under two categories, those: (i) which cost under&#13;
US$25,000, benefiting a family or small group of families; and (ii) with total costs between&#13;
US$25,000 and US$100,000, benefiting larger beneficiaries groups and/or local development&#13;
associations.&#13;
Agro-industries&#13;
11.   These investments, exceeding US$100,000, would include activities such as: wine-&#13;
making, abattoirs, small sawmills and mechanical wood-processing plants. The project&#13;
would seek private investors to finance and manage these investments. PFAP would finance&#13;
feasibility studies and would provide grants up to 50% of the total investment cost. The&#13;
project would assist beneficiaries interested in participating, obtain commercial financing to&#13;
cover their contribution, an estimated 10% to 20% of the total investment, depending on&#13;
investment type and beneficiaries' economic circumstances. Private investors are expected&#13;
to contribute 30% to 50% of the total investment.&#13;
D. Procedural Issues&#13;
12.   Targeting. As the selected micro-regions are among Chile's poorest 100&#13;
municipalities, the project is highly targeted towards the poor. PFAP funds to improve&#13;
natural resources management and promote sustainable agricultural development would be&#13;
available to small producers8 of the agreed municipalities, with preference given to farmers&#13;
in the selected micro-regions. PFAP funds for off-farm activities would be available to&#13;
every member of the selected municipalities.&#13;
13.   Submission of investment proposals. Beneficiaries would present the Local&#13;
Development Council (CDL) project proposals for evaluation. If the CDL analysis indicates&#13;
8.    For the purpose of the Secano Project, small farmers will be all those that fall within the limits&#13;
established by INDAP, both in terms of farm size and capital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                                Annex D&#13;
that the investment proposal satisfies project's objectives and has development potential, the&#13;
proposal would be submitted for UTP evaluation and approval. The Director of INDAP&#13;
would have to approve investments exceeding US$100,000.9 Beneficiary contributions and&#13;
capital cost recovery levels for investment types are contained in the Project Implementation&#13;
Manual. These levels could be modified with the approval of the Director of INDAP, in&#13;
consultation with the CSP and the Bank.&#13;
14.   Feasibility studies. UTP-contracted and supervised local consultants would conduct&#13;
the necessary feasibility and technical studies. In the case of negative study findings, UTP&#13;
would return the proposal to its originators for reformulation. While, in the case of positive&#13;
results, UTP would confirm originator's interest before giving financial approval.&#13;
15.   Financing. UTP would finance firms contracted to prepare feasibility studies, as well&#13;
as prepare and execute on-farm development plans. PFAP funds for UTP approved on-farm&#13;
investments, would be channelled to beneficiaries through local INDAP offices in cash or&#13;
vouchers, exchangeable for farm inputs. Finance for rural feeder road improvements would&#13;
be provided by PFAP to participating municipalities, based on approved POAs.&#13;
16.   Beneficiary Contributions. Beneficiaries' contributions to off-farm investments&#13;
would be from their resources (especially labor) or commercial loans. To assist farmers&#13;
obtain commercial financing, the project would, to the extent possible, utilize banks&#13;
participating in the FOSIS system or other systems which are more accessible to small&#13;
farmers in remote areas.&#13;
17.   Capital Cost Recovery. Financial packages negotiated between PFAP and&#13;
beneficiaries would include capital cost recovery schemes, defined by project type. The&#13;
interest rate would be the Central Bank's long-tern paper rate (used in the Irrigation&#13;
Development Project, Ln. 3528-CH). Specifications would be included in the&#13;
Implementation Manual.&#13;
18.   Supervision. UTP would be responsible for the supervision of PFAP-financed&#13;
projects. It would contract consultants to supervise on its behalf, or, in the case of small-&#13;
irrigation works, regional MOP offices, transferring to them the responsibility for the&#13;
supervision of construction.&#13;

components and activities: (i) Natural Resource Management and Sustainable Agricultural&#13;
Development; (ii) Off-farm Poverty Alleviation; (iii) Beneficiarv Organizations; and (iv)&#13;
Institutional Strengthening.&#13;
Natural Resource Management and Sustainable Agricultural Development&#13;
2.    Consulting services would support project implementing entities to: (i) transfer&#13;
technical recommendations to small farmers; (ii) develop conservation practices adapted to&#13;
small farmers' production systems; (iii) design strategies for promoting forestry and pasture&#13;
development among small farmer communities; and (iv) assist small farmers take advantage&#13;
of marketing opportunities.&#13;
Off-Farm Poverty Alleviation&#13;
3.    This component would include off-farm activities which establish alternative income&#13;
sources for rural Secano population and promote regional economic development. The&#13;
activities would increase farm households' off-farm income, generate employment and add&#13;
value to agricultural output. Most activities would have a technical assistance component.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
4.    The project would also strengthen the capacity of municipalities to identify, formulate&#13;
and manage micro-regional projects, particularly road and marketing infrastructure. The&#13;
project would help INDAP to strengthen its small farmer program in the Secano.&#13;
Beneficiary Organizations&#13;
5.    Establishing and reinforcing beneficiary organizations would require technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;

CHILE&#13;
SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
1.     The project would improve natural resource management, emphasizing soil and&#13;
water conservation, upgrade pastures and grasslands, and reforest and enrich native&#13;
woodlands.&#13;
2.    Prior to colonization, the northern Secano was covered with espino savanna, and its&#13;
southern regions, were covered with sclerophytic vegetation and nothofagus forest. In the&#13;
early 1700s, deforestation initiated and accelerated after 1760 with wheat area expansion. By&#13;
1900, most forests from the moderately sloping areas had been removed. Two centuries of&#13;
poor resource management has deforested over 90% of the area. Even the remaining&#13;
woodland patches, on the remote steep slopes, have been degraded by extraction and&#13;
overgrazing.&#13;
3.    Soils are severely eroded, suffering structural and fertility losses. In areas with&#13;
greater rainfall, some farmland has been converted into eucalyptus and pine plantations.&#13;
Large to medium farmers cultivate the irrigated valleys. While poor farmers (the project's&#13;
beneficiary group) over-cultivate and over-graze their small plots on eroded slopes. Without&#13;
targeted efforts to improve their conditions, small farmers will be forced to continue to&#13;
deteriorate their natural resources to the point of abandonment.&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
4.    With the concurrence of the Environmental Unit (LATEN), this project has been&#13;
classified as a "B" category project for purposes of environmental assessment (EA) on the&#13;
grounds that it may be necessary to design mitigative measures for environmental protection,&#13;
particularly in the interest of avoiding: (i) threats to bio-diversity which may result from&#13;
agricultural area expansion; (ii) conflicts over water supply rights where irrigation expansion&#13;
is contemplated; and (iii) threats to human health resulting from possible air and water&#13;
contamination due to increased agro-chemical use.' Since the project would alleviate poverty&#13;
through better natural resource management, environmental improvement is an explicit&#13;
project objective, rather than an externality. The application of proper environmental&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                                Annex F&#13;
screening, evaluation and impact assessment procedures, as defined in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual, would mitigate the possibility of negative environmental impacts.&#13;
5.    Biodiversity. Since the micro-regional programs do not displace native woodland&#13;
with agriculture or plantations, there would be no threat to endangered or vulnerable flora&#13;
and fauna species,2 nor would contemplated forestry plantations or improved pastures on&#13;
degraded brush threaten fauna. Project-generated income increases would reduce pressure to&#13;
exploit fragile areas. The proposed micro-regions do not include, nor are adjacent to, the&#13;
forty CONAF identified sites within Regions V to VIII which contain significant&#13;
concentrations of endangered or rare flora species.&#13;
6.    Agro-chemicals. Increased fertilizer use is planned for crops in dryland and irrigated&#13;
rotations. In addition, expansion of specialty crops, such as, grapes, other fruits and&#13;
vegetables, would require additional pesticides and herbicides. The agricultural micro-&#13;
regional development programs comply with the Bank's Agricultural Pest Management&#13;
Guidelines. Due to limited areas of increased agro-chemical use, significant negative&#13;
impacts, through contamination of streams and aquifers, are not expected .&#13;
7.    Native woodlands. Four of the seven micro-regions contain an estimated 2,500 ha of&#13;
degraded native woodlands. The local population exploit these woodlands for fuelwood and&#13;
building materials. The project would not attempt to directly regulate this exploitation.&#13;
Instead, project forest conservation measures would be indirect, as project-related income&#13;
gains would reduce pressures to abuse the woodlands. In addition, the project proposes pilot&#13;
enrichment planting of native species in two micro-regions to test this forest management&#13;
technique.&#13;
8.    Roads. The programs for the seven micro-regions call for rural feeder road&#13;
improvement and rehabilitation. There would be no new road construction. Road&#13;
rehabilitation works would not destroy native vegetation or valuable crops. Negative&#13;
environmental impacts are expected to be insignificant, but would require M&amp;E by the UTP.&#13;
9.    Assessment. The project would improve the environment by reducing erosion and&#13;
increasing soil fertility, without threatening native flora and fauna. The project would&#13;
introduce such soil conservation measures as, contour cultivation, gully stabilization,&#13;
substitution of extractive annual crops for perennial crops or pasture, and improved soil&#13;
cover and selective fertilizer use. These measures would stabilize water flows and improve&#13;
downstream aquifer levels in the dry season. Increased income generated by the project&#13;
should reduce pressures on native flora and fauna, thus increasing their regeneration&#13;
prospects compared with the "without-project" scenario. Higher income levels could also&#13;
have positive environmental impacts through improved sanitation, health and nutrition.&#13;
Under full compliance with project procedures for sustainable agriculture, no mitigative&#13;
measures for environmental protection would be needed.&#13;

Micro-regional Programs&#13;
10.   The micro-regional programs, evaluated as independent sub-projects, have been&#13;
assigned an environmental category of "C". No special EA studies are contemplated. Given&#13;
the micro-regions' environmental deterioration, little would be gained from further&#13;
investigation of the native flora and fauna; ecology, soils (erosivity, erosion rates, fertility&#13;
decline), hydrology, or water quality. The project's "B" environmental classification is&#13;
retained in case mitigative actions, identified through M&amp;E in this project, may be required&#13;
in potential follow-up activities. Implementation of the micro-regional development&#13;
programs carries a low risk of negative environmental impacts. Compliance with proposed&#13;
procedures for agricultural production, water management, forestry and road rehabilitation&#13;
would eliminate any risk of negative impacts.&#13;
11.   Navidad. This micro-region covers 8,300 ha, over 90% of which has soils classified&#13;
VI and VII. The livelihood of half the population of 2,100 (465 farm families) depends upon&#13;
agricultural pursuits. The program calls for: improved agricultural practices with fruit&#13;
production intensification on limited areas; afforestation; improvement and expansion of&#13;
small-scale irrigation; improvement of feeder roads; and a small-scale fruit processing plant.&#13;
12.   La Estrella. This micro-region covers 9,700 ha, of which 75% has soils classed as&#13;
VI to VIII. Sixty percent of the area is severely eroded and a quarter moderately eroded.&#13;
The population is 1,800 inhabitants (196 farm families), of whom 800 live in the town of La&#13;
Estrella. The average farm family derives 60% of its income from agricultural endeavors.&#13;
The project program would call for: modification in crop rotations on arable lands and&#13;
grazing practices on soil classes VI and VII; reforestation with eucalyptus and radiata pine,&#13;
plus pilot testing and demonstration of enrichment techniques for degraded native woodlands;&#13;
soil conservation; road maintenance; construction of pilot slaughtering plant for sheep, a&#13;
tannery, and wine-making and distilling facilities. These components would be&#13;
complemented by beneficiary training and organization, clarification of land titles, and&#13;
promotion of artisan crafts and improved charcoal marketing. Environmental feasibility&#13;
studies would be conducted to ensure that these project components do not threaten the&#13;
environment.&#13;
13.   Lolol. This region covers 5,400 ha, almost 70% of which has soils classified as VI&#13;
to VII. The area has 197 farming families, which derive between 10% and 85% of their&#13;
livelihoods from agriculture. The project calls for: improved practices for annual cropping&#13;
and grazing; expansion of vineyards; development of 2,300 ha in improved pasture;&#13;
reforestation; irrigation improvement; a bean packing plant; and feeder road improvements.&#13;
14.   Curepto. The area comprises 15,400 ha, of which 95% is classified as VI and VII.&#13;
Population is 1,700 (about 435 farm families). Depending on farm type, agriculturally-&#13;
derived income ranges from 10% to 70%. The proposed program calls for reforestation of&#13;
1,400 ha; development of 400 ha of improved pasture; improved cropping and grazing&#13;
techniques; improved irrigation; a small-scale agro-processing plant; and road improvements.&#13;
During project preparation, it was determnined that the additional water demanded by&#13;
proposed irrigation investments would not prejudice supplies to downstream water users.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

15.   Chovellen. The region extends 9,800 ha, of which a small part is degraded&#13;
woodland. About 85% of the region has soils classified as VI to VIII. The population is&#13;
2,000 (about 628 farm families). About 60% of farm families' incomes is derived from&#13;
agriculture. The program calls for: irrigation development; agricultural practices&#13;
improvements (including, the elimination of wheat production); improved rural roads; minor&#13;
reforestation and improved pasture; enrichment of degraded native forest; and a mushroom&#13;
drying plant. Water supply is adequate to supply the proposed irrigation without creating&#13;
downstream conflicts.&#13;
16.   Portezuelo/Trehuaco. The micro-region covers an area of 18,600 ha. The&#13;
population is about 2.800 (around 697 farm families). Agriculture accounts for 70% of the&#13;
farm family income. The program calls for: irrigation development; establishment of 120 ha&#13;
of dryland vineyards; improvement of dryland agricultural and grazing practices; improved&#13;
rural roads and reforestation. As in the case of Curepto, the expansion of irrigation would&#13;
not have any negative environmental impact, provided design specifications and sound water&#13;
management practices are followed.&#13;
17.   Guarilihue. The area of the micro-region is 7,350 ha, of which over 95% is in soils&#13;
classified VI and VII. The population is 3,600 (about 697 farm families). About 80% of&#13;
family income is derived from agricultural activities. The program calls for irrigation&#13;
development; establishment of 250 ha of dryland vineyards; reforestation; rural roads&#13;
improvements; and improved dryland cropping and grazing practices.&#13;
Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
18.   UTP would be responsible for Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) (see Annex&#13;
C). For environmental quality, the UTP would contract experienced environmental&#13;
consulting firms. The UTP may request technical advice from specialized Government&#13;
agencies through the Executive Council (CDS) for establishing performance indicators and&#13;
terms of reference (TORs). Agencies in a position to provide such advice include the:&#13;
(a)    National Forestry Corporation (CONAF) and the Forestry Institute (INFOR)&#13;
which could assist in bio-diversity issues and defining indicators for monitoring&#13;
sustainability and performance of enrichment planting and reforestation&#13;
activities,&#13;
(b)   Directorate for Protection of Natural Resources (DIPROREN), within SAG,&#13;
which could assist monitoring water quality; and&#13;
(c)   MOP Irrigation Directorate (DR) which could advise on detection of salinity&#13;
and drainage problems in irrigation; and the National Agricultural Research&#13;
Institute (INIA) which could assist in measuring the sustainability of the&#13;
technical agricultural and grazing packages.&#13;
19.   Environmental M&amp;E would assess the sustainability and effectiveness of the technical&#13;
agricultural packages. Micro-regional adoption rates, crops and livestock yields, plantation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                              Annex F&#13;
growth rates and enrichment woodland plantings' survival rates would be routinely monitored&#13;
by the UTP. Issues related to non-adoption would be addressed.&#13;
20.   Because the possibility of negative environmental impacts is low, M&amp;E for threats to&#13;
bio-diversity or water contamination from agro-chemicals would not be required. While the&#13;
project's impact on bio-diversity could be positive, because of the degradation of the native&#13;
micro-regional flora and fauna, significant increases in rare and endangered species are not&#13;
expected. Projected agro-chemical use on limited areas, feeding into widely dispersed&#13;
streams and aquifers, having minimal flows, renders water quality measurements impractical&#13;
and unnecessary.&#13;
21.   UTP would evaluate agro-industrial plant and equipment designs to determine&#13;
discharges, absorptive capacity of reception areas, and regulations compliance. Plants with&#13;
likely damaging discharges, e.g., tanneries, would be monitored one or two years after&#13;
installation. UTP would approve infrastructure design standards and monitor compliance&#13;
during construction, subsequent operation and maintenance. In the case of rural roads, the&#13;
EAG specifications for environmental protection would be followed. Since environmental&#13;
monitoring and evaluation is built into UTP's routine operations, a special budget item for&#13;
this activity is not required.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
22.   The Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) is responsible for environmental affairs in the&#13;
project area. The Environmental System for Agriculture and Forestry Sectors within the&#13;
Agricultural Planning Office (ODEPA) is responsible for environmental planning. INIA,&#13;
INDAP, CONAF, INFOR and the Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG) through&#13;
DIPROREN handle technical aspects and implementation. MAG coordinates with the&#13;
National Commission for the Environment (CONAMA) and the Ministry of Planning&#13;
(MIDEPLAN) on environmental issues.&#13;
23.   Strong technical and managerial capability of public agencies is crucial. An Inter-&#13;
American Development Bank (IDB) loan is strengthening MIDEPLAN's investment system,&#13;
including capacity to execute environmental impact assessments (EIA) and river basin&#13;
planning. Bilateral agencies (e.g., German and US) are providing support. Under a World&#13;
Bank loan for strengthening public sector environmental management, executed by&#13;
CONAMA, provision is made for training, information systems, a native forest cadastre, and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of environmental issues in many state agencies, including those&#13;
connected with the project. Given these circumstances, additional EIA training in the public&#13;
sector would not be required under the project.&#13;
24.   UTP would be responsible for project environmental management. EIAs would be&#13;
included in the agenda of planned workshops for participating NGOs, consulting firms and&#13;
municipalities (Annex C). No additional budget nor institutional strengthening would be&#13;
required by the project in this area.&#13;

Public Awareness&#13;
25.   Project-associated environmental issues, such as biodiversity, resource contamination,&#13;
water use rights require public deliberation. For consultation purposes, an environmental&#13;
report, analyzing the project's potential environmental impacts, would circulated to national&#13;
NGOs and Local Development Councils (CDL). Based on response, the UTP could convene&#13;
meetings of interested parties. As there would be no Category B sub-projects, separate sub-&#13;
project environmental studies would not be circulated.&#13;

SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Agricultural, Natural Resource and Forestry Research&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
1.    This component would improve the generation and dissemination of crop, livestock&#13;
and forestry technologies, to support the development of the Secano area, the designated&#13;
communities and micro-regions, ultimately to improve the income and quality of life of the&#13;
Secano smallholders. Specific component objectives are to:&#13;
(a)   Improve the quality and increase the impact of dryland research and&#13;
technological transfer on production systems suited to small farmer conditions.&#13;
(b)   Develop and introduce soil conservation techniques, including appropriate&#13;
machinery and management practices to reduce soil degradation. Also,&#13;
develop and adapt methods for water catchment, harvesting and utilization and&#13;
procedures for the use of natural, non-polluting and low-cost energy sources.&#13;
(c)   Social-economic analysis of agronomic research findings concerning production&#13;
systems, including an evaluation of the impact of technological innovations and&#13;
the relationship between agricultural production and off-farm employment.&#13;
(d)   Develop and introduce alternative fruit and horticultural products as well as&#13;
genetic improvements and/or introduction of animal breeds. Increase the&#13;
technology for fodder adapted to the Secano conditions.&#13;
(e)   Develop and adapt small farmer forestry technologies for producing lumber&#13;
and wood for home consumption. Generate and introduce technologies&#13;
integrating agro-forestry systems and livestock production, along with timely&#13;
supplies of intermediate forest products.&#13;
B. Execution&#13;
2.    The project's four-year research component would be implemented through a&#13;
competitive award system. INDAP would administer the research program and would retain&#13;
the services of a highly respected institution with experience in financing agricultural&#13;
&#13;

research, such as the Agricultural Research Fund (FIA). The selected institution would&#13;
recruit highly qualified consultants to draft letters of invitation, prepare TORs and evaluate&#13;
research proposals. A short-list of about six public and private research entities, acceptable&#13;
to the Bank, would be invited to participate in each tender. The number and content of each&#13;
individual contract to be awarded would be based on well-documented technical criteria and&#13;
expected institutional capabilities of the prospective research entities. The entire research&#13;
program would be tendered and awarded during the first year of the project, in order to&#13;
ensure that research results would be available before project completion.&#13;
3.    Forestry and agro-forestry sub-components would be linked to the agricultural&#13;
research sub-component, to ensure coordination and inter-action. These could be sub-&#13;
contracted by the main tenderer to specialized entities.&#13;
4.    The Basic Technology Transfer Program (PTTB), representing about 20% of the&#13;
overall research program's budget, would be contracted independently of the research&#13;
program contracts, as these activities would go beyond the project's micro-regions. The&#13;
PTTB would transfer existing and adapted technologies through the project's research&#13;
program to areas with agro-forestry conditions similar to the selected micro-regions&#13;
throughout the Secano.&#13;
5.    Detailed institutional arrangements for the research program would be included in the&#13;
Implementation Manual. The selection of the research institute and the subsequent&#13;
contracting of consultants to prepare the TORs for tendering would be prioritized to ensure&#13;
that the respective research contracts would be awarded at the beginning of the 1996 winter&#13;
season in June, allowing research activities to commence in the 1996 spring.&#13;
6.    An important factor in evaluating the tenders would be the availability and adequacy&#13;
of research stations and required equipment.&#13;
C. Sub-Projects&#13;
Agricultural Research3&#13;
7.    The following research themes are recommended to be included in the program:&#13;
(i) adaptive research in agricultural and livestock production system technologies; and&#13;
(ii) research in soil conservation and natural resource protection.&#13;
8.    The agricultural research sub-component would provide information regarding the&#13;
interaction of crop, livestock and forestry activities needed to design small scale production&#13;
systems. In addition, fruit and horticultural species data, especially adapted to smallholder&#13;
conditions, would be generated. Finally, this sub-component would develop appropriate soil&#13;

9.    The following sub-projects are recommended to be implemented:&#13;
Sub-project 1 - Integrated livestock-crop production systems. Experiments&#13;
incorporating legumes into the Secano production systems and establishing methods&#13;
improving pasture conditions and crop rotations.&#13;
Sub-project 2 - Fruit, horticultural and viticultural alternatives. These would&#13;
include experiments to evaluate and introduce new production possibilities, especially&#13;
improved genetic materials.&#13;
Sub-project 3 - Energy use. Activities to evaluate the use of non-traditional energy&#13;
sources.&#13;
Sub-project 4 - Animal husbandry alternatives. This sub-project would introduce&#13;
animal genotypes, coarse feedstuff use, and research on sheep and goat dairy&#13;
products.&#13;
Sub-project 5 - Soil management. Activities have been defined to develop&#13;
appropriate machinery and soil management procedures, and evaluate soil fertility&#13;
losses.&#13;

define optimum establishment and management techniques for different species under&#13;
small farner conditions.&#13;
Technology Transfer&#13;
11.   Technology transfer activities would include establishing demonstration units in each&#13;
selected micro-region to be used for training of public and private extensionists working in&#13;
the Secano. As these demonstration units would cover agriculture, forestry, agro-forestry&#13;
and silvo-pasture, the units would validate alternative integrated forestry-crop-livestock&#13;
farming systems.&#13;
Sub-project 7 - Strengthening of technology transfer. These activities, based on&#13;
adoptable technologies and project research findings, would include demonstration&#13;
units and alternative farms in each micro-region. Alternative integrated crop-&#13;

SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Technology Transfer&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.    The National Institute for Agricultural Development (Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo&#13;
Agropecuario, INDAP), an autonomous public institution linked to the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, is the most important public provider of technology transfer and credit to small&#13;
farmers. INDAP's programs for eligible small farmers' and their families, are intended to&#13;
improve their productivity and family income, their living conditions and integration into the&#13;
national economy. INDAP extension programs are organized within agro-climatic zones with&#13;
rural municipalities displaying similar socio-productive characteristics.&#13;
2.    INDAP assists two kinds of small farmers: (i) those with sufficient resources and&#13;
capital, and/or technical capacity to increase their productivity and integrate into the national&#13;
economy in the short-terrn; and (ii) those with farms of 5 HRB (see footnote no. 1) or less,&#13;
having limited potential to increase family well-being. The relative importance of the latter&#13;
group to INDAP's program has increased from 53% in 1990 to about 75% in 1994. In&#13;
1988/89, INDAP, through its Technology Transfer Program (PTT), adopted a two-pronged&#13;
approach, which served the better-off clientele through the Integrated Technology Transfer&#13;
Program (PTTI), while placing greater emphasis on the poorer farmers through the Basic&#13;
Technology Transfer Program (PTTB). The World Bank's Small Farmer Services Project&#13;
(Ln. 3473-CH), which became effective in 1992, supports INDAP's assistance to farmers&#13;
with 5 or fewer HRB.&#13;
3.    PTT is executed by private consulting firms contracted directly by beneficiary farmers&#13;
and paid with INDAP subsidized voucher/coupons (bonos). A consultant can earn up to a&#13;
limited number of bonos and the bono's face value varies regionally. Participating firms,&#13;
included in a national registry of consultants, are selected through competitive bidding.&#13;
1.    Under INDAP criteria, small farmers have: (i) a farm of less than 12 HRB equivalent; (ii) total assets&#13;
of less than US$84,000; and (iii) agriculture as their main income source, irrespective of land tenure&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
* A basic irrigated hectare, or hectdrea de riego busico (HRB), is equivalent to one hectare of Class I&#13;
irrigated land in the fertile Maipo River Valley near Santiago.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                                Annex H&#13;
4.    Despite its extensive and successful experience in innovative extension mechanisms,&#13;
INDAP's presence in the Secano has had limited impact. Its efforts have been seriously&#13;
hampered by the (i) dearth of viable small farmer strategies suited to the Secano's precarious&#13;
economic and ecological conditions; and (ii) poorly qualified or/and weakly motivated staff&#13;
contracted to carry out the INDAP's program. INDAP's recently developed Strategic Plan,&#13;
acknowledges these limitations and identifies a series of actions, many consistent with the&#13;
Secano Project, to improve its performance.&#13;
B. Technology Transfer Program&#13;
5.    INDAP would be responsible for the project's technology transfer component and&#13;
would be expected to strengthen its presence and impact in the Secano. By testing and&#13;
generating alternative small farmer development strategies, the project would assist INDAP&#13;
deliver effective technology packages adapted to the Secano. The project would ensure that&#13;
the professional field staff is properly qualified and motivated by approving field&#13;
appointments and providing incentive payments and scholarship programs.&#13;
6.    The technology transfer and technical assistance program would include the following:&#13;
(i) On-farm Activities, for small farner agricultural units; (ii) Natural Resource Conservation&#13;
and Management, interventions on participating farms to introduce resource management and&#13;
conservation of micro-catchments and watersheds; (iii) Technology Transfer Teams, in each&#13;
micro-region, INDAP technical teams would execute the technological transfer and technical&#13;
assistance activities; and (iv) Farm Development Plans, assistance to beneficiaries in the&#13;
design of sustainable farmn development plans to be financed through the PFAP.&#13;
Beneficiaries&#13;
7.    Program beneficiaries would be small farmers, women, young people and municipal&#13;
organizations of the selected micro-regions interested in participating in the project's&#13;
activities. Applying INDAP's definition, a small farmer, for project purposes, would be a&#13;
producer whose farm is under the equivalent of 12 HRB, and whose assets do not exceed&#13;
3,500 UF (US$104,000)2.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
8.    The transfer programs would include individual field visits, meetings, technical talks,&#13;
demonstration farms, technical trips and field days. Group activities would be favored.&#13;
Audiovisual and logistic support elements would be used. The program would include a&#13;
minimum of three annual visits to beneficiaries' farms and the establishment of at least one&#13;
2.    To expand project coverage to those farmers whose share of off-farm income relative to total income is&#13;
significant, a third INDAP criteria requiring that agriculture be the beneficiary's main income source&#13;
would not be applied in the Secano project.&#13;

demonstration farm in each micro-region, selected and developed in agreement with the&#13;
research entities selected to conduct the respective research programs (see Annex G).&#13;
9.    Actions to be undertaken at the farm level would be agreed upon between the&#13;
beneficiary and the team and written in a two-year renewable agreement, signed by both&#13;
parties, with an annex containing (a) a description and schedule of the actions to be&#13;
undertaken, and (b) delineation of the signatories' responsibilities.&#13;
Technology Transfer Teams&#13;
10.   The professional field staff would be (a) experienced in agriculture, and, if possible,&#13;
in agri-business; (b) familiar with transfer methods and communications; and (c) familiar&#13;
with the Secano rural culture. The teams would be composed of generalists, supported by&#13;
veterinary, pasture management, irrigation and forestry specialists.&#13;
11.   The teams would: (i) prepare, together with the beneficiaries, farm development&#13;
plans; (ii) promote natural resource conservation; (iii) propose beneficiary technical&#13;
assistance and training; (iv) prepare, follow-up and process applications for credit and/or&#13;
subsidies for on-farm development; (v) promote beneficiary organizations, when needed; (vi)&#13;
maintain a close relationship with INIA, INFOR and other institutions engaged in forestry&#13;
and agricultural research; (vii) identify, with beneficiaries, potential off-farm projects; and&#13;
(viii) participate in local training programs.&#13;
Implementing Arrangements&#13;
12.   INDAP would contract firms, NGO and others, through competitive bids, based on&#13;
agreed terms and conditions, to form the field teams. The project would approve each&#13;
professional participating in the field. Contracts with firms and others would have a two-&#13;
year duration, automatically renewable for a similar period with a positive performance&#13;
evaluation. An incentive system, to encourage sustained efforts to reach specific goals,&#13;
would be designed and incorporated in the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
13.   Prior to their field work, the teams would participate in a mandatory three-day&#13;
seminar. In addition, the teams would be invited to participate in a one-week seminar&#13;
regarding: (i) their assigned micro-region, including its social-economic characteristics;&#13;
(ii) on-farm and off-farm projects; (iii) small farmer extension methodologies; (iv) relevant&#13;
work by other institutions in the micro-region; (v) institutional coordination; and&#13;
(vi) relationships with among public entities.&#13;
14.   The team would be supervised by INDAP and the Project Technical Unit (UTP). The&#13;
team's performance would be evaluated at the end of each agricultural year. For this&#13;
purpose and to measure the project's impact at farm level, 5 percent of participating farms,&#13;
would be randomly selected and studied. Project activities on these farms would be analyzed&#13;
and compared with the agreement signed by the farmer and its annex, outlining the annual&#13;
program and projected goals. Two or three additional farms, identified by the evaluators,&#13;
would also be assessed. The evaluation would cover off-farm projects, training programs,&#13;
&#13;

16.    The field team's composition and size depend upon the (a) size of the micro-region,&#13;
(b) projected participation, and (c) complexity of activities to be developed. The team would&#13;
generally comprise an agriculturist and one or more agricultural technicians, with periodic&#13;
visits of specialists.&#13;
17.    Taking into account the professional and technical staff in each micro-region, the&#13;
estimated program costs for four years amount to US$2.3 million equivalent.&#13;

Rural Roads&#13;
A. National Road Network&#13;
1.    The Directorate of Roads (Direcci6n de Vialidad) of the Ministry of Public Works&#13;
(MOP) is responsible for road construction and maintenance. The country's road network&#13;
includes registered roads (caminos enrolados) and non-registered (caminos no enrolados).&#13;
Non-registered roads are private roads converted to public use under the Agrarian Reform&#13;
and/or tracks constructed by smallholders or rural municipalities. Lacking proper&#13;
maintenance, these are generally in poor condition.&#13;
2.    Registered roads include: (i) national, main or basic roads; and (ii) primary and&#13;
secondary municipal roads. Main roads, which link regions and provinces, are legally&#13;
recognized through a public decree (decreto supremo). Primary municipal roads link&#13;
municipalities and secondary municipal roads or the rural feeder roads running within a given&#13;
municipality.&#13;
3.    There are 23,300 kilometers of main roads, 24,500 kilometers of primary municipal,&#13;
and 31,500 kilometers of secondary municipal roads. About 5% of the national road&#13;
network is concrete, 10% has asphalt pavements and the rest is graveled or earth.&#13;

4.    In the past, the MOP Directorate of Roads has given priority to main or basic roads&#13;
over primary municipal roads, and, due to budget constraints, neglected the secondary&#13;
municipal roads. Increases in secondary municipal road budgets from $Ch6,000 million in&#13;
1992 to $Chl2,000 million in 1993 are insufficient and these roads continue to be in&#13;
generally poor condition.&#13;

B. Roads within the Micro-Regions&#13;
6.    The seven participating micro-regions have 408 km of registered and 171 km of non-&#13;
registered roads. Maintenance is poor. Improper surfacing, combined with clay soil and&#13;
flooding, make roads impassable in the rainy season, isolating many villages for extended&#13;
periods. Consulting firms retained for the preparation of the Secano Project concluded that&#13;
the proposed micro-regional development programs would require the rehabilitation of 270&#13;
km of registered roads and 105 km of non-registered roads.&#13;

C. Rural Road Compoiient&#13;
7.    The objective of the project's rural road component is to ensure year-round access to&#13;
the selected micro-regions and their municipalities to avoid agricultural product losses,&#13;
reduce transport costs and ease marketing, as well as permit continuous access for technical&#13;
and social services. Registered roads would be rehabilitated on a priority basis by the MOP&#13;
Directorate of Roads and financed through normal budgetary allocations. The project would&#13;
rehabilitate and improve non-registered roads, particularly to the up-grading of dry weather&#13;
roads to all-weather standards.&#13;
8.    Based on project consultants preliminary selection of non-registered roads to be&#13;
improved under the project, the project would rehabilitate or improve 105 km of non-&#13;
registered rural feeder roads. Improvement work would include: (a) construction of culverts,&#13;
bridges, side ditches, drains and other similar structures; (b) gravel surfacing; and (c)&#13;
protection against flood damage. Cost estimates are based on MOP work quantities per km&#13;
and standard unit prices. Detailed studies and designs would be completed during project&#13;
execution. Rehabilitation works would be in accordance with MOP standards, which are&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. Construction would be carried out by specialized local contractors&#13;

about 90 percent of the estimated investment requirement and would not cover O&amp;M costs,&#13;
an estimated US$0.65 million. The implementation of the road rehabilitation program would&#13;
be complemented by works undertaken by MOP, within its budget. Cost estimates and&#13;

SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Land Titling&#13;
A. Background&#13;
General&#13;
11.   Despite Government efforts to address the issue during the 1980s, lack of land titles is&#13;
widespread among small farmers in Chile, particularly in the Secano. Most tenancy&#13;
problems arise from undivided inheritance and de facto land possession.' By the end of&#13;
1990, 108,000 rural tiles and 64,000 urban titles had been regularized by the Ministry of&#13;
National Property (Ministerio de Bienes Nacionales, MBN) and 72,000 titles by INDAP on&#13;
indigenous lands. However, it is estimated that 130,000 non-indigenous and 6,000&#13;
indigenous rural families remain without proper land titles. Although informal arrangements&#13;
are effective, these are not legally binding and limit small farmers' access to services and&#13;
benefits, such as: (i) the forestry subsidies under the Forestry Development Program; (ii)&#13;
irrigation water rights and subsidies for small irrigation works; (iii) subsidized housing&#13;
construction under Ministry of Housing programs; and (iv) private lending institutions.&#13;
12.   MBN is responsible for developing, conducting and enforcing the governmental policy&#13;
on issues related to the: (i) acquisition and control of public properties; (ii) maintenance of&#13;
an updated register of public goods; (iii) layout of specific development policies for fiscal&#13;
lands; and (iv) regularization and consolidation of small agricultural property.&#13;
13.   The MBN has a Bank-financed program, the Small Farmers Services Project (Loan&#13;
3473-CH), to expand its normal land titling activities and regularize 43,500 new titles over a&#13;
four-year period, which began 1992.' However, the land titling program has fallen behind&#13;
schedule, as indicated by recent figures issued by MBN3 (Table 1). The titling program thus&#13;
far has concentrated on irrigated area and producers along main trunk roads, effectively&#13;
excluding the Secano small farmers from the program.&#13;
I.    C. D. Scott (1990), "Land Reform and Property Rights among Small Farmers in Chile", in D. E.&#13;
Hojman (1990), Neo-Liberal Agriculture in Rural Chile, (London: Macmillan).&#13;
2.    See World Bank, CHILE: Small Farner Services Project, SAR Report No. 10133-CH, (August 7,&#13;
1992)&#13;
3.    With the exception of the Metropolitan Region, all the cases not completed either during 1992 or 1993&#13;
are still active and they should be finished by the end of 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -                                    Annex J&#13;
14.   Several factors contributed to the program's poor performance. First, beneficiary&#13;
identification is cumbersome and highly centralized. With INDAP and the municipalities,&#13;
each MBN regional office draws up a list of potential beneficiaries among program&#13;
applicants. Ignorance of the program or improper documentation exclude many otherwise&#13;
eligible beneficiaries from this list. Based on these lists, the central MBN Land Titling Unit&#13;
determines regional land titling packages and allocates program resources among the various&#13;
regions.&#13;
15.    Secondly, public competitive bidding for selecting MBN contracted firms to perform&#13;
regularization work is time consuming.4 Thirdly, consulting firms tend to choose to work&#13;
with the more easily accessible farmers, those near towns and along roads. Also, the&#13;
performance of the contracted firms has been uneven, and some contracts have been&#13;
terminated due to failure to satisfy agreed procedures and goals. Another major cause of the&#13;
program's backlog is that the "easy" titles were done in the 1980s, and remaining cases are&#13;
more difficult, more complex or in remote areas.&#13;
16.   Finally, registration into the Property Roll (Conservador de Bienes Raices) of the&#13;
MBN endorsed titles, requiring more than five months, is a severe bottleneck to a speedy&#13;
land titling process.'&#13;
17.    According to MBN officials, the transfer of the selection of consulting firms to the&#13;
MBN Regional Offices (SEREMIS) has resolved some problems. Also, with experience the&#13;
process is becoming more streamlined and less time-consuming. However, the beneficiary&#13;
identification remains a serious bottleneck, and the MBN Regional staff is insufficient to&#13;
process the backlog of land titling dossiers. A Mid-Termn Review in May 1994 suggested&#13;
that MBN hire consultant supervisors for six months to deal with the backlog, divide large&#13;
titling packages into smaller units, and include more firms in its Contractors Register.&#13;
B. Land Titling in the Secano&#13;
18.    About 50%  of the small farmers in the selected micro-regions have land titling&#13;
problems (Table 2).6 Tenancy problems are concentrated among poorer small farners. In&#13;
the selected micro-regions, more than half the farmers with land titling problems are "off-&#13;
farm oriented producers" (Type 1II), which tend to be the poorest farners; 29% are "on-farm&#13;
producers" (Type I); and 19% are "transition fartners" (Type II) (See Annex B). Since the&#13;
project's forestry program depends upon the forestry subsidy scheme, lack of land titles&#13;
4.     Under DL 2695, which provides for the regularization of small rural properties, there are two&#13;
regularization procedures: i) the state directly executes the field and legal work required to grant the&#13;
individual titles or; iij contracted firms or individuals perform the work, under the supervision of&#13;
MBN. MBN reviews the contracted work and grants the titles.&#13;
5.     While, by law, the Conservador de Bienes Raices must process a dossier in 30 days, this procedure&#13;
normally takes much longer.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -                                     Annex J&#13;
could seriously limit this component's execution. On the other hand, tenancy problems&#13;
among "on-farm producers" could constrain expanded on-farm investment in irrigation,&#13;
intensified cropping patterns, improved pastures, and expanded silvo-pastoral development.&#13;
C. Land Titling of Project Beneficiaries&#13;
Objectives&#13;
19.    The project's land titling component would regularize the property rights and give&#13;
land title to of potential beneficiaries with unclear land rights. The land titling component is&#13;
expected to resolve property rights problems of 85%  of the potential beneficiaries or 1,190&#13;
potential beneficiaries (about 14,000 Ha.) in the selected micro-regions by the end of the first&#13;
year.7 Table 3 quantifies the goals expected for the component in each micro-region.&#13;
According to MBN's timetable, land titling process requires less than 12 months (see&#13;
timetable below). However, given the difficulties that are likely to be encountered because&#13;
of the dispersion of farmers in the Secano, the project's objective would be to complete the&#13;
land title regularization during the project's second year.&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
20.    The project would establish an agreement with INDAP and MBN to give priority to&#13;
1,190 Secano project beneficiaries for the 1996/97 regularization program of the Small&#13;
Farmer Services Project (Loan 3473-CH). Under this agreement, the UTP would identify&#13;
and screen beneficiaries at the micro-regional level. INDAP would give priority to the&#13;
cases on the UTP list to be submitted to MBN during 1995/96. MBN would contract,&#13;
through public bid, and supervise firms to complete the cases, ensuring that Secano Project&#13;
beneficiaries would be regularized before the beginning of the project's second year.&#13;
21.    Three months after project start-up, with the assistance of the participating&#13;
municipalities and local support professionals, the UTP would deliver INDAP a list of&#13;
potential beneficiaries. Cases would be selected based on the: (i) needs of the potential&#13;
beneficiary; (ii) potential beneficiary's willingness to participate in other project activities;&#13;
and (iii) probability of a quick resolution to the case.8 INDAP would include these Secano&#13;
cases in the list it submits to MBN each year. If necessary, micro-regional cases would be&#13;
7.     For planning purposes, it is assumed that 90% of the potential beneficiaries will be interested in&#13;
participating in the regularization program. This rate is above the participation rate expected for other&#13;
project components (70%) since most producers will have an interest in regularizing their land titles,&#13;
even though they may not consider participation in other project activities. Although this could be seen&#13;
as an unnecessary cost. it should also be understood as an incentive for the incorporation of farmers&#13;
into other project activities. Also, based on information provided by consulting firms regarding drop-&#13;
outs, it is estimated that 5% of the cases would not be completed due to unresolvable problems between&#13;
heirs and/or legal claims.&#13;
8.     A screening of the cases, searching for disqualifying causes, could save significant resources and time.&#13;
There are various causes that can be easily detected (see DL 2695). The MBN will provide a guide to&#13;
do the screening of the potential beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                                 Annex J&#13;
grouped into regional packages to make them more manageable for the consulting firms and&#13;
MBN supervision.&#13;
22.   The MBN would contract firms from a its registry to perform the land titling process.&#13;
The MBN would pay the consulting firms's honoraria and ensure that the contractual&#13;
arrangements are consistent with DL 2695 and Handbook of Technical Procedures. The&#13;
MBN would coordinate its activities with the UTP and supervise the firms&#13;
23.   Once legal and technical requirements have been satisfied, the MBN would approve&#13;
the land titling request and request inscription of the title in the corresponding Property&#13;
Rolls. Estimated time to complete land titling procedures for Secano project area is less than&#13;
one year (see Table 4). MBN would ensure timely progress by: (i) overseeing that the&#13;
selection of the consulting firms by the SEREMIS is completed on schedule; (ii) providing&#13;
resources for field procedures; and (iii) certifying the fully processed land titles.&#13;
Benefits&#13;
24.   This component would ensure that most small farmers in the project area would have&#13;
land titles. Secure land titles would expedite water rights claims and access to state benefits.&#13;
Additionally, small farmers would be in a better position to access commercial financial&#13;
sources. With secure tenure, the small farmers would be more likely to increase on-farm&#13;
investment and, therefore, not only improve their economic situation, but also increase the&#13;
market value of their land. Regularized land titles would promote an open land market.&#13;
Granting land titles would encourage sustainable natural resource management strategies as&#13;
small farmers with clear property rights would be keener to adopt conservation practices.&#13;
Risks&#13;
25.   Granting land titles would stimulate the development of the land market at the micro-&#13;
regional level which could threaten the small farm family. Although this is a necessary step&#13;
toward the consolidation of small properties into sustainable family farms, it may also&#13;
concentrate land into large corporate farms (mostly forest industries), threatening the survival&#13;
of viable, sustainable, family farms. There is also the risk that some farmers, upon&#13;
receiving land titles, may not participate in other project components. However, an&#13;
agreement between the potential beneficiaries and the UTP whereby the beneficiaries commit&#13;
their participation in other project component, particularly the forestry and silvo-pastoral&#13;
activities would mitigate this risk.&#13;
26.   Continued fragmentation of properties after land titles have been granted poses a&#13;
serious risk. Without measures ensuring minimum farm size, granting land titles does not&#13;
deter further fragmentation of small farms among heirs. In the Secano, the harsh economic&#13;
conditions and the deteriorated state of its natural resources require a minimum farm size for&#13;
the development of sustainable production systems and natural resource management&#13;
strategies.&#13;

The total cost of this consultancy is estimated to be US$100,000&#13;
III. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING FOR NATURAL RESOURCE&#13;
MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION&#13;
15.   The study, carried out by a consulting firm, in consultation with the Ministry, would&#13;
analyze the natural renewable resource (NRR) situation and a NRR management system of&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI). The consultancy would:&#13;
(a)   Define the institutional framework responsible for the NRR, i.e., soil, water,&#13;
flora (including forests) and fauna. Prepare a strategy and program, including&#13;
legal aspects, to establish the proposed framework.&#13;
(b)   Identify and propose NRR management instruments.&#13;
(c)   Design programs to strengthen NRR programs of concerned agencies.&#13;
16.   The consultancy would define the institutional framework in MINAGRI to orient and&#13;
administer NRR management and conservation. The study would analyze alternative&#13;
institutional arrangements.&#13;
17.   The proposed institutional framework would have the following functions:&#13;
(a)   maintain the monitoring systems with the purpose of having updated&#13;
information on the state and condition of the NRR;&#13;
(b)   propose and maintain policies at the central level, with regional development&#13;
for NRR conservation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                               Annex K&#13;
(c)   permanent evaluation of the impact on resource conservation of programs and&#13;
policies of a productive character, suggesting the corresponding adjustments;&#13;
(d)   maintain close links with production-related agencies and institutions, public&#13;
and private.&#13;
(e)   promote and coordinate research in NRR;&#13;
(f)   provide training and technology transfer of sustainable use of soil to&#13;
institutions, extension workers and farmers.&#13;
18.   The study would propose a strategy and program to establish the institutional&#13;
framework. The strategy would take into consideration the current institutional framework's&#13;
deficiencies as well as the complexity of the tasks, such as legal changes, program&#13;
restructuring or strengthening. When pertinent, legal modifications or drafts should be&#13;
19.   A review of instruments regulating NRR management and conservation is needed to&#13;
recommend modifications and new instruments which can provide the proposed institutional&#13;
framework the capacities to carry out its functions.&#13;
20.   The study would:&#13;
(a)   Review the present legislation and determine which aspects connected with the&#13;
NRR are properly covered by the laws and regulations in force and identify&#13;
which ones are not.&#13;
(b)   Establish deficiencies in terms of laws, regulations and rules, in order to cover&#13;
those aspects related to the NRR which are not oriented or controlled by the&#13;
present rules or by existing initiatives in public agencies (e.g., CONAMA).&#13;
(c)    Evaluate the existing instruments in terms of the NRR conservation, and&#13;
propose those considered necessary to cover the deficiencies.&#13;
21.   The study would determine for each MINAGRI institution or technical agency which&#13;
aspects require modification or strengthening to fulfill their NRR responsibilities. Human,&#13;
financial, infrastructure and equipment resources would be evaluated. Programs to overcome&#13;
their deficiencies would be proposed.&#13;
22.   The study would begin during the first year of project implementation and would&#13;
require 6 months. UTP would prepare the study's terms of reference. The study must be&#13;
performed by a consulting firm with experience in this work in Latin America and a legal&#13;
team familiar with Chilean legislation and institutional framework.&#13;
23.   The estimated cost of this consultancy is US$150,000.&#13;

Supervision Plan&#13;
Schedule&#13;
1.    A project launch workshop would be held to consolidate collaboration of public and&#13;
private entities at the national, regional and municipal levels required for successful project&#13;
execution. Representatives of Ministries and agricultural entities, regional and community&#13;
authorities, representatives of beneficiaries' associations, and NGOs would participate. This&#13;
workshop would be held immediately after Board approval. Subsequently, two supervision&#13;
missions would take place each year. The first, held in March/April, would focus on the&#13;
implementation progress of the previous year's POA, as described in the annual progress&#13;
report, submitted to the Bank by March 31. The second mission, held in August/September,&#13;
would review the proposed annual budget and work plan, included in the draft POA,&#13;
submitted to the Bank two weeks prior to mission departure. Both missions would include&#13;
field visits to project micro-regions, together with meetings with beneficiaries, community&#13;
mayors, regional officials and others.&#13;
2.    During the first year, supervision would cover organization, team development and&#13;
operational issues (i.e., procurement, disbursement and auditing procedures) with a view&#13;
toward strengthening the UTP. Bank supervision missions would assist in the selection of&#13;
implementing entities, helping to ensure the project's technical, financial, social, and&#13;
environmental soundness.&#13;
3.    The tentative supervision timetable and proposed Bank staff (supported by local&#13;
consultants) requirements are as follows:&#13;
Mission No. 1&#13;
Project Launch Workshop&#13;
January 1996.&#13;
4.    This mission would review the planned budget and implementation schedule for 1996&#13;
and focus on policy, regulations, administration, procurement, disbursements and auditing&#13;
procedures. In addition the mission would examine UTP, its establishment, functions,&#13;
including specific responsibilities (with detailed job descriptions) and clear rules of&#13;
communication. Particular attention would be paid to the establishment of the monitoring&#13;
and evaluation (M&amp;E) unit, whose role in a pilot project is critical to continuously monitor&#13;

would comprise the Task Manager, a natural resource management specialist, an&#13;

required. Total 4-8 SW.&#13;
Mission No. 2&#13;

agreed POA and performance indicators), especially with regard to institutional&#13;
arrangements, contracting for micro-regional programs, research activities and other&#13;
implementation issues. Mission participants would be the Task Manager and two to three of&#13;
the above specialists, as required. Total 3-6 SW.&#13;
Mission No. 3&#13;
Second Annual Budget and POA Review&#13;
August-September 1996.&#13;
6.    This mission would focus on budget and proposed POA review for 1997, paying&#13;
particular attention to important implementation issues. The mission would consist of the&#13;
Task Manager and one to two specialists, as required. Total 2-4 SW.&#13;
Mission No. 4&#13;
First Annual Progress Evaluation&#13;
March-April 1997&#13;
7.    This mission would analyze project performance during 1996 (compared with the&#13;
agreed POA and performance indicators). It would consist of the Task Manager, and one or&#13;
two specialists, as required. Total 2-4 SW.&#13;
Subsequent Supervision Missions&#13;
1997-2000&#13;
8.    Subsequent supervision missions would follow the pattern set by missions No. 3 and&#13;
4, respectively, except mission No. 5, scheduled for March-April 1998, which would&#13;
coincide with the project's Mid-Term Review.&#13;
9.    The estimated supervision input envisaged for the five year project implementation&#13;
period would be 25-50 staff weeks in the field. In addition, about 12 staff weeks would be&#13;
required annually for review and approval of project documents, implementation, follow-up&#13;
and correspondence. Supervision effort would be greatest during the first year and gradually&#13;
decrease as implementation became routine. To increase efficiency and contain supervision&#13;
cost, the continuity of the preparation team and task manager is essential.&#13;

Annual and Mid-Tern Reviews&#13;
10.   Beginning in 1997, annual reviews would take place in March-April and in 1988,&#13;
would coincide with the Mid-Term Review. Both would analyze project components (i.e.&#13;
Natural Resource Management and Agricultural Development, Poverty Alleviation Fund, and&#13;
Technical Assistance) against implementation and impact indicators (Annex L), as well as&#13;
assess project achievements. Both reviews would evaluate the dialogue with beneficiaries,&#13;
financial support, and coordination with the Director of INDAP and the CSP. Based on the&#13;
qualitative assessment of beneficiary participation, the Reviews would recommend any&#13;
needed implementation adjustments.&#13;

CHILE&#13;
SECANO RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
A. Benefits and Costs from Natural Resource Management and&#13;
Sustainable Agricultural Development and Rural Infrastructure Components&#13;
1.    The project would improve the production patterns of more than 22,000 ha of 1,345&#13;
small farmers (out of 2,845 within the seven selected micro-regions; see para. 13) and&#13;
develop sustainable small farmer production systems consistent with land capabilities. Area&#13;
under annual crops would be reduced by at least 3,400 ha, concentrated on better soils and&#13;
diversified into higher-value crops. The wheat area is conservatively estimated to decline&#13;
from 2,750 ha to about 930 ha. Once new production systems are fully developed and&#13;
farmers no longer rely on their on-farm production for subsistence, wheat production in the&#13;
project area would likely disappear. Project-financed irrigation works on 1,500 ha would&#13;
increase cropping intensities. On 5,000 non-irrigable ha, the project would introduce rainfed&#13;
cultivation practices aimed at proper soil and water conservation.&#13;
2.    Additionally, the project would increase area under grapes, the Secano's most&#13;
profitable crop, to about 2,100 ha, improve vineyard cultivation practices to avoid soil&#13;
erosion and introduce grape varieties with higher market value. Land released from crop&#13;
cultivation would be directed to pastures and forestry. At pilot project completion, it is&#13;
expected that there would be over 6,100 ha of properly-managed natural pastures, 3,570 ha&#13;
of improved pastures, 3,400 ha of silvo-pastoral production, 4,500. ha of planted forest and&#13;
100 ha of woodland renovation.&#13;
3.    By promoting commodities for which there is strong domestic and export demand, the&#13;
project would integrate a relatively marginal region into the main economy. The project area&#13;
is expected to produce annually over US$2.6 million of vegetables and pulses for domestic&#13;
markets. In addition, US$3.0 million of wine and nearly US$1.0 million of lamb would be&#13;
produced, an important share of which would be exported. Additionally, project-promoted&#13;
forestry activities would produce US$36.0 million of roundwood or posts for local fruit&#13;
industry, and US$27.0 million of pulpwood for the pulp industry, throughout the project's&#13;
life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -                                Annex 0&#13;
B. Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR)&#13;
4.    Natural resources and rural infrastructure components. The internal economic rate of&#13;
return for these components is 20.7%. Working hypotheses of likely beneficiary choices&#13;
were developed to estimate the internal economic rate of return of the project's natural&#13;
resource management and sustainable agricultural and rural infrastructure components.&#13;
5.    This estimate incorporates the costs of on-farm investments (US$13.0 million),&#13;
technology transfer (US$2.0 million), rural infrastructure (US$2.4 million) and the Project&#13;
Technical Unit (US$1.1 million). The IERR includes economic benefits derived from: (i)&#13;
crop productivity gains, resulting from improved practices; (ii) crop diversification into&#13;
higher-valued crops; (iii) decreased production costs; and (iv) reduced marketing margins,&#13;
due to better rural infrastructure were taken into account and applied to indicative farm&#13;
models, representative of project beneficiaries in the Secano.' This estimate is conservative,&#13;
since it does not consider the benefits accruing from reduced soil run-off and erosion.&#13;
Furthermore, the analysis did not capture "without project" productivity loses (as a project&#13;
benefit) due to declining soil fertility.&#13;
6.    Off-farm investment component: As beneficiaries would determine which activities&#13;
would be financed, an ex-anzte estimation of costs and benefits of the off-farm investment&#13;
component can be made by analyzing a sample of likely off-farm projects. The preparation&#13;
team found that most proposals would be small, ranging between US$25,000 and&#13;
US$100,000, and economically highly feasible, having estimated internal economic rates of&#13;
return above 25%. Since only technically and economically sound proposals would receive&#13;
project finance, this component would likely increase the project's internal economic rate of&#13;
return. To ensure economic viability, a threshold of a minimum estimated internal economic&#13;
rate of return would be applied as a selection criteria to sub-project proposals.&#13;
7.    Technical assistance, institutional strengthening and training components: Technical&#13;
assistance would help beneficiaries execute off-farm poverty alleviation activities and support&#13;
Government decentralization efforts through institutional strengthening. The economic&#13;
impact of these interventions was not evaluated as the portfolio of off-farm investments&#13;
would be defined at implementation by the beneficiaries and the benefits arising from&#13;
facilitating rural municipalities in the execution of their responsibilities, as well as&#13;
beneficiary training, are not quantifiable.&#13;
8.    Research and studies components: These components' benefits would stem from: (i)&#13;
research for increasing the economic development of the Secano, given its special social and&#13;
ecological circumstances; (ii) an improved Governrment natural resource management&#13;
monitoring system; and (iii) an analysis of local commodity markets. Preliminary estimates&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -                               Annex 0&#13;
by preparation team indicate that the IERR would be positive. However, the benefits of&#13;
these investments would be available after the pilot project has completed and would benefit&#13;
project beneficiaries, as well as Secano farmers, in general. Therefore, because of the&#13;
externalities inherent to investments of this nature, the economic rates of return for these&#13;
components were not calculated.&#13;
C. Economic and Financial Considerations&#13;
9.    The internal economic rate of return used base costs plus physical contingencies, less&#13;
taxes and price contingencies. The opportunity cost of capital was 12%.&#13;
10.   Pricing. The rate of exchange of the Chilean peso is determined in the open market.&#13;
As there are no major trade restrictions, domestic prices tend to correspond to border&#13;
economic values. For the economic analysis, the criteria and assumptions used by the&#13;
Ministry of Planning (MIDEPLAN) were applied. Border prices were used for all tradeables&#13;
produced by the project, based on the projections of MIDEPLAN and exporting firms&#13;
(which, for wheat and maize, are lower than Bank projections). A conversion factor of 0.90&#13;
was used for inputs and machinery.&#13;
11.   Labor. While the project would increase on-farm and off-farm employment in the&#13;
selected micro-regions, unemployment and under-employment would not be eliminated.&#13;
Therefore, MIDEPLAN's labor cost assumptions were used, including unskilled and semi-&#13;
skilled labor shadow prices, estimated at 0.66 of the market wage rate. The market rate for&#13;
skilled labor was assumed to reflect its opportunity cost.&#13;
12.   Yields. In the without-project situation, yields were assumed to remain constant,&#13;
although there are indications that, as a result of declining soil fertility, yields have been&#13;
declining.&#13;
13.   Adoption Rates. During the first year of implementation, project participation of&#13;
between 5% and 10% of the small farmers in the selected micro-regions is expected.&#13;
Participation would increase in subsequent years, until the project year five, when an&#13;
estimated 47 percent of small farmers in the selected micro-region would participate in the&#13;
project. Relatively high participation rates are expected due to the: (i) farmers' interest&#13;
expressed in the participatory diagnosis carried out during project preparation; (ii) attractive&#13;
incentive packages offered; (iii) relatively low risk the production packages represent to&#13;
farmers' subsistence; and (iv) high probability of successful implementation due to system-&#13;
oriented technical assistance. Moreover, the project's flexibility in implementation would&#13;
allow for design adjustments to address constraints to farmers' adoption.&#13;
14.   Farmers' Income. The project is expected to more than double family on-farm&#13;
income. Nevertheless, given their impoverishment, even with these on -farm income gains,&#13;
a significant proportion of the families would continue to live in poverty. Farmners with off-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117-                                   Annex 0&#13;
farm oriented survival strategies would benefit least from increases in on-farm earnings. But&#13;
these farmers' incomes would increase through project-financed off-farm activities.&#13;
15.   Inappropriate cultivation practices, combined with soil fertility losses and low natural&#13;
pasture yields, depress Secano most on-farm income below the "extreme poverty line".&#13;
According to MIDEPLAN, the annual per capita "poverty line" income is US$723 and the&#13;
"extreme poverty line" income is US$362.2 Applying these benchmarks,3 most farmers in&#13;
the project area have on-farm incomes substantially below the "extreme poverty line". Only&#13;
small farmers (i) with farms larger than 20 ha4 (less than 25% of the total) and/or (ii)&#13;
engaged in vineyard and intensive horticulture cultivation have higher on-farm incomes. In&#13;
the absence of remedial action, the generally low on-farm Secano incomes would decline&#13;
further due to the deterioration of the region's natural resources.&#13;
16.   Applying indicative farm models' to assess the project's impact, farms with vineyards&#13;
would obtain the highest income levels, about twice the poverty level. Farms, combining&#13;
agricultural (with 0.5-0.8 ha under irrigation) and livestock production, are likely to earn an&#13;
on-farm income ranging between the poverty line to twice the poverty line. On-farm income&#13;
of farms, combining agro-livestock production with silvo-pastoral activities, would&#13;
approximate the poverty line.&#13;
17.   On-farm income earnings for farms in areas with highly degraded natural resources&#13;
would be derived primarily from forestry, reserving agricultural production for home&#13;
consumption. Although the project would increase on-farn incomes, the level would remain&#13;
below the "extreme poverty line". Therefore, the project would increase these farmers'&#13;
incomes through the PFAP-financed off-farm investments. Additionally, the project would&#13;
generate annual employment for 1,000 wage laborers in agriculture, livestock and forestry.&#13;
D. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
18.   The IERR of 20.7%  was based on a sample of project-promoted on-farm actions&#13;
which farmers could implement, as well as improvements in rural infrastructure. This&#13;
includes the costs of short-run relatively low-return activities, essential to the improved&#13;
natural resource management and sustainable agricultural production system. While the&#13;

3.    Ideally, one should have region-specific poverty line estimates but, in their absence, the national&#13;
average figures were assumed to be a good approximation.&#13;
4.     Assuming they have the capital required to fully exploit their farms, which is not always the case.&#13;

            Chile - Secano Rural Poverty Alleviation
            and Natural Resource Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The project will address rural poverty
            and natural resource degradation, mutually reinforcing
            problems, through the development and validation of
            comprehensive strategies which achieve sustainable rural
            poverty and economic growth through increased family income
            and improved natural resource management. The Secano's
            diverse and fragile resource base, along with a lack of
            effective regional poverty alleviation strategies, argues
            for a project which can validate alternative development
            approaches. The heterogeneity of Secano conditions call for
            a micro-regional approach starting with pilot-scale
            sub-projects in representative areas to test the
            technological, social and institutional actions considered
            to be most likely to succeed. The project will develop
            viable strategies which will: a) improve natural resource
            management to reverse soil degradation and establish
            sustainable production systems; and b) expand off-farm
            economic activities and improve economic infrastructure to
            diversify income sources and boost regional development. The
            results of the micro-regional endeavors will serve as
            economically viable and environmentally sound models for
            possible eventual larger government-funded programs,
            covering a greater area of Secano. Project components will
            be: a) natural resource management and sustainable
            development; b) off-farm poverty alleviation; c) support
            services; d) technical assistance; e) land title
            regularization; and f) studies.
