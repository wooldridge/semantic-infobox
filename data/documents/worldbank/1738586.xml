Program-South Asia (WSP-SA) is&#13;
carrying out into private sector&#13;
participation and the poor in the       E&#13;
urban water sector. Proposals to _&#13;
involve the private sector in water&#13;
supply and sanitation sometimes&#13;
raise fears that the poor will be&#13;
priced out through higher tariffs&#13;
and costly connection fees or&#13;
overlooked because they live in&#13;
hard-to-reach locations. The&#13;
reality is that the private sector&#13;
has the capacity and the interest&#13;
to serve the poor, is willing to&#13;
experiment with low-cost options&#13;
and different levels of service,&#13;
and with greater efficiency, can&#13;
benefit all consumers. There are&#13;
examples of this in other parts of  a   "-=   1&#13;

BOX 7: ELECTRICITY COMMITTEES IN ORISSA&#13;
In July 1997, the Grid Corporation of the Indian state of Orissa offered majority participation in its entire&#13;
distribution business to private investors. Two private firms took over the four distribution zones. At that time,&#13;
about 40% of power was not being paid for; about half of this was due to technical losses, and the other half&#13;
was being stolen, or not being paid for even if it was correctly metered and billed.&#13;
Badapandusar village had 287 connections, of whichl32 were illegal connections which overloaded the&#13;
transformer, and burnt it out. The supply became so irregular that even consumers with legal connections&#13;
were reluctant to pay. The linesman did not read the meters regularly, the bills were often wrongly prepared&#13;
or, due to poor postal services, were delivered long after they were due. Poorer consumers could not afford&#13;
to pay the large amounts in infrequently and irregularly presented bills. For the private sector operator,&#13;
Gridco, now a cost-conscious entity, revenue from the village was insufficient to justify repairing the trans-&#13;
former again and again, let alone upgrading it. Things were at a crisis stage, and the solution lay in using a&#13;
local NGO as an intermediary to mobilize the community.&#13;
The company assured the villagers that supply would quickly improve if everyone got legally connected, and&#13;
if they paid their bills regularly. The NGO was asked to set up an electricity committee, and the company&#13;
offered to pay it the fee it paid private bill collectors. The committee employed three young men to do meter&#13;
reading, bill distribution and minor electricity repairs. The committee started organizing monthly bill pay-&#13;
ment meetings, where billing and technical problems were also discussed and sorted out with company staff.&#13;
132 illegal connections were converted into official ones, and 73 more households connected. Revenue&#13;
more than doubled. Not only were current bills being paid regularly, the committee worked out repayment&#13;
schedules for arrears. The company could now afford to add a new transformer and repair the old one, and&#13;
supply improved dramatically (Ghate: 2000).&#13;

            cities - private sector participation in water and sanitation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper is part of a research, and
            dissemination initiative which the Water and Sanitation
            Program - South Asia is carrying out into private sector
            participation and the poor in the urban water sector. It
            looks at practical interventions which can be made in the
            design of major private sector participation transactions,
            assuming that the market is attractive, and operators are
            prepared to bid for work in the sector. The intention is to
            provide governments with information which will enable them
            to ensure that such transactions benefit poor consumers, at
            least as much as they benefit the rich. And, the objective
            of this paper is to state some hypotheses regarding the
            issue of private sector participation and the poor, based on
            what is admittedly limited experience, but to propose some
            approaches which could be used in the preparation of new
            transactions in South Asia. Finally, it is implied that
            commitment to capacity building for effective regulation,
            and for monitoring performance evaluation is needed, but,
            that the benefits that the private sector can bring, will
            not be realized unless water, and sanitation service
            provision, and regulation are separated from the business of governing.
