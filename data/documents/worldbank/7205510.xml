A. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
1. ProjectRationale&#13;
&#13;
Late 2005 saw the culmination o f the political transformation established for Afghanistan&#13;
by the Bonnagreement in2001,forming the basis for the state-building and development&#13;
ina country emerging fromnearlythree decadesofconflict andpolitical turmoil.&#13;
&#13;
Despite unmet expectations for some o f the population, Afghanistan's progress in some&#13;
sectors has been impressive - development o f road networks had reduced travel times&#13;
and improved rural access; school enrolments have reached historic highs; health&#13;
facilities are gaining outreach; thousands o f rural communities have been mobilized for&#13;
development; commercial banks have opened up for business andmicrofinance programs&#13;
have extended services to thousands, predominantly women. Real GDP, excluding opium&#13;
production, i s projectedto grow by 14 percent in2005/06 (SY 1384), following increases&#13;
o f 29 percent in 2002/03, 16 percent in 2003/04 and 8 percent in 2004/05. However, the&#13;
situation i s far from normalized and the country has not fully emerged from its state o f&#13;
conflict. For every success, there remain formidable, numerous challenges.&#13;
&#13;
These challenges are particularly demanding in rural Afghanistan, which i s home to&#13;
nearly 80 percent o f the population, and where incidence o f rural poverty is high,&#13;
penetration o f insurgency growing, and opium production booming as the country&#13;
recovers from the long-term effects o f the recently ended six-year drought.&#13;
&#13;
To address state building, local governance, warlordism, and to urgently provide basic&#13;
rural infrastructure for irrigation, drinking water, electrification, rural roads and school&#13;
the government has promoted since 2003 a massive effort to outreach rural communities&#13;
through the National Solidarity Program (NSP). The NSP, supported by the International&#13;
Development Association (IDA) and several donors, has been progressing successfully in&#13;
the last three years quickly positioning itself as the government's most tangible&#13;
intervention in rural areas, significantly contributing to the process o f pacification,&#13;
democratization andreconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
Executedby the Ministry o f Rural Rehabilitation andDevelopment (MRRD)on behalf o f&#13;
the Government o f Afghanistan, the NSP first commenced as a component o f the&#13;
Emergency Community Empowerment &amp; Public Works Project inJune 2002 (HOO9-AF,&#13;
closed in Dec 31, 2004). It became a full fledged National Priority Program in 2003&#13;
under Afghanistan's National Development Framework and over the last three years has&#13;
grown to become the government's flagship rural development program, with its outreach&#13;
extending to more than half the rural population across all 34 provinces o f the country&#13;
(Map 1).&#13;
&#13;
Known inDari as Hambastagi Milli and inPashtu as Milli Paiwastoon, the NSP targets&#13;
the needs o frural communities through a community-driven approach and a collaborative&#13;
partnership encompassing central andprovincial government, local and international non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGOs), andthe communities themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implemented by the MRRD through an extensive network o f contracted Facilitating&#13;
Partners (FPs), the NSP: (i)    Facilitates a process o f establishing inclusive, voluntary&#13;
community institutions (Community Development Councils, CDCs) through democratic&#13;
elections, reaching consensus on development priorities, developing eligible investment&#13;
proposals, and implementing community projects; (ii)Provides direct Block Grant&#13;
transfers to a bank account established inthe name o f the CDCs to support rehabilitation&#13;
and development activities planned and implemented by the elected CDCs; (iii)          Builds&#13;
capacity to enhance the competence of members o f CDCs (men and women) interms o f&#13;
financial management, procurement, technical skills, and transparency; and (iv) Links&#13;
local institutions to government administration and aid agencies with available services&#13;
andresources.&#13;
&#13;
The NSP is very popular in Afghanistan. The program i s widely recognized as the main&#13;
instrument for strengthening local governance and supporting the planning and&#13;
implementation o f community-based subprojects that invariably generate labor for the&#13;
poor, stimulate local economies, andprovide basic rural infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
2. Government Strategy&#13;
&#13;
The NSP i s the main instrument o f the Government for restoring and reconstructing the&#13;
village social and economic infrastructure. It will be a key vehicle in the delivery o f the&#13;
benchmarks for the L A N D S Agriculture andRural Development pillar, particularly inthe&#13;
areas o f rural infrastructure and community development.         NSP community projects&#13;
cover nearly all the areas o f priority investments for rural infrastructure: drinking water,&#13;
sanitation, small-scale irrigation, roads and structures, schools andvillage electrification.&#13;
&#13;
Article 140 o f the Constitution o f Afghanistan stipulates that `In order to organize&#13;
activities involving people and provide them with the opportunity to actively participate&#13;
inthe local administration, councils are setup indistricts andvillages inaccordance with&#13;
the provisions o f the law. Members o f these councils are elected by the local people&#13;
through, free, general, secret anddirect elections for a period of three years.'&#13;
&#13;
Along with the impelling need to rebuild and rehabilitate basic rural infrastructure, the&#13;
government strategy i s therefore to establish the CDC as the democratically recognized,&#13;
development body at the community level inthe whole of Afghanistan. Toward this end,&#13;
the MRRD is committed to creating a CDC constitution to provide legal status to the&#13;
CDCs inthe future. As a first step toward this goal, MRRDhas made substantial progress&#13;
in drafting a CDC by-law. The draft CDC by-law recognizes the CDCs as the lowest&#13;
form o f local governance, institutionalized at the village level, in line with the&#13;
Constitution. It also recognizes the CDC as the interface between the government and&#13;
the communities for the decision making, planning and implementation o f all rural&#13;
development inventions o f the other government ministries and agencies. The CDC by-&#13;
law i s expected to be submitted to the President for approval after review by the National&#13;
Steering Committee in the forthcoming months. This will take the country one step&#13;
further to realizing their Constitution and to consolidate the democratization process&#13;
which began in2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Official recognition and future CDC legislation would enable CDCs to have a legal&#13;
footing to harness resources from other relevant government ministries, development&#13;
actors, and aid agencies. Additionally, the MRRD recognizes that the role o f the CDC&#13;
must be strengthened through coordination with different line ministries as the entry-&#13;
point for development interventions targeting communities (health, infrastructure,&#13;
education, natural resource management) and through linkages with the existing sub-&#13;
national administrations.&#13;
&#13;
For the purpose o f the proposed IDA Grant, the government has developed a seven year&#13;
vision which includes the initial phase o f three years to reach out to all rural&#13;
communities, so that every rural village is represented by a CDC, and the final phase o f&#13;
four years to consolidate assistance to the communities within an exit strategy that sees&#13;
the termination o f the NSP as a program, andthe empowerment o f the CDCs as officially&#13;
recognized, local development entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B. BANKRESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
1. TheNSPandthe I-ANDs&#13;
&#13;
NSP is making a significant contribution towards achieving the vision and goals o f the&#13;
Government o f Afghanistan set out in the interim-Afghanistan National Development&#13;
Strategy (I-ANDs) which will lay out the basis for an Afghanistan Poverty Reduction&#13;
Strategy. The NSP is directly in line with the overall vision for the Islamic Republic o f&#13;
Afghanistan, `to consolidate peace and stability through just, democratic processes and&#13;
institutions, and to reduce poverty and achieve prosperity through broad based and&#13;
equitable economic growth'.    The NSP objectives and achievements to date are in line&#13;
with overall poverty reduction objective o fthe Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Since its inception, the NSP has covered 274 districts in all 34 provinces o f Afghanistan.&#13;
As o f September 2006, 17,278 communities have been contracted to Facilitating Partners&#13;
(FPs) with 14,820 communities mobilized and 14,120 Community Development&#13;
Councils elected representing an estimated thirteen million people. About 9,3 15 CDCs&#13;
had received block grants to fund 17,026 subprojects.          A total o f 7,455 priority&#13;
subprojects had been completed with 10,113 subproject proposals approved and currently&#13;
being implemented by the communities themselves. A further 2,741 subprojects have&#13;
been approved and are waiting for their first block grant disbursement to begin&#13;
implementation. A total o f US$246.1 million has been committed to fimd approved&#13;
subprojects o f which US$ 200.9 million has been disbursed directly to communities.&#13;
IDAhas financed $138 millionto NSP to date.&#13;
&#13;
Returns on NSP outputs are immediate, and the evidence suggests that their benefits to&#13;
villagers are high. A sample o f subprojects selected for economic analysis showed&#13;
economic rates o f return (ERR) averaging 26.3 to 60.8 percent, with an overall ERR&#13;
weighted average o f 38.2 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Communities have consistently prioritized infrastructure projects for their block grants&#13;
and on average implement two subprojects with their allocations. More than halfo f the&#13;
community projects involve productive infrastructure such as irrigation, roads and village&#13;
electrification thereby promoting productivity and stimulating local economies. A further&#13;
26 percent involves safe water and sanitation which assures better health for the&#13;
communities. More than 80 percent o f all labor generated by the subprojects is absorbed&#13;
within the communities, with 16.6 million labor days already created, giving the poor&#13;
income generating opportunities. Community implemented subprojects have also proven&#13;
to be the most cost-effective delivery mechanism for rural infrastructure, often costing 50&#13;
percent or less thanthe alternative options on the market.&#13;
&#13;
3. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
InMay 2006, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors discussed a new Interim&#13;
Strategy Note (ISN) for Afghanistan, which guides the Bank`s engagement for the next&#13;
two years, and is aligned with the government's InterimNational Development Strategy&#13;
(I-ANDs). The ISNenvisages a grant program o f up to US$540 million over those two&#13;
years, which i s inline with the World Bank's five-year pledge o f US$1.2 billion made at&#13;
the January 2006 London Conference. Under the ISN, the World Bank priorities are: (i)&#13;
buildingthe capacity and accountability of the state, (ii) improving rural livelihoods and&#13;
promoting rural economy, and (iii)supporting the growth o f a formal, modern, and&#13;
competitive private sector. Because o f its design and outreach, the NSP i s considered one&#13;
o fthe key instrumentsto achieve these objectives.&#13;
&#13;
Financing for the NSP i s mainly through IDA grants, the JSDF special window for&#13;
Afghanistan, donors co-financing through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund&#13;
(ARTF), andthrough direct bilateral arrangements (table 1).&#13;

&#13;
Inaddition to the above, NSP also received bilateral funding from Denmark (US$ 9.0&#13;
million) andNorway (US$1.6 million), most ofwhich have beendisbursed.&#13;
&#13;
Funds currently available for the NSP are expected to be entirely disbursed by end o f&#13;
December 2006. A new IDA Grant, as a repeater project, i s therefore needed to scale-up&#13;
the NSP as a well performing, highly visible national program. The Government&#13;
requested the Bank to provide financial support for this repeater operation at World&#13;
Bank's annual meetings heldinSep 2006,&#13;

the foundations for strengthening o f community level governance, and to support&#13;
community-managed subprojects comprising reconstruction and development that&#13;
improve access o f rural communities to social and productive infrastructure and&#13;
services".&#13;
&#13;
Reaching out to an estimated additional 4,318 new villages, the NSP will (i)     establish a&#13;
framework for village level consultative decision making and representative local&#13;
leadership as a basis for interaction within and between communities on the one hand,&#13;
and with the administration and aid agencies on the other, (ii)      implement social and&#13;
economic productive activities addressing the basic village needs, and (iii)develop&#13;
humancapitalandlivelihoodwhich will improve householdwelfare.&#13;
&#13;
The government o f Afghanistan envisions the roll-out the program across the entire&#13;
country inthe next three years or phase I1o f the NSP for a total cost o f US$525 million&#13;
which includes a back-log o f US$ 90 million from the current phase. This amount i s&#13;
expected to be financed through IDA, ARTF, JSDF andbilateral resources.&#13;
&#13;
2. ProjectComponents&#13;
&#13;
The Grant will finance about 23 percent o f the total projected cost o fthe National&#13;
Solidarity Program inthe next three years and for the following components:&#13;
&#13;
(i)Block Grants for communities (US$94.3 million) to carry out subprojects&#13;
      involving reconstruction and development           activities through a facilitated&#13;
      participatory planning process. This will cover about a third o f the amount&#13;
      estimated to complete block grant disbursement to existing and new communities&#13;
      (US$288 million) for the whole program. While the use o f block grants i s demand-&#13;
      driven following each Community Development Plan priorities, based on the&#13;
      experience gained in the program to date it i s expected that block grants will be&#13;
      invested mainly on community-based productive and social infrastructure such as&#13;
      irrigation works, roads including culverts and small bridges, erosion protection,&#13;
      structures promoting watershed management, water supply facilities, micro-&#13;
      hydropower, school buildings etc.&#13;
&#13;
(ii)Community Facilitation and Subproject Preparation (US$9.7 million) to&#13;
      support local communities through: (i)   facilitation exercises to establish inclusive&#13;
      community institutions (CDCs),       and identify local development needs and&#13;
      priorities; and (ii)&#13;
                         assistance for preparing subproject proposals. Inthe NSP I1the&#13;
      FP cycle o f support to CDCs has been reduced from three to two years. This&#13;
      timeframe will still allow the FPs to support communities with mobilization and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      establishing o f CDCs, community planningand implementation o f block grants for&#13;
      community projects while substantially decreasing facilitation costs.&#13;
&#13;
(iii)CDCCapacityDevelopment(US$14.4 million) to assistCDCsincarryingout&#13;
      subprojects for which block grants have been made available, and capacity building&#13;
      for members o f local communities. These services will strengthen local&#13;
      communities' capacity infinancial management, procurement, and technical skills.&#13;
&#13;
(iv)  Implementation and Management Support (US$1.5                   million) comprising&#13;
      provision o f consultants' services for capacity building in, implementation support&#13;
      to, and incremental operating costs for the MRRD. The project will also augment&#13;
      theMRRD's human andphysical capacity to supervise andimplement the project.&#13;
&#13;
At the end o f the three years, it is expected that the NSP will have reached out to 21,600&#13;
communities (target figure i s 90 percent o f the estimated total o f 24,000 villages across&#13;
the country, accounting for inaccessible areas due to security reasons), established a&#13;
corresponding number o f representative bodies to lead community development planning&#13;
and financing in their areas per the CDC by-laws, and made available basic social and&#13;
productive infrastructure and other services in75 percent o f the communities.&#13;
&#13;
3. ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
The project description reflects the operational policies described in detail in the NSP&#13;
OperationalManual (OM), which are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
Approach: The NSP provides a single-window framework for village level reconstruction&#13;
and development activities. It consists o f four core elements: (i)      Facilitation at the&#13;
community level to assist communities establish inclusive community institutions&#13;
through secret ballot and democratic elections; reach consensus on priorities and&#13;
corresponding subproject activities; develop eligible sub-proposals that comply with NSP&#13;
appraisal criteria; and implement approved project sub-proposals; (ii)   A system o f direct&#13;
block grant transfers to support rehabilitation or development activities (subprojects)&#13;
planned and implementedbythe elected CDCs; (iii)        Capacitybuildingthe capacities of&#13;
CDC and community members (men andwomen) inparticipation, consensus building,&#13;
financial management and accounting, procurement and contract management, operations&#13;
and maintenance, and monitoring; and (iv) Activities linking CDCs to government&#13;
agencies,NGOsand donorsto improve accessto services andresources.&#13;
&#13;
Coverage: Each year MRRD develops a NSP roll-out plan that identifies target districts&#13;
and establishes the total number o f communities within each district to be mobilized.&#13;
Districts are selected based on vulnerability factors (level o f poverty and risk o f drought&#13;
or food insecurity), the number o f returnees or internally displaced persons, and security&#13;
conditions.&#13;
&#13;
Community Development Councils: Communities are identified on the basis o f existing&#13;
local settlement and social patterns. However, this will not prevent different distinct&#13;
villages, whether small or large, from joining together to develop assets (e.g. a school, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
pipe water system, or a road) that serve more than one village. The CDC is responsible&#13;
for: (i)Overseeing preparation o f the Community Development Plan (CDP) with&#13;
prioritized needs and subproject activities that address these needs; (ii)Convening&#13;
community wide meetings to ensure community participation during all phases; (iii)&#13;
Overseeing planning and preparation o f specific subprojects either directly or through&#13;
community project management committees; (iv) Mobilizing community contributions;&#13;
(v) Presenting subproject plans for appraisal; (vi) Managing and supervising subproject&#13;
implementation with assistance from the Facilitating Partner agency; (vii) Overseeing (or&#13;
directly handling) procurement and financial management at the community level; and&#13;
(viii) Reporting to the community andto MFNDonproject progress anduse o f funds.&#13;
&#13;
Elections:   The CDC is established through an election conducted according to the&#13;
following rules: (i) Everybody inthe community (both men and women) who i s entitled&#13;
to vote ingovernment elections is eligible to be registeredas a voter; (ii) Eachpersonhas&#13;
one vote; (iii)The voting will be conducted through a secret ballot; (iv) Candidates and&#13;
electioneering is prohibited; (v) At least 60 percent o f eligible voters have to vote for an&#13;
election to be valid; (vi) The FP must verify the accuracy o f the cast ballots on a sample&#13;
basis; and (vii) Only one CDC is elected per community. After the election, the CDCs&#13;
are registeredwith MRRD.&#13;
&#13;
To ensure inclusiveness interms o f different socio-economic, factional, and ethndtribal&#13;
(qaum) sub-divisions within the community, the electionprocess i s based on a division o f&#13;
the community into groups o f families (clusters). Each cluster elects two representatives&#13;
for the CDC: one male and one female. Since neighbors are usually also relatives, this&#13;
approach will reduce purdah restrictions on women and thereby facilitate their active&#13;
involvement in discussions and the election. Cluster sizes will vary depending on the&#13;
size o f the community, but should not exceed about 20 families. The clusters will also&#13;
serve as the framework for community-wide consultations, whereby elected members&#13;
meet with and seek feedback from their electorate before making decisions on priorities,&#13;
subprojects, and community contributions.&#13;
&#13;
Experience from NSP Iindicates that equity can be achieved even in extremely&#13;
conservative communities if the basic equity principles are presented early in the&#13;
mobilization process and time is taken to work with community leaders to identify ways&#13;
in which the principles can be honored without compromising cultural and religious&#13;
norms.&#13;
&#13;
InNSP I1there are no longer separatemale or female CDCs. Communities may choose&#13;
to establish Men's and Women's Sub-Committees where it is not possible for men and&#13;
women to meet together for cultural and/or religious reasons. Insuch cases, four officers&#13;
for each sub-committee are elected and an Executive Coordination Committee is&#13;
established, comprising two officers from each Sub-committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Block grant allocations to villages are based on the following three principles: (i)     One&#13;
block grant (budget) will be allocated to each CDC at a rate o f US$200 per family with&#13;
an upper limit o f US$60,000 per community.             This allocation requires that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
community develops one or more eligible subproject proposals within the framework o f&#13;
the block grant allocation and its own contributions; (ii)                One CDC will be established&#13;
for each community. CDCs cannot be established for sub-sets o f an existing village (e.g.,&#13;
a village can not be split into its constituent political or ethnickinship (qaum) sub-&#13;
divisions); and (iii) community is a village o f more than 25 families.&#13;
                            A                                                                      However,&#13;
clusters o f adjoining communities may opt and are encouraged to pool up their block&#13;
grant entitlements and allocations to plan and implement subprojects o f common interest&#13;
andbenefit to them.&#13;
&#13;
Eligibility: Inorder to be eligible for ablock grant allocation, a community must develop&#13;
one or more subproject proposals that fulfill the following criteria: (i)                    Subproject is&#13;
proposed by a CDC that has been elected in accordance with the NSP guidelines; (ii)&#13;
Subproject is endorsed by the community through a community-wide consultative&#13;
process; (iii) Subproject provides equitable access to benefits; (iv) At least one subproject&#13;
identified by women as a priority must be targeted for NSP funding; (v) Subproject is&#13;
technically and financially sound (uses the engineering specifications in the Technical&#13;
Manual, where appropriate); (vi) Subproject is compatible with social, environmental,&#13;
andmine risk safeguards; (vii) The community has committed to contributing an amount&#13;
equal to at least 10 percent o f the Block Grant towards costs o f proposed subproject(s);&#13;
(viii) Subproject has an Operations andMaintenance Plan; and (ix) The CDC commits to&#13;
ensuring transparency inthe use o f Block Grant funds.&#13;
&#13;
Subproiects:        Two types o f subprojects are financed under NSP: (i)Community&#13;
infrastructure (the investments will comply with defined technical standards described in&#13;
the NSP Technical Manual, and only comprise public goods);' and (ii)                       Humancapital&#13;
development activities (e.g., time-bound literacy classes, hygiene education etc, that will&#13;
not incur recurrent costs from the state).&#13;
&#13;
In the case of subproject proposals involving rehabilitation or new construction of&#13;
schools, a condition for approval is the endorsement by the Ministryo f Education that the&#13;
proposed school fits within the overall planning o f the ministry, and that the ministry will&#13;
cover the operating costs o f the school (fully or with committed contributions from other&#13;
agencies).    If undertaken, rehabilitation and new construction of clinics will require&#13;
careful planningand coordination.&#13;
&#13;
Inclusion o f new returnees (refugees and Internally Displaced Persons who return to the&#13;
community after the initial CDC election i s held): Ifmore than 20 families return, the FP&#13;
facilitates a sub-election for each returnee cluster (comprised o f 20 families each) within&#13;
one month o f their return andthe community incorporates the new cluster representatives&#13;
into the CDC. The CDC revises the CDC Registration Application accordingly and&#13;
submits to the OC. If less than 20 families return, no elections are held but the CDC is&#13;
responsible for ensuring that returnees are encouraged to participate fully in subproject&#13;
committees and all program activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Such infrastructure projects would include, but not necessarily be restrictedto irrigationworks, roads&#13;
including culverts and small bridges, erosion protection, structures promoting watershed management,&#13;
water supply facilities, village electrification projects (ex. micro-hydropower), and school buildings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Community Development Plan and Subproiect Proposals:                In consultation with the&#13;
community at large, the CDC develops a Community Development Plan (CDP) that&#13;
prioritizes the specific needs o f the community, and proposes subprojects that address&#13;
these needs.    The facilitation o f an inclusive planning process in which various&#13;
stakeholders and interest groups have an opportunity to discuss their priorities is a key&#13;
step in the NSP methodology. The process promotes dialogue on community potentials,&#13;
opportunities and needs to produce a planthat i s holistic and strategic. It provides a basis&#13;
for coordinated government interventions at the community level, as well as sectoral&#13;
planningat the district, provincial andnational levels.&#13;
&#13;
4. Risks&#13;
&#13;
The NSP is a high risk - high reward program. While some of these risks can be&#13;
mitigated through measures incorporated inthe design o f the program, others are beyond&#13;
its reach and can only be closely monitored with adjustments made on a continuous basis.&#13;
The matrix below shows a summary o f the key operational risks, while Appendix 10&#13;
provides a more comprehensive risk analysis.&#13;

D. INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTSAND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Duringthe first three years o f implementation o f the NSP the MRRD has been assisted&#13;
by an internationally recruited Oversight Consultant (OC) to carry out the overall&#13;
management o f the program. Facilitation o f and technical guidance for the village level&#13;
project planning and implementation was outsourced to 24 international and national&#13;
NGOs (facilitating partners, FPs) and a UNagency. The FPs facilitated the mobilization&#13;
o f the target communities to form the CDCs and to provide them with technical guidance&#13;
for the management o f block grants and planning and implementation o f the subprojects&#13;
at village level using the block grants.&#13;
&#13;
The program was initially centralized. However, during the course o f the last two years&#13;
five regional offices have been established, and regional and provincial management&#13;
capacity has been slowly but consistently developed and strengthened, and project&#13;
oversight has been gradually decentralized to regional andprovincial offices.&#13;
&#13;
Most of MRRD civil servants at the central and provincial levels have been integrated&#13;
into the NSP management structure over the past two years. Two MRRD staff from&#13;
every province has been seconded to the provincial NSP OC offices to provide additional&#13;
engineering andmonitoring support.&#13;
&#13;
Taking into account the challenges and constraints that continue to be posed by the&#13;
operating environment, the NSP I1 institutional arrangements build on successful&#13;
elements o f the existing structure, but significant adjustments have also been introduced,&#13;
with a special attention to the institutional strengthening of the MRRD, reduction of&#13;
delivery costs, security riskmitigation, and decentralizationo f the program management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. InstitutionalArrangements for the NSPI1&#13;
&#13;
Implementation arrangements showing the project organizational setting and elaborating&#13;
the roles and responsibilities o f all project implementing partners at each level o f the&#13;
Government and community level are in Appendix 4. The implementing arrangement&#13;
over the next three years will rely on the regional and provincial office structure as was&#13;
the case inNSP I.  It is proposed, however, that it will have arather autonomous structure&#13;
withinthe MRRDas opposed to the OC ledimplementationstructure.&#13;
&#13;
The NSP I1management will continue to be supported by a reduced level o f international&#13;
technical assistance, while the MRRD will lead and provide the oversight for the&#13;
program. Unlike inthe first phase, inthe NSP 11, the MRRDwill carry out core functions&#13;
such as policy and strategy development and application, coordination with other&#13;
ministries, external relations with donors, resource mobilization, management o f relations&#13;
with FPs, appraisal, approval andprocessing o f subprojects, engineering, monitoring and&#13;
quality assurance - focusing on achievements, outcomes and program impact, and&#13;
training and capacity development at central andregional levels.&#13;
&#13;
Other functions, such as consolidated financial management, Block Grant Management&#13;
and Management Information System (MIS) operations will be outsourced to an external&#13;
consultant. All remaining operational h c t i o n s (including M&amp;E, Human Resource&#13;
Development, Procurement, General Administration, Public Communications,                FP&#13;
Management, and Technical Support) will be handled directly by MRRD NSP staff with&#13;
limitedtechnical assistance from international consultants. These MRRDstaff, however,&#13;
will be contracted staff and not MRRD civil servants as there is still an acute shortage of&#13;
civil servants within the MRRD.&#13;
&#13;
The staff o f the outsourced departments (Financial Management, Block Grant&#13;
Management andMIS) will remain employees o f the consultant while all national staff o f&#13;
the other departments will be contracted directly bythe MRRD.&#13;
&#13;
An inter-ministerial steering committee will guide the NSP for the overall policy,&#13;
strategic planning and management o f the project and for integration with other rural&#13;
development programs. Chaired by the Second Vice President o f the Government, the&#13;
Committee is represented by the Ministers o f Finance, Agriculture and Irrigation, Energy&#13;
and Water, Education, Public Health, Women's Affairs, Public Works, Rural&#13;
Rehabilitation andDevelopment, Justice and Interior.&#13;
&#13;
An external donor committee composed o f the donors financing the NSP I1will monitor&#13;
the program planning, implementation anddevelopment outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
The program will be managed by Management Units established at the central and&#13;
provincial levels. At the center, the Minister will be assisted by an Executive Director&#13;
responsible for policy formulation, program planning, external and donor relations,&#13;
budget and h d management and overall oversight. The Executive Director will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assisted by a Director o f Operations. The Executive Director will be a senior and&#13;
experienced Afghan national appointed by the MRRD within the existing government&#13;
civil service or selected through a competitive process. The Director o f Operations will&#13;
be an experienced and competent consultant who will bring international experience in&#13;
the planning and execution o f similar community driven development programs. The&#13;
Director o f Operations will be hired directly bythe MRRD.&#13;
&#13;
ManaPement Support Consultant (MSC)&#13;
&#13;
MRRD would hire a Management Support Consultant through international competition&#13;
to take responsibility for financial management, block grant management and MIS.&#13;
Outsourcing these functions aims to ensure accountability and transparency to donors and&#13;
stakeholders, and compliance with World Bank fiduciary rules andregulations. The main&#13;
management support responsibilities o f the MSC will include budget and financial&#13;
management, financial procedures &amp; controls, personnel administration, MIS, IT and&#13;
database and other management related information provision.&#13;
&#13;
At the field level, seven Regional Offices (ROs) will support the provincial RRD offices&#13;
inapprovingblock grants, liaisonwithFPs, overseeingthe procurement administrationof&#13;
subprojects andbuildlocal management capacities o f the provincial staff through on-the-&#13;
job training. The Provincial RRD offices will be responsible for overseeing the work o f&#13;
the FPs and for managing the outcome o f the NSP: the mobilization o f the communities,&#13;
formation o f the CDCs and planningand implementation o f the subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
Once the FPs complete their cycle o f support to and withdraw from the communities,&#13;
MRRDthrough these provincial offices will act as the primaryinterface between CDCs&#13;
andother development actors. These community leddevelopment teams o fthe provincial&#13;
offices will support and guide the CDC re-elections and potential revisions to the CDPs.&#13;
In addition once the CDC Constitution, which is under preparation by the MRRD, is&#13;
approved by the Government, these teams will facilitate the implementation o f the&#13;
provisions o f the Constitution at CDC level with further and future guidance from the&#13;
MRRD.&#13;
&#13;
Facilitating Partners (FPs)&#13;
&#13;
At present 24 facilitatingpartners are engaged inthe ongoing program.    The contracts o f&#13;
the FPs will expire on March 31, 2007. However, almost all these FPs will require&#13;
completing the ongoing community mobilization cycle leading to the satisfactory&#13;
completion o f subprojects, some beyond March 31,2007. Inaddition, FP services will be&#13;
required to ensure the continuity o f the program inthe NSP I1as the program rolls out to&#13;
new communities covering the districts where FPs are already present and new districts&#13;
whereno FPs are presently working.&#13;
&#13;
Communitv Development Councils (CDCs)&#13;
&#13;
CDCs will be the primary units responsible for the planning and execution o f the&#13;
subprojects under the facilitation and technical guidance o f the FPs. The CDC is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
community-based decision making body that includes a chairperson, vice-chairperson,&#13;
secretary, and treasurer. CDCs are responsible for overseeing and preparation o f the&#13;
CDP for their respective villages facilitated by the FPs. The CDPs are the basis for&#13;
identifying and prioritizing the block grant investments for subprojects in the villages.&#13;
The CDCs are also responsible for the management o f block grants within the village,&#13;
procurement o f subprojects and their implementation. Project Management Committee,&#13;
selected by the community, are responsible for withdrawal o f block grant funds from the&#13;
community account and procure the goods and services required to implement the&#13;
subprojects.     Additional subproject committees are established as preferred by the&#13;
communities to manage individual subprojects or oversee specific tasks such as&#13;
procurement, construction management etc.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation inHighRisk Areas&#13;
&#13;
The security environment inwhich the NSP operates has significantly deteriorated over&#13;
the course o f the program and is currently at its worst level. The number o f communities&#13;
and districts where NSP activities are suspended has steadily increased. The security&#13;
situation remains highly volatile and i s the single most important risk the NSP I1faces to&#13;
achieve its stated goals.&#13;
&#13;
The deterioration insecurity presents a number o f dilemmas. The government has made a&#13;
commitment to bringthe NSP to all rural communities, and communities yet to start with&#13;
the NSP are impatient. As part o f the national government, MRRD has the political&#13;
mandate and commitment to roll out to all areas o f the country. The NSP to date has&#13;
been considered by the communities as an effective rural development and village&#13;
governance/state building program. Its presence has ensured government visibility and&#13;
the perception that the government is taking responsibility for its citizens, even in the&#13;
most remote rural areas. It is also the Government's main vehicle to achieve rural&#13;
development benchmarks o f the I-ANDs. Precisely because NSP promotes the existing&#13;
government's interests, however, it has been targeted by anti-government elements linked&#13;
to drug trafficking, terrorist groups, and insurgency. If the NSP suspends its activities,&#13;
there i s a political risk that the absence o f government and support in those areas would&#13;
provide an advantage to anti-government elements to win sympathy and support from the&#13;
people inthose areas. On the other hand, to continue the NSP activities poses enormous&#13;
challenges o f physical insecurity (in the last year the number and casualties doubled),&#13;
higher delivery costs, and limited supervision (and therefore technical, fiduciary and&#13;
safeguard risks).&#13;
&#13;
The planning o f the implementation o f NSP I1in high risk areas therefore requires to&#13;
strike a pragmatic balance between the state building objectives o f the Government and&#13;
need to comply with the development effectiveness and outcomes as well as the diligent&#13;
fiduciary management o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
Extensive discussions have taken place with the FPs operating in insecure areas and&#13;
between the government and the OC to identify various options for planning and&#13;
implementing the NSP I1in high risk areas. Map 1 shows the districts where FPs are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
active at present and villages in those districts either partially or fully covered. Map 2&#13;
shows districts with low, moderate and high security risks at the time o f appraising the&#13;
project for illustrative purpose. Districts rated at low risk at present may become highrisk&#13;
area and vice versa during the course o f the implementation, andplanning o f the roll out&#13;
will needto be adjusted accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the current estimate, the NSP I1 is expected to cover an additional 4,318&#13;
villages in the next three years. This number is subject to change, however, due to the&#13;
dynamic and unpredictable nature o f the security situation. Sufficient flexibility has&#13;
therefore been incorporated in the cost tables and procurement planning. Actual rolling&#13;
out to new communities and districts will be adjusted during the implementation with&#13;
guidance from the National Steering Committee after proper assessment o f the security&#13;
conditions.&#13;
&#13;
Unwillingness o f the FP andprovincial/district staff to travel to risk prone villages could&#13;
undermine the achievement o f the development objectives o f the NSP 11. The restricted&#13;
accessibility would pose many other potential programmatic, fiduciary, and reputational&#13;
risks. These include: (i)  inability to mobilize and train CDCs to ensure transparency and&#13;
equity in carrying out a democratic election leading to potential risk o f capturing the&#13;
decisionmakingpower o f CDCs and misappropriation o f fundingby elites, warlords, and&#13;
anti-government elements; (ii)    inability to supervise diligently, the financial management&#13;
and procurement administration o f the subprojects and block grant disbursements and&#13;
accounting;     (iii)reduced quality of the design, billing and construction of the&#13;
subprojects leading to potential avenues o f corruption, potential risk o f block grants&#13;
ending up partially in the hands o f anti-government elements, and questionable&#13;
usefulness and sustainability o f the subprojects; and (iv) risk to life o f the operating staff.&#13;
&#13;
Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to filly respect the NSP guiding principles&#13;
inpursuit of the NSP objectives ininsecure areas. Inhighrisk areas the main threat to&#13;
the NSP objectives is the inability to establish the foundation for local governance, as FPs&#13;
have restricted access to the communities and therefore cannot offer the full facilitation&#13;
support to develop the capacity o f the CDCs and to ensure the CDCs are representative&#13;
and consultative in their formulation o f the community development plan. As a result,&#13;
the focus is more on the delivery o f state building services, rather than inclusive local&#13;
governance. This means that any alternative approach is only realistic in communities&#13;
that have already been mobilized, elected their CDCs, formulated their development&#13;
plans, andwhere subprojects have already been reviewed and approved by the OC. It is&#13;
not possible to facilitate the governance component o f the program by remote control,&#13;
when FPs cannot access the communities.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, it has been agreed that the project, through the National Steering Committee,&#13;
will obtain guidance for program planning and implementation in the high risk areas,&#13;
particularly for the roll out to new communities and new districts. If the accessibility o f&#13;
these villages and districts is restricted, the program roll out to new communities andnew&#13;
districts will not take place until the Steering Committee recommends that the security&#13;
situation has eased off, the concerned Communities are willing to receive the services o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FPs, the concerned FP and the staff o f the Regional staff are willing to travel to those&#13;
areas, and the Bank task team i s confident that satisfactory arrangements for&#13;
implementation supervision, monitoring and fiduciary compliance are inplace.&#13;
&#13;
Inthe case of communities inhighrisk areas who have been partially mobilized and&#13;
already included inthe ongoing FP contracts, a different distance based approach will be&#13;
utilized. If in any village the CDC is already in place, CDP has been developed, and&#13;
subprojects have been approved by the OC, then the CDC will allow to proceed with the&#13;
implementation. Inthose instances, the subproject implementation would rely on trusted&#13;
and respected independent community members, who could verify the use o f block grant&#13;
funds andthe status of implementation. Inaddition, the project implementation will rely&#13;
upon the monitoring by community level procurement and financial management sub-&#13;
committees. However, technically complex subprojects, such as micro-hydro power,&#13;
would not be implementedinthe absence o fproper technical support.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the initial implementation experience with the above proxy oversight and&#13;
monitoring arrangements, other possible alternative implementation approaches for the&#13;
project implementation in risk areas would be explored later during the implementation&#13;
phase.&#13;
&#13;
3. BudgetandCo-Financing&#13;
&#13;
Program andProject Budget&#13;
&#13;
The second phase o f the National Solidarity Program plans to achieve national coverage&#13;
(all districts) increasing the number o f total CDCs to 21,600 (that is 90 percent o f an&#13;
estimated total o f 24,000 rural communities2). The three year timeframe for the second&#13;
phase i s expected to allow at least 75 percent o f these CDCs to have disbursed their block&#13;
grant. Within these assumptions, the total fundingrequirement for this three year period&#13;
is estimated to be about US$525 million.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the proposed IDA Grant, further resources are expected through ARTF&#13;
(US$244 million), JSDF (US$30 million), and bilateral contributions together with other&#13;
sources o f funding to be identified duringimplementation (USS130 million),&#13;
&#13;
ARTF&#13;
&#13;
The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) represents one mechanism for co-&#13;
financing o f the NSP. The ARTF is one o f the main instruments available to the&#13;
Government o f Afghanistan to finance key recurrent expenditures (salaries, capital&#13;
expenditures, operations and maintenance of key government institutions), as well as&#13;
finance urgent investments and reconstruction activities planned in the country's&#13;
&#13;
       ~~          ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2 It is not known at the current stage how many rural communities exist in Afghanistan, there are just&#13;
estimates. At its inception the NSP assumed a total number o f 22,000 rural communities or villages, raising&#13;
this number over time to 24,000. The National Rural Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) using a different&#13;
approach estimates 38,000 rural settlements. NSP villages cluster on average 1.5 rural settlements. For&#13;
everyNSP village there is one CommunityDevelopment Council(CDC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
economic recovery program. The ARTF can either finance free-standing projects or co-&#13;
finance IDA or other donor-funded projects. Modalities have been developedby IDA, as&#13;
ARTF Administrator, to allow donors to express preferences for a priority program or&#13;
project included in the government multi-year development budget, and for which the&#13;
government has requested ARTF funding. To maintain the integrity and principles&#13;
underlying a multi-donor Trust Fund, the ARTF cannot be used exclusively for the&#13;
purpose o f financing specific programs or projects. Donors who express a specific&#13;
preference are expected to also contribute to the general allocation.     The amount for&#13;
which the preference i s being expressed cannot exceed 50 percent o f the donor's total&#13;
contribution in a given Afghan Fiscal Year (Solar Year - SY). In a non-legally binding&#13;
side letter to the Agreement, IDA will communicate its confidence that ARTF will fund&#13;
the designated program up to the amount expressed by the donor and this amount would&#13;
be transferred from the general fund to the specific project fund.&#13;
&#13;
As of August, 2006, cumulative ARTF contributions for the first phase o f the NSP&#13;
amounted to US$122 million. The amount o f ARTF contribution expected for the NSP I1&#13;
i s twice as much for the same period o f time. This i s in consideration o f (i)the&#13;
expression o f interest o f additional new donors to join the NSP financing, (ii)      the&#13;
establishment o f a special external affairs and fund raising function in the NSP&#13;
management, and (iii)  the inclusion o f additional ARTF funds that have beenpledged and&#13;
that would be made available before the start o f the NSP 11.&#13;
&#13;
JSDF&#13;
&#13;
The Japan Social Development Fund(JSDF) was established by the Government o f Japan&#13;
andthe World Bank inJune 2000 as an untiedmechanism for providing direct assistance&#13;
to the poorest and most vulnerable groups in eligible member countries o f the World&#13;
Bank Group. The main purposes o f the JSDF are to: (i)        Support innovative programs&#13;
which directly respond to the needs o f the poorest andmost vulnerable groups insociety;&#13;
(ii) rapidanddemonstrablebenefits, whichcanbesustained,tothepoorestand&#13;
     Provide&#13;
most vulnerable groups; and (iii) capacity, participation and empowerment of civil&#13;
                                  Build&#13;
society, local communities andNGOs.&#13;
&#13;
The Government o f Japan and the World Bank agreed to set up a special window within&#13;
the JSDF to support activities in Afghanistan under a program o f assistance for the&#13;
country's reconstruction andtransition toward political, economic and social stability.&#13;
&#13;
As o f August, 2006, cumulative JSDF contributions for the first phase o f the NSP&#13;
amounted to US$26 million. Based on preliminary discussion with the Japanese&#13;
authorities, the expected financing from the JSDF for the next three years i s expected to&#13;
be inthe order o f about US$30 million.&#13;
&#13;
Bilateral Parallel Financing&#13;
&#13;
The government's preferred co-financing mechanism would be joint co-financing under&#13;
an arrangement where funds from different donors are channeled through the Treasury or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
through multi-donor trust funds such as the ARTF. Some donors however could not, for&#13;
different reasons, pool their resources with other co-financiers, and it is expected that in&#13;
the NSP I1there will still be a portion o f the program financing that will be channeled&#13;
under direct bilateral agreements between the Government and the donors. It is expected&#13;
that additional funds will be provided to the order o f 3-5 percent o fthe total budget.&#13;
&#13;
Other Sources o f Financing&#13;
&#13;
Other sources o f financing to complete the budget needs have not been identified at this&#13;
stage. Taking in consideration the projected financial plan, the program i s likely to be&#13;
currently under-funded for an estimated 25-30 percent o f the total. However, because o f&#13;
the scope and outreach o f the NSP, and the attractive program performance, it i s&#13;
reasonable to expect that additional funding will be made available during&#13;
implementation, including IDA supplemental funding. Under the NSP 11, an MRRD&#13;
officer will be incharge of public relation initiatives and fund raising for the program.&#13;
&#13;
4. Procurement&#13;
&#13;
The Procurement administration o f the NSP I1 would be carried out in accordance with&#13;
the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated&#13;
M a y 2004, "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers" dated M a y 2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement.&#13;
For each contract to be financed by the Grant the different procurement methods or&#13;
consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review&#13;
requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Grant Recipient and the Bank&#13;
project team are described in the Procurement Plan agreed with the Government at&#13;
appraisal and finalized during negotiations. This Procurement Plan will be updated at&#13;
least annually or at lesser time intervals as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvements inthe institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementMethods&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of Works: A largemajority o f the works to be procured under this project&#13;
would include community sub-projects. These subprojects are implemented by the&#13;
communities using Block Grant provisions made by the project. Each community will&#13;
get a Block Grant o fUS$200per familywith anupper ceiling o f limit o fUS$ 60,000 per&#13;
community. Therefore, the estimated value o f most o f the community subprojects would&#13;
be lesser than US$ 60,000 per project. Community will carry out procurement following&#13;
paragraph 3.17 o f Bank's Guidelines. The detailed procurement procedures are listed&#13;
under the procurement chapter in the Operational Manual. The OM includes shopping,&#13;
direct contracting and other methods for the procurement o f gooddand works for the&#13;
community subprojects for the selection o f individuals to provide the necessary&#13;
professional inputs inthe implementation o f the subprojects. The procurement o f all other&#13;
works contracts will be done using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National SBD agreed with (or satisfactory&#13;
to) the Bank for all National Competitive Bidding (NCB) and other procurement&#13;
methods. A sample bidding document for N C B has already been agreed between the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Bank andthe MRRD.All contract estimated to more thanUS$ 100,000 will be procured&#13;
following N C B procedures and contracts below US$ 100,000 will be procured following&#13;
shoppingprocedures&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of Goods: All goods contracts estimated to cost more than US$ 200,000&#13;
will be procured following ICB procedures. The contracts estimated to cost more than&#13;
US$ 100,000 and less thanUS$200,000 will be procured following N C B procedures and&#13;
contract estimated to cost less than US$ 100, 000 will be procured following shopping&#13;
procedures, With the prior agreement with IDA, Direct Contract method will be used to&#13;
procure goods and services which meet the requirements as per the provision under&#13;
paragraph 3.6 o f Bank's Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Selection of Consultants: There will be a large number o f Technical Assistance (TA)&#13;
contracts under the project. These TA will include the hiring o f Management Support&#13;
Consultant (MSC) and Facilitating Partners (FPs), totaling around 78 contracts.            The&#13;
MSC will provide the management oversight support and technical assistance to the&#13;
MRRD at center and provincial offices and manage the FP contracts. A shortlist has&#13;
already been prepared for the selection o f the MSC and the procurement process i s&#13;
underway to ensure that MSC begins operations fiom April 1, 2007. There are 24&#13;
ongoing FP contracts awarded to international and national NGOs. These FPs are already&#13;
active inall 34 provinces o f the country covering 276 districts out o f total 364 districts o f&#13;
the country.&#13;
&#13;
The FP contracts under NSP Iwill end by March 31, 2007. However, these contracts&#13;
need to be continued to complete the second and third year cycles o f community&#13;
facilitation process o f the communities included in the NSP I.An estimated number o f&#13;
6,866 communities will undergo the third year cycle, and 5,005 communities will&#13;
undergo both year 2 and year 3 cycles. These contract assignments couldbe considered in&#13;
compliance with paragraph 3.9-3.12 o f Bank's Guidelines for the Selection o f&#13;
Consultants and the Government, and IDA agreed that the ongoing FP contract that will&#13;
expire on March 31, 2007 will be extended following Single Source Selection (SSS)&#13;
Procedure.&#13;
&#13;
As the NSP I1rolls out around 4,300 new communities will be added to the program in&#13;
districts where the present FPs are already active and in districts where no FP has moved&#13;
to yet. A SSS and competitive selection process would be followed respectivelyto select&#13;
the FPs for such districts. The selection o f consultants under the project will include&#13;
QCBS, QBS, CQS, LCS, FBS SSS and individual consultants inaccordance with Section&#13;
V o f bank's Guidelines for the Selection o f Consultants. Threshold for CQS procedure&#13;
willbeUS$200,000 per contract.&#13;
&#13;
Individual consultancy contracts will be procured following Section V o f Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for the Selection o f Consultants. Short lists for services estimated to cost less&#13;
than$50,000 equivalent per contract maybe composed entirely o fnational consultants in&#13;
accordance with the provisions o fparagraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Incremental Operational Costs will be procured using the implementing agency's&#13;
administrative procedures which were reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Assessment o f the agency's capacity to implement procurement&#13;
&#13;
An assessment o f the capacity o f the MRRD and the NSP unit to implement the&#13;
procurement actions under the project was carried out in September 2006. The&#13;
assessment reviewed the proposed organizational structure for the implementation o f the&#13;
NSP and the capacity o f the MRRD is adequate to handle the procurement activities o f&#13;
the proposed project. The NSP Unit will be responsible for day-to-day project&#13;
management including procurement, financial management, progress and financial&#13;
reporting, staff appointment and management, andproject monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
The MRRD currently procures items such as vehicles, generators, pumps, office&#13;
equipment etc using their own resources as well as the funds received from the other&#13;
donors. The Deputy Minister for Programs has delegated the authority to approve&#13;
procurements valued up to AF250, 000 (approximately US$S,OOO) and the Minister has&#13;
delegated the authority to approve procurements valued up to AF3, 000,000 (US$60,000)&#13;
underthe current ProcurementLaw.&#13;
&#13;
However in order to strengthen the capacity o f the MRRD, capacity buildingprograms&#13;
are planned (See Appendix 5). Inaddition, provisions are included in the project's cost&#13;
estimate to provide advanced procurement training to 1-2 selected procurement staff o f&#13;
the MRRD at a reputed overseas institute as a measure for long term procurement&#13;
capacity building o f the MRRD. These internationally trained staff will be used as&#13;
trainers to train a cadre o f local procurement staff within the MRRD during the project&#13;
period.&#13;
&#13;
While the procurement risk at the MRRD level could be considered as "Average", as the&#13;
majority o f the procurement i s carried out by communities at the village level that risk i s&#13;
"High". However such high risk will be mitigated by having clear procurement&#13;
procedures in the manual and training o f communities to comply with such procedures&#13;
and also by social audit."&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Plan&#13;
&#13;
The Grant Recipient,      at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project&#13;
implementationwhich provides the basis for the procurement methods. The planwill also&#13;
be available in the Project's database, NSP website (www.nspafghanistan.org), and on&#13;
the Bank's external website (www.worldbank.ordaf). The Procurement Plan will be&#13;
updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual&#13;
project implementation needs andimprovements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Supervision&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the&#13;
capacity assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended one procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
review per year in the field to carry out post review of procurement actions and the&#13;
compliance with the agreed procedures at community level. Inaddition, as recommended&#13;
by the Operational Procurement Review Committee (OPRC), the Bank will carry out a&#13;
financial audit o fthe ongoing contract o f the OC and audit recommendations will be used&#13;
as a learningground to further improve the quality o f procurement supervision o f all TA&#13;
contracts o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
Social Audit&#13;
&#13;
Considering that procurement under the large number o f subprojects will be carried out&#13;
bycommunities and due to large sum o f subprojects, it would not be feasible to carry-out&#13;
procurement review/audit as in a normal investment project. Therefore it i s proposed to&#13;
carryout a social audit through participatory and transparent process. Institutional&#13;
arrangements for social audit at the village level (CDC) will provide the framework&#13;
needed to ensure that there i s checks//balances and transparency in the procurement&#13;
process including access to information related to procurement. The information related&#13;
to procurement under block grants will be disseminated to the public. Such infomation&#13;
will be provided inthe notice board o f the village mosque, CDC office notice board and&#13;
NSP website. In addition the information i s disclosed at village meetings as per the&#13;
current practice under NSP. Experience has shown that social audit including&#13;
participatory and transparent process i s the most powerful tool to ensure the funds are&#13;
used for the purposes intended.&#13;
&#13;
5. FinancialManagement,DisbursementandAudit&#13;
&#13;
A PFM performance rating system has been recently developed for Afghanistanby the&#13;
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) multi-agency partnership&#13;
program, which includes the World Bank, IMF, EC, and other agencies. Afghanistan's&#13;
ratings against the PFM performance indicators portray a public sector where financial&#13;
resources are, by and large, being used for their intended purposes as authorized by a&#13;
budget that i s processed with transparency and has contributed to aggregate fiscal&#13;
discipline.&#13;
&#13;
Financial management and audit functions for proposed project will be undertaken&#13;
through the agents contracted under the Public Administration Capacity Buildingproject.&#13;
This is the primaryinstrument for continuing to strengthen the fiduciary measures put in&#13;
place for ensuring transparency and accountability o f funds provided by the Bank and&#13;
other donors. Under these contracts, two advisers-Financial     Management and Audit-&#13;
are responsible for working with the government and line ministries to carry out these&#13;
core functions. The Financial Management Agent (FMA) i s responsible for helping the&#13;
MoF maintain the accounts for all public expenditures, including IDA-financed projects&#13;
andfor buildingcapacitywithinthe government offices for these functions.&#13;
&#13;
At present, financial management at project level has been outsourced to the Oversight&#13;
Consultant (OC). In the NSP 11, the financial management responsibility will be&#13;
transferred to a Management Support Consultant (MSC) to be appointed at the end o f&#13;
OC'S contract in April 2007. The OC/MSC will utilize a computerized accounting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
system to maintain relevant accounting records and generate required periodic reports on&#13;
the project activities. This accounting system which will also be utilized for the financial&#13;
management o f block grant to communities for sub-projects will be integrated with&#13;
monitoring and evaluation by the M I S unit within the MSC, to ensure a close link&#13;
between technicaVprogress reporting and financial reporting, and to support the validity&#13;
o fthe expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be prepared by the MSC/MRRD finance&#13;
department. Consolidatedproject reports will be prepared, reviewed, and approvedby the&#13;
MoF, supported bythe FMA.&#13;
&#13;
A Designated Account (DA), will be opened at D a Afghanistan Bank (DAB, Central&#13;
Bank) or in a local commercial bank in the name o f the project on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to IDA.The DA will be maintainedby the MoF. Withdrawal applications for&#13;
replenishment will be submitted monthly. Financial management arrangements for the&#13;
project are detailed inAppendix 7.&#13;
&#13;
FundFlows&#13;
&#13;
Fund management for the Gran will follow existing procedures. As with all public&#13;
expenditure, all payments under the project will be routed through MoF. The FM Agent&#13;
will assist the MoF inexecuting and recordingproject payments. Inkeeping with current&#13;
practices for other projects in Afghanistan, the DA will be operated by the Special&#13;
Disbursement Unit (SDU) inthe Treasury DepartmentMoF. Requests for payments from&#13;
DA funds will be made to the SDUbyMRRD. Inaddition to payments from DA funds,&#13;
MRRD can also request the SDU to make direct payments to consultants or consulting&#13;
firms, and special commitments for contracts covered by letters o f credit. Such requests&#13;
will follow World Bank procedures.        All withdrawal applications to IDA, including&#13;
replenishment, reimbursement, and direct payment applications, will be prepared and&#13;
submitted byMoF.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting andReporting&#13;
&#13;
A Financial Management Manual will be prepared by MSC/MRRD documenting the&#13;
financial management arrangements for the project. The manual will outline guidelines&#13;
for project activities including specific requirements for communities benefiting from&#13;
block grants for sub-projects, and establish a project financial management system in&#13;
accordance with standard Afghan government policies and procedures. This will include&#13;
use o f the Chart o f Accounts developed by the FMA to record project expenditure.&#13;
Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in MoF, through the SDU and supported&#13;
by the FMA. Consolidated Project Financial Statements will be prepared for all sources&#13;
anduses o fproject expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
DisbursementMethod&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements from the IDA Grant will be transaction-based, with replenishment,&#13;
reimbursement, direct payment, andpayments under Special Commitments including full&#13;
documentation or against statements o f expenditures, as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Audit o fProiect Funds&#13;
&#13;
The Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, is responsible for auditing the&#13;
accounts of all IDA-financed projects. Annual audited project financial statements will&#13;
be submitted within six months o f the close o f GOA'Sfiscal year. The audit agreement&#13;
include audit o f CDCs on random basis.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
&#13;
To provide maximum financing flexibility, it has been agreed that the Government may&#13;
claim up to US$40,000,000 (33 % o f the IDA grant amount) as retroactive financing for&#13;
expenditures financed after October 1, 2006 and prior to the signing date o f the Grant&#13;
Agreement,&#13;
&#13;
6. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
The NSP Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Department o f the MRRD will be&#13;
responsible for coordinating the M&amp;E tasks, liaising with FPs, provincial M&amp;E staff and&#13;
OC in the collection and reporting o f the required data. The M&amp;E data will be&#13;
continuously updated and consolidated quarterly for provision to the Bank task team, and&#13;
will be made available to coincide with the supervisionmissions o fthe project. The M&amp;E&#13;
department will be supported by the Provincial M&amp;E staff as well as the FPs at the&#13;
province and district level.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationMonitoring&#13;
&#13;
At community level, CDCs will be responsible, with the support from the FPs, for&#13;
monitoring their own progress based on a few selected key indicators (e.g. on&#13;
process/participation, implementation progress/results, and expenditures). At the same&#13;
time, a well designed community participatory monitoring system will be piloted during&#13;
the first six months and expanded if successful. Communities will monitor procurement,&#13;
financial management, implementation and maintenance o f the subprojects, and FP's&#13;
performance   .&#13;
&#13;
Facilitating Partners (FPs) will continue to be responsible for the implementation&#13;
monitoring, focusing on inputs, process and output level, using the communities as the&#13;
basic unit of monitoring. The FPs will prepare a brief monthly report on the&#13;
implementation status.&#13;
&#13;
At district level, FPs will prepare quarterlyprogress reports, which cover the district(s) or&#13;
province(s) inwhich the particular FP is responsible for the facilitation o fNSP.&#13;
&#13;
At Province level, FPs will prepare a quarterly report based on the district reports and&#13;
feed the M I S with the information collected. The Provincial M&amp;E staff of MRRD will&#13;
further assess the quality o f the subprojects as well as the governance capacity o f CDCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
At the national level, MRRD M&amp;E department will analyze the data collected and&#13;
prepare quarterly progress reports for the project as a whole, which will be shared with&#13;
key stakeholders. The MRRDwill provide monthly progress reportsto the Bankandany&#13;
other reports required by the Bank andthe National Steering Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Post-implementation monitoring&#13;
&#13;
The objectives are primarily to assess the sustainability o f the subprojects and the&#13;
governance capacity o f CDCs beyond subproject completion. This will be carried out, on&#13;
random sample basis, by the NSP M&amp;E department three and six months after the&#13;
subprojects are completed.&#13;
&#13;
Complaints Handling&#13;
&#13;
A Complaints Handling Mechanism will be introduced in NSP 11. This serves as an&#13;
important channel for the community members to report their complaints especially when&#13;
there are problems vis-&amp;vis the FPs or other aspects o f the program. A Complaints&#13;
HandlingSpecialist inthe MRRDwillbe hired anda phone numberpublicized onposters&#13;
where communities can directly call or send an SMS. There will also be a suggestion box&#13;
at strategic areas such as mosques, community halls, markets, and shops. The complaints&#13;
can also come from facilitators. The complaints will be collected by Fops once a month&#13;
inthe presence o f designated CDC membersandhandedover to provincial offices under&#13;
confidential cover to be transmittedto the Complaints HandlingSpecialist inthe MRRD.&#13;
The incoming complaints are categorized and registered into database by the Complaints&#13;
Handling Specialist. Verification and problem solving will be followed-up by both the&#13;
FPs and the Complaints Handling Specialist. Should there be complaints regarding the&#13;
FPs, the Complaints Handling Specialist, together with MRRD and MSC will decide on&#13;
the most appropriate and timely actions. Complaints handling Specialist i s expected to&#13;
prepare a monthly summary o f the complaints received, actions taken and outcomes and&#13;
share the report with the NSP core staff including the Executive Director and Director&#13;
Operations as well as the Bank's task team. If there are alleged or suspected corruption&#13;
cases, the Bank will take appropriate action to investigate those cases immediately. If&#13;
complaints have larger policy, political or security implications, MRRD will consult the&#13;
Steering Committee for the next steps.&#13;
&#13;
Baseline Survev&#13;
&#13;
During the facilitation process, FPs will collect some key basic information o f the&#13;
communities, such as demographic data, availability o f resources etc., using a&#13;
standardized form called "Community Profile Form". The data will be entered into the&#13;
M I S and be analyzed to generate baseline information. A GPS code will be added to the&#13;
form inorder to provide accurate geographical position o f targeted communities.&#13;
&#13;
Ex-post Review&#13;
&#13;
A number o f verification and ex-post review mechanisms on utilization o f block grants&#13;
are inplace and are described indetail inthe NSO Operation Manual. At the CDC level,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
elected Project Management Committee i s designated to withdraw funds and procure&#13;
goods and services on behalf o f the community. These committees are supported by&#13;
community level sub committees on procurement, financial management, monitoring and&#13;
M&amp;E. Fops verify the usage o fblock grants andthe physical status o f subprojects when&#13;
they recommend the provincial oversight offices to release o f block grant installments.&#13;
Also once a subproject is completed, FPs carry out an ex-post review o f all the&#13;
subprojects and submit a completion report endorsing that the subproject has been&#13;
satisfactorily completed both in quantity and quality.     Release o f the final block grant&#13;
installment to CDCs i s based on this verification. In addition, provincial OC staff i s&#13;
expected to verify the usage o f block grants and subproject completion at least on a 10%&#13;
sample o f CDCs in each district. In addition, the project will carry out analytical work,&#13;
inter-alias, to assess the construction quality o f the subprojects as an integral activity o f&#13;
theproposedM&amp;Estrategy.&#13;
&#13;
Impact Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
The absence o f a baseline beyond the community profile made it difficult inthe NSP Ito&#13;
accurately assess the economic, political, and social impact o f NSP implementation on&#13;
targeted communities. Information on the role o f CDCs in facilitating institutional&#13;
changes at village-level has been particularly absent. NSP I1will therefore finance an&#13;
impact evaluation, focusing on key institutional indicators o f CDCs in addition to some&#13;
basic socio-economic data. As a methodology, randomization o f communities will be&#13;
used, by randomly selecting communities which receive the project within a targeted&#13;
district, and by assigning randomly the control groups to those which do not. The&#13;
communities o fthe control groups will be eventually coveredby the project duringyear 2&#13;
and year 3 o f the project. Randomization i s considered to be the most reliable way to&#13;
compose a credible comparison group, which would have hadoutcomes identical to those&#13;
communities that were exposed to the project. Due to the fact that project communities&#13;
andcontrol communities are compared through arandomprocess, systematic pre-existing&#13;
differences between those that receive the program and those that do not can be&#13;
identified.&#13;
&#13;
Analytical Works&#13;
&#13;
Running analytical work in parallel to the ongoing activities will enable an iterative&#13;
process whereby findings from the field can be fed into design modification. Running a&#13;
longitudinal qualitative analytical work also enables to look at the process o f how local&#13;
dynamics change over the course o f program intervention. Some important themes&#13;
include: women's empowerment, changing roles among different local actors, changes&#13;
over time in villager's decision-making /dispute resolution process, changes in the&#13;
government's service delivery mechanism etc. Other technical studies which are equally&#13;
important in improving the quality o f program include engineering design quality o f&#13;
electrification projects, construction quality o f sub-projects, social and environmental&#13;
impact o f sub-projects, and economic rate o f return analysis. FPs will be asked to write&#13;
up case studies oncertain topics which canbewidely shared as lessons learned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Mid-termReview&#13;
&#13;
Duringthe second year o f the project, a mid-term review will be conducted in order to&#13;
assess whether the NSP I1i s achieving the objectives as planned, and to initiate corrective&#13;
measures ifdeemed necessary.&#13;
&#13;
ExternalEvaluations&#13;
&#13;
At the end o f the three years, an external evaluation will assess NSP impact andprovide&#13;
recommendations for a third (and final) phase o f consolidation. The evaluation will&#13;
specifically assess whether the target set in Appendix 2 had been achieved at the end of&#13;
the project, based on findings from the analytical works, the impact evaluation and&#13;
monitoring records during the project. An independent external evaluation will also be&#13;
carried out to evaluate the performance of the Management Support Consultant and&#13;
FacilitatingPartners.&#13;
&#13;
7. ProjectCommunicationUnit&#13;
&#13;
Since September 2003, the Oversight Consultant               (OC)   established a Public&#13;
Communication Unit (PCU) to raise awareness about the program's objectives and to&#13;
disseminate program's achievements. As o f December 2005, the PCU produced about 4&#13;
hours o f broadcast TV news, 15 hours o f documentaries, and 100 hours o f radio&#13;
broadcast divided in features stories, news and soap opera episodes. It produced about&#13;
75,000 print media products (posters, brochures leaflets, poem books and news articles),&#13;
eight exposure trips, and one national Community Development Councils congress. The&#13;
total cost estimated o fthe PCUis about US$1.2 million a year.&#13;
&#13;
During the first semester o f 2006, the PCU carried out a baseline assessment to&#13;
understand the level o f awareness and perception o f NSP program effectiveness. As a&#13;
result, a new communication strategy was outlined. The strategy was developed in&#13;
consultation with representatives o f MRRD, Facilitating Partners (FPs), the CDCs the&#13;
UN,andthe WorldBank.&#13;
&#13;
The NSP I1 Communication approach aims at consolidating the existing PCU&#13;
communication activities based on the findings and recommendations provided by the&#13;
baseline assessment. It creates a multi-functional and multi-dimensional communication&#13;
framework: (i)   communication to enhance projects effectiveness and help achieve the&#13;
intended operational results,      (ii)communication for education,          learning and&#13;
dissemination o f information to large audiences, (iii)communication for relationship and&#13;
coalition building, social and political mobilization, donors relations and institutional&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
The primary objective o f the NSP I1communication strategy is to build trust in the&#13;
government ability to lead the country's reconstruction. The secondary objective is to&#13;
assure a broad knowledge and understanding o f the program and to help sustain the&#13;
existing institutional and public support for the project. The tertiary objective is to&#13;
strengthen the coordination among donors to facilitate find raising and enhance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
continuous support to the program. These objectives will be achievedby setting up a two-&#13;
way communication mechanism that goes beyond one-way information dissemination,&#13;
thus allowing the NSP and MRRD to positively interact with all stakeholders. A&#13;
summaryo fthe agreed communicationstrategy is inAppendix 12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMICJUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
1. Project Benefits&#13;
&#13;
The NSP block grants are used to build economically productive infrastructure. Returns&#13;
on NSP outputs are immediate and the evidence suggests that their benefits to villagers&#13;
are high. A sample o f 22 NSP subprojects selected for economic analysis showed&#13;
economic rates o f return (ERR) averaging 26.3 to 60.8 percent, with an overall ERR&#13;
weighted average o f 38.2 percent, and a net present value (NPV) at US$1.186 million.&#13;
These results were obtained assuming that 30 percent o f the NSP I1subprojects could fail&#13;
because o f poor design and/or the growing conflicting situations inhighrisk areas. Water&#13;
supply projects show the highest ERR at an average o f 60.8 percent due to their large&#13;
benefits stemming from time and costs saved by family members for collecting and/or&#13;
obtaining water. These figures do not yet include the benefits from improved health&#13;
conditions due to the supply o f safe water. Road and bridge projects show an average&#13;
ERR o f 26.6 percent, resulting from time savings and from significant increases in&#13;
agricultural product sales, decrease in transport costs to bring products to market, and&#13;
opening o f market opportunities. The irrigation projects show an ERR averaging 38.5&#13;
percent and the energy subprojects average an ERR at 26.3 percent.          N o value was&#13;
assigned to the improvement o f governance, nor to the benefits expected to be generated&#13;
bythe follow-up projects that the CDCs are already implementing.&#13;
&#13;
The economic sensitivity o f the program to the major risk facing the country was also&#13;
tested. The on-going armed conflict could result in further aggravation o f the security&#13;
situation in rural villages increasing the risk o f subproject sustainability. In the case&#13;
subprojects failure would reach 50 percent instead o f the assumed 30 percent, the ERR&#13;
could fall from 38.2 percent to 27 percent. On the contrary, ifthe situation improves and&#13;
scheme failures drop to only 15 percent, the ERR could be increased to 46.4 percent.&#13;
These results allow concluding that the NSP has a very low probability o f failure. It could&#13;
be safely concluded that it is a very strong probability that the NSP will continue to be&#13;
the strongest vehicle for the country's post-war reconstruction inrural areas.&#13;
&#13;
A cost efficiency analysis was also conducted at two levels: (i) block grant delivery&#13;
                                                                  the&#13;
costs (including MRRD, Oversight Consultants and FPs) as compared with international&#13;
experience; and (ii)the cost comparison o f typical block grant investments at the&#13;
community level, with other modalities o f investments for delivering the same services in&#13;
Afghanistan. At the end o f NSP I1delivery and community development costs would&#13;
represent about 28.5 percent o f the total program costs which compares favorably&#13;
worldwide. For all analyzedNSP type o f investments, the delivery costs o f NSP resulted&#13;
cost effective. The analysis included the 5 sectors which account for 96 percent o f NSP&#13;
BG investments: Water &amp; Sanitation, Transportation, Power, Irrigation and Education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
According to an analysis carried out during appraisal, delivering Water &amp; Sanitation,&#13;
Irrigation, Education, Transportation and Power projects through the NSP costs on&#13;
average 31percent less than ifdone through other ministries andprograms.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The economic analysis o f the NSP I1 confirms that the NSP i s having a solid and&#13;
sustainable financial impact on beneficiaries. NSP non-quantified most important impact&#13;
i s expected to relay in its contribution for building governance throughout Afghanistan.&#13;
Delivery costs are in line with international standards and the C B D K D D approach i s&#13;
creating the foundations for other development projects to build over the local human,&#13;
social and institutional capital being developed. The strengthening o f the financial&#13;
situation o f beneficiaries, the employment generation, and the women participation inthe&#13;
process are also significant contributions for poverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
2. Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability o fthe NSP&#13;
&#13;
The project will cover the first three years o f a seven-year government proposal for the&#13;
expansion and consolidation o f the program. There is no plan to extend NSP beyond the&#13;
proposed seven years. Any further activity beyond that period applies to the community&#13;
councils established through NSP, not to NSP itself. CDC's can play three important&#13;
roles in the bigger picture o f Afghanistan's longer-term development. First, CDC's for&#13;
the first time provide the central government with an effective means to deliver basic&#13;
services across the entire country. Second, CDC's could carry out certain basic&#13;
administrative functions provided that they received a core block grant through the&#13;
budget. Third, CDC's could be grouped to provide representative planningbodies at the&#13;
district level that would advise local government. These three options to a large extent&#13;
hinge on the central government's vision for subnational government and administration.&#13;
A more sustained role for CDC's would be equally compatible with continued&#13;
centralization or ina more deconcentrated system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Sustainabilitv o fthe CDCs&#13;
&#13;
The central sustainability goal o f the government i s therefore to ensure the continuity o f&#13;
the CDCs as a permanent part o f the governance system and for them to evolve to&#13;
become the primary service delivery instrument for rural development. However, funds&#13;
alone will not guarantee the long-term sustainability o f CDCs.           A national public&#13;
consultation o f elected CDCs found that their position as a representative institution in&#13;
the villages will only be achieved if they secure legitimacy through legal recognition o f&#13;
and status for the CDC as an institution. Without this, the CDC members rightlybelieve&#13;
that they have no legitimacy in any political or developmental context outside o f the&#13;
NSP. The CDCs must be recognized by all the government ministries and enshrined in&#13;
the law of Afghanistan. Ifthe CDCs are legally constituted then they are far more likely&#13;
to remain as an active institution far into the future, beyond the perceived timeframe o f&#13;
the NSP itself. This legal status and recognition as an institution of local governance&#13;
would enable the CDCs to seek funding external to the NSP.&#13;
&#13;
The CDCs are intended to be the engines o f development at the village level and the&#13;
CDPs include many activities that fall beyond the mandate o f MRRD. Ifthe CDCs are to&#13;
have an ongoing role, it i s essential that they are properly utilized by other ministries and&#13;
service providers in their activities aimed at the rural population. For the role o f the&#13;
CDCs to be expanded to other ministries, it i s necessary to actively promote the potential&#13;
offered by the CDCs as planning, decision making and service delivery instruments&#13;
across the board.&#13;
&#13;
Currently a draft by-law has been completed incoordinationwith the MRRD,Ministryo f&#13;
Justice and Ministry o f Interior. The by-law has been endorsed by the Inter-Ministerial&#13;
Steering Committee in October, 2006 and is expected to be approved by the President.&#13;
On recommendation o f the Steering Committee, it i s expected that a Presidential Decree&#13;
would be issued to all Government Ministries and agencies clarifying the nature, roles&#13;
and responsibilities o f CDCs and Government's vision towards CDCs.               One o f the&#13;
important expected outcomes o f the decree would be the recognition o f CDCs as formal&#13;
village level bodies that should be considered as the village level interface between the&#13;
Government andcommunities for planning and implementing community based andrural&#13;
development programs. These steps would lay foundation for long term sustainability o f&#13;
CDCs.     However, pending the Presidential approval o f the by-law, the MRRD through&#13;
the community lead development teams based intheir provincial offices will continue to&#13;
provide assistance to the CDCs, who will complete the mobilization cycle o f the ongoing&#13;
NSP, to facilitate the next round o f CDC elections, and assist the CDCs in seeking&#13;
additional finds from other ministries or donors/NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
Sustainabilitv o fthe subproiects&#13;
&#13;
At the level o findividual communities, subprojects sustainability is promotedthrough the&#13;
NSP eligibility rules for subproject proposals, which require a commitment to contribute&#13;
a minimum o f 10 percent o f capital costs and a plan to cover the costs o f operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) o f community assets. Facilitating Partners will help build the&#13;
required technical and financial management capacity in the communities to undertake&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
O&amp;M. Afghan villages have a `traditional' institutional framework for voluntary labor&#13;
mobilization (ashar) to create or maintain joint assets, which can respond to the NSP&#13;
requirements for community contributions towards capital costs andO&amp;M. Inthe case of&#13;
rehabilitation or improvement o f irrigation systems, which comprise a significant share of&#13;
the subprojects, `traditional' non-formal water user associations headed by `water&#13;
masters' (rnirabs) exist throughout Afghanistan (although some have collapsed as a result&#13;
o f conflict and population displacement),       and undertake water distribution and&#13;
maintenance o f local irrigation systems.     Experience from other NGO implemented&#13;
projects inAfghanistan (e.g. drinkingwater supply) have demonstrated that arrangements&#13;
for user payment in cash, kind, or labor for maintenance services provided through the&#13;
market have resulted inhighlevels o f asset sustainability. Inaddition, stringent measures&#13;
have been included in the NSP I1 to improve the quality o f engineering design and&#13;
construction quality o f subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTALAND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS&#13;
&#13;
1. Environmentaland Social Impact Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
Subprojects under the NSP comprise small-scale civil works which during the&#13;
implementation o f the first phase o f the program have not created siggificant negative&#13;
environmental or social impacts. Nevertheless, it is expected that under the NSP I1there&#13;
will be an increase injoint community subprojects which could have potential adverse&#13;
environmental or social impact. Also, poor technical quality o f subprojects and weak,&#13;
incomprehensive social inclusion in the decision making process may cause general&#13;
discontent, and local environmental or safety hazards (see Appendix 8 on technical&#13;
quality o f subprojects).&#13;
&#13;
All activities envisaged under the Grant should not entail significant and negative&#13;
environmental and social impacts, provided that they are designed and implemented with&#13;
due consideration o f environmental and social issues. Rather, most community&#13;
*subprojects have proved duringthe first phase to contribute to improving environmental&#13;
protection and social inclusion inrural areas inAfghanistan. Certain types o f investments&#13;
that carry negative environmental or social impacts will not be undertaken and are&#13;
included ina negative list o fprohibited projects (see "Eligible Subprojects'' section inthe&#13;
NSP Operational Manual).&#13;
&#13;
2. PotentialEnvironmentalImpact&#13;
&#13;
Environmental adverse impacts may arise due to depletion or degradation o f natural&#13;
resources such as stone, earth, water etc. used for the construction o f small-scale&#13;
infrastructure. Constructionactivities may cause limitedtemporary and localized negative&#13;
impacts. They can be mitigated through the implementation o f an appropriate generic&#13;
Environment and Social Management Plan (EMP) to be prepared for joint projects and&#13;
owned by the staff o f the FPs and the communities. This generic EMP could be adjusted&#13;
to the relevant circumstances o f the subprojects and their relevant environment. The NSP&#13;
subprojects can offer a chance to villagers to plan the management o f their natural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
resources and enhance their conservation through a holistic approach to sustainable&#13;
project design and implementation. The FPs will be required to always promote this&#13;
approach and specific information andtraining will be provided.&#13;
&#13;
Rating o f safeguards was unsatisfactory in the last ISR (May 2006). While there is some&#13;
experience in dealing with negative impacts and mitigation measures for NSP&#13;
subprojects, screening for potential environmental and social impacts on a subproject-by-&#13;
subproject basis will be introduced inthe operational manual. Subprojects may be located&#13;
insensitive andfragile ecosystems requiring special attentionandprecautions. Screening&#13;
through a proper check list would help the NSP team to flag flaws in the design and&#13;
preparation phase, and to carry out further assessment with consulting the relevant&#13;
specialists if needed. Rural roads, groundwater withdrawal, diversion works for water,&#13;
construction activities are all example o f subprojects that will require special attention in&#13;
understanding their impacts. FPs will be responsible for ensuring that potential impacts o f&#13;
are identified, and mitigation measures planned, implemented and monitored.&#13;
Additionally, an independent assessment o f potential cumulative impacts o f the NSP&#13;
portfolio will be carried out duringthe implementation.&#13;
&#13;
3. Land Acquisition&#13;
&#13;
Under any condition, the NSP will not allow involuntary land acquisition and forced&#13;
(involuntary) resettlement caused by acquisition o f land or other property for&#13;
implementation o f the subproject.&#13;
&#13;
If a minor plot of land is needed for a subproject, land can only be obtained through&#13;
private voluntary donation, purchase by the community (a transaction between a willing&#13;
buyer and a willing seller), or from available government land. Private voluntary&#13;
donation or community purchase must be documented and an agreement signed; refer to&#13;
Safeguard Forms 2 and 3 in Annex 5 o f the Operational Manual attached). It is worth&#13;
bringingto attention, once again, that the NSP does not allow, under any circumstance,&#13;
the use o f block grant and community contribution (the minimum 10 percent) for&#13;
purchasing o f land; plot/s o f land for implementation o f subprojects must be purchased&#13;
with additional funds made availablebythe community.&#13;
&#13;
4. MinorityGroups&#13;
&#13;
The design for the project defines a strategy, which ensures that ethnic minority groups&#13;
are included as beneficiaries, and that their concerns are addressed. The NSP promotes&#13;
equity and full inclusion o f ethnic/tribal minority groups. The procedure for the election&#13;
o f CDC representatives, by which each households cluster elects two representatives&#13;
(male and female), ensures that minority groups are represented in the CDC. The&#13;
Community Profile (Disbursement Form 1 NSP OM Annex 1) provides the baseline&#13;
information on minority groups, which can be compared with the CDC Election and&#13;
Composition Form (Disbursement Form 2, NSP OM Annex 1) and Subproject Proposal&#13;
(Disbursement Form 7, NSP OM Annex 1) to assess the extent to which ethnidtribal&#13;
minority groups participate inthe CDC andbenefit from subprojects. Moreover:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   0    the project is national in scale and coverage, and consequently reaches all the&#13;
        country's different ethnic groups&#13;
&#13;
   0    both internal monitoring and external independent evaluation will assess the&#13;
        inclusiveness o f CDCs and thus provide information that would constitute the&#13;
        basis for corrective actions, ifnecessary&#13;
&#13;
   0    independent monitoring by civil society (NGOs and the press) will provide&#13;
        another mechanism to identify cases where ethnic minority groups would have&#13;
        been bypassed or marginalized.&#13;
&#13;
5. CulturalProperty&#13;
&#13;
Duringproject implementation the community may encounter cultural property, defined&#13;
as sites and structures (monuments, works o f art, grave sites) having religious, historical,&#13;
architectural, archaeological, or paleonthological significance, and natural sites o f&#13;
particularbeauty andor special cultural value.&#13;
&#13;
Small-scale infrastructure subprojects are unlikely to pose threat o f damaging these sites.&#13;
However, excavations may lead to chance finds, therefore procedures are to be put in&#13;
place and followed to assist identification and protection. Chance find procedures are&#13;
defined in the law on Maintenance o f Historical and Cultural Monuments (Official&#13;
Gazette, December 21, 1980), which decrees that all moveable and immovable historical&#13;
andcultural artifacts are property o fthe State, and further:&#13;
&#13;
    0   The responsibility for preservation, maintenance, and assessment o f historical and&#13;
        cultural monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministry&#13;
        o f Information and Culture, which has representation at the provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Ifamoveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact is found, the provincial&#13;
        governor (wali) or district-in-charge (colossal) should be informed within two&#13;
        weeks, andthey should inform the Archaeological Committee.&#13;
        Incase of a chance find of moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact,&#13;
        the executing agency (MRRD) i s responsible for protecting the artifact from theft,&#13;
        pilferage and damage untilresponsibility i s taken over by the competent authority&#13;
        specified above.&#13;
&#13;
    0   These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction&#13;
        subcontracts, when applicable.&#13;
&#13;
6. PoppyCultivation&#13;
&#13;
Any activity that supports drug cultivation and processing is on the NSP Negative List&#13;
(NSP OM, section 1). The activity, most likely to support poppy cultivation, is irrigation&#13;
rehabilitation and development in poppy-producing regions. If a CDC in a poppy-&#13;
producing area proposes an irrigation subproject, the optiodrisk that the water i s used for&#13;
poppy cultivation must be discussed, and the CDC must confirm that drug crop&#13;
cultivation will not take place in the area benefiting from the project. This agreement&#13;
must be documented inthe Tripartite Agreement (Disbursement Form 8) and Subproject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Proposal (Disbursement Form 7) as per annex 1o f the NSP OM.&#13;
&#13;
7. LandMine RiskManagement&#13;
&#13;
The following procedures serve to minimize the risk posed by land mines during the&#13;
implementationo fthe subproject:&#13;
&#13;
        Communities are required to complete a questionnaire regarding the potential&#13;
        presence o fmines inthe proposedsubproject site; refer to NSP OM annex 1. Only&#13;
        subproject sites assessed to have a nil-to-low risk, based on reliable information,&#13;
        are eligible.&#13;
&#13;
    0   The Tripartite Agreement makes clear that the community is solely liable in case&#13;
        o f a mine-related accident; refer to Tripartite Agreement, NSP OM annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Ifsignificant mine risk is present or existing mine data is outdated or otherwise&#13;
        unreliable, the subproject will not be approved, unless the community has&#13;
        included provisions for mine assessment/clearance in the subproject proposal.&#13;
        Mine assessment and clearance tasks must be implementedby UN-MACA or by a&#13;
        mine action organization accredited by UN-MACA. Communities will be&#13;
        penalized if they clear mines on their own (subsequent NSP funding will be&#13;
        reduced or cancelled).&#13;
&#13;
8. Safeguards Management Performance and follow up&#13;
&#13;
During NSP Isupervisions, concerns were raised about unsatisfactory monitoring o f&#13;
safeguards, particularly o f safeguards compliance related to land acquisition. In spite o f&#13;
the instructions inthe OM and the guidelines in the ESMF, there i s neither indication o f&#13;
systematic monitoring nor proper documentation o f Land Acquisition at MRRD/NSP&#13;
management level. MRRD/NSP Management will aim at ensuring, through specific&#13;
mobilization o f FPs, that proper procedures be followed, including the requirements for&#13;
full documentation o f the voluntary nature o f land donation and the subsequent&#13;
community ownership status o f the land in question. This issue becomes even more&#13;
critical inview o fthe increasingnumber o fjoint projects, thus larger subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition, a qualified safeguard specialist willbehiredbyeffectiveness to act as a focal&#13;
officer to ensure compliance, adequate monitoring, and proper training to the FPs. TORS&#13;
for the position have been agreed at the appraisal.&#13;

&#13;
1. Background&#13;
&#13;
The NSP I1cost i s estimated at US$525.7 million for the period between 2006 and 2009.&#13;
Expected project targets include: (i)expanding the coverage o f the on-going NSP to new&#13;
areas in order to lay the foundations for a strengthening o f community level governance,&#13;
and (ii)to support community-managed subprojects comprising reconstruction and&#13;
development that improve access o f rural communities to social and productive&#13;
infrastructure and services. By completing a first round o f Block Grants to the 17,600&#13;
villages mobilized by NSP Iand reaching out to additional 4,300 new villages, the&#13;
project's outcomes will be (i) the nation wide establishment o f a framework for village&#13;
level consultative decision making and representative local leadership as a basis for&#13;
interactionwithin andbetween communities on the one hand, andwith the administration&#13;
and aid agencies on the other; and (ii)local level reconstruction, development, and&#13;
capacitybuilding(humanand social) which will leadto poverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Methodology&#13;
&#13;
Efficiency was addressed fiom two perspectives: (i)     absolute efficiency at the level of&#13;
individual subprojects through economic rates o f return (ERRS)and net present value&#13;
(NPV)calculations, andits expansion to the overallprogramto be financed underNSP 11;&#13;
and (ii) comparative efficiency (cost-efficiency) by comparing the cost o f undertaking&#13;
typical public investments through the NSP approach versus achieving the same results&#13;
through alternative government's approaches or programs. The overall NSP ERR resulted&#13;
from the weighted average rate o freturn generated by a sample o ftypical subprojects. By&#13;
usingNSP Icompleted typical subprojects as representative for NSP I1investments, all&#13;
costs and most benefits o f the expected demand driven investments are either known or&#13;
could be estimated more accurately. Cost efficiency indicators were estimated at two&#13;
levels: (i) block grant delivery costs for the government (including MRRD, OC and&#13;
           the&#13;
FPs in NSP I); and (ii) cost comparison o f typical investments in NSP Iat the&#13;
                           the&#13;
community level, with alternative modalities in delivering the same public or productive&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
The economic and financial analyses aimed to determine: (i)whether the proposed&#13;
investments would result in poverty reduction (financial perspective measured through&#13;
increased family income and/or reduced costs involved inthe community access to basic&#13;
services and infrastructure); and (ii) whether there would be a positive net economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            40&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
impact from the social (economic) perspective.&#13;
&#13;
FAR MOD^ software was used to build the two scenarios from which incremental cost&#13;
and benefits were estimated for each community: the without NSP I1 scenario which&#13;
represent the existing situation; and the with NSP II scenario, where the project&#13;
investments would allow for enhanced access to basic public goods and/or productive&#13;
infrastructure. Data were derived from a sample o f 22 NSP Icompleted subprojects in&#13;
Kabul, Khost and Logar Provinces. Data were collected through several visits to the&#13;
representative NSP Icommunities - five to six subprojects for each o f the four types o f&#13;
most demanded investments: (i)        access rural roads and improved related structures; (ii)&#13;
electrification; (iii) supply; and (iv) rehabilitation or improvement o f damaged&#13;
                       water&#13;
irrigation structures. The information was later verified by subsequent visits by MRRD&#13;
andBankrepresentatives to some o fthe sampled communities.&#13;
&#13;
After validation, the data was introduced to FARMOD to estimate the corresponding&#13;
indicators (financial benefits per community, and ERRSandNPVs for subprojects andthe&#13;
overall NSP). FARMOD output shows results at four levels and the two perspectives&#13;
(financial and economic): (i)    at the community level; (ii) subproject level; (iii) each&#13;

o f the four types o f investment level; and (iv) at the overall NSP level. The financial&#13;
analysis aims at determining the poverty alleviation impact at the target group resulting&#13;
from the demand driven proposed community investments and/or improvements,&#13;
independently o f parallel fiscal costs for the country. The economic analysis i s aimed at&#13;
testing the viability o f the project from the country's economy as a whole, including all&#13;
delivery costs not bared bythe beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
Cost information for the cost efficiency analysis was obtained through interviews with&#13;
qualified informants and through the revision o f several Bank and other sources' reports.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
The ERR for the NSP was estimated at 38.2% and the NPV at US$1.186 million,&#13;
assuming that 30 percent o f the NSP I1subprojects could fail because o f poor design or&#13;
growing conflicting situations in high risk areas. It was also assumed that NSP I1block&#13;
grant funds would maintain the same distribution between the type o f subproject as in&#13;
NSP I,and that the average costs and benefits of the subprojects would be similar as&#13;
those in Phase I.N o value was assigned to the strengthening o f governance in&#13;
Afghanistan being achieved through NSP, which is however likely to be the most&#13;
important impact o f the program. Neither the benefits expected to be generated by the&#13;
 follow-up projects implementedby the CDCs created under the NSP inspite o f its impact&#13;
on humanand social capital formation.&#13;
&#13;
FinancialAnalysis.Most beneficiariesobtain significant financial results. It is expressed&#13;
both by the overall program's financial rate o f return o f 93.7 percent, and by the family&#13;
income increments and/or cost savings intheir daily lives. Villages under NSP facilitation&#13;

 approach usually select the most urgent service and/or infrastructure for meeting their&#13;
 needs. Table 2 shows that from the 17,026 funded subprojects (as o f August 30, 2006),&#13;
 about 26.1 percent focused on supplying drinking water; 21.4 percent in improving&#13;
 transport infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc.); 18.6 percent in the rehabilitation o f&#13;
 irrigation systems; 15 percent in the provision o f energy (generators, micro-hydro, solar&#13;
 energy); 10.3 percent inimproving their livelihood and generation o f income; 6.9 percent&#13;
 ineducation infrastructure; and 1.2percent inother investments.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  However, when ordered according to the amounts o f block grants disbursed and&#13;
  committed, the transport investment group takes the lead with 26 percent due to their&#13;
  higher costs, followed by water supply (23.8 percent), power (21.5 percent), and&#13;
  irrigation (18.1 percent). These sectors account for almost 90 percent o f the total&#13;
  disbursement and h dcommitments.&#13;
&#13;
  For a rapid assessment o f the on-going 17,026 subprojects, 22 cases were selected&#13;
  covering the four most important groups o f subprojects (transport, water supply, power&#13;
  and irrigation). The selection was done considering mainly the list o f first completed&#13;
  2,544 subprojects which was 15 percent o f the NSP financed subprojects. Their&#13;
  representative nature, as well as security and accessibility concerns were the central&#13;
  criteria for the selection. For each o f these 22 study cases, costs and benefits were&#13;
  estimated, andvisits to the villages for the impact assessment were made.&#13;
&#13;
  Subproject costs were estimated based on: (i)   actual block grant disbursements; and (ii)&#13;
  the expected NSP overheads (facilitation and other delivery project costs). Benefit&#13;
  estimations were derived by interviewing the respective community and considering their&#13;
  assessmentabout actual results.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
 CDCs facilitation, project preparation and capacity building costs under NSP IIare&#13;
 expected to have an average cost o fUS$8,400 per village, to be spent ina two year cycle.&#13;
 However, a more conservative amount o f US$9,800 per village in a three year cycle,&#13;
 which corresponds to the average cost under NSP                 I ' O ,was used for the evaluation.&#13;
 Similarly, MRRD/OC costs per village were estimated at US$3,528for the three year&#13;
 cycle.&#13;
&#13;
 Some villages use the assigned block grant for 1, 2 or 3 subprojects (average o f 1.8&#13;
 subprojects per village). MRRD/OC overheads and FP facilitating costs per subproject&#13;
 were considered proportionally by the ratio between the respective subproject cost' and&#13;
 the block grant amount assigned. Each CDC is entitled to receive a Block Grant amount&#13;
 o f US$200 per family in the community, up to a maximum of US$60,000. Costs and&#13;
 benefit value estimates and the main indicators for the 22 subprojects are summarized in&#13;
 the tables at the end o f this Appendix.&#13;
&#13;
 Economic Analysis. The overall NSP ERRwas estimated at 38.2 percent andthe NPV at&#13;
 US$1.186 million. Main assumptions were: (i)               30 percent o f the NSP I1 subprojects&#13;
 would fail because o f poor design or increased conflicting situations in high risk areas;&#13;
 (ii) I1blockgrantfunds wouldbedemandedmaintainingthe samedistribution&#13;
      NSP&#13;
 between types o f subproject as in NSP I;and (iii)            subprojects would have similar costs&#13;
 and benefits as those shown in NSP I.N o value was assigned to the improvement o f&#13;
 governance, nor to the benefits expected to be generated by the follow-up projects that&#13;
 the program created CDCs are already implementing&#13;
&#13;
 Table 3 below shows the weighted average economic rate o f returns (ERRS)for the four&#13;
 groups o f subprojects, based on the 22 case studies sample (including five to six&#13;
 subprojects ineach type o f investment) financed by the NSP Iblock grants. Most tradable&#13;
 input andproduct economic prices were assumed to be equivalent to their market prices.&#13;
 A shadow price o f 0.7 was applied for labor costs, given the high underemployment&#13;
  levels in rural areas. All prices are assumed to remain constant in real terms throughout&#13;
 the life o f the project. The aggregation o f subprojects, including the about 21,600&#13;
  communities to be benefited by the NSP Iand 11, shows that the project is having a&#13;
  significant impact for the Afghan economy even assuming that 30 percent o f the&#13;
  subprojects in all four categories could fail as a result o f poor design and/or the risks o f&#13;
 persistent and even growing violence.&#13;

  10Facilitation costs are expected to be reduced by 10-12%as compared with what was the case inNSP I,&#13;
 based on the experience gained bothby the FPs and the MRRD/OC implementationteams.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The high ERRs are due to the fact that CDCs usually develop their Community&#13;
Development Plans (CDPs) with the participation o f the whole community, and the&#13;
selection o f those subprojects most needed. After decades o f economic stagnation,&#13;
population booms, pervasive inequality and injustice, and several armed conflicts, with&#13;
the unprecedented NSP governmental support, largely unsatisfied basic needs are&#13;
beginning to be covered, and new economic activities are being made possible. Some&#13;
examples o f the benefits are: (i)      the supply o f safe water reduces the amount o f time&#13;
previously required to convey water for each family, and the cost o f medical treatments&#13;
for waterborne diseases; and labor i s released for more productive activities; (ii)                the&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement o f damaged irrigation structures increases water&#13;
availability for irrigation, agriculture and livestock production; (iii)           the rural roads and&#13;
connecting structures enhances access to previously isolated villages, and facilitate -&#13;
within other things - carrying their products to reach the nearest markets; (iv) having&#13;
electricity reduces the cost o f lamps and other devices, allowing to have machines to&#13;
introduce livelihood activities, basic appliances, TV sets, PCs, etc.; (v) school&#13;
construction improves or creates educationpossibilities for children and adults, where 70&#13;
percent o f the population i s illiterate. Since communities know exactly were their major&#13;
needs are, inmost cases highERRs are almost guarantied.&#13;
&#13;
The water supply subprojects show the highest ERRs with an average 60.8 percent&#13;
mainly from time and costs saved by family members for collecting andor obtaining&#13;
water. Safe drinking water has also important implications for health and productivity o f&#13;
the population and thereby for economic growth. Only 13 percent o f population has&#13;
access to safe water, and only 12percent to adequate sanitation". Very longjourneys had&#13;
to be made by every family to collect potable water and much o f the burden for this task&#13;
falls on women and children's hands. The negative impact this had on pre-project local&#13;
productivity was substantial, since less time was left for productive activities such as&#13;
takingcare o fgardenvegetable crops, orchards and livestock; and for children, going late&#13;
to school or missing it altogether. Time savings were transformed to 'work days saved'&#13;
which have an opportunity cost represented bywhat is paid for labor work inthe region.&#13;
&#13;
Access roads and accessory projects show an average ERR o f 26.6 percent. The five&#13;
cases analyzed in this group showed FRRs between 5.9 percent and 80 percent. Benefits&#13;
result again from time savings and from significant increases in agricultural products and&#13;
sales, made possible by these investments. They have a significant impact by facilitating&#13;
the transportation o f local products at lower cost, opening also market opportunities that&#13;
were previously unreachable, as harvesting and transport costs exceeded, most o f the&#13;
time, the price in the market. Products previously left on the trees are now being&#13;
marketed inincreased volumes.&#13;
&#13;
Energy subprojects average ERRs at 26.3 percent. Individual FRR show a range varying&#13;
from 2.9 percent in the case o f a small village o f 137 families (Shir Ahmad Khan in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l1The progressive deteriorationof sector services since 1998 is evident inthat 40% ofthe urbanpopulation&#13;
had access to water and sanitationin 1998, a percentage which dropped to 20-25% the following year, and&#13;
further deteriorated in2000-2001, As ameasure ofcomparison, the % ofthe populationwith access to safe&#13;
water and improved sanitation i s 88% and 61% inPakistan, 75% and 38% inChina, 84% and 28% inIndia,&#13;
and 100%for both inSignapore.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Khost, Mandozai) and 70.5 percent in a community o f 296 families (Mohamood Agha,&#13;
Nassir Khel, Logar). Benefits are mainly derived from fuel and gas saved from using&#13;
small family generators and lamps, against the subprojects' unified diesel, micro hydro&#13;
power or solar generators and distribution systems servicing the community. Other non-&#13;
quantified benefits include access to domestic appliances, TV sets, computers, and even&#13;
small income generating equipment like sewing machines.&#13;
&#13;
The irrigation projects show an ERR averaging 38.5 percent. Inthe case o f a community&#13;
growing grapes in Nasiree Village, Kabul, yields were doubled as more water for&#13;
irrigating was available at a much lower costs (cost for pumping halfed in the first year&#13;
after rehabilitation). However, for this assessment, only 50 percent o f the increase in&#13;
yields was considered given that the winter season provided more than usual snow and&#13;
water. The FRR in this case was 138.5 percent, while in the other four schemes, it was&#13;
estimated to be between 10.3 percent and 58.3 percent. In general, irrigation works in&#13;
their first season after rehabilitation only show small increases in cultivated areas and&#13;
productivity. As water management improves during the subsequent years due to more&#13;
adequate timely watering, villagers beginto grow two crops per year instead o f one and&#13;
production increases as more low-cost water becomes available. Additionally, they begin&#13;
to introduce higher value crops which further increases family incomes as new marketing&#13;
opportunities are identify.&#13;
&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis. The sensitivity o f the program to the major risk facing the country&#13;
was also tested. The on-going armed conflict could result in further aggravation o f the&#13;
security situation in rural villages increasing the risk o f subproject sustainability. Inthe&#13;
case subprojects failure would reach 50 percent instead o f the assumed 30 percent, the&#13;
ERRcould fall from 38.2 percent to 27 percent. Bythe contrary, ifthe situationimproves&#13;
and scheme failures drop to only 15 percent, the ERRcould be increased to 46.4 percent.&#13;
These results allow concluding that the NSP I1has very low probability o f failure. ON the&#13;
contrary, the NSP I1has a very strong probability to continue to be the most effective&#13;
vehicle for the country's post-war rural reconstruction and for the strengthening o f local&#13;
governance, as i s being confirmed by several external evaluations o f the NSP so far.&#13;
&#13;
4. Cost Efficiency Analysis&#13;
&#13;
A cost efficiency analysis was also conducted at two levels: (i) block grant delivery&#13;
                                                                    the&#13;
costs (including MRRD, Oversight Consultants and FPs) as compared with international&#13;
experience; and (ii)the cost comparison o f typical block grant investments at the&#13;
community level, with other modalities o f investments for delivering the same services in&#13;
Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
NSP Delivery Costs. At the end o f NSP IIthe investment costs (including both NSP I&#13;
and 11) would be about US$750 million (excluding the School Windows and AIRD&#13;
components). Delivery costs would be US$214 million (US$ 64 million correspondingto&#13;
MRRDandOC management costs andUS$l50to the facilitation costs through the FPs).&#13;
Delivery and community development costs would represent about 28.5 percent o f the&#13;
total program costs. Delivery costs were 61.5 percent percent inNSP Ifirst year (1382),&#13;
as a consequence o f the slow initiation o f activities and community mobilization process,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
but as BGare disbursed inthe second andthirdcycle o f facilitation, delivery costs reduce&#13;
its share in total costs. However, delivery costs could rapidly increase if funds for&#13;
disbursingblock grants were not be available to meet the demand, as was the case lately&#13;
inthe NSP I. year 1384, as a consequence o f lack of liquidityof the program (inits&#13;
               In&#13;
third year o f implementation), block grants disbursements was delayed for several&#13;
months while maintaining fixed and expensive administration and facilitation resources&#13;
idle.&#13;
&#13;
Cost-Efficiency &amp; Delivery Costs of Alternative NSP I1 Designs. For all analyzed&#13;
sectors, the delivery costs o f NSP have resulted cost effective. To measure the cost-&#13;
efficiency o f the NSP in terms o f delivering the interim Afghanistan National&#13;
Development Strategy (I-ANDs) targets and other service infrastructures, a comparison&#13;
exercise was carried out using average costs made available by line Ministries and their&#13;
program offices. The analysis included the 5 sectors which account for 96 percent o fNSP&#13;
BG investments: Water &amp; Sanitation, Transportation, Power, Irrigation and Education.&#13;
By comparing the unit cost for achieving I-ANDs targets by infrastructure provision by&#13;
NSP versus other means o f providing that infrastructure, it has been found that NSP I1&#13;
offers substantial cost savings. These savings are about 31 percent in weighted average,&#13;
since alternative ways o f buildingthis infrastructure was estimated to be 45 percent more&#13;
expensive, as shown inthe following Table 4.&#13;

&#13;
By completing the expansion to 90 percent o f all rural villages, NSP would mark a&#13;
significant advance on the achievement o f I-ANDs objectives. NSP has proved to be a&#13;
key vehicle inthe delivery o f the planned benchmarks, particularly inthe areas o f rural&#13;
infrastructure and community development. Worldwide Bank experience shows that&#13;
government costs o f introducing a community-based development or demand driven&#13;
(CBDKDD) approach has been substantial, but the actual costs to the government for&#13;
building social infrastructure have been significantly lower in CBDKDD interventions,&#13;
as communities bear a considerable part o f the cost o f the service delivery infrastructure.&#13;
A Bank recent self-evaluation o f social funds in six countries (2003) noted that&#13;
community management o f investments provides a significant opportunity for cost&#13;
savings o f as much as 25-50 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
5.     Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
The economic analysis o f the NSP I1 confirms that the NSP is having a solid and&#13;
sustainable financial impact on beneficiaries, with a parallel ERR o f about 38.2 percent,&#13;
even when 30 percent o f the schemes are assumed to fail, and only some o f the benefits&#13;
are quantified against all project costs. NSP non-quantified most important impact is&#13;
expected to relay in its contribution for building governance throughout Afghanistan.&#13;
Delivery costs are in line with international standards and the CBD/CDD approach is&#13;
creating the foundations for other development projects to build over the local human,&#13;
social and institutional capital being developed. The strengthening o f the financial&#13;
situation o f beneficiaries, the employment generation, and the women participation inthe&#13;
process are also significant contributions for poverty alleviation.&#13;

          APPENDIX 4: IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
A weak Government's civil service infrastructure, particularly at provincial and district&#13;
levels, and disrupted village level social and community level organizations characterized&#13;
the start up o fthe implementationo fNSP in2003. At that time there was an acute shortage&#13;
o f national staff and the available staff lacked skills and exposure to planning and&#13;
implementation o f rural development programs. The Ministry o f Rural Rehabilitation and&#13;
Development (MRRD), which was the anchor ministry o f the NSP, lacked operational,&#13;
procurement and financial management procedures and guidelines required to plan and&#13;
implement a nation wide community driven development program such as NSP. The&#13;
communication infrastructure was limited, with no regular surface mail service between&#13;
Kabul andprovinces.&#13;
&#13;
Because o f this situation, during the first three years of implementation o f the NSP the&#13;
MRRDhas been assisted by an internationally recruitedOversight Consultant to carry out&#13;
the overall management o f the program. In addition, the facilitation o f and technical&#13;
guidance for the village level project planning and implementation have been outsourced to&#13;
24 international and national NGOs, called facilitating partners (FPs).          These FPs&#13;
facilitated the mobilization o f the target communities to form democratically elected&#13;
Community Development Councils (CDCs) and provided technical guidance to the CDCs&#13;
for the management o f block grants and planning and implementation o f the subprojects at&#13;
village level usingthe block grants.&#13;
&#13;
The program was initially managed through a centralized system based in Kabul, due to&#13;
the lack o f capacity at the provincial level. However, during the course o f the last two&#13;
years five regional offices have been established, and regional and provincial management&#13;
capacity has been slowly but gradually developed and strengthened, and decentralization o f&#13;
project oversight has been gradually delegated to regional and provincial offices. The&#13;
responsibilities for training and engineering support to FPs and CDCs have devolved to&#13;
regional offices.&#13;
&#13;
Most MRRD civil servants at the central and provincial levels have been integrated into&#13;
the NSP management structure over the past three years. Two MRRD staff from every&#13;
province have been seconded to the provincial NSP OC offices to provide additional&#13;
engineering and monitoring support, as well as to learn the intricacies o f the program's&#13;
processes andprocedures. The MRRD staff at the central level has been integrated across&#13;
all program departments o f the OC to be a part o f the implementation and to learnhow the&#13;
program operates. The OC has supported all o f these integrated staff with specific but&#13;
limitedcapacity buildingtraining, as well as on-the-job mentoring.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the public administration, staffing, skills, security and logistical constraints that&#13;
prevailed in the country, these implementation arrangements have resulted in a rapid roll&#13;
out o f the program covering nearly two thirds o f the rural villages o f the country to date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              54&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The NSP i s now recognized by the government, rural communities as well as the&#13;
international donor cpmmunity as a successhl community-driven,                 village-level&#13;
infrastructure delivery, and institution buildingprogram.&#13;
&#13;
However, these arrangements have also been subject o f criticism. It has been often noted&#13;
that: the NSP reliance on the external oversight consultant has prevented capacity building&#13;
o f the MRRD; the Technical Assistance cost was high; there was no clear separation o f&#13;
core policy, donor coordination, external relations, fund raising and budget control&#13;
functions o f the MRRD from the management oversight and operational responsibilities o f&#13;
the OC; intra-ministerial coordination between the ongoing rural development programs&#13;
within the MRRD was seen as ineffective; and collaboration and coordination o f the NSP&#13;
with other ministries which are mandated for implementing various other complementary&#13;
rural development programs have been weak at central, provincial anddistrict levels.&#13;
&#13;
Taking into account these lessons and the challenges and constraints that continue to be&#13;
posed by the operating environment, the NSP I1institutional arrangements build on the&#13;
successful elements o f the existing structure, but they also introduce significant&#13;
adjustments, with a special attention to the institutional strengthening of the MRRD and&#13;
the decentralization o fthe program.&#13;
&#13;
2. InstitutionalArrangementsfor the NSPI1&#13;
&#13;
The implementing arrangement over the next three years will rely upon the regional and&#13;
provincial office structure as was in the ongoing program, but it is proposed to have a&#13;
rather autonomous structure within the MRRD as opposed to the OC led implementation&#13;
structure o fthe ongoing program.&#13;
&#13;
The NSP I1management will continue to be supported by a reduced level o f international&#13;
technical assistance, while the MRRD will lead andprovide the oversight for the program.&#13;
Unlike in the first phase, inthe NSP I1the MRRD will carry out core functions such as&#13;
policy and strategy development and application, coordination with other ministries,&#13;
resource mobilization, management o f relations with FPs, appraisal, approval and&#13;
processing o f subprojects, engineering, monitoring and quality assurance - focusing on&#13;
achievements, outcomes and program impact, and training and capacity development at&#13;
central andregional levels.&#13;
&#13;
Other functions, such as consolidated financial management, Block Grant Management&#13;
and Management Information System (MIS) operations will be outsourced to an external&#13;
consultant. All remaining operational functions (including M&amp;E, HRD, Procurement,&#13;
General Administration, Public Communications, FP Management, and Technical Support)&#13;
will be handled directly by MRRD NSP staff with limited technical assistance from&#13;
international consultants. These MRRD staff, however, will be contracted staff and not&#13;
MRRDcivil servants as there is still an acute shortage ofregular civil servants within the&#13;
MRRD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               55&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The staff o fthe outsourced departments (Financial Management, Block Grant Management&#13;
and MIS) will remain employees o f the consultant while all national staff o f the other&#13;
departments will be contracted directly byNSP.&#13;
&#13;
OverallProjectPlanning,ExecutionandOversight&#13;
&#13;
The MRRD will be responsible for the overall planning, execution, oversight and&#13;
monitoring o f the NSP 11. The MRRD will be guided by an inter-ministerial steering&#13;
committee for the overall policy, strategic planning and management o f the project and for&#13;
integration o f NSP I1 with other complementary rural development programs, This&#13;
Committee will be chaired by the Second Vice President o f the Government and i s&#13;
represented by the Ministers o f Finance, Agriculture and Irrigation, Energy and Water,&#13;
Education, Public Health, Women's Affairs, Public Works, and Rural Rehabilitation and&#13;
Development. The Ministries o f Justice and Interior Affairs will be invited to attend the&#13;
Steering Committee on need basis. The Minister RRD will act as the Secretary and&#13;
Convener o f the Committee. This Committee has already been established and will meet&#13;
once in every three months. Terms o f Reference o f the Committee are expected to be&#13;
approved by the Committee before Grant effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
The Minister o f Rural Rehabilitation and Development, with assistance from the Deputy&#13;
Minister o f Programs, will be accountable to the national steering committee for the&#13;
overall management o f the program aligned with the government policy and rural&#13;
development objectives and goals. In addition the Minister is accountable to Ministry o f&#13;
Finance for diligent and efficient planning, budgeting and utilization o f funds allocated to&#13;
the project by the IDA and various donors within the provisions o f the Grant Agreements&#13;
signed between the Government and the donors, including the International Development&#13;
Association (IDA). The Minister will also ensure that the NSP I1will be planned and&#13;
executed for contributing toward the achievement o f the Government's rural development&#13;
benchmarks for the period 2006-2010 as indicated in the Interim Afghanistan National&#13;
Development Strategy (I-ANDS).&#13;
&#13;
An external donor committee, consisting with IDA and other donors financing the NSP 11,&#13;
will monitor the overall program planning and implementation and its development&#13;
outcomes through close liaison with the Minister. Inaddition, the Task Team o f the World&#13;
Bank, on behalf o f the contributing donors, will provide fiduciary oversight and technical&#13;
guidance to the program through regular implementation reviews in close collaboration&#13;
with the donors and the MRRD.&#13;
&#13;
The program will be managed by Management Units established at the central and&#13;
provincial levels. At the center, the Minister will be assisted by a Executive Director. The&#13;
Executive Director will be responsible for policy formulation, strategic planning, external&#13;
and donor relations, budget and fund management and overall oversight with support o f a&#13;
small cadre o f support staff. The Executive Director will be assisted by a Director o f&#13;
Operations.    The Executive Director, with the operational assistance from the Director o f&#13;
Operations, will oversee, guide and monitor the overall project execution with the&#13;
assistance from a number o f operational sub-units located within the MRRD. The Director&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             56&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o f Operations will be responsible for operational planning, guiding and overseeing the&#13;
Management Support Consultant (see later for details), Technical Assistance Units and&#13;
Field Operations at MRRD Regional and Provincial Offices on day to day basis. The&#13;
Executive Director will be a senior and experienced Afghan national appointed by the&#13;
MRRD within the existing government civil service or selected through a competitive&#13;
process. The Director o f Operations will be an experienced and competent international&#13;
consultant who will bringinternational experience inthe planningand execution o f similar&#13;
community driven development programs. H e will be hired directly bythe MRRD.&#13;
&#13;
A number o f subunits at the NSP unit o f the MRRD will assist the Executive Director in&#13;
the planning, execution and monitoring the program. These sub-units will be staffed by&#13;
national staff as well as long term and short-term international staff. Inthe initial year, the&#13;
respective international staff will head the sub-unit with a senior subject matter national&#13;
specialist as the deputy. The deputy heads o f the units will be coached andmentoredby the&#13;
international staff. From the second year onwards, the deputies will head the unit. These&#13;
sub-units will be responsible for Financial and Block Grant Management, Management&#13;
Information System; M&amp;E; Human Resources Development; Engineering; Procurement;&#13;
FacilitatingPartner Management; Administration; andPublic Communication. Inaddition,&#13;
an independent Controller's unit will be responsible for processing and addressing&#13;
complaints from CDCs and carrying out internal and external technical and financial audit&#13;
o f the program.&#13;
&#13;
ManagementSupportConsultant(MSC)&#13;
&#13;
The present Oversight Consultant will begin to phase out starting in September 2006, with&#13;
a transitional period on a reduced scope o f services until the end o f March 2007. The&#13;
transfer o f responsibility to the NSP Central andProvincial Management Units will start in&#13;
September. The MSC will replace the present OC from April 2007. The selection o f the&#13;
M S C i s underway. The MSC will be outsourced with the responsibility for Financial&#13;
Management,       Block Grant Management and Management                Information System&#13;
Management. Inaddition, the MSC firm will provide the services o f the international staff&#13;
required for the Technical Assistance Units on full or part time basis.&#13;
&#13;
Outsourcing financial management i s intended to ensure accountability and transparency to&#13;

Project implementation and oversight at provincial and field level&#13;
&#13;
Seven Regional RRD Offices (five established under the NSP and two new to be established&#13;
under NSP 11) will oversee the planning and implementation o f the project activities at&#13;
provincial and field level.       These Regional Offices have been established as a means o f&#13;
decentralization for increased efficiency in program implementation and operational issues&#13;
such as supervision o f provincial offices, training, non-engineering proposals, FP contract&#13;
monitoring, etc. The Regional offices will continue to function and play a vital role in the&#13;
smooth h c t i o n i n g o f the NSP. Each RO office will be headed by a regional manager and&#13;
consist o f a small cadre o f staff required to carry out its responsibilities. The regional offices&#13;
will maintainclose collaborationwith the NSP main office inKabul andthe regionalmanagers&#13;
will receive guidance from the Director of Operations and report directly to the Executive&#13;
Director through the Director o f Operations. The regional offices provide the support to the&#13;
provincial offices in approving block grants, liaison with FPs, overseeing the procurement&#13;
administration o f subprojects and build local management capacities o f the provincial staff&#13;
through on-the-job training.&#13;
&#13;
Currently the provincial RRD offices have also specific NSP-related finctions such as the&#13;
relations with CDCs, approval and implementation monitoring o f subprojects, in some cases&#13;
duplicating the functions o f the FPs. Inthe NSP I1this parallel OC provincial offices will be&#13;
gradually merged to become one NSP RDD Provincial Management Unit. Core OC staff&#13;
currently working at the regional and provincial levels will be integrated into these RRD&#13;
offices in a phased manner, initially as contracted staff to ensure that the experienced OC staff&#13;
who have benefited from a sizeable investment in their capacity development will be&#13;
effectively used for the NSP I1 implementation. At the regional and provincial levels, all&#13;
positions will beNSP staff contracted to MRRD.&#13;
&#13;
The Provincial RRD offices will be responsible for overseeing the work o f the FPs and for&#13;
managing the outcome o f the NSP: the mobilization o f the communities, formation o f the&#13;
CDCs and planning and implementation o f the subprojects. The provincial offices will house&#13;
engineering staff as well as Community Lead Development Teams. The engineering staff will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be responsible for engineering review and supervision o f subprojects while the Community&#13;
Lead Development Teams for ensuring the sustainability o f the CDCs once the block grants&#13;
havebeen finished andthe FPs have withdrawn from the villages. Once the FPs complete their&#13;
cycle o f support to the communities, MRRD, through these provincial offices, will act as the&#13;
primary interface between CDCs and other development actors. These community led&#13;
development teams will support and guide the CDC re-elections and potential revisions to the&#13;
CDPs. In addition once'the CDC constitution, which i s under preparation by the MRRD, i s&#13;
approved by the Government, these teams will facilitate the implementation o f the provisions&#13;
o f the Constitution at CDC level with further and future guidance from the MRRD The RRD&#13;
team at the district level will comprise o f two staff recruited from that district. Staffs have been&#13;
recruited in the Cycle 2+ communities and will be trained by the FPs during their last year o f&#13;
support to the CDCs. These staff will work closely with the FPs and will be involved in all&#13;
aspects o f facilitation during this year, with CDC re-election a particularly important&#13;
component o f their training and experience. These staff will be a part o f the Community-Led&#13;
Development Department, so there will be an intense focus on this department at the central&#13;
level, to support the development o f their future strategy o f support to the CDCs once the NSP&#13;
has been completed intheir communities.&#13;
&#13;
FacilitatingPartners&#13;
&#13;
At present 24 facilitating partners are engaged inthe ongoing program.          The contracts o f the&#13;
FPs will expire on March 31,2007. However, almost all these FPs will require completing the&#13;
ongoing community mobilization cycle leading to the satisfactory completion o f subprojects,&#13;
some beyond March 31, 2007. In addition, FP services will be required to ensure the&#13;
continuity o f the program inthe NSP I1as the program rolls out to new communities covering&#13;
the districts where FPs are already present and new districts where no FPs are presently&#13;
working. The primaryrole o fthe FacilitatingPartner is to:&#13;
&#13;
     0  Facilitate democratic elections o f inclusive CDCs andtheir registrationwith the&#13;

&#13;
     0  Provide training to communities (e.g. book-keeping, procurement, contracting);&#13;
&#13;
     0  Conduct monitoring and reporting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CommunityDevelopmentCouncils&#13;
&#13;
Community Development Councils (CDCs) will be the primary units responsible for the&#13;
planning and execution o f the subprojects under the facilitation and technical guidance o f the&#13;
FPs. One CDC is formed and established ineach target village through a democratic election&#13;
process. CDC is a community-based decision making body that includes a chairperson, vice-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
chairperson, secretary, and treasurer. CDCs are responsible for overseeing and preparation o f&#13;
the Community Development Plan for their respective villages facilitated by the FPs. The&#13;
Community Development Plans are the basis for identifying and prioritizing the block grant&#13;
investments for subprojects inthe villages. The CDCs are also responsible for the management&#13;
o f block grants within the village, procurement o f subprojects and their implementation.&#13;
Project Management Committees, selected by the community, are responsible for withdrawal&#13;
o f block grant funds from the community account and procure the goods and services required&#13;
to implement the subprojects. Additional subproject committees are established as preferred&#13;
bythe communities to manage individual subprojects or oversee specific tasks.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationinHighRiskAreas&#13;
&#13;
The security environment in which the NSP operates has deteriorated over the course o f the&#13;
program and i s currently at its worst level. The number o f communities and districts where&#13;
NSP activities are suspended has steadily increased. The security situation is the single biggest&#13;
risk facing the NSP 11goal o frollingout the programwith full nationalcoverage.&#13;
&#13;
The deterioration in security presents a number o f dilemmas. MRRD has made a commitment&#13;
to bring the NSP to all rural communities and communities yet to start with the NSP are&#13;
impatient. As part o f the national government, MRRD has the political will and commitment&#13;
to roll out all areas o f the country. The NSP to date has been considered by the communities as&#13;
an effective rural development and village governance and state building program and its&#13;
presence has ensured government visibility and the perception that the government taking&#13;
responsibility for its citizens, particularly inremote rural areas. For the same reasons, the NSP&#13;
has been targeted by anti-government elements in areas with high security risks. Therefore, if&#13;
the NSP suspends its activities, then there i s a political risk that the absence o f government and&#13;
support in those areas would provide an advantage to anti-government elements to win&#13;
sympathy and support from the peoples inthose areas.&#13;
&#13;
The planning and implementation o f the NSP I1in the high risk areas will have to strike a&#13;
pragmatic balance betweenthe state buildingobjectives o f the Government andneedto comply&#13;
with the development effectiveness and outcomes as well as the diligent fiduciary management&#13;
o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
Extensive discussions have taken place with the FPs operating in insecure areas and between&#13;
the government and the OC to identify various options for planning and implementing the NSP&#13;
I1inhighrisk areas. Map 1shows the districts where FPs are active at present and covered the&#13;
villages inthose districts either partially or fully. Map 2 shows the districts with low, moderate&#13;
and highrisks at the time o f appraising the project to illustrate the extent to which the NSP I1&#13;
operation i s likely to be affected due to security risks. Districts rated at low risk at present may&#13;
become high risk area and vice versa during the course o f the implementation. Adequate&#13;
flexibility has been incorporated into the program and procurement planning o f the NSP I1to&#13;
take into account the dynamic nature o f the security situation o f the country.&#13;
&#13;
Inaccessibility to the communities and unwillingness o f the FP and provincial/district staff to&#13;
travel to risk prone villages will undermines the achievement o f the development objectives o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                60&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the NSP 11. The restricted accessibility would pose many other potential programmatic,&#13;
fiduciary, and reputational risks.      These include: (i)inability to train CDCs to ensure&#13;
transparency and equity in carrying out a democratic election o f the CDCs thereby having the&#13;
risk of falling the CDC into the hands of elites, warlords and anti-government elements; (ii)&#13;
inability to supervise the financial management and procurement administration o f the&#13;
subprojects and block grant management; and (iii)reduced quality o f the design, billing and&#13;
construction o f the subprojects leading to potential avenues o f corruption, potential risk o f&#13;
block grants ending up partially in the hands o f anti-government elements, and questionable&#13;
usefulness and sustainability o f the subprojects; and (iii) risk to life o f the operating staff.&#13;
&#13;
Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to fully respect the NSP guiding principles in&#13;
pursuit o f the NSP objectives ininsecure areas. Inhighrisk areas the main threat to the NSP&#13;
objectives is the inability to establish the foundation for local governance, as FPs have&#13;
restricted access to the communities and therefore cannot offer the full facilitation support to&#13;
develop the capacity o f the CDCs and to ensure the CDCs are representative and consultative&#13;
intheir formulation ofthe community development plan. As a result, the focus is more onthe&#13;
delivery o f state building services, rather than inclusive local governance. This means that any&#13;
alternative approach is only realistic incommunities that have already been mobilized, elected&#13;
their CDCs, formulated their development plans and subprojects have already been reviewed&#13;
and approved by the OC.         It is not possible to facilitate the governance component o f the&#13;
programbyremote control, when FPs cannot access the communities.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, it has been agreed that the project, through the National Steering Committee, will&#13;
obtain guidance for program planning and implementation in the high risk areas, particularly&#13;
for the roll out to new communities and new districts. Ifthe accessibility o f these villages and&#13;
districts are restricted, the program roll out to new communities and new districts will not take&#13;
place until the Steering Committee recommends that the security situation has eased off, the&#13;
concerned Communities are willing to receive the services of FPs, the concerned FP and the&#13;
staff o f the Regional staff are willing to travel to those areas, and the Bank task team is&#13;
confident that satisfactory arrangements for implementation supervision, monitoring and&#13;
fiduciary compliance are inplace.&#13;
&#13;
However, inthe case o f communities inhighrisk areas who have been partially mobilized and&#13;
already included in the ongoing FP contracts, a different distance based approach will be&#13;
utilized. If in any village, if the CDC is already in place, CDP has been developed and&#13;
subprojects have been approved by the OC, then the CDC will allow to proceed with the&#13;
implementation. Inthose instances, the subproject implementation would rely on trusted and&#13;
respected independent community members, who could verify the use o f block grant funds and&#13;
the status o f implementation.      In addition, the project implementation will rely upon the&#13;
monitoring by community level procurement and financial management sub-committees.&#13;
Technically complex subprojects, such as micro-hydro power, would not be implemented in&#13;
the absence o f proper technical support.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the initial implementation experience with the above proxy oversight and monitoring&#13;
arrangements, other possible alternative implementation approaches would be explored later&#13;
duringthe implementationphase.&#13;
&#13;

                APPENDIX 5: PROCUREMENTARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
1. CountryContext&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the procurement&#13;
environment in Afghanistan through its involvement in the interim procurement&#13;
arrangements put in place through Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP) as&#13;
well as with the institutions such as Afghanistan Reconstruction andDevelopment Services&#13;
(ARDS) that is holding the current responsibility for government's procurement&#13;
administration. As part o f the broader review o f Afghanistan's Public Finance&#13;
Management (PFM) system, the Bank recently carried out an assessment o f the&#13;
procurement environment inthe country based on the baseline andperformance indicators&#13;
developed by a group o f institutions led by the World Bank and Organization for&#13;
Economic Co-operation and Development (0ECD)Development Assistance Committee&#13;
(DAC).&#13;
&#13;
The first key issue identified through the procurement assessment was the need for&#13;
ownership and a champion inthe Government for reform, deepening o f capacity, ensuring&#13;
integrity in the operation o f procurement systems, and promoting sound procurement&#13;
among ministries."&#13;
&#13;
A new Procurement Law has been adopted inNovember 2005 which radically transforms&#13;
the legal and regulatory framework for the procurement administration o f Afghanistan.&#13;
While it provides a very modern legal system for procurement, effective implementation o f&#13;
the law may encounter difficulties in the current weak institutional structure and capacity&#13;
o f the Government.    It relies, for example, on the establishment o f a procurement policy&#13;
unit (PPLJ) to ensure the implementation through the creation o f secondary legislation,&#13;
standard bidding documents, provision of advice and creation o f the necessary information&#13;
systems for advertising and data collection. It further relies on the development o f an&#13;
independent complaints review mechanism to ensure enforcement.&#13;
These institutional arrangements are yet to be inplace.&#13;
&#13;
Inthe absence of adequate capacity to manage procurement activities effectively, some&#13;
interim arrangements have been put in place to improve the procurement management o f&#13;
the country. A central procurement facilitation service, ARDS has been established under&#13;
the supervision o f Ministry of Economy. The Bank and the Government has agreed on a&#13;
program for country wide procurement reform and capacity building, leading to the&#13;
transition from centralizedto decentralized procurement services. The Bank funded Public&#13;
Administration Capacity Building project (PACBP) is the primary instrument for&#13;
implementing the program to strengthen capacity o f the line ministries to manage public&#13;
procurement in an effective, transparent and accountable manner.              However, the&#13;
implementation o f the procurement capacity buildingstrategy has not made any significant&#13;
progress yet due to lack o f coordination and delays in decision making within the&#13;
Government. The envisaged radical changes to the procurement management environment&#13;
expected from the new Law also require the urgent implementation o f a comprehensive&#13;
human resources and capacity development program.              The implementation o f the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              63&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
procurement reform component o f the PACBP should be considered with due priority to&#13;
ensure that fiduciary standards are further enhanced and that capacity i s developed in the&#13;
Government to maintain these standards.&#13;
&#13;
PartAGeneral&#13;
&#13;
The procurement administration experience o f the ongoing NSP provides useful lessons for&#13;
designing the procurement arrangemento f the NSP 11. The Procurement administration o f&#13;
the NSP I1 would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines:&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004, "Guidelines: Selection&#13;
and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated M a y 2004, and the&#13;
provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement. The general description o f various&#13;
procurements under different expenditure categories are described below. For each&#13;
contract to be financed by the Grant the different procurement methods or consultant&#13;
selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review&#13;
requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Grant Recipient andthe Bank project&#13;
team are described in the Procurement Plan agreed with the Government at appraisal and&#13;
finalized duringnegotiations. This Procurement Planwill be updated at least annually or at&#13;
lesser time intervals as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and&#13;
improvements inthe institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of Works: A large majority o f the works to be procured under this project&#13;
would include community sub-projects. These subprojects are implemented by the&#13;
communities using Block Grant provisions made by the project. Each community will get&#13;
a Block Grant of US$ 200 per family with an upper ceiling o f limit o f US$ 60,000 per&#13;
community. Therefore, the estimated value o f most o f the community subprojects would&#13;
be lesser than US$ 60,000 per project. However, there will be instances where a cluster o f&#13;
adjoining communities will pool up their block grant entitlements to finance large civil&#13;
works subprojects such as a common electrification of the villages from the main power&#13;
grid, rehabilitation o f rural road connecting the villages or refurbishment of an irrigation&#13;
canal serving all the villages. In those cases the value o f a subproject may rise to about&#13;
US$ 500,000 or more depending on the total number o f beneficiary communities. Such&#13;
projects shall be procured following N C B procedures with the assistance o f the&#13;
procurement staff at the central level.&#13;
&#13;
There will, be around 4300 new communities to be financed under the repeater project&#13;
(totaling to 21,000 communities under NSP). Community shall carryout procurement&#13;
following paragraph 3.17 o f Bank's Guidelines. The detailed procurement procedures will&#13;
be listed under the procurement chapter in the NSP Operational Manual which is the&#13;
guideline that i s now being used by the project staff. The OM shall be revised to include&#13;
improved fiduciary oversight and any such revisions will be agreed with the Bank. The&#13;
Operations Manual (OM) shall include national competitive bidding, shopping, direct&#13;
contracting and other methods for the procurement o f goods/and works for the community&#13;
sub projects including methods as required for the selection o f individuals to provide the&#13;
necessary professional inputs in the implementation o f the sub projects. In addition, the&#13;
NSP I1 will finance 73 district schools under the District School Rehabilitation and&#13;
Construction Window (DSCRW) for which contracts have already been awarded under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             64&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ongoing NSP. There will be around 15 civil works packages for renovations/&#13;
improvementhehabilitation o f provincial offices o f the Ministry o f Rural Rehabilitation&#13;
and Development (MRRD). The procurement of all other works contracts will be done&#13;
using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for ICB and National SBD agreed&#13;
with (or satisfactory to) the Bank for all NCB and other procurement methods. A sample&#13;
bidding document for NCB has already been agreedbetween the MRRD and the Bank and&#13;
has been used under NSP 1 for the procurement of civil works under the DSRCW. All     .&#13;
contract estimated to more thanUS$ 100,000 shall beprocured following NCB procedures&#13;
andcontractsbelowUS$ 100,000 shallbeprocured following shopping procedures&#13;
&#13;
Procurementof Goods: Goods procured under this project would include vehicles, office&#13;
furniture and equipment, I T equipment and software, multimedia equipment, conswnables&#13;
for operating equipment, vehicles, basic construction quality control equipment, and office&#13;
equipment, etc. The procurement of goods will be done using Bank's SBD for all ICB and&#13;
National SBD agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank for all NCB. Other procurement&#13;
method will be shopping. All goods contracts estimated to cost more than US$ 200,000&#13;
shall be procured following ICB procedures. The contracts estimated to cost more than&#13;
US$ 100,000 and less than US$ 200,000 shall beprocured following NCB procedures and&#13;
contract estimated to cost less than US$ 100, 000 shall be procured following shopping&#13;
procedures. With the prior agreement with IDA, Direct Contract method shall be used to&#13;
procure goods and services which meet the requirements as per the provision under&#13;
paragraph3.6 o fBank's Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Selection of Consultants: There will be a large number of Technical Assistance (TA)&#13;
contracts under the project. These T A will include the hiring o f Management Support&#13;
Consultant (MSC), Facilitating Partners (FPs) and studies. The MSC will provide the&#13;
management oversight support and technical assistance to the NSPMRRD at center and&#13;
provincial offices and manage the FP contracts. A shortlist and the draft RFP has already&#13;
beenprepared for the selection of the MSC and the procurement process is underway to&#13;
ensure that MSC begins operations from April 1, 2007. There are 24 ongoing Facilitating&#13;
Partner contracts awarded to international and national NGOs. These FPs are already&#13;
active in all 34 provinces o f the country covering as much as 276 districts and provincial&#13;
centers out of total 398 districts and provincial centers of the country.&#13;
&#13;
The FPs are responsible for community mobilizationandproviding technical support to the&#13;
communities for the design and implementation o f subprojects. All these ongoing FP&#13;
contracts under the ongoing NSP have a three year cycle to complete community&#13;
mobilization and subprojects. All the ongoing FP contracts under NSP Iwill end by&#13;
March 31,2007. However these contracts need to be continued to complete the second and&#13;
third year cycles of community facilitation process of the communities included in the&#13;
NSP.     The number o f such communities will include around 5,100 communities to&#13;
undergo the third year cycle (Cycle II+)     and 6800 communities to undergo both year 2&#13;
 (Cycle 11) and year 3 (Cycle I1+) cycles. Therefore in order to complete the community&#13;
mobilization and subprojects in these villages, it is necessary to adopt a procurement&#13;
method to field FPs beyond March 31, 2007 that would ensure smooth continuation o f the&#13;
process with no or minimumdisruption to the program. Inthis case, deploying a new FP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              65&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to take over the work from the existing FP and facilitate the communities through the&#13;
remaining cycles would be disruptive to the program.               Therefore these contract&#13;
assignments could be considered in compliance with paragraphs 3.9-3.12 o f Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for the Selectiono f Consultants. Based on the above it has been agreed between&#13;
the Government and IDA that the ongoing FP contract that will expire on or before March&#13;
31, 2007 will be extended following Single Source Selection Procedure. MRRD/NSP has&#13;
agreed to take action to request for technical and financial proposals from the relevant&#13;
Facilitating partners and finalize contracts prior to mid January 2007. Award o f such&#13;
contracts shall also be subject to a performance appraisal carried out bythe borrower.&#13;
&#13;
As the NSP I1 rolls out to cover the remaining villages o f the entire country, new&#13;
communities will be added to the program in districts where the present FPs are already&#13;
active and indistricts where no FP has moved to yet. However, it has been recommended&#13;
to reduce the time period for community facilitation cycle from 3 years to 2 years under&#13;
NSP 11. The number o f new communities that will be added to the program during the&#13;
NSP I1phase in the districts where FPs are already active will be around 2000 and inthe&#13;
districts that NSP i s not present currently will be around 2,300 thus making a total o f 4300&#13;
new communities to be contracted out to facilitating partners inNSP 11. It has been agreed&#13;
with the borrower to the extent possible to package the facilitating partner contracts inthe&#13;
on going districts to follow a competitive procedure considering economy, efficiency and&#13;
security concerns. Therefore a competitive selection process (FBS) is proposed for the&#13;
selection o f FPs in the proposed 2,300 new communities in new NSP districts and&#13;
SSSEBS process will be followed to select the FPs for the proposed 2000 new&#13;
communities in existing NSP districts. The selection o f consultants under the project will&#13;
include QCBS, QBS, CQS, LCS, FBS SSS and individual consultants in accordance with&#13;
Section V o f bank's Guidelines for the Selection o f Consultants. Threshold for CQS&#13;
procedure will be US$200,000 per contract.&#13;
&#13;
There will be a large number o f individual consultancy contracts for both national and&#13;
international. These contracts will be procured following Section V o f Bank's Guidelines&#13;
for the Selectiono f Consultants.&#13;
&#13;
Short lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance with the&#13;
provisions o fparagraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Incremental Operational Costs which would be financed by the project would be&#13;
procured usingthe implementing agency's administrative procedures which were reviewed&#13;
and found acceptable to the Bank.&#13;

Procurement activities will be carried out by the NSP unit under the MRRD. Inthe NSP,&#13;
MRRD has been assisted by an international procurement advisor of the Oversight&#13;
Consultant as well as individual international and national consultants to carryout&#13;
procurement activities, which involved procurement o f goods/works and technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
assistance (FP contracts etc.). At the project start-up, there had been initial delays in the&#13;
procurement actions, but the overall procurement administration o f the MRRD has&#13;
improved andthe quality of the procurement processinghas been at an acceptable level.&#13;
&#13;
Unlike in NSP Iwhere the procurement of NSP was being handled separately by the&#13;
MRRD Procurement Department, the DSCRW Procurement Officers, and the NSP OC&#13;
Procurement Advisor, for NSP I1it is proposedthat all NSP procurement inmerged inthe&#13;
newly established NSP Procurement Department. The Department will temporarily be&#13;
headed by an international contracted through the Oversight Consultants Team till 31''&#13;
March 2007. A national deputy head o f department, and 3 senior and 3 junior procurement&#13;
officers will staff the department.&#13;
&#13;
The procurement unit o f MRRD i s already having sufficient capacity. At present this unit&#13;
has the services o f two national procurement advisors who are familiar with The World&#13;
Bank and national procurement procedures. An assessment o f the capacity o f the MRRD&#13;
and the NSP unit to implement the procurement actions under the project was carried out&#13;
in September by Deepal Fernando, Senior Procurement Specialist, of the Afghanistan&#13;
Country Office. The assessment reviewed the proposed organizational structure for the&#13;
implementation o f the NSP and the capacity o f the MRRD is adequate to handle the&#13;
procurement activities o f the proposedproject. It is also envisaged to obtain the services o f&#13;
an International Procurement Advisor together with additional procurement officers to&#13;
strengthen the procurement capacity o f the unit for a limitedperiod. .The NSP Unitwill be&#13;
responsible for day-to-day project management including procurement,                financial&#13;
management, progress and financial reporting, staff appointment and management, and&#13;
project monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
The MRRDcurrently procures items such as vehicles, generators, pumps, office equipment&#13;
etc using their own resources as well as the funds received from the other donors. The&#13;
DeputyMinister for Programs has delegated the authority to approve procurements valued&#13;
up to AF250,OOO (approximately US$5,000) and the Minister has delegated the authority&#13;
to approve procurements valued up to AF3,000,000 (US$60,000) under the current&#13;
Procurement Law. For all procurement over these values the approval authority would&#13;
remain the Ministryo f Finance and the presidential office for contracts more than US$3.0&#13;
m.&#13;
&#13;
However inorder to strengthen the capacity o f the MRRDthe following capacity building&#13;
programs are planned.&#13;

&#13;
In addition, provisions are included in the project's cost estimate to provide,advanced&#13;
procurement training to 1-2 selected procurement staff o f the MRRDat a reputed overseas&#13;
institute as a measure for long term procurement capacity building o f the MRRD. These&#13;
internationally trained staff will be used as trainers to train a cadre o f local procurement&#13;
staffwithin the MRRDduringthe project period.&#13;
&#13;
The procurement risk at the MRRD level could be considered as "Average". As majority&#13;
o f the procurement is carried out by communities at the village level that risk i s "High". In&#13;
order to mitigate such high risks fiduciary safeguards including those related to&#13;
procurement and social audit will be built into the system and explained inthe OM andthe&#13;
Financial Manual.&#13;
&#13;
PartCProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
The Grant Recipient,       at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project&#13;
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This planhas been&#13;
agreed between the Grant Recipient and the Project Team on November 2, 2006 and i s&#13;
available at Procurement Department o f the NSP Headquarters, Dam1 Aman, Kabul,&#13;
Afghanistan. It will also be available inthe Project's database and on the Bank's external&#13;
website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team&#13;
annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and&#13;
improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
PartDFrequencyof ProcurementSupervision&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition to the prior review supervisionto be carriedout from Bankoffices, the capacity&#13;
assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended one procurement review per&#13;
year in the field to carry out post review of procurement actions and the compliance with&#13;
the agreedprocedures at community level.&#13;
&#13;
PartESocialAudit&#13;
&#13;
Major challenge in projects o f this nature lies in ensuring that the accepted procurement&#13;
procedures are followed. Considering that procurement under the large number o f sub&#13;
projects to be financed under the project will be carried out by communities and due to&#13;
large sum o f sub projects it would not be feasible to carry-out procurement review/audit as&#13;
ina normal investment project. Therefore it is proposedto carryout a social audit through&#13;
participatory andtransparent process.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional arrangements for social audit at the village level (CDC) will provide the&#13;
framework needed to ensure that there is checks//balances and transparency in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
    procurement process including access to information related to procurement. The&#13;
     information related to procurement under block grants will be disseminated to the public.&#13;
     Such information will be provided in the notice board o f the village mosque, CDC office&#13;
     notice board. In addition the information i s disclosed at large gathering o f villagers at&#13;
     meetings as per the current practice under NSP. Experience has shown that social audit&#13;
     including participatory and transparent process is the most powerful tool to ensure the&#13;
     funds are usedfor the purposes intended.&#13;
&#13;
     IDA shall carryout ex-post reviews during supervision missions to verify the compliance&#13;
     with the fiduciary requirements including those related to procurement such as&#13;
     procurement planning with the participation o f beneficiaries, procurement actions and&#13;
     required approvals recorded in the NSP recordlogbook. In addition such reviews will be&#13;
     conducted by an external agency where IDA staff cannot access due to the security&#13;
     situation.&#13;

         Several contracts have been entered into by the MRRD utilizing these&#13;
         bilateral funds without the Bank's prior review during NSP I.These&#13;
         contracts will be continued into NSP 11.&#13;
&#13;
         It should be also noted here that the entire NSP national staff (numbering&#13;
         around 600) would be contracted staff ("consultants") and not MRRD civil&#13;
         servants. However they will be contracted following staff recruitment&#13;
         procedures and not as procured contractors. The recruitment procedures&#13;
         follow advertisements and competitive procedures including written tests&#13;
         and interviews. Those consultants whose contract value will exceed the&#13;
         stated value will be submitted for prior review bythe Bank.&#13;

      Some of the funding for NSP will come from bilateral funding arrangements that&#13;
      were signed in NSP Ibut will continue into NSP 11. Several contracts have been&#13;
      entered into by the MRRD utilizing these bilateral funds without the Bank's prior&#13;

      It should be also noted here that the entire NSP national staff (numbering around&#13;
      600) would be contracted staff ("consultants")           and not MRRD civil servants.&#13;
      However they will be contracted following staff recruitment procedures and not as&#13;

          APPENDIX 6: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. CountryIssues&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the financial&#13;
management environment in Afghanistan through the large number o f projects under&#13;
implementation over the past four years. The Public Administration Capacity Building&#13;
Project (PACBP) i s the primaryinstrumentto continue and enhance the fiduciary measures&#13;
put inplace during the past years to help ensure transparency and accountability for the&#13;
fundingprovidedbythe Bank andother donors.&#13;
&#13;
A PFM performance rating system using 28 high-level indicators that was developed by&#13;
the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability multi-agency partnership program&#13;
(PEFA) was applied inAfghanistan inJune 2005. PEFA is comprised o f the World Bank,&#13;
IMF, EC, and several other agencies. The system is structured around six core dimensions&#13;
o f PFM performance: (i)     budget credibility; (ii)&#13;
                                                   comprehensiveness and transparency; (iii)&#13;
policy-based budgeting; (iv) predictability and control inbudget execution; (v) accounting,&#13;
recording, and reporting; and (vi) external scrutiny and audit.&#13;
&#13;
Afghanistan's ratings against the PFM performance indicators generally portray a public&#13;
sector where financial resources are, by and large, being used for their intended purposes.&#13;
This has been accomplishedwith very highlevels o f support from international firms; this&#13;
assistance will continue to be needed over the medium term if these ratings are to be&#13;
maintained.&#13;
&#13;
There is also much room for improvement. In spite o f undeniable gains made in&#13;
reconstruction since the end o f 2001, the challenges facing Afghanistanremain immense;&#13;
not least because o f the tenuous security situation in the region and continued prevalence&#13;
o f a large illegal and illicit economy. The policy framework benchmarks have not yet been&#13;
fully costed so various priorities are funded through the annual budgeting process. The&#13;
rising costs o f the security sector constitute the major constraint on attainment o f fiscal&#13;
sustainability. With regard to executive oversight, the national assembly will play an&#13;
increasingly active role. All in all, the new national strategy has created highexpectations&#13;
o f the executive which could prove to be quite difficult to meet.&#13;
&#13;
The public sector, in spite o f considerable efforts to reform its core functions, remains&#13;
extremely weak outside o f Kabul. The lack o f skilled staff in the civil service and the&#13;
absence o f qualified counterparts inthe government after 30 years or war and conflicts is a&#13;
bindingconstraint. Delays inreforming the pay structure andgrading o f civil servants have&#13;
severely crippled the public administration o f the country. Domestic revenues lag behind&#13;
expenditures by a factor o f ten to one. Large-scale corruption could emerge to undermine&#13;
the government's efforts to enhance aid flows through national accounts. Capacities to&#13;
track expenditures and monitor expenditure outcomes have improved, but they need rapid&#13;
and substantial strengthening if progress toward the attainment o f national development&#13;
targets is to be monitored. Currently, 75% of external revenues bypass government&#13;
appropriation systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                79&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The World Bank is financing a Financial Management Advisor to assist the Ministry o f&#13;
Finance, an Audit Advisor to assist the Control and Audit Office, and a Procurement&#13;
Advisor to assist inProcurement-related activities. Also an Internal Audit function is being&#13;
developed within the Ministry o f Finance with World Bank financing. USAID and earlier&#13;
the IndianAid Assistance Program are also financing a team o f consultants and advisors to&#13;
assist the D a Afghanistan Bank in local as well as foreign currency operations. The&#13;
activities carried out under the existing Public Administration projects have helped the&#13;
Government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are maintained for public&#13;
expenditures, including those supported bythe Bank andthe donor community.&#13;
&#13;
Progress has been slower than expected inshifting from operations support provided by the&#13;
three Advisors to capacity development andknowledge transfer to the civil servants. Given&#13;
that, is expected that the Advisors will continue to be required for the medium term.&#13;
Challenges still remain in attaining the agreed upon fiduciary standards and also to further&#13;
enhance them. And to make matters more complex, the regulatory environment in&#13;
Afghanistan has advanced significantly in the past three years.              Unfortunately, even&#13;
mastery o f basic skills inthe early environment does not fully qualify the civil servants to&#13;
work effectively inthe new emerging environment.&#13;
&#13;

3. Strengths andWeaknesses&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
The Government provides assurance to the Bank and other donors that the measures in&#13;
place to ensure appropriate utilization o f funds will not be circumvented. The Government&#13;
support for PACBP i s strength in itself to enhance financial management in Treasury&#13;
operations, public procurement, internal audit inthe public sector, and external audit by the&#13;
Auditor General,&#13;
&#13;
A specific strength o fthe project is that this is a follow-up project, andthat it already has a&#13;
number of mechanisms in place which will significantly reduce the financial risks&#13;
associated with a large national program. These mechanisms include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     82&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       MRRD has initiated reforms of the ministry's administrative and financial&#13;
       f i c t i o n s (including procurement and finance), the appointment o f financial and&#13;
       procurement advisers, continuous review and modification, when required, o f&#13;
       financial management and audit arrangements as well as disbursement systems, and&#13;
       training o f staff at national and provincial levels in financial management and&#13;
       procurement.&#13;
       The extension o f the contract o f the Oversight Consultant (OC) till March 31, 2007&#13;
       and the change in the Terms o f Reference to include financial management o f all&#13;
       NSP funds. This centralization i s envisaged to provide top NSP management with&#13;
       the required financial indicators for program planning and steering. The OC's&#13;
       financial management responsibility will be assumed by the Management Support&#13;
       Consultant (MSC) inApril 2007.&#13;
       There i s a Memorandum o f Understanding signed by the D a Afghanistan Bank,&#13;
       MRRDand the OC detailing financial and bankingarrangements for NSP. Since&#13;
       2004, provincial branches o f DAB are being used for the transfer o f block grant&#13;
       funds to accounts held by beneficiary communities. The DAB has made an&#13;
       exception to its rule o f not servicing private bank accounts inthe case o f the NSP&#13;
       Oversight Consultant and C D bank accounts.&#13;
       The MRRD, M o F and the OC/MSC have drafted a disbursement protocol on&#13;
       financial arrangements andprocedures&#13;
       The Oversight Consultant's team o f Headquarters, regional and provincial finance&#13;
       and block grant officers have been trained and are proficient in the block grant&#13;
       disbursement procedure and financial management requirements.&#13;
       The Oversight Consultant's national staff, most o f whom have been employed&#13;
       since 2004, will constitute the core NSP implementation staff that will be hired by&#13;
       the program. This means that institutional knowledge, technical know how and&#13;
       familiarity with financial safeguards gained in Phase 1 will not be lost to the&#13;
       program.&#13;
       The Operations Manual which includes the financial management arrangement i s&#13;
       now in its second version, incorporating changes in disbursement procedures&#13;
       gained from 3 years experience o f program implementation.&#13;
       The Facilitating Partners, who are in place now for 3 years have also established&#13;
       local capacities that include a trained network o f social organizers, engineers,&#13;
       trainers, monitors, provincial coordinators. This facilitates the process o f&#13;
       community mobilization,           sub-project  preparation and implementation       in&#13;
       compliance with NSP transparency rules for sub-project expenditures. Facilitating&#13;
       Partners have also provided capacity building on simple financial management in&#13;
       beneficiary communities&#13;
&#13;
Weaknesses andAction Plan&#13;
&#13;
The mainweakness inthis project, as inmany others inAfghanistan, is the ability to attract&#13;
suitably qualified and experienced counterpart staff especially for Financial Management.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. ImplementingEntity&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry o f Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) is responsible for the&#13;
implementation o f the project. Given that this i s a repeater project, the experience gained&#13;
byMRRDinthe first phase would be o ftremendous advantage. The Inter-Ministerial NSP&#13;
Steering Committee chaired by the Vice President o f Afghanistan will serve as the&#13;
oversight body. The Committee will convene at least every quarter to review progress with&#13;
implementation andreview and approve work plans andbudget.&#13;
&#13;
The Management Support Consultant (MSC) that will take full responsibility for the&#13;
financial management o f the project will report through the Minister o f MRRDto the NSP&#13;
Steering Committee. The MSC will be headed by a relevant qualified and experienced&#13;
staff, and may also double as the head o f one o f the two key units within the MSC; these&#13;
are Finance and Block Grant Management unit and Management Information System&#13;
(MIS) unit. The Finance and Block Grant Management unit will consist of relevant&#13;
qualified and experienced staff to be located inthe NSP Kabul office, regional offices and&#13;
provincial offices.&#13;
&#13;
The MSC will also provide adequate financial management guidance and support to the&#13;
communities benefiting from block grants, ensure that financial management responsibility&#13;
i s devolve to them, that procedures are fully accountable to the government apparatus and&#13;
the communities concerned, introduce a high level o f transparency, and simplify&#13;
procedures and processes. M S C will work closely with the Director General o f MRRD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               84&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
finance department to carry out day-to-day financial management operations o f the project,&#13;
preparation o f M-16 forms (payment orders), project coding sheet, B27 allotment form and&#13;
overall contract andproject management.&#13;
&#13;
The M I S unit will also integrate fiduciary management at the community level with&#13;
monitoring and evaluation to ensure a close link between technicaVprogress reporting and&#13;
financial reporting, andto support the validity o fthe expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
5. Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
A budget committee will be appointed to coordinate the preparation o f annual work plan&#13;
and the derivation o f annual budget there from. This committee will be made up o f&#13;
representatives from MSC and MRRD and will report to the Project Steering Committee.&#13;
The Budget Committee will also coordinate quarterly budget reviews to ensure adequate&#13;
budget discipline and control. The committee will be responsible for ensuring that projects&#13;
expenditures expended in a fiscal year are captured in the Governmental Development&#13;
budget o f that fiscal year. The MRRD must get an approval from the presidential office&#13;
and the parliament to be attached to B27 and PCS forms at the time o f requesting yearly&#13;
allotments for contracts under development project to avoid delays when payments are&#13;
processed.&#13;
&#13;
6. FundsFlow&#13;
&#13;
The standard mechanism o f flow o f funds inAfghanistanwill be followed inthis project.&#13;
Project funds will be deposited in the Designated Account (DA) which has already been&#13;
opened by the SDU at the D a Afghanistan Bank.           The DA, in keeping with current&#13;
practices for other projects in Afghanistan, will be operated by the SDU in the Treasury&#13;
Department o f the MoF. Requests for payments out o f the DA will be made to the SDU by&#13;
MRRDwhen needed.&#13;
&#13;
The main component under the project i s community Block Grants for sub-projects. Funds&#13;
for these grants will be transferred to the communities by the Management Support&#13;
Consultant from a block grant bank account maintained by the Management Support&#13;
Consultant in the D a Afghanistan Bank.        Funds to the block grants account will be&#13;
transferred through direct payment by the World Bank. Evidence o f utilization o fprevious&#13;
advance for the purpose intended including progress reports and bank statements from&#13;
communities should be provided by MSC through the MRRD to the M o F before&#13;
submission o f direct payment withdrawal application for the next advance to the Bank.&#13;
Details o f operating the account together with the process o f accounting for expenditures&#13;
and receiving further advances from the Bank will be documented in the Financial&#13;
Management Manual.&#13;
&#13;
A new feature in this phase is the inclusion o f an operations fimd component to be&#13;
managed and administeredby the Management Support Consultant. Operating costs means&#13;
project related incremental expenses incurred on account o f project implementation&#13;
support and management including the rental o f office space, the operation, maintenance,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              85&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rental and insurance o f vehicles,         fuel, communications supplies and charges,&#13;
advertisements, books and periodicals, office administration and maintenance costs, bank&#13;
transaction charges, utility charges, domestic travel and per diem, and remuneration of&#13;
employees excluding salaries o f staff o f MRRD's civil service.&#13;
&#13;
All NSP implementation and management costs that are below the minimum withdrawal&#13;
application limit will be paid out o f the operations fund bank account operated by the&#13;
Management Support Consultant. Funds to the operations fund account are transferred by&#13;
direct payment by the World Bank. Evidence o f utilization o f previous advance for the&#13;
purpose intended should be provided by MSC through the MRRD to the MoF before&#13;
submission o f direct payment withdrawal application for the next advance to the Bank.&#13;
Details o f operating the account together with the process o f accounting for expenditures&#13;
and receiving futher    advances from the Bank will be documented in the Financial&#13;
Management Manual.&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition to payments out of the DA, the implementingentities could also request the&#13;
SDUto make direct payments to consultants or consulting firms, and specialcommitments&#13;
for contracts covered by letters o f credit will follow the World Bank procedures. All&#13;
project payments are expected to be made to either international or local firms that have&#13;
bank accounts in DAB or a commercial bank in Afghanistan or an overseas bank. All&#13;
payments will be made either through bank transfers into the account o f such firms or by&#13;
check.&#13;
&#13;
7. Retroactive financing&#13;
&#13;
To provide maximum financing flexibility, it has been agreed that the Government may&#13;
claim up to US$ 40,000,000 (33 % o f the IDA grant amount) as retroactive financing for&#13;
expenditures financed after October 1, 2006 and prior to the signing date of the Grant&#13;
Agreement.&#13;

&#13;
Ministry o f Finance has authorization to disburse finds from the Credit/Grant, specimen&#13;
signatures o f authorized signatories in M o F will be submitted to the Bank prior to&#13;
commencing disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
9. Accounting&#13;
&#13;
The Oversight Consultant has put in place a tailor made computerized accounting system&#13;
for the sub-grant component o f the project. The system generates cash book records and&#13;
statements o f expenditures (SOEs). The system has been designed to record all grant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            87&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
transactions and to generate periodic summary reports for this component. It i s also linked&#13;
to the NSP databasethat contains all the social andtechnical (metric) information collected&#13;
from the communities and sub-projects. The Management Support Consultant i s expected&#13;
to continue usingthe financial modulehlock grant accounting system.&#13;
&#13;
The Management Support Consultant will put inplace a computerized accounting system&#13;
to record all expenditures for the operations component o f the project. The system will&#13;
follow the categories inthe government Chart o f Accounts, with sub categories established&#13;
to facilitate expenditure monitoring andpreparation o f SOEs.&#13;
&#13;
For overall grant accounting purposes, the government's computerized accounting system&#13;
(AFMIS) will be used for reporting, financial statements and audits. The FMManual will&#13;
also establish project financial management in accordance with standard Afghan&#13;
government policies andprocedures, including use o f the government Chart o f Accounts to&#13;
record project expenditures. The use o f these procedures will enable adequate recording&#13;
and reporting o fproject expenditures. Overall project accounts will be maintained centrally&#13;
inSDU, whichwill be ultimately responsible for recording of all expenditures andreceipts&#13;
inthe Government's accountingsystem. The SDUwill beresponsible for accountingof all&#13;
expenditures and receipts in AFMIS,including the supporting documentation, which will&#13;
be the basis for preparation o f reports to IDA as well as to the government. The&#13;
Management Support Consultant will work closely with the MRRD Director General o f&#13;
Finance in i)preparation o f supporting documents for expenditures, ii)preparation o f&#13;
payment orders (M16s), iii)obtain approval for M16s by the Minister or Deputy Minister&#13;
depending on the payment amount and iv) submission to the SDU for verification and&#13;
payment.&#13;
&#13;
Reconciliation o f project expenditure with M o F records will be carried out by the MRRD&#13;
Finance department, with support from the MSC. Annual project financial statements will&#13;
be consolidated centrally at the SDU. The statements would include a summary o f fhds&#13;
received (showing funds received from all sources), and a summary o f expenditures shown&#13;
under the main Project components/activities and by the main categories o f expenditures.&#13;
These statements should also disclose a statement o f financial affairs at the end o f the year&#13;
anddescribe allmajor accountingpolicies usedinpreparingthe statement.&#13;
&#13;
Inorder to maintain transparency, accountability and control over the whole funding for&#13;
the NSP program, it i s required that M R R D M o F should prepare a consolidated account&#13;
annually for NSP, incorporating all Donors andAfghanistan Government funding received&#13;
and the expenditures made there from. This consolidated report should indicate amounts&#13;
for the current fiscal year and cumulative to date. It will be the responsibility o f MRRD&#13;
and MoF to submit this report to all Donors, along with the required individual project's&#13;
audited financial statements and management letter for the year, within six months o f the&#13;
endo fthe fiscal year.&#13;

&#13;
Project-specific procedures for requests and approval o f funds will be described inthe FM&#13;
Manual to be developed before disbursements begin including segregation of duties,&#13;
documentation reviews, physical asset control, andcash handlingandmanagement.&#13;
Adequate procedures, guidelines and controls on payment o f block grants to benefiting&#13;
communities will be included inthe FMManual.&#13;
&#13;
The project financial management systems will be subject to review by the newly&#13;
established internal audit directorate o f the MoF, according to programs to be determined&#13;
bythe Director o fInternal Audit usinga risk-basedapproach.&#13;
&#13;
11. ExternalAudit&#13;
&#13;
The project accounts will be auditedby the Auditor General, with the support o fthe Audit&#13;
Advisor, with terms o f reference satisfactory to the Association. The audit o f the project&#13;
accounts will include an assessment o f the: (a) adequacy o f the accounting and internal&#13;
control systems; (b) ability to maintain adequate documentation for transactions; and (c)&#13;
eligibility o f incurred expenditures for Association financing. The audited annual project&#13;
financial statements will be submitted within six months of the close o f fiscal year. All&#13;
agencies involved in implementation and holding records of expenditures would need to&#13;
retainthese records as per the IDA retentionpolicy.&#13;
&#13;

management arrangements. The team will:&#13;
&#13;
      Review the project's quarterly un-audited interim financial reports as well as the&#13;
      project's annual audited financial statements and auditor's management letter.&#13;
&#13;
      Review the project's financial management and disbursement arrangements&#13;
      (including a review of a sample of SOEs and movements on the Designated&#13;
      Account, Community Block Grant Account and Operations Fund Account) to&#13;
      ensure compliance with the Bank's minimumrequirements.&#13;
&#13;
      Review agency performance in managing project funds to ensure that it is timely,&#13;
      accurate, and accountable. Particular supervision emphasis will be placed on asset&#13;
      management and supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0  Review of financial management risk rating and compliance with all covenants.&#13;

     APPENDIX 7: MONITORINGAND EVALUATIONARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. MainObjectives&#13;
&#13;
The monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system for the NSP I1 is intended to provide&#13;
information to the relevant stakeholders on project implementation performance, process,&#13;
outputs, and outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
The project M&amp;E system will be based on the seven key components: (a) implementation&#13;
monitoring, (b) post-implementation monitoring, (c) a complaints handling, (d) a baseline&#13;
survey, (e) an impact evaluation on some key qualitative indicators, (f) analytical works&#13;
and (g) an external evaluation study at the end o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
MRRDwill fullyintegrateM&amp;Edatabaseinto the MISbyeffectiveness ofthe Grant.Such&#13;
integratedM I S will ensure the smooth information flow at all levels as a management tool.&#13;
&#13;
2. InstitutionalArrangement for M&amp;E&#13;
&#13;
The NSP M&amp;E department o f the MRRD will be responsible for coordinating the M&amp;E&#13;
tasks, liaising with FPs, provincial M&amp;E staff and OC inthe collection andreporting o f the&#13;
required data. The M&amp;E data will be continuously updated and consolidated quarterly for&#13;
provision to the Bank task team, and will be made available to coincide with the&#13;
supervision missions o f the project. M&amp;E department will be supported by the Provincial&#13;
M&amp;Estaff aswell as the FPsat theprovince anddistrict level.&#13;
&#13;
3. MonitoringArrangements&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
The primary objective is to monitor the progress o f the projects based on the measurable&#13;
outcome/outputs as listed inthe Appendix 1.&#13;
&#13;
At community level, CDCs will be responsible, with the support from the FPs, for&#13;
monitoring their own progress based on a few selected key indicators (e.g. on&#13;
process/participation, implementation progress/results, and expenditures). At the same&#13;
time, a community participatory monitoring system will be piloted during the first six&#13;
months and be expanded if successful. Communities will monitor procurement, financial&#13;
management, implementation andmaintenance o f the subprojects, and FP's performance.&#13;
&#13;
Facilitating Partners (FPs) will continue to be responsible for the implementation&#13;
monitoring, focusing on inputs, process and output level, using the communities as the&#13;
basic unit o f monitoring. The FPs will prepare a brief monthly report on the&#13;
implementation status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             93&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
At district level, FPs will prepare quarterly progress reports, which cover the district(s) or&#13;
province(s) inwhich the particular FP is responsible for the facilitation o fNSP.&#13;
&#13;
At province level, FP prepares a quarterly report based on the district reports and feed the&#13;
M I S with the information collected. Moreover, the Provincial M&amp;E staff o f MRRD will&#13;
further assess the quality o fthe subprojects as well as the governance capacity o f CDCs.&#13;
&#13;
At the national level, MRRD M&amp;E department analyzes the data collected and prepares&#13;
quarterly progress reports for the project as a whole, which will be shared with key&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
Post-implementationmonitoring&#13;
&#13;
The objectives are primarily to assess the sustainability o f the subprojects and the&#13;
governance capacity o f CDCs beyond subproject completion. This will be carried out, on&#13;
random sample basis, by the NSP M&amp;E department three and six months after the&#13;
subprojects are completed.&#13;
&#13;
Complaints Handling&#13;
&#13;
A Complaints Handling Mechanism will be introduced in NSP 11. This serves as an&#13;
important channel for the community members to report their complaints especially when&#13;
there are problems vis-a-vis the FPs or other aspects o f the program. A Complaints&#13;
HandlingSpecialist inthe MRRDwill be hired and a number publicized on posters where&#13;
communities can directly call or send an SMS. There will also be a suggestion box at&#13;
strategic areas such as mosques, community halls, markets, coffee shops. The complaints&#13;
can also come from facilitators. The incoming complaints are categorized, registered into&#13;
database, verified and addressed either by FPs or Complaints Handling Specialist.&#13;
Appropriate and timely action will be taken to by the MRRD to address those complaints,&#13;
and ifnecessary, with assistance from the National Steering Committee.&#13;
&#13;
4. BaselineSurvey&#13;
&#13;
During the facilitation process, FPs will collect some key basic information of the&#13;
communities, such as demographic data, availability o f resources and facility and etc,&#13;
usinga standardized form called"Community Profile Form". The data will be entered into&#13;
the MIS and be analyzed to generate baseline information. DuringNSP 11, GPS code will&#13;
be added to the form in order to provide an accurate geographical information o f targeted&#13;
communities.&#13;
&#13;
5. ImpactEvaluationthroughRandomization&#13;
&#13;
The absence o f a baseline beyond the community profile made it difficult to accurately&#13;
assess the economic, political and social impact o f NSP implementation on targeted&#13;
communities. Information on the role o f CDCs in facilitating institutional changes at&#13;
village-level has been particularly absent. As a central component o f the NSP has been the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              94&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development o f new community-level representation, it i s important to understand the&#13;
effectiveness o f CDCs in promoting durable changes in the institutional structure o f the&#13;
villages, including the introductiono f norms o f representative governance.&#13;
&#13;
NSP I1 will therefore introduce a robust impact evaluation to examine the major&#13;
institutional and socio-economic impacts o f the program. In order to obtain unbiased&#13;
estimates o f program effects, in a number o f new districts, the implementation schedule o f&#13;
the NSP will be randomized in order to ensure that there is no relationship between the&#13;
underlying characteristics o f the community and its prioritization in the roll-out schedule.&#13;
This will divide the sample between those communities randomly selected to participate in&#13;
year 1, the "treatment group", and those communities selected for participation in years 2&#13;
and 3, the "control group". At the end o f year 1, a survey will be conducted across both the&#13;
treatment and control groups, the results o f which will allow for the clear identification o f&#13;
the institutional andsocio-economic impacts o fthe NSP program.&#13;
&#13;
6. Analytical Works&#13;
&#13;
Running analytical work in parallel to the ongoing activities will enable an interactive&#13;
process whereby findings from the field can be fed into design modification. Issues&#13;
identified as most critical include engineering quality o f electrification project, technical&#13;
quality o f sub-projects, social and environmental impact o f sub-projects, and economic rate&#13;
o f return analysis o f sub-projects. Those key analytical works will be conducted in the&#13;
course o f the project and will form a basis o f the mid-term review and the project end&#13;
evaluation. FP will be asked to write up the case studies on certain topics which can be&#13;
widely shared as lessons learnt.&#13;
&#13;
7. Mid-termReview&#13;
&#13;
During the second year o f the project, a mid-term review will be conducted in order to&#13;
assess whether the NSP I1is achieving the objectives as planned, and to initiate corrective&#13;
measures ifdeemed necessary.&#13;
&#13;
8. ExternalEvaluation&#13;
&#13;
At the end o fthe project, an external evaluationwill assess the project impact andprovide&#13;
the recommendation for a third phase. The evaluation will specifically assess whether the&#13;
target set in Annex I1had been achieved at the end o f the project, based on findings from&#13;
the analytical works, the impact evaluation and monitoring records during the project.&#13;
IDA will produce an Implementation Completion Report, which will focus on evaluating&#13;
whether the project objectives and targets for keyperformance indicators have beenmet.&#13;
&#13;
9. Management Information System&#13;
&#13;
NSP's M I S has been usedless as a project management tool and more as a database, which&#13;
is a means o f publishing output metrics. NSP I1M I S will be modified to encompass all&#13;
aspects of NSP and not just CDC and sub-project data, including modules on M&amp;E,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              95&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financial management, FP contract monitoring, Procurement, HR, etc. The M&amp;E/MIS&#13;
databasewill continue to be updated andmaintainedby the OC.&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, NSP I1 will provide support for the financing o f consultant(s) for the&#13;
institutional strengthening o f the MRRD MIS. This is geared towards designing an&#13;
integratedM I S which will encompass information o f all the projects under MRRDinorder&#13;
to help the ministry to manage information ina standard andunified form, and also to meet&#13;
the nation wide requirement o f information for the Interim Afghanistan National&#13;
Development Strategy (I-ANDs).The process will include, gathering information to meet&#13;
requirements o f various stakeholders,        Designing o f operational procedures and&#13;
organizational structures and designing o f the information system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

       APPENDIX 8: ARRANGEMENTS FOR QUALITYASSURANCEOF&#13;
                                      SUBPROJECTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
As o f the appraisal o fthe NSP 11,the ongoing NSP includes about 20,180 subprojects o f&#13;
which about which 19,750 are ongoing, and 6,900 have been completed by the&#13;
beneficiary communities using the block grants. A large majority o f these subprojects&#13;
include, in the descending order o f the community demand, the new construction and&#13;
refurbishment o f village level facilities such as: drinking water and sanitation; gravelled&#13;
roads and culverts, irrigation works, village electrification; school buildings; public&#13;
buildings (mosques, community centers, public baths etc.); andhealth clinics.&#13;
&#13;
There i s an increasing demand for micro-hydro power projects for the communities. In&#13;
addition, a small number o f non-engineering,          income generation and livelihood&#13;
promotion subprojects too have been financed.             Communities have consistently&#13;
prioritized small scale infrastructure projects and on average implement two subprojects&#13;
with their block grant allocations.      On average about 55% o f all projects involve&#13;
productive infrastructure such as irrigation, roads and village electrification thereby&#13;
promoting productivity and stimulating local economies.          A futher 26% o f projects&#13;
involve safe water and sanitation which assures better health for the communities. In&#13;
addition, the NSP includes the construction o f 67 schools in different districts chosen by&#13;
the communities under the District School Rehabilitation and Construction Window.&#13;
&#13;
Drinking water facilities, roads and village electrification projects continue to be o f&#13;
urgent importance in NSP I1as many communities lack access to potable water, basic&#13;
services and markets and less than 5% o f rural households have access to power. The&#13;
unprecedented winter snowfall o f 2005 in certain provinces and the consequent flooding&#13;
caused an upsurge inprojects involving earth retaining walls and flood protection works.&#13;
The NSP I1anticipates that projects involvingroads, water and electricity will continue to&#13;
be fundamental priorities for the communities as the program rolls out to cover the entire&#13;
country. There i s a recent trend inwhich a cluster o f adjoining communities pool up o f&#13;
their block grant allocations to invest on larger and common infrastructure subprojects&#13;
such as long irrigation canals, village roads and electricity supply lines from the main&#13;
power gridto serve those cluster o fvillages. This trend i s likely to continue inthe NSP 11.&#13;
&#13;
The planning, design and implementation o f these subprojects require adequate&#13;
arrangements to ensure the design and construction quality o f the subprojects inNSP 11.&#13;
In the NSP, there have been adequate arrangements to ensure the quality of the&#13;
engineering design o f the subprojects through a systematic review o f the subprojects by&#13;
the oversight consultant. Even with these arrangements, it has been found necessary to&#13;
further improve the quality o f subprojects planningand design particularly inrespect of&#13;
micro-hydro power projects and large and common infrastructure projects that would be&#13;
implementedby a cluster o f communities usingthe pooled up block grant allocations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              97&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
While the planning and design o f the subprojects have been satisfactory, the previous&#13;
World Bank NSP review missions have expressed concerns over the inadequate&#13;
arrangements for construction quality assurance o f subprojects. Inadequate attention and&#13;
arrangements for civil works construction quality is a national issue. However,&#13;
construction quality o f subprojects cannot be compromised as nearly 88 percent of the&#13;
block grants are invested for small scale subprojects. Individual and aggregate effect o f&#13;
the poor quality would undermine both the sustainability o f the projects as well as the&#13;
expected return on the investments.&#13;
&#13;
Adequate arrangements for the construction quality assurance o f the subprojects will be&#13;
established and enforced in NSP I1as per arrangements discussed and agreed with the&#13;
MRRDas follows.&#13;
&#13;
2. QualityAssuranceof PlanningandDesignof Subprojects&#13;
&#13;
The subprojects are chosen by the communities through consensus within the CDCs.&#13;
Once the subprojects are chosen, the engineering staff o f the FPs will prepare the detailed&#13;
engineering design, drawing and bill o f quantities for the subprojects based on walk&#13;
through surveys with the communities and engineering surveys. The proposals will be&#13;
subsequently reviewed and approved by the engineers o f the regional and provincial&#13;
offices under the technical guidance o f the Engineering Department o f the NSP 11. The&#13;
NSP I1engineering department in Kabul will be headed by an internationally recruited&#13;
full time engineering expert and both the Kabul and regional offices will be adequately&#13;
staffed with local engineers, technicians andwork supervisors.&#13;
&#13;
Most o f the engineering staff employed for the NSP will continue to work inthe NSP 11,&#13;
and they will carry over the experience and skills to the NSP 11. The Technical Manual&#13;
has been revised few times and it provides engineering specifications for the range o f&#13;
typical subprojects that are adequate to guide the preparation o f the design, except for&#13;
micro hydro projects as well as the large infrastructure projects that would be&#13;
implemented by pooling up the block grant allocations by a cluster o f CDCs. These&#13;
technical guidelines are beingprepared at present.&#13;
&#13;
In order to mher improve the quality of planning and design of subprojects, the&#13;
following action are being carried out at present and supporting cost provisions have been&#13;
made inthe NSP I1proposal:&#13;
&#13;
0   A standardized checklist for design would be newly added to the current NSP&#13;
    Technical Manual as a guideline for the FP and NSP engineers and technical staff o f&#13;
    the regional andprovincialoffices;&#13;
&#13;
0   Intensive technical training will be provided to the engineering staff o f the FPs and&#13;
    regional offices on the typical subprojects o f the NSP 11, based on the Technical&#13;
    Manual and the Checklist;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            98&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    An international consultant on micro hydro power will be hired by the Engineering&#13;
    Department o f the NSP I1to guide the staff inthe planning and design o f micro hydro&#13;
    power schemes andreview and approve the proposals.&#13;
    Engineering Department will provide guidance and training to the staff o f the Rural&#13;
    Infrastructure Department o f the MRRDwho are responsible for the design and BOQ&#13;
    preparation o f the schools financed under the District School Window.&#13;
    The design skills required for large projects benefiting a cluster o f villages such as&#13;
    power supply from the main grid, micro hydro projects, and link roads etc. are usually&#13;
    beyond the capacity o f the engineering staff o f the FPs. Nevertheless, such projects&#13;
    require approval and technical review by the qualified engineering staff o f the&#13;
    respective ministries.    The Engineering Department under the guidance o f the&#13;
    international engineering expert andor micro hydro expert will take the responsibility&#13;
    for planning and design o f those large subprojects. However, it i s mandatory that&#13;
    those proposals are reviewed and approved by the concerned Ministry. The inter-&#13;
    ministerial National Steering Committee will facilitate the participation and assistance&#13;
    o f the concerned Ministry required for technical appraisal and approval o f such&#13;
    projects.&#13;
&#13;
e   The engineering and technical staff will be provided with training on environmental&#13;
    impacts o f the subprojects and incorporation o f environmental safeguards and&#13;
    mitigation measures inthe design and (construction) o f the subprojects.&#13;
    Staff o f the EngineeringDepartment will carry out spot checks in the field to review&#13;
    the appropriateness and accuracy o f subproject designs.&#13;
    Construction supervision and training on micro-hydro projects will be carried out&#13;
    under the technical guidance o f the international expert.&#13;
&#13;
3. QualityAssurance of Constructionof the Subprojects&#13;
&#13;
Inadequate construction quality o f the subprojects o f the ongoing NSP resulted due to a&#13;
number o f factors: (a) limited experience o f the engineers and technicians involved in&#13;
subprojects supervision due to inadequate exposure for construction activities inthe past&#13;
consequent to the conflict; (b) the limited number o f supervisory engineers deployed on&#13;
site, for example each district engineer is responsible for a large number o f subprojects&#13;
scattered over a large geographic area with difficult access; c) lack o f supervision&#13;
capacity by the communities; (d) the use o f inappropriate constructions techniques or&#13;
materials; and (e) inadequate job-specific hands on training provided to the staff o f the&#13;
FPs andregionaVprovincia1 offices on construction aspects.&#13;
    Basic simple quality testing equipment will be procured and distributed to the&#13;
    provincial offices and field engineering staff o f the FPs and provincial offices will be&#13;
    encouraged to use those equipment for quality control o f the construction;&#13;
    Job specific quality control training will be provided to the field engineering staff by&#13;
    the Engineering Department. This training will be provided at regionaVprovincia1&#13;
    level dependingon the availability o f facilities inthe respective province;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              99&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Job-specific basic quality management training will be provided at regional/provincial&#13;
    level to selected community members. Technical training will be included as an&#13;
    integral area for capacity building o f the communities together with the training on&#13;
    financial management, book keeping, CDC management and NSP related operational&#13;
    procedures. Use o f the simple construction quality control equipment will be a part o f&#13;
    the intendedtraining.&#13;
    The Engineering Department will train a cadre o f trainers who will in turn train the&#13;
    community members (as well as the field engineering staff).&#13;
&#13;
0   A simple, condensed, job-specific field construction management manual is being&#13;
    prepared by the Engineering Department. The manual, inter-alia, will include the&#13;
    guidelines on the selection and use o f local material for construction activities. This&#13;
    manual will be translated into local languages, with pictorial presentations o f the&#13;
    construction techniques, produced as a small handbook in local languages, and&#13;
    distributed among field staff and CDCs as a reference source. The training o f the field&#13;
    staff andcommunity members will inpart be built on this manual.&#13;
    The World Bank will review the adequacy o f the arrangements for construction&#13;
    quality management during all review missions.&#13;
&#13;
4. Specific arrangements for the Energy Sector&#13;
&#13;
After more thantwo decades o fwar inAfghanistan, the civil infrastructures are damaged&#13;
beyond repair and only a small percentage o f the population has access to irregular&#13;
electricity supply from what remains o f the national grids. Several programs have been&#13;
dealing with the rehabilitation o f the national power grid; however have so far focused&#13;
mostly on urban supply, rehabilitation o f larger plants and grid trunks, leaving the sparse&#13;
rural population completely unattended for.&#13;
&#13;
The energy sources offering better decentralization potential, sustainability,          and&#13;
reliability over time are the renewables. Renewable energy resources include hydro&#13;
(water), wind, both passive and photo voltaic solar, geothermal, processing and reuse o f&#13;
biomass and other wastes. Efficient use o f renewable resources also includes energy-&#13;
efficient architecture and demand side analysis: what types o f services do communities&#13;
demand andwhat is their willingness to pay for it.&#13;
&#13;
Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources are generally equitably distributed; almost&#13;
every community has some renewable resource available. In Afghanistan, renewable&#13;
resources are known to be good, but have not yet been systematically quantified. Rural&#13;
communities have been traditionally exploiting renewable natural resources, such as&#13;
water, to produce energy, both mechanical and electrical. More efficient and durable&#13;
technologies to harness renewable energy sources into electric power require relatively&#13;
high investments, especially wind and photo voltaic. Therefore, to foster rural&#13;
electrification and prevent excessive rural divide, consequent rampant urbanization, and&#13;
general discontent, which hamper the stability and security o f the Country, rural&#13;
communities inAfghanistan need to access appropriate technologies at reasonable cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             100&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Power Sector inNSP&#13;
&#13;
The NSP is the rural development program in Afghanistan with the most extensive&#13;
outreach; the program aims at achieving total coverage o f the Country upon completion&#13;
o f its second phase, in 2009. At the current stage 15% o f the subprojects completed or&#13;
under implementation is inthe power sector, so distributed:&#13;
&#13;
                           Sector                   Percentage&#13;
             Diesel generators                          71%&#13;
            I MHP                             I          18%           I&#13;
              Photo voltaic                              7%&#13;
              Power line extension                       3%&#13;
&#13;
The power line extension i s implemented from nearby hubs, and i s generally demanded&#13;
byperi-urbancommunities.&#13;
&#13;
Diesel generators are very expensive to operate and maintain, the rural communities have&#13;
difficulties to provide fuel regularly and undertake maintenance and replacement o f&#13;
broken parts. This has lead to a temporary suspension o f approval o f diesel generator&#13;
projects until a suitable strategy for implementation, which assures sustainability o f the&#13;
project, can be found. However, with the current crises affecting oil producing countries&#13;
the cost o f fuels is likely to keep increasing, becoming more and more unaffordable to&#13;
poor, rural communities.&#13;
&#13;
As the demand for electricity remains high among remote communities the focus has&#13;
been shifted on renewable energy technologies and communities opt principally for micro&#13;
hydro power plants. Solar or wind power solutions are chosen as alterative when the&#13;
water available is scarce or the topography is unsuitable. Solar power plants remain very&#13;
expensive; all equipments are not produced in Afghanistan and have to be imported,&#13;
therefore spare parts and technical assistance are not readily available to the communities.&#13;
Nevertheless the OC has been providing early training for Facilitating Partners, MRRD&#13;
and OC engineers working in areas where the demand for solar power is higher. In the&#13;
second phase the NSP management team will continue supporting the development o f the&#13;
sector with appropriate technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
The emphasis however will remain on Micro Hydro Power as flowing water represents&#13;
the most available and exploitable energy source o f the mountainous areas o f central and&#13;
northern Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Micro Hydro Power inNSP&#13;
&#13;
The demand for MHP currently exceeds the capacity o f the local MHP service providers&#13;
in Afghanistan. Since the start of NSP &gt;450 Micro Hydro Power (MHP) projects are&#13;
either under construction or have been built throughout 22 provinces. Prior to the launch&#13;
o f NSP, most o f the MHP projects built in the country were in 4 0 kW size range and&#13;
relied very heavily on self help contributions from the villagers. Subsequently they were&#13;
obliged to adopt low level / low cost technology and limit the size o f their installations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             101&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accordingly. Essentially they were an extension o f the traditional water mill which has&#13;
been successfully built in Afghan villages for many years. The sudden availability o f&#13;
larger amounts o f cash inthe form o fblock grants provided through NSP, however, mean&#13;
that where the water resources suffice, larger projects can be financed compared to earlier&#13;
times. The demand for rural electrification infrastructure amongst the rural communities&#13;
i s clearly of very highpriority therefore the number o f MHP projects requested is likely&#13;
to increase from the current figure.&#13;
&#13;
The quality and performance o f many o f the MHP projects implemented under NSP is&#13;
being undermined by fundamental mistakes in the design and implementation o f the&#13;
subprojects. This situation i s compounded by the current inability o f NSP to identify&#13;
these shortfalls early enough and initiate appropriate preventative action. This condition&#13;
highlights a lack of technical know-how prevalent at all levels o f the project&#13;
implementation cycle. It also indicates that the current verification mechanisms existing&#13;
withinNSP for approval o fMHPproject proposals is inadequate.&#13;
&#13;
Requirements to strengthen MHP projects and develop capacity duringNSP I1&#13;
&#13;
For sustainable implementation o f MHP projects, it i s essential that site surveys, detailed&#13;
design,     selection  o f  suitable   contractorshuppliers,     construction   supervision,&#13;
commissioning and post operation monitoring &amp; evaluation i s effectively carried out.&#13;
Unfortunately these demands currently exceed significantly the local engineering&#13;
capacity o f machinery manufacturers, facilitating partner (FP) engineers and Oversight&#13;
Consultant (OC) engineers. This has unfortunately lead to many o f the MHP projects not&#13;
fulfilling the minimumtechnical standards required to ensure their optimum performance&#13;
andlongterm sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
Provision o f the required technical assistance measures to address these shortfalls is&#13;
therefore critical to ensuring the future success o f MHP projects implemented under the&#13;
second phase o fNSP.&#13;
&#13;
The MHP Unit within the TSD&#13;
&#13;
Currently the OC engineering department possesses only 1 MHP engineer which i s&#13;
inadequate for strengthening and expanding the sector. In the foreseen NSP I1&#13;
management structure, the Technical Support Department will have to expand these&#13;
resources to create Micro Hydro Power unit integrated within the department. This unit&#13;
will comprise a full time Micro Hydro Power expert supported by a 2-4 local MHP&#13;
engineers.&#13;
&#13;
The MHP unitwill undertake the following tasks:&#13;
     Elaborate on the existing standard training modules addressing the following main&#13;
     elements o fMHP project development and implementation.&#13;
     (i) TrainingandsupervisionofFPandNSPManagementengineersinconducting&#13;
             MHP site surveys (field measurements andrelevant site data collection).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
(ii) Training and supervision of FP andNSP Management engineers inthe&#13;
       preparationo f MHP project proposals adopting suitable standardformats&#13;
(iii) Training and supervision of FP and NSP Management engineers inthe&#13;
       preparation and introduction o f sustainable MHP institutional set-ups&#13;
       addressing all aspects o f project operation and management. This will&#13;
       encompass issues relevant to additional productive end use o f energy in&#13;
       addition to domestic requirements (lighting)&#13;
&#13;
(iv)   Training and supervision o f NSP Management engineers in evaluating and&#13;
       verifying MHP project proposals received from FP's.&#13;
Provide and facilitate technical backstopping and training o f local turbine/MHP&#13;
equipment manufacturers in close cooperation with other development organizations&#13;
andNGO's engagedinthis sector.&#13;
Carry out periodic monitoring o f MHP project implementation in the respective&#13;
provinces.&#13;
Develop an appropriate mechanism to channel MHP site data relevant for projects&#13;
exceeding the size limitation o f NSP (currently 25 kW) to other potential programs&#13;
active in the MHP sector, close liaison with MRRD's Rural Electrification&#13;
Department will be developed.&#13;
Establish a proper data base management system for MHP projects implemented&#13;
under NSP to function as a monitoring and quality control function. This could be&#13;
expanded to include non-NSP projects in accordance with the requirements o f MRRD&#13;
andthe Ministryo fEnergy andWater Resources.&#13;
Establish links and foster cooperation with the Ministry o f Energy &amp; Water&#13;
Resources exploiting the potential for synergies with other programs where&#13;
appropriate.&#13;
Provide policy advice to the MRRD Rural Electrification Department to be&#13;
established specifically with the task o f coordinating small community based RE&#13;
projects falling outside the jurisdiction o fthe Ministry o f Energy &amp; Water Resources.&#13;
Develop and disseminate suitable media illustrating "best practices" relevant to the&#13;
sustainable implementation o f MHP projects to all project stakeholders. This would&#13;
encompass bothtechnical and institutional aspects o fMHP development&#13;
Revise all relevant technical literature and formats applied in the preparation,&#13;
implementation andmonitoring o f all MHP projects implementedwithin NSP.&#13;

                  APPENDIX 10: RISKASSESSMENT AND CONTROL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Countryand Sector Levelrisks&#13;
&#13;
Afghanistan continue to remain a high risk country, although there have been notable&#13;
improvements over the past years in its macro economic framework, sector policies and&#13;
institutions, political stability, and governance. Afghanistan's political transformation,&#13;
implemented according to BonnAgreement was successfully concluded inlate 2005 As a&#13;
result o f this process, Country has developed a Constitution, conducted nation wide&#13;
elections for a President and elected a Parliament and Provincial Councils.            . The Bonn&#13;
process has resulted inthe transformation from an Interim Administration to the creation&#13;
o f a representative Government.&#13;
&#13;
The President and his Cabinet formally approved the Interim Afghanistan National&#13;
Development Strategy in January 2006 which was complemented by the Afghanistan&#13;
Compact between Afghanistan and its international development partners includingIDA&#13;
andwas discussed bydonors at London conference inJanuary2006 and endorsed byUN&#13;
Security Council. It sets out detailed outcomes, benchmarks andtimelines inthe areas o f&#13;
security, governance, rule of law, humanrights, and economic and social development.&#13;
&#13;
However, notwithstanding these achievements, the normalization o f political culture and&#13;
stability still has a log way to go. Four years into Afghanistan's reconstruction process,&#13;
many challenges and risks to building institutions, sustaining growth, and reducing&#13;
poverty remain.&#13;
&#13;
Despite these challenges and risks, the overall macroeconomic framework appears&#13;
reasonably sound and illustrates the Government's                 commitment to establishing&#13;
conditions for lasting growth.l5 However, the challenges to macro economic framework&#13;
are numerous including: (i)       enhancing national security and stability;         (ii)disarming&#13;
illegally armed groups; (iii)    deepening political normalization process; (iv) phasing out&#13;
the opium economy; (iv) protecting the vulnerable segments o f the population against&#13;
detachment from the government             and shocks stemming from drought and natural&#13;
disasters etc. The Government is addressing these challenges through various fronts and&#13;
programs with the support o f external assistance o f donors. The ongoing NSP and the&#13;
proposed NSP I1 repeater operation should be seen as a complementary government&#13;
program to overcome these challenges.&#13;
&#13;
2. GovernmentCommitment&#13;
&#13;
The Government I-ANDs reflects government's strong commitment to rural areas and&#13;
endorses investments in rural development. NSP is its main vehicle to achieve most o f&#13;
the rural development sector benchmarks o f the I-ANDs. The NSP i s considered the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l5 Joint StaffAdvisory Note onAfghanistan InterimPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper, IDA and IMF, May&#13;
15,2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                108&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
flagship program o f the Government by major stakeholders supporting the state building&#13;
anddevelopment program o fthe country. It is the main instrument o f the government to&#13;
reach the rural population and deliver the much needed village level social and physical&#13;
infrastructure services. It has helped creating the Government's visibility in the rural&#13;
areas, contributed the perception that the government is taking responsibility for its&#13;
citizens, particularly in remote rural areas, and has been welcomed and accepted by the&#13;
people. The MRRD has made a commitment to bring the NSP to all rural communities&#13;
within the next three years and there is a strong demand for the program from those&#13;
communities which are yet to be reached. Thus despite the high country level risk, the&#13;
implementation o f the NSP isjustifiable. As part o f the national government, MRRD has&#13;
the political will andcommitment to roll out all areas o f the country.&#13;
&#13;
3. OperationSpecificRisks&#13;
&#13;
The ongoing NSP commenced in 2003 is a follow on operation o f the IDA financed&#13;
Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project (P077533, Grant&#13;
number H0090). The proposedproject is an emergency repeater operation o fthe ongoing&#13;
NSP.     Both o f the preceding projects were high risk and high reward operations. The&#13;
start up o f the NSP three years ago characterized a period where there was political&#13;
instability in the country, absence o f a democratically elected government, uncertain&#13;
security situation, weak institutional infrastructure, poor staff skills and capacity o f the&#13;
MFND, difficult accessibility to rural areas and weak communication infrastructure of&#13;
the country.     These factors imposed severe risks and constraints for the ongoing&#13;
operation. However, after the three years o f its operation, institutional infrastructure and&#13;
staff skills o f the MRRD have reasonably improved, and financial management,&#13;
procurement administration and M&amp;E systems and procedures for the oversight o f the&#13;
project have established andenforced.&#13;
&#13;
As development objectives o f the NSPII are the same as o f the NSP, implementation&#13;
structure and arrangements do not deviate significantly from the existing ones, and that&#13;
field tested operation manuals, operational and fiduciary supervision and monitoring&#13;
arrangements are already in place, the NSP I1will also continue to be a high-risk and&#13;
high-reward operation. It would enable the Government to roll out the program to provide&#13;
development benefits to communities that are not coveredunder the ongoing program.&#13;
&#13;
4. ProgramPlanningRisks&#13;
&#13;
The planning o f the NSP I1 implementation will be difficult in the districts and&#13;
communities where accessibility i s restricted.     One o f the main shortcomings o f the&#13;
country i s complete lack o f a village inventory and the basic socio economic census o f&#13;
the communities. In addition, there i s a continuous return and exodus o f war affected&#13;
people in and out o f the villages. These factors may pose a number o f risks for program&#13;
planning: the absence o fvillage level socio economic data mayresult is skewedtargeting&#13;
andselectiono fvillages; dynamic demographic natureo fthe villages maymake the CDC&#13;
being not representative and assessment o f number o f potential communities in a village&#13;
cumbersome and difficult; as the block grant disbursements are made on the basis ofUS$&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             109&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
200/ family, there is a risk that some villages may receive greater and some lesser than&#13;
their due block grant fund allocation. Indistricts and villages o f low to moderate security&#13;
risks, the program planningand targetingrisk is mitigated through a field verification o f&#13;
the number o f communities prior to the allocation o fblock grants. Additionally, the NSP&#13;
operation manual stipulates satisfactory measures to account for the returnees and&#13;
displaced population inthe block grant allocation and ensure election if a representative&#13;
CDC. However, with these deficiencies, it will be difficult to carry out proper planning&#13;
o f the NSP I1in security affected areas. If done there would be substantive risks o f&#13;
program planning, targeting villages and allocating block grants in a transparent and&#13;
accurate manner.&#13;
&#13;
5. Fiscal AffordabilityRisk&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry o f Finance o f the Government i s committed to expand the program to cover&#13;
the entire country over the next three years but requested only US$120 million as IDA&#13;
contribution to achieve the targets anticipating complementary funds fiom the donors.&#13;
However, there is a substantive risk that the full co-financing amount required to achieve&#13;
the expected outputs and outcomes may not be fully materialized. The estimated cost o f&#13;
the program is US$525 million o f which IDA contribution i s only US$ 120 million&#13;
(23%), while the remaining funds are expected from ARTF donors (US$ 244.4 million,&#13;
46%), JSDF (US$ 307 million, 6%) and other new donors (US$ 130.7 million, 25%). At&#13;
the project negotiations there is a financing gap o f US$ 405 million or 77% o f the&#13;
estimated cost o f the project. Although ARTF donors and JSDF are committed for the&#13;
NSP I1and will continue to provide co-financing, and a few new donors are showing&#13;
interest to join the NSP, the actual amount o f funds that will be available over the three&#13;
years i s uncertain at the time o f project appraisal. As a mitigation measure, the NSP I1&#13;
management will include an international External Relations Specialist whose primary&#13;
task will be raising co-finances for the NSP I1and ensuring the adequate and timely&#13;
availability o f funds through close coordination and collaboration with existing and&#13;
potential donors, Ministry o f Finance and the ARTF manager and Task Team o f the&#13;
World Bank. The Financing Agreement includes legal remedies to mitigate the risks&#13;
arising out o fpotential shortfalls o f funds to implement the program.&#13;
&#13;
6. ProcurementRisks&#13;
&#13;
The overall procurement risk o f the NSP i s moderate and remains to be same in the&#13;
NSPII. Several safeguards have been incorporated to the design o f the NSP I1to control&#13;
this risk At the MRRD level, the procurement administration will be overseen by an&#13;
international procurement specialist in the first year. Bank's international procurement&#13;
specialist and his team based in Kabul will continue to supervise the procurement&#13;
administration closely and carry out post-procurement reviews periodically. However,&#13;
the project includes a large number o f community level subprojects that are widely&#13;
spread over remote villages and will be procured the communities. Consequently, there&#13;
i s a moderate risk that communities may not adhere to the agreed community practices&#13;
and Bank would be unable to carry out procurement reviews o f a reasonable sample o f&#13;
subprojects as ina normal investment project. But NSP operation manual provides step&#13;
by step procedures to be followed by the communities. The project will continue to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               110&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
provide training on community procurement to FP staff and CDCs, particularly to&#13;
members o f the procurement subcommittees o f CDCs. To mitigate the risk further, the&#13;
NSP I1includes institutional arrangements to carry out social auditing o f procurements at&#13;
the CDC level to enforce additional checks and balances and transparency in the&#13;
community procurement process. The information related to procurement under block&#13;
grants will be disseminated to the public inthe notice boards o f the village mosque, CDC&#13;
office and NSP website. In addition the information i s disclosed at large gathering o f&#13;
villagers at meetings as per the current practice under NSP.&#13;
&#13;
7. FinancialManagement Risks&#13;
&#13;
Project financial management risk and associated perceived corruption risk are rated&#13;
"high". There are several measures incorporated to the project designto control the risks&#13;
including: outsourcing o f financial management and Block Grant disbursement&#13;
management to an international Management Support Consultant firm; minimized use o f&#13;
the designated account; direct payment to Consultants to the extent possible; supervision&#13;
o f procurement by an international procurement advisor; creation o f a Controller's unit&#13;
within the MRRD to carry out independent internal audits and facilitate external audits;&#13;
andtechnical and financial auditing o f the contracts o f Management Support Consultant&#13;
and24 FPs.&#13;
&#13;
8. Safeguard Compliance Risks&#13;
&#13;
The environmental and social safeguard compliance o f the ongoing NSP has been rated&#13;
unsatisfactory during last review mission and therefore is a highrisk. Although the NSP&#13;
operation manual includes clear guidelines and processes to comply with safeguards, the&#13;
unsatisfactory safeguard compliance i s consequent to absence o f designated safeguard&#13;
staff in the MRRD/OC project management structure. To mitigate the risk, the NSP I1&#13;
design includes provisions to hire a designated Safeguards Nodal Officer who will have&#13;
overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation o f the Environmental and Social&#13;
Safeguards Framework and Management Plan. He/she will be assisted by designated&#13;
staff inMRRD's provincial offices. Bank will provide orientation training to these staff&#13;
from time to time to improve their capacity to carry out social and safeguard measures.&#13;
Inaddition, training on environmental andsocial safeguard compliance will be addedto&#13;
the training curricula for FP staff and community members andnecessary training will be&#13;
provided to them bythe Safeguard Nodal officer an his staff.&#13;
&#13;
9. Risksof Sustainability of CDCs&#13;
&#13;
The Government believes that CDCs can play three important roles in the bigger picture&#13;
o f Afghanistan's longer-term development. First, CDC's for the first time provide the&#13;
central government with an effective means and interface to deliver basic services across&#13;
the entire country.       Second, CDC's could potentially carry out certain basic&#13;
administrative functions provided that they received a core block grant through the&#13;
government budget. Third, CDC's could be grouped to provide representative planning&#13;
bodies at the district level that would advise local government. These three options to a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             111&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
large extent hinge on the central government's vision for sub-national government and&#13;
administration. A more sustained role for CDC's would be equally compatible with&#13;
continued centralization or in a more deconcentrated system. With these fbture goals in&#13;
view, the Government has drafted a CDC by-law as an initial step to lay foundation&#13;
toward to nurture and formalize the CDCs.        The draft-by law needs to be approved by&#13;
the President and it i s expected the National Steering Committee chaired by the Vice&#13;
President would take the lead in processing the draft by-laws and follow up actions. In&#13;
the long runs, the MRRD expects to draft CDC constitution to be approved by the&#13;
Parliament to provide legal status to CDCs. Before Credit Effectiveness, the donors and&#13;
IDA would agree with the Government for a time bound action planto complete these&#13;
short-term and long-term tasks. External Donor Review Committee will closely monitor&#13;
the progress duringthe implementationphase.&#13;
&#13;
IT should benoted the design o fNSP I1itselfincludes several measures to mitigate these&#13;
sustainability risks. The CDD nature o f the project makes the decision making, planning&#13;
and implementation o f the subprojects using the block grant investments more&#13;
transparent, accountable and equitable. Democratic election o f the CDCs supported with&#13;
coaching, mentoring and trainingof the CDC members are key measures that help lay the&#13;
foundation for sustainable decision making and participation o f the rural communities in&#13;
village level matters. The leadership andparticipation o f the CDCs inthe implementation&#13;
o f the subprojects improve the village level ownership o f the physical assets created and&#13;
rehabilitated by the project and enhance the chance o f sustainable post project O&amp;M&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
10. Risks of Sustainability of Subprojects&#13;
&#13;
The NSP implementation revealed several risks on the sustainability o f the subprojects&#13;
mainly due to deficiencies in construction quality o f the subprojects and shortcomings in&#13;
the design o f rural electrification subprojects. Deficiencies in construction quality arose&#13;
consequent to lack o f capacity o f technical staff and quality testing facilities, and wide&#13;
geographic spread and remoteness o f villages that demanded heavy technical supervision&#13;
inputs. Adequate measures have been incorporated in the NSP I1to mitigate this risk&#13;
including: providing an international micro-hydro power expert within the Technical&#13;
Department to guide and review designs o f rural electrification subprojects; preparing a&#13;
hands-on basic construction management manual in local languages to be used by the&#13;
field staff and communities; training o f community members and field staff on O&amp;M and&#13;
construction using the manual as the primary reference source; procuring simple&#13;
construction quality control equipment and deploying those in provinces; exposure and&#13;
on-the job overseas and in-country training to MRRD and FP supervisory staff. Details&#13;
are inAppendix 8.&#13;
&#13;
11. Security Risks&#13;
&#13;
The NSP has been implemented under severe security risks in some areas. Despite the&#13;
security risks, the implementation o f the NSP proved that a community driven&#13;
development operation such as NSP could be effectively implemented. However, over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             112&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the past months, the security situation has seriously deteriorated in some parts o f the&#13;
country, particularly inthe South, to the extent that the project operation inthose districts&#13;
will not only be difficult but also highly risky in many respects. Also the NSP has&#13;
remained a high-risk, but high visibility and high reward project achieving its&#13;
development objectives.&#13;
&#13;
Marked presence o f the organized anti-government elements and have resulted in&#13;
increased violence in some districts/provinces. Consequently, the accessibility o f the&#13;
project facilitating partners and the government staff to some provinces/disticts to plan,&#13;
implement and monitor the project is severely restricted.         As o f Sep 18, 2006, the&#13;
ongoing NSP has been suspended fully in 26 districts and partially in 4 districts in 13&#13;
provinces out o f the 34 provinces o f the country. This has caused the suspension o f&#13;
community mobilization and subproject implementation in nearly 1,536 communities,&#13;
which i s about 9 percent o f the 17,000 communities reached by the project to date.      In&#13;
those districts the security situation remains volatile andunpredictable and the number o f&#13;
districts affected by the security threats appears to be on the increasing side.        It is&#13;
impossible to roll out the program inthose districts unless the security situation becomes&#13;
easedoff.&#13;
&#13;
The restricted accessibility to the communities in the insecure villages and&#13;
districts/provinces would pose a number o f operational, fiduciary andreputation risks and&#13;
has direct negative consequences for achieving the development effectiveness and&#13;
outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Any compromise on the quality o f facilitation will jeopardize the development&#13;
effectiveness o f the project in high risk areas. The escalating security situation would&#13;
seriously erode the sustainability o f CDCs and subprojects in some communities unless&#13;
adequate community facilitation, engineering and fiduciary supervision and monitoring&#13;
can be carried out. In the absence o f adequate planning, supervision and monitoring,&#13;
there i s also a reputational risk to government and donors that that the project would&#13;
create avenues or corruption and funds can be leaked to anti-government elements who&#13;
are inconflict with democratically elected government financing the project.   .&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, it has been agreed that the project, through the National Steering Committee,&#13;
will obtain guidance for program planning and implementation in the high risk areas,&#13;
particularly for the roll out to new communities and new districts. If the accessibility o f&#13;
these villages and districts are restricted, the program roll out to new communities and&#13;
new districts will not take place until the Steering Committee recommends that the&#13;
security situation has eased off, the concerned Communities are willing to receive the&#13;
services o f FPs, the concerned FP and the staff o f the Regional staff are willing to travel&#13;
to those areas.&#13;
&#13;
However, in the case o f communities in high risk areas who have been partially&#13;
mobilized and already included in the ongoing FP contracts, a different distance based&#13;
approach will be utilized. Ifin any village, ifthe CDC is already inplace, CDP has been&#13;
developed and subprojects have been approved by the OC, then the CDC will allow to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             113&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
proceed with the implementation. In those instances, the sub-project implementation&#13;
would rely on trusted and respected independent community members, who could verify&#13;
the use of block grant funds and the status of implementation. In addition, the project&#13;
implementation will rely upon the monitoring by community level procurement and&#13;
financial management sub-committees. However, technically complex sub-proj ects, such&#13;
as micro-hydro power, would not be implemented in the absence o f proper technical&#13;
support.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the initial implementation experience with this proxy oversight are monitoring&#13;
arrangements, other possible alternative implementation approaches would be explored&#13;
later duringthe implementationphase.&#13;

                ANNEX 11: THE OPIUM PROBLEMAND THE NSPI1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. The OpiumProblem&#13;
&#13;
Reducing opium production is one o f the greatest challenges facing Afghanistan. Opium&#13;
i s central to the macroeconomy, contributing one third o f GDP and significant support for&#13;
aggregate demand and the balance o f payments. Inthe rural economy, opium is a key&#13;
livelihoods coping strategy for as many as 350,000 farm families, most o f them poor. In&#13;
the area o f security, opium is helling warlordism and terrorism, and ingovernance the&#13;
illegal economy is capturing or undermining state buildingefforts at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
2. Governmentstrategy&#13;
&#13;
Government's strategy to reduce and ultimately eliminate opium from the Afghan&#13;
economy comprises essentially three elements. The first i s to improve governance and&#13;
the rule o f law, strengthening public institutions and mechanisms to control drugs,&#13;
together with the development o f responsible governance structures and the "social&#13;
contract" at all levels from the community up. The second is to raise the general level o f&#13;
economic activity and services, improving living standards and providing social&#13;
protection. The third i s to emphasize indevelopment programs specific components that&#13;
can have a significant impact on farmer behavior, with a focus on poorer farmers,&#13;
laborers, andmore vulnerable areas.&#13;
&#13;
3. World Bankapproach&#13;
&#13;
Withthis background, the World Bank's working approach to the opium problem is:&#13;
&#13;
         to factor considerations o f the opium problem into analysis and dialogue at all&#13;
         levels, including the macroeconomic dimension&#13;
     0   to support and engage in analytical work on the development dimensions o f the&#13;
         drugprobleminAfghanistanandassociated options for addressing it&#13;
         to help support the development elements o f the Government's strategy through&#13;
         Bank-financed programs as appropriate&#13;
     0   to ensure that the activities supported by the Bank do not inadvertently contribute&#13;
         inanyway to the opium economy&#13;
&#13;
The Bank screens all its activities in Afghanistan, both operations and analytical and&#13;
advisory work, to ensure that counter-narcotics aspects are treated consistently and in a&#13;
way that can make the maximum contribution to the national effort against drugs.&#13;
&#13;
4. NSPcontributionto the counter-narcoticsstrategy&#13;
&#13;
Given the scale and nature o f the opium problem inAfghanistan it i s recognized that the&#13;
illicit drugs issue cannot be dealt with in isolation from the wider state building and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              115&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development process. While no single project or program can address the myriad&#13;
motivations and factors that influence opium poppy cultivation, the elimination o f opium&#13;
production will be dependent on the achievement o f broader development goals,&#13;
including establishing the institutions required for formal governance andpromoting civil&#13;
society, strengthening social protection mechanisms, as well as encouraging licit on-farm,&#13;
o f f - f m and non-fam income opportunities. The NSP is expected to contribute&#13;
significantly to manyo f those broader goals, ifnot all.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, however, the there is the potential risk o f promoting conditions that&#13;
could benefit the illicit economy. The implementation arrangements and the design o f the&#13;
program for the phase I1have tried to keep these aspects in consideration, and a series o f&#13;
mitigation measures have been discussed and agreed with the government to avoid&#13;
potential negative effects.&#13;
&#13;
Potential benefits&#13;
&#13;
The NSP aims to lay the'foundations for a strengthening o f community level governance,&#13;
and to support community-managed subprojects comprising reconstruction and&#13;
development that improve access o f rural communities to social and productive&#13;
infrastructure and services. Reaching out to virtually all villages, the NSP will positively&#13;
contribute to the counter-narcotics strategy:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0    By contributing to the governance agenda, establishing democratically elected&#13;
          councils, promoting a culture o f conflict resolutions, and mitigating the power&#13;
          structures at the local level;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0   Through the community planning and the rehabilitation and building o f essential&#13;
          rural infrastructure, the NSP maximizes synergies with other income oriented&#13;
          projects to deliver broad livelihoods impacts at the community and household&#13;
          level;&#13;
&#13;
          By aiming to reach out to virtually every village in the country, the NSP is the&#13;
          most effective instrument currently available to promote the support o f the&#13;
          government in the rural areas, where most o f the poor live, and particularly in&#13;
          remote areas where opium poppy cultivation is becoming increasingly&#13;
          concentrated. The program positively develop responsible reciprocity between&#13;
          rural communities and the state. The spread o f efficient andresponsive delivery o f&#13;
          infrastructure and services, and the development of counterpart community&#13;
          structures like the CDCs, increase respect for the Government's development&#13;
          capability, build responsible local community social capital, and open paths for&#13;
          dialogue on the drugs issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0   The wealth o f data collected through the NSP allows to effectively contribute in&#13;
          the understanding o f the dynamics in rural areas, and to potentially elaborate&#13;
          information that is not available through regular statistics, including the trends o f&#13;
          the opium economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              116&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       The poorest will benefit duringthe construction period from increased wage labor&#13;
       opportunities, and also from labor opportunities o f more intensified production&#13;
       after rehabilitation (although most employment will probably be for family labor)&#13;
&#13;
       Improved rural roads, culverts, bridges and other infrastructure will help reduce&#13;
       the isolation o f the most remote villages, which inturn will make more apparent&#13;
       illicit cultivations.&#13;
&#13;
Potentialrisks&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, the very samebenefits promotedbythe program canposeindirect risks&#13;
to a successful implementation o f a counter-narcotics agenda:&#13;
&#13;
       There is some risk that a move out o f opium on NSP areas could reduce share&#13;
       cropping opportunities, labor requirements and wage rates, reducing economic&#13;
       opportunities for poorer and landless farmers. This however should be offset by&#13;
       other    economic     opportunities   promoted   through    community     planning,&#13;
       infrastructure investments, and synergies with other local projects.&#13;
&#13;
    0  Opiumproducing areas are also the most insecure, and where the NSP will have&#13;
       to consider alternative implementation strategies. There is a risk that ifmonitoring&#13;
       inthese areas due to the security conditions is not sufficiently close, block grants&#13;
       could be appropriatedor their use controlled by druglords.&#13;
Agreed measures:&#13;
&#13;
A number o f measures have been agreed to maximize positive impact or mitigate risks&#13;
from a counter-narcotics perspective. These are expected to become part o f the day-to&#13;
day operations, to be reflected in the operational manual, and to be monitored during&#13;
regular supervision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Link CDCs mobilization to support agriculture services (extension, inputs,&#13;
       markets) that will allow farmers to adopt a non-opium cropping pattern. While&#13;
       subprojects financed under the NSP are public-good oriented, the mobilization&#13;
       process can easily incorporate elements o f additional support services wherever&#13;
       they are possible inthe community plan.&#13;
&#13;
    0  Linkirrigation communityprojectswithother operations. Farmers' incomes could&#13;
       be much more rapidly improved if more reliable water supplies formed part o f a&#13;
       "package" of measures to improve productivity and profitability through other&#13;
       projects, including the Bank financed HLP (Horticulture and Livestock Project,&#13;
       P098256). Particularly important are the advice, planting materials and market&#13;
       outlets to allow farmers to switch to higher value crops.&#13;
&#13;
    0  Promote access to credit for licit cropping. NSP should: (i) partnerships in&#13;
                                                                      form&#13;
       each area with the MAAH extension services and with any NGO or other donor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             117&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
projects that can provide support services; (ii) with MAAHwhether there&#13;
                                                discuss&#13;
would be value added in a national framework agreement to cooperate on the&#13;
provision o f farmer support services; and (ii) form an alliance with MISFA and&#13;
the M F I s at provincial and local level to broaden access to production and&#13;
equipment credit andto promote development o f agro-processing.&#13;
&#13;
Maximize the use o f direct contracting and o f communitv labor, and timingworks&#13;
inpoppy producing or poppy vulnerable areas at times ofpeak labor demand for&#13;
poppy. For example, works inNangarhar and Helmand might be concentrated in&#13;
the period February to May, and those in Badakhshan in M a y to July&#13;
(corresponding with harvest time).&#13;
&#13;
Any activity that supports drugcultivation andprocessing is on the NSP Negative&#13;
List (NSP OM section 1). The activity, most likely to support poppy cultivation, i s&#13;
irrigation rehabilitation and development inpoppy-producing regions. Ifa CDC in&#13;
a poppy-producing area proposes an irrigation subproject, the optiodrisk that the&#13;
water is used for poppy cultivation must be discussed; andthe CDC must confirm&#13;
that drug crop cultivation will not take place in the area benefiting from the&#13;
project. This agreement must be documented in the Tripartite Agreement&#13;
(Disbursement Form 8) and Subproject Proposal (Disbursement Form 7).&#13;
&#13;
Use the NSP communication unit (PCU) to deliver messages aligned with the&#13;
counter-narcotics strategv. The NSP communication unit reaches out to all rural&#13;
Afghanistan through radio programs and other means. The NSP/PCU should&#13;
coordinate with the Ministry o f Counter-Narcotics to identify the key messages to&#13;
be incorporated intheir communications to the rural communities.&#13;
&#13;
Propose components o f the NSP program for Counter-narcotics Trust Fund&#13;
financing: at the 2006 London Conference, a total o f $80 million was pledged to&#13;
the Counter-narcotics Trust Fund (CNTF) by a range o f donors. The CNTF&#13;
criteria give priority to projects in opium producing or vulnerable areas, and to&#13;
projects which support the "mainstreaming" o f counter narcotics objectives within&#13;
institutions and programs. CNTF financing can provide extra resources and set a&#13;
positive the example. Financing a major national program like the NSP would&#13;
help CNTF to focus on mainstreamprograms with broad impact rather than on the&#13;
kindo fmyriadmicro-projects considered up to now.&#13;

                 APPENDIX 12: COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Since September 2003,         the Oversight Consultant (OC)         established a Public&#13;
Communication Unit (PCU) to raise awareness about the program's objectives and to&#13;
communicate the program's success, primarilyto Afghans. The execution o f this strategy&#13;
will fiather assist the NSP and MRRDinachieving their objectives and inensuring that&#13;
the communication and information function properly adapts to the evolving needs o f the&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
This strategy is consistent with, and aims to achieve objectives o f the government and its&#13;
commitments as expressed in the Interim Afghan National Development Strategy (I-&#13;
ANDs). This strategy was developed in consultation with representatives o f MRRD,&#13;
FacilitatingPartners (FPs), the CDCs andthe UN,andthe World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
2. Rationale&#13;
&#13;
At the heart o f the National Solidarity Program is a human growth, empowerment and&#13;
local governance process, based to a great extent on social, economic and political&#13;
change. This change is dependent on several factors including the systematic access to&#13;
knowledge and information by all stakeholders. Hence, strategic communication provides&#13;
NSP I1 management with supporting tools for the achievement o f the program&#13;
development objectives;     it helps facilitate a common understanding among all&#13;
participants, therefore creating a base for concerted action.&#13;
&#13;
Undertaking a carefully considered communication program, to build public consensus&#13;
and ownership o f the program remains an important element for the success o f the NSP&#13;
11.To the government's credit, significant communication activities are already ongoing&#13;
at national level. The government capacity to engage in communication during the first&#13;
three years o f NSP implementation has been admirable. As the program moves into its&#13;
second phase it's important to ensure that communication activities carried out by PCU&#13;
are sustained as a two -way communication mechanism that includes adequate feedback&#13;
from key constituencies.&#13;
&#13;
3. Background&#13;
&#13;
As o f December 2005, PCU produced about 4 hours o f broadcast TV news, 15 hours of&#13;
documentaries, 100 hours o f radio broadcast divided in features stories, news and soap&#13;
opera episodes. It produced about 75,000 print media products (posters, brochures&#13;
leaflets, poem books and news articles), eight exposure trips, and one national CDC&#13;
congress. The total cost estimated o f the PCU i s about US$1.2 million a year. P C U&#13;
current activities include daily five-minute radio and television news bulletins, a daily&#13;
radio drama "Let's BuildOur Village," occasional TV documentaries and features, and a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             119&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
variety o f print products promoting NSP and the radio drama.            Most products are&#13;
publishedinDari, Pashto and English.&#13;
&#13;
4. Environmentanalysis&#13;
&#13;
The NSP public environment i s varied and complex. Each audience receives information&#13;
indifferent ways andviewsthe activities ofNSP through different lenses:&#13;
&#13;
Afghan population. The Afghan population is widely dispersed and predominantly&#13;
rural, with a rich and varied culture.      Communication activities must consider local&#13;
language, cultural, religious, tribal, and gender norms. Inbroad terms, 50% speak Dari&#13;
and35% speak Pashto. Ethnic groups include Pashtun (42%), Tajik (27%), Hazara (9%),&#13;
Uzbec (9%), Aimak (4%), Turkmen (3%) and Baloch (2%). The predominant religions&#13;
are Sunni Muslim (84%) and Shi'a Muslim (15%). News travels most often by word o f&#13;
mouth inperson and often at the mosques, or by cell phone, significantly aided by radio&#13;
news programming. Radio ownership is estimated at 83% and television ownership at&#13;
37%. Television access i s increasing as electrification branches out from the major cities&#13;
and i s quite popular, but power i s usually limited to a few hours a day.            Internet&#13;
availability i s estimated at 6%. Newspapers are rarely available outside o f provincial and&#13;
district capitals andmost are perceived to have political bias. The national literacy rate i s&#13;
estimated at 37% for men and 10% for women, lower in rural Afghanistan. Afghans&#13;
prefer to listen to dramas ahead o f other programming options. Afghanwomen have less&#13;
access to radio than men, even if the radio is within their own homes, thus half o f the&#13;
population have little to no access to government communication. More detailed media&#13;
analysis i s available in the publication Afghan Media - Three Years After produced in&#13;
May 2005 by USAID with research by Altai consulting. Surveys indicate a high level o f&#13;
awareness and interest in the radio programs. Media reports and personal commentary&#13;
indicate that those in locations o f renewed violence have little trust inthe GIRA's ability&#13;
to serve their needs, due not only to the violence but also the low rate o f reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
Community Development Councils.Members of the CDCs receive the bulk o f NSP&#13;
information from the contracted FPs. Like other Afghans they may listen to NSP news&#13;
anddrama broadcasts. Some CDC members have conducted exchanges with other CDCs&#13;
to share experiences. FPs report that CDCs view the NSP as a government-led program,&#13;
and are appreciative o f the structure, organization and focus it has given to their&#13;
communities, and believe funding delays are a government problem to solve. Several&#13;
communities use the council to focus volunteer work and to solve local issues. The NSP&#13;
projects are a tool through which they can learn the value o f elections, consultations, and&#13;
project and money management. CDCs offer a mechanism o f consultation and program&#13;
delivery at the village level. CDCs have engaged district and provincial government&#13;
representatives to address village issues, but are hampered by the belief that those higher&#13;
levels CDCs are just part o f a program, and not a form o f governance. Some CDCs are&#13;
losing trust ingovernment to satisfy their needs particularly inthe less secure areas o f the&#13;
country, due inpart to the disbursement delays andthe low rate o f reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             120&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Facilitating Partners (FPs). The MRRD has contracted twenty-four national and&#13;
international Non-Governmental Organizations and 1UNAgency (UN-Habitat) to work&#13;
with communities to implement NSP. FP agencies employ Afghans to work directly with&#13;
the community, and typically they are from the geographical area they support. FPs&#13;
communicate strongly within their organizations, primarily over the phone.                FPs&#13;
communicate with their CDCs primarily in person, and have often started the&#13;
communication process through existing local leaders.           FPs at the national level&#13;
participate in a monthly NSP-led meeting, yet saw the need to elect a representative&#13;
group to bringtheir concerns to the NSP. FPs also participate in a weekly meeting at the&#13;
provincial level with the OC andMRRD. An NSP PCU survey indicates that FPs believe&#13;
the current NSP PCUproducts are valuable tools to communicate NSP principles to rural&#13;
communities, particularly when FPs are not able to be in location for security reasons.&#13;
They encourage the development o f TV programs, and strongly recommend the&#13;
continued use o f radio programming to reach all audiences. FPs stress the need for all&#13;
messaging to be inline with the principles o f NSP, MRRD and the ANDs, and to ensure&#13;
the drama is in tune with the culture; otherwise, the people will tune out.            FPs are&#13;
concerned that the governance value o f the NSP is lost inthe focus on project targets, and&#13;
that project quality standards demanded by the international community are not realistic,&#13;
and impose unnecessary delays that affect community governance development.&#13;
&#13;
International community. The international community receives the bulk o f its&#13;
information from English-language media via the internet, TV and print coverage in&#13;
Afghanistan, and through briefings at international conferences.          The international&#13;
community sees the NSP as a success yet remain concerned about funding and&#13;
disbursement transparency and accountability. The website front pages o f most&#13;
international aid agencies indicate that Afghanistan aid is not at the top o f their global aid&#13;
agenda. Specific audiences the NSP must consider include Afghan embassies o f donor&#13;
countries, the World Bank,the UNDP andNATO.&#13;
&#13;
Media. National media are concentrated in Kabul, with radio and print agencies in all&#13;
provinces. Television has a strong broadcast presence inmost urbancenters and there are&#13;
many print agencies in Kabul. Many national private radio and television agencies air&#13;
NSP products for free as they are professionally produced and are provided consistently.&#13;
NSP pays the government-owned Radio and Television Afghanistan (RTA) to air its&#13;
products. NSP should also consider relationshipswith BBC (local language) andborder-&#13;
country media who broadcasts reach into Afghanistan. Media generally have few&#13;
resources and little training; however, they are steadily buildingtheir industry. They are&#13;
skeptical o f government communication, having been saturated with propaganda in the&#13;
past. Reporters receive information best in person from local authority figures and by&#13;
cell phone. Foreign media representatives inAfghanistan are generally aware o fNSP and&#13;
its successes but do not track its efforts. Media mainly cover security and corruption&#13;
issues, and have reported on the decline in international funding for reconstruction in&#13;
Afghanistan. The presence o f foreign media in Kabul i s steadily declining; however,&#13;
they are increasinglyhiringlocalAfghansjournalists to feed news to their agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            121&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Government Ministries. The Second Vice-president chairs an inter-ministerial steering&#13;
committee on NSP, established for policy advice and coordination comprising several&#13;
ministries. Public communication on NSP are not coordinated through this committee.&#13;
Ministries compete for resources allocated to MRRD and NSP, and view NSP as a&#13;
project-focused entity. Valuable collaborative work is taking place with the ministries o f&#13;
Health and Education.     Other key ministries should include Agriculture, Energy and&#13;
Water andthe Ministryo fthe Interior.&#13;
&#13;
MRRD. The MRRD has contracted the German Technical Cooperation Corporation&#13;
(GTZ) to provide NSP programmed oversight, which established the NSP PCU. MRRD&#13;
also has a communication unit at the MRRD level that works inthe same facility as NSP&#13;
PCU, but does not coordinate activities, messaging or resources. There is no formalized&#13;
internal information program at MRRD.Regular meetings have been established to foster&#13;
two-way communication and conferences are every three months to bring provincial&#13;
representatives to Kabul for discussions. Policies are also communicated by e-mail and&#13;
by post. Provincial RRDs conduct weekly meetings with the OC and the facilitating&#13;
partners. MRRD and OC offices are not always co-located.&#13;
&#13;
5. Aim&#13;
&#13;
The NSP I1communication strategy aims at improving the cost-efficiency and impact o f&#13;
the PCU activities. It i s based on the findings and recommendations provided by the&#13;
baseline assessment according to the following framework: (i)Communication to&#13;
enhance projects effectiveness and achieve the intended operational results, (ii)&#13;
Communication for education, learning and dissemination o f information to large&#13;
audiences, (iii)Communication for relationship and coalition building, social and&#13;
political mobilization, donors relations andinstitutional strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
6. Objectives&#13;
&#13;
The NSP I1communication objectives stem from the program operational needs as well&#13;
as the ANDs, the GIRA and MRRD:&#13;
(i)TobuildtrustandconfidenceintheGIRAandincreaseGIRAvisibilitythrough&#13;
      sustained support to Community Development Councils.&#13;
(ii)TouniteministriesbehindsharedsuccessesofCommunityDevelopmentCouncils.&#13;
(iii)To encourage continuedfinancial, human,andtechnical support for Community&#13;
      Development Councils.&#13;
(iv) To communicate the potential o f Community Development Councils as the first&#13;
      level o f governance.&#13;
(v) To create the conditions for awareness, interest, comprehension and acceptance of&#13;
      the instrumental role that women play incommunity growth anddevelopment.&#13;
(vi) To enhance projects effectiveness and achieve the intended operational results&#13;
      through the strategic use o f communication tools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            122&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7. Criticalassumptions&#13;
&#13;
The role o f communication planning in NSP I1 has significantly broadened. While&#13;
ensuring that key messages about the program design and impacts are widely&#13;
disseminated and clearly understood remains an important aim, other factors such as&#13;
building trust, facilitating dialog among all stakeholders, donors and other key actors&#13;
have come to the forefront o f the NSP I1communication needs. This implies that the&#13;
objectives above will be achieved by setting up a two-way communication mechanism&#13;
that goes beyond informationdissemination.&#13;
&#13;
During NSP I,PCU's communication focused primarily on information campaigns&#13;
following the Information, Education and Communication (IEC) 16 approach. NSP I1&#13;
communication strategy adds a Development Communication (Devcom) 17 , an&#13;
institutional strengthening18 and an advocacy19 approach to the existing IEC model.&#13;
This array of communication approaches, supported by a solid M&amp;E component will&#13;
ensure that PCU communication function is strategic, geared to operational goals,&#13;
coherent andinline with the broader ANDs andMRRDobjectives.&#13;
&#13;
8. Key Messages&#13;
&#13;
Messages should be regularly reviewed to ensure consistency with the MRRD strategic&#13;
plan and supporting programs. These messages will be interpreted into Dari andPashto to&#13;
reflect cultural nuances and sensitivities yet remain consistent in meaning. These&#13;
messages will only be effective as long as they are true and supportedby action.&#13;
&#13;
     0    Through the Community Development Councils, the people of Afghanistan&#13;
          are cultivating a healthy Afghanistan throughout Afghanistan according to&#13;
          their sharedvision, values, anddemocratically-deteninedpriorities.&#13;
&#13;
          Community Development Councils are our first level of governance. By&#13;
          supporting the Community Development Council your voice rebuilds your&#13;
          village, reconstructs your province andunifies your nation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16 This approach refers to a set activities aimed to disseminate information to large audiences. It is based&#13;
on the linear model o f transmission where the information is disseminated through a number o f media,&#13;
often identifiable with mass-media.&#13;
17Development Communication (Devcom) approach which looks at how to use communication tools to&#13;
enhance projects effectiveness and achieve the intended operational results (grassroots activities and&#13;
coordination withFPs)&#13;
18 The institutional strengthening component aims at supporting the information flow among key&#13;
institutional actors involved in the program, (inter ministerial committee, donors, MRRD central and&#13;
regional offices, implementing agencies, FPs) coordinating the management o f information system, while&#13;
supporting transparency and accountability.&#13;
19Advocacy i s intended as those activities aimed at promoting awareness of certain issues (CDCs as a&#13;
successful development model to be exploited) to support policy-malung either addressing themdirectly or&#13;
addressing the broader public opinion.&#13;

9. Primaryaudiences&#13;
&#13;
Audience A: InstitutionsDirectlyInvolvedin the Projectas Partners.All institutions&#13;
participating inNSP I1will be involved inthe communication program andprovided with&#13;
adequate and timely information to ensure good coordination and the sharing o f a clear&#13;
and comprehensive understanding. In addition to the MRRD, these institutions include:&#13;
the inter ministerial committee, the FPs and all other implementing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
Audience B: General Public in Afghanistan. The majority of the citizens of&#13;
Afghanistan have heard about NSP and /or about the ongoing rural reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation process. On the one handthey pinmany hopes on it, but on the other hand&#13;
they are loosing confidence inthe government capacity to satisfy their needs, particularly&#13;
inthe less secure areas ofthe country.&#13;
&#13;
Audience C: CDC members and project area residents. CDC members and project&#13;
area residents are those people who are resident in the villages that are directly or&#13;
indirectly involvedwith NSP I1projects.&#13;
&#13;
Audience D:InternationalCommunity.The NSPI1is closely monitored and supported&#13;
by many bilateral and multilateral agencies. It is important to ensure transparency and&#13;
accountability, and to provide these institutions with timely and accurate information.&#13;
&#13;
10. IntermediateAudiences&#13;
&#13;
  0 Local authorities and localpower elite&#13;
&#13;
     Development agencies, civil society associations and NGOs&#13;
They include: the development agencies working in Afghanistan, opinion leaders,&#13;
religious groups and community leaders. These institutions can provide valuable&#13;
information and feedback on project activities, and can be partners in the information&#13;
dissemination process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             124&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Themass media.&#13;
Interaction with the mass media, (printed press, radio and TV) will be essential to reach&#13;
the general public and gain public support.&#13;
&#13;
The NSP I1will establish a system ensuring that all the stakeholders share the same&#13;
information and knowledge, exchange their views, discuss the different aspects o f the&#13;
project and share a common understanding o f the project's objectives, and follow a&#13;
unifiedapproach to communication that allows them to disseminate uniformandcoherent&#13;
information;&#13;
&#13;
Under NSP I1the PCU will regularly provide correct information to the general public&#13;
about the progress o f the NSP 11, its benefits and potential impacts, and the role o f the&#13;
different involved organizations (government, donors, contractors etc.). It will also&#13;
regularly gather concerns and suggestions from the general public for consideration by&#13;
decision-makers, and identify and address specific misinformation and misperceptions&#13;
concerning the NSP 11.&#13;
&#13;
11. Key activities&#13;
&#13;
The activities that follow will reach specific audiences to accomplish the objectives (see&#13;
also Annex A for details):&#13;
&#13;
Internalcommunication. Strong internal communication will support operations, build&#13;
teamwork and a sense o f shared mission, and lead to consistent external communication.&#13;
Communication can include E-mail, Ministerial visits to national and field offices,&#13;
conferences and staff meetings. Most meetings should facilitate two-way communication,&#13;
and minutes should be taken so that timely action can follow. Meetings should facilitate&#13;
the input o f participants o f different languages, culture, gender and areas o f&#13;
responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic government communication. As the                  GIRA develops      a strategic&#13;
communication capability, MRRDmust participate to ensure consistent government-wide&#13;
communication on NSP and other government activities and issues.                   Strategic&#13;
communication can include planning, presidential speeches, and ministerial visits to&#13;
foreign countries to educate them on the current success and hture potential o f the&#13;
community development councils.&#13;
&#13;
News bulletins. PCU produces radio and TV news bulletins on NSP activities for&#13;
broadcasting by RTA and almost all private Afghan agencies. The PCU should also&#13;
negotiate broadcasting by border-country media agencies to better reach border rural&#13;
villages. Coverage should include the start or completion o f projects, election processes,&#13;
and wherever CDCs have demonstrated proactively and creativity in resolving local&#13;
issues. News bulletins should also explain funding delays and changes to project policy.&#13;
PCU should consider a weekly rather than a daily news bulletin and include other MRRD&#13;
program information-this would necessitate the migration o f news production capability&#13;
from the NSP to the MRRDlevel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             125&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Donor coordination and Public Relations: a selected candidate with excellent&#13;
interpersonal communication skills, sensitivity and good diplomatic manner in dealing&#13;
with international clients at all levels, good planning and organizational skills, should&#13;
lead all public relations activities, incoordination with the Executive Director's office for&#13;
fundraising.&#13;
&#13;
MediaLiaison. MRRDrepresentatives with strong communication skills inDari,Pashto&#13;
and English should be identified, trained for media interviews on NSP, provide&#13;
interviews to national and foreign radio, television andprint agencies, andbe prepared to&#13;
respond to media queries.        Conversely, media agencies must know how to receive&#13;
information and conduct interviews about NSP andother MRRDprograms, activities and&#13;
issues.&#13;
&#13;
Collaborative announcements.The MRRD and other ministries should be represented&#13;
at NSP events where there i s a shared interest.         Local events must include local&#13;
representatives.    When significant milestones are reached through NSP activities,&#13;
announcements should include comments from MRRD, ANDs and its partners with a&#13;
shared responsibility or involvement. Independent national and foreign media should be&#13;
invited to these events inaddition to coverage by the PCU.&#13;
&#13;
Media analysis. MRRDrequires daily access to media monitoring o f Dari, Pashto, and&#13;
Englishradio, television and print news coverage about NSP and MRRD. Analysis o f&#13;
this coverage will assist in planning future communication activities, and in correcting&#13;
errors and inconsistencies.&#13;
&#13;
Drama production. In response to Afghans' appreciation o f drama, the PCU has&#13;
developed a popular daily series Let's Build Our Village that has aired more than 200&#13;
radio episodes on government and private radio stations.         This drama i s a valuable&#13;
representation o f how CDCs should function. The drama must be guided by set themes&#13;
and messages consistent with the ANDs, the MRRD strategic plan and the NSP&#13;
Operating Manual, to be immediately confirmed in consultation with Facilitating&#13;
Partners, andreviewed annually to keep pace with progress inthe field.&#13;
&#13;
Gender-focused communication. NSP communication products should have the&#13;
potential to reach all Afghans. PCUnews anddrama programs must be timed to air when&#13;
women will hear them. MRRDcommunication should work inconcert with the Ministry&#13;
o f Women's Affairs to find other effective mechanisms. O f note FPs do employ women&#13;
facilitators to support their work.&#13;
&#13;
Web-based communication. Web-based communication will become under NSP I1the&#13;
centerpiece for disclosure and transparency o f the program at the central level. The&#13;
website www.nspafcshanistan.org with a link to www.mrrd.gov.af will include e-mails to&#13;
facilitating partners, blogs and discussion forums. The website will be used more&#13;
strategically as a communication tool between government and the donor community at&#13;
large, nationally and internationally. The website should be an interactive tool that allows&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              126&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
seeing NSP I1achievements visually interms o f roll-out, CDC formed, and infrastructure&#13;
being built. It should also provide input/output and outcomes statistics and information&#13;
generated by NSP I1M I S department. Other information to be included in the website&#13;
includes the financial status (commitments, expenditures, and projections), sources of&#13;
finding, procurement contracts and status, implementation plan, operational manual,&#13;
technical manual, financial manual, Environmental and Social Management Framework,&#13;
contact information o f the NSP staff, FPs, donors, etc. A library section will include&#13;
technical and financial audit reports, post-reviews, impact evaluations, studies, maps and&#13;
in general any document relevant to the NSP. It will also make available the&#13;
communication material produced by the PCU such as pamphlets, newsletters,&#13;
photographs, movie clips, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Newsletter. RatherthanpublishanNSP 11newsletter, NSP should continue to contribute&#13;
to the existing bi-monthly MRRDnewsletter. Newsletter should be primarily web-based&#13;
but in a format easily printed as required for meetings, inclusion inmedia kits, and for&#13;
distribution to field operators. Additional print products specific to the NSP I1should be&#13;
produced only as required for a specific event and audiences. MRRD should review what&#13;
other government, facilitating partners and international community publications have a&#13;
linkwithNSPI1programs, andprovide information onNSP I1activities to be includedin&#13;
those publications.&#13;
&#13;
Exchange visits. Facilitating Partners in coordination with NSP staff should identify&#13;
husband and wife teams from effective gender-representative CDCs to travel to other&#13;
villages to communicate their successesandchallenges.&#13;
&#13;
Mobile theatre: establish a mobile theatre team that cantravel to CDCs andremote rural&#13;
communities. Performing live dramas and performances, followed by a discussion with&#13;
development communication experts i s an efficient tool which is very well received by&#13;
the people. Community theatre creates a "whole community" event gathering for people&#13;
o f all ages andboth genders. These activities should be coordinatedwith the FPs.&#13;
&#13;
Mobile cinema: an equally effective communication tool to reach the rural communities,&#13;
build trust and support for the program while conveying important information and&#13;
educational messages. Mobile cinemas will enable the rebroadcast o f already produced&#13;
NSP PCUTV programs, documentaries or the dissemination o f localinformation&#13;
&#13;
Communicationsupport to FPs: the development communication team o fPCUshould&#13;
strengthen its coordination with the FPs inorder to tailor specific communication tool to&#13;
their needs. This could include leaflets, posters, audio visual support. Most importantly,&#13;
PCU should help the FPs to simplify the OM so that it can become an accessible and easy&#13;
to readworking tool for the communities as they prepare their proposals.&#13;
&#13;
Anti narcotics communication: PCU should consider delivering messages through its&#13;
various communication channels aligned with the counter-narcotics strategy. PCU should&#13;
 coordinate with the Ministry o f Counter -Narcotics to identify the key messages to be&#13;
incorporated intheir communication to the rural communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             127&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12. Institutionalarrangements&#13;
&#13;
This PCU team should organize its technical and human resources in order to fulfill its&#13;
four pronged strategy: international and external communication, development&#13;
communication, advocacy and institutional strengthening. Each one o f these four&#13;
subcomponents should be led by a communication specialist for the sector. The quality&#13;
and composition o f the PCU staff should be at all times satisfactory to the World Bank.&#13;
The PCU should also extend its services to coordinate information sharingand disclosure&#13;
with the MIS department, the Complaint Handling Department, and most importantly&#13;
with the office o f the executive director to support his donor relations and fund raising&#13;
functions.&#13;
&#13;
13. Coordination&#13;
&#13;
Communication activities should not take place inisolation andmust be coordinated with&#13;
other MRRD programs, government communication priorities, and with the international&#13;
community. Communication about one government program should not seem to be in&#13;
competition with other government programs. The NSP has a well-developed production&#13;
capability that can be used to the benefit o f MRRD as a whole, as long as responsibility&#13;
and management is raised to the MRRD level, and is sufficiently and staffed and&#13;
resourced.    Public and internal communication to diverse audiences with different&#13;
languages is complex and staff should be chosen with care. FPs have developed capacity&#13;
by training their Afghan team members and could be asked to play a more proactive&#13;
development communication role.&#13;
&#13;
Trust ingovernance is only possible ifgovernment communication are and are perceived&#13;
to be honest, open and consistent. They should not increase expectations over what i s&#13;
reasonably achievable. To ensure that the public receives accurate, current information,&#13;
communicators must have up-to-date information about programs, activities and issues.&#13;
Thus the senior communication representative should have a seat and a voice at the&#13;
operations table.&#13;
&#13;
14. Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
Itis the responsibility o fthe PCUandultimately o fthe Executive Director to ensure that:&#13;
(i) communicationstrategystaysontarget,basedonresearch,and(ii)&#13;
   the                                                                    communication&#13;
efforts are two-way and horizontal, and include adequate feedback mechanisms to assess&#13;
their effectiveness over time. The degree o f success of communication will be measured&#13;
by media monitoring and analysis, phone inprograms, by formal and informal surveys,&#13;
website activity, number o f community reached by development communication&#13;
activities, overall level o f perceptions o f the communication effectiveness.  Websites,&#13;
radio programs and newsletters should invite feedback, and any meeting or conference&#13;
can be a venue to ask the participants what they know o f the communication activities&#13;
andwhat they think about their impact. The communication baseline assessment should&#13;
be replicated and other monitoring activities should be carried out in concert with other&#13;
surveys and consultations to reduce cost and maximize the sample surveyed.&#13;

         APPENDIX 13: ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; SOCIALMANAGEMENT&#13;
                                    FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ProjectObjective&#13;
&#13;
Buildingon the current IDA operation, the proposedproject will expand to new areas to&#13;
lay the foundations for a strengthening of community level governance, and to support&#13;
community-managed subprojects comprising reconstruction and development that&#13;
improve access o frural communities to social andproductive infrastructure and services.&#13;
&#13;
Reaching out to additional 4,3 16 new villages, the outcomes will be (i) the establishment&#13;
o f a framework for village level consultative decision making and representative local&#13;
leadership as a basis for interaction within and between communities on the one hand,&#13;
and with the administration and aid agencies on the other, (ii)social and economic&#13;
productive activities implemented and maintained by the communities, addressing the&#13;
basic village needs, and (iii) development of human capital and livelihood which will&#13;
                             the&#13;
improve householdwelfare.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectComponents&#13;
&#13;
The proposed IDA Grant will finance about 23 percent o f the total projected cost o f the&#13;
National Solidarity Program inthe next three years and for the following components:&#13;
&#13;
   i. Block Grants for communities (US$94.3 million) to carry out Subprojects&#13;
        involving reconstruction and development activities through a facilitated&#13;
        participatory planning process. This will cover about a third o f the amount&#13;
        estimated to complete block grant disbursement to existing and new communities&#13;
        (US$288 million) for the whole program. While the use o f block grants is&#13;
        demand-driven following the Community Development Plan priorities, based on&#13;
        the experience gained in the program to date it is expected that block grants will&#13;
        be investedmainly on community-basedproductive and social infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
  ii. Community Facilitation and Subproject Preparation (US$9.7 million) to&#13;
        support local communities through: (i) facilitation exercises to establish inclusive&#13;
        community institutions, and identify local development needs and priorities; and&#13;
        (ii)assistance for preparing subproject proposals. The FP cycle o f support to&#13;
        CDCs has been reduced from three years inthe first phase o f the program to two&#13;
        years. The two year timeframe will allow the FPs to support communities with&#13;
        mobilization and the establishing and functioning o f CDCs as inclusive&#13;
        community institutions; the formulation, through a consultative process, o f&#13;
        community development plans, identifying local needs and priorities; and&#13;
        assistance and capacity building for the implementation of priority subprojects,&#13;
        based on the community development plans utilizing the block grant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           134&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 ...&#13;
 111.   CDC Capacity Development (US$14.4 million) to assist CDCs in carrying out&#13;
        subprojects for which block grants have been made available, and capacity&#13;
        buildingfor members o f local communities. These services will strengthen local&#13;
        communities' capacity in financial management, procurement, and technical&#13;
        skills.&#13;
&#13;
 iv.    Implementation and Management Support (US$1.5 million) comprising&#13;
        provision o f consultants' services for capacity building in, implementation&#13;
        support to, and incremental operating costs for the MRRD. The project will also&#13;
        augment the MFND's human and physical capacity to supervise and implement&#13;
        the project.&#13;
&#13;
At the end o fthe three years, it is expectedthat: (i) NSP will have coveredall districts&#13;
                                                    the&#13;
across the country making available basic social and productive infrastructure and other&#13;
services resulting from receipt o f block grants, and (ii)that 21,600 CDCs (90 percent o f&#13;
an estimated total o f 24,000 villages) will be performing as representative bodies to lead&#13;
community development planning and financing intheir areas per the CDC by-laws.&#13;
&#13;
Potentialimpactsof various components&#13;
&#13;
Activities envisaged under the project should not entail significant and negative&#13;
environmental and social impacts, provided they are designed and implemented with due&#13;
consideration o f environmental and social issues. Rather, most subprojects envisaged&#13;
under the project should contribute to improving environmental and social conditions in&#13;
rural Afghanistan. Adverse impacts may arise due to depletion or degradation o f natural&#13;
resources such as stone, earth, water etc. used for construction o f small-scale&#13;
infrastructure.   Construction activities may cause limited, temporary, and localized&#13;
negative impacts that can be mitigated through the implementation o f an appropriate&#13;
social and environmental management plan. Certain types o f investments with negative&#13;
environmental or social impacts cannot be undertaken and are included in a negative list&#13;
o f prohibited investments. Interms of social impacts, the proposedproject falls inthe S-&#13;
3 category o f the Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements, and&#13;
Compensation (Attachment 3).&#13;
&#13;
No landacquisition is anticipated. Inthe current socio-political context inthe rural areas,&#13;
involuntary land acquisition i s unlikely for the kind o f small-scale activities that will be&#13;
undertaken under the proposedproject for two reasons. The first is, that local authorities&#13;
do not have access to funds to purchase landor other assets if land acquisition were to be&#13;
undertaken. The second is, that the political costs (interms o f opposition from affected&#13;
landownershsers) would in all likelihood deter the government apparatus from&#13;
attempting to acquire any land against the will o f those affected. If any minor areas o f&#13;
landwould be needed for a project (e.g. realignment o f an irrigation canal, or land for a&#13;
school), such land could only be obtained through either private voluntary donations,&#13;
compensation paid by the community (i.e. transaction between willing buyer-willing&#13;
seller), or from available government land. Private voluntary donations and community&#13;
purchases would be documented as requiredby the Framework, and for government land,&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
documentation would be needed that the land i s free o f encroachments, squatters or other&#13;
encumbrances, andhas been transferred to the project bythe authorities.&#13;
&#13;
The design for the proposed project defines a strategy, which will ensure that ethnic&#13;
minority groups are included as beneficiaries, and that their concerns are addressed in&#13;
compliance with the requirements o f OD 4.20. The key elements o f this strategy are (i)&#13;
the project i s national in scale and coverage, and consequently reaches all the country's&#13;
different ethnic groups, (ii)the facilitated participatory planning process at the&#13;
community level includes an approach for election o f Community Development&#13;
Councils, which will provide for representation o f all sub-groups inthe community, (iii)&#13;
both internal monitoring and external independent evaluation will assess the&#13;
inclusiveness o f Community Development Councils and thus provide information that&#13;
would constitute the basis for corrective actions, if necessary, and (iv) independent&#13;
monitoring by civil society (NGOs and the press) will provide another mechanism to&#13;
identify cases where ethnic minoritywould have beenbypassed or marginalized.&#13;
&#13;
Chance finds o f cultural property (archaeological artifacts) during implementation o f&#13;
subprojects involving civil works will be reported to the provincial or district governors,&#13;
who thenwill inform the Archaeological Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Compliance with the safeguard provisions and the negative list will be ensured through&#13;
an environmental, social and mine risk screening procedure (check lists) required for&#13;
subproject proposals, and by internal input, process, and output monitoring, independent&#13;
external monitoring by consultants, andby Bank supervisionmissions.&#13;
&#13;
Purpose of the Environmental and Social Management Framework&#13;
&#13;
Currently social and environmental management inAfghanistan is suffering from critical&#13;
capacity constraints. Since there i s potential for adverse environmental impacts, albeit&#13;
limited, from the proposed activities under the NSP, their mitigation and management is&#13;
key to the wholesome development o f rural communities throughout Afghanistan.&#13;
Hence, keeping in view the existing management capacity, as well as the flexibility&#13;
required due to the demand-driven nature o f the project, a framework approach is&#13;
adopted. It provides for early identification o f potential adverse impacts, without the&#13;
requirement o f rigorous analysis through quantification, and also provides broad&#13;
guidance for their effective mitigation. Consistent with existing national legislation, the&#13;
objective o fthe Framework i s to help ensure that activities under the project will:&#13;
        Protect humanhealth;&#13;
        Prevent or compensate any loss o f livelihood;&#13;
        Prevent environmental degradation as a result o f either individual subprojects or&#13;
        their cumulative effects;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and,&#13;
&#13;
    0   Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguard policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
General Principles&#13;
&#13;
Recognizing the emergency nature o f the proposed reconstruction operation, and the&#13;
related need for providing assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in&#13;
managing potential environmental and social risks, this Framework i s based on the&#13;
followingprinciples:&#13;
&#13;
    1. The proposed project will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs o f&#13;
       which is known at appraisal. To ensure the effective application o f the World&#13;
       Bank's safeguard policies, the Framework provides guidance on the approach to&#13;
       be taken during implementation for the selection and design o f subprojects, and&#13;
       the planningo fmitigation measures;&#13;
    2. All proposed subprojects will be screened (using Matrix 1) to ensure that the&#13;
        environmental and social risks can be adequately addressed through the&#13;
        applicationo f standardized guidelines (usingMatrix 2);&#13;
    3. The design o f the NSP aims at ensuring regional balance in terms o f coverage o f&#13;
        ethnic and religious groups, as well as gender equity with regard to decision&#13;
        making on subproject selection and project benefits. Employment opportunities&#13;
        within the projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the basis o f&#13;
       professional competence, irrespective ethnic or religious group affiliation. In all&#13;
        projects which require consultations with local communities or beneficiaries,&#13;
        gender-separated consultations will be conducted to elicit the views o f the female&#13;
        population, along with that o fthe male population; and,&#13;
    4. Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special&#13;
        needs o f these operations.   Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this&#13;
        Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework will be disclosed in&#13;
        Afghanistan inDari and Pashto, and inthe World Bank Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Safeguard Screening&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, the selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation o f subprojects&#13;
will be consistent withthe following guidelines:&#13;
&#13;

Mitigationmeasures&#13;
&#13;
   Sound design will ifnot eliminate, then at least diminish to the extent possible, most&#13;
   o f the potential adverse impacts o f project activities. Good Engineering design will,&#13;
   inmost cases, have a positive impact on the environmental conditions inthe project&#13;
   area.      Construction and operation stage impacts will be addressed through a&#13;
   simplified Environmental Management Plan. The EMP is provided in measures&#13;
   identified in this ESMF such as the Attachments, Matrices and other provisions o f&#13;
   this ESMF. Social and environmental guidelines and codes o fpractice satisfactory to&#13;
   the Bank will needto be included inthe Project's Operational Manual at all time.&#13;
&#13;

Responsibilitiesfor SafeguardScreeningandMitigation&#13;
&#13;
The overall responsibility o f project implementation rests with the Ministry o f&#13;
Rehabilitation andRural Development (MRRD). A designated Safeguards Nodal Officer&#13;
will be identified with responsibility for overseeing the implementation o f the&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework and Management Plan within the&#13;
Project Management Team (PMT) at the MRRD. The Ministry's Focal Point will be&#13;
supported by the Oversight Consultant firm managing the implementation o f the project,&#13;
which will be responsible for (i)  appraising subproject proposals, and (ii)&#13;
                                                                          monitoring that&#13;
subproject implementation i s in accordance with the provisions o f the social and&#13;
environmental management framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CapacityBuilding&#13;
&#13;
As part o f the social and environmental capacity building that will be provided for&#13;
implementation o f IDA-financed operations in Afghanistan, the Safeguards Focal Points&#13;
and relevant staff o f the MRRD and implementing agencies/Consultants will receive&#13;
training inthe application o f the Safeguard Framework. It is proposedto prepare specific&#13;
materials, hold a workshop, and arrange site visits to other countries in the region on&#13;
similar projects in progress to provide hands-on training to the Ministry and&#13;
implementing agency staff.      Specialist training modules may be considered after an&#13;
acceptable level o f base knowledge has been established. This capacity building activity&#13;
will be implemented under a separate Technical Assistance program for Environmental&#13;
and Social management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            139&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
During supervision o f the proposed project, IDA will assess the implementation o f the&#13;
Framework, andifrequiredwill recommend additional strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental expertise within the implementing and executing bodies will be&#13;
strengthened. Training programs will designed and implemented with the assistance o f a&#13;
local or international expert andwill target two levels:&#13;
&#13;
MRRD/NSP OC and FPs: At the initiation of the PFO, a one day workshop will be&#13;
provided to the Staff o f the MRRD/NSP OC and FPs to raise environmental awareness&#13;
and to clarify the specific Environmental requirements related to design and&#13;
implementationo fthe CDP.&#13;
&#13;
A three days workshop will then be provided to the MRRD/NSP OC environmental&#13;
specialist and to the environmental specialist/consultants o f the FPs and will cover the&#13;
following topics:&#13;
            EL4techniques&#13;
            Screening projects for environmental review&#13;

&#13;
Local NGOs and Contractors: Training would be provided through 1or 2 days workshop&#13;
for local NGOs and contractors, focusing on public awareness, case studies o f&#13;
environmental issues experienced insimilar projects, use o f environmental guidelines and&#13;
implementationo fmitigation measures.&#13;
&#13;
ConsultationandDisclosure&#13;
&#13;
This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework will be disclosed by Islamic&#13;
Republic o f Afghanistan inboth Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will also be&#13;
made available at the World Bank's Infoshop. It is worth noting that Islamic Republic o f&#13;
Afghanistan intends to make all project documentation publicly available through the&#13;
AfghanInformationManagement System (AIMS).&#13;
&#13;
Extensive consultations have been held with the Facilitating Partner NGOs regarding the&#13;
NSP approach andimplementation arrangements. Subprojects will involve consultations&#13;
within the communities regarding (i)the holding o f secret ballot elections for&#13;
representative community development Councils, (ii)      prioritization o f community needs,&#13;
(iii)identification o f projects corresponding to these needs, (iv) development and costing&#13;
o f subproject plans, and (v) arrangements to ensure disclosure o f budget and&#13;
expenditures. The following information on the project would be posted on IRA'Sweb-&#13;
site: summaries o f quarterly NSP implementation progress reports, summaries o f annual&#13;
project financial statements and audit reports, and summaries o f findings from monitoring&#13;
and supervisionteams (after a reasonable period for internalreview).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             140&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Environmental and Social Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Monitoring will be the responsibility o f the FPs and will&#13;
include: (i)Compliance monitoring during construction, and (ii)Monitoring of&#13;
significant impacts duringthe operation ofthe subproject.&#13;
&#13;
The Environmental and Social specialist of the MRRD/ NSP OC will also conduct&#13;
periodic monitoringby visiting the sites ofthe various programs at least twice a year.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoringindicators will be developed for boththe construction andthe operation phase&#13;
of the subprojects. Monitor of construction activities will have to ensure that mitigation&#13;
measures of construction impacts are being implementedproperly, while the monitoring&#13;
of operation is to ensure that no unforeseen negative impacts are arising. Typical&#13;
examples ofmonitoringplansare giveninthe table below.&#13;

&#13;
I.Objectives&#13;
&#13;
Land acquisition will be kept to a minimum and no person will be involuntarily displaced under&#13;
subprojects financed by the proposed emergency reconstruction operation. Subproject proposals&#13;
that would require demolishing houses or acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed&#13;
to minimize or avoid their impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals that require more&#13;
than minor expansion along rights of way should be reviewed carefully. No land or asset&#13;
acquisition may take place outside o f these guidelines.          A format for Land Acquisition&#13;
Assessment i s attached as Attachment 2(i).&#13;
&#13;
These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensateaffectedpersons to ensure that&#13;
all such persons negatively affected, regardless of their land tenure status, will be assisted to&#13;
improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or production capacity to&#13;
pre-project levels.&#13;
&#13;
Categorization&#13;
&#13;
Based on the number of persons that may be affected by the project (Project Affected People,&#13;
PAPs) and the magnitude of impacts, projects may be categorized as S-1, S-2, or S-3 projects:&#13;
&#13;
    a.       S-1 projects are those that will involve the resettlement o f more than 200 PAPs and&#13;
             where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. Such interventions&#13;
             will be ineligible for support under the proposed emergency reconstruction&#13;
             operations.&#13;
    b.       S-2 projects are those which will involve the rese-ttlementof less than 200 persons. In&#13;
             such cases, the following documentation i s required: (1) a land acquisition&#13;
             assessment, (2) the Minutes or recordo f consultations which assess the compensation&#13;
             claimed and agreement reached, and (3) a record of the receipt o f the compensation,&#13;
             or voluntary donation, by those affected (see below).&#13;
    C.       S-3 projects are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant&#13;
             adverse social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and&#13;
             improved livelihoods are expected from such interventions.&#13;
&#13;
11.Eligibility&#13;
&#13;
PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood i s directly or indirectly affected by the project.&#13;
PAPs deemedeligible for compensation are:&#13;
&#13;
    (1)      those who have formal legal rights to land, water resources or structureshuildings,&#13;
             includingrecognizedcustomary and traditionalrights;&#13;
    (2)      those who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufiuct right&#13;
             rootedincustomary law;&#13;
    (3)      those whose claim to land and water resources or building/structures do not fall&#13;
             within (1) and (2) above, are eligible to assistanceto restore their livelihood.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 144&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
AcquisitionofProductiveAssets and Compensation&#13;
&#13;
PAPSare eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as described below:&#13;
&#13;
       a.       Voluntary contributions. In accordance with traditional practices, individuals&#13;
              may elect to voluntarily contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or&#13;
              permanently from their land without compensation.&#13;
       b.       Contributions against compensation.         A contributor/asset loser considered&#13;
              "affected" will be eligible for compensation from the local community or&#13;
              alternatively from the Government.         A PAP will lodge his/her claim for&#13;
              compensation to the local community representatives/shura head and it will be&#13;
              verifiedby the implementingagency. The claim will be lodged within 2 weeks o f&#13;
              completion o f the consultations with the concerned community, and before project&#13;
              implementation begins. .&#13;
&#13;
Voluntary contribution, or contribution against compensation, should be documented.            The&#13;
documentation should specify that the land i s free of any squatters, encroachers or other claims.&#13;
A format is attached inAttachment 2(i), which includesa Schedule to be followed to assess any&#13;
compensation claimed and the agreementreached.&#13;
&#13;
111.CompensationPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
The project implementing agencies will ensure that any of the following means of compensation&#13;
are provided ina timely manner to affected persons:&#13;
&#13;
(1)     Project affectedpersons losing access to a portion o f their land or other productive assets&#13;
        with the remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at&#13;
        replacement cost for that portion o f land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost&#13;
        assets will be according to following principles:&#13;
        a.      replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent&#13;
                productive assets;&#13;
        b.      materials and assistanceto fully replace solid structures that will be demolished;&#13;
        C.      replacement of damagedor lost crops andtrees, at market value;&#13;
        d.      other acceptable in-kindcompensation;&#13;
        e.      incaseofcashcompensation, the delivery ofcompensationshouldbemadein&#13;
                public, i.e. at the Community Meeting.&#13;
&#13;
(2)     Project affected persons losing access to a portion o f their land or other economic assets&#13;
        rendering the remainder economically non-viable, will have the options of compensation&#13;
        for the entire asset by provision of alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset,&#13;
        accordingto the principles in(1) a-d above.&#13;
&#13;
ConsultationProcess&#13;
&#13;
The implementingagencies will ensure that all occupants of landand owners of assets located in&#13;
a proposedsubproject area are consulted. There will be gender-separate community meetings for&#13;
each affected mantaqa/gozar (urban infrastructure) or village (other projects) to inform the local&#13;
population about their rights to compensation and options available in accordance with these&#13;
Guidelines. The minutes of the community meetings will reflect the discussions held, agreements&#13;
reached, and include details of the agreement, basedon the format provided inAttachment 2(ii).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                145&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The implementing agency will provide a copy o f the Minutesto affectedpersons and confirm in&#13;
discussions with each of them their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements&#13;
reached, and any eventual complaint.          Copies will be recorded in the posted project&#13;
documentation and be available for inspectionduringsupervision.&#13;
&#13;
SubprojectApproval&#13;
&#13;
In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the implementing&#13;
agency will:&#13;
&#13;
        a. not approve the subproject unless a satisfactory compensation has been agreed&#13;
            between the affected person and the local community;&#13;
        b. not allow works to start until the compensation has been deliveredin a satisfactory&#13;
            manner to the affected persons;&#13;
        c.  ifmore than 200 persons are affectedand require compensation, the subproject will&#13;
            be deemedineligible for support under the emergency reconstructionoperations.&#13;
&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
&#13;
All complaints should first be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local community/village&#13;
level. If this falls, complaints and grievances about these Guidelines, implementation o f the&#13;
agreements recorded in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged irregularity in carrying&#13;
out the project can also be addressed by the affected persons or their representative at the&#13;
municipal or district level. If this also fails, the complaint may be submitted to the relevant&#13;
implementingagency for a decision.&#13;
&#13;
Verification&#13;
&#13;
The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements of compensation and evidence of&#13;
compensation having been made will be provided to the Municipality/district, to the supervising&#13;
engineers, who will maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic monitors when&#13;
they undertake reviews and post-project assessment. This process will be specified inall relevant&#13;
project documents, including details of the relevant authority for complaints at municipaVdistrict&#13;
or implementingagency level.&#13;

                                   Protectionof CulturalPropertv&#13;
&#13;
Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works of art, or sites o f "outstanding universal&#13;
value" from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropological point of view,&#13;
including unrecorded graveyards and burial sites.           Within this broader definition, cultural&#13;
property i s defined as sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical,&#13;
architectural, or religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed emergency reconstruction operations are unlikely to pose a risk of damaging&#13;
cultural property, as the subprojects will largely consist of small investments in community&#13;
infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstruction of existing structures, and minor&#13;
urban public works. Further, the negative list of attributes, which would make a subproject&#13;
ineligible for support (Attachment l), any activity that would significantly damage non-&#13;
                                         includes&#13;
replicable cultural property. Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification, protection&#13;
from theft, and treatment o f chance finds should be followed and included in standard bid&#13;
documents.&#13;
&#13;
ChanceFindProcedures&#13;
&#13;
Chance find procedures are defined in the law on Maintenance of Historical and Cultural&#13;
Monuments (Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities and responsibilities&#13;
of cultural heritage agencies if sites or materials are discovered in the course of project&#13;
implementation. This law establishes that all moveable and immovable historical and cultural&#13;
artifacts are state property, and further:&#13;
&#13;
     1. The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessment of historical and cultural&#13;
         monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministry o f Information&#13;
         and Culture, which has representation at provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Whenever chance finds of cultural or historical artifacts (moveable and immovable) are&#13;
         made the Archaeological Committee should be informed. Should the continuation of&#13;
         work endanger the historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended&#13;
         untila solution is found for the preservation ofthese artifacts.&#13;
&#13;
     3. If a moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found inthe countryside o f a&#13;
         province, the provincial governor (wali) or district-in-charge (woluswal) should be&#13;
         informed within two weeks, and they should inform the Archaeological Committee. In&#13;
         case the immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found ina city, the provincial branch&#13;
         of the Department of Maintenance of Historical Values of the Ministry o f Information&#13;
         and Culture shouldbe informedwithin two weeks (art. 18). Ifthe find i s made withinthe&#13;
         center, the Archaeological Committee must be informed directly within one week (art.&#13;
         25).&#13;
&#13;
     4. Failure to report a chance find within the stipulated time limit will be punished with a&#13;
         fine or imprisonment for aperiod of one week or upto one month (art. 72).&#13;
&#13;
     5. If someone intentionally damages a historical or cultural artifact, the culprit will pay&#13;
         compensation inaccordancewith the value of the artifact plus be imprisoned for a period&#13;
         o f one monthto ten years depending on the gravity o f the crime (art. 71).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 150&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In case of a chance find of moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact, the&#13;
implementing agency i s responsible for securing the artifact from theft, pilferage and damage&#13;
untilthe responsibilityhasbeentaken over bythe relevantauthorities as specified above.&#13;
&#13;
These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when&#13;
applicable. Duringproject supervision, the Site Engineer will monitor that the above regulations&#13;
relating to the treatment of any chance find encountered are observed.&#13;
&#13;
Relevant findings will be recorded in World Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs), and&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) will assess the overall effectiveness o f the project's&#13;
cultural resources mitigation, management, and capacity buildingactivities, as appropriate.&#13;

            Afghanistan - Second Emergency National
            Solidarity Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This grant for Afghanistan will support
            the national solidarity program's expansion to new
            districts to lay the foundations for strengthening community
            level governance, and support community-managed sub-projects
            comprising reconstruction and development that improve the
            access of rural communities to social and productive
            infrastructure and services. The grant will finance block
            grants to village communities, consultants for community
            facilitation and sub-project preparation, consultants for
            program management and monitoring, capacity building and
            implementation support for the implementing ministry, and
            consultants for external evaluation. The project will (i)
            empower local communities through the establishment of
            village level consultative decision making and
            representative local leadership as a basis for interaction
            within and between communities on the one hand, and with the
            administration and aid agencies on the other, and (ii)
            finance local level reconstruction, development, and
            capacity building leading to a decrease in poverty levels.
            Through these benefits, the project will also contribute to
            stability in Afghanistan. Likely risks are weak
            institutional capacity; a fragile security situation; elite
            capture of benefits, and misuse of funds. Appropriate
            mitigation measures have been proposed to address these risks.
