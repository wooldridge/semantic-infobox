    pulation--lack access to basic sanitation. There is ongoing        component with a typology of actions to help translate&#13;
    concern that governments, at many levels, are not devoting         analytical findings into more effective support to operations&#13;
    enough attention and resources to sanitation services, par-        and investments. The Diagnostic Framework aims to identify&#13;
    ticularly when compared to spending on water supply and            political economy constraints as well as opportunities that&#13;

    Bank research shows that this limited focus on sanitation          interests, and influence--and the sector process, which looks&#13;
    is driven largely by political motivation in the context of        at information flows, public debate, coalition building, and&#13;
    competing demands for resources, and to a lesser extent by         participation over time. The Action Framework illustrates&#13;

     11 In Senegal, local governments are tasked to develop local water and sanitation plans. However, a combination of capacity constraints at the local level and weak accountability&#13;
        between central and local government means that this hardly ever happens in practice. Remote rural areas are sometimes forced to take responsibility for their own sanitation&#13;
        services, as their needs are more easily ignored by the central Government in Dakar.&#13;

* Depends on district / city arrangements (only two cities have PDPAL separated from PDAM--Jakarta and Banjarmasin).&#13;
** Pit emptying.&#13;
*** Can take the role of managing septic tanks operators.&#13;
**** As with sanitation, organizational responsibility for drainage is complex and depends largely on the grade of roads and associated drains. The Ministry of Public Works is responsible&#13;
for drainage on first- and second-level roads (interprovince and intercity roads). Tertiary roads and local streets are often under local government responsibility but neighborhood streets are&#13;
often neglected. Developers build drainage systems for new housing estates and formal developments, but drainage in informally growing settlements is often unaddressed.&#13;

     In Senegal, in contrast to the Maharashtra case, political&#13;
     incentives for supporting sanitation investment were low.                     figurE 3.8 ElEcTion PoSTEr in SEnEgAl'S&#13;

     While the political leadership with broad popular support&#13;
     for President Wade's Sopi (change) coalition decided to make&#13;
     infrastructure including sanitation one of the government's&#13;
     priorities, after the 2000 elections priorities seemed to be&#13;
     shifting with the government's decreasing popularity. Politi-&#13;
     cians notably emphasized other sectors in the local elections&#13;
     of 2009 (which took place during the fieldwork for the case&#13;
     study). The challenge of improving Dakar's strained road net-&#13;
     work was clearly believed to be the number one vote winner&#13;
     by President Wade's Sopi coalition (see figure 3.9).&#13;
&#13;
     In Indonesia, in a context of low political prioritization of&#13;
     sanitation, progress has been made at the city level to create&#13;
     political incentives for support to sanitation. The ISSDP&#13;
     started a process of bringing together six cities to show and&#13;
     discuss what each had done and achieved. This process took&#13;
     on a dynamic of its own, and there is increasing friendly&#13;
     competition among the cities to perform well against each&#13;
     other. In one case, a mayor was embarrassed at the low level&#13;
     of achievement compared to the others, so he immediately&#13;
     instructed his local administration to address the issues. In&#13;
     some cities, sanitation is becoming a political electoral issue,&#13;
     with potential positive impacts on accountability-driven in-&#13;
     vestment. In Payakumbuh, for instance, the mayor is known&#13;
     as the "sanitation mayor" and sanitation investment has been                  Source: Photograph by authors.&#13;

14 Comparisons with neighbours within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in terms of sanitation coverage and the MDGs have also had a significant impact on&#13;
   interest in increasing sanitation investment. A WSP/USAID conference was organized in the Philippines in 2006­7. Attended by national government stakeholders, there was a&#13;
   perception that if the Philippines could do something, then so could Indonesia, which contributed to the start of the 2007 national summit on sanitation.&#13;

In Dakar, access to sanitation facilities was traditionally pro-&#13;
vided for those living in the areas covered (and connected)&#13;
to the sewerage network. The PAQPUD for the first time&#13;
brings onsite sanitation facilities and to a lesser extent con-&#13;
dominial systems for the poor peri-urban areas of Dakar.&#13;
The program offers technologically appropriate sanitation&#13;
solutions, and households can chose from a range of differ-&#13;
ent options in different price categories--although some of&#13;
these solutions are not categorized as "improved" sanitation&#13;
under the MDGs. The subsidies are a one-off investment&#13;
subsidy and are not intended to cover either consumption&#13;
or maintenance costs. Moreover, there is awareness within&#13;
local communities that there is a clear difference between&#13;
the willingness and the ability to pay for sanitation provi-&#13;
sion. As one community leader in a semi-urban community&#13;
in Dakar summarized: "Some of our neighbors don't have&#13;
enough money for regular meals. How should they afford&#13;
the expense of a latrine?" Some communities have responded&#13;
to this problem by setting up a fund at community level (for&#13;
example, the fund in Diamaguene led by UN HABITAT) to&#13;
cover the contribution for those who cannot afford to pay&#13;
for sanitation and encourage support from micro-finance&#13;
institutions (for example, in Ngor).&#13;

     support for institutional change. The state government and&#13;
     district administrations in Maharashtra have sought to ensure&#13;
     that the sanitation program is well known across the state,&#13;
     and to this end have made extensive use of local mass media,&#13;
     with awards reported widely and given a high profile. This&#13;
     has been critical to the program's success and is reflected in&#13;
     the program budget allocation for communication.&#13;
&#13;
     Investment in communication is crucial to generating "effec-&#13;
     tive demand" (linked to advocacy) for sanitation within low-&#13;
     income communities. Such engagement can enhance both&#13;
     program quality during implementation and sustainability&#13;
     by securing broader buy-in to program aims. In Senegal,&#13;
     using popular topics (water supply, drainage) can provide the&#13;
     platform for discussions around improving sanitation provi-&#13;
     sion with local communities, consumers, and champions of&#13;
     change within the communities. (For example, wastewater&#13;
     and drainage are a problem for many Senegalese communities&#13;
     during the rainy season) In Brazil, the World Bank achieved&#13;
     a strong partnership with the incumbent right-wing political&#13;
     grouping in Bahia. However, the Bank could have made more&#13;
     effort to demonstrate to the government's critics on the left&#13;
     that it was using its leverage with this grouping to push it&#13;
     toward greater openness to public debate and engagement&#13;
     with civil society. This would in turn have strengthened the&#13;
     Bank's credibility with future administrations from the left&#13;
     wing.&#13;
&#13;
     Although the media in Indonesia are generally no more aware&#13;
     of sanitation issues than the general public and coverage is&#13;
     limited, there is potential to develop partnerships that enable&#13;
     sanitation messages to be conveyed effectively. The Indone-&#13;
     sian Sanitation Sector Development Program (ISSDP) has&#13;
     recognized this potential in the design of its second phase,&#13;
     which will have components on advocacy, campaigning,&#13;
     communications, and promotion.&#13;

   Hygiene is the set of human behaviors related to safe management of excreta, for example, washing hands with soap or safe disposal of children's feces.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     26 For instance, Water Aid (2003) highlights that sanitation is devalued by most governments and donors; sanitation solutions are generally not known or poorly understood;&#13;
        communities are rarely involved in policy, programming and innovation; sanitation impact on health and development is not clearly understood; institutional roles and&#13;
        responsibilities remain confused at the country level; coordination within the sector and between sectors related to sanitation (water supply, public works, health, agriculture,&#13;
        education, etc.) remains weak and undermines sanitation development.&#13;
     27 Globally, sanitation projects have moved from supply- to demand-led approaches.&#13;
     28 OED report on Development Effectiveness (2005: vii) states that effectiveness can be improved by tailoring operations to the circumstances of each country and adapting strategies&#13;
        to the local political economy.&#13;

            The political economy of sanitation : how
            can we increase investment and improve service for the poor?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study follows current approaches to
            political economy-interdisciplinary inquiry drawing upon
            social and political theory and economic principles-to
            understand how political actors, institutions, and economic
            processes influence each other. The 'political economy
            of sanitation,' therefore, refers to the social,
            political, and economic processes and factors that determine
            the extent and nature of sanitation investment and service
            provision. This study's conceptual framework combines a
            diagnostic component with a typology of actions to help
            translate analytical findings into more effective support to
            operations and investments. The diagnostic framework aims to
            identify political economy constraints as well as
            opportunities that are entry points for subsequent
            operational actions. The study was conducted through a
            qualitative analysis of stakeholders, institutions, impacts,
            risks, and opportunities that was linked to processes and
            policy debate. This synthesis report is based on the
            findings from the secondary literature review and the
            results of primary research in the four case study
            countries, which examined how each had identified and
            managed political economy risks and opportunities in its
            sanitation interventions. Overall, the study confirms the
            importance of assessing stakeholder interests, identifying
            potential winners and losers, identifying incentives, and
            examining formal and informal institutions.
