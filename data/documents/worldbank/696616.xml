SOCIAL SECTORS STRATEGY AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
TO THE&#13;
MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT&#13;
I. COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
1.   Indonesia has just completed its first 25-year development plan in which its&#13;
accomplishments included steadily rising income -- per capita GNP reached an estimated&#13;
US$884 in 1994; a decline in poverty incidence from 60 percent (70 million persons) at&#13;
the beginning of the 1970s to 15 percent (27 million persons) in 1995; and considerable&#13;
success in making social services accessible. Universal primary education has been&#13;
achieved, secondary and tertiary enrollments have risen sharply and the adult illiteracy&#13;
rate has fallen by almost two thirds. Infant mortality rate (IMR) declined from 142 deaths&#13;
per 1,000 livebirths in 1968 to 57 deaths per 1,000 livebirths in 1994.&#13;
2.    Looking ahead to the next 25-year development plan, Indonesia is setting its&#13;
sights on more ambitious and appropriate objectives: continuing to sustain high rates of&#13;
income growth, progressing in poverty reduction efforts while also addressing&#13;
inequalities and improving quality of life and social services. For all of the above, the&#13;
government realizes the importance of the social sectors and has embraced human&#13;
resource development as a key instrument and objective in the current five-year&#13;
development plan (REPELITA VI) and in utilizing donor funds.&#13;
3.    Yet despite the emphasis on human resource development and some recent&#13;
improvements in relevant indicators, major challenges to improve the effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency of the social sectors remain. These challenges are evident in the slow pace of&#13;
IMR decline in the late 1980s, low utilization rates of health facilities, the continuing&#13;
high drop out rate in primary education, and the slow increase in secondary education&#13;
enrollment. Indonesia has only now reached a stage of health development which&#13;
countries like Malaysia and Thailand transcended 15-30 years ago. Addressing these&#13;
challenges involves the adaptation to an increasing regional orientation while improving&#13;
the coverage, efficiency and quality of social sector services, especially health and&#13;
education. To this end, there is a need to ensure that government as well as private&#13;
spending responds to the need for additional resources for these sectors, that government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
outlays be used to address market failures and to efficiently provide services that will&#13;
benefit the poor, and that enabling environments conducive to private service provisions&#13;
are established.&#13;
4.    The Government's (GOI) ability to achieve its human resources objectives is&#13;
impeded by the lack of an overall framework and operational strategy to translate&#13;
REPELITA VI goals into action. Because of this, the planned investments for the sector&#13;
represent only a small percentage of the REPELITA VI allocation --planned investments&#13;
represent about one fifth and one quarter of the REPELITA VI allocations for health and&#13;
education, respectively.&#13;
5.    Several factors have contributed to the lack of a broad vision and tactical program&#13;
for the social sectors. First, capacity remains limited within the National Development&#13;
Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and the planning units in the line ministries to carry out&#13;
sector analysis, medium-term planning and priority setting and to develop operational&#13;
approaches. This is due in part to the still limited experience of planning staff in&#13;
identifying the key issues facing the social sectors and analyzing existing data to assess&#13;
needs and priorities. In addition, those few staff with training and experience in policy&#13;
and strategy development are utilized mainly for other functions like preparing projects&#13;
and coordinating donor activities. Second, there is no clear process for translating&#13;
REPELITA goals and objectives into an investment plan that is based on a careful&#13;
analysis of alternatives and priorities. Existing approaches enable the identification of&#13;
very broad sector goals but do not translate these into clear options and investments that&#13;
could be implemented later. In addition, and partly as a consequence of the above two&#13;
points, there are a number of analytic efforts that are urgently needed for the sectors to&#13;
move ahead (see Annex 1 for more details).&#13;
6.    Strategies for human resource development also need to address emerging issues,&#13;
especially decentralization, and to define clear processes for dealing with them. Till now,&#13;
decentralization has been pursued slowly through discrete and incremental steps.&#13;
However, the next phase requires a more clearly defined roadmap and framework.&#13;
BAPPENAS, the line ministries and the provinces are in the process of changing their&#13;
roles, functions, and relationships with one another. This in turn will necessitate an&#13;
assessment of alternatives and capacity to carry out the new roles, and an identification of&#13;
the skills needed and the type of capacity building effort that should be planned.&#13;
7.    GOI recognizes that overcoming the above constraints will have significant&#13;
development impacts. A number of initiatives to address these have been undertaken.&#13;
For example, integrated planning and budgeting for the health sector has been introduced&#13;
at the provincial level, a pilot for decentralized decision making at the district level is&#13;
underway in 26 districts, and a number of provincial investments that build provincial&#13;
capacity in selected areas have been approved in the last 5 years. However, the various&#13;
measures have not coalesced into revised strategies for the social sectors and the pace of&#13;
improvements in human resource indicators remains relatively slow. In response,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
Indonesia is about to embark on an exercise to develop its sector strategies and build the&#13;
needed capacities to arrive at the desired outcomes in human resource development.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Institutional Setting&#13;
8.    The project will provide support at the central level to: BAPPENAS (Deputy IV -&#13;
Human Resource Development); and to planning bureaus and planning officers in the line&#13;
ministries (Health, Education and Culture, Social Affairs and Religious Affairs). I At the&#13;
provincial level, support will be provided to institutions reporting to the Provincial&#13;
Governor (Bappedas and Dinases) and to the line ministries (Kanwils). A description of&#13;
the institutional settings of the main agencies involved in the project is presented below.&#13;
Central Level&#13;
9.    BAPPENAS is a non-department institution that assumes a key role in&#13;
development in Indonesia. It was established in 1963 and is responsible for incorporating&#13;
national development goals into medium-term development plans (REPELITA);&#13;
allocation of resources within the economy and preparation of the National development&#13;
budget; coordination with donors, mobilization of foreign resources and allocation of&#13;
local and foreign-sourced funds to finance the development budget; and monitoring of&#13;
major project implementation among others.&#13;
10.   BAPPENAS is chaired by the State Minister for Development Planning with a&#13;
vice-chairman and eight Deputies for groups of economic activities (Fiscal and monetary&#13;
Regulation, Economic Development, Infrastructure Development, Human Resource&#13;
Development, Regional Development, Fund Allocation and Implementation&#13;
Management, Foreign Cooperation, and Administrative Affairs). Four or five Bureau&#13;
Chiefs in charge of sub-sectors report to each Deputy Chairman. An organizational chart&#13;
for BAPPENAS is present in Chart 1. The project will largely support the Deputy for&#13;
Human Resource Development and his four Bureaus, especially those principally&#13;
concerned with the health and education sectors.&#13;
11.   Line Ministries. Within the line ministries, at the central level, planning activities&#13;
are carried out by the Bureaus/units of Planning as well as by planning officers located in&#13;
the different Directorates. The Bureau of Planning is under the Secretary General's&#13;
Office and is headed by a Bureau Chief, supported by several divisions (about 5 to 7).&#13;
The Bureau of Planning is responsible for coordinating planning of all sector programs&#13;
under both the routine and development budgets as well as for monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of sector programs. The Bureau also provides guidance to the Directorates on the&#13;
methodology and techniques for planning and assists the Directorates in preparing&#13;
projects.&#13;
1Ministries of Finance and Home Affairs will also have limited participation in project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
Provincial Level&#13;
12.   At the provincial level, the provincial development planning agencies (Bappedas)&#13;
are the main government agency for overall planning and coordination. They are under&#13;
the administration of the provincial Governor. Each Bappeda is headed by a chairman&#13;
assisted by a secretariat and five divisions responsible for: research; economic affairs;&#13;
social and cultural affairs; physical facilities; and statistics and reports. Bappedas play an&#13;
important in role provincial planning including: formulation of the provincial five-year&#13;
development plan (Repelitada); preparation of annual implementation schedules for the&#13;
provincial programs; and coordination of development planning at provincial levels. The&#13;
Bappedas also prepares the development budget for the province/district and monitor the&#13;
progress of program implementation.&#13;
13.   Sectoral planning activities are carried out by the Kanwils, who are responsible to&#13;
the line ministries, and by the dinases responsible to the Local Government. The Kanwil&#13;
is typically staffed by a chief assisted by a secretariat and several divisions, including one&#13;
which is responsible for planning activities. Staff are funded from the budget of the line&#13;
ministry. The Dinas is responsible for contributing to the provincial sectoral plan and&#13;
their implementation. The distinction between the roles of the Kanwil and Dinas is not&#13;
clearly defined.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
14.   Project Objectives. The project would provide, over four years, support for&#13;
conducting sector studies, formulating strategies and building institutional capacity for&#13;
the social sectors, especially health and education. More specifically, the project aims to&#13;
(a)    develop sector strategies for social sectors, especially health and&#13;
education;&#13;
(b)    build capacity in BAPPENAS and planning bureaus/units of line&#13;
ministries to develop concepts and strategies, plan, monitor and evaluate&#13;
sector performance and programs; and&#13;
(c)    build capacity of provincial staff -- Bappedas, provincial line ministries&#13;
(Kanwil), and Dinas-- to design, prepare, implement, monitor and evaluate&#13;
programs.&#13;
15.   In addition, the project will support provincial efforts to determine sector&#13;
priorities and prepare investment plans, and support project design and feasibility studies&#13;
as well as pilot projects.&#13;
16.   Project Components. The proposed project will provide support to BAPPENAS,&#13;
line ministries (especially health and education) and the provinces. A description of&#13;
project activities for the different implementing agencies is given below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
17.    Support to BAPPENAS This component will assist BAPPENAS to&#13;
(a)    formulate sector strategies and investment priorities including plans for&#13;
further decentralization of the social sectors and design of enabling&#13;
environments to encourage private sector development through the&#13;
provision of TA and support for key sector studies2;&#13;
(b)    review the planning frameworks for social sectors and identify ways to&#13;
strengthen the linkage between REPELITA goals, strategy formulation,&#13;
and program identification, design, and implementation;&#13;
(c)    improve skills needed and processes used to review and appraise&#13;
investment plans, set priorities, monitor and evaluate sector performance;&#13;
(d)    build in-house capacity needed to achieve the above activities, after careful&#13;
assessment of capacity building efforts. On-the-job training is likely to be&#13;
an important element of this effort;&#13;
(e)    develop and institutionalize training programs for planning and&#13;
management of social sectors, especially at the provincial effort3; and&#13;
(f)    provide technical inputs for the mid-term review of REPELITA VI and the&#13;
formulation of REPELITA VII.&#13;
18.    Activities to be supported by this component will include: sector analysis and&#13;
studies, development of decentralization strategies, review of planning frameworks,&#13;
assessment of staff skills and training needs, on-the-job training of staff; development of&#13;
training programs for social sectors planning and pre-feasibility studies. This component&#13;
will also support a limited number of advisors, who could be either in-house or provide&#13;
technical advice on demand to BAPPENAS.&#13;
19.    Support to Line Ministries This component will assist the planning units in the&#13;
selected line ministries (Health, Education and Culture, Religious Affairs, Social Affairs)&#13;
to define and operationalize their sector strategies (covering public-private delivery and&#13;
targeting public interventions) and to carry out selected sector studies. The component&#13;
will also include provisions to review and improve monitoring and evaluation systems&#13;
and capacities. Support for selective training programs to strengthen the capacity of these&#13;
units and for carrying out a small number of pilot studies (e.g. operations research) and&#13;
feasibility studies will also be included.&#13;
2In addition, BAPPENAS staff have identified needed TA for assistance with strategy development for&#13;
selected social issues like (1) gender and development; and (2) social welfare, especially the disabled&#13;
individuals and the isolated communities.&#13;
The proposed program is likely to be carried out by local universities (e.g., Ul and/or other institutes with&#13;
similar capacities). The program design will also be linked to the capacity needs assessment planned&#13;
for the first year of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
20.   In addition, the Ministry of Home Affairs will participate in project&#13;
implementation as a facilitator for provincial Bappedas, and Ministry of Finance staff&#13;
who deal with social sector issues will participate in selected training activities.&#13;
21.   Support to Provinces. The main objective of the provincial component is to assist&#13;
the provinces in carrying out their emerging role in planning and designing and&#13;
eventually financing programs. To this end the project will, after careful needs&#13;
assessment and evaluation of current efforts, develop and implement training programs&#13;
for the provinces to improve skills in project design, implementation, management and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. The training programs will be developed after careful needs&#13;
assessment of the provincial staff needs and existing skills. The programs will include&#13;
basic training modules that will be implemented in all provinces and more specialized&#13;
modules that will be provided to provinces on demand. Further, the capacity building&#13;
efforts need to be coordinated with the work that will be carried out at BAPPENAS and&#13;
the Bureaus of Planning to develop guidelines to assist the provinces in their new roles.&#13;
A significant part of the capacity building effort will be for the Bappedas and provincial&#13;
staff (both Dinas and Kanwil) involved in the planning and delivery of social sector&#13;
services.&#13;
22.   The support for provinces will be carried out at two levels: (a) an intensified&#13;
support for training, sector analysis, and preparation of investment plan in about five&#13;
provinces selected according to agreed criteria; and (b) general support for an additional&#13;
number of provinces (three to five) that consists of basic training as well as provision of&#13;
resources for pre-feasibility study proposals that could later be developed into project&#13;
design and feasibility studies.&#13;
23.   Performance Indicators. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve social&#13;
sector indicators. However, these indicators should not be used to monitor and evaluate&#13;
project implementation and impact since there are a number of intervening variables, e.g.,&#13;
the macro finance trends for the sectors, investments in other sectors, implementation of&#13;
other projects, that will affect and bias these measures. Accordingly, proximate&#13;
indicators for monitoring the implementation and outputs of the project have been&#13;
suggested and are summarized in Annex 2.&#13;
24.   These indicators have been identified for each project objective. The main criteria&#13;
for their selection was that they are relatively simple, easy to measure (and interpret), and&#13;
reflect implementation progress and/or project outputs. Special attention has been given&#13;
to measuring the implementation and effectiveness of training efforts aimed at&#13;
transferring skills and building capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
25.   The main indicators identified for monitoring project outputs are (Annex 2-Table&#13;
1):&#13;
&gt; number of completed sector studies of acceptable quality (including preparation of&#13;
REPELITA VII chapters for social sectors);&#13;
=&gt; number of central and provincial investment plans (e.g., included in the "blue book");&#13;
=&gt; competency level of target staff (as defined by the capacity building needs&#13;
assessment);&#13;
=&gt; proportion/number of social sector proposals submitted to BAPPENAS of acceptable&#13;
quality; and&#13;
&gt; availability of key indicators for social sectors at the national and provincial levels.&#13;
26.   In addition, project implementation will be monitored using the following inputs&#13;
and process indicators (Annex 2-Table 2):&#13;
=&gt; number of studies initiated/completed (3 months of expected date);&#13;
=:&gt; number of consultants hired (within 1-3 months of expected date);&#13;
=  number of investment plans (e.g., project design, feasibility studies)&#13;
initiated/completed at the central and provincial levels;&#13;
7&gt; number of staff trained;&#13;
=  initiation/completion of the review of planning process(es);&#13;
=&gt; initiation/completion of training program development;&#13;
=. identification of key sectors indicators; development of data systems for increasing&#13;
access to these indicators;&#13;
27.   In addition to these indicators, the project management team will develop a more&#13;
extensive set of indicators to monitor project activities and ensure adequate&#13;
implementation. The project management unit (PMU) will furnish to the Bank quarterly&#13;
reports monitoring and evaluating progress achieved in project implementation, in&#13;
accordance with the identified indicators, starting no later than December 31, 1996.&#13;
28.   Selection of Project Activities. Terms of reference for key activities that will&#13;
start during the first year of project implementation were discussed and agreed during&#13;
negotiations. A list of those activities is presented in Annex 3. Other activities may be&#13;
selected during project implementation.&#13;
29.   Review Process. Guidelines about informing potential beneficiaries, review, and&#13;
approval of Sub-projects (e.g., sector studies, design and pre-feasibility studies) at the&#13;
provincial and central level have been prepared and will be included in the project&#13;
implementation manual. Criteria and procedures for reviewing and approving Sub-&#13;
projects were agreed to at negotiations and will be further detailed in the project&#13;
implementation manual. Moreover, the PMU will furnish to the Bank for approval Sub-&#13;
projects proposals and training programs to be carried out during the next fiscal year, by&#13;
no later than September 30 of each year starting no later than September 30, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
II1. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
30.   Project Management. The project will be executed at provincial and district&#13;
planning offices and at central planning bureaus of the ministries of health and of&#13;
education and culture and will be coordinated overall at BAPPENAS. The project&#13;
management structure (see Chart 2) is briefly described below.&#13;
a Steering Committee (SC) that is chaired by the vice chairman of BAPPENAS&#13;
and that includes members from Echelon I representatives from the various line&#13;
ministries involved in the project (Health, Education and Culture, Religion, Home&#13;
Affairs, Social Affairs, and Finance) and Deputy IV of BAPPENAS. The main&#13;
role of the SC is to provide policy guidance on implementation of the project.&#13;
The SC should meet at least twice a year;&#13;
*     a Project Director who will be the Deputy Chairman for Human Resources&#13;
Development (Deputy IV) BAPPENAS. The Director will be responsible for the&#13;
overall guidance of the project implementation and will liaise with the SC on&#13;
policy related matters related to the project;&#13;
*     Technical Committee(s) (TC) that are chaired by the Project Manager (see&#13;
below) and comprise Bureau chiefs under Deputy IV, BAPPENAS; chiefs of&#13;
Bureaus of Planning of line ministries; chairmen of provincial Bappedas; and&#13;
technical experts (as needed). The TC will assist the Project Manager on&#13;
substantive matters related to the project and screening of the various TAs&#13;
proposed by the executing agencies (EAs). The TC should have a flexible&#13;
structure depending on the needs of the project and should meet at least four times&#13;
a year and upon the request of the Project Manager. One meeting to be held&#13;
before annual World Bank review;&#13;
*     a Project Manager who is a qualified experienced staff appointed full-time to the&#13;
project. The Project Manager is responsible for overall project implementation&#13;
and is assisted by a Project Management Unit and a Treasurer. The Project&#13;
Manager will also act as secretary to the SC;&#13;
*     a Project Management Unit (PMU): Management support directly to the Project&#13;
Manager. Membership consists of a Technical Support Team (TST) comprising&#13;
expatriate and national technical experts in selected sectors and administrative&#13;
support unit. Counterparts for the TST members will be at three levels: 1)at&#13;
BAPPENAS - division heads from designated bureaus in BAPPENAS; 2) at the&#13;
line ministries - designated staff form Bureaus of Planning; and 3) at the&#13;
provinces - the Bappeda. The counterparts should assign adequate time for&#13;
working on the project;&#13;
*     Provincial Project Secretariats (PPSs): Chaired by chief division of&#13;
social/cultural affairs of Bappedas and comprising Kanwil and Dinas staff of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
selected sectors in selected project provinces (i.e., those where major social sector&#13;
investment plans will be prepared- estimated number is about five). The main&#13;
role of the PPS is to facilitate provincial level studies and capacity building&#13;
efforts.&#13;
31.   The main objective of the PMU is to promote the effective planning and&#13;
management of the TA and training activities so that TA objectives are met in a cost&#13;
effective and timely manner. The PMU will assist the different executing agencies (EAs)&#13;
in the planning, procurement, monitoring, evaluation, and follow-up action of TA and&#13;
training services. In support of this, the PMU develop a Project Implementation Manual&#13;
(PIM) by April 30, 1997 which standardizes all activities related to the preparation of&#13;
project documentation packages (PDPs) and terms of reference (TORs), the evaluation of&#13;
proposals, the negotiations of fees with selected consultants, the contracting procedures&#13;
and monitoring of TA services. The PIM should be consistent with the Bank Guidelines&#13;
for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency (August 1981). The PMU will also be responsible for collecting and&#13;
analyzing data on performance indicators and will furnish to the Bank for review and&#13;
comment quarterly reports monitoring and evaluating progress achieved in project&#13;
implementation starting no later than December 31, 1996. In addition, by July 30, 1998,&#13;
the PMU will carry out a mid-term review of the project based on a progress report&#13;
furnished to the Bank by April 30, 1998. TORs and staffing of the PMU were agreed to&#13;
during negotiations. Procedural aspects for the establishment of the PMU is a condition&#13;
of disbursement for consultant services for BAPPENAS and the line ministries.&#13;
32.   Bank Supervision. In view of the range of activities and the need for flexibility,&#13;
individual projects will be reviewed through periodic consultations between GOI and the&#13;
Bank. In view of the nature of technical assistance expected to be financed under this&#13;
project, considerable inputs are likely to be required from headquarters (HQ) staff and&#13;
consultants, especially for reviewing TORs and study proposals. A team of experts will&#13;
be identified (both inside and outside the Bank) who will assist in reviewing and&#13;
commenting on TORs and study design. Although this is likely to increase the cost of&#13;
supervision, it is essential for the first 18 months of project implementation. In addition,&#13;
a major review of project implementation and progress towards objectives will be&#13;
conducted two years after implementation starts (mid-term review). A tentative schedule&#13;
for supervision mission has been outlined in Annex 4.&#13;
33.   Project Costs and Financing. The overall project cost is estimated at US$ 25.0&#13;
million equivalent including local taxes amounting to US$ 1.4 million equivalent and&#13;
US$ 1.2 million equivalent of contingencies. Detailed costs for the different project&#13;
components are estimated as follows:&#13;

34.   The Bank Loan of US$ 20 million equivalent will finance 100 percent of the&#13;
studies and consultant services at the provincial level and 80 percent of those at the&#13;
central level4; 40 percent of the local training, 100% of overseas training costs, and 100%&#13;
of project management costs. Equipment will be financed at 100% by GOI. GOI's&#13;
contribution will be used mostly for local expenditures. In addition, a significant part of&#13;
GOI's share in project costs will be in kind in the form of counterpart staff and in&#13;
facilities and services provided to manage and implement the project.&#13;
Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
35.   Procurement of consultants. All consultant services will be procured in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. In particular, fee levels and&#13;
overhead expenses will be negotiated to reflect the nature and length of the assignment&#13;
and the level of expertise required. Also, budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters&#13;
See Annex 5 for a breakdown of consultant services by type.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
of invitations, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts would be subject to Bank's&#13;
prior review for all contracts estimated at US$ 100,000 equivalent per contract or more&#13;
with consulting firms and US$ 50,000 equivalent or more with individual consultants.&#13;
The Standard Form of Contract for Consultant's Services will be used.&#13;
36.   Contracts that are estimated below US$100,000 equivalent with consulting firms&#13;
or US$50,000 equivalent with individual consultants would be subject to random post-&#13;
review. However, these exemptions to Bank prior review shall not apply to: (a) terms of&#13;
reference for such assignments; (b) single source selection of consulting firms; (c)&#13;
assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank, (d) amendments&#13;
to contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to US$&#13;
100,000 equivalent or above, or (e) amendments to contracts for employment of&#13;
individual consultants raising the contract value to US$ 50,000 equivalent or above.&#13;
37.   As for training activities financed by the project, those will be reviewed by the&#13;
Bank on annual basis. Administrative costs for travel, per diem, allowances, supplies,&#13;
maintenance and office accommodations for project administration will be based on&#13;
GOI's administrative procedures.&#13;
38.   Disbursement. Disbursement percentages for each category of TA and for&#13;
training are given in Schedule B of the Memorandum of the President (MOP). A Special&#13;
Account (SA) will be set up in Bank Indonesia or a commercial bank with initial&#13;
authorized allocation of US$2.00 million for all expenditures.&#13;
39.   Disbursement procedures include:&#13;
(a)   one copy of the final contract and two copies of the English Contract&#13;
Summary would be submitted prior to the first disbursement application&#13;
for TA contracts subject to prior review by the Bank;&#13;
(b)   the evaluation report, one copy of the final signed contract and two copies&#13;
of the English Contract Summary would be submitted together with the&#13;
first application for withdrawal for TA contracts subject to post review by&#13;
the Bank; and&#13;
(c)   Statement of Expenditures (SOE) procedures would apply to expenditures&#13;
for: (i) training and administrative expenditures; and (ii) contracts for&#13;
employment of consulting firms valued at less than $ 100,000 equivalent&#13;
each and contracts for the employment of individual consultants valued at&#13;
less than $ 50,000 equivalent each. Contracts would be retained by the&#13;
PMU and made available for review by visiting Bank missions.&#13;
40.   Reporting. The PMU would prepare and submit quarterly reports starting no later&#13;
than December 31, 1996. In general, the report should provide data on project inputs and&#13;
implementation indicators (see Annex 2 for more details).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
41.   Audit of Accounts. The PMU would maintain separate project accounts in a form&#13;
satisfactory to annual audits. These accounts, including the Special Account, would be&#13;
audited annually by an independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and would include&#13;
opinions on all expenditures, including those made against SOEs. The PMU would&#13;
submit the audited accounts to the Bank for review no later than six months after the&#13;
closing of each fiscal year.&#13;
42.   Technical Audits. During negotiations, agreement was reached that technical&#13;
audits of selected major assignments would be carried out by independent experts in a&#13;
manner satisfactory to the Bank, to review performance of consultants and of training&#13;
programs and their institutional development impact.&#13;
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
43.   Benefits. The project will assist GOI in formulating clear sector strategies for&#13;
improving the performance of the social sectors. This is essential if Indonesia wants to&#13;
reach a stage of human resource development attained by some of its neighboring&#13;
countries like Malaysia and Thailand and increase its competitiveness. Building capacity&#13;
for development planning within BAPPENAS, the line ministries and the provinces will&#13;
improve overall sector performance. The special attention given to building capacity and&#13;
encouraging innovation at the provincial level will be key for improving the quality of&#13;
social sector programs and for ensuring their sustainability as decentralization proceeds.&#13;
Further, the emphasis on monitoring and evaluation needs is key for improving the&#13;
effectiveness and efficiency of the social sectors. The project will also strengthen&#13;
BAPPENAS's focus on strategic issues, assist the transition to decentralization, and&#13;
encourage innovation at the provincial level. Finally, the proposed activities will assist in&#13;
developing investment plans for the sectors that will generate more resources for these&#13;
sectors from both GOI and donor sources.&#13;
44.   Risks. The main risk is that the different activities supported by the project will&#13;
not coalesce to produce the desired impact on social sector strategies. Strong ownership&#13;
by the GOI team, expected effective management of project implementation as well as a&#13;
commitment to adequate supervision by the Bank will minimize this risk. Risks&#13;
pertaining to slow appointment of consultants would be minimized by the role the PMU&#13;
would play in providing assistance to various implementing agencies. The risk that too&#13;
many studies may be managed at the central level has been foreseen and resources for&#13;
provincial level studies have been specifically allocated. The risk of poor ownership has&#13;
been minimized by a demand driven process for proposal selection and identification of&#13;
TA.&#13;
45.   Sustainability. Sector strategies and project design and feasibility studies to be&#13;
supported by the project will enhance the quality at entry of projects and therefore&#13;
enhance the overall sustainability of the sectors. In addition, the project has a number of&#13;
features that will enhance its sustainability. These include: (a) institutionalization of&#13;
training program(s) needed for building capacity to ensure that these programs can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
continue after the project closes; (b) reviewing and initiating planning processes that will&#13;
continue beyond the period of the project; (c) developing approaches and models for&#13;
carrying out social sector plans at the provincial level, models which would be replicated&#13;
in other projects and provinces; and (d) developing monitoring systems and indicators for&#13;
sector performance at the central and provincial levels. These systems will be maintained&#13;
after the project and will have a significant impact on the overall performance of the&#13;
sectors.&#13;
V. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND POVERTY IMPACT&#13;
46.   The proposed project does not have any environmental impact and has been&#13;
classified in environmental Category C. The project strengthens poverty alleviation&#13;
efforts by addressing some of the strategic issues and possible solutions to improve&#13;
targeting of human resource services to the poor.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
SOCIAL SECTORS STRATEGY AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
HEALTH AND EDUCATION SECTORS:&#13;
BACKGROUND AND KEY ISSUES&#13;
I. HEALTH SECTOR&#13;
1.    Despite significant improvements in health status and the provisions of health&#13;
services in Indonesia during the past 25 years, much remains to be done to respond to the&#13;
changing disease patterns and improved socioeconomic circumstances of Indonesians.&#13;
The unfinished agenda includes increasing the total resources available to health,&#13;
improving the effectiveness of the delivery system and decentralization of health services.&#13;
However, the ability of the government to address these issues is limited by the&#13;
institutional capacity for translating goals into sector strategy, policy analysis, priority&#13;
setting and development of operational plans. The proposed project aims to provide&#13;
resources to build the required institutional capacity at the central and provincial levels&#13;
and to carry out crucial policy analysis and sector studies.&#13;
2.    Twenty-five years ago the health status of the Indonesian people was&#13;
characterized by:&#13;
* high infant and child mortality due largely to infectious diseases;&#13;
* superimposed on, and contributing to, high rates of protein-energy and&#13;
micronutrient malnutrition;&#13;
* relatively low rates of non-communicable diseases in adults; and&#13;
* inefficient health services which were not widely accessible to the population.&#13;
3.    Since 1970, overall health status has improved significantly:&#13;
* despite a possible plateau in the 1980s, IMR has fallen from approximately 90 per&#13;
1000 livebirths in 1970-74 to 57 in 1994 and CMR from 166 to approximately 80;&#13;
* acceptance of family planning has risen dramatically and the population growth&#13;
rate has shown a corresponding decrease; and&#13;
* the prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition has decreased significantly.&#13;
4.    Over the same period, while there have been significant increases in total public&#13;
spending on health, it has basically kept pace with inflation and the increase in&#13;
population:&#13;
* in the 1970s public spending on health was 0.2% of GDP and is currently 0.7% of&#13;
GDP and 4% of total government expenditures;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-                        ANNEX I&#13;
*  nevertheless, real per capita public spending in 1991/92 was only 6% higher than&#13;
in 1982/83;&#13;
*  in the 1 990s total expenditure on health was approximately $12 per capita (2% of&#13;
GDP) of which one-third came from public expenditure and two-thirds from&#13;
private sources:&#13;
* consequently, per capita government expenditure on health in India and China&#13;
exceeded that in Indonesia, while outlays in Thailand and Malaysia are large&#13;
multiples of the Indonesian figure.&#13;
5.    Despite these chronically low levels of public spending, there has been an&#13;
increase in the number and improved distribution of public health facilities, as a result of&#13;
which there has been a very significant increase in accessibility to modem health&#13;
services.&#13;
6.    Nevertheless, despite these overall gains there are significant differences in health&#13;
status and the utilization of health services between socioeconomic groups and regions of&#13;
the country:&#13;
* there are differences in IMR and CMR between provinces (in Java/Bali the IMR&#13;
in West Java at 72 per 1000 livebirths is significantly above that of Jakarta and&#13;
Yogyakarta at 24 per 100 livebirths and there are similar differences between&#13;
provinces in other regions);&#13;
*  the IMR of groups of lower socioeconomic status are still significantly higher and&#13;
have fallen at a slower rate than those of higher socioeconomic status (over the&#13;
period 1970-74 to 1990-94 the IMR of children born to mothers with primary&#13;
education fell from 95 to 55 per 1000 livebirths while the rate for those born to&#13;
mothers with no education decreased from 115 to 85);&#13;
*  maternal mortality remains high in many parts of the country; and&#13;
*  utilization of health services by the poor increased to reach 54% by 1987 but then&#13;
fell to 44% in 1992.&#13;
7.    At the same time the epidemiologic transition has proceeded with an increase in&#13;
the importance of chronic non-communicable diseases of adults and a decrease in the&#13;
burden due to infectious disease in children.&#13;
8.    Nevertheless, the health system in Indonesia has significant problems&#13;
* despite the increases which have occurred, total expenditure ($12 per capita) is&#13;
low compared to other countries in the region (e.g., in Asia (excluding India and&#13;
China) total expenditure at $61 per capita represents 4.5% of GDP;&#13;
=&gt; as with total expenditure, both public and private spending on health&#13;
services are much lower than in other countries in the region,&#13;
=&gt; it is estimated that provision of the limited package of public health and&#13;
clinical interventions recommended for low income countries in the World&#13;
Development Report (WDR, 1993) on health would cost $10 per capita -&#13;
thus adoption of this basic package would require a considerable increase&#13;
in public spending as well as reallocation within the current outlays,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-                          ANNEX I&#13;
* in addition, public spending is biased against the poor and in favor of the non-&#13;
poor;&#13;
=: utilization of public health services by the poor (as compared to the&#13;
nonpoor) is low and decreasing - this is particularly true for hospitals and&#13;
less so for health centers,&#13;
=&gt; consequently, the public subsidy is more available to the nonpoor,&#13;
&gt; further, recent trends have increased the proportion of public funding&#13;
allocated to hospitals (from 42% of government health expenditure in&#13;
1984 to nearly 50% in 1991) and decreased the proportion allocated to&#13;
health centers (from 40% of total government health spending in 1984 to&#13;
35% in 1991), deepening the bias in public spending against the poor,&#13;
z&gt; in addition, the pipeline of public investment in the health sector involves&#13;
even further emphasis on hospitals and will lead to even further bias&#13;
against the poor.&#13;
* overall, the health system is not responding to meet the challenges contained in&#13;
the new situation,&#13;
=&gt; overall, the response is still in terms of centrally-directed blank-et&#13;
approaches which ignore local variation in disease patterns and service&#13;
needs,&#13;
= the response to changing disease patterns (for example the fall in infant&#13;
mortality and rise in non-commullicable diseases of adult in the more&#13;
developed areas of the country) has been slow and inadequate,&#13;
= the staffing patterns and skills are inappropriate,&#13;
=&gt; the administration of the public healtlh services (including personnel and&#13;
budget procedures) continues to be centrally driven and frequently&#13;
unresponsive to the provincial and local situation.&#13;
z and the bias against the poor continues and deepenis.&#13;
9.     While the h.ealth systcmi as a wNhole has not responided to these challenges, some&#13;
Hiitiltives have been talkeni:&#13;
*  government has promoted limited healttl Iisurance.&#13;
*  increased cost recoverv h1as beeni introduced in soIm1e health f'acilities,&#13;
*  integrated budgtets at the provincial level have beeni introdduced for several&#13;
provinces.&#13;
*  there have beeni incremental moves to decceilralizationi in some provinices,&#13;
*  other projects have responded to specif'ic disc.:se challenges.&#13;
10.   These initiatives notwithstanding, the overdfl  esponse of the system has been&#13;
slow and inadequate.&#13;
11.   An important aspect of'the limited abilitv of the tovernmenit to respond to the&#13;
current health situation is the institutionial setting, and particularly the capacity of the&#13;
government to analyze the situation, design and implement projects and monitor change.&#13;
At the government level this involves -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-                       ANNEX 1&#13;
* the Five-Year Development Plan or REPELITA, an indicative plan which&#13;
translates and elaborates the main objectives and priorities of development&#13;
contained in the GBHN,&#13;
+ the annual National Budget which is the instrument for detailed development to&#13;
meet the goals and targets of the REPELITA,&#13;
* BAPPENAS, the key central government institution in development in Indonesia,&#13;
whose mandate covers coordination, implementation and monitoring of all&#13;
development planning,&#13;
* the central Ministry of Health where the Planing Bureau has responsibility for&#13;
policy analysis and strategic planning within the sector,&#13;
* at the provincial level&#13;
&gt; the Bappeda, whose main function is to provide coordination of all&#13;
provincial development planning, monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&gt; the Dinas Kesehatan, responsible for delivery of health services.&#13;
12.   Each of these areas of governnent is limited in its ability to respond to the current&#13;
challenge.&#13;
i while laudable goals for the sector are set through the REPELITA there is no&#13;
coherent strategy and framework which identifies realistic instruments for&#13;
reaching the goals through changes in the sector,&#13;
* at BAPPENAS there is a limited ability for policy analysis or for conceptualizing&#13;
projects and most staff are tied up with routine matters. As a result, planned&#13;
investments for health represent only one-quarter of the REPELITA allocation&#13;
and do not necessarily reflect government priorities,&#13;
* in general, the Ministry of Health remains committed to increasing the extent of&#13;
the public system without due attention to improved quality or increased private&#13;
funding of health expenditure,&#13;
* at the Bureau of Planing, where preparation of health project currently occurs is&#13;
limited by staff availability and skills. There is no capacity for analysis of issues,&#13;
medium term planning and priority setting and development of operational plans&#13;
in the sector or for articulation of an overall sector vision and forging a&#13;
commitment to it,&#13;
* provincial capacity is even more limited and there is no clear plan for preparing&#13;
the Bappeda or the Dinas Kesehatan through building their capacity for policy&#13;
analysis and implementation, a critical issue as decentralization proceeds and&#13;
provinces need to play a larger role in developing their own programs,&#13;
* while there is a general goal of decentralization there is no clearly defined&#13;
framework and timetable through which it will be implemented.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-                         ANNEX I&#13;
13.   Thus the critical policy issues are&#13;
* how to increase the ability of the sector to carry out policy analysis, and plan and&#13;
implement change through building capacity at the central and provincial levels.&#13;
The most important questions to be addressed in policy analysis and planning for&#13;
change are -&#13;
+ how to increase the total resources available to the health sector (from both public&#13;
and private sources) with emphasis on -&#13;
=&gt; delivery of basic packages of health services, with emphasis on the poor,&#13;
&gt; increased private contribution by the middle and upper income groups,&#13;
with particular attention to cost recovery and health insurance,&#13;
z harnessing and stimulating service providers in the private sector;&#13;
* how to improve the effectiveness of the delivery system through&#13;
&gt; reallocation of public expenditure away from hospitals to health centers&#13;
and sub-centers,&#13;
&gt; promotion of locally appropriate responses to the prevailing health&#13;
services and health situation,&#13;
&gt; improved quality of health services at all levels,&#13;
7&gt; improved productivity,&#13;
=&gt; improved staffing of health services, including the provision of more&#13;
appropriate training;&#13;
+ how to decentralize the health services including attention to&#13;
, promotion of health service structures and interventions which are&#13;
appropriate to the local situation,&#13;
7&gt; an overall plan, transition strategy and timetable for decentralization,&#13;
=  clarification of the roles of the center, provinces and districts in a&#13;
decentralized system,&#13;
z&gt; reform of planing, personnel and budgetary procedures including&#13;
provision for transfer of funds through block grants and transfer of control&#13;
over staff,&#13;
=&gt; assistance to the provinces and districts to strengthen their ability to&#13;
manage services.&#13;
II. EDUCATION SECTOR&#13;
14.   This annex reviews changes in education status and provision of education&#13;
services in Indonesia in the last 20 years and concludes that while there have been&#13;
dramatic improvements, Indonesia is now at another cross-roads in the development of its&#13;
human capital. The challenges it faces are substantial and include enhancing quality of&#13;
primary education and reaching the very poor who are still outside the system, providing&#13;
nine-years of basic education to the 50% cohort not currently enrolled, and bringing about&#13;
a paradigm shift in higher education. The ability of the government to address these&#13;
issues is limited by the institutional capacity for translating goals into sector strategy,&#13;
policy analysis, priority setting and development of operational plans. The proposed&#13;
project aims to provide resources to build the required institutional capacity at the central&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-                       ANNEX 1&#13;
and provincial levels and to carry out crucial policy analysis and sector studies.&#13;
15.  Indonesia has made significant achievements in education in the past two decades:&#13;
* While 60% of adults were illiterate in 1970, by 1993, illiteracy was reduced to&#13;
15%;&#13;
* At the basic education level, gross enrollment rates increased rapidly between&#13;
1973-1993 from 60% (13 million students) to 97% (30 million students) in&#13;
primary, and 17% (1.5 million) to 54 % (7.1 million) in junior secondary;&#13;
+ Enrollments at senior secondary and tertiary are comparable to countries with&#13;
twice Indonesia's per capita income: 35% (4.2 million) at senior secondary and&#13;
11% (2 million) in tertiary.&#13;
16.   The above gains have been achieved by maintaining a sound expenditure policy:&#13;
* Public expenditure on education over the past two decades averaged 3% and 14%&#13;
of GDP and total government expenditures, respectively;&#13;
* The share of primary education was maintained at 45% of the total education&#13;
budget, with secondary and tertiary receiving 25% and 13%, respectively. Again,&#13;
this reflects the pattern adopted by Indonesia's successful East Asian neighbors;&#13;
* The combination of high public sector shares in provision of primary schooling&#13;
and variations in age composition across income groups have resulted in a pro-&#13;
poor bias of public spending on primary education.&#13;
17.   Another strong point of the Indonesian education system is the relatively high&#13;
level of private participation in education, particularly beyond the primary level.&#13;
* More than 50% and 70% of enrollment at the secondary and tertiary levels,&#13;
respectively are provided by private schools and universities;&#13;
* Households spend about 1.5% of GDP on education, demonstrating a significant&#13;
private contribution to human capital development.&#13;
18.   Notwithstanding the progress achieved to date, the education sector faces some&#13;
formidable challenges in the medium to long term.&#13;
* Increasing retention and access of the rural poor, particularly in the Outer&#13;
Islands to quality primary education.&#13;
=&gt; Still only 84% of primary school-aged children from the poorest 20% of&#13;
households enroll in primary school and most of these not attending are&#13;
concentrated in the Outer Islands;&#13;
= Overall retention rates in primary schools are approximately 75% with the&#13;
Outer Islands averaging 60% and some of the poorest provinces as low as&#13;
40%;&#13;
=&gt; Tests of cognitive ability show that student learning abilities are weak. On&#13;
average, less than 50% of the curriculum is absorbed by students, and&#13;
Indonesian students performed low in international comparisons of&#13;
reading achievement tests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-                         ANNEX I&#13;
* Expanding quality basic education (three years beyond primary) to the 50% oJfthe&#13;
age-group who are currently not enrolled and who are primarily the rural&#13;
population and some urban poor.&#13;
z There are significant differences in enrollment among income groups and&#13;
urban-rural residents: net enrollment rates among the lowest quintile is&#13;
25% compared to 66% for the top quintile; and 33% for rural children&#13;
compared to 62% for urban;&#13;
=&gt; High costs, both direct (official and unofficial fees, uniforms, books, etc.)&#13;
and indirect (high travel time, foregone earnings) of junior secondary&#13;
education constitute a deterrent for poor households;&#13;
=&gt; Achieving the nine-year basic education policy objective will require&#13;
significant outlays of public resources to school construction, upgrading of&#13;
teachers, textbooks and learning materials, scholarships to poor children.&#13;
and subsidies to private schools for quality improvements. This implies a&#13;
significant level of recurrent costs to sustain the system once the program&#13;
is fully implemented (in approximately 15 years). Effective delivery of&#13;
basic education will require more focused analyses of education needs and&#13;
imply the identification of issues at lower (provincial, district) levels,&#13;
addressing those issues through flexible, locally specific strategies.&#13;
z&gt; An important issue in achievement of the nine-year policy is what role the&#13;
private sector can continue to play and how. It currently enrolls 40%,&#13;
serves an important equity consideration (a higher proportion of the poor&#13;
attend private schools), but is of relatively lower quality than public&#13;
schools. The level of savings of public resources is very high if the&#13;
expansion is done with the private sector, not underestimating&#13;
administrative difficulties.&#13;
-  Rationalization of the v ocational ind technicail senior secontlary stream.&#13;
= The VTE stream currently enrolls about 30% of senior secondary students.&#13;
The current system is costly andi the labor market outcomes it provides for&#13;
its graduates are indistinguishable from those in the general stream.&#13;
&gt; The government's plan to increase the VTE enrollment share to close to&#13;
50% should be carefully analyzed in light of the above and other sectoral&#13;
priorities.&#13;
*  Development of i coherent frameuwork./or a large and diferentiated higher&#13;
education system.&#13;
= With enrollment rates at high levels (11%) for a country of Indonesia's per&#13;
capita inicoimie, and in light of the government's priority to achieve&#13;
universal ninie-years of education in the next 15 years, there is need to shift&#13;
from quantity expansion to quality improvements throughout the higher&#13;
education system, and to continue the high levels of reliance on private&#13;
financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
=&gt; GOI is beginning a paradigm shift in this sector from a highly centralized&#13;
system to one that grants financial and academic autonomy to public&#13;
institutions while simultaneously establishing a clear framework of&#13;
accountability for their performance. The main elements of the "New&#13;
Paradigm" for the public sector include: (i) greater decentralization of&#13;
management; (ii) provision of higher education in less-developed regions&#13;
and in high-priority fields; (iii) increased emphasis on economic&#13;
considerations in determining public fund investments; and (iv) significant&#13;
role in enhancing quality in both public and private institutions.&#13;
=&gt; For the more than 1,300 private institutions, there is need for quality&#13;
enhancement through the establishment of a workable accreditation&#13;
mechanism.&#13;
19.  In order to meet the challenges it is facing in primary and junior secondary&#13;
education, Indonesia would probably need to allocate a higher proportion of GDP to&#13;
education. This would also bring it closer to the regional average of 4%. But increasing&#13;
resources is only one side of the story and by itself will not automatically produce more&#13;
and better educational services. Accompanying resource increases there is need for&#13;
continuous analysis, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of programs at&#13;
all levels of government.&#13;
20.   An important aspect of the ability of the government to carry out these aspects is&#13;
the institutional setting. This involves:&#13;
* The Five-Year Development Plan or REPELITA, an indicative plan which&#13;
translates and elaborates the main objectives and priorities of development&#13;
contained in the GBHN,&#13;
* The annual National Budget which is the instrument for detailed development to&#13;
meet the goals and targets of the REPELITA,&#13;
* BAPPENAS, the key central government institution in development in Indonesia,&#13;
whose mandate covers coordination, implementation and monitoring of all&#13;
development planning,&#13;
* The central Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) where the Planning&#13;
Bureau has responsibility strategic planning within the sector and Balitbang has&#13;
responsibility for policy analysis; and the central Ministry of Religious Affairs&#13;
(MORA) which is becoming a larger player in providing education services;&#13;
* At the provincial level: The Kanwil MOEC whose functions are (i) to provide&#13;
coordination of education strategy, planning, monitoring and evaluation including&#13;
coordination with MOHA and MORA; and (ii) delivery of education services; and&#13;
the Dinas MOHA, who is responsible for delivery of primary education.&#13;
21.   Each of these areas of government is limited in its ability to respond to the current&#13;
challenge:&#13;
* While laudable goals for the sector are set through the REPELITA there is need&#13;
for a more coherent strategy and framework which identifies realistic instruments&#13;
for reaching the goals through changes in the sector;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23 -                       ANNEX I&#13;
* At BAPPENAS there is a limited tire of experience in policy analysis or for&#13;
conceptualizing projects and most staff are tied up with routine matters. As a&#13;
result, planned investments for education represent only one-quarter of the&#13;
REPELITA allocation and do not necessarily reflect government priorities;&#13;
+ At the Bureau of Planing and the line departments within MOEC and MORA&#13;
(where preparation of education projects currently occurs) there is limited&#13;
capacity for analysis of issues, medium term planning and priority setting and&#13;
development of operational plans in the sector or for articulation of an overall&#13;
sector vision and forging a commitment to it;&#13;
* Provincial capacity is even more limited and, while there are plans being&#13;
developed under the current Secondary Education Projects for preparing the&#13;
Kanwils, it is one of the first of such initiatives and will require careful&#13;
monitoring to draw lessons for future projects;&#13;
+ While there is a general goal of decentralization there is no clearly defined&#13;
framework and timetable through which it will be implemented. This requires:&#13;
n promotion of education service structures and interventions which are&#13;
appropriate to the local situation;&#13;
=&gt; an overall plan, transition strategy and timetable for decentralization;&#13;
= clarification of the roles of the center, provinces and districts in a&#13;
decentralized system;&#13;
=&gt; reform of planning, personnel and budgetary procedures including&#13;
alternatives for transfer of funds and transfer of control over staff;&#13;
=&gt; assistance to the provinces and districts to strengthen their ability to&#13;

            Indonesia - Social Sectors Strategy and
            Capacity Building Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Social Sectors Strategy and Capacity
            Building Project will provide, over four years, support for
            conducting sector studies, formulating strategies and
            building institutional capacity for the social sectors,
            especially health and education. More specifically, the
            project aims to: 1) develop sector strategies for social
            sectors, especially health and education; 2) build capacity
            in the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and
            planning bureaus/units of line ministries to develop
            concepts and strategies, plan, monitor and evaluate sector
            performance and programs; and 3) build capacity of
            provincial staff - Bappedas (Provincial Development Planning
            Agency), provincial line ministries (Kanwil), and the local
            government technical office (Dinas) - to design, prepare,
            implement, monitor and evaluate programs. In addition, the
            project will support provincial efforts to determine sector
            priorities and prepare investment plans, and support project
            design and feasibility studies as well as pilot projects.
            The project will provide support to BAPPENAS, line
            ministries (especially health and education) and the
            provinces. Support the BAPPENAS will include the following
            activities: 1) sector analysis and studies; 2) development
            of decentralization strategies; 3) review of planning
            frameworks; 4) assessment of staff skills and training
            needs; 5) on-the-job-training of staff; and 6) development
            of training programs for social sectors planning and
            pre-feasibility studies. Support to line ministries will
            assist the planning units in the selected line ministries
            (health, education and culture, religious affairs and social
            affairs) to define and operationalize their sector
            strategies (covering public-private delivery and targeting
            public interventions) and to carry out selected sector
            studies. This component will also include the following: 1)
            provisions to review and improve monitoring and evaluation
            systems and capacities; 2) support for selective training
            programs to strengthen the capacity of these units and for
            carrying out a small number of pilot studies and feasibility
            studies. Finally, the support for provinces will consist of:
            1) an intensified support for training, sector analysis, and
            preparation of investment plan in about five provinces
            selected according to agreed criteria; and 2) general
            support for an additional number of provinces that consists
            of basic training as well as provision of resources for
            pre-feasibility proposals that could later be developed into
            project design and feasibility studies.
