Role relative to ministers&#13;
Based on these considerations, there is general&#13;
One of the most sensitive relationships for a    consensus that ministers should retain respon-&#13;

isters. It is sometimes suggested that the min-   investment, privatization, sector restructuring,&#13;

significant discretion clearly have a policy role.   There is less consensus on where responsibil-&#13;

            Utility regulators : roles and responsibilities
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            There are three main issues in defining
            a utility regulator's role: the scope of its coverage,
            its role in relation to ministers, and its role in relation
            to other regulatory entities such as the competition agency
            or agencies dealing with environment or health and safety.
            The author makes a case for multi-industry agencies covering
            everything from power to water to transport. Multi-industry
            agencies have several advantages that are especially
            important for developing countries. They allow the pooling
            of scarce expertise. They reduce the risk of industry and
            political capture. They reduce the risk of inconsistency in
            regulatory approaches across sectors. And they help to deal
            with the blurring of industry boundaries as utilities enter
            one another's markets (as when power utilities enter
            telecommunications, and water and power utilities merge).
