stone houses built and occupied by the rural poor -- and rendered  Reconstruction Program&#13;
another 265,000 houses at least temporarily uninhabitable. Housing  Owner-driven&#13;
reconstruction and human settlement accounted for US$3.27 billion or  Harmonized approach&#13;
almost half of the reconstruction needs.                         Flexible to local realities&#13;
Multiple tranches of&#13;
The Rural Housing Reconstruction Program will focus on restoring  grant assistance with&#13;
affected housing in 14 targeted rural districts while providing  verification&#13;
technical support to enhance the government's ability to improve long-  Designed around&#13;
term disaster resilience.                                        rebuilding with greater&#13;
resilience&#13;
The program's overall objective will ensure that houses destroyed in the  Based upon international&#13;
experiences and best&#13;
most-affected districts of the country will be rebuilt using earthquake-  practices from other&#13;
safer building techniques through grants and technical assistance to  Housing Reconstruction&#13;
eligible households from the Government of Nepal.                Programs&#13;
The program also seeks to equip beneficiaries with skills to construct earthquake-safer core housing&#13;
units supported by training, technical support and a subsidy program, and allow people to continue&#13;
incremental construction with improved techniques.&#13;
To support the Government of Nepal's rural housing reconstruction efforts, a Multi-Donor Trust Fund has&#13;
been established with supportfromn the US Agencyfor International Development (USAID), the Swiss Agency&#13;
for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the World Bank. Key Development Partners, such as the Japan&#13;
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), are working in close collaboration with MDTF partners in extending&#13;
the coverage of the rural housing reconstruction program services to additional areas of the country.&#13;
121&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿BENEFICIARIES&#13;
The program will directly benefit approximately&#13;
55,000 households (or about one-tenth of the&#13;
housing destroyed in the earthquake sequence)&#13;
located in municipalities within the 14 most-affected&#13;
districts of Nepal (see figure 1). A high proportion&#13;
of houses in these districts are categorized as&#13;
completely damaged and/or in need of demolition.&#13;
Technical advice (provided through the RHRP),&#13;
to improve long-term disaster resilience, will be&#13;
aimed at all housing reconstruction beneficiaries&#13;
estimated to be approximately 490,000 households.&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿ELIGIBILITY&#13;
Eligibility will be determined based on a comprehensive, door-to-door assessment of the damages to the&#13;
housing stock in the affected districts, carried out by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).&#13;
Key Steps in the Eligibility Process:&#13;
*  Eligible beneficiaries under this program must sign a legally binding Participation Agreement (PA)&#13;
with their respective Village District Committee (VDC) or municipality. The Participation Agreement&#13;
outlines the entitlements and obligations of both parties regarding key details of the program such&#13;
as payment, housing construction standards, and grievance redress mechanisms.&#13;
* Those who have started reconstruction with their own initiatives are eligible to receive a subsidy&#13;
provided that inspections certify that they are following the Nepalese Building Code (NBC)&#13;
standards as well as environmental and social standards.&#13;
*  Beneficiaries will receive technical and social support to rebuild their houses using earthquake-&#13;
safer construction standards, in line with the NBC, and a subsidy of NPR 200,000 (Nepalese Rupee)&#13;
per house.&#13;
* The subsidy will be disbursed in three tranches, conditional on meeting the program standards as&#13;
follows: NPR 50,000 upon signing the Participation Agreement, NPR 100,000 upon completion up&#13;
to lintel/wall level, and NPR 50,000 upon casting of the roof.&#13;

IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES&#13;
The Nepal Rural Housing Reconstruction Program is structured around five major stages of&#13;
implementation (see Figure 1) -- each one building upon the other, as follows:&#13;
Stage 1: The Survey&#13;
Figure 1 - Building Resilience in Nepal:&#13;
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)              Stages of Implementation&#13;
is conducting a comprehensive census of&#13;
damage to the housing stock in each of the&#13;
fourteen most-affected districts. Technical and&#13;
logistical support is being provided by UNDP&#13;
(United Nations Development Programme).&#13;
This door-to-door assessment will generate&#13;
a beneficiary/damage database to serve as&#13;
the basis of the rural housing reconstruction              Stage IV:&#13;
program as well as assist in the effective               Reconstruction&#13;
monitoring of the recovery process.&#13;
Stage IIl.&#13;
CBS will liaise with the Ministry of Housing              Enrollment&#13;
Affairs  (MoHA)/District  Disaster  Relief&#13;
Committees (DDRC) in the data collection                   Stage II:&#13;
and use the data already collected by the rapid      Identification &amp;Validation&#13;
visual assessment that has been conducted&#13;
by the MoHA/Ministry of Federal Affairs and                 Sgey&#13;
Figue1caBuiThn SRey  inNep&#13;
Local Deelopment(MoFALD)&#13;
StgeII&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Stage II: Identification and Validation&#13;
Based on the eligibility criteria, an analysis of the survey results will generate a list of eligible households&#13;
at the Village Development Committee level (and when possible, at the local ward level). The beneficiary&#13;
list will be published at the local level and a grievance period of 35 days will be provided to allow for&#13;
inclusion/exclusion claims and grievances.&#13;
Stage III: Enrollment&#13;
Eligible beneficiaries will enroll in the program by entering into a legally binding Participation Agreement&#13;
(PA) with their VDC or municipality. The PA outlines the entitlements and obligations of both parties&#13;
regarding key details of the program such as:&#13;
*  payment&#13;
*  housing construction standards and&#13;
*  grievance redress mechanisms (how beneficiaries can address any complaints).&#13;
During enrollment, those beneficiaries without bank accounts will be assisted with opening one or with&#13;
determining another workable payment mechanism.&#13;
Stage IV: Reconstruction&#13;
The principal of owner-driven reconstruction is fundamental to the Nepal housing program.&#13;
Beneficiaries will be supported with socio-technical assistance; training and market facilitation; and cash-&#13;
based assistance, provided in tranches, upon certification of earthquake-safer techniques guided by&#13;
Nepal's National Building Code (NBC). The reconstruction stage encompasses the following components&#13;
(see Figure 2):&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Training: A cascading training program is an integral part of the reconstruction effort. A uniform&#13;
reconstruction training curriculum has been developed and approved by the Ministry of Urban Development&#13;
(MoUD). At the national level, "master trainers" are being prepared to instruct and coach mobile teams&#13;
on resilient construction techniques/materials. The mobile teams will, in turn, work in individual VDCs/&#13;
municipalities to train artisans and contractors who will be directly involved in the reconstruction. Training&#13;
centers and technical assistance support will be set up in collaboration with partner organizations (e.g.,&#13;
NGOs, private sector firms, academia, etc.), which will be responsible for the training of master artisan&#13;
trainers, mobile trainers, artisans and homeowners.&#13;
Subsidies: In conjunction with training, a subsidy for housing reconstruction will be provided in tranches,&#13;
based on proper completion of various stages of construction. This will encourage owner-driven&#13;
reconstruction alignment with Nepal's National Building Code (NBC). The VDC/municipality will assure&#13;
the layout and building as per the LSGA (Local Self Government Act); DUDBC (working in conjunction with&#13;
DTO/DoLIDAR and other Partner Organizations (POs)) will ensure the adaptation of the National Building&#13;
Code. Housing grants will be directly deposited into individual beneficiary bank accounts which will follow&#13;
a relaxed Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirement as specified by NRB (Nepal Rastra Bank, the Central&#13;
Bank of Nepal). The accounts will include the following minimum service features:&#13;
* a savings account with transaction facility,&#13;
*  relaxed KYC attributes, including Earthquake-Affected Household IDs in cases where a beneficiary&#13;
does not possess a citizenship document, and&#13;
* accessible at a bank branch, an ATM or an agent.&#13;
Logistics Hub, Labor and Building Material Markets Facilitation: The program will help guarantee a&#13;
continuous supply of building materials and skilled labor, and manage potential shortage and/or adverse&#13;
price fluctuations of the resources through Partner Organizations. To this end, the program will:&#13;
* develop area-specific demand and supply projections, and provide this information to the private&#13;
sector and consumers,&#13;
* establish resource availability and price-tracking mechanisms,&#13;
* provide continuous information on prices, location, and mechanisms for procurement to beneficiaries,&#13;
POs, and the private sector, and&#13;
* develop action plans to ensure appropriate and continuous supply of materials and skilled labor&#13;
implementation Support: Each VDC will have a mobile team composed of technicians and social&#13;
mobilizers. The team's main responsibility will be to conduct awareness campaigns and orientations&#13;
for homeowners, provide on-the-job assistance to workers on site, and organize social gatherings and&#13;
meetings to discuss problems and difficulties faced during the reconstruction phase in order to help&#13;
identify solutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿It  Inspection and Certification: Inspection will be conducted to ensure that the housing reconstruction&#13;
follows the NBC and is in compliance with the necessary conditions for the cash transfer. Inspection will be&#13;
done per stage:&#13;
1. upon signing of the Participation Agreement,&#13;
2. upon completion of the foundation up to the lintel/wall, and&#13;
3. upon completion of the roof.&#13;
Stage V: Completion&#13;
In the final stage of the program cycle, the beneficiary will obtain the "Building Construction Completion&#13;
Certificate", which precedes the occupancy of the housing unit. At the completion stage, it will be vital for&#13;
the RHRP to broadly launch a clear communications message to inform beneficiaries on how to request&#13;
and obtain the Building Construction Completion Certificate.&#13;
GRIEVANCE REDRESS MECHANISM (GRM)&#13;
The housing reconstruction program offers beneficiaries the opportunity to pursue complaints with the&#13;
program. This grievance mechanism system includes:&#13;
* a recording and reporting system, with the ability to file grievances both verbally and in writing,&#13;
* designated staff with responsibility at various levels of governments, and&#13;
* a specific protocol for handling grievances including the minimum time frame within which different&#13;
types of grievances should be addressed.&#13;
Beneficiaries or non-beneficiaries may file grievances at one of following reporting locations depending&#13;
upon convenience for the filer and on the nature of the complaint: (i) the VDC/municipality office, or (ii)&#13;
the PO offices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&amp;E)&#13;
An effective reporting, monitoring and evaluation system will be in place to gather, standardize and&#13;
measure all data streams related to reconstruction, earthquake-safer compliance and technical support&#13;
activities. The information will be used for analysis, planning and course corrections. Clear mechanisms will&#13;
be set in place to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of various activities in order to rapidly improve&#13;
strategies or any aspect of program implementation (for example, improving training programs over time).&#13;
The M&amp;E system will be built upon the information collected during the Earthquake Household Damages&#13;
and Characteristics (EHDC) survey as well as data generated during the program cycle.&#13;
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (MIS)&#13;
The Nepal Rural Housing Reconstruction Program (RHRP) will use the Department of Civil Registration&#13;
(DoCR1/MoFALD) MIS design framework to automate the business process of RHRP. This means that the&#13;
MIS for RHRP will use the same architecture and interface design framework of the existing MoFALD MIS&#13;
in terms of database design structure, data flows, user interface look-and-feel, and its navigation. However,&#13;
the sub-system for RHRP will be managed by DoLIDAR.&#13;
The approach will develop a'sub-system' for RHRP in compliance with the overall MoFALD MIS platform&#13;
that will help ensure data standardization, maintain uniformity and establish the potential data sharing&#13;
mechanism between the RHRP sub-system and DoCR/MoFALD MIS as per the business requirements&#13;
of the program.&#13;
COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY&#13;
A communications strategy and plan are being&#13;
prepared for approval by the Program Steering&#13;
Committee. The communications strategy will&#13;
be consistent with the following fundamental&#13;
tenets of the program:&#13;
* consistency and clarity,&#13;
* beneficiary-centered,&#13;
*  culturally/socially sensitive,&#13;
*  timely,&#13;
*  responsible,&#13;
* planned, and&#13;
* continuously adjusted, based on feedback.&#13;
