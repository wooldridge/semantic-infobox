1. THE SECTOR&#13;
A. MACROECONOMIC SETTING&#13;
1.1   In 1991, Argentina initiated a reform program which streamlined the public sector,&#13;
transformed the monetary system and contracted the foreign debt, and thus restored confidence in&#13;
the market as the primary force behind economic growth and monetary stability. As a result,&#13;
Argentina dramatically reduced inflation (from an annual rate of 4,923 in 1989 to about 3.8% in&#13;
1994) and sustained an average annual real economic growth rate of 5.5% during 1991-94.&#13;
1.2   The Argentine fiscal reform program balanced the federal budget by simplifying the tax&#13;
structure, improving tax collection efficiency and rationalizing expenditures. In addition, many&#13;
State enterprises were privatized and numerous State-run services eliminated. As one of the main&#13;
pillars of this program, a fixed exchange rate regime (Convertibility Plan) was established in 1991,&#13;
under which the monetary base has to be fully backed by international reserves. The process also&#13;
restructured economic relations between the national and provincial governments supported by&#13;
two Federal Agreements (Pacto Federal and Pacto Fiscal), signed in 1992 and 1993 respectively,&#13;
through which provinces pledged to reduce the size of their public sector and balance their fiscal&#13;
situation. At the same time, the federal government pledged its assistance to this process by&#13;
implementing a broad incentive program and establishing an automatic system for sharing with the&#13;
provinces the tax revenues collected at the federal level (Ley de Coparticipaci6n).&#13;
1.3   Increasing confidence in the economic reforms resulted in the levels of foreign capital&#13;
flows expanding from negative US$1.1 billion in 1990 to positive US$3.6 billion in 1994. The&#13;
growing economy led to imports growing from US$4 billion in 1990 to over US$21.5 billion in&#13;
1994. Until 1994, capital goods imports led the expansion, indicative of the acceleration in&#13;
investments and the restructuring of the economy. Exports also expanded, from US$12.4 billion&#13;
in 1990 to more than US$15.8 billion in 1994. Improved economic conditions in Brazil&#13;
contributed to the export growth, and the advent of the MERCOSUR pointed towards even&#13;
greater economic interdependence with Brazil, which today accounts for 28% of Argentina's total&#13;
trade.&#13;
1.4  In 1995, following the fast expansion of the first four years of the Convertibility Plan, as a&#13;
consequence of the repercussions of the Mexican financial crisis, the Argentine economy suffered&#13;
a recession, during which GDP declined approximately 4.4% and unemployment reached 16.6%,&#13;
even though inflation decreased to 1.6%. During the first half of 1995, capital outflows caused a&#13;
30% decline in liquid reserves. However, reflecting stronger international commodity prices, a&#13;
real depreciation of the local currency (Peso) and the fast pace of the economic expansion in&#13;
Brazil, exports expanded to US$21 billion in 1995. Because of a sharp contraction in import&#13;
demand (1995 imports declined to US$20 billion in 1995), the trade balance improved, shifting&#13;
from a US$5.8 billion deficit in 1994 to about a US$1.0 billion surplus in 1995. As a result, the&#13;
current account deficit was cut to US$2.8 billion, less than half the 1994 level, or 1.0% of GDP.&#13;
Despite the improvement in the current account, the sharp drop in net capital inflows resulted in a&#13;
reduction of US$69 million in net international reserves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.5    By the fourth quarter of 1995, the indications were clear that the economic deterioration&#13;
had ceased and that Argentina was pulling out of the recession. The stock and bond markets have&#13;
rebounded strongly, and deposits and international reserves have recovered the losses suffered&#13;
early in the crisis. The 1995 economic crisis was the first real test and validation of the&#13;
Convertibility Plan and, more importantly, a clear demonstration to investors, domestic and&#13;
international, of Argentina's commitment to the plan. Preliminary results for 1996 confirmed that&#13;
recession was over. Real GDP growth rate for 1996 is estimated to have reached 4 percent, with&#13;
inflation during this year almost nil (CPI increased 0.2% in 1996). Lagging fiscal revenues&#13;
showed signs of improvements, reflecting the increase in economic activity. Due to a relatively&#13;
higher increase in imports with respect to exports, the trade balance has been reduced to US$250&#13;
million in 1996.&#13;
1.6    At the provincial level, the 1995 national crisis aggravated an already problematic&#13;
situation. Faced with serious deterioration in their fiscal affairs, and social unrest in a number of&#13;
provinces, various provincial governments, assisted by the Federal Government's incremental&#13;
support to the provincial reform effort, accelerated their adjustment processes. Five provincial&#13;
banks were privatized (with another ten in the process of privatization), three social security&#13;
systems were transferred to the streamlined national system, and public salaries and staff levels&#13;
were cut. Additionally, of the total of 35 provincial public enterprises scheduled for privatization&#13;
in eight provinces, 17 were privatized by early 1996, and privatization laws have been passed for&#13;
the rest.&#13;
1.7    Between 1990 and 1993, Argentina's poverty level' declined from 35% to 20%. The&#13;
highest rates of poverty --averaging 40% --occurred in the Northern regions. As poverty declines&#13;
were greater in the metropolitan areas, the share of the nation's poor living in the north rose from&#13;
23% to 29%.2 In absolute numbers the urban poor represented three times the rural poor.&#13;
However, the incidence of poverty was higher in rural areas (34.2%) than in urban centers&#13;
(16.7%). Although there are not updated estimates for levels of poverty at the national level after&#13;
1993, partial data for the Buenos Aires metropolitan area 3 indicate that the percentage of the&#13;
population below the poverty line increased again. In the Gran Buenos Aires, it increased from&#13;
13.1% in 1993, to 18.2% in 1995.&#13;
B. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR: PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS&#13;
1.8    Argentina's agricultural sector has traditionally played a central role in the economy.&#13;
Presently, it contributes around 5% of GDP (down from around 15% in the late 1980s), provides&#13;
about 12% of total employment (plus another 22% in farm-related manufacturing, transportation&#13;
I The poor are classified as, and include: (a) indigent, or those whose income is insufficient to purchase a&#13;
minimum food basket; (b) the stagnant poor, or those whose income is insufficient to purchase the minimum&#13;
food basket and non-food consumption goods, and (c) vulnerable groups, or those whose incomes fluctuate&#13;
within the previously defined poverty band. Argentina 's Poor. A Profile, Report No. 13318-AR, World Bank,&#13;

and related services), and about 60% of export revenues from agricultural products and&#13;
manufactured products of agricultural origin. Argentina's more than 420,000 farms extend over&#13;
177 million ha. More than 30.7 million ha are cultivated, 91 million ha are natural pasture land;&#13;
37 rnillion ha are forested and the rest are used for non-agricultural purposes. Large and&#13;
extensive farms domninate, with 3.2% of the farrns (those with more than 2,500 ha) occupying&#13;
61% of the total farmland. On the other hand, nearly half the farms have under 50 ha, occupying&#13;
less than 8.5% of the area.&#13;
1.9   Cereals and oilseeds are the principal agricultural crops, the majority of which are&#13;
cultivated in the Pampas (very fertile, plain and temperate area covering the Province of Buenos&#13;
Aires, and parts of La Pampa, Santa Fe and Cordoba). In 1994/95, more than 20 million ha of&#13;
cereals and oilseeds were planted, occupying about two-thirds of the cultivated farm land. Other&#13;
important crops include cotton and sugar cane, both concentrated in the Northeast, yerba mate,&#13;
tobacco, and tea. Wine grapes are grown primarily in Mendoza, San Juan and other western&#13;
provinces. The Pampas support most of the national cattle herd of 52 million head. Sheep are&#13;
raised in Patagonia and the Pampas.&#13;
1.10  The prospects for sustained agricultural and agroindustrial growth are very promising.&#13;
The agricultural sector is highly competitive, receiving minimum public support, price subsidies or&#13;
trade protection to encourage production. The macroeconomic reforms removed many distortions&#13;
which had stultified sectoral investment and growth. Agricultural production costs are decreasing&#13;
due to declining freight and transport charges stemming from privatization of port facilities, the&#13;
elimnination of the diesel tax and lower import charges for fuel, seeds and other production inputs.&#13;
Liberalization of fertilizer and farm machinery imports have reduced costs to farmers, resulting in&#13;
stronger sales of tractors and increased fertilizer use. The expected impact of the GATT&#13;
Agreement and the reforms in the European Union have strengthened international price&#13;
projections for major Argentine agricultural export crops, especially cereals and oilseeds.&#13;
C. SECTORAL POTENTIAL AND CONSTRAINTS&#13;
1.11   Argentina has a significant comparative advantage in agricultural and agroindustrial&#13;
production. The country's rich soils and varied agro-climatic conditions permit the production of&#13;
a wide range of commodities. This ensures self-sufficiency in most foodstuffs, provides low-cost&#13;
raw materials for a developing agro-industrial complex, and allows the country to be a significant&#13;
factor in world markets for a number of products, especially cereals, oilseeds and beef In&#13;
addition, the country has great potential to diversify into the production and export of fruits,&#13;
vegetables, fisheries, and forestry products.&#13;
1.12  Despite its rich natural endowment, agriculture has been the slowest-growing sector in the&#13;
national economy. Between 1991 and 1994, the annual average sectoral growth rate was 1.13%,&#13;
compared with 7.7% for the national economy, 17.1% for construction, 9.3% for commercial&#13;
services, and 7% for manufacturing sectors. Agricultural growth has lagged due to exceptionally&#13;
low international prices during 1991-93 and high real domestic interest rates. Past discriminatory&#13;
policies against the sector, including heavy export taxation and an overvalued exchange rate,&#13;
combined with negligible capital investment in the sector, resulted in a land-extensive agriculture,&#13;
which offered few opportunities for a quick response to new macroeconomic conditions. With&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
the reduction in State subsidies and trade protection, regional economies, which had depended&#13;
upon a few non-competitive agricultural products, are experiencing significant adjustment&#13;
problems. For most of these farmers, the rise in the real exchange rate4 experienced since 1990&#13;
has decreased the prices they receive for their commodities compared with their costs of&#13;
production.&#13;
1.13  In addition, its deteriorated rural infrastructure, resulting from decades of public neglect&#13;
and minimum private investment, directly restricts agricultural production and productivity. More&#13;
than three-quarters of the national irrigation systems operate inefficiently due to poor maintenance&#13;
and management. Most irrigated areas are affected by impeded drainage and salinization. In&#13;
more humid areas, flooding, due to improperly maintained drainage systems, seriously threatens&#13;
agricultural production, forcing many farmners to permanently abandon agricultural pursuits.&#13;
1.14   Any long-term strategy of diversifying Argentina's agro-export mix to penetrate regional&#13;
and international markets would require overhauling the sectoral technical services, including&#13;
extension, health and quality control and export promotion, as well as investment in production&#13;
infrastructure and advanced technology. To expand market access, Argentina will need to comply&#13;
with international plant and animal health and sanitary standards. The presence of insects,&#13;
diseases and agro-chemical residue in Argentinean commodities precludes their entrance into&#13;
important and valuable markets. Also, many varieties produced, especially of fruits and&#13;
vegetables, fall below modern consumer quality standards. Extension efforts are needed to&#13;
encourage producers to upgrade traditional varieties to higher-valued ones.&#13;
1.15   Argentina animal health programs have made significant progress in their campaign to&#13;
eradicate Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), the presence of which excludes Argentinean fresh beef&#13;
from higher-value export markets. While large areas in Argentina have been FMD-free (with&#13;
vaccination) since 1992, until these areas are internationally certified as such, certain meats from&#13;
these zones cannot enter the FMD-free markets. Certification requires, inter alia, the&#13;
establishment and operation of a reliable, internationally acceptable, animal disease protection and&#13;
prevention system, involving, in some cases, the construction of laboratories and quarantine&#13;
stations.&#13;
1.16  Export market promotion services are also needed to help Argentina expand its world&#13;
market presence. Traditional Argentine agricultural exports, such as basic grains and oilseeds,&#13;
have required virtually no market promotion. To diversify agricultural exports and increase value&#13;
added, producers will need market information concerning international demand, technical&#13;
assistance to meet world market standards and shipment requirements, and investment capital.&#13;

D. DECENTRALIZATION OF DELIVERY OF PUBLIC AGRICULTURAL SERVICESS&#13;
1.17   As a result of sweeping reforms to decentralize, provinces are fast becoming the main&#13;
source of core public infrastructure and services, spending close to US$29 billion in 1995 (almost&#13;
10% of GDP and 40% of total public expenditure). In 1996, their share of public investment has&#13;
been estimated at around 70%. Provinces are now major providers of health, education, security,&#13;
water and sanitation, and economic development services. However, in the short-run, these&#13;
reforms have drastically reduced both the quality and scope of provincial agricultural support&#13;
services.&#13;
1.18   The Central Government, through the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and&#13;
Food (Secretaria de Agricultura, Ganaderia, Pescay Alimentaci6n, SAGPyA) of the Ministry of&#13;
Economy, and Works and Public Services (MEyOySP), formulates national agricultural policy&#13;
and legislation. It executes intra-provincial and intemational programs, such as quality standards&#13;
and grading for export products and consumer goods, and intra-provincial irrigation systems and&#13;
meat packing plants. National animal and plant health protection and sanitary campaigns are&#13;
administered by National Service for Food and Agricultural Sanitation and Quality (Servicio&#13;
Nacional de Sanidady CalidadAgroalimentaria, SENASA). The new SENASA was recently&#13;
established (by Presidential Decree dated 6/24/96) as an autonomous and autarkic institution in&#13;
the public domain of SAGPyA, by merging two similar institutions and assuming their roles and&#13;
responsibilities: the National Animal Health Service (ex-SENASA) and the National Institute for&#13;
Phytosanitary Health and Quality Control (IASCAV). The National Agricultural Technology&#13;
Institute (Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria, INTA) is responsible for basic&#13;
agricultural technological research and the provision of agricultural extension through its Regional&#13;
Centers.&#13;
1.19   The provinces, through their agricultural institutions, formulate agricultural provincial&#13;
policy and are responsible for agricultural research and extension, supervision of meat packing&#13;
plants, crop and animal disease control, and management and maintenance of irrigation systems at&#13;
the provincial level. These provincial agricultural institutions are loosely affiliated with the&#13;
SAGPyA through the Federal Agricultural Council (Consejo Federal Agropecuario, CFA). With&#13;
few exceptions, provincial support programs are restricted in scope, benefiting relatively few&#13;
farmers. To strengthen extension services, some provinces have recently entered into cooperative&#13;
agreements with specialized federal agencies, such as INTA. The exceptions are Mendoza and&#13;
Cordoba which have noteworthy provincial extension programs. Neuquen has an effective&#13;
network of local agricultural production centers. Water users' associations have different degrees&#13;
of organizational development. Most of them are rather weak and unskilled, and have little&#13;
experience with decentralized water management systems. The exceptions are the water users'&#13;
associations in Buenos Aires and Mendoza, which are relatively sophisticated and well connected&#13;
to the provincial governments.&#13;
The Argentine State is organized into three political-administrative and territorial jurisdictions: Central,&#13;
provincial and municipal levels. Within this organization, all government powers emanate from the&#13;
provinces whereby provinces delegate limited powers to the Central Government and retain for themselves all&#13;
other authority. Provinces are autonomous entities governed by their own Constitutions. Municipalities are&#13;
organized as part of each province's system of government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.20  Provinces have full jurisdiction over water matters (except navigational) and set water&#13;
users' tariffs. While a volumetric-based tariff could provide a closer estimate of the value of the&#13;
water used, tariffs for irrigation and drainage infrastructure improvements are currently based&#13;
upon area under irrigation. Some provinces with long experience in irrigation (e.g., Mendoza and&#13;
Rio Negro) are considering implementing a volumetric tariff system.&#13;
1.21   Lirnited experience as well as technical and financial constraints severely restrict the ability&#13;
of the provincial governments to effectively formulate agricultural plans, implement projects, and&#13;
deliver agricultural services. According to a recent study, the payrolls of the provincial&#13;
agricultural agencies are swollen with non-professional personnel, comprising between 50% and&#13;
85% of total staff. Low provincial salaries and weak career incentives attract few qualified&#13;
technicians and cause high professional turnover. These technical weaknesses, exacerbated by&#13;
poor communications among the various provincial agricultural agencies, contribute to the&#13;
inefficient allocation of scarce provincial resources6. Comprehensive measures, including better&#13;
personnel incentives, are urgently needed to improve management. Some provinces are seeking&#13;
ways to fulfill their obligations by reorganizing and strengthening institutions, working more&#13;
closely with the private sector and charging users the full economic value for previously&#13;
subsidized services.&#13;
E. PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN DELIVERY OF AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT SERVICES&#13;
1.22   The redefined role of the State is to provide only those essential services which, under&#13;
normal circumstances, are not provided by the private sector. This covers basic research, the&#13;
national agricultural database, animal and plant protection, sanitary and quality controls, and&#13;
international marketing promotion. Although there is a need to proceed gradually, the&#13;
government is transferring to the private sector the responsibility for irrigation and extension&#13;
services, the provision of which had been highly subsidized.&#13;
1.23   Existing provincial legislation permits cost recovery through taxation and beneficiary&#13;
charges. Nevertheless, the legislation is flexible, allowing the provincial government to determine&#13;
recovery terms on a case by case basis. As responsibility for irrigation 0 &amp; M is being transferred&#13;
to user groups, increasingly tariffs are being designed to not only recover 0 &amp; M and investment&#13;
costs, but to reflect the resource's economic value.&#13;
1.24  Extension services to small and medium farmers had been provided mainly by the public&#13;
sector. But, as a result of recent budgetary constraints, the coverage and quality of these services&#13;
has fallen dramatically. To address this, the government has instigated a pilot program, "Rural&#13;
Change" (Cambio Rural) which encourages gradual introduction of private extension services.&#13;
Under this program, farm groups, cooperatives and grower associations, through a competitive&#13;
selection process, directly contract private extension services. The government contribution,&#13;
which covers 80% of costs in the first year, declines to zero by the fifth year.&#13;

F. BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
1.25   Bank experience points to six elements essential for successful agricultural development&#13;
projects.' First, sound macroeconomic and sector policies, as reflected in a country's public&#13;
expenditure program, create a project-enabling environment, reducing tendencies to overburden&#13;
projects with multiple objectives. Second, intensive consultation with beneficiaries build needed&#13;
consensus, support for project objectives and facilitate corrective measures during&#13;
implementation. Third, a phased approach, which begins at project preparation with building a&#13;
subproject pipeline, reduces the risk of disbursement bottlenecks at project start-up. Fourth,&#13;
project scale must conform to the implementing agency's institutional capacity. Fifth, while&#13;
project design should be flexible, objectives and indicators need to be clearly defined. Finally,&#13;
subprojects need to be technically and economically sound.&#13;
1.26   Institutional Development. Institutional development has been a common feature of&#13;
Bank operations because to a great extent the sustainability of development depends on the&#13;
character and performance of institutions. While components aimed at strengthening institutions&#13;
figured in a high proportion of Bank-financed operations, and the approaches used have been&#13;
diverse, many such components have failed to have lasting effects.&#13;
1.27   Bank projects administered by competent institutions tend also to have healthy economic&#13;
rates of return. Technical assistance is the mechanism most commonly used in Bank projects to&#13;
strengthen institutions, but the Bank's experience has been mixed. Effective technical assistance&#13;
programs have tended to be flexible, based closely on the beneficiary's needs and skills, subject to&#13;
frequent review, modification, and supervision, and focused on strengthening technical,&#13;
managerial, or administrative systems. Institutional analysis up-front is essential8. Priorities ought&#13;
to be promoting the use of more creative technical assistance delivery mechanisms, and expanding&#13;
local consultant capacity. Attention to legal issues is also important, including the regulatory&#13;
framework in which projects are carried out; the rules that define the powers, functions, and&#13;
responsibilities of institutions as well as their interrelationships; and legal measures to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of institutions.&#13;
1.28   Private Sector Involvement. Bank experience demonstrates that the search for greater&#13;
efficiency may involve privatization, and agricultural projects should strive to integrate the private&#13;
sector wherever possible, limiting government's role to a narrower focus on: (i) creating an&#13;
enabling policy framework for production and market efficiency; (ii) funding public goods,&#13;
principally in agricultural research and extension, and rural infrastructure, and leaving their&#13;
delivery, operation and maintenance, wherever feasible, to private agents, (iii) funding targeted&#13;
interventions needed to correct market failures and address acute poverty or food security issues,&#13;

but devolving their execution to private entities; and (iv) building institutional capacity so that&#13;
public sector services are carried out efficiently9.&#13;
1.29   Years of public neglect and insufficient 0 &amp; M by users have resulted in improper&#13;
maintenance and badly deteriorated irrigation systems. Transferring state-owned and&#13;
state-managed systems to user groups would require infrastructure rehabilitation before users&#13;
would take charge of the systems. Further, the capacity of users to self-manage systems must be&#13;
upgraded, through technical assistance arrangements specifically designed for their needs.&#13;
1.30   Beneficiary Participation. The experience of several multilateral agencies, including the&#13;
Bank, shows that beneficiary participation is a crucial factor for project success and&#13;
sustainabilityl°. A review of selected Bank projects reveals a strong association between&#13;
participation and project effectiveness. It has been observed that beneficiary participation allows&#13;
a better definition of project components and activities, since it ensures that beneficiaries' points&#13;
of view on priority objectives are properly considered in project operation and implementation.&#13;
Participation prompts the development of ownership and increases the responsibility of the&#13;
intended beneficiaries contributing towards long-term sustainability.&#13;
1.31  Marketing and Technology. Marketing services are an area in which government's role&#13;
remains critical: in the modernization of marketing facilities; in market information services,&#13;
grower organization and access to international markets; and the establishment of standards and&#13;
grades to lower transaction costs and open opportunities." Well-designed and applied&#13;
agricultural technology is essential for agricultural development. Public, private and NGO&#13;
research efforts should be amalgamated, in order to identify and alleviate gaps impeding greater&#13;
productivity in areas which have special promise. Technology transfer programs should match&#13;
local fiscal, institutional and human resources, as well as existing farm conditions, and should be&#13;
designed with the participation of all stakeholders.&#13;
1.32   Irrigation Lending. The Bank's Water Resource Management Policy (WRMP) proposes&#13;
a view of water as an economic good, decentralized water management and delivery models,&#13;
greater reliance on pricing, and the fill participation of water users2. The lessons emphasize&#13;
institutional strengthening to improve coordination and analysis, stated to be especially important&#13;
in countries like Argentina, whose political structure gives primary authority over water to&#13;
provincial governments. Also stressed are technological research and lower-cost rehabilitation.&#13;

1.33   The Bank experience13 and the WRMP advocate decentralizing responsibility and&#13;
transferring irrigation service delivery to the private sector, by relying on water user associations.&#13;
Water user associations have proven effective in the Argentine Province of Mendoza where&#13;
traditional associations, covering relatively small areas, could not meet costs, and efficiency and&#13;
maintenance suffered. Their amalgamation into larger associations enabled them to generate their&#13;
own budgets, regulate their activities, and hire professional managers to handle cost recovery,&#13;
water delivery, and maintenance. Lower costs resulted from fewer, larger associations, and water&#13;
distribution improved markedly.&#13;
1.34   Cost Recovery. Evaluations of Bank experience with irrigation and other agricultural&#13;
services world-wide indicate that cost recovery from beneficiaries has been usually insufficient to&#13;
cover 0 &amp; M costs and has rarely contributed to capital costs'4. Vaguely worded project&#13;
documents concerning cost recovery and inadequate institutional arrangements certainly&#13;
contribute to poor recovery rates."5. Bank experience has demonstrated that cost recovery and&#13;
O &amp; M often improve when these responsibilities are performed with a strong element of water&#13;
16&#13;
users' participation . In this regard, experience indicates that successful projects tend to give&#13;
emphasis to ensure effective cost recovery by transferring to the water users responsibility for&#13;
tariff collection and systems' 0 &amp; M.&#13;
G. BANK LENDING IN ARGENTINA&#13;
1.35   The current lending portfolio in Argentina comprises 32 loans, principally in the&#13;
infrastructure and financial sectors, totaling US$5.4 billion. The First Provincial Development&#13;
Project approved in FY91 (PDP-I, Loan 3280-AR) for US$200 million, cofinanced with the&#13;
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), played a key role in Government's provincial reform.&#13;
In 1994, the Provincial Reform Project for US$300 million (Loan 3836-AR) was approved to&#13;
improve provincial expenditure efficiency. The Second Provincial Development Project,&#13;
approved in FY95 (PDP-II, Loan 3877-AR) for US$321 million, will continue to assist in the&#13;
transfer of fiscal and administrative reforms from the national to the provincial levels and in&#13;
improving the fiscal situation.&#13;
1.36   The Bank has undertaken eight operations in the agriculture sector since 1967, five of&#13;
which are closed. The most recent agricultural projects are the following: (a) the Agricultural&#13;
Credit II Project (Loan 2970-AR, closed in 1993), oriented toward small and medium&#13;
export-oriented farmers, which successfully increased sectoral capital investments and producer&#13;
confidence during a period of macroeconomic instability and hyper-inflation, (b) the on-going&#13;
Agricultural Services and Institutional Development Project (PROMSA-Loan 3297-AR), which&#13;
was approved in FY91 and is jointly financed with the IDB, has been supporting the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. ORIGIN AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1   The provinces have requested the Central Government to establish a mechanism to&#13;
strengthen agricultural support services and finance investment projects considered to have high&#13;
priority to promote provincial development in the rural areas. Consequently, the Government of&#13;
Argentina (GOA) requested that the Bank and IDB, based upon their previous experience in&#13;
Argentina, provide a comprehensive framework for supporting provincial agricultural&#13;
development, combining substantial support for provincial institutional strengthening and&#13;
development with funding for priority investments. Strong Bank support of the agricultural&#13;
sector is warranted given the significant opportunities it offers for environmentally sustainable&#13;
economic growth, increase employment, and foreign exchange eamings. Bank intervention can&#13;
play a catalytic role in rationalizing public sector investment, strengthening key institutions,&#13;
stimulating private sector investment, and increasing exports.&#13;
2.2   The proposed project fully supports the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),&#13;
discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on May 4, 1995, and the progress report discussed&#13;
on April 25, 1996, by helping Argentina to: (i) consolidate recent macroeconomic reforms&#13;
through economic growth; (ii) reduce poverty and unemployment; and (iii) rebuild infrastructure.&#13;
The project would foster economic growth through improved international competitiveness;&#13;
reduce rural poverty by increasing small farmer incomes and rural employment and rehabilitate&#13;
rural infrastructure, particularly irrigation and drainage, flood control and feeder roads.&#13;
2.3   The project would build upon the progress made in the Provincial Development Projects&#13;
(PDP I and II) by improving the technical quality of the provincial governments' investment&#13;
proposals. By encouraging more appropriate user tariffs and a greater private sector&#13;
participation, the project would increase the financial autonomy of provincial service providers.&#13;
As a result, the public sector would be able to concentrate more on policy issues with broader and&#13;
more long-term implications, such as environmental issues.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.4   The main development objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) increase and&#13;
diversify agricultural production and exports, through intensifying land use, increasing&#13;
productivity per hectare, as well as introducing new crops and modern varieties, (b) increase and&#13;
stabilize the agricultural incomes of about 120,000 small and medium-sized commercial farms,&#13;
(c) improve the effectiveness of basic agricultural support services to increase the international&#13;
competitiveness of agricultural products, by introducing new and more productive technologies,&#13;
increasing quality and improving sanitary conditions of products, and eradicating diseases that&#13;
limit access to international markets; (d) improve rural productive infrastructure to reduce&#13;
production and marketing costs, through a significant reduction in the risk of losses (crops,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
livestock, equipment and facilities), as well as more efficient use and better conservation and&#13;
management of natural resources; (e) strengthen national and provincial institutional capacity to&#13;
formulate and analyze sectoral development policy, as well as to identify, prepare and implement&#13;
investment projects; and (f) rationalize public investments and promote an expanded private&#13;
sector role (e.g. farmers' organizations, NGOs, and service providers) in agricultural development.&#13;
C. SUMMARY PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.5   To achieve its objectives, the project would:&#13;
(a)   finance subprojects (about 93% of project costs), presented by the participating&#13;
provinces in accordance with their priorities, development strategies and&#13;
investment plans, and which satisfy the eligibility criteria established for the&#13;
Project. Most of these subprojects would be provincial initiatives to be&#13;
implemented at the local level by a provincial executing agency. However, in&#13;
special cases in which several provinces need to address a common regional issue&#13;
by coordinated actions, the proposed project would finance national subprojects&#13;
with multi-provincial coverage. In these cases, the implementation of the&#13;
subprojects would be under the coordination of a executing agency with regional&#13;
or national coverage to achieve overall consistency at the national level, increase&#13;
effectiveness, and take advantage of potential externalities. Provisionally, the&#13;
amount of subprojects to be implemented by a single province would be limited to&#13;
25% of total project costs, and the total amount of the national subprojects to be&#13;
approved during the life of the project would be restricted to 30% of total project&#13;
costs.&#13;
(b)   strengthen institutional development (about 2% of project costs), both at the&#13;
national and at the provincial levels, to: (i) establish permanent operational&#13;
mechanisms for supporting implementation of the proposed project; (ii) help&#13;
define the role of the public sector and increase coordination between different&#13;
public and private entities to increase their effectiveness; (iii) increase capacity to&#13;
formulate and analyze agricultural policy, as well as to design legal and&#13;
institutional reforms, which would facilitate the transfer of responsibilities to users'&#13;
groups and promote sectoral development; and (iv) identify, prepare and&#13;
implement agricultural development initiatives, promoting an increased&#13;
participation of the private sector.&#13;
(c)   provide project coordination and management, and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
(M&amp;E) (about 5% of project costs), at the national and provincial levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. MAIN AREAS OF INTERVENTION&#13;
2.6    The project would consider all technically feasible, economically sound, and&#13;
environmentally sustainable subproject proposals presented by the provinces, based on their&#13;
priorities and implementing capacities, and when consistent with the project's objectives and&#13;
eligibility criteria. However, based on diagnostic studies carried out by the provinces and on the&#13;
review of extensive lists of subproject profiles presented by these provinces during preparation, it&#13;
is expected that the project would concentrate mainly on the following areas of intervention:&#13;
(a)    Water resource management, which would include: (i) rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of existing irrigation, drainage and flood control schemes;&#13;
(ii) training and technical assistance in water resource management and irrigation&#13;
system maintenance; (iii) water management technology development; and&#13;
(iv) establishment of watershed management systems.&#13;
(b)    Rural infrastructure, which would rehabilitate and improve other type of rural&#13;
infrastructure, including inter-alia, feeder roads, rural electrification and marketing&#13;
structures.&#13;
(c)    Technological development, which would improve the delivery of basic support&#13;
services related to the generation and transfer of technology. In addition, it would&#13;
emphasize an increased private sector participation in the delivery of these&#13;
services, through hiring of the best potential supplier through competitive selection&#13;
processes.&#13;
(d)   Animal health, which would strengthen programs to protect livestock against&#13;
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), tuberculosis, brucellosis, scabies, mange, ticks&#13;
and other diseases affecting animal productivity, through (i) eradication campaigns;&#13;
(ii) establishment of systems to prevent reintroduction of disease; (iii) development&#13;
of early warning systems to detect re-entry; (iv) establishment of internationally&#13;
certified disease free zones. The project would support either federal or provincial&#13;
animal health entities and other national and provincial programs, public and&#13;
private, involved in animal health and sanitary safety.&#13;
(e)    Plant health and commodity quality, which would include the strengthening of:&#13;
(i) disease identification and eradication (or control), (ii) early warning systems;&#13;
(iii) crop health extension; (iv) biological and integrated pest management and&#13;
control; (v) registration of marketing and transport, and agrochemical use;&#13;
(vi) monitoring agro-chemical residues; (vii) training in rational agro-chemical use;&#13;
(viii) certification of phytosanitary quality; (ix) seed certification; (x) control and&#13;
registration of marketing and transport of genetic and plant material;&#13;
(xi) phytosanitary barriers; and (xii) chemical control of plant disease and&#13;
sicknesses. According to studies carried out and demands presented by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
provinces, the project would probably concentrate on the eradication and control&#13;
of citrus canker, the Mediterranean fruit fly, the fruit "black spot" and the boll&#13;
weevil, with the objective of obtaining international certification for "disease-free"&#13;
areas.&#13;
(f)    Market development, which would provide assistance in the formulation of&#13;
provincial export promotion strategies by identifying markets, establishing market&#13;
contacts and specifying marketing conditions and requirements.&#13;
(g)   Agricultural information, which would help design, establish and develop a&#13;
national integrated agricultural information system, at the provincial and federal&#13;
levels, to provide valuable information to the public.&#13;
(h)   Production and regulation offoodproducts, supporting SAGPyA's new&#13;
responsibilities related to technological development, regulation and quality control&#13;
of food products.&#13;
(i)    Strengthening ofprovincial agricultural institutions, which would emphasize&#13;
project identification, preparation and implementation. In addition, the project&#13;
would improve agricultural policy design, strategy formulation and evaluation,&#13;
involving institution-building and strengthening.&#13;
E. PROVINCIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA&#13;
2.7   Every province would be eligible to participate in the project's institutional development&#13;
component and receive technical assistance from the components to be implemented by the&#13;
national government. However, in order to be eligible to receive a subloan for financing a specific&#13;
provincial subproject, participating provinces would have to satisfy the eligibility criteria specified&#13;
in the Project Operational Manual (POM), and acceptable to the Bank. These eligibility criteria&#13;
must be consistent with the strategy agreed between the Bank and GOA in terms of the need to&#13;
ensure provincial creditworthiness and support improvements in the provincial fiscal situation.&#13;
These criteria for different type of subprojects are presented in the following paragraphs.&#13;
2.8   Sublending to Provinces for Technical Assistance and Institutional Strengthening.&#13;
Where a provincial government assumes the responsibility for a subloan to implement a subproject&#13;
that includes only technical assistance and institutional strengthening, the province would be&#13;
required to have: (i) provincial legislative approval to accept the subloan (Ley Provincial de&#13;
Endeudamiento); (ii) a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the Federal Government, conforming to&#13;
provincial law and acceptable to the Bank; and (iii) an adequately staffed provincial agricultural&#13;
authority, legally and technically capable of administering the subloan, and of implementing the&#13;
subproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2.9    Sublending to Provinces for Implementation of Investment Subprojects. In addition&#13;
to the above conditions, where a province or a group of provinces seek funds for investment&#13;
subprojects, each province would need to have: (i) a current account fiscal balance 17 in the most&#13;
recent full provincial budget period; and (ii) a debt service ratio below 15 percent 18. As an&#13;
exception, only in the case of investment subprojects involving the rehabilitation of existing rural&#13;
productive infrastructure, a province unable to satisfy these general conditions would be required&#13;
to have a written agreement with the Federal Government to implement a Provincial Reform&#13;
Program, acceptable to the Bank, demonstrating that it would be in a position to meet the&#13;
requirements within a specified time period.&#13;
2.10   Subprojects to be Implemented by the Central Government. Where the Central&#13;
government assumes responsibility for the loan proceeds for financing a national subproject, under&#13;
the coordination and administration of specialized federal agencies, participating provinces would&#13;
not need to satisfy the eligibility criteria applicable to direct provincial subloans described above.&#13;
F. SUBPROJECT SELECTION PROCESS AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA&#13;
2.11   All eligible provinces could approach the Project's Central Coordinating Unit (UEC) with&#13;
subproject ideas. If the idea is considered promising and consistent with the national and&#13;
provincial priorities, the UEC could finance pre-feasibility studies required to continue the analysis&#13;
of the idea. The UEC would assess the feasibility study against the subproject selection criteria to&#13;
determine if the subproject would be included in the pipeline for further consideration. Each&#13;
subproject proposal would be assessed and rated based on the selection criteria, to compete&#13;
against all other proposals presented on the basis of the following characteristics:&#13;
-  Technical Feasibility: The subproject should be technically sound, incorporating&#13;
technologies that not only represent the state-of-the-art, but are also appropriate, given the&#13;
economic and social conditions of the beneficiaries and cost-effectiveness considerations.&#13;
-  Financial Viability: The subproject's net income generation would need to be sufficient to&#13;
adequately cover, at least, administrative and 0 &amp; M costs, and to certain extent, investment&#13;
costs.&#13;
*  Scale and Coverage. The proposal should be in agreement with the objectives defined and&#13;
based on the location and extent of the problem it intends to address.&#13;
17 Defined as a current account fiscal balance, excluding from current revenues all discretionary grants and&#13;
"aportes".&#13;
18 Debt service ratio is defined as interest plus amortization, over current revenues, excluding discretionaty&#13;
grants and "aportes", on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
*  Environmental Impact: The subproject would need to improve or protect natural resources&#13;
and biodiversity. If potential negative effects are detected, it would have to include adequate&#13;
mitigatory measures.&#13;
*  Implementation Capacity: The institutional requirements of the subproject must fall within&#13;
the capacity of the proposed executing agency, the provinces and other entities related to&#13;
subproject implementation.&#13;
* Economic Return: The subproject would need to be economically sound, with an internal&#13;
economic rate of return of at least 12% when benefits are measurable in economic terms.&#13;
* Beneficiary Participation: Strong beneficiary participation in subproject identification,&#13;
preparation, implementation, 0 &amp; M and long-term administration would be essential.&#13;
*  Social Impact. The proposed subproject would be reviewed to assess potential social impacts&#13;
on the beneficiaries and the entire population in the sector that may be affected by its actions.&#13;
If potential negative effects are detected on any group or sector of the society, adequate&#13;
mitigatory or compensatory measures would be included.&#13;
G. SELECTION OF PRIORITY SUBPROJECTS&#13;
2.12   During project preparation, provincial governments drafted and finalized Provincial&#13;
Strategies and Development Plans, containing long-term objectives, plans and programs to be&#13;
pursued in their agricultural sector. On the basis of these Plans, the provinces formulated and&#13;
submitted over 200 subproject ideas to the project preparation team. As most of these ideas&#13;
represented long-standing provincial needs, many proposals had well-developed studies and a few&#13;
had completed feasibility studies.&#13;
2.13   For these proposals, the preparation team carried out a preliminary review of, inter-alia,&#13;
their technical quality, financial sustainability, economic efficiency and expected economic returns,&#13;
provincial commitment, environmental effects, level of beneficiary participation, legal&#13;
requirements, and complementarity with other initiatives undertaken by the private and public&#13;
sectors. Based on this review, 40 subprojects were identified for further analysis.&#13;
2.14   These 40 subproject ideas were assessed more carefully and classified on the basis of the&#13;
ratings assigned according to the eligibility criteria previously presented. The first group of&#13;
subprojects consisted of those not only the most advanced, but also those which best satisfied&#13;
project eligibility criteria and with the highest developmental impact. These tended to be&#13;
proposals from provincial clients with the most experience in project preparation and the strongest&#13;
project administrative skills. Top priority has been given to finalizing feasibility studies and&#13;
engineering designs for 11 of these subprojects, so that they would be ready for implementation&#13;
immediately after loan effectiveness. These 11 subprojects were classified as Group A. There is&#13;
a close second group, labeled as Group B, with similar characteristics and requiring more time to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
prepare. Preparation for some of these subprojects in Group B continued, although at a slower&#13;
pace. From this Group B, about six to eight of the subprojects have feasibility studies moving&#13;
forward, and could be ready to start implementation within two years after project effectiveness.&#13;
2.15  Preparing a pipeline and appraising subproject proposals, including full feasibility studies&#13;
and final engineering designs, served the purpose of obtaining a better estimate of project costs&#13;
and benefits. Since the subprojects appraised could be considered representative of the types of&#13;
investments the project would finance throughout its implementation, by appraising these&#13;
subprojects, it was possible to understand better the economic, social and environmental viability&#13;
of the project as whole. In addition, having a group of subprojects prepared in advance facilitates&#13;
implementation at least for the first two years, and contributes to ensuring a stable flow of&#13;
disbursements.&#13;
2.16  However, having prepared these subprojects does not restrict the proposed project from&#13;
considering and funding other subproject proposals. The project has no strict funding target, in&#13;
terms of geographic location or subsector, and is open to the review and financing of any&#13;
subproject meeting the selection criteria, proposed by any eligible province or the Central&#13;
government. The types of subprojects approved would be subject to close monitoring with the&#13;
intention of avoiding concentration of subprojects in a few provinces or in the same executing&#13;
agencies. As a preliminary goal to be closely monitored by the UEC, the amount of approved&#13;
subprojects in a single province would be limited to 25% of the total project costs. Similarly, the&#13;
amount of subprojects to be implemented by the federal government would be limited to 30% of&#13;
total project costs.&#13;
2.17  During implementation, the eligible provinces would present subproject proposals to&#13;
compete for project funds. With assistance and guidance to be provided by the UEC, the&#13;
provinces would submit these proposals to the SAGPyA, consistent with their provincial&#13;
strategies and development plans. Based on the technical assessment carried out by the UEC,&#13;
SAGPyA, in consultation with the Federal Agricultural Council (CFA), would approve financing&#13;
of the following phase. For approval of a subloan to proceed with implementation, the subproject&#13;
would require a full feasibility study (as well as complete engineering designs, when applicable),&#13;
including detailed economic, institutional and environmental analyses.&#13;
H. GROUP A SUBPROJECTS&#13;
2.18  The Group A is formed by the 11 subprojects with feasibility studies that were reviewed&#13;
at appraisal. Seven of these subprojects are intended to be financed by the Bank loan--four&#13;
provincial irrigation subprojects and three regional subprojects (animal health and phytosanitary&#13;
services). The main features of these seven subprojects to be financed by the Bank loan are&#13;
summarized in Table 2.1. The other four subprojects (three irrigation and drainage, and one&#13;
national agricultural information) are to be financed by a loan from the Inter-American&#13;
Development Bank (IDB). A detailed description of all these subprojects is presented in&#13;
Annex B. The detailed funding arrangements for these Group A subprojects between the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
the IDB and the governments, are presented in the Project Cost and Financing sections of this&#13;
report (paras. 2.24-2.28 and Annexes C and D).&#13;

I. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
2.19   To help develop institutional capacities at both the federal and provincial levels, as well as&#13;
support subproject implementation, the project would support an institutional development&#13;
component (IDC), in which all provinces would be eligible to participate, whether they have&#13;
already presented an investment subproject or not. The primary purpose of the component is to&#13;
ensure sound subproject implementation, as well as to install within the provincial institutions the&#13;
capacity to adequately support the agricultural sector. The IDC would also strengthen provincial&#13;
programming capacities to develop an efficient system of agricultural policy, program and project&#13;
formulation and analysis. This component would combine extensive technical assistance to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
provincial entities with training for managerial and technical provincial staff (see Annex H), and&#13;
would be implemented by the Federal Government through SAGPyA/UEC.&#13;
2.20  This project component would assist in the establishment of permanent operational&#13;
mechanisms between the SAGPyA and its the decentralized agencies regarding project&#13;
implementation. The component would strengthen the coordination between the project and:&#13;
(i) other secretaries of the Ministry of Economy and Public Works and Services (MEyOySP), to&#13;
ensure that project activities are consistent with national priorities; (ii) decentralized SAGPyA&#13;
agencies; (iii) INDEC, with respect to the Agricultural Information System (SIIA); and (iv) the&#13;
Ministry of the Interior, regarding the utilization of the Technical Units (UTPs) established under&#13;
PDP I and II, in the administration of funds and the establishment of a proper accounting system.&#13;
On a national level, the component would also strengthen the CFA, clearly defining its functions,&#13;
especially regarding the allocation of external financial resources for implementation of&#13;
development and social projects.&#13;
2.21   At the provincial level, this component would: (i) coordinate the different agricultural&#13;
executive entities to define policies and plans to be included in the POA; (ii) define the functions&#13;
and relationships of the public sector institutions; (iii) define the responsibilities and obligations&#13;
for each institution participating in project as would be formalized in the Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement; and (iv) formalize agreements between the official sector and the beneficiary producer&#13;
groups.&#13;
2.22  At the operational level, the component would: (i) establish and support the Project&#13;
organizational structure, defining the institutional relations and responsibilities; (ii) improve&#13;
institutional capacity to adopt and enforce the Project Operational Manual, and the Environmental&#13;
Manual; (iii) improve the physical infrastructure and the technical operational capabilities of the&#13;
coordinating units, and help provide the technical assistance required for an effective&#13;
implementation; (iv) provide assistance to executing agencies in the implementation of different&#13;
subprojects; (v) assist in the formulation of Subsidiary Loan Agreements; (vi) ensure that the&#13;
procedures for implementation, procurement, competitive bidding and evaluation are followed&#13;
according to the provisions of the Loan Agreement and Subsidiary Loan Agreements; and&#13;
(vii) support and assist in the preparation of the Annual Operating Plans (POAs) and the progress&#13;
reports.&#13;
J. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
2.23   The total estimated project cost would be US$357.2 million equivalent over a seven-year&#13;
implementation period. This total project cost includes allowances for physical contingencies of&#13;
US$20.6 million (5.8% of total costs) and for price contingencies (domestic plus international&#13;
inflation) of US$26.5 million (7.4% of total cost), as well as taxes and duties estimated at&#13;
US$41.5 million (11.6% of total cost). The main investment categories would be: (i) civil works,&#13;
US$124.8 million (35% of total costs); (ii) vehicles and equipment, US$38.8 million (10.9%);&#13;
(iii) consulting and auditing services and technical assistance, US$72.8 million (20.3%);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
(iv) training and institutional development, US$12.1 million (3.4%); (v) incremental local staff,&#13;
US$50.3 million (14.1%); and (vi) operation and maintenance, materials and supplies, and&#13;
miscellaneous, US$58.4 million (16.3%). Project costs are summarized in Table 2.2 and details&#13;
are presented in Annexes C and D.&#13;
2.24  From the total project cost estimated at US$357.2 million equivalent, the Bank and the&#13;
IDB would finance US$125 million each, representing a total of about 70% of project cost. The&#13;
national and provincial governments would provide about US$90.0 million as counterpart funding&#13;
from their own budgets (about 25.2%), and the remaining US$17.2 million (4.8%) would be&#13;
financed directly by the beneficiaries. Project financing between the Bank and the EDB would be&#13;
done in parallel, with each donor financing separate subprojects. The exceptions would be the&#13;
institutional development component (IDC), and the coordination and management components&#13;
(federal and provincial), in which the Bank would finance technical assistance and consultants,&#13;
and the IDB would finance all other categories within these components. A summary financing&#13;
plan is presented in Table 2.3 and details are included in Annex C and D.&#13;
2.25  The loan would be made at the Bank's standard variable interest rate for currency pool&#13;
loans, with repayment in 15 years, including five years of grace, with loan amortization based on&#13;
level repayment of principal.&#13;
2.26 The provinces would assume responsibility for repayment to the Central Government for&#13;
loan proceeds on-lent to them for financing provincial subprojects. The Central Government&#13;
would assume sole responsibility for the loan proceeds which finance regional or national&#13;
subprojects, implemented by or under the coordination of specialized federal agencies.&#13;
Regardless of the funding sources (Bank or IDB), repayment by the provinces would be made&#13;
over 18 years, with five years of grace, at the average of the terms for the Bank and the IDB&#13;
loans, including the foreign currency risk and the commitment fees. The commitment fees to be&#13;
paid by the provinces would be based on the amount of their subloans, starting on the date of the&#13;
signature of the corresponding Subsidiary Loan Agreement with GOA. The provinces would&#13;
guarantee repayment with their shares of funds from federally-collected taxes (Fondos de&#13;
Coparticipaci6n).&#13;
2.27  A Tripartite Consultative Group (TCG), composed by representatives of GOA, IDB and&#13;
the Bank, would meet every six months during the course of the normal supervision missions to&#13;
review project performance, analyze problems and solutions, propose future activities, analyze the&#13;
pipeline of new subproject proposals, as well as discuss the approval of subprojects submitted to&#13;
SAGPyA. This consultative mechanism would review the pipeline of new subproject proposals&#13;
and provide guidance to SAGPyA to identify and solve potential issues.&#13;

K. SUBPROJECTS COST RECOVERY&#13;
2.28   Cost recovery systems have been in operation for all the irrigation and drainage schemes&#13;
for a long time, achieving, in some of them, relatively high recovery rates. Building on this&#13;
experience, the Project would help strengthen these mechanisms to be able to increase their&#13;
effectiveness and ensure a substantial level of cost recovery directly from the beneficiaries. Every&#13;
investment subproject producing direct benefits for the private sector would include a cost&#13;
recovery plan and time schedule, including agreements on the mechanisms for establishing or&#13;
improving the existing cost recovery system. These agreements would be one of the conditions&#13;
for approving the specific Subsidiary Loan Agreement for that subproject and, therefore, for the&#13;
disbursement of funds for its implementation. These agreements would specify the rates and&#13;
tariffs needed to cover operational, administrative and maintenance costs, and when feasible, a&#13;
substantial percentage of the investment costs, based on a realistic assessment of the beneficiaries'&#13;
repayment capacity.&#13;
2.29  For water infrastructure rehabilitation and construction, especially irrigation, beneficiaries&#13;
would be expected to recover all 0 &amp; M costs sufficient to sustain efficient operation. Generally,&#13;
the provincial government would absorb between 20 and 40% of the investment costs, and the&#13;
remainder would be covered through users' tariffs and rates to be paid directly by the farmers.&#13;
The actual rate of investment cost recovery to be achieved for each subproject would depend on:&#13;
(i) the current situation of the physical infrastructure and the type of investment required; (ii) the&#13;
estimated rate of return of the investment; (iii) the actual beneficiaries' repayment capacity; and&#13;
(iv) the provincial legislation on cost recovery and real capacity to cover part of the investment&#13;
costs. The project would strengthen the capacity of existing water users' associations to assess&#13;
and collect water tariffs from members and implement, either directly or through contracted&#13;
services, regular operation and maintenance.&#13;
2.30  In the Rio Colorado Valley Subproject (Province of Buenos Aires), beneficiaries, through&#13;
the Water Users Association and CORFO-RC, would recover full 0 &amp; M costs as well as part of&#13;
the investments costs. Up to 60% of capital costs would be repaid over time and included in the&#13;
irrigation water tariff. Economic projections indicate that the increased income and reduction in&#13;
production costs from a more efficient irrigation system would allow farmers to finance these&#13;
investment costs. In the Pozo Borrado Flood Control Subproject (Province of Santa Fe), the&#13;
Watershed Committees, with demonstrated experience in implementing flood control works and&#13;
obtaining financing through beneficiary tariffs, would ensure full 0 &amp; M and 80% of capital cost&#13;
recovery. In the Province of Mendoza, in accordance with existing provincial water legislation,&#13;
DGI would recover full O&amp;M costs and the goal for investment cost recovery would be 60% for&#13;
the Montecaseros Irrigation and Drainage Subproject, and 80% for the investments carried out by&#13;
the Small Works Rehabilitation Fund (Fondo de Rehabilitacion de Obras Menores). The goals to&#13;
be sought under the proposed project for each specific subproject are presented in Table 2.4.&#13;

' For investment financed by the Small Works Rehabilitation Fund&#13;
2.31   In animal and plant health protection and quality control subprojects, beneficiaries would&#13;
pay for the services provided through service fees, which would be used to recover operational&#13;
costs and ensure sustainability of the programs. In the Animal Health Subprojects in&#13;
Mesopotamia and Patagonia, livestock producers would pay all operational costs, through service&#13;
fees for vaccines, vaccinations and monitoring and surveillance. Similarly, in the Phytosanitary&#13;
Subproject in the Northwest Region, fruit growers would finance subproject operational costs&#13;
through services fees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.1   Institutional Framework for Implementation. The Secretariat of Agriculture,&#13;
Livestock, Fisheries and Food (SAGPyA), within the Ministry of Economy, would have overall&#13;
responsibility for project implementation, coordination and management. Under the ongoing&#13;
PROMSA project (Loan 3297-AR), SAGPyA has demonstrated adequate capacity for project&#13;
coordination and administration. The Federal Agricultural Council (Consejo Federal&#13;
Agropecuario, CFA), chaired by the Secretary of SAGPyA and including the provincial&#13;
authorities in charge of the agricultural sector, is a forum for discussion of sectoral policies and&#13;
strategies between the central government and the provinces. In relation to the proposed project,&#13;
the CFA would act as an advisory body, ensuring that project objectives and strategies are&#13;
consistent across provinces and helping coordinate procedures. In addition, the CFA would also&#13;
serve to promote dissemination and exchange of information, allowing an intensive sharing of&#13;
experiences and lessons learned during implementation, and increasing participation by the&#13;
provinces. In order to support this function, the CFA would create a Provincial Advisory&#13;
Committee (Comision Asesora Provincial, CAP), chaired by the Secretary of SAGPyA and&#13;
including six annually-rotating members of the CFA. The CAP would meet regularly to analyze&#13;
project implementation, including the pipeline of subloans, suggest changes in procedures, analyze&#13;
specific implementation issues and recommend corrective measures.&#13;
3.2   Within the SAGPyA's Undersecretariat for Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry&#13;
(Subsecretaria de Agricultura, Ganaderia y Forestaci6n-SSAGyF), the Central Coordinating&#13;
Unit (UnidadEjecutora Central, UEC), would coordinate project implementation, and would be&#13;
responsible for overall financial administration and management, as well as project monitoring.&#13;
The UEC would build on the experience gained during the successful implementation of the&#13;
ongoing PROMSA project, taking advantage of procedures and mechanisms already in place, but&#13;
also including substantial strengthening in key areas. It would consist of an Executive&#13;
Coordinator (Coordinador Ejecutivo), and about 16 technical staff in five Technical Units and an&#13;
Advisory Group. The internal organization would be the following:&#13;
(a)   Administrative Unit, involving an Unit Chief, two Accountants, and a Financial&#13;
and Auditing Specialist;&#13;
(b)   Subprojects Management Unit, comprising an Unit Chief, and technical&#13;
specialists covering some of the main areas of intervention of the project (e.g.,&#13;
information, animal health, phytosanitary services, institutional development, and&#13;
rural infrastructure);&#13;
(c)   Environmental and Social Unit, with an Unit Chief, a Social Assessment&#13;
Specialist, and two technical specialists (environment and social participation);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
(d)   Monitoring Unit, with a Chief and two monitoring specialists;&#13;
(e)   Preinvestment Unit, with an Unit Chief and two technical specialists, and&#13;
(f)    Advisory Group, that would include short term advisors and consultants as&#13;
necessary. The advisors considered essential for supporting project start-up and&#13;
early implementation are: a Senior Procurement Advisor, a Senior Water&#13;
Management Advisor and a Senior Legal Advisor.&#13;
3.3   The establishment of the UEC and the appointment of its key staff, with qualifications and&#13;
on terms acceptable to the Bank, would be conditions for loan effectiveness. These UEC's key&#13;
staff would include: (a) the Executive Coordinator, (b) the Chiefs of the Administrative, the&#13;
Environmental and Social, the Subprojects Management, and the Monitoring Units, and (c) the&#13;
Senior Procurement Advisor and the Senior Legal Advisor (see para. 5.3 (a)).&#13;
3.4    National Subprojects. These subprojects would be coordinated by specialized&#13;
autonomous institutions with adequate capacity and legal competence in the area, and with clearly&#13;
assigned responsibilities at the national level. Normally, it would be either SAGPyA itself or a&#13;
decentralized federal agency under SAGPyA (eventually under other branch of the national&#13;
government). These federal agencies would seek operational agreements with other national or&#13;
regional institutions and provincial agencies (either public or private), for a more effective&#13;
implementation of activities at the local level. In the specific case of the three regional subprojects&#13;
in Group A, the National Service for Food and Agricultural Sanitation and Quality (SENASA),&#13;
would be in charge of the implementation of animal health and plant protection subprojects. The&#13;
specialized institutions under SAGPyA, and SENASA in particular, have substantial experience in&#13;
the implementation of internationally-financed investment projects, including the Bank under the&#13;
ongoing PROMSA operation, and have already demonstrated adequate executing capacity and&#13;
sound financial management.&#13;
3.5   Provincial Subprojects. At the provincial level, a small unit (Fntidad de Programacion&#13;
del Desarrollo Agropecuario, EPDA), would coordinate projects activities for implementation of&#13;
all provincial subprojects in each of the participating provinces. These units would be established&#13;
at the highest level possible within the existing structure of the entity in charge of agriculture at&#13;
the provincial level, and they would work in close contact with the central UEC. In many&#13;
provinces, the existing Provincial Technical Units (Unidades Tecnicas Provinciales, UTP),&#13;
established under the Provincial Development Projects (PDP I and II, Loans 3280-AR and&#13;
3877-AR) in the main provincial financial institution, have experienced and capable staff and&#13;
would be used for channeling funds from the Federal Government to each provincial subproject&#13;
under agreement with the EPDA. Individual subprojects would be implemented directly by a&#13;
provincial executing agency, designed by the provincial government based on its experience and&#13;
competence, and in agreement with the subproject proposal. Project Implementing Units&#13;
(Unidades Ejecutoras de Projecto, UEP), would be established within the relevant specialized&#13;
executing agency for coordination of subproject activities and for liaison with the EPDA and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
UEC. The UEP would seek agreements with other experienced and capable private or public&#13;
organizations (NGOs, farmers' organizations, cooperatives, private service provider, contractors,&#13;
etc.) in order to increase effectiveness in the execution of specific actions. In the provincial&#13;
subprojects included in Group A, all the executing agencies have demonstrated capacity for&#13;
implementation of the activities, and have recently implemented similar projects with external&#13;
financing, even from the Bank (e.g., Mendoza's General Irrigation Department).&#13;
3.6   Institutional Responsibilities and Functions. The CFA would: (i) discuss and agree on&#13;
PROSAP's general policies and procedures; (ii) review and provide recommendations on the&#13;
Operational, Organizational and Environmental Manuals, as well as on the Implementation Plan;&#13;
(iii) provide advice on the Annual Operating Plans; (iv) analyze the pipeline of subprojects, criteria&#13;
for selection and approval of financing; (v) assist SAGPyA and the provinces in improving&#13;
coordination and management, selecting priority areas for institutional strengthening and&#13;
recruitment of staff, and (vi) facilitate inter-institutional coordination between agencies at the&#13;
federal and the provincial levels.&#13;
3.7   SAGPyA, as the federal institution responsible for overall coordination and management,&#13;
would: (i) establish UJEC and hire its staff, (ii) approve the Project Operational Manual (POM);&#13;
(iii) approve subloans for specific subprojects; (iv) approve financial arrangements for each&#13;
subproject and obtain the Bank's "no-objection"; (v) review and approve annual work plans&#13;
(POAs); (vi) approve and sign subsidiary agreements with the Provinces; (vii) review and&#13;
process requests from the UEC Executive Coordinator to use funds from the loan to provide&#13;
technical assistance to the provinces for the preparation of new investment subprojects or for&#13;
institutional strengthening; (viii) transfer responsibility to the UEC to procure goods and services&#13;
in accordance with approved POAs and procurement methods in accordance with the legal&#13;
agreements; (ix) ensure that the Executive Coordinator provides progress reports on request as&#13;
well as any clarification the CFA may need; and (x) organize coordinating meetings with any&#13;
entities involved in project implementation, as warranted.&#13;
3.8   The UJEC, which would report directly to the Undersecretariat for Agriculture, Livestock&#13;
and Forestry (SSAGyF), would ensure coordination of all project activities and supervision of&#13;
individual subprojects, in accordance with the approved subproject documents and the annual&#13;
POAs. The UEC Executive Coordinator would also ensure that subprojects generation, appraisal&#13;
and approval is carried out in accordance to the Operational Manual and the loan agreement.&#13;
Specifically, the UEC would: (i) organize and assist in the preparation of the POAs; (ii) support&#13;
subproject generation and preparation by the Provinces, providing guidance and technical&#13;
assistance and transfer relevant information to the Provinces; (iii) implement the project's&#13;
institutional development component and manage the funds for these activities; (iv) review&#13;
technical and administrative documents produced by the Provincial implementing entities and&#13;
provide guidance accordingly; (v) review, update and improve the Operational Manual and obtain&#13;
the approval from the Bank; (vi) supervise POA implementation in the participating Provinces;&#13;
(vii) supervise Provincial procurement procedures and channel the no-objection requests to the&#13;
donors; (viii) provide information to SAGPyA and to the CFA regarding the subproject proposals&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
presented by the Provinces, based on their technical analysis according to the eligibility criteria;&#13;
(ix) through its Environmental Unit, ensure that proper environmental screening procedures are&#13;
applied in subproject selection, effective corrective actions are taken, and subproject&#13;
environmental impacts are adequately evaluated; (x) establish and maintain an efficient&#13;
monitoring system for the entire project; (xi) present the annual progress reports to the donors&#13;
and participate in the tripartite meetings carried out during supervision; (xii) manage the Project's&#13;
Special Account to receive the deposits from the loan account and reimbursing the expenditures&#13;
incurred by the provinces; (xiii) present to the donors the requests for replenishment of the&#13;
Special Account, with all necessary documentation according to the legal agreements, and the&#13;
requests for direct payments; and (xiv) hire to private independent auditors, acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, to audit all project accounts, in accordance with the legal agreement and Bank's policies on&#13;
the matter.&#13;
3.9   The EPDAs would be part of the highest ministerial or secretariat level entities responsible&#13;
for agricultural sector development and project implementation. The project would provide the&#13;
EPDAs with needed institutional strengthening to carry out their specific project responsibilities,&#13;
as well as their longer-term functions of sectoral planning and programming. In most provinces,&#13;
these project-specific responsibilities would be added to suitable existing units. With respect to&#13;
project implementation, the EPDAs would: (i) prepare and forward the POAs to UEC; (ii) agree&#13;
with SAGPyA on the proposed subprojects Subsidiary Loan Agreements; (iii) manage an account,&#13;
in a provincial commercial bank, to receive the reimbursements from the Special Account;&#13;
(iv) maintain adequate financial records for each of the provincial subprojects; (v) implement POA&#13;
activities for which they retain direct responsibility; (vi) monitor activities contained in the POA;&#13;
(vii) consolidate progress reports at the Provincial level and transmit to the UEC;&#13;
(viii) consolidate accounting reports and submit them to UEC; (ix) directly implement the&#13;
institutional strengthening and agricultural information component at the provincial level; and&#13;
(x) supervise the implementation of subprojects by the UEPs in the province.&#13;
3.10  The UEPs would implement individual subprojects and would be responsible for all&#13;
matters related to subproject operations, including contracting for services, in conformity with&#13;
project guidelines and loan agreements. The UEP would report to the EPDA and submit&#13;
quarterly reports on the progress of subproject implementation.&#13;
3.11   Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the Borrower and each province would include&#13;
clauses by which the province would: (i) assign overall responsibilities for coordination and&#13;
management at the provincial level to a unit acceptable to the Bank; (ii) assign responsibility for&#13;
implementation of each subproject to a competent agency, acceptable to the Bank; (iii) ensure that&#13;
subprojects are carried out in accordance with the Project's Operational Manual (POM),&#13;
Environmental Manual and Implementation Plan; (iv) enforce cost recovery policies and&#13;
procedures as defined in the POM and in the specific subproject documentation; (v) accept all&#13;
terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement signed between the Bank and the Borrower, in&#13;
particular regarding the project's goals and strategy, implementation arrangements, disbursement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
and accounting procedures, and procurement of works, goods and services; and (vi) the provinces&#13;
would follow audit arrangements acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
B. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
3.12 A Monitoring Unit (Unidad de Seguimiento, US) of the UEC, would be in charge of&#13;
carrying out project monitoring, facilitating smoother project implementation by advising the&#13;
Executive Coordinator on the progress and impact of the project. The Monitoring Unit would&#13;
also prepare project progress reports; consolidate information supplied by the project areas and&#13;
provinces; and support the strengthening of provincial institutions.&#13;
3.13  Project monitoring would be based on the project's Annual Operating Plan (Plan&#13;
Operativo Anual, POA), which SAGPyA would present to the Bank annually. The POA would&#13;
cover provincial and subproject progress and objectives. Every six months, the SAGPyA would&#13;
provide the Bank project implementation progress reports, referring to the previously approved&#13;
POA. The SAGPyA report, presented to the Bank within 90 days of the closing of each semester&#13;
(not later than March 31 and September 30 of each year), would contain an update of the POA,&#13;
along with the corresponding budget information. Throughout project implementation, based on&#13;
the SAGPyA reports, the Bank and the SAGPyA would annually evaluate the progress of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.14  The SAGPyA report would be based on the provincial progress reports prepared and&#13;
transmitted to the UEC by the EPDAs every three months. The EPDA report would cover&#13;
inputs, outputs, preliminary impacts and specific characteristics, as well as beneficiaries&#13;
participation and the financial situation of specific subprojects. In addition, every three months&#13;
the EPDA would prepare and transmit to the UEC a project financial report. The financial report&#13;
would cover the financial status of each subproject, including: (i) disbursements according to&#13;
funding source; (ii) disbursements according to cost categories; (iii) comparisons of actual&#13;
disbursements with the approved budget and POA; and (iv) financial projections based on&#13;
committed funds. Finally, each year, the EPDA would prepare and transmit to UEC an annual&#13;
project financial report. The annual report would describe in detail: (i) the use of funds;&#13;
(ii) investment and expenditures; and (iii) anticipated income to recover costs.&#13;
3.15  Annual review of progress between the Bank and SAGPyA would concentrate on the&#13;
project's: (i) outputs and developmental impact for each subproject; (ii) coverage and quality of&#13;
support services provided; (iii) implementation costs, flow of counterpart funds and&#13;
disbursements from the loan; (iv) beneficiary participation; (v) compliance with the&#13;
environmental regulations and impact assessment; (vi) institutional development and training of&#13;
provincial personnel; (vii) compliance with specific cost recovery goals for each subproject;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
(viii) generation and analysis of new subprojects, and technical assistance required; and&#13;
(ix) compliance with loan covenants.&#13;
Mid-Term Review&#13;
3.16  After three years of implementation, and no later than June 30, 2000, a comprehensive&#13;
Mid-Term Review, with scope and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank should be carried&#13;
out by an independent agency external to SAGPyA. This review would concentrate on the&#13;
identification of constraints and possibilities for increasing effectiveness and efficiency in project&#13;
implementation, and would recommend specific mechanisms to improve project performance. As&#13;
a result, the Bank and SAGPyA would agree on a detailed Plan of Action to improve project&#13;
implementation and increase its developmental impact.&#13;
Project Evaluation&#13;
3.17  Project evaluation would also be carried out by an independent agency acceptable to the&#13;
Bank under the agreement with the UEC. This agency could be a public institution or agency, a&#13;
university or a private organization, with experience in the evaluation of internationally-financed&#13;
projects. The agency in charge of evaluation would: (i) extract and document the lessons learned&#13;
from the experience of project implementation; (ii) perform or supervise studies regarding the&#13;
specific problem areas in project execution; (iii) participate in the evaluation of program's and&#13;
projects; and (iv) provide technical assistance to the provinces in project evaluation, including in&#13;
drafting terms of references for evaluation studies and supervising the studies performed.&#13;
Specifically, the agency responsible for the on-going evaluation would: (i) design an evaluation&#13;
system to assess impacts of specific approved subprojects and of the entire project; (ii) assist&#13;
provincial implementing entities, through training activities, to understand and adopt the&#13;
evaluation system, to be able to produce the required information and prepare the type of reports&#13;
needed; and (iii) perform the evaluation activities and produce the reports needed as managing&#13;
tools to help increase the efficiency in project implementation.&#13;
3.18  The presentation of a draft Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was a condition of&#13;
negotiations (see para. 5.1 (a)) and submitting the final design of a detailed Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation (M&amp;E) System acceptable to the Bank would be a condition of loan effectiveness&#13;
(see para. 5.3 (c)).&#13;
C. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS - SUBPROJECTS IN GROUP A&#13;
3.19  The primary development objective of the subprojects financed under PROSAP would be&#13;
to increase beneficiaries' household incomes. Direct gains in farm income would be accomplished&#13;
through improvements in farm productivity, expanded output, diversification to crops with higher&#13;
market values and lower production costs. In addition, some subprojects would increase incomes&#13;
indirectly by generating rural employment opportunities, Table 3.1 below presents the primary&#13;

D. PROJECT OPERATIONAL MANUAL&#13;
3.20  The Project Operational Manual (POM) would cover: (i) project objectives and strategy,&#13;
(ii) implementation institutional arrangements; (iii) description of the relations among the&#13;
SAGPyA, the provincial governments, project implementing agencies and beneficiaries;&#13;
(iv) provincial eligibility; (v) subproject eligibility criteria; (vi) terms and conditions for provincial&#13;
subloans; (vii) disbursement and procurement procedures; (viii) cost recovery arrangements;&#13;
(ix) financial system, Chart of Accounts and auditing requirements; and (x) the Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation System. The Manual's Annexes would contain a description of the subproject cycle&#13;
and the specific selection criteria for subprojects, complete Chart of Accounts, and the bidding&#13;
documents to be used during project implementation.&#13;
3.21  A draft Project Operational Manual (POM) was submitted to the Bank as a condition of&#13;
negotiations (see para. 5.1 (a)), and agreement was reached during negotiations that amendments&#13;
or modifications of the Manual would require Bank approval (see para. 5.2 (a)). As a condition&#13;
of effectiveness, an Operational Manual, acceptable to the Bank, would be finalized and&#13;
implemented by the Borrower (see para. 5.3 (b)).&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.22  Procurement would be undertaken by the UEC, the federal agencies in charge of&#13;
implementing national subprojects (i.e., SENASA for the ones in Group A), and each of the&#13;
implementing agencies (UEPs) in the participating provinces, under the supervision and with the&#13;
assistance of the UEC. All procurement of works and goods would be carried out in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"&#13;
(January 1995, revised January 1996). Consultant, auditing and training services would be&#13;
procured under contracts awarded in accordance with provisions of the "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency"&#13;
(August 1981). International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would use the Bank-issued Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents for the procurement of works and goods. National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) would be based on agreed standard bidding documents for the procurement of works and&#13;
goods. For consulting assignments, the standard forms of contract issued by the Bank would be&#13;
used. Draft documents were presented as a condition of negotiations (see para. 5.1 (c)). Final&#13;
versions of all these documents would be included as annexes to the POM, and approval of the&#13;
POM by the Borrower on terms satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of effectiveness&#13;
(para. 5.3 (b)). In addition, for large or complex works above US$10.0 million, prequalification&#13;
of the bidders would be a requirement.&#13;
3.23   SAGPyA and its related federal agencies in charge of national subprojects (SENASA for&#13;
Group A) have experience in the implementation of internationally-financed investment projects&#13;
with different donors, and have demonstrated adequate capacity for the procurement of civil&#13;
works, goods and services. In addition, SENASA has been carrying out procurement successfully&#13;
under the ongoing PROMSA project cofinanced by the Bank and the IDB. For the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
implementation of the proposed project, it would build on its experience and use the procedures&#13;
already established, expanding and strengthening the existing executing unit and hiring new staff&#13;
to complement its more experienced staff. At the provincial level, all provincial executing&#13;
agencies also have experience in the procurement of works, goods and services financed by&#13;
different international donors. Some of them (e.g., Mendoza's General Irrigation Department)&#13;
have been implementing projects with Bank financing and are familiar with the Bank's procedures.&#13;
The rest of the provincial executing agencies already identified (CORFO-RC, and Santa Fe's&#13;
Ministry of Economy) have been carrying out procurement with financing from other international&#13;
donors, as well as their own resources, and have capable staff that have already started to be&#13;
trained in Bank's procedures. However, with the assistance of the Senior Procurement Advisor in&#13;
the UEC, capacity gaps and additional needs would be identified for strengthening the&#13;
procurement function in all executing agencies. Through the technical assistance funds included&#13;
in the project, support and training would be provided to reduce or eliminate these gaps. The&#13;
Senior Procurement Adviser would be monitoring all procurement procedures and reviewing all&#13;
documentation to be presented to the Bank.&#13;
3.24  Procurement methods to be used for the project activities to be financed by the Bank&#13;
(which have a total cost of US$185 million) are the following. Contracts for civil works expected&#13;
to cost US$5 million or more (to account for approximately US$17.1 million, or 4.8% of total&#13;
project costs) and for goods expected to cost US$350,000 or more (to account for approximately&#13;
US$7.6 million, or 2.1% of total project costs) would be awarded on the basis of ICB procedures.&#13;
Contracts for works expected to cost US$350,000 or more, but less than US$5 million (to&#13;
account for approximately US$22.9 million, or 6.4% of total project costs), and contracts for&#13;
goods expected to cost more than US$100,000, but less than US$350,000 (accounting for&#13;
approximately US$13.0 million, or 3.6% of total project costs), would be awarded on the basis of&#13;
NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. In special cases, where there is a limited number of&#13;
suppliers with established service and maintenance in Argentina, contracts for goods expected to&#13;
cost $100,000 or more, but less than $350,000 (accounting for an estimated total of about&#13;
US$1.5 million, or 0.4% of total project costs), would be awarded on the basis of Limited&#13;
International Bidding (LIB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Procurement for works costing&#13;
less than US$350,000 (approximately US$8.2 million, or 2.3% of total project costs) would be&#13;
procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from&#13;
three qualified domestic contractors in response to written invitations. Contracts for goods&#13;
costing less than US$100,000 (approximately US$14.8 million, or 4. 1% of total project costs)&#13;
would be carried out through international or national shopping involving at least three price&#13;
quotations. Consultant and auditing services, expected to cost approximately US$53 million, or&#13;
14.8% of total project costs, as well as training expenditures, for a total of about US$5.1 million&#13;
or 1.4% of project costs, would be procured in accordance with Bank's procedures for the use of&#13;
consultants.&#13;
3.25  It is expected that civil works, either for rehabilitation, completion, modernization or new&#13;
construction, would be undertaken entirely through contracts with private firms. To the extent&#13;
possible, civil works would be packaged together. However, given the existence of totally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
independent subprojects, financed by separate subloans to different provinces and implemented&#13;
separately also by different executing agencies, it would not be feasible to require ICB for any&#13;
particular type of expenditure. The thresholds for ICB reflect the need to have a substantial&#13;
amount for a contract to be attractive for an international firm in order to decide to participate in&#13;
the bidding process which, in most cases, would be carried out at locations distant from urban&#13;
areas. Types of goods to be procured include: light civil work equipment for maintenance,&#13;
vehicles; computers, office equipment and furniture; communications equipment; training&#13;
equipment; field meteorological stations and instruments; software for Geographical Information&#13;
Systems (GIS); phytosanitary and veterinary laboratory equipment, precision instruments and&#13;
supplies, as well as equipment and supplies for supporting eradication campaigns and the&#13;
corresponding field monitoring systems; equipment and instruments for measuring and monitoring&#13;
water flows and assessing water quality; and gasoline and lubricants. In the case of vehicles,&#13;
computers and civil work equipment, ICB, LIB or NCB would be required in all cases. For the&#13;
most of the products to be procured, there exists already a widely diversified supply in Argentina,&#13;
at prices competitive with the international market. However, highly specialized goods with a&#13;
limited number of suppliers with established maintenance and service in Argentina, for contracts&#13;
expected to cost more than US$100,000 but below US$350,000, would be procured following&#13;
LIB procedures. This would apply to: (i) high precision laboratory equipment for phytosanitary&#13;
and veterinary analysis, quality controls, and determination of agrochemical and toxic residues,&#13;
(ii) field equipment for supporting pest management, monitoring of diseases, and eradication&#13;
campaigns; (iii) software for GIS systems; and (iv) meteorological equipment and instruments.&#13;
To ensure that the agreed procurement procedures are properly carried out, the Bank would&#13;
review ex-ante all procurement procedures, documents, bid evaluations and contract awards for&#13;
ICB, LIB and NCB procurement of goods and works during the entire project implementation&#13;
period. Presentation of draft Terms of Reference (TOR) for all major consulting services to be&#13;
required during the first year of project implementation for the provincial subprojects in Group A&#13;
(at both the provincial and federal levels), was a condition of negotiations (see para. 5. 1 (d)).&#13;
3.26  These procurement review procedures explained above for works, goods and consulting&#13;
services are summarized in Table 3.3. Following the procedures defined in this table, the Bank&#13;
would review ex-ante contracts for about US$112.3 million, representing about 62% of the total&#13;
cost of the subprojects and components in which the Bank would participate (total cost of these&#13;
activities would be US$185 million). These contracts subject to Bank prior review would require&#13;
about US$94 million of financing from the loan, which represents a coverage of around 75% of&#13;
the total loan amount. Considering only the civil works, goods, and consulting and training&#13;
categories, the Bank would be reviewing ex-anle about 78 5% of the total cost of these&#13;
expenditures (which have a total cost of US$143.1 million)&#13;

no expenditures for such items would be financed from the loan, the Bank would cancel the&#13;
corresponding loan amount, and the Special Account would be reimbursed accordingly by the&#13;
Borrower. This should not only streamnline project execution but also reduce the Bank's&#13;
supervision burden. However, if a province or implementing agency fails to comply with the&#13;
agreed procedures, the Bank could require a full ex-ante review for all procedures and categories.&#13;

3.28   The loan would include three categories: (a) Category 1-Implementation of&#13;
Subprojects; (b) Category 2-Institutional Strengthening and Project Coordination and&#13;
Management; and (c) Category 3-Unallocated. Category I would include the following&#13;
subcategories and disbursement percentages for withdrawing the proceeds of the proposed Bank&#13;
loan: (i) Civil Works, 80% of total expenditures; (ii) Goods, 100% for foreign expenditures (net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
of taxes) and 80% for local expenditures; (iii) Consultant, Auditing and Training Services,&#13;
100% of total expenditures (net of taxes); and (iv) Incremental Recurrent Costs, a decreasing&#13;
percentage of eligible expenditures corresponding to an average of about 3 5% over the&#13;
implementation period. Category 2 would include only two subcategories, with the same&#13;
percentages as defined in the first category: (i) Consulting, Auditing and Training Services;&#13;
and (ii) Incremental Recurrent Costs. Allocation of loan proceeds per subcategory and the&#13;
corresponding disbursement percentages are presented in Table 3.4.&#13;
3.29   The proceeds of the proposed loan are expected to be disbursed over a period of seven&#13;
years. The disbursement period, similar to the seven-year standard profile for Argentina, was&#13;
determined after taking into account: (i) the advanced status of the Group A subproject&#13;
preparation; (ii) the decentralized nature of project, which would permit several provinces to draw&#13;
upon loan resources simultaneously; and (iii) the strong national and provincial government&#13;
commitment towards the project. Therefore, the expected completion date would be December&#13;
31, 2003, and the Closing Date would be June 30, 2004.&#13;

3.30 A Special Account in US dollars, and with an authorized allocation of US$8 million,&#13;
would be established in a commercial bank selected by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
An initial deposit of up to US$4.0 million would be made and the full amount of the authorized&#13;
allocation would be released when disbursements reach a level of US$10 million. The Special&#13;
Account would be managed by the UEC. Sub-accounts, within the same selected commercial&#13;
bank, would be envisaged for each one of the participating provinces with effective subloans, in&#13;
order to expedite disbursements to these provinces. All disbursements against contracts for less&#13;
than US$350,000 for works, for less than US$100,000 for goods, and for services less than&#13;
US$100,000 for consultant, auditing and training firms, and for less than US$30,000 for&#13;
individual consultants, would be made on the basis of certified Statements of Expenditure (SOEs).&#13;
The documentation for SOEs would not be sent to the Bank but would be retained by the UEC&#13;
and made available for inspection by Bank staff. All other disbursements would be made against&#13;
standard documentation.&#13;
3.31  Retroactive financing for expenditures incurred after February 12, 1996 (but not earlier&#13;
than 12 months before loan signing) in an amount not to exceed US$6.0 million (4.8% of the&#13;
Loan amount) is recomnmended.&#13;
3.32  The project would have specific disbursement conditions to be met by the participating&#13;
provinces for each one of the provincial subprojects, before being considered eligible for obtaining&#13;
reimbursement of expenditures (see para. 5.4). As a province and a subproject meets the&#13;
conditions, the Bank would add them to the list of provinces and subprojects eligible for&#13;
financing. During implementation, if a province ceases to meet the conditions, the Bank would&#13;
instruct its Disbursement Department to suspend honoring withdrawal requests with respect to&#13;
that province. The following would be the conditions of disbursement to be met by each province&#13;
for each one of the provincial subprojects:&#13;
(a)   establishment, adequate staffing and funding of the EPDA and UEP, according to&#13;
the subproject proposal and signature of operational agreements between them, all&#13;
acceptable to the Bank;&#13;
(b)   execution of a satisfactory Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the Federal&#13;
Government;&#13;
(c)   evidence that the province had taken all actions necessary for the exemption of all&#13;
contracts for goods, works and services to be financed under the loan from all&#13;
legal and regulatory provisions limiting the international procurements of goods,&#13;
works and services;&#13;
(d)   approval of the subproject feasibility study by the Borrower and the Bank, as&#13;
provided in the POM;&#13;
(e)   satisfactory legal opinion on the validity of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
(f)   provide evidence acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank regarding provincial&#13;
availability of counterparts funds for the first year of implementation.&#13;
G. AccouNTs AND AuDITs&#13;
3.33  Each executing agency would maintain separate project accounts in accordance with&#13;
sound and accepted accounting practices, acceptable to the Bank. A draft Chart of Accounts&#13;
was submitted to the Bank as a condition of negotiations (para. 5. 1(b)) and final versions of the&#13;
Chart of Accounts and of the accounting system should be implemented by the Borrower as a&#13;
condition of effectiveness (para. 5.3 (b)). An audit of the financial status of the program would&#13;
take place once a year for the national components and for each subproject, either regional or&#13;
provincial. The audit would be carried out by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
hired under procedures based on Bank Guidelines. The audit reports would be sent to the Bank&#13;
not more than six months after the end of the calendar year. The report would include, inter alia,&#13;
specific opinions on: (i) sources of proceeds and their use; (ii) SOEs; (iii) implementation of&#13;
contracting clauses, including the application of eligibility criteria, and compliance with&#13;
procurement procedures and other financing conditions included in the POM; and (iv)&#13;
management of the Special Account.&#13;

4. PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS&#13;
A. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
4.1    The Bank's strategy for provincial reform emphasizes fiscal balance through public sector&#13;
administrative reforms and more efficient resource allocation. Through the proposed project,&#13;
provinces would redesign their agricultural support services to increase their efficiency,&#13;
beneficiary and geographic coverage, and private sector participation. By strengthening&#13;
beneficiary management of infrastructure and services, and transferring the delivery of support&#13;
services from the public to the private sector, the project would not only reduce provincial fiscal&#13;
burdens, but would also improve service quality. The project would increase operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) administered and funded through water user charges and private sector&#13;
collaboration in agricultural research, technology generation and transfer&#13;
4.2   Through the project, provinces would take advantage of new domestic and export market&#13;
opportunities, modernize agricultural technology and improve product quality. As a result, the&#13;
project would reduce unemployment in the rural and farm-related sectors by contributing to&#13;
economic stability and growth. Finally, the project would encourage a sustainable and&#13;
complementary relationship between the public and the private sectors in the provision of&#13;
agricultural support services.&#13;
4.3   The proposed project would result in: (a) increased and diversified production with higher&#13;
proportion of high-value products (in some cases, derived from upgrading and accrediting&#13;
production to internationally recognized sanitary and quality standards), thus increasing the&#13;
competitiveness and value of exports (total value of production would increase about 45% over&#13;
baseline levels); (b) increased net incomes (between 25 and 50% in real terms for different types&#13;
of farmers) and improved standard of living of about 120,000 direct rural beneficiaries;&#13;
(c) improved provincial fiscal situation derived from reducing current expenditures through the&#13;
transfer of financial responsibilities to the private sector and increased tax revenues from a more&#13;
dynamic sector; (d) improved provincial capacity to take policy decisions and to plan, select,&#13;
implement and monitor investment alternatives; (e) strengthened and more integrated private&#13;
sector, sharing implementation responsibilities and, therefore, increasing the long-term&#13;
sustainability of proposed actions; and (f) mitigation of existing environmental problems (e.g. soil&#13;
erosion, salinization and desertification, seasonal floods, inadequate drainage, and inappropriate&#13;
water management) and improved capacity to monitor environmental effects.&#13;
4.4    As the poor in Argentina are increasingly rural, the project's poverty alleviation spill-over&#13;
effect could be significant. While not exclusively targeted to the poor, the project would benefit&#13;
many poor farmers, particularly in the northern regions, which has Argentina's highest incidence&#13;
of poverty. These farmers would benefit from improved productivity and higher returns to their&#13;
harvests due to diversification to higher-value crops and greater market access. The project&#13;
would also provide substantial employment opportunities in the rural areas, where the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
unemployment rates of 21% surpassed the national average rate of 18.6% in 1995. The project's&#13;
many infrastructure rehabilitation works would rapidly provide short-term employment. More&#13;
importantly, the project would increase longer-term employment opportunities by stimulating&#13;
provincial economies, introducing more labor-intensive technologies. expanding cultivated area&#13;
and promoting rural enterprises.&#13;
4.5   Estimates of internal economic rates of return (IERR) for the investment subprojects in&#13;
Group A are presented in Annex E and summarized in Table 4.1. Estimated IERRs for each of&#13;
these subprojects range between 15.0% and 40.1%. Considering aggregate benefits and total&#13;
costs for the Group A subprojects and adding the full costs for institutional strengthening, project&#13;
coordination and management (both at the federal and provincial levels) for the project as a&#13;
whole, gives an estimated overall IERR of about 22.2%. This represents the IERR for a total&#13;
investment of about US$214.2 million, or 60% of the total project costs of about US$357.2&#13;
million. These results are presented in the following Table 4. 1. Therefore, considering that&#13;
several of the subprojects and components included in the economic analysis do not have&#13;
estimated benefits and assuming Group A is representative of subprojects to be financed, this&#13;
IERR could be considered as a very conservative estimate of the final overall project economic&#13;
rate of return including all benefits and costs for all subprojects and components.&#13;

Calculated on the basis of the aggregate flow of the expected costs and benefits for all these subprojects. No benefits were assigned to the project&#13;
implementation support components or to the National Agricultural Information System.&#13;
B. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.6      Increasing opportunities for the private sector to deliver agricultural support services, a&#13;
primary project objective, would contribute to the sustainability of the project's benefits. With&#13;
respect to irrigation systems, the project, by increasing the participation of private water service&#13;
companies or water user groups in system operation and maintenance (and eventually transferring&#13;
completely the responsibility to these users' associations), would help to ensure that project&#13;
infrastructure investments are adequately maintained. In the animal health and phytosanitary&#13;
subprojects, the private sector has an important role from the start, implementing key activities at&#13;
their local level, participating in the decisions and contributing substantially in terms of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
counterpart financing. In addition, by improving the sector's competitive position, the project is&#13;
expected to attract sufficient capital flows to complement project initiatives, providing sustained&#13;
growth in agriculture, agro-industry and agriculturally-related service industries.&#13;
4.7   In particular, the project would encourage private sector participation in the provision of&#13;
basic agricultural services. Each investment subproject would be supported by basic applied&#13;
research and extension components. These services would be contracted out by the implementing&#13;
agencies through competitive processes open to private and public entities with experience and&#13;
capabilities. The direct beneficiaries of these subprojects (farmers) would have intensive&#13;
participation in the determination of priorities, eligibility criteria for selection, contract awards, as&#13;
well as the evaluation of results. All project-funded contracts for delivery of services, training and&#13;
technical assistance services would be competitively awarded to private and public entities. As&#13;
this approach is new for Argentina, appropriate expertise would be provided from countries with&#13;
similar experiences, such as Chile and Brazil.&#13;
C. SOCIAL ASSESSMENT AND BENEFICIARY PARTICIPATION&#13;
4.8    A systematic stakeholder consultation and an organizational diagnosis were implemented&#13;
during preparation to analyze and discuss specific mechanisms to ensure beneficiary involvement&#13;
and participation and to strengthen water user associations. Cases from five provinces (Buenos&#13;
Aires, Mendoza, Neuquen, Rio Negro and Salta) with different agroecological and socioeconomic&#13;
conditions were selected for the studies. The objectives of both studies were to establish a&#13;
feedback between the project team and the beneficiaries and to develop an appropriate framework&#13;
for their participation&#13;
Findings&#13;
4.9    One of the initial conclusions was that, in general, small-producer organizations tend to be&#13;
weak and producers do not perceive clear benefits from participating. That is the case of most&#13;
water user associations (WUA), particularly in provinces where water management system are&#13;
centralized, and WUA are not perceived as autonomous organizations. Nevertheless, it is&#13;
important to indicate that in most cases where services have been decentralized, the system&#13;
operates more efficiently and users are satisfied with the services provided.&#13;
4.10   Very frequently, farmers perceive that key policy and management decisions that directly&#13;
affect them are taken without consulting them, and that there is a lack of clear mechanisms for&#13;
their participation in the decision making process. Regarding PROSAP, producers felt that, until&#13;
the consultation, they had insufficient information about the project and little participation during&#13;
the initial formulation. The consultation showed that while representatives from government&#13;
agencies and WUA have similar assessments of the limitations and potential for increasing&#13;
beneficiary participation and decentralizing the irrigation systems, they have different priorities&#13;
regarding the proposed solutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
4.11   The key problems identified by the WUA and state officials, can be grouped into three&#13;
main categories: (i) Social; (ii) Technical; and (iii) Economic-financial. Among the social&#13;
problems, the most important are the weakness and lack of managerial skills of the WUA, the&#13;
heterogeneity of producers, and the lack of effective participation. Among the technical&#13;
problems, inappropriate infrastructure, existing technical inefficiencies and lack of technical skills&#13;
are the ones most commonly highlighted. The major economic-financial limitations mentioned are&#13;
the repayment capacity of the producers, the amount of the proposed investments, and the lack of&#13;
resources required to carry out the decentralization of services to the producers (see Annex G).&#13;
4.12   The key issues that beneficiaries and government officials consider essential for successful&#13;
project implementation are: (i) improving beneficiary participation; and (ii) strengthening producer&#13;
associations, particularly developing the organizational, technical and managerial skills of the&#13;
WUA. The crucial challenges that emerges from the consultation is to develop confidence,&#13;
credibility and commitment on the producers. Increasing consultation and participation during&#13;
implementation is perceived by the stakeholders as the only possibility to influence and have&#13;
increasing control over project activities.&#13;
4.13   The desire for participation and the dynamism of the producers are some of the positive&#13;
factors that would facilitate the transition toward decentralized management systems. Increasing&#13;
responsibility and participation in the management of the irrigation systems is generally perceived&#13;
by farmers as a priority for improving overall efficiency in the operation of the systems and&#13;
increasing competitiveness. Producers are aware of the risks and costs that the decentralization&#13;
would imply, and they are willing to take those risks and to pay for a better service.&#13;
4.14   The institutional flexibility of the WUA is another asset that would help to respond swiftly&#13;
to operational, technical and administrative problems. Producer associations are closer to the&#13;
users than provincial government agencies. Producers identify themselves with their associations,&#13;
and are willing to grant them with the power to enforce and sanction administrative rules. The&#13;
normative flexibility of the associations also facilitates the development of irrigation management&#13;
systems appropriated to the productive activities of the users.&#13;
Implementing Participation&#13;
4.15  In order to ensure proper analysis of social issues and to promote permanent beneficiary&#13;
participation during project implementation, specific actions and procedures agreed with key&#13;
stakeholders and the government have been included in the project design (with corresponding&#13;
costs) and the procedures described in the Operational Manual. These actions are summarized in&#13;
the following paragraphs and presented in detail in Annex G.&#13;
4.16 Screening and Appraisal of Subproject Proposals. During the screening of new&#13;
subproject proposals, key socio-economic and organizational factors would be considered to&#13;
assess the potential social impacts and viability of the proposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
4.17 Fostering Beneficiary Participation. Four elements have been proposed to strengthen&#13;
beneficiary participation:&#13;
(a)   Dissemination  One of the problems highlighted by the consultation was the&#13;
deficient and disparate level of information among the producers, their leaders,&#13;
provincial authorities and the project staff. To address this issue, the UEPs would&#13;
have consultants (specialists in participation and social assessment), that would be&#13;
responsible for the design and implementation of the dissemination activities. The&#13;
activities proposed would include a short term dissemination campaign organized&#13;
at the provincial level to make existing project information available to key&#13;
provincial stakeholders (NGOs, Universities, other government agencies); and a&#13;
permanent communication system consisting of bulletins and dissemination notes,&#13;
and periodic meetings with producer associations and other key provincial&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
(b)   Institutional Mechanisms for Participation. As a result of the consultation and&#13;
organizational diagnosis, specific institutional mechanisms were proposed for&#13;
developing and strengthening beneficiary participation in project implementation.&#13;
The proposed institutional mechanisms involve two levels that would allow&#13;
beneficiary participation and would feed the information required for decision&#13;
making.&#13;
(i)    Local Fora. These fora, created at the local level, would be comprised of&#13;
representatives of producer associations, NGOs, and other relevant&#13;
stakeholders. They would have an advisory role to the UEPs, and would&#13;
constitute a mechanism for permanent feedback between the UEPs and the&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
(ii)   Provincial Consultative Councils. At the provincial level, the UEPs&#13;
would stimulate the development of Consultative Councils (CC) with&#13;
representatives of the LF. The CC would advise the EPDA on&#13;
participation, social and environmental issues. The CC would establish a&#13;
link between the local level (LF) and the provincial level (EPDAs) that&#13;
would allow beneficiaries to have a voice in the discussion of actions&#13;
affecting project implementation, as well as on policy issues and long-term&#13;
programming.&#13;
(c)    Training. The objectives of the training activities proposed are to provide&#13;
technical assistance and training in managerial and organizational development to&#13;
project staff and producers and to stimulate the former to participate in their&#13;
organizations. Proposed activities would be implemented at the regional and&#13;
national levels. Training at the regional level would be targeted to producers and&#13;
administrative staff of the producer associations. Training at the national level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
would focus on project staff and other agencies or institutions involved in&#13;
extension and technical assistance. The training activities would be developed&#13;
during the first three years of the project. The provincial and national seminars&#13;
would be organized by the UEPs and the UEC respectively.&#13;
(d)   Institutional Strengthening. To ensure the successful implementation of the&#13;
above-described activities, the UEC and UEPs would be strengthened with the&#13;
required staff. At the central level, the UEC would be required to include two&#13;
professionals: (i) a Social Assessment Coordinator; and (ii) a Participation,&#13;
Dissemination and Training Specialist. Also, all UEPs would include a consultant&#13;
on social assessment and participation.&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
4.18  Environmental analyses were conducted on the Group A subprojects to evaluate their&#13;
potential environmental impacts, and the recommended mitigative actions, along with their&#13;
associated costs, were incorporated into the design of Group A subprojects. The studies&#13;
concluded that the subprojects would have significant positive environmental impacts, including:&#13;
(i) reduced salinization; (ii) decreased soil erosion; (iii) increased crop diversification; (iv) better&#13;
animal husbandry practices; (iv) natural resource conservation; (v) reduced application of&#13;
agro-chemicals; and (iv) more sanitary consumer health conditions. But in a few cases the studies&#13;
concluded that, without appropriate mitigative measures, some subprojects could, in limited areas,&#13;
increase soil exhaustion or erosion. To eliminate these risks, the studies recommended&#13;
complementary technology transfer and extension programs. In particular, training for irrigation&#13;
users would promote rational and efficient water use, management and administration. Specific&#13;
mitigative measures have been included in each of the subprojects following the recommendations&#13;
of the analyses. These are presented in Annex F. In addition, the environmental studies&#13;
recommended that an environmental monitoring component be included in subprojects with&#13;
possible environmental impacts. An Executive Summary of the Project's Environmental&#13;
Assessment was distributed to the Board on December 21, 1995. As part of the subprojects'&#13;
monitoring and evaluation component, baseline data would be established to verify the project's&#13;
impact on the environment, economy and beneficiaries.&#13;
4.19  In the case of the Pozo Borrado subproject, in addition to the environmental analysis&#13;
mentioned above, the need to carry out a complementary study on the potential environmental&#13;
impacts of the subproject on the flora and fauna of the regional wetlands has been identified.&#13;
Also, a consultation with indigenous communities in the surrounding area is required to ensure&#13;
that indigenous communities are informed of proposed project activities, and that their concerns&#13;
are incorporated in the final project design. Completion of the complementary study and the&#13;
consultation process, as well as the incorporation of any new mitigative measures required, would&#13;
be conditions for the Bank's approval of the subsidiary loan agreement and, therefore, for the&#13;
disbursement of funds under this subloan (see para. 5.5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
4.20  The project would provide extensive support to project institutions, at the national,&#13;
provincial and subproject levels, to strengthen their capacities to evaluate, monitor and mitigate&#13;
subprojects' environmental impacts. The Environmental Unit (UnidadAmbiental, UA), within&#13;
the UEC, would be responsible for screening subproject proposals for their potential&#13;
environmental impact and would supervise the environmental specialists within the provincial&#13;
units. The UA would be responsible for ensuring that the environmental screening procedures,&#13;
impact assessments and corrective measures, as outlined in the Projects Environmental Manual&#13;
(Manual Ambiental, MA) would be properly carried out at every relevant project phase and at all&#13;
levels of project administration. In addition, the UA would provide technical assistance and&#13;
training at the provincial level, to strengthen local institutional capacity to design and implement&#13;
environmentally sound subprojects. Presentation of a draft Environmental Manual was a&#13;
condition for loan negotiations (see para. 5.1 (a)). Appointment of the Head of the&#13;
Environmental and Social Unit (on terms acceptable to the Bank) and the adoption by the&#13;
Borrower of the Environmental Manual, would be conditions of loan effectiveness (see para.&#13;
5.3 (b)).&#13;
4.21   Environmental screening procedures have been established which would be applied to all&#13;
new subproject proposals. This procedure begins with the preparation of an Environmental&#13;
Profile which would include a subproject summary, review of relevant environmental legislation,&#13;
identification of potential impacts, a preliminary subproject classification (according to the Bank's&#13;
classification system) and identification of required studies. Because of the nature of the project,&#13;
individual subprojects are expected to fall under either environmental classification B, which&#13;
requires an Environmental Analysis (EA), or C, which does not require any specific study. The&#13;
eligibility criteria would exclude any subproject proposal based on the expansion of the&#13;
agricultural frontier at the expense of natural forests or promoting the conversion of wild lands to&#13;
agriculture, thus affecting natural habitats. The increase in area under cultivation would be&#13;
produced by intensification of the use of agricultural land, which is land classified as capable of&#13;
being used intensively for agriculture and that has been cultivated before. The project would help&#13;
remove some of the constraints (scarce water for irrigation, poor drainage and salinization in&#13;
sections of the potentially irrigated area, low productivity due to diseases and poor cultural&#13;
practices, varieties not adapted to market requirements, etc.) that are presently limiting the area&#13;
actually being used for agricultural productive purposes in the same period. In order to facilitate&#13;
the EA and subproject screening, the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessments and&#13;
Environmental Analysis would be a chapter in the Project Environmental Manual, incorporating&#13;
the national and provincial environmental stipulations regarding impact assessments, and&#13;
consistent with the Bank policies and procedures. The Environmental Manual would have to be&#13;
approved by the Bank, and would not be amended without Bank's consent. As part of the&#13;
documentation to be submitted to obtain the Bank's approval for financing a specific investment&#13;
subproject, the Borrower should submit all environmental studies, analyses and assessments&#13;
carried out for the subproject, as well as a description of all mitigative actions resulting from these&#13;
studies and introduced in the subproject design. These procedures are explained in detail in&#13;
Annex F.&#13;

E. RISKS, EXOGENOUS CONDITIONS AND MITIGATING MEASURES&#13;
4.22  Project success would be influenced by the following five exogenous conditions:&#13;
(a)   Provincial Institutional Capacity. Lack of experience and limited technical&#13;
capabilities in some provinces would be addressed by the project's institutional&#13;
strengthening component. In some cases, for the less advanced provinces, the&#13;
project would adopt a region, or multi-provincial approach under the responsibility&#13;
of a federal agency. The regional approach would provide those provinces needed&#13;
additional administrative and technical support for subproject implementation.&#13;
(b)   Provincial Financial Capacity. The application of provincial eligibility criteria&#13;
would ensure sub-borrowers' creditworthiness. Because certain provinces face&#13;
fiscal constraints, the project would finance 70% of total investment, with debt&#13;
partially assumed by the Central Government and partially financed by&#13;
beneficiaries' service fees. In addition, since the repayment terms would be an&#13;
average of the terms of the IDB and the Bank, the repayment period would be long&#13;
relative to other Bank loans. Strong beneficiary participation and private sector&#13;
involvement is expected to reduce the provincial fiscal burden and contribute to&#13;
loan repayment.&#13;
(c)   Sustained Commitment to the Project. While political commitment for the&#13;
project is very strong, possible political changes could shift provincial short-term&#13;
priorities The project would have enough flexibility to be able to adapt to these&#13;
changes and shift resources in accordance with commitment and priorities. More&#13;
importantly, the project, through careful client selection and the generation of&#13;
strong beneficiary participation, would build a consensus sound enough to&#13;
withstand changes in short-term political priorities.&#13;
(d)   Complementary Investment Flows. To fully realize project benefits, project&#13;
investments should be complemented by additional investments. Insufficient&#13;
long-term credit and limited access by the agricultural sector are factors that may&#13;
affect on-farm investments and full achievement of project goals. The project, by&#13;
improving and rehabilitating rural infrastructure, increasing productivity and&#13;
promoting private sector collaboration in agricultural service delivery, would&#13;
attract capital flows to the sector. The stronger Argentine economic position and&#13;
renewed confidence for growth, along with the increased sectoral competitive&#13;
position, are expected to ensure adequate investment flows. However, the Bank&#13;
has been supporting efforts to identify limitations and constraints to access to&#13;
long-term credit. A recently finished study '9 tries to draw conclusions on the&#13;
9 The Frameworkfor Secured Transactions and Access to Credit in Agriculture. Report No. 15456-AR (Green&#13;
Cover), The World Bank, April 29, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
restrictions to use property in general (other than land) as a collateral, as well as&#13;
the issues regarding the framework for security interests. In addition, the Bank is&#13;
carrying out, as part of economic and sector work, a study to analyze in depth how&#13;
financial markets work in the rural areas, identify inefficiencies and propose&#13;
mechanisms to increase access to investment credit. Finally, there are technical&#13;
assistance funds allocated in the project to finance complementary studies during&#13;
project implementation to learn more about specific constraints affecting project&#13;
beneficiaries and propose actions to be supported by the project to increase access&#13;
to long-term financing.&#13;
(e)   Liberal Trade Environment. Effects of the MERCOSUR and greater economic&#13;
integration on the agricultural sector are uncertain. Argentina has entered into a&#13;
full customs union with Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, including reciprocal zero&#13;
tariffs for most goods and a common external tariff averaging 14% (varying from 0&#13;
to 20%) for most goods (except for a few commodities that have a later deadline,&#13;
such as sugar in 2001). Though the on-going stabilization program in Brazil and&#13;
the overall prospects of economic integration are beneficial for the Argentine farm&#13;
sector, specific provinces and products could suffer in the short and medium terms.&#13;
However, the project would have an important impact on the international&#13;
competitiveness of the agricultural production -through reductions of costs,&#13;
increases in productivity and improvements in quality and sanitary conditions-&#13;
which would contribute to mitigate these adjustments. By increasing the sharing&#13;
of information and experiences between provinces, the project would contribute to&#13;
help some provinces capitalize lessons learned by the rest, and reduce risks.&#13;

ARGENTINA&#13;
PROVINCIAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. BANKwIDE LENDING FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.    The Bank's long experience with agricultural and rural development projects has produced&#13;
an extensive catalogue of lessons. OED evaluations of the Bank-wide cohort of agricultural&#13;
projects show a combination of internal and external factors adversely affecting their performance&#13;
and results over several decades.' Deficient preparation and appraisal, including lack of a strong&#13;
sectoral rationale or linkage, in part due to the lack of adequate sector work, affected project&#13;
quality at entry, i.e., the "project factors" synthesized in the Portfolio Management Task Force&#13;
Report. Socio-cultural and technical characteristics particular to the sector required an optimal&#13;
information base for project design. Area development projects, especially integrated rural&#13;
development, had a particularly poor record; many were over-complex, top-down operations&#13;
which required exceptional leadership and commitment, and presented difficulties for supervision&#13;
and sustainability.&#13;
2.    Country factors have played a critical role in project outcomes, where unfavorable&#13;
borrower incentives ran counter to the production and income objectives of many projects. In&#13;
LAC especially, inadequate macroeconomic and sectoral policies which discriminated against&#13;
agriculture for decades, were probably the main reason for the poor performance of many&#13;
agricultural projects. The latter part of the 1980s, however, witnessed dramatic political change&#13;
in the Region as many countries, including Argentina, democratized, adopting programs of&#13;
macroeconomic reform, markedly different economic and sectoral policies, and decentralizing&#13;
public services to the provincial and municipal levels. In Argentina, the move towards a more&#13;
efficient, equitable and fiscally responsible federalism remains a key element in the country's&#13;
macroeconomic strategy. Argentina's public services, including agricultural support services, have&#13;
been decentralized to the provincial and local levels, with the devolution of operation and&#13;
maintenance to the private sector where feasible and appropriate.&#13;
3.    A new generation of agricultural projects reflects the influence of direct experience and&#13;
policy changes in the transition to projects whose content and execution are more flexible,&#13;
expanding and/or deepening successful aspects of preceding operations. The private sector,&#13;
NGOs and beneficiaries are collaborating increasingly in the design, execution and management of&#13;
demand-driven investment programs. Decentralized implementation stresses the building up of&#13;
local capacity, user organizations, cost-sharing and cost recovery. Sustainability is a key&#13;
objective, with various modalities being used to secure recurrent funding and ensure operation&#13;
and maintenance (O&amp;M). The proposed project, consistent with these themes of new lending, is&#13;

the first step in Argentina towards the decentralization of agricultural services to the provinces&#13;
and the promotion of further collaboration with the private sector.&#13;
4.    Lessons of Irrigation Lending. Water resources have been a major focus of Bank&#13;
financing worldwide since 1950, and the portfolio has witnessed significant change in recent&#13;
years. While OED concludes that the breadth and equitable distribution of this lending represents&#13;
a strong case for its continuation, projects have been affected by design, construction,&#13;
management, operational and social factors stemming from fragmented public investment&#13;
programs and sector management, excessive reliance on overextended public agencies, and public&#13;
investments and regulations that have neglected quality, health and environmental concerns.&#13;
Some three-quarters of the national irrigated area of Argentina is affected by impeded drainage&#13;
and salinization, with systems operating at very low efficiency due to minimal investment over&#13;
many decades. This has become a direct constraint on agricultural growth, and demands a new&#13;
set of actions reflecting best practices.&#13;
5.    The Bank's Water Resource Management Policy (WRMIP) paper proposes a new&#13;
approach to irrigation lending, the essence of which is the adoption of a comprehensive policy&#13;
framework, the view of water as an economic good, decentralized water management and&#13;
delivery models, greater reliance on pricing, and the full participation of water users. The&#13;
objective is to modernize irrigation practices, direct greater attention to cost recovery, integrate&#13;
drainage and salinity control, improve operation and maintenance of existing systems, and&#13;
investments in small-scale irrigation and water-harvesting methods. The lessons emphasize&#13;
institutional strengthening to improve coordination and analysis, stated to be especially important&#13;
in countries such as Argentina, whose federalist structure gives primary authority over water to&#13;
provincial or state governments.2 Also stressed are technological research and lower-cost&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
6.    Decentralization and Participation. There is broad consensus that decentralization and&#13;
regionalization of planning and implementation are important strategies to test in Bank projects,&#13;
but that agencies should not be pushed too far, too fast; priorities and policies should probably&#13;
remain more centralized even if implementation is decentralized, given that these are national&#13;
issues, not internalized at the local level. In the case of irrigation systems, the WRM1P advocates&#13;
full Bank support to governments for decentralizing responsibility, and transferring irrigation&#13;
service delivery to the private sector, basically by relying on water user associations. Numerous&#13;
studies show that when the knowledge and experience of farmers are factored into the planning,&#13;
development and operation of irrigation systems, overall performance and sustainability improves.&#13;
Satisfactory organization leads to satisfactory operation and maintenance, which in turn generates&#13;
good cost recovery.&#13;
7.    Water user associations have proven effective in the Province of Mendoza in which, when&#13;
traditional associations covering relatively small areas were unable to meet associated costs,&#13;
efficiency and maintenance suffered. Their amalgamation into larger associations enabled them to&#13;
generate their own budgets, regulate their activities, and hire professional managers to handle cost&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-                              Annex A&#13;
recovery, water delivery, and maintenance. Lower costs resulted from fewer, larger associations,&#13;
and water distribution improved markedly. The process of transferring state-owned and -&#13;
managed systems to user groups, however, is not easy; many schemes require rehabilitation before&#13;
users will take them over, an important principle underlying the proposed project. Further,&#13;
governnent must be willing to devolve systems to users, and the capacity of users to self-manage&#13;
systems must be upgraded where necessary, through the kinds of technical assistance&#13;
arrangements proposed in this project.3&#13;
8.    The Bank and Borrower should foster the conditions associated with durable water user&#13;
group formation, in lieu of covenants requiring their organization. Evidence strongly suggests&#13;
that these conditions for successful user aggregation include: (i) the recognition by users that the&#13;
benefits also entail costs; (ii) service to well-defined areas, and with members having specific&#13;
functions and responsibilities; (iii) member contributions proportional to benefits;&#13;
(iv) participatory processes for establishing water allocation rules and a system of penalties for&#13;
violators; (v) low-cost settlement of local disputes; (vi) cohesive organizations incorporating a&#13;
mix of small and larger organizations; and, (vii) a non-challenging stance from government&#13;
towards user organizations.4&#13;
9.    Overall, the emphasis should be to service on upgrading existing irrigation systems to&#13;
standards appropriate for changing agricultural, economic and social conditions. Such an&#13;
approach involves multiple disciplines, and is consistent with the WRMP. Better project design&#13;
should heed several key factors: (i) environmental problems caused by poor drainage means&#13;
projects should continue to stress drainage financing; (ii) irrigation investment success is&#13;
generally related to low unit costs and a sound macroeconomic situation; and (iii) sustainability is&#13;
fostered through direct financing by users and the existence of stable, moderately-sized user&#13;
groups.&#13;
10.   Cost Recovery. It is widely accepted that cost recovery and water pricing should&#13;
accurately and fully reflect the true value of operation and maintenance costs, even if not the&#13;
investment itself However, OED and others have found little correlation between higher water&#13;
charges and good O&amp;M, mainly because the revenue usually goes into general treasury receipts&#13;
and is not allocated to O&amp;M. In practice, the key to good O&amp;M is irrigators having financial&#13;
autonomy, paying for and arranging O&amp;M themselves. Financial autonomy depends on linkage,&#13;
or feedback, which might be through a public irrigation authority converted to a water service unit&#13;
with client involvement in management, with the budget dependent on the collection of user fees,&#13;
or successful water user associations.5&#13;
11.   Private Sector Involvement. Bank experience demonstrates that in order to expand&#13;
production and facilitate diversification, investments in irrigation rehabilitation, modernization and&#13;

expansion need complementary investments in institutional strengthening and a range of&#13;
production-related services including technology generation and transfer, animal and plant health,&#13;
technical assistance and marketing. Greater efficiency may involve privatization, and agricultural&#13;
projects should strive to integrate the private sector wherever possible, limiting government's role&#13;
to a narrower focus on: (i) creating an enabling policy framework for production and market&#13;
efficiency; (ii) funding public goods, principally in agricultural research and extension and rural&#13;
infrastructure, and leaving their delivery, operation and maintenance, wherever feasible, to private&#13;
agents; (iii) funding targeted interventions needed to correct market failures and address acute&#13;
poverty or food security issues, but devolving their execution to private entities; and (iv) building&#13;
institutional capacity so that public service functions appropriate to the role of government are&#13;
carried out efficiently. Governments are often ill-equipped to handle this more limited role,&#13;
especially at the decentralized levels.6&#13;
12.   Institutional Development. Institutional development has been a common feature of&#13;
Bank operations for decades. To a great extent the sustainability of development depends on the&#13;
character and performance of institutions at all levels. While components aimed at strengthening&#13;
institutions figured in a high proportion of Bank-financed operations, and the approaches used&#13;
have been diverse, many such components have failed to have lasting effect. Evidence suggests&#13;
there are no generalized prescriptions.&#13;
13.   According to OED, satisfactory institutional development performance is closely linked to&#13;
realistic project objectives, and an evolving set of sector-specific experiences. Bank experience&#13;
suggests that institutional development requires a longer time horizon than physical aspects; that&#13;
"learning by doing" is also important, both for the borrower and the Bank; that institutional&#13;
stability is a key factor; and that success is more likely when the groundwork has been laid in&#13;
previous projects. There has been a high correlation in Bank projects between good institutional&#13;
development and healthy economic rates of return. Institutional factors which contribute to&#13;
observed cross-country differences in overall project performance are: (i) the extent and nature of&#13;
beneficiary involvement in project design and implementation; (ii) the capacity to mobilize&#13;
financial resources for recurrent expenditures; (iii) the presence of clearly-defined, longer-term&#13;
national and sectoral development strategies; and (iv) levels of education, skills, organizational&#13;
capabilities, and inter-institutional linkages.&#13;
14.   Irrigation experience shows that irrigation development programs should be planned and&#13;
designed on the basis of a comprehensive set of institutional and policy decisions which cover a&#13;
wide range of issues affecting the sector. Such programs call for the development of skilled&#13;
personnel at the federal, provincial and local levels, capable of implementing them. Institutional&#13;
and policy aspects have coalesced around three basic principles: (i) agricultural and engineering&#13;
aspects are not separated in designing and managing irrigation systems; (ii) irrigation systems are&#13;
designed to achieve flexible and efficient water distribution, to facilitate system operation, and to&#13;
ensure easy and prompt use of land and water on-farm; and (iii) farmers are required to maximize&#13;

their production, to fully use water resources available from government investments, to repay&#13;
part of these investments and to contribute the full cost of operation and maintenance.7&#13;
15.    Technical Assistance for Institutional Development. Technical assistance is the&#13;
mechanism most commonly used in Bank projects to strengthen institutions, but the Bank's&#13;
experience has been mixed. The lessons are: (i) the need for a high level of commitment and&#13;
mutual interest on the part of the donor and borrower; (ii) project design that capitalizes on&#13;
existing opportunities and exploits the comparative advantage of different donors in a&#13;
complementary fashion, within the context of an identified, country-specific, institutional&#13;
development strategy; and (iii) a thorough linkage with Bank sector work. Effective technical&#13;
assistance programs have tended to be flexible, based closely on the beneficiary's needs and skills,&#13;
subject to frequent review, modification, and supervision, and focused on strengthening technical,&#13;
managerial, or administrative systems. Attention to legal issues is also important, including: the&#13;
regulatory framework in which projects are carried out; the rules that define the powers,&#13;
functions, and responsibilities of institutions as well as their interrelationships; and legal measures&#13;
to ensure the sustainability of institutions. Institutional analysis up-front is essential.8&#13;
16.   Technology and Marketing. Agricultural technology development is an essential&#13;
complement to irrigation improvement, and needs to be better designed and used. Public, private&#13;
and NGO research efforts should be amalgamated, and there should be more precise identification&#13;
and alleviation of technology gaps impeding greater productivity in areas deemed to require&#13;
reconversion, modernization or which have special promise. Technology transfer programs&#13;
should be designed to match local fiscal, institutional and human resources, and existing farm&#13;
conditions; have a strong participatory basis in project design, problem definition and solution,&#13;
including all potential stakeholders, public and private; and be based on a thorough understanding&#13;
of farming systems in the areas served. Marketing services are an area in which government's role&#13;
remains critical: in the modernization of marketing facilities; in market information services,&#13;
grower organizazion and access to international markets; and in the establishing of standards and&#13;

B. BANK LENDING EXPERIENCE IN ARGENTINA&#13;
17.   The current lending portfolio in Argentina comprises 32 loans, principally in the&#13;
infrastructure and finance sectors, totaling US$5.4 billion. The Bank has undertaken eight&#13;
operations in the agriculture sector since 1967, five of which are closed. Periodic economic and&#13;
sectoral difficulties and institutional weaknesses have constituted a daunting context for project&#13;
planning and execution, affecting commitment and counterpart funding, timely implementation,&#13;

and the sustainability of project benefits. The most recent projects, from where significant lessons&#13;
for the proposed project could be learned, are the Agricultural Credit II Project (Loan 2970-AR;&#13;
closed in 1993) and the ongoing Agricultural Services and Institutional Development Project&#13;
(Loan 3297-AR-PROMSA). The credit project, oriented to small and medium export-oriented&#13;
farmers, successfully recapitalized the sector and increased producer confidence during a period&#13;
of macroeconomic instability and hyperinflation. This project disbursed rapidly and was&#13;
completed two years earlier than planned, due to pent-up demand for investment credit. Indirectly,&#13;
it demonstrated that to achieve sustainable development, projects should complement and deepen&#13;
processes launched under preceding operations.&#13;
18.   The implementation of PROMSA, which finances the modernization of public Federal&#13;
agencies providing support services in animal health, technology research and transfer, plant&#13;
protection, information systems and others, has benefited from the greatly improved economic&#13;
context resulting from sweeping changes in macroeconomic policies and management.&#13;
Furthermore, PROMSA's strengthening of Federal capacity has paved the way for the more&#13;
decentralized approach under the proposed project. Several relevant lessons have already been&#13;
integrated into the design of the follow-on project: (i) cofinancing avoids competition between&#13;
lending institutions and duplication of effort, ensures consistent responses to Government when&#13;
new issues arise and permits cost savings through the use of a single project implementation unit;&#13;
(ii) projects promoting and extending decentralization need an entity at the regional or national&#13;
level, which is technically capable of and responsible for assuring consistency across&#13;
methodologies and across provinces, and should be prepared to delegate and share with local&#13;
institutions the implementation of activities; (iii) farmers' organizations should have a role in&#13;
service delivery and cost-sharing along with federal and local entities; and (iv) projects need to&#13;
work with provincial governments, even though they may have restricted implementation&#13;
capacity.&#13;
19.   Although outside the agricultural sector, a rather similar project is the ongoing Provincial&#13;
Development Project (Loan 3280-AR). By providing financial support to provincial investment&#13;
and institutional strengthening subprojects, this operation seeks to help provinces to undertake&#13;
their own adjustment programs, leading to revenue enhancement and expenditure control,&#13;
improvements in local financial management, and the rationalization of investment decisions at the&#13;
provincial level. This US$200 million loan became effective in July 1991 and, although proceeds&#13;
are now fully committed, disbursements have lagged behind ever since. The main lessons learned,&#13;
all of which have been addressed in this proposed project, are the following: (i) it is essential to&#13;
give top priority to the institutional strengthening aspects, starting during project preparation and&#13;
intensifying them at implementation, in order to have competent executing agencies at the&#13;
provincial level; (ii) procurement of goods and services, and the management of project funds,&#13;
are two crucial areas on which early training and technical assistance produce an important payoff&#13;
during implementation; (iii) the existence of a large number of small, rather complex subprojects&#13;
spread over several sectors and covering many different provinces, only contributes to increasing&#13;
the complexity during implementation; (iv) clear definition of the project scope, and having a&#13;
portfolio of subprojects ready before effectiveness, are key factors for a smooth execution and&#13;
fast disbursements at early stages of implementation; and (v) careful assessment of local&#13;
government's commitment and a realistic estimate of the level of counterpart funds to be made&#13;
available are key considerations when analyzing alternative subproject proposals.&#13;

C. PROJECT STRATEGY&#13;
20.   Several new agricultural projects outside the LAC Region, while not identical to the&#13;
proposed project in Argentina, are similar both strategically and in their objectives and content.&#13;
The Morocco Irrigated Areas Agricultural Services Project is part of Government's strategy to&#13;
create a more productive and flexible agricultural sector which can respond to the opening of the&#13;
Moroccan economy and trade opportunities with the European Community and other markets.&#13;
Its objectives are to raise agricultural productivity; improve the availability and operating&#13;
efficiency of agricultural services; promote commodity and service-oriented farmers' organizations&#13;
to take an increasing share in development activities; and involve universities and other entities in&#13;
extension and research development. The focus is strongly on decentralization of services,&#13;
empowerment of farmers, and better organization of existing services including irrigation (with&#13;
rehabilitation preceding new investment), more participatory approaches, and divesting public&#13;
agricultural services to private agents where feasible. The price for sound performance in&#13;
Morocco has been a heavy government role, which has evolved over time, and which is now being&#13;
markedly reduced in favor of greater farmer and private sector participation.&#13;
21.   The China Agricultural Support Services Project, while not revolving around irrigation,&#13;
seeks to increase agricultural production and farmers' incomes by strengthening institutions that&#13;
supply support services to farmers. The project would address animal husbandry and animal and&#13;
plant quarantine management; decentralize crop and livestock extension services from the national&#13;
to the county level; improve extension services through training, better facilities, and farm-level,&#13;
demand-driven research programs; promote seed commercialization; strengthen veterinary and&#13;
preventive animal health services, establish a national breed improvement program and tighten&#13;
agro-chemical and feed quality control; and promote cost recovery for services to farmers.&#13;
Benefits are expected to be improved policy formulation, stronger agricultural institutions, input&#13;
and market development, and competitive input supply services. Greater weight is given to local&#13;
interventions, linkages between provincial and lower level agricultural services, and marketing.&#13;
22.   Finally, the India Assam Rural Infrastructure and Agricultural Services Project is a&#13;
program of targeted interventions for rural poverty alleviation which seeks to accelerate&#13;
agricultural growth and income generation in the State of Assam through the improved use of&#13;
resources, relieving infrastructural and technical constraints, fostering private sector development&#13;
and sustainability, and improving the state's capacity for strategic agricultural planning. The&#13;
project includes large investments in irrigation and rural roads, complemented by significant&#13;
finding for institutional development including technology generation and transfer, education,&#13;
training and land administration; and poverty alleviation, through fisheries, horticulture and&#13;
livestock development. Beneficiary participation is a central theme, and to the extent possible, the&#13;
project would transfer or lease production assets to local beneficiary groups. Of particular&#13;
interest is the reliance on and expansion of various participatory entities including NGOs, water&#13;
user groups, and field management committees (FMCs), the latter a successful mechanism for&#13;
managing common community assets including irrigation systems, for introducing new crop&#13;
varieties, and for organizing input and marketing services. State involvement in activities better&#13;
suited for the private sector would be avoided; this would be facilitated through policy adjustment&#13;
whereby the State would create an economic environment conducive to the promotion of the&#13;
private sector in agriculture.&#13;

The seven investment subprojects intended to be financed by the Bank, four provincial&#13;
irrigation/drainage subprojects and three regional subprojects (animal health/phytosanitary&#13;
services), are discussed below. The funding arrangements for Group A priority subprojects&#13;
between the Bank, IDB and the Government are presented in the Project Cost and Financing&#13;
Sections (Annexes C and D).&#13;
1. Province ofBuenos Aires: Development of the Colorado River Valley&#13;
(Baseline Cost US$13.4 million)&#13;
1.1   Description. The Colorado River Valley, located in the Southern part of the Buenos&#13;
Aires province, covers 700 thousand ha, of which 425 thousand ha are agriculturally productive.&#13;
Nearly 138 thousand ha, owned by 1,373 farmers, have irrigation concessions, of which only&#13;
68 thousand ha actually receive irrigation. Most farms, about 70%, have extensions under 200 ha.&#13;
Agricultural production, with an annual value in 1992 of US$54 million, consists of cereals,&#13;
forage seeds, vegetables and livestock. The region is characterized by a very active private&#13;
sector, which developed over two-thirds of the regional irrigation and drainage systems, and a&#13;
substantial degree of agricultural diversification, aimed at the growing markets derived from&#13;
MERCOSUR.&#13;
1.2   The Development Corporation of the Valley of the Colorado River (Corporaci6n de&#13;
Fomento del Valle Bonaerense del Rio Colorado, CORFO-RC), a decentralized and autonomous&#13;
agency under the Provincial Ministry of Economy, has administered the irrigation and drainage&#13;
system since 1960. With the assistance of the Water Users Associations (Consorcios de&#13;
Regantes), groups of producers sharing water from the same canal, CORFO-RC collects users&#13;
tariffs and encourages active users participation in the operation and maintenance of the system.&#13;
In addition, CORFO-RC has constructed a drainage network to reduce salinization of the land,&#13;
developed a rotating access system based on users' needs, and established a crop diversification&#13;
program.&#13;
1.3   Main Problems. Area development has stagnated as macroeconomic conditions have&#13;
changed relative prices, requiring increased managerial ability in order to maximize resource&#13;
productivity. Producers have not been able to put together production packages with adequate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                                  Annex B&#13;
technology, capable of generating enough revenue to keep abreast of the increasing cost of living.&#13;
In addition, CORFO-RC and the water users face serious problems of low efficiency in water&#13;
distribution, water losses, and flooding, resulting from an incomplete drainage network and the&#13;
operation of an upstream hydroelectric dam which has modified the physical characteristics of the&#13;
water supplied to the system. These negative effects raised the demand for maintenance and its&#13;
associated costs, and lowered water availability in some sectors of the system due to higher water&#13;
losses.&#13;
1.4    A recent water resources study"0 indicated that the average efficiency level for the regional&#13;
irrigation systems is 38% of the optimal level, due to deteriorated central infrastructure and&#13;
evapotranspiration and infiltration losses. On-farm inefficiencies, related to poor on-farm&#13;
technologies, maintenance and practices were particularly pronounced. Economic adjustment and&#13;
austerity requires CORFO-RC to manage better its financial and technical resources and increase&#13;
coordination with the private sector.&#13;
1.5    Objectives. The subproject would set in place a sustainable system for technology&#13;
generation and transfer aimed at consolidating horticulture production in the region; it would also&#13;
set in motion the first phase of a program to line secondary canals aimed at increasing the overall&#13;
efficiency of the irrigation system. The subproject is expected to increase production, promote&#13;
diversification into high-valued horticultural crops and local employment, as well as improve&#13;
productivity and marketing, thereby increasing and stabilizing household incomes. In addition, it&#13;
would provide valuable information and experience to help design the plan for improving the rest&#13;
of the irrigated area.&#13;
1.6    Components. The subproject, which would improve the well-being of farm families&#13;
through the stimulation of the regional economy, would include the following components:&#13;
(i) Agricultural Research and Extension (cost: US$ 8.0 million), that would establish a&#13;
competitively-based system of technology generation and transfer, executed by qualified regional&#13;
institutions ( INTA, universities, consultants, professionals and producer organizations, etc.),&#13;
designed to orient regional horticultural production and marketing to expanding international&#13;
markets; (ii) Improvement of Irrigation Infrastructure (cost: US$3.2 million), which would&#13;
rehabilitate and improve the infrastructure of existing irrigation systems (line 34 km of secondary&#13;
irrigation canals serving 52 producers, and some critical sections of the main canal); and&#13;
(iii) Institutional Strengthening (cost: US$2.2 million), that would strengthen CORFO-RC, the&#13;
project implementing agency.&#13;
1.7    Costs and Financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$13.4 million, of&#13;
which US$3.3 million are for civil works, US$1.1 million for vehicles and equipment,&#13;
US$2.3 million for technical assistance, US$1.4 million for training, and the remaining&#13;
US$5.3 mnillion would be used for financing incremental recurrent costs. Total costs, considering&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                               Annex B&#13;
physical and price contingencies, amount to US$15.1 million, including US$1.7 million of taxes.&#13;
The Bank would finance an estimated US$11.6 million of this total cost, and the provincial&#13;
Government the remaining US$3.5 million.&#13;
1.8   Benefits. The subproject, which has a Net Present Value"' (NPV) of net benefits of&#13;
US$54.7 rmillion (over a 20-year period), and an estimated Internal Economic Rate of Return&#13;
(IERR) of about 39%, would benefit directly 570 and indirectly 1,370 farm families within the&#13;
region, as well as more than 1,000 farmers outside the region.&#13;
1.9   Implementation. Subproject execution would be the responsibility of CORFO-RC, the&#13;
current administrator of the irrigation system. About 60 percent of the investment cost of&#13;
irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, and all operation and maintenance costs, would be covered&#13;
by water tariffs to be collected by CORFO-RC. Civil works for rehabilitation, as well as for&#13;
repair and maintenance, would be carried out by private contractors.&#13;
2. Province of Mendoza: Montecaseros Drainage and Irrigation&#13;
(Baseline Cost- US$5.2 million)&#13;
2.1   Description. The subproject is located in the Northeastern area of the province. It is&#13;
placed at the Montecaseros basin, in the mid-section of the Tunuyan river causeway, and covers&#13;
1,279 farms over 8,531 ha. It is a highly urbanized area, with a well developed roadway system,&#13;
encompassing the cities of San Martin (population: 98,000 people) at the heart of the basin,&#13;
Palmira (5 km to the north), Junin (4 km to the south, with a population of 28,500 people) and&#13;
Rivadavia (7 km to the south, 47,000 people).&#13;
2.2   The area occupied by farms larger than 1 ha in size is 7,667 ha, 84% (6,434 ha) of which&#13;
is under production, 10% (781 ha) is abandoned due to low productivity (265 ha due to high&#13;
water table problems), and 6% (452 ha) is set aside. Most of the area under production (78%,&#13;
5,018 ha) is covered with wine vineyards, while the rest is devoted mainly to peach production&#13;
(22%, 1,416 ha). The majority of grape produced (93%, 4,675 ha) is common table grape of&#13;
lesser quality and low yields.&#13;
2.3   The Montecaseros canal is a secondary canal located in the Tunuyan river mid-section and&#13;
connects to the San Martin primary canal, one of the five primary canals diverting water from the&#13;
Tunuyan river north of the El Carrizal reservoir. It is 11.7 km long, 40% of which (4.7 km) is not&#13;
lined. Poor infrastructure conditions and low maintenance levels in many areas, have resulted in&#13;
leakage problems and low system efficiency, which coupled with the excessive irrigation volumes&#13;
used by farmers, have caused drainage problems. This in turn has led to a high water table,&#13;
increased soil salinity, reduced yields, larger dependency on water pumping from deep wells, and&#13;
higher costs of production.&#13;
11 12% annual discount rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -                                Annex B&#13;
2.4   Main Problems. The main problems detected are: (i) high water losses due to the&#13;
limited lining of main (28 percent) and secondary canals (60 percent), light textured soils, and&#13;
type of water supplied (free of sediments that may naturally line the canals); (ii) inadequate water&#13;
distribution system that supplies large volumes of water in short periods of time; (iii) lack of&#13;
knowledge about crop patterns and real water needs by system managers, resulting in poor&#13;
programming of water distribution; (iv) inadequate system maintenance (both at the system and&#13;
the farm level); and (v) high water table levels in areas adjacent to the canal, resulting in damages&#13;
to crops, roads and buildings.&#13;
2.5    Objectives. The subproject would improve farmers income by: (i) increasing farm output,&#13;
through expansion in planted area and improved yields, as well as increased harvest value,&#13;
through diversification into higher-quality fruits, especially grapes and peaches; and (ii) reducing&#13;
farm production costs by lowering irrigation costs. Through the project, regional employment&#13;
opportunities would grow due to the introduction of more labor-intensive activities.&#13;
2.6   Components. Actions proposed would improve the Montecaseros irrigation system&#13;
through: (i) Improvement of Irrigation Infrastructure (cost: US$1.8 million), which would&#13;
rehabilitate 4.65 km. of the Montecaseros canal, including the installation of volume meters;&#13;
install basin meters at the entrance of the tertiary canals and direct intakes; implement 568&#13;
irrigation intakes, and increase irrigation efficiency by adjusting the water users rotation system to&#13;
crop plans and establishing more rational water user tariffs; (ii) User Training (cost:&#13;
US$0.3 million) which would train users to better manage water resources and maintain canals;&#13;
(iii) Improvement of Drainage Infrastructure (cost: US$1.8 million), which would rehabilitate&#13;
38.6 km of the drainage system to prevent flooding; (iv) Agricultural Research (cost:&#13;
US$0.4 million) which would develop a program to support applied agricultural research to&#13;
increase agricultural productivity, especially from fruit crops; and (v) Agricultural Extension&#13;
(cost: US$0.9 million), which would develop a program to provide agricultural extension, transfer&#13;
technologies and promote producer organizations for small farmers.&#13;
2.7   Costs and Financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$5.2 million, of&#13;
which US$3.5 million are for civil works, US$ 0.2 million for vehicles and equipment, US$1.2&#13;
million for technical assistance and US$0.3 million for training. Total costs, considering physical&#13;
and price contingencies, amount to US$5.9 million, including US$0.9 million of taxes. The Bank&#13;
would finance an estimated US$5.0 million of this total cost, and the provincial Government the&#13;
remaining US$0.9 million.&#13;
2.8   Benefits. More than 1,000 producers would benefit directly from the subproject, which&#13;
has an estimated IERR above 21%, and a NPV of net benefits of US$7.4 million (at 12%&#13;
discount rate, over a 20-year period).&#13;
2.9   Implementation. Subproject execution would be the responsibility of the provincial&#13;
irrigation authority, the Irrigation General Department (Departamento General de Irrigaci6n,&#13;
DGI), the current administrator of the irrigation system. The direct beneficiaries would reimburse&#13;
about 60 percent of investment costs through an annual quota. In addition, users would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                               Annex B&#13;
expected to pay full operation and maintenance costs through user tariffs. All civil works would&#13;
be carried out by private contractors following the Bank's guidelines and procedures. The applied&#13;
research and the extension services would be contracted out through a competitive process&#13;
following the Bank's guidelines for consulting services, and with strong beneficiary participation&#13;
in the process.&#13;
3. Province of Mendoza: Strengthening of the Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Program&#13;
(Baseline Cost-US$13.2 million)&#13;
3.1   Description. In the Province of Mendoza, all water resources are administered by the&#13;
Irrigation General Department (Departamento General de Irrigaci6n, DGI), a decentralized,&#13;
autonomous public entity, under the Provincial Ministry of Works and Services (Ministerio de&#13;
Obrasy Servicios, MOS). The Governor, with Senate approval, nominates the DGI&#13;
Superintendent. Every river is administered by a DGI Water Sub-delegate. Watershed&#13;
Associations (Inspecciones de Cauce, IC), public representatives of the community of irrigation&#13;
users, are responsible for the administration of the system. ICs administer 720 of the 1,700&#13;
provincial watersheds.&#13;
3.2   Each of Mendoza's five principal irrigation zones ( Mendoza River, Upper Tunuyan River,&#13;
Lower Tunuyan River, Diamante River and Atuel River) has a representative in the Council of&#13;
Appeals (Consejo de Apelaciones, CA). The Administrative Tribunal, made up of the five CAs&#13;
and the DGI Superintendent, sets the annual DGI budget, water users' tariff, names and removes&#13;
personnel, approves elections of the ICs, and establishes the norms and regulations for the&#13;
provincial irrigation system.&#13;
3.3    Objectives. This subproject would support the DGI through institutional strengthening,&#13;
training and technical assistance. It would also provide support to the Fund for Minor Works,&#13;
which would allow DGI to carry out repairs and improvement work of comparatively low unit&#13;
value in different sections of the provincial irrigation system.&#13;
3.4   Components. Actions proposed include Institutional Strengthening (cost: US$6.8&#13;
million) which would improve DGI's capacity to (a) develop short-and long- term environmental&#13;
and irrigation plans; (b) design appropriate user tariffs and rotation schedules to increase water&#13;
use efficiency; and (c) prepare feasibility studies for future investment subprojects to be financed&#13;
under this and other projects. The subproject would also analyze the feasibility of introducing&#13;
alternative cost recovery schemes, including partial or full investment cost recovery. Along with&#13;
capital cost recovery, the study would assess the possibility of gradually transferring ownership of&#13;
infrastructure to water users groups (as is the practice in Chile for some publicly supported&#13;
irrigation systems), given the prevailing institutional and market conditions in Mendoza.&#13;
3.5   In addition, the subproject would provide financial and technical assistance to the Fund&#13;
for Minor Works (Fondo de Obras Menores, FOM) (cost: US$6.5 million), to be used for&#13;
comparatively low unit value rehabilitation and reconstruction work in different sections of the&#13;
irrigation and drainage systems, other than the ones with specific subprojects (Constituci6n and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                               Annex B&#13;
Montecaseros). This fund would allow urgently needed rehabilitation or improvement works to&#13;
be carried out, which would help prevent higher costs and losses arising from breakdowns in the&#13;
system.&#13;
3.6   Costs and Financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$13.2 million, of&#13;
which US$6.5 million are for civil works, US$0.4 million for vehicles and equipment, US$3.5&#13;
million for technical assistance and training, and the remaining US$2.8 million would be devoted&#13;
to recurrent costs. Total costs, including physical and price contingencies, amount to&#13;
US$14.9 million, including US$1.9 million in taxes. The Bank would finance an estimated&#13;
US$11.8 million of this total cost, and the provincial Government the remaining US$3.1 million.&#13;
3.7   Benefits. The estimated IERR for the subproject, based solely on the calculation of&#13;
benefits from the Minor Works component, exceeds 20%, and the corresponding NPV of net&#13;
benefits would total US$2.7 million (calculated over a 20-year period at 12% discount rate).&#13;
Avoidance of production losses due to unexpected breakages in the system, plus a better overall&#13;
functioning of the system would be the main benefits. The work scheduled for the first two years&#13;
of implementation would repair sections of a system that covers 90,700 ha and provides service to&#13;
10,200 users.&#13;
3.8   Implementation. Subproject execution would be the responsibility of the provincial&#13;
irrigation authority, the DGI, the present administrator of all irrigation systems. Cost recovery&#13;
would cover 80% of the investment costs in Minor Works, as well as 100% of 0 &amp; M costs,&#13;
through additional tariffs to be paid by the users and collected by their associations (Inspecciones&#13;
de Cauce).&#13;
4. Province of Santa Fe: Pozo Borrado Flood Control and Drainage&#13;
(Baseline Cost-US$5.9 million)&#13;
4.1    Description. The subproject is located in the Northeastern region of the province. It is&#13;
placed in the 9 de Julio and Vera departments, and covers 400,000 ha west of the Golondrinas&#13;
brook, which provides natural drainage to the area. The region is characterized land of low&#13;
permeability, which easily floods under excessive rain conditions. The main locality in the area is&#13;
Pozo Borrado (population: 1,700 people), situated near Highway 35, in the western edge of the&#13;
subproject area. There are 312 farms in the region. Smaller crop/dairy production units&#13;
predominate to the west, and larger livestock production units become predominant in the&#13;
lowlands eastern region.&#13;
4.2   Main Problems. Low permeability of soils and very flat terrain are the main determinants&#13;
of floods when excessive rains occur in the region. As agricultural production increased in the&#13;
western half of the subproject area, construction of a network of canals/roads was started to&#13;
minimize flood damage. Between 1991 and 1993, the average economic costs due to agricultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                                 Annex B&#13;
losses from floods in the region were estimated at US$110 million annually. Since 1972, the&#13;
region has been officially declared in a state of emergency eleven times because of heavy floods.&#13;
4.3   Farmners in the region are keenly aware of the importance of good flood protection works&#13;
to their livelihoods. Through their Watershed Committees (Comites de Cuencas), and using&#13;
machinery from the provincial government, they construct flood gullies running parallel to the&#13;
roads. The Watershed Comrnmittees collect tariffs and finance much flood control work in the&#13;
province. Tariff collection is presently very effective, with a recovery rate greater than 90%.&#13;
4.4    However, much of the farmer-constructed flood protection works are poorly designed,&#13;
and the effectiveness of this existing network is very low, since it has not been connected to its&#13;
natural drain to the east. In some cases these works have created more severe flooding problems&#13;
for farmers farther downstream, so its net overall effect is probably negative, as it only partially&#13;
alleviates problems in the higher western region, but it worsens conditions in the eastern lowlands.&#13;
The subproject would address these problems, reorienting many of the flood control works,&#13;
including redirecting flood gullies, to increase their effectiveness.&#13;
4.5    Objectives. The subproject would expand and improve the existing flood protection&#13;
infrastructure in order to: (i) reduce the impact of flooding on production, (ii) stabilize and&#13;
increase farm income; and (iii) protect natural resources. The subproject would directly benefit&#13;
312 producers, in addition to stimulating the agricultural and agro-industrial economies.&#13;
4.6    Components. The subproject has the following components: (i) Infrastructure&#13;
Rehabilitation and Expansion (cost: US$5.6 million), which would recondition 424 km. of the&#13;
existing network of irrigation canals and drains, and construct 32 km of complementary new&#13;
canals; (ii) Environmental Impact Assessment (cost: US$0.2 million), which would monitor the&#13;
implementation to verify compliance with the environmental standards and regulations, and assess&#13;
subproject's environmental impacts to capitalize significant lessons for the design of similar&#13;
subprojects in the future; and (iii) Institutional Strengthening (cost: US$0.1 million), which&#13;
would strengthen Watershed Committees and irrigation water user groups through training and&#13;
the establishment of a Project Unit, responsible for subproject implementation and supervision.&#13;
4.7    Costs and Financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$5.9 million, of&#13;
which US$5.2 million are for civil works, US$0.1 million for vehicles and equipment,&#13;
US$0.3 million for technical assistance and training, and the remaining US$0.3 million for&#13;
recurrent costs. Total costs, including physical and price contingencies, amount to US$6.9&#13;
rnillion, including US$1.3 million of taxes. The Bank would finance an estimated US$5.5 million&#13;
of this total cost, and the provincial Government the remaining US$1.4 million.&#13;
4.8    Benefits and Implementation. The estimated IERR for the subproject exceeds 23%, and&#13;
the NPV of net benefits is estimated at US$2.5 million (at a 12% annual discount rate over a&#13;
20-year period). Subproject execution would be responsibility of the Provincial Ministry of Public&#13;
&#13;

Works, Services and Housing (Ministerio de Obras, Servicios Putblicos y Vivienda) of the Santa&#13;
Fe Province. Cost recovery would cover 70% of investment costs and 100% for 0 &amp; M costs.&#13;
5. Provinces of Catamarca, Jujuy, Salta and Tucumn: Strengthening the Phytosanitary&#13;
Services in the Northwestern Region (NOA) (Baseline Cost- US$15.8 million)&#13;
5.1    Description. The subproject is located in the Northwestern Region of Argentina (NOA),&#13;
and covers the provinces of Catamarca, Jujuy, Tucuman and Salta. The NOA Region produces&#13;
principally sugarcane, soybeans, tobacco, citrus fruits and vegetables. It covers 38.1 million ha, of&#13;
which 1.1 million are devoted to agriculture, including 41,000 ha planted with citrus, 12,500 ha&#13;
planted with other fruit trees, and 1 0,000 ha devoted to horticulture production. The area is free&#13;
of citrus canker, but plant diseases such as fruit-fly and black spot affect regional production,&#13;
especially its dynamic, export-oriented citrus sub-sector, precluding entry of its exports to&#13;
premium international markets.&#13;
5.2   Main Problems. The zone has been successful in maintaining citrus canker free status.&#13;
Nevertheless, the present vigilance system needs upgrading to ensure continued adequate control&#13;
of vegetable products and live plant material entering the area. In addition, international markets&#13;
are setting increasingly stringent quality and sanitary regulations. The region must take the&#13;
challenge of meeting these standards if it is to keep its current markets (second largest lemon&#13;
exporter in the world), and if it wants to include premium markets among its export destinations.&#13;
5.3   Objectives. This regional subproject would ensure that the agricultural products, sub-&#13;
products and derivatives from the NOA Region meet the quality and health standards required by&#13;
the domestic and international markets. In particular, the subproject would strengthen the&#13;
national and provincial programs to control and eradicate diseases and insects whose presence&#13;
preclude shipment of regional fruit to many international markets. The proposed actions would&#13;
decrease production costs by reducing expenditure in agro-chemicals, increase production, and&#13;
expand export markets access.&#13;
5.4   Components. The subproject components would include: (i) Fruit Fly Eradication&#13;
(cost: US$7.0 million), which would conduct a five-year campaign to eradicate the fruit fly and&#13;
obtain international certification as a fruit fly-free zone; (ii) Citrus Canker Monitoring (cost:&#13;
US$0.1 million), which would strengthen and support the ongoing citrus canker monitoring&#13;
program and allow international certification as a disease-free zone, (iii) Toxic Residue Control&#13;
(cost: US$0.6 million), which would monitor toxic residue in agricultural products, ensuring that&#13;
the levels meet accepted national and international standards; (iv) Phytosanitary Protection (cost:&#13;
US$4.1 million for sanitary barriers, and US$1.6 million for a Plague and Disease Diagnostic&#13;
Center), which would enhance plant health protection, including strengthening of phytosanitary&#13;
barriers, through investments in equipment, infrastructure and training, (v) Certification of Black&#13;
Spot and Citrus Mange Free Production (cost: US$0.1 million), which would establish a&#13;
program to certify producers free of black spot and citric mange; and (vi) Institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                               Annex B&#13;
Strengthening (cost: US$2.4 million), which would strengthen provincial institutions through&#13;
training programs.&#13;
5.5   Costs and financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$15.8 million, of&#13;
which US$2.0 million are for civil works, US$3.9 million for vehicles and equipment,&#13;
US$1.5 million for technical assistance and training, and the remaining US$8.4 million would be&#13;
devoted to recurrent costs. Total costs, including physical and price contingencies, amount to&#13;
US$17.8 million, including US$2.7 million of taxes. The Bank would finance an estimated&#13;
US$11.8 million of this total cost, the Beneficiaries an additional US$4.6 million, and the&#13;
provincial Government the remaining US$1.4 million.&#13;
5.6   Benefits. The subproject has an estimated internal economic return above 18% and an&#13;
NPV of net benefits of US$18.7 million (over 20 years, at a 12% annual discount rate). In the&#13;
short term, the subproject would directly benefit 1,000 citrus growers and their families, and the&#13;
agricultural public sector of the respective provinces. In the medium term, the subproject would&#13;
directly benefit 30,000 citrus growers and their families, impacting on the regional economy and&#13;
reducing potentially negative environmental effects.&#13;
5.7   Implementation. Subproject execution would be under the coordination of the National&#13;
Service for Food and Agricultural Sanitation and Quality (Servicio Nacional de Sanidady&#13;
CalidadAgroalimentaria, SENASA). The subproject operational costs would be fully covered&#13;
through producer fees charged for project services by SENASA.&#13;
6. Provinces of Corrientes, Entre Rios and Misiones: Strengthening of Animal Health&#13;
Services and Controls in Mesopotamia (Baseline Cost-US$20.9 million)&#13;
6.1    Description. The subproject is located in the Mesopotamia region in Northeastern&#13;
Argentina, which includes Corrientes, Entre Rios and Misiones provinces. The region covers two&#13;
rnillion square kilometers, has a population of over 2.1 million people, and contains 72,600&#13;
livestock producers with 8.9 million head of cattle (17% of Argentine's total beef livestock). The&#13;
area has been free of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) for the last two years; vaccination, which is&#13;
still mandatory, is carried out systematically and with high coverage. Favorable geographic&#13;
characteristics (surrounded by rivers) gives the region a strong comparative advantage through&#13;
very favorable conditions for the eradication of the disease.&#13;
6.2   Main Problems. The zone has been probably the most successful Argentine region in&#13;
achieving systematic, high levels of bovine immunization against FMD, as well as efficient control&#13;
of movement and entry of possible virus vehicles into the area. This has translated into a long&#13;
period without outbreaks, and motivated producers and authorities to seek cease of vaccination,&#13;
as a first step to attain international recognition as an FMD-free zone. In order to discontinue&#13;
vaccination, the existing sanitary barrier and other prevention systems must be upgraded to meet&#13;
international standards, and a monitoring and surveillance system in place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                                 Annex B&#13;
6.3    As a result of the significant progress made in the campaign against FMD disease,&#13;
Mesopotamia has been, since 1992, an "FMD-free zone with vaccination." Once the region can&#13;
become internationally certified as an "FMD-free zone without vaccination," meat from the region&#13;
could gain access to higher priced FMD-free markets, including the United States, Europe, Asia&#13;
and certain MERCOSLTR markets. Annual losses associated with the presence of FMD are&#13;
estimated at around US$100 million.&#13;
6.4    Objectives. This subproject would establish the necessary sanitary infrastructure and&#13;
logistic conditions for adequate monitoring and prevention in order for Mesopotamia to be&#13;
internationally recognized as an "FMD-free with vaccination", and to eventually become certified&#13;
as an "FMD-free without vaccination" zone.&#13;
6.5    Once internationally certified, regional fresh meat could gain access to profitable&#13;
FMD-free export markets, which would stimulate regional development of the livestock&#13;
sub-sector by increasing agricultural returns and reducing production costs. It is estimated that&#13;
more than 70,000 livestock growers and their families would directly benefit from this subproject.&#13;
6.6   The subproject would also address other problems affecting the productivity and&#13;
profitability of the livestock sector, such as brucellosis, tuberculosis, ticks and mange. Regional&#13;
economic losses due to these diseases and insects are estimated at US$50 million per year. The&#13;
project would strengthen meat safety controls, increase the welfare of domestic consumers, and&#13;
enhance export opportunities. Currently, less than half of the local slaughter plants are publicly&#13;
supervised.&#13;
6.7    Components. The proposed actions include: (i) Surveillance System (cost:&#13;
US$13.6 million), which would establish a system of continuous epidemiological surveillance;&#13;
(ii) Sanitary Barriers (cost: US$3.2 million), to prevent disease reentry by upgrading the current&#13;
sanitary barriers to meet established international sanitary standards; (iii) Sanitary Emergencies&#13;
System (cost: US$1.7 million for sanitary emergencies and US$1.7 million for laboratory&#13;
services), to set in place an emergency health program which would respond rapidly should the&#13;
disease be detected in the zone; and (iv) Institutional Strengthening (cost: US$0.7 million), to&#13;
train public sector personnel and to conduct public education programs.&#13;
6.8    Costs and Financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$20.9 million, of&#13;
which US$0.6 million are for civil works, US$2.8 million for vehicles and equipment,&#13;
US$0.8 million for technical assistance and training, US$1.0 million for the creation of an&#13;
indemnification fund, and the remaining US$15.7 million would be devoted to recurrent costs.&#13;
Total costs, considering physical and price contingencies, amount to US$22.7 million, including&#13;
US$1.5 million of taxes. The Bank would finance an estimated US$6.3 million of this total cost,&#13;
the Beneficiaries an additional US$12.7 million, the Federal Government US$2.4 million, and the&#13;
provincial Government the remaining US$1.3 million.&#13;
6.9    Benefits. The subproject's estimated IERR is close to 35%, and it reflects only the&#13;
portion of the reduction in production costs that can realistically be assigned to this stage of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                               Annex B&#13;
regional FMD eradication campaign. The estimated NPV of net benefits totals US$9.3 million&#13;
calculated over a 20-year period (at a 12% annual discount rate). The subproject would benefit&#13;
72,600 producers spread over 19.7 million ha across three provinces.&#13;
6.10  Implementation. This subproject, as a component of the "National Plan for the&#13;
Eradication of Foot-and-Mouth Disease", would be coordinated by the National Service for Food&#13;
and Agriculture Sanitation and Quality (Servicio Nacional de Sanidady Calidad&#13;
Agroalimentaria, SENASA) in collaboration with the Provincial Commissions of Animal Health&#13;
(Comisiones Provinciales de SanidadAnimal-COPROSA), which are composed of&#13;
representatives of provincial public and private sectors. Through COPROSA, the private sector&#13;
(livestock producers and agro-industries) participates actively in decisions regarding animal health&#13;
programs in their provinces, including the allocation of resources. Producer groups are expected&#13;
to contribute more than 60% of the total costs of this subproject, absorbing most of the&#13;
operational costs, through their actual participation and payment of service fees. The producers&#13;
would pay 1.50 pesos per head of cattle per year for the vaccine and the vaccination service. This&#13;
fee would gradually decrease to 0.30 pesos to cover the costs of disease monitoring and&#13;
surveillance.&#13;
7. Provinces of Chubut, and Santa Cruz: Strengthening of Animal Health Services and&#13;
Controls in Southern Patagonia (Baseline Cost-US$ 8.8 million)&#13;
7.1    Description. The subproject is located in Southern Patagonia, and covers all of Santa&#13;
Cruz and Chubut provinces. This area includes 5,000 livestock producers with about 8.6 million&#13;
head of sheep and 150,000 head of beef cattle. In Patagonia, a region covering 780,000 square&#13;
kilometers, sheep raising for the production of wool is the most important agricultural and third&#13;
most important economic activity. Unlike the other two important regional economic activities,&#13;
fisheries and petrochemical, wool production generates net revenues which are reinvested in the&#13;
local economy. The provinces of Chubut and Santa Cruz, with 39% of the national sheep herd,&#13;
contribute 40% of national wool production. All wool is exported from the region, and half of it&#13;
is exported to international markets. National wool exports represent around US$190 million&#13;
annually.&#13;
7.2   Main Problems. The area is free from Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), but it is not&#13;
internationally recognized as such due to the lax prevention system presently in place.&#13;
Environmental conditions are very harsh in the region, which is semi-desertic and has a low&#13;
livestock carrying capacity. Although barely self-sufficient in beef, the area could benefit from&#13;
beef and lamb exports at higher prices if it were recognized as FMD-free. Wool production has&#13;
declined lately as wool prices have fallen in recent years. This has led to a decrease in&#13;
profitability, followed by cutbacks in animal health expenditures, increased sanitary problems and&#13;
lower productivity. This in turn has given way to problems of large animal stocks, overgrazing,&#13;
and declining natural resource productivity, which contribute to diminishing rates of return.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -                                Annex B&#13;
7.3   Sheep mange is another extremely important sanitary problem in the region, producing&#13;
annual losses estimated at US$5 million. The lack of adequate sanitary barriers precludes&#13;
international recognition of the FMD-free status. This in turn dampens interest in the production&#13;
and export of sheep and lamb meat, which reports an additional estimated US$10 million per year&#13;
to the local economy. The area is also characterized by the high prevalence of zoonotic diseases,&#13;
due to the high incidence of clandestine slaughter, and the little attention paid to these diseases at&#13;
farm level.&#13;
7.4   Because of the ecological constraints already mentioned, particularly desert encroachment,&#13;
increased sheep production would have to be based upon improved productivity rather than&#13;
significant increases in herd size. Increased productivity would require improved animal diet,&#13;
genetics and veterinary management, health and business management. While the individual&#13;
farmer has much control over many of these factors, improvement in animal health and health&#13;
controls requires public sector involvement. Prevailing animal diseases represent regional&#13;
economic costs due to losses in productivity and product quality as well as those associated with&#13;
preventive measures. While, there are "FMD-free without vaccination" zones within the region,&#13;
these lack the international certification permitting entry into higher-priced foreign fresh meat&#13;
markets.&#13;
7.5   The National Service for Food and Agriculture Sanitation and Quality (Servicio Nacional&#13;
de Sanidady CalidadAgroalimentaria, SENASA), through its Office of Health Campaigns&#13;
(Gerencia de Luchas Sanitarias), is responsible for national and inter-provincial animal health and&#13;
meat quality control. SENASA works through the Provincial Commissions of Animal Health&#13;
(Comisiones Provinciales de Sanidad Animal, COPROSA), which are composed of provincial&#13;
authorities and interested private sector participants. Through the COPROSA, livestock&#13;
producers participate actively in provincial decisions regarding animal health programs.&#13;
COPROSA analyzes, proposes and allocates resources for provincial animal health programs.&#13;
Nevertheless, lack of continuity and limited resources, due in part to a diversion of funds and&#13;
personnel resources to the FDM campaign, have debilitated the provincial sheep health protection&#13;
program. The provincial inspection programs of farms, processing plants, abattoirs and animal&#13;
transportation are extremely limited and ineffective. In this respect, the relevant institutions would&#13;
need to be strengthened to provide adequate services during and after project implementation.&#13;
7.6   Animal health campaigns require private and public sector cooperation, with the livestock&#13;
producers playing an essential role in its implementation. As part of the national FMD program,&#13;
producer foundations were created to solidify farm level participation, particularly regarding&#13;
vaccinations. As this organization has proven to be highly effective, it would be replicated in the&#13;
proposed project. The proposed subproject would promote and strengthen farmer associations in&#13;
order to decentralize the health campaign and ensure its sustainability.&#13;
7.7   Objectives. The subproject would reduce the economic damage from, and the risk of&#13;
spread of, the main animal diseases in the region; improve the quality of wool produced;&#13;
guarantee the legal origin and suitability of meat products available for consumption by the&#13;
regional population; and by reducing economic damage would directly benefit 5,000 livestock&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71-                                Annex B&#13;
producers by increasing their net incomes. Expected benefits include: (i) increased sheep and&#13;
cattle productivity; (ii) lower producer costs due to the reduction of disease medications and&#13;
precautions; (iii) increased export returns from greater volumes and better quality wool exports,&#13;
as well as better long term returns from larger sheepmeat exports to higher priced FMD-free&#13;
markets; and (iv) improved consumer protection.&#13;
7.8   Components. The subproject actions would cover: (i) Sanitary Campaign (cost: US$6.9&#13;
million), which would carry out an effective animal health campaign in the region to eliminate&#13;
major sheep and cattle diseases, maintain the region's status as FMD-free without vaccination,&#13;
and satisfy the requirements to obtain international certification of this status; (ii) Meat Inspection&#13;
(cost: US$1.5 rnillion), which would provide effective inspection and control of farms, transport&#13;
facilities and abattoirs to fulfill the provincial responsibilities as contained in the National Meat&#13;
Laws, and would ensure acceptable meat production quality controls for consumers; and (iii)&#13;
Institutional Strengthening (cost: US$0.4 million),which would finance programs to train staff,&#13;
improve inter-institutional coordination and promote private sector participation, especially&#13;
farmer associations.&#13;
7.9   Costs and Financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$8.8 million, of&#13;
which US$0.4 million are for civil works, US$0.5 million for vehicles and equipment,&#13;
US$1.4 million for technical assistance and training, and the remaining US$6.5 million would be&#13;
devoted to recurrent costs. Total costs, considering physical and price contingencies, amount to&#13;
US$9.6 million, including US$0.5 million of taxes. The Bank would finance an estimated&#13;
US$6.1 million of this total cost, and the provincial Government the remaining US$3.5 million.&#13;
7.10 Benefits and Implementation. The subproject has an estimated IERR of almost 34%,&#13;
reflecting the reduction in production costs, and the increase in volume and value of wool and&#13;
sheepmeat production. The NPV of net benefits would total US$9.5 million over a 20-year&#13;
period (at 12% annual discount rate). Subproject execution would be done under the overall&#13;
coordination of SENASA, in collaboration with the COPROSAs.&#13;
II. INVESTMENT SUBPROJECTS TO BE FINANCED BY IDB&#13;
The four investment subprojects intended to be financed by the Inter-American Development&#13;
Bank (IDB), three provincial irrigation/drainage subprojects, and one national (agricultural&#13;
information system) are discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                               Annex B&#13;
8 Province of Rio Negro: Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Development in the Upper Rio&#13;
Negro Valley (Baseline Cost-US$48.6 million)&#13;
8.1   Description. The subproject is located in the Northern area of the province. It is placed&#13;
in the General Roca department, and it includes all the irrigated area of the upper Rio Negro&#13;
valley, comprising 5,757 farms (80% under 15 ha) covering 69,525 ha, with 60% under&#13;
production (41,656 ha), and 85% (58,882 ha) with water rights. The valley is 120 km long, and it&#13;
is home to half of Rio Negro's population. Apples and pears are the main production items, and&#13;
horticultural products a distant third.&#13;
8.2   Main Problems. Presently, the area shows lack of adequate production technology. The&#13;
irrigation and drainage systems are characterized by inadequate maintenance, leading to large&#13;
water losses and high water table levels in many areas. This in turn translates into low&#13;
productivity, low quality of produce and low income, which determine the prevalence of low&#13;
technology production systems.&#13;
8.3   Objectives. The main subproject objective is to provide the conditions to start the&#13;
process leading to a competitive and sustainable fruit production system in the longer run. The&#13;
subproject would rehabilitate the existing irrigation and drainage system, improve its performance&#13;
through better operation and maintenance, and facilitate its transfer to users associations in the&#13;
future. Additionally, it would set in motion the process of generation and transfer of new&#13;
production technology, and improve soil and water management and conservation throughout the&#13;
system, as a preparatory step to reconvert production in the valley.&#13;
8.4   Components. The subproject would have three components: (i) Generation and&#13;
Transfer of Technology (cost: US$2.8 million), which would provide users with new production,&#13;
soil and water management, and conservation technology; (ii) Improvement of Irrigation and&#13;
Drainage Systems (cost: US$21.9 million), which would rehabilitate 11.5 km of existing&#13;
drainage, construct 11.5 km of new drains, line 30.7 km of main canal, construct four new&#13;
secondary irrigation canals, and construction 10 km of canals to control flash floods; and&#13;
(iii) Instittional Strengthening (cost: US$5.9 million), to support better subproject&#13;
management.&#13;
8.5   Costs and Financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$48.6 million, of&#13;
which US$26.3 million are for civil works, US$3.8 million for vehicles and equipment,&#13;
US$5.6 million for technical assistance and training, and the remaining US$12.9 million would be&#13;
devoted to recurrent costs. Total costs, considering physical and price contingencies, amount to&#13;
US$55.5 million, including US$7.8 million of taxes. The IDB would finance an estimated&#13;
US$39.5 million of this total cost, and the provincial Government the remaining US$16.0 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -                               Annex B&#13;
8.6   Benefits and Implementation. The subproject has an estimated IERR of almost 25%,&#13;
reflecting the combined effects of reducing the level of the water table, and the promotion of new,&#13;
low-investment irrigation, crop management and marketing organization technologies. The NPV&#13;
of net benefits would total US$47.4 million (over a 20-year period, at a 12% annual discount&#13;
rate).&#13;
8.7   Implementation. Subproject execution would be the responsibility of a foundation&#13;
comprised of the Provincial Water Department (Departamento Provincial de Aguas, DPA), and a&#13;
Regional Forum comprising the Undersecretary of Fruit Culture of the Province, INTA and the&#13;
Beneficiaries.&#13;
9. Province ofNeuquen: Irrigation Rehabilitation in Colonia Centenario&#13;
(Baseline Cost- US$7.6 million)&#13;
Location - Description&#13;
9.1   Description. The subproject is located in the East Central area of the province. It is&#13;
placed in the right margin of the lower Neuquen river, 10 km away from its junction with the&#13;
Limay river, and downstream from the Planicie Banderita - Cerros Colorados hydroelectric dam.&#13;
Colonia Centenario comprises 365 farms that cover approximately 3,500 ha of irrigated land.&#13;
Apples, pears and peaches are the main production items.&#13;
9.2   Main Problems. The area is adjacent to the Alto Valle subproject, and shares most of its&#13;
problems. There is a lack of adequate production technology. Maintenance of the irrigation and&#13;
drainage systems is insufficient, leading to large water losses and high water table levels in many&#13;
areas. This problem is aggravated here, because the operation of the upstream hydroelectric dam&#13;
has modified the flow regime, and raised the water level in the river. Excess moisture has&#13;
determined low productivity, low quality of produce and low income, which perpetuate the&#13;
prevalence of low technology production systems.&#13;
9.3   Objectives. As in Rio Negro, the main subproject objective is to prepare the area so that&#13;
sustainable fruit production systems can be set in place in the longer run. The subproject would&#13;
rehabilitate the existing irrigation and drainage systems, improve their performance through better&#13;
operation and maintenance, and facilitate their transfer to the users. Additionally, it would set in&#13;
motion the process of generation and transfer of new production technology.&#13;
9.4   Components. The subproject would have three components: (i) Generation and&#13;
Transfer of Technology (cost: US$2.2 million), which would provide users with new production,&#13;
soil and water management, and conservation technology; (ii) Improvement of Irrigation and&#13;
Drainage Systems (cost: US$4.5 million), which would rehabilitate 13.4 km of main canal, and&#13;
rehabilitate and deepen the existing drainage network; and (iii) Institutional Strengthening (cost:&#13;
US$0.9 million), to support subproject management.&#13;
&#13;

9.5   Costs and Financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$7.6 million, of&#13;
which US$4.8 million are for civil works, US$0.2 million for vehicles and equipment,&#13;
US$1.2 million for technical assistance and training, and the remaining US$1.4 million would be&#13;
destined for recurrent costs. Total costs, including physical and price contingencies, amount to&#13;
US$8.8 million, including US$ 1.4 million of taxes. The IDB would finance an estimated&#13;
US$6.4 million of this total cost, and the provincial Government the remaining US$2.4 million.&#13;
9.6   Benefits. The subproject has an estimated IERR of 15%, reflecting the combined effect&#13;
of the high water table abatement, and the promotion of new, low investment irrigation, crop&#13;
management and marketing organization technologies. The NPV of net benefits would total&#13;
US$1.3 million (over a 20-year period and at 12 % annual discount rate).&#13;
9.7   Implementation. Subproject execution would be the responsibility of the Ministry of&#13;
Production and Tourism of Neuquen.&#13;
10. Province of Mendoza: Drainage and Irigation Program in Constitucion&#13;
(Baseline Cost- US$7. 6 million)&#13;
10.1  Description. The subproject is located in the Northeastern area of the province. It is&#13;
placed at the Constituci6n basin, in the lower section of the Tunuyan river causeway, and serves&#13;
1,383 farms covering 10,649 ha. This is a highly urbanized area, with a well-developed roadway&#13;
system, encompassing the cities of Junin (population: 28,500 people), and Rivadavia (population:&#13;
47,000 people), which account for 12% of total provincial population.&#13;
10.2  The net area occupied by farms larger than 1 ha in size is 9,389 ha, 83% (7,832 ha) of&#13;
which is under production, 16% (1,469 ha) is abandoned due to low productivity (including&#13;
339 ha due to high water table problems), and 1% (88 ha) is set aside. Most of the irrigated area&#13;
(79%, 6,187 ha) is covered with wine vineyards, while the rest is devoted mainly to fruit&#13;
production (20%, 1,566 ha), and some horticulture (2%, 157 ha). The majority of grapes&#13;
produced now (92%, 5,692 ha ) is a common table wine grape of lesser quality and low yield.&#13;
10.3  The basin is served by the Constituci6n canal, which runs 15 km long, 5% of which&#13;
(0.75 km) is lined. This main canal feeds three secondary canals: Moyano (8.5 km long, unlined),&#13;
Nuevo Retamo (12.9 km long, unlined), and Viejo Retamo (13.7 km long, 20% lined). The poor&#13;
general infrastructure maintenance levels in some areas has resulted in infiltration problems, which&#13;
coupled with the excessive irrigation volumes used by farmers have resulted in drainage problems.&#13;
This in turn has led to high water table and soil salinity levels, reduced yields, larger dependency&#13;
on water pumping from deep wells and higher costs of production.&#13;
10.4  Main Problems. As in the case of the Montecaseros subproject, the main problems&#13;
include: (i) high water losses due to limited lining of main and secondary canals (5% and 8% in&#13;
this case), light textured soils, and type of water supplied (free of sediments that may naturally line&#13;
the canals); (ii) an inadequate water distribution system that supplies large volumes of water in&#13;
short periods of time; (iii) lack of knowledge about crop patterns and real water needs by system&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                                Annex B&#13;
managers, resulting in poor programming of water distribution; (iv) inadequate system&#13;
maintenance (both at the system and the farm level); and (v) high water table levels in areas&#13;
adjacent to the canal, resulting in damages to crops, roads and buildings.&#13;
10.5  Objectives. The main subproject objectives are to improve overall management and&#13;
increase the efficiency of the system through rehabilitation of the main system canal, lining of the&#13;
Viejo Retamo secondary canal, improvement of the drainage system, and users training in better&#13;
irrigation and system management techniques. All this would lead to an average 51% increase in&#13;
net financial income for the 1383 beneficiaries (small, medium and large producers).&#13;
10.6  Components. The subproject would have five components: (i) Improvement of&#13;
Imgation Systems (cost: US$4.6 million), which would line 11.5 km of Viejo Retamo canal,&#13;
improve 2.4 km of Constituci6n canal, install flood control gates at the junctions of the&#13;
Constituci6n canal and the three secondary canals it feeds, install 70 gauges to regulate flow into&#13;
the tertiary system, and install 1600 water intakes to regulate flow to 100 I/s at farm level; (ii)&#13;
Improvement of Drainage Systems (cost: US$1.4 million), which would rehabilitate 11.5 km of&#13;
the existing drainage network, and construct 1 1.5 km of new drains; (iii) Agricultural Research&#13;
(cost: US$0.4 million) which would develop an agricultural research program (support&#13;
agricultural research conducted through INTA to increase agricultural productivity, especially for&#13;
fruit crops; and (iv) Agricultural Extension (cost: US$0.8 million), which would develop an&#13;
agricultural extension program (support agricultural extension, transfer technologies and promote&#13;
producer organizations for small farmers); and (v) Water Management Training (cost: US$0.3&#13;
million) which would train users to better manage water resources and maintain canals.&#13;
10.7  Costs and Financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$7.5 million, of&#13;
which US$6.0 million are for civil works, US$1.4 million for technical assistance and training, and&#13;
the remaining US$0. 1 million would be destined for recurrent costs. Total costs, considering&#13;
physical and price contingencies, amount to US$ 8.7 million, including US$1.4 million of taxes.&#13;
The IDB would finance an estimated US$7.2 million of this total cost, and the provincial&#13;
Government the remaining US$1.5 million.&#13;
10.8  Benefits. Over 1,380 producers would benefit directly from the subproject, which has an&#13;
estimated IERR of 19%, and a NPV of net benefits of US$7.6 million (over a 20-year period at&#13;
12% annual discount rate).&#13;
10.9  Implementation. Subproject execution would be the sole responsibility of the provincial&#13;
irrigation authority, the Irrigation General Department (Departamento General de Irrigacion,&#13;
DGI), the current administrator of the irrigation system. The direct beneficiaries would reimburse&#13;
about 60 percent of investment costs through an annual quota. In addition, users would be&#13;
expected to pay full operation and maintenance costs through user tariffs.&#13;

11. Argentina: National Agricultural Information System&#13;
(Baseline Cost-US$21.8 million)&#13;
11.1  Description. This is the only nationwide subproject in the first group of subprojects&#13;
covered by the Project. It is an information system subproject designed to improve the availability&#13;
of agriculture related information. The information component would cover the creation of an&#13;
information network, a survey system, an agro-meteorological system, a remote sensing system,&#13;
and a geographical information system.&#13;
11.2 Main Problems. At present, SAGPyA branches work independently and without&#13;
coordination, generating inefficiencies and shortcomings in the generation of basic agricultural&#13;
data. This in turn affects the Secretary's ability to design, monitor and evaluate sector policies, as&#13;
well as the decision making process, and the provision of free, uniform public access to&#13;
agricultural sector information. Moreover, this is not fully integrated with the national system&#13;
coordinated by the National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Censos-&#13;
INDEC)&#13;
11.3  Objectives. The main objective is to set in place a national information system that&#13;
improves availability and access to agricultural data, which will strengthen the programming and&#13;
decision making processes in the sector.&#13;
11.4  Components. The information subproject would include four components: (i) Federal&#13;
Information Network (cost: US$15.1 million), composed of a central node and 23 provincial&#13;
units; it would provide the framework for data capturing, processing and sharing on a nationwide&#13;
basis; (ii) National Agricultural Survey System (cost: US$2.7 million), which would set up a&#13;
system in charge of an in depth reformulation of the present National Agricultural Survey;&#13;
(iii) National Agro-meteorological Network (cost: US$ 1.1 million) which would provide the&#13;
basis for agricultural production forecasts; and (iv) Remote Sensing and Geographical&#13;
Information System (cost: US$2.9 million), designed to centralize, integrate, and facilitate access&#13;
to geographical data.&#13;
11.5  Costs and Financing. The subproject baseline costs would total US$21.8 million, of&#13;
which US$0.3 million are for civil works, US$6.9 million for vehicles and equipment,&#13;
US$4.9 million for technical assistance and training, and the remaining US$9.7 million would be&#13;
destined for recurrent costs. Total costs, considering physical and price contingencies, amount to&#13;
US$24.1 million, including US$2.4 million of taxes. The IDB would finance an estimated&#13;
US$14.1 million of this total cost, the Federal Government and additional US$2.4 million, and the&#13;
provincial Government the remaining US$7.6 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                                 Annex B&#13;
11.6  Benefits. The subproject design follows a modular approach that targets maximum cost&#13;
efficiency, while assuring maximum compatibility and versatility to meet differing provincial&#13;
needs. Project benefits would derive from better availability of agricultural data to assist public&#13;
sector decision makers in their policy making endeavors, and from better access to data for&#13;
private sector agents, to assist them in their management and investment decision processes.&#13;
However, economic benefits were not quantified for this subproject.&#13;

PROVINCIAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT BENEFITS AND&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS BY SUBPROJECT&#13;
1. PROVINCE OF BUENOS AIRES: DEVELOPMENT OF THE&#13;
COLORADO RiVER VALLEY SUBPROJECT&#13;
Benefits&#13;
1.1   The combined effect of the proposed components would be to set in motion a&#13;
production and management technology change. This would help producers attain&#13;
adequate levels of income, improve conservation and management of available resources,&#13;
and strengthen their involvement in the operation and improvement of the irrigation&#13;
system.&#13;
1.2   Benefits were calculated as the aggregation of results from eight farm models&#13;
which represent the four main farm types in the region, replicated into two different&#13;
categories depending on whether they would benefit from the pilot canal lining component&#13;
or not. Production levels evolve for each farm type according to the scheduling and&#13;
expected combined impact of the proposed components. Implementation of these&#13;
components determine the availability and adoption rates of new production technology,&#13;
better water availability and water management techniques, and better marketing&#13;
strategies. The streams of subproject costs, plus the streams of costs and benefits for all&#13;
farm models representing 1,373 beneficiary farms were aggregated and discounted in&#13;
order to obtain the net present value (NPV) of the net benefits attributable to the&#13;
subproject.&#13;
1.3   In all, a 136% increase in area under cultivation would take place when the&#13;
subproject is fully implemented. This expansion in area would be complemented by an&#13;
increase in average yields (ranging from a 33% increase in horticulture yields, for farms&#13;
not benefiting from lining of secondary canals, to a 129% increase in cereal crops for&#13;
farms directly benefiting from lining of secondary canals). Lining of secondary canals in&#13;
conjunction with better irrigation system management, would lead to a 45% reduction in&#13;
water costs for those farms included in the pilot lining program.&#13;

2. PROVINCE OF MENDOZA: MONTECASEROS IRRIGATION AND&#13;
DRAINAGE SUBPROJECT&#13;
Benefits&#13;
2.1    The combined effect of the proposed components would reduce water losses and&#13;
increase the efficiency of the system, raise productivity of existing vineyards and orchards,&#13;
and increase the area under production. Productivity increases (6% for grapes, 19% for&#13;
fruit trees) would result from lower water table level and soil salinity, increased water&#13;
availability, increased frequency and efficiency of water delivery, increased technology&#13;
supply, more efficient input use, and better user training in irrigation methods and other&#13;
specialized agricultural practices. In addition, the cost of production would drop due to&#13;
lower pumping requirements.&#13;
2.2    Production would also rise due to the increase in area under production (11%),&#13;
following the larger, more regular water supply, and the recovery of areas now&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -                               Annex E&#13;
unproductive due to water table level problems. Value of production would also increase&#13;
(47%) as a result of a larger area under production with higher priced fine grapes varieties.&#13;
All this would lead to an average 52% increase in net financial income for the 1,279&#13;
beneficiaries (small, medium and large producers).&#13;
2.3    Net benefits were estimated using three different farm models which simulate farm&#13;
development for the main farm types currently in the region. Production levels and&#13;
production values evolve for each farm type in accordance with the scheduling and&#13;
expected combined impact of the proposed components. Implementation of these&#13;
components determine the availability and adoption rates of new production technology,&#13;
better drainage, decreased water losses, and rehabilitation of unproductive areas. Total&#13;
net benefits were obtained by aggregating and discounting the streams of subproject costs,&#13;
and the costs and benefits for all farm models representing 1,279 beneficiary farms.&#13;

3. PROVINCE OF MENDOZA: STRENGTHENING OF TSE PROVINCIAL IRIGATION AND&#13;
DRAINAGE PROGRAM&#13;
Benefits&#13;
3.1    Avoidance of production losses due to unexpected breakages in the system, plus a&#13;
better. overall functioning of the system would be the main benefits. Other non-quantified&#13;
benefits would include improvement of water quality, as well as enhanced awareness of&#13;
environmental issues associated with system management.&#13;
3.2    The benefits quantified cover only those stemming from the proposed activities&#13;
included in the Minor Works component. In this case benefits were calculated as the&#13;
expected difference in repair costs and average income per hectare with and without&#13;
subproject. In the situation with subproject needed repair and maintenance work are&#13;
properly planned and scheduled, disruption of the operation of the system is the least&#13;
possible, and repair costs and negative impact on average income per ha are kept to a&#13;
minimum. In the situation without subproject, repairs are done after breakage of the&#13;
system occurs, thus costs are higher, disruption is considerable and impact on average&#13;
income per ha is significant.&#13;

4. PROVINCE OF SANTA FE: Pozo BORRADO FLOOD CONTROL&#13;
AND DRAINAGE SUBPROJECT&#13;
Benefits&#13;
4.1    The projected works would alleviate the negative economic impact of recurrent&#13;
floods on crop, dairy and livestock production. As added, indirect benefits, more stable&#13;
farm income would promote investment and further economic growth, and better year&#13;
round roads conditions would improve farm life and facilitate management.&#13;
4.2    The benefits were calculated with the assistance of a hydraulic simulation model,&#13;
and three different farm models which represent the prevailing farm types in the area (dairy&#13;
farms in the Western sector of the subproject area, mixed crop and livestock enterprises in&#13;
the Central area, and cow-calf operations of the Eastern lowlands). The hydraulic&#13;
simulation model provided the data to evaluate the difference in drainage system&#13;
performance under different rainfall conditions, with and without the project. With this&#13;
data in hand, the econornic impact of different climatic adversities was assessed for the&#13;
different farm models, and weighted according to their respective probability of&#13;
occurrence.&#13;

Benefits&#13;
5.1    The projected interventions would drastically reduce the possibility of introduction&#13;
of exotic diseases to the area, and support attainment of international sanitary and quality&#13;
standards for regional vegetable products exports, thus expanding marketing opportunities&#13;
and increasing the final value of products.&#13;
5.2    The benefits were calculated using 15 farm models representing the main four farm&#13;
types in each of the provinces in the region. Main benefits are lower costs of production as&#13;
treatments for Fruit Fly are eliminated once the plague is eradicated (US$ 1.2 million&#13;
annual savings for the whole area), increased production (3%) since there are no&#13;
production losses from fruit fly, and from higher average product value as control of Black&#13;
Spot is more efficient, and a larger share of total production can access higher price&#13;
markets. Total net benefits were obtained by aggregating and discounting the streams of&#13;
subproject costs, and the costs and benefits for all farm models representing 1,000 direct&#13;
beneficiary farms&#13;

ANIMAL HEALTH SERVICES IN MESOPOTAMIA&#13;
Benefits&#13;
6.1    The projected interventions would allow a US$ 12 million annual reduction of&#13;
regional livestock production costs (only partially assigned to the project). These savings,&#13;
which start in the second year of the subproject, result from the discontinuation of the&#13;
vaccination requirement against Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD). Benefits of the&#13;
subproject were assigned in proportion to its contribution to the ongoing sanitary&#13;
campaign against FMD. Total net benefits were obtained by aggregating and discounting&#13;
the streams of subproject costs, and the proportion of benefits in cost savings for 72,600&#13;
livestock owners in the region.&#13;
6.2    Additionally, the subproject would establish conditions that may allow&#13;
international recognition of FMD free status, and improved long run marketing&#13;
opportunities for regional animal products exports through access to higher price markets&#13;
(not quantified).&#13;

SERVICES AND CONTROLS IN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA&#13;
Benefits&#13;
7.1    The projected interventions would increase volume and quality of regional wool&#13;
production; improve quality and increase average price level received for wool marketed;&#13;
decrease livestock production costs; ensure regional FMD free status, and thus provide&#13;
improved export marketing opportunities for regional animal products; and increase&#13;
general population welfare through better control of enzootic and zoonotic diseases, and&#13;
quality standards of livestock products consumed.&#13;
7.2    The main benefits for this subproject were calculated as the increase in wool&#13;
production (22%) and sheepmeat production (7% to 33% depending on category)&#13;
following the reduced incidence of mange (from 15% to 2%). Better animal health&#13;
management practices, and better product shearing and conditioning techniques, would&#13;
also improve wool quality and lead to better sale prices (US$ 0.05 per kg). Other&#13;
subproject actions would increase general population welfare through better control and&#13;
reduced incidence of zoonotic diseases. These benefits were quantified as the reduction in&#13;
health care costs, and number of days away from work or with reduced productivity for&#13;
patients afflicted with zoonotic diseases. Finally, by ensuring regional FMD free status,&#13;
the subproject may allow international recognition of FMD free status, and improved long&#13;
run marketing opportunities for regional animal products exports through access to higher&#13;
price markets (not quantified).&#13;

8. PROVINCE OF RiO NEGRO: INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION AND&#13;
DEVELOPMENT OF THE UPPER RIO NEGRO VALLEY SUBPROJECT&#13;
Benefits&#13;
8.1    The combined effect of the proposed components would be to abate the high water&#13;
table level in the area, and to promote new, low investment irrigation, crop management&#13;
and marketing organization technologies. All this would result in an average 219%&#13;
increase in net financial income for approximately 4,380 direct beneficiaries (small and&#13;
medium producers).&#13;
8.2    Benefits were calculated via aggregation of results from 17 different farm models&#13;
which represent the main farm types in the region. Farm models differ in size, type of&#13;
production, technological level, and their access to better input purchase prices and&#13;
product sale prices depending on their degree of vertical integration. Production levels&#13;
and production values evolve for each farm type according to the scheduling and expected&#13;
combined impact of the proposed components. Implementation of these components&#13;
determine the availability and adoption rates of new production technology, better&#13;
drainage, decreased water losses and rehabilitation of unproductive areas (all leading to a&#13;
31% increase in productivity), and better marketing strategies as a result of better product&#13;
quality and larger quantities (leading to an average 12% increase in farm gate prices).&#13;

9. PROVINCE OF NEUQUEN: IRRIGATION REHABILITATION IN&#13;
COLONIA CENTENARIO SUBPROJECT&#13;
Benefits&#13;
9.1    The combined effect of the proposed components would be to abate the high water&#13;
table level in the area, and to promote new, low investment irrigation, crop management&#13;
and marketing organization technologies. All this would lead to an average 179%&#13;
increase in net financial income for the 365 beneficiaries (small and medium producers).&#13;
9.2    The benefits were calculated as the aggregation of results from 10 different farm&#13;
models which represent the main farm types in the region. Due to the proximity and&#13;
production similarities to the Rio Negro Valley, farm models are very similar to those&#13;
utilized in that project.&#13;
9.3    As in the case of Rio Negro, farm models differ in size, type of production,&#13;
technological level, and their access to better input purchase prices and product sale prices&#13;
depending on their degree of vertical integration. Production levels and production values&#13;
evolve for each farm type according to the scheduling and expected combined impact of&#13;
the proposed components. Implementation of these components determine the availability&#13;
and adoption rates of new production technology, better drainage, decreased water losses&#13;
and rehabilitation of unproductive areas (all leading to a 39% increase in productivity),&#13;
and better marketing strategies as a result of better product quality and larger quantities&#13;
(leading to an average 11% increase in farm gate prices).&#13;

10. PROVINCE OF MENDOZA: CONSTITUCI6N IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE&#13;
REHABILITATION SUBPROJECT&#13;
Benefits&#13;
10.1   The combined effect of the proposed components would reduce water losses,&#13;
increase the efficiency of the system, increase productivity, and increase the area under&#13;
production. Productivity increases (5% for grapes, 19% for fruit trees) would result from&#13;
lower water table level and soil salinity, increased water availability, increased frequency&#13;
and efficiency of water delivery, increased technology supply, more efficient input use, and&#13;
better user training in irrigation methods and other specialized agricultural practices. In&#13;
addition, cost of production would drop due to lower pumping requirements.&#13;
10.2   Production would also rise due to the increase in area under production (14%),&#13;
following the larger, more regular water supply, and the recovery of areas now&#13;
unproductive due to water table level problems. The larger value of production (49%)&#13;
would result in part from an increase in area under production with higher priced fine&#13;
grapes varieties. All this would lead to an average 51% increase in net financial income&#13;
for the 1,383 beneficiaries (small, medium and large producers).&#13;

results from three different farm models which portray the prevailing farm types in the&#13;
region. Production levels and production values evolve for each farrn type in accordance&#13;
with the scheduling and expected combined impact of the proposed components.&#13;
Implementation of these- components determine the availability and adoption rates of new&#13;
production technology, better drainage, decreased water losses, rehabilitation of&#13;
unproductive areas, etc. Total net benefits were obtained by aggregating and discounting&#13;
the streams of subproject costs, and the costs and benefits for all farm models representing&#13;
1,383 beneficiary farms.&#13;

11. NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SUBPROJECT&#13;
Benefits&#13;
11.1   The subproject design follows a modular approach that targets maximum cost&#13;
efficiency, while assuring maximum compatibility, and versatility to meet differing&#13;
provincial needs. Project benefits would derive from better availability of agricultural data&#13;
to assist public sector decision makers in their policy making endeavors, and from better&#13;
access to data for private sector agents, to assist them in their management and investment&#13;
decision processes. Because of the difficulties of quantifying such benefits, however,&#13;
economic benefits were not estimated for this subproject.&#13;

12. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT&#13;
12.1   The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the project was calculated based&#13;
on the streams of estimated benefits and costs for eleven appraised subprojects included in&#13;
the first group of proposed initiatives (Group A), plus costs of the institutional&#13;
development and coordination and management components (at both national and&#13;
provincial levels) and other administrative costs (IDB's PPF repayment, inspection and&#13;
monitoring). The sample of subprojects and components evaluated represents 62.5% of&#13;
total baseline project cost. The overall IERR for this first phase of the project is 22.2%.&#13;
Assuming that the group of subprojects in the next phase is similar to those included in the&#13;
first phase, the stated first-phase IERR should be a conservative estimate of the overall&#13;
IERR. This follows from the fact that all the project implementation support components&#13;
costs were already accounted for in the calculation of the IERR for the first phase.&#13;
12.2   The following Table E. 1 summarizes the estimated subprojects IERRs, and the&#13;
calculated overall IERR for the first phase of the program:&#13;

ARGENTINA&#13;
PROVINCIAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
The Project&#13;
1.    The Provincial Agricultural Development Project (Programa de Servicios&#13;
Agricolas Provinciales, PROSAP), as part of the process of the modernization and&#13;
decentralization of the State, has been designed to improve the delivery of essential&#13;
services to the agricultural sector at the provincial level and improve productive rural&#13;
infrastructure, in order to achieve sustainable development. PROSAP's main objectives&#13;
are to expand agricultural production, increase and stabilize farmers' incomes, and&#13;
increase international competitiveness.&#13;
2.    The project has been designed to promote economnic growth in the agricultural&#13;
sector, improving the competitive position of exports and increasing incomes by&#13;
supporting: (i) rural infrastructure initiatives; (ii) improved provincial agricultural support&#13;
services; (iii) introduction of productive and cost-effective technologies; (iv) strengthening&#13;
of provincial institutional capacity to identify, prepare and implement investment projects;&#13;
and (v) an expanded private sector role (e.g. farmers' organizations, NGOs, and services&#13;
providers) in sector development.&#13;
Subproject Selection Criteria&#13;
3.    The process begins when provinces submit subproject proposals, consistent with&#13;
their priorities, development strategies and investment plans. The selection of these&#13;
subprojects is based on technical and institutional feasibility, financial sustainability,&#13;
estimated rate of return, expected socioeconomic and environmental impacts, beneficiaries'&#13;
participation and commitment, and complementarity with private sector initiatives. To&#13;
facilitate project start-up, a set of 11 priority subprojects (Group "A") was defined, whose&#13;
feasibility studies and engineering designs were ready by appraisal, representing more than&#13;
50% of total project costs.&#13;
4.    PROSAP promotes the presentation of subprojects in the following areas:&#13;
(i) rehabilitation, modernization or improvement of rural infrastructure (irrigation, flood&#13;
control and drainage, feeder roads, rural electrification); (ii) establishment of watershed&#13;
management and natural resources conservation systems; (iii) improvement in the delivery&#13;
of provincial support services for the generation and transfer of technology, production&#13;
diversification, export promotion and quality control, animal health and plant protection&#13;
services, and provision of basic statistical and geographical information; and&#13;
(iv) establishment of new arrangements for the provision of support services, integrating&#13;
the private sector's organizations and gradually sharing financial and technical&#13;
responsibilities to increase long-term sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -                            Annex F&#13;
5.    The basic environmental eligibility criteria of PROSAP are that subprojects&#13;
improve environmental conditions, either by reducing or controlling past damages or by&#13;
initiating practices that have beneficial effects on biophysical and socioeconomic&#13;
surroundings. Additionally, potential adverse effects need to be anticipated and their&#13;
impacts mitigated by the corresponding environmental action plan. The eligibility criteria&#13;
would exclude any subproject proposal based on the expansion of the agricultural frontier&#13;
at the expense of natural forests or promoting the conversion of wild lands to agriculture.&#13;
The increase in area under cultivation would be produced by intensification of the use of&#13;
agricultural land, which is land classified as capable of being used intensively for&#13;
agriculture and that has been cultivated before. The project would help remove some of&#13;
the constraints (scarce water for irrigation, poor drainage and salinization in sections of&#13;
the potentially irrigated area, low productivity due to diseases and poor cultural practices,&#13;
varieties not adapted to market requirements, etc.) that are presently limiting the area&#13;
actually being used for agricultural productive purposes in the same period.&#13;
6.    The above environmental eligibility criteria have been established for several&#13;
reasons: (i) agricultural lands currently used have a significant deficit of infrastructure and&#13;
public services, due to lack of investments during the last few decades; (ii) land use can be&#13;
intensified by improved technologies, services and the rehabilitation of productive&#13;
infrastructure; and (iii) under current available technology, there is no comparative&#13;
advantage to start using lands which have not been under exploitation already.&#13;
Environmental Screening&#13;
7.    The Environmental Unit (UnidadAmbiental, UA), within the Project's Central&#13;
Coordination and Management Unit (UnidadEjecutura Central, UEC), would screen&#13;
subproject proposals for their potential environmental impact and supervise the&#13;
environmental specialists within the provincial project implementing units. The UA would&#13;
ensure that the environmental screening procedures, impact assessments and corrective&#13;
measures, as outlined in the Projects Environmental Manual (Manual Ambiental, MA) are&#13;
properly carried out at every relevant project phase and at all levels of project&#13;
administration. In addition, the UA would provide technical assistance and training at the&#13;
provincial level, to strengthen local institutional capacity to design and implement&#13;
environmentally sound subprojects.&#13;
8.    Environmental screening procedures shall be applied to all subproject proposals&#13;
presented by the provinces (see Table 1). This procedure is initiated with the preparation&#13;
of an Environmental Profile which includes a subproject summary, relevant environmental&#13;
legislation, identification of potential impact, a preliminary subproject classification&#13;
(according to the Bank's classification) and identification of required studies. Because of&#13;
the nature of the project, almost all individual subprojects in the future are expected to fall&#13;
under either environmental classification B, which requires an Environmental Analysis&#13;
(EA), or C, which does not. Projects classified as either A or B shall prepare an&#13;
environmental impact assessment, which upon preliminary revision by PROSAP and a&#13;
public consultation process, shall be drafted in final form, incorporating the results of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 143 -                                             Annex F&#13;
consultation. During implementation, each subproject would be closely monitored and&#13;
recommended mitigation plans executed. To facilitate the EA and subprojects screening,&#13;
the Project Preparation Unit has drafted Guidelines for Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessments and Environmental Analysis (a chapter in the Project Environmental&#13;
Manual), incorporating the national and provincial environmental stipulations regarding&#13;
impact assessments at different stages during the subproject cycle.&#13;

Environmental Analysis for Priority Subprojects in Group A&#13;
9.       Based on the existence of a subproject considered to have potential negative&#13;
impacts (i.e., Pozo Borrado-Province of Santa Fe), it has been decided to classify the&#13;
PROSAP Project as Environmental Category A. Therefore, for all subprojects in the&#13;
priority Group A, detailed environmental analyses were conducted to evaluate their&#13;
potential environmental impacts and, when needed, recommend mitigation actions. The&#13;
recommended mitigation actions, along with their associated costs, were incorporated into&#13;
the Group A subprojects' design. The studies concluded that, on the whole, the&#13;
subprojects would have significant positive environmental impacts, including: (i) reduced&#13;
salinization; (ii) decreased soil erosion; (iii) increased crop diversification; (iv) better&#13;
animal husbandry practices; (v) improved natural resource conservation; (vi) reduced&#13;
application of agro-chemicals; and (vii) more sanitary consumer health conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -                           Annex F&#13;
10.   However, the studies identified four areas of intervention, which, without&#13;
appropriate mitigation measures, could have potential negative environmental impacts.&#13;
These were: (i) water resource management; (ii) crop pest management; (iii) livestock&#13;
health management; and (iv) basic infrastructure.&#13;
I1.   Water Resource Management These subprojects would improve and rehabilitate&#13;
existing irrigation and drainage systems, as well as expand drainage works. To improve or&#13;
rehabilitate soil conditions, the project would construct drainage works. PROSAP would&#13;
not consider subproject proposals which would open up new areas of cultivation. Water&#13;
management subprojects would include the following components having positive&#13;
environmental impacts: (i) an institutional strengthening for the efficient water&#13;
management, including environmental impact evaluation; (ii) investments to restore&#13;
salinized soils or elevated water tables, and control of the factors which contribute to these&#13;
negative processes, including measures to encourage rational water use and infrastructure&#13;
maintenance; (iii) development and transfer of technologies for better water management;&#13;
and (iv) water and soil management training for extension workers and producers.&#13;
12.   Nevertheless, such interventions, by encouraging agricultural expansion or&#13;
intensification, could increase soil exhaustion or erosion, pollution, arising from greater&#13;
application of agrochemicals, and water nutrient levels, resulting in aquatic weed&#13;
proliferation and eutrophication in downstream lakes and dams.&#13;
13.   Appropriate mitigation measures to be included in subproject design are:&#13;
(i) promotion of cultural practices for proper agrochemical use, including integrated pest&#13;
management and alternative, less harmful products; training and education programs for&#13;
professionals, technicians and producers, covering health and environmental risks&#13;
associated with agrochemicals, as well as proper practices; (ii) data collection (river and&#13;
canal flow, rainfall, water table level, meteorological information); (iii) periodic sampling&#13;
of water and soil salinity; in addition, sampling of water for content of pesticides,&#13;
fertilizers and pathogens; (iv) inventory and analysis of pests and invading weeds&#13;
transported by canals; (v) adoption of tolerance levels and standards of water quality, and&#13;
determination of control measures; (vi) preparation and introduction of norms and&#13;
procedures for the control of agrochemicals, pests, diseases and invading weeds,&#13;
transported by water; (vii) elaboration of regulations for works affecting drainage; and&#13;
(viii) elaboration of norms and procedures for the management and conservation of natural&#13;
areas affected by the project and their wildlife; creation of reserves and protected areas.&#13;
14.   In the case of the Flood Control and Drainage Subproject in Pozo Borrado, in&#13;
addition to the environmental analysis mentioned above, additional studies on the&#13;
biological diversity of the eastern part of the project area and the potential environmental&#13;
impacts on the flora and fauna of the regional wetlands would be carried out. Once the&#13;
results of this study are ready, the first and second EIA report should be subject to a new&#13;
consultation process. Completion of this study and incorporation of new mitigation&#13;
measures required, including the strengthening and/or creation of protected areas would&#13;
be conditions for Bank's approval of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement for this subproject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -                           Annex F&#13;
between the Federal Government and the Santa Fe Province and, therefore, for the&#13;
disbursement of funds under this subloan.&#13;
15.   Crop Pest Management. The most serious environmental impacts could be:&#13;
(i) an increase in the level of toxic substances in the environment, especially in natural&#13;
water bodies; (ii) greater risk to the health and safety of producers of intoxication; and&#13;
(iii) the risks inherent in the use of biological control. To ensure the safety of farmers, as&#13;
well as to minimize potential environmental effects, the subprojects would adhere to strict&#13;
health and safety standards, establish monitoring plans and controls, and conduct&#13;
appropriate training in the use of the techniques and products involved, and the promotion&#13;
of integrated pest management practices. The training events will be carried out following&#13;
strict safety standards and using adequate protective equipment to avoid accidents. The&#13;
educational level and language of farmers will be fully taken into account for the&#13;
preparation of training materials to be distributed among beneficiaries.&#13;
16.   The Crop Pest Management Services in Northwest Argentina, the only Group A&#13;
subproject of this nature, includes the following mitigation measures: (i) application&#13;
methods were carefully designed based on a determination of adequate time, frequency,&#13;
doses and treatment for specific insects; methods and equipment which reduced risks were&#13;
selected; (ii) continuous surveillance of applications doses and frequency,&#13;
(iii) enforcement of safety norms, including proper washing and storing of equipment;&#13;
(iv) definition of procedures and contingency plans for cases of poisoning from&#13;
agrochemicals; (v) safety controls for agrochemicals, including in marketing, transport&#13;
and storage, as well as container disposal through programs which support recycling of&#13;
containers by manufacturer; (vi) design and implement emergency procedures for cases of&#13;
pesticide spills or poisoning; (vii) training and education for inspectors, producers and&#13;
farm workers in monitoring, control and emergencies; (viii) education campaigns on&#13;
agrochemicals and their use among the population of the region; and (ix) monitoring the&#13;
effectiveness of the safety procedures and health standards and proper recording of&#13;
accidents.&#13;
17.   Livestock Health Management Subprojects in this area of intervention would&#13;
have positive or neutral environmental impacts. Their primary component is the&#13;
vaccination against Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD), which poses no environmental risk.&#13;
The establishment of quarantined areas and controls would block the introduction and&#13;
spread of disease, as well as allow for a better control of transport and commerce of&#13;
livestock. These subprojects, by controlling and preventing disease, would improve the&#13;
quality of meat products.&#13;
18.   Nevertheless, other chemicals needed to control livestock diseases could: (i) pose&#13;
health and safety problems to individuals handling and applying them; (ii) contaminate soil&#13;
and water; and (iii) harm wildlife, including beneficial organisms. Therefore, the following&#13;
specific mitigation measures are recommended the design and implementation of:&#13;
(i) environmental standards, and monitoring and control activities; (ii) training programs&#13;
for professionals, technicians and workers concerning environmental and health risks; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -                           Annex F&#13;
(iii) training and education programs to introduce integrated pest management practices&#13;
and use of alternative, less harmful, products when possible.&#13;
19.   Basic Infrastructure As these subprojects would improve existing roads and&#13;
expand existing electrification systems and would not open up new areas of cultivation,&#13;
they are not expected to affect the environment in a significant way. Nevertheless, care&#13;
would be required to ensure the protection of wildlife and their habitat, and monitor the&#13;
environmental impacts of possible changes in production patterns. Principal mitigation&#13;
measures to be applied in rural road rehabilitation investments are: (i) modification and/or&#13;
construction of structures for the adequate evacuation of excess surface waters;&#13;
(ii) protection of roads against floods; (iii) protection of sites of special cultural, historical&#13;
or aesthetic value; and (iv) training and education of members of user's cooperatives in&#13;
environmental protection.&#13;
20.   In rural electrification projects, the main mitigation measures contemplated are:&#13;
(i) adoption of adequate procedures for the selection of electrification routes and&#13;
deforestation; (ii) protection of sites of particular cultural, historical or aesthetic value,&#13;
and/or species of special genetic or ecological value; and (iii) environmental education for&#13;
users and providers of the electrical service.&#13;
Further Mitigation Measures&#13;
21.   All PROSAP subprojects would be based upon the principle of sustainable&#13;
development, watershed management and integrated pest management. The&#13;
environmental problems, currently affecting the project areas, as well as those which could&#13;
result from the subprojects, arising from the intensification of land use and pesticide&#13;
application, would be addressed within the framework of those fundamental concepts.&#13;
The identification of mitigation actions, discussed above, does not exclude the possibility&#13;
of the need for additional measures specific to each case and area of intervention.&#13;
Mitigation of negative environmental impacts of projects would be undertaken, to the&#13;
maximum extent possible at the subproject design stage, but as the result of continuous&#13;
subproject environmental surveillance, subprojects would be adjusted throughout the life&#13;
of the project, as required.&#13;
22.   As has been mentioned, the Borrower has presented draft environmental analyses&#13;
for each individual subproject included in Group A, as well as an environmental report for&#13;
the whole project. These documents are currently being reviewed by the Bank. The&#13;
Appraisal Mission examined the effectiveness of PROSAP's subproject environmental&#13;
screening procedures, and the monitoring and impact evaluation systems to ensure&#13;
compliance with environmental guidelines and procedures. In addition, the Mission&#13;
evaluated the adequacy of the mitigation measures incorporated into the project design&#13;
and presented recommendations for revision either of the individual environmental&#13;
analyses, the design of each of these investment subprojects, or the institutional&#13;
arrangements defined for their implementation.&#13;

BENEFICIARY PARTICIPATION&#13;
A. PROJECT CONTEXT&#13;
1.    The rural population in Argentina12 represented less than 13% of the total&#13;
population, or around 4.3 million people, in 1991. Census figures indicate that rural&#13;
population has been declining steadily during the past three decades as a result of the&#13;
complex transformations of the agricultural sector and the increasing social mobility and&#13;
job opportunities available in the urban areas. Most of the rural population is scattered&#13;
throughout the countryside; however, there are significant regional differences. While&#13;
almost 50% of the total rural population is concentrated in the 'Regi6n Pampeana', the&#13;
Northeast and Northwest provinces have the highest proportion of rural population (see&#13;
Table 1).&#13;

2.     The uneven distribution of the population reflects the heterogeneity of the&#13;
agricultural sector in Argentina. Large differences exists between regions regarding farm&#13;
structure, production systems, resources allocation, and the competitiveness of the&#13;
different types of agricultural producers. While the agricultural sector in the Regi6n&#13;
Pampeana continues to be dominated by large farms; small farms, mostly poor, are&#13;
concentrated in northeast and northwest regions. More than half of the total number of&#13;
small farmers in the country (estimated in 200,000) are in these areas. The problem of&#13;
12For census purposes, rural population is defined as the population living in the countryside or in towns&#13;
with less than 2,000 inhabitants.&#13;

- 148 -                                 Annex G&#13;
regional economic disparity and uneven performance of the agricultural sector is a critical&#13;
policy challenge. According to the National Statistics Institute (INDEC) about 34%&#13;
percent of the rural population, or 1.5 million people is poor (see Table 2)'3. Incidence of&#13;
poverty is higher in the northern provinces. More than 50% of the rural population in the&#13;
NEA and NOA provinces is poor, that is twice as much than in the Regi6n Pampeana.&#13;

3.     Extensive cultivation, relatively low efficiency added to little public and private&#13;
investment have resulted in an increasingly poor agricultural performance, particularly in&#13;
some sub-sectors, such as fruit production, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane. The&#13;
deterioration of public services has contributed to a loss of sectoral competitiveness. To&#13;
increase overall competitiveness, the sector requires investment for its modernization and&#13;
restructuring. Central to this process is the decentralization of the public sector, the&#13;
development of appropriated support services, and the transfer of certain services to the&#13;
private sector where possible.&#13;
4.     The long-term perspectives for the agricultural sector are promising. The new&#13;
macroeconomic framework and the conditions created by the market liberalization (GATT&#13;
and MERCOSUR), provide a crucial incentive for increasing sectoral productivity.&#13;
However, the impacts of these policies would not be homogeneous among regions and&#13;
producers. To ensure the effects of these macroeconomic policy changes would have a&#13;
positive impact on the regional economies, sectoral policy should focus on the reduction&#13;
of these dualities of scale and location.&#13;
5.     A key instrument to increase the competitiveness of the sector is the rehabilitation&#13;
and modernization of irrigation infrastructure and the decentralization of water&#13;
management systems. In some provinces, such as Mendoza, the system is decentralized&#13;
13 INDEC's estimate of poverty is based on an index of unsatisfied basic needs build upon the 1991&#13;
population census information on housing, education, employment and, sanitation.&#13;

and the management of the secondary and tertiary network is administered by the users. In&#13;
other provinces, irrigation systems are administered by a central agency with almost no&#13;
participation of the users. In most provinces there is little experience with decentralized&#13;
systems, and water user associations are rather weak and unskilled. Sharp differences&#13;
exist between associations regarding size, composition, institutional arrangements and&#13;
participation levels, among others. All these factors influence the effectiveness of the&#13;
associations and their participation in the management of the irrigation systems.&#13;
B. KEY CONSTRAINTS AND SOLUTIONS&#13;
6.     For a successful decentralization and modernization of services, beneficiary&#13;
participation and solid producer associations are required.. Beneficiary participation is a&#13;
crucial factor for project success and sustainability. A review of selected Bank projects&#13;
reveals a strong association between participation and project effectiveness'4.&#13;
Participation prompts the development of beneficiary ownership and increases the&#13;
responsibility of the intended beneficiaries on project implementation. Participation builds&#13;
skills and strengthens institutional effectiveness because it contributes to more&#13;
transparency and better use of existing resources.&#13;
7.     To ensure beneficiary involvement during project preparation, a systematic&#13;
stakeholder consultation was implemented to analyze and discuss specific mechanisms for&#13;
beneficiary participation. In addition to the consultation, an organizational diagnosis was&#13;
carried out to explore how the project could strengthen water user associations and&#13;
beneficiary participation during implementation'5. The main goal was to provide essential&#13;
information for designing specific procedures for beneficiary participation as well as&#13;
mechanisms to strengthen the organizational and managerial skills of water user&#13;
associations for administrating the irrigation systems.&#13;
8.     Cases from five provinces (Buenos Aires, Mendoza, Neuquen, Rio Negro and&#13;
Salta) with different agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions were selected for the&#13;
studies. The overall objectives of both studies were to establish a feedback between the&#13;
project team and the beneficiaries and to develop an appropriate framework for their&#13;
participation during project implementation. Workshops and focus groups with main&#13;
stakeholders and in-depth interviews with key informants were held in the provinces.&#13;
14 It has been observed that beneficiary participation allows a better definition of project components&#13;
and activities because it ensures that beneficiaries' objectives and priorities are properly considered in&#13;
project preparation and implementation. For more information see The World Bank Participation&#13;
Sourcebook (The World Bank 1996).&#13;
5 The studies were partially funded by a grant from the Fund for Innovative Approaches in Human and&#13;
Social Development (FIAHS). Two local consultants carried out the field work with the assistance of&#13;
the Project Preparation Unit between May and September, 1995.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150 -                           Annex G&#13;
Client Consultation&#13;
9.    A systematic client consultation with water users associations and other key&#13;
stakeholders, including state officials from the central water management agency (Water&#13;
State Society), provincial level agencies (Water Directorates), and inter-state water&#13;
agencies (Watershed Authorities) was implemented. The consultation focused on the&#13;
following issues: (i) users' priorities; (ii) perceptions of key problems and potentialities for&#13;
transferring management to the users; (iii) a framework for beneficiary participation; and&#13;
(iv) requirements for strengthening beneficiary organizations.&#13;
Organizational Diagnosis&#13;
10.   To assess, from the users' perspective, the organizational weaknesses and potential&#13;
of their associations to manage decentralized irrigation systems, an organizational&#13;
diagnosis was carried out. Its objective was to identify with the water user associations&#13;
alternative ways to strengthen their organizations and to improve the transition toward&#13;
decentralized water management systems. The organizational diagnosis followed a&#13;
client-oriented methodology, trying to bridge the gap between the goals of the users and&#13;
the proposed institutional structure for the management of the irrigation systems. The&#13;
assessment focused on the following issues: (i) external and internal constraints to&#13;
organizational effectiveness; (ii) identification of the conditions that can be changed most&#13;
readily; and (iii) ways to change those conditions and to improve the organizational&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
Main Results&#13;
11.   The results of the studies provided valuable inputs to the definition of operational&#13;
issues, such as institutional arrangements, mechanisms and activities for strengthening&#13;
beneficiary participation, consultation and dissemination strategies, and criteria and&#13;
procedures to assess potential social impacts of the projects.&#13;
12.   Small-producer organizations tend to be weak. Most of them lack organizational&#13;
and managerial skills, and they control little resources. Membership is reduced and&#13;
producers do not perceive clear benefits from participating. That is the case of most water&#13;
user associations (WUA), particularly in provinces where water management system are&#13;
centralized. There is a general mistrust of central water management agencies among&#13;
producers. WUA are not perceived as autonomous organizations by the producers given&#13;
their weak functions, little autonomy, and unclear demarcation among state and WUA&#13;
functions. It is important to indicate that in most cases where services have been&#13;
decentralized, the system operates efficiently and users are satisfied with the services&#13;
provided. Nevertheless, participation in the WUA, measured as meetings attendance and&#13;
voting, is low. Even in decentralized systems, producers believe their participation would&#13;
have little impact on the management of the irrigation systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -                           Annex G&#13;
13.   Another issue highlighted by the consultation and organizational diagnosis is that&#13;
producers perceive that key policy and management decisions that directly affect them are&#13;
taken without consulting them. Producers think there is a lack of information and no clear&#13;
mechanisms for their participation in the decision making process. Regarding PROSAP,&#13;
producers felt that, until the consultation, they had insufficient information about the&#13;
project and little participation during the initial formulation stage.&#13;
Key Problems and Alternatives&#13;
14.   The consultation showed that while representatives from government agencies and&#13;
WUA have similar assessments of the limitations and potential for increasing beneficiary&#13;
participation and decentralizing the irrigation systems, they have different priorities&#13;
regarding the proposed solutions. The key problems identified by the WUA and state&#13;
officials can be grouped into three main categories: (i) Social; (ii) Technical; and&#13;
(iii) Economic-financial. Among the social problems, the most important are the weakness&#13;
and lack of managerial skills of the WUA, the heterogeneity of producers, and the lack of&#13;
participation. Among the technical problems, inappropriate infrastructure, existing&#13;
technical inefficiencies and lack of technical skills are highlighted. The major&#13;
economic-financial limitations mentioned are the repayment capacity of the producers, the&#13;
amount of the proposed investments, and the lack of resources required to carry out the&#13;
decentralization of services to the producers. Table 3 shows the main results of the client&#13;
consultation.&#13;
15.   Economic-financial problems and related technical-productive constraints are the&#13;
most frequently mentioned in a number of ways. Solving the indebtedness problem and&#13;
the lack of financing are considered by producers and government officials (see table&#13;
above) as a necessary condition for project implementation and, particularly for&#13;
transferring the water management systems to the users. Similarly, the lack of technical&#13;
assistance is perceived as a key bottleneck for improving the management of the systems&#13;
and the competitiveness of the producers. Although stakeholders agree that the project&#13;
provides sound technical solutions to the problems identified, producers are concerned&#13;
with their capacity to repay. There is a growing concern regarding the cost of the project&#13;
vis-a-vis a the crisis that small and medium producers face. All this was configuring for&#13;
the producers an uncertain and risky panorama as compared to the commitments that the&#13;
project implies. Producers believed the resolution to their financial and economic&#13;
problems is out of their reach and in the hands of the provincial and national government.&#13;
Also, this uncertainty panorama was fed by the poor information available and lack of&#13;
participation during the initial stages of project preparation.&#13;
16.   Finally, both beneficiaries and government officials signaled out that the existing&#13;
legislation has certain restrictions that hinder further development of the WUA. In this&#13;
regard, two main issues need to be addressed in the future. First, greater autonomy has to&#13;
be granted to the WUA to ensure they would have the power to enforce regulations&#13;
regarding recovery of fees, alternative water uses and conflict resolution, among others.&#13;

Second, to ensure a more efficient water use, a volumetric-based tariff system would be&#13;
required.&#13;

17.   The key problems that beneficiaries and government officials consider essential for&#13;
a successful project implementation are improving beneficiary participation and&#13;
strengthening producer associations, particularly developing the organizational, technical&#13;
and managerial skills of the WUA. The crucial challenges that emerges from the&#13;
consultation is to develop confidence, credibility and commitment on the producers.&#13;
Increasing consultation and participation during implementation is perceived by the&#13;
stakeholders as the only possibility to influence and have increasing control over project&#13;
activities.&#13;
C. IMPLEMENTING PARTICIPATION AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
Potentialities&#13;
18.   Parallel to the problems above mentioned, there are important social/institutional&#13;
variables that could facilitate project implementation. The desire for participation, and&#13;
dynamism of the producers are positive factors that would facilitate the transition toward&#13;
decentralized management systems. Increasing responsibility and participation in the&#13;
management of the irrigation systems is generally perceived by farmers as a priority for&#13;
improving overall efficiency in the operation of the systems and increasing&#13;
competitiveness.&#13;
19.   Producers are aware of the risks and costs that the decentralization would imply,&#13;
and they are willing to take those risks and to pay for a better service. In this regard, the&#13;
existing experience of the WUA in Mendoza and Rio Colorado, with the recovery of user&#13;
fees and the maintenance of secondary and tertiary irrigation networks, represents an&#13;
important asset to build upon.&#13;
20.   The institutional flexibility of the WUA is another asset that would help to respond&#13;
swiftly to operational/technical and administrative problems. Producer associations are&#13;
closer than provincial government agencies to the users. Producers identify themselves&#13;
with their associations and are willing to grant them with the power to enforce and&#13;
sanction administrative rules. The normative flexibility of the associations also facilitates&#13;
the development of irrigation management systems appropriated to the productive&#13;
activities of the users.&#13;
21.   Regarding the issue of organizational and administrative flexibility, the&#13;
organizational diagnosis showed that more homogeneous associations are better&#13;
managers. To optimize the use of existing infrastructure and resources and to increase the&#13;
institutional effectiveness of the associations, it would be recommended to encourage the&#13;
formation of homogeneous WUA. This could be accomplished by the organization of&#13;
smaller -more homogeneous- associations and their federation into larger associations that&#13;
would benefit from the scale of the operation, while maintaining the flexibility and&#13;
openness for beneficiary participation found in small organizations. According to the&#13;
diagnosis, the optimum number of producers to draw community support and to facilitate&#13;
decision-making that an association can manage, fluctuates between 25 and 40 producers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154 -                           Annex G&#13;
with an irrigated area between 400-600 ha. These numbers change across different&#13;
regions and production systems. In some cases, where producers are more homogeneous&#13;
and better organized, the number of producers and areas managed by an association could&#13;
be increased, such as in Mendoza. However, to facilitate the transition in areas with less&#13;
organizational experience, the scale problem should be taken into consideration when&#13;
planning the transfer to the WUA.&#13;
Project Design and Implementation&#13;
22.   The participation process triggered by the organizational diagnosis and the client&#13;
consultation generated expectations among stakeholders. The following section&#13;
summarizes the actions and procedures agreed with key stakeholders and the government&#13;
to ensure proper analysis of social issues and to channel beneficiary participation during&#13;
project implementation, which have been included in the project design (with&#13;
corresponding costs) and in the Operational Manual.&#13;
23.   Screening and Appraisal of Subproject Proposals. During the screening of new&#13;
subproject proposals, key socio-economic and organizational factors would be considered&#13;
to assess the potential social impacts and viability of the proposal. If potential negative&#13;
social impacts are foreseen, specific mitigation plans would be required for the proposals&#13;
to be considered. Subproject proposal that do not consider appropriate mitigation&#13;
measures would be returned for reformulation. Proposals would be screened by a&#13;
interdisciplinary committee that would include a social analyst to ensure key social issues,&#13;
including beneficiary participation, are properly addressed. To achieve a more balanced&#13;
ranking and assessment of subproject proposals and feasibility studies, beneficiary&#13;
participation and social issues would be assign a weight of 25% of the total score.&#13;
24.   Fostering Beneficiary Participation. Participation is an iterative process that&#13;
moves along the project cycle. Participation describes both the end and the means to&#13;
ensure beneficiary access to the decision making processes and to define development&#13;
priorities and activities. That is, participation is not an 'either/or' situation, but it includes&#13;
a wide range of activities and approaches, each with its own tradeoffs in terms of process-&#13;
related and informational goals and implementation. Perhaps the most important step in&#13;
defining the procedures and activities for strengthening beneficiary participation during&#13;
implementation is establishing clear goals and objectives, which in this case are the&#13;
development of appropriated support services, the transfer of certain services to the users&#13;
and, the development of the public sector and community organizations institutional&#13;
capacities. Given the above, the following elements have been proposed to strengthen&#13;
beneficiary participation: (i) dissemination; (ii) institutional mechanisms; (iii) training; and&#13;
(iv) institutional strengthening.&#13;
25.   Dissemination. Information-sharing focuses on the gathering and dissemination of&#13;
information involving local people through means such as public meetings, radio&#13;
programs, or written materials. One of the problems highlighted by the consultation was&#13;
the deficient and disparate level of information among the producers, their leaders,&#13;
provincial authorities and project team. The objectives of this subset of project activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-155-                            Annex G&#13;
are to provide producers with the required project information to participate in the&#13;
decision making process and to develop and facilitate the communication between the&#13;
beneficiaries and the UEP. The UEPs would have consultants (specialists in participation&#13;
and social assessment), that would be responsible for the design and implementation of the&#13;
dissemination activities. The activities proposed are:&#13;
(a)   Short-term consultation and information sharing. A first activity to be&#13;
developed by the UEPs would be a dissemination campaign organized at&#13;
the provincial level to make existing project information available to&#13;
producer associations and other provincial stakeholders. This operation&#13;
would involve: (i) public dissemination of project documents; and&#13;
(ii) meetings with interested groups at the local level to inform and discuss&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
(b)   Long-term dissemination and communication system. In the long term,&#13;
the UEPs would develop a permanent communication system comprising:&#13;
(i) bulletins and dissemination notes; and (ii) periodic meetings with&#13;
producer associations and other key provincial stakeholders (NGOs,&#13;
Universities, other government agencies).&#13;
26.   Institutional Mechanisms for Partcipation. As a result of the consultation and&#13;
organizational diagnosis, two institutional mechanisms were proposed for developing and&#13;
strengthening beneficiary participation in project implementation:&#13;
(a)   Local Fora. As a result of the dissemination activities, permanent advisory&#13;
groups, or fora (LF) would be created at the local level. These fora would&#13;
be comprised of representatives of producer associations, NGOs, and other&#13;
relevant stakeholders. They would have an advisory role to the UEPs,&#13;
contributing to the planning of project activities and analyzing project&#13;
implementation progress, particularly regarding social and environmental&#13;
issues.&#13;
The LF would constitute a mechanism for permanent feedback between the&#13;
UEPs and the beneficiaries, who would have a direct input in the discussion&#13;
of the POAs and in the monitoring and evaluation of project activities. The&#13;
LF would have direct access to the UEPs and would be responsible for&#13;
channeling information and demands between the beneficiaries and the&#13;
UEPs. The LF would meet regularly every two months, or at the request&#13;
of one of its members to analyze specific issues. The UEP would maintain&#13;
a permanent contact with the LF through the participation and social&#13;
assessment specialists, twice a year (prior to the approval of the POAs and&#13;
at the end of the first semester) they would meet with representatives of the&#13;
LF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -                          Annex G&#13;
(a)   Provincial Consultative Councils. At the provincial level, the UEPs&#13;
would stimulate the development of Consultative Councils (CC) with&#13;
representatives of the LF. The CC would advise the EPDAs on&#13;
participation, social and environmental issues. Also, the EPDAs would&#13;
discuss and analyze with the CC progress made in project implementation&#13;
at the provincial level.&#13;
The CC would establish a link between the local level (LF) and the&#13;
provincial level (EPDAs) that would allow beneficiaries to have a voice in&#13;
the discussion of policy issues and long term programming. In summary,&#13;
the proposed institutional mechanisms involve two levels that would allow&#13;
beneficiary participation and would feed the information required for&#13;
decision making. The LF would be in direct and permanent relation with&#13;
the beneficiaries and the UEPs, while the CC would be the link of the LF to&#13;
the EPDAs that have a broader policy-making role at the provincial level.&#13;
27.   Training. While producer associations need to enhance their organizational&#13;
development skills, project staff need to broaden their technical skills with participatory&#13;
methodologies and organizational techniques that would facilitate their work with project&#13;
beneficiaries. The objectives of the training activities proposed are to provide technical&#13;
assistance and training in managerial and organizational development to project staff and&#13;
producers and to stimulate the former to participate in their organizations. Proposed -&#13;
activities would be implemented at the regional and national levels. Training at the&#13;
regional level would be targeted to producers and administrative staff of the producer&#13;
associations. Training at the national level would focus on project staff and other agencies&#13;
or institutions involved in extension and technical assistance.&#13;
28.   The training activities would be developed during the first three years of the&#13;
project. The provincial and national seminars would be organized by the UEPs and the&#13;
UEC respectively.&#13;
(a)   Provincial Level. Two five-day seminars would be offered twice a year at&#13;
the provincial level. Participants (15) would be nominated by the LF&#13;
according to their needs.&#13;
(i)    Organizational development and participatory methods: This&#13;
seminar would address methodological issues on a number of tools&#13;
and techniques for developing participation and organizational&#13;
strengthening. The seminar would then lead to a discussion of&#13;
existing experiences and best practices.&#13;
(ii)   Management and negotiation skills: The first half of this seminar&#13;
would focus on basic organizational management and&#13;
administration principles for rural organizations and producer&#13;
associations. The second part would discuss essential negotiation&#13;
techniques for conflict resolution and consensus-building.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -                           Annex G&#13;
(b)   National Level. Two five days seminars on the topics listed below wquld&#13;
be organized by the UEC once a year. These seminars would be targeted&#13;
to the technical staff of the projects, and the participants would be selected&#13;
by the UEPs. The objective is to provide all staff with a common&#13;
methodological framework.&#13;
(i)    Social assessment: This seminar is an introduction to social&#13;
assessment methods for technical staff. The seminar would review&#13;
basic concepts and discuss the use of a wide range of techniques for&#13;
social assessment and participatory planing.&#13;
(ii)   Organizational development and participatory techniques: This&#13;
seminar would analyze key concepts of groups dynamics,&#13;
institutional diagnosis and tools for promoting beneficiary&#13;
participation.&#13;
29.   Besides these seminars, informal training activities such as field days and visits&#13;
would be organized by the UEPs. The specialist in participation and social assessment&#13;
would be responsible for the design and implementation of these activities in coordination&#13;
with the LF.&#13;
30.   Institutional Strengthening. To ensure the successful implementation of the&#13;
above-described activities, the UEC and UEPs need to be strengthened with the required&#13;
staff. At the central level, the UEC would be required to include two professionals:&#13;
(i) Social Assessment Coordinator; and (ii) Participation, Dissemination and Training&#13;
Specialist. Also, all UEPs would have to include a consultant specialist on social&#13;
assessment and participation.&#13;
(a)    The social assessment coordinator in the UEC would have the overall&#13;
responsibility for the screening and analysis of social and participation&#13;
issues in project proposals and feasibility studies. Also, the coordinator&#13;
would collaborate with the M&amp;E unit in the monitoring of social indicators&#13;
(performance and impact) and would coordinate all activities aimed at&#13;
promoting beneficiary participation.&#13;
(b)   The participation, dissemination and training specialist would collaborate&#13;
with the social assessment coordinator in the implementation of all social&#13;
assessment and training activities. This specialist would be in charge of&#13;
designing and implementing the training activities, and would provide&#13;
support to the UEPs on these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-158 -                           Annex G&#13;
31.   The consultants on social assessment and participation in the UEPs would be in&#13;
charge of the monitoring of social and participation issues at the project level. These&#13;
specialists would provide advice to the UEPs coordinators on social issues, particularly&#13;
during the preparation of the POAs and in the identification of potential negative social&#13;
impact and in the design of mitigation measures. They would also provide support to the&#13;
LF and CC on organizational development and participation issues.&#13;
&#13;

ARGENTINA&#13;
PROVINCIAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
1.    Effective and well-focused provincial institutions are needed to implement the&#13;
proposed project, and strengthen and continue the public decentralization process. This&#13;
will require clearly delineated mandates and jurisdictions, a rational organizational&#13;
structure, as well as sufficient financial and technical resources. This component of the&#13;
project would address many of the weaknesses inherent in the institutional relationship&#13;
between the national and provincial levels of government and at the provincial level.&#13;
2.    As part of project preparation an Institutional Capacity Analysis (ICA), based on&#13;
the Institutional Capacity Analysis and Development System (ICADS), was performed to&#13;
identify institutional capacity gaps and appropriate measures to close this gaps. The ICA&#13;
evaluated: (a) "rules of the game"; (b) inter-institutional relationships; (c) internal&#13;
management organization; (d) personnel policy and incentives; and (e) technical and&#13;
managerial skills.&#13;
3.    Poorly delineated responsibilities (the rules of the game) between the national and&#13;
provincial levels weaken coordination between the two levels and restrict provinces from&#13;
assuming an independent role with respect to support service delivery. Inter-institutional&#13;
relationships are often unproductive as the mechanisms, between the levels and within&#13;
each level, for assigning sectoral priorities and facilitating institutional coordination are&#13;
ineffective. Intemal institutional managerial structures inhibit effective management with&#13;
redundant assignment of responsibilities, inflexible and out-dated construction and poor&#13;
communication flows. Personnel policies (in practice, often non-transparent) and&#13;
incentives do not attract professionals with the skills needed to implement national and&#13;
provincial programs. Severe deficiencies were identified in: (i) modern management and&#13;
organization skills; (ii) policy, program and project design; (iii) data generation, processing&#13;
and application; and (iv) specific technical skills.&#13;
4.    Given these institutional weaknesses, a carefully designed institutional&#13;
development strategy and action program would be needed to ensure sound project&#13;
implementation and the sustainability of its benefits. The project's Institutional&#13;
Development Component (IDC) would provide technical assistance:&#13;
(a)   at the national level: (8 person/months (p/m)) to strengthen sectoral&#13;
planning and programming capabilities, as well as project monitoring and&#13;
evaluation skills;&#13;
(b)   at the provincial level: (1133 p/m) for provincial agricultural support&#13;
service coordinating entities; and&#13;

(c)   complementary subproject level technical assistance, funded through the&#13;
specific subprojects and not the IDC, would include 1399 p/m for&#13;
implementation of the following subprojects:&#13;
(i)    Bonaerense Valley of the Colorado River (Buenos Aires&#13;
Province): 88 p/m of technical assistance in technical skills,&#13;

support the system designs, market studies, communication and&#13;
training programs;&#13;
(ii)   Mendoza Province Irrigation Program: 175 p/m of technical&#13;
assistance in economics, water management, systems analysis and&#13;
environmental issues, as well as provide support for the&#13;
establishment of the project financial administration, provincial&#13;
database, and operational system for elaboration of consultants'&#13;
terms of reference, contract review and supervision.&#13;
(iii)   Alto Valley of the Rio Negro (Rio Negro Province): 373 p/m of&#13;
technical assistance in management, economics, water management,&#13;
agronomy, law, accounting/audit systems, data base management,&#13;
communication and group dynamics, rural diagnosis, irrigation&#13;
systems and administration. The technical assistance would&#13;
contribute to subproject design and implementation.&#13;
(iv)   Pozo Borrado Project (Santa Fe Province): 20 p/m of technical&#13;
assistance in accounting, water management, law and economy to&#13;
support project implementation and strengthen existing institutions;&#13;

specialists to assist the provincial implementation units install&#13;
project management and technical services, including the&#13;
installation of the coordination unit. In addition, technical assistance&#13;
would be provided in epidemiology, animal diseases, and sanitary&#13;
extension, as well as meat processing;&#13;
(vi)   Foot and Mouth Disease Campaign in Mesopotamia Zone&#13;
(Misiones, Corrientes and Entre Rios): 115 p/m of specialists in&#13;
epidemiology, animal health, sanitary education as well as in project&#13;
management;&#13;
(vii)  Phytosanitary Services of the NOA Region (SEFINOA): 319 p/m&#13;

5.    At the national/provincial level, 1503 p/m of technical assistance would provided&#13;
to support the Agricultural Information System (SIIA) (see Annex B).&#13;
6.    The IDC would support 60 training-activities, including formal courses,&#13;
workshops, seminars and fellowships to upgrade skills of staff implementing project tasks,&#13;
especially at the provincial level. At the national level, 12 courses would train 344 staff in&#13;
agriculture and livestock planning and programming coordination, including policy design,&#13;
project appraisal, follow-up organization and procedures, and environmental impact&#13;
management and organization. Specific subproject training activities, to be funded&#13;
through the subprojects, are:&#13;

            The main development objectives of the
            Provincial Agricultural Development Project are to: a)
            increase and diversify agricultural production and exports;
            b) increase and stabilize the agricultural incomes of small
            and medium size commercial farms; c) improve basic
            agricultural support service effectiveness to increase the
            international competitiveness of agricultural products; d)
            improve rural productive infrastructure to reduce production
            and marketing costs; e) strengthen national and provincial
            institutional capacity to formulate and analyze sectoral
            development policy; and f) rationalize public investments
            and promote an expanded private sector role in agricultural
            development.  To achieve the objectives, the project will:
            a) finance subprojects; b) strengthen institutional
            developments; and c) provide project coordination,
            management, monitoring, and evaluation.  The subprojects
            will be concentrated in the following areas: a)water
            resource management; b) rural infrastructure; c)
            technological development; d) animal health; e) plant
            health; f) market development; g) agricultural information;
            h) production and regulation of food products; and i)
