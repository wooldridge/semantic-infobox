A Sanitation Success Story from Southern Region in Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
This is a sanitation success story from the Southern Region of Ethiopia where 20 percent of the country's&#13;
population reside in 10 percent of a geographic area known for its high population density and ethnic&#13;
diversity. The story explains how the Regional Health Bureau decided to focus on preventable diseases&#13;
and how it then facilitated a strong region-wide commitment to high impact, public health interventions&#13;
through the empowerment of households resulting in a wave of household latrine building.&#13;

This sanitation story is distinctive because it was&#13;
successfully driven by the Health Bureau (working&#13;
closely with all key stakeholders), using their own&#13;
funds through a cascading process of advocacy,&#13;

community volunteers) and supportive supervision.&#13;

            From burden to communal responsibility : a
            sanitation success story from Southern Region in Ethiopia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This is a sanitation success story from
            the Southern Region of Ethiopia where 20 percent of the
            country's population reside in 10 percent of a
            geographic area known for its high population density and
            ethnic diversity. The story explains how the Regional Health
            Bureau decided to focus on preventable diseases and how it
            then facilitated a strong region-wide commitment to high
            impact, public health interventions through the empowerment
            of households resulting in a wave of household latrine building.
