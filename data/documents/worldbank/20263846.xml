Recommendation of the Committee under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement on the proposed Financing (Africa Higher Education Centers of&#13;
Excellence Project) to Burkina Faso&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits its&#13;
recommendation pursuant to said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association extend to&#13;
Burkina Faso a credit in an amount equivalent to SDR 5,200,000. The purpose of said credit is to&#13;
promote regional specialization among Participating Universities in areas that address regional&#13;
challenges and strengthen the capacities of these Universities to deliver quality training and&#13;
applied research.&#13;
I.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to extend such a financing,&#13;
and of the purpose to which the proceeds of the financing are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project toward the financing of which the&#13;
proceeds of such financing are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set&#13;
forth in Article I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the&#13;
economic development of Burkina Faso and is of high developmental priority in the light of the&#13;
needs of Burkina Faso.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said project merits financial assistance from the&#13;
Association, and hereby recommends said project for such assistance.&#13;
