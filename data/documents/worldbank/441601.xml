ChristopherM.    Government guarantees for private infrastructure projects represent real liabilities, and their&#13;
Lewis atnd       costs can average as much as a third of the amount guaranteed. Most governments do not know&#13;
Ashoka  dcaamde&#13;
the full extent of these liabilities, because they have made no attempt to systematically estimate&#13;
them. A companion Note (Viewpoint No. 148) proposes a new framework for identifying&#13;
government exposures, valuing expected and unexpected risks, and budgeting for expected risks&#13;
and reserving for unexpected ones. This Note shows how governments can use the valuation&#13;
process to analyze the distribution of risks, decide which risks they should bear and which should&#13;
be borne by the private sector, and reduce the frequency and size of calls on guarantees.&#13;
In what may be the first time that a sophisti-  pected loss. In keeping with the lattice of risks&#13;

            Government guarantees for private
            infrastructure projects represent real liabilities, and
            their costs can average as much as a third of the amount
            guaranteed. The authors show how governments can use a risk
            valuation process to analyze the distribution of risks,
            decide which risks they should bear and which should be
            borne by the private sector, and reduce the frequency and
            size of calls on guarantees.
