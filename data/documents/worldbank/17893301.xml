&amp;#12;Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When one thinks of border crossings in Africa, the image that comes to mind is&#13;
that of a long queue of trucks waiting idly to fill out paperwork. With the im-&#13;
provement of road infrastructure throughout Africaâ&#128;&#148;thanks to concerted efforts&#13;
by country governments, Regional Economic Communities and development&#13;
partnersâ&#128;&#148;the bottlenecks evoked by this image are even more prominent.&#13;
&#13;
Indeed, compared to 25 years ago when only 20 percent of the main road network&#13;
in Africa was considered to be in good condition, the present situationâ&#128;&#148;where&#13;
half of the network is in a good condition and the other half is fairâ&#128;&#148;was expected&#13;
to significantly reduce transport costs and prices. However, all the benefits derived&#13;
by this achievement are undermined by time lost at the border, a situation that is&#13;
now recognized to be a major obstacle to the intra-regional movement of goods&#13;
and people. This ever-more-visible barrier to trade is the bane of the trucking in-&#13;
dustry, which frequently comes under public scrutiny.&#13;
&#13;
On that backdrop, the notion of a One-Stop Border Post (OSBP) quickly took on&#13;
importance as a miracle solution. Under this, border agencies from neighboring&#13;
countries cooperate and coordinate their border-based interventions to save time.&#13;
In the last decade, several border posts on main trade corridors in Africa have been&#13;
converted into OSBPs, and many more are earmarked for conversion over the&#13;
coming years. However, results have rarely met expectations, as coordination be-&#13;
tween border agencies from different countries is far from simple. Furthermore, in&#13;
many cases border issues are perceived to be an infrastructure problem that is all&#13;
too often solved by remodeling facilities.&#13;
&#13;
In Eastern Africa, the Northern Corridor Secretariat has been a pioneer of fact-&#13;
based over opinion-based policy development. With support from SSATP, the&#13;
Secretariat has developed a comprehensive corridor performance measurement&#13;
framework. The surveys on the main border crossings along the Northern Corri-&#13;
dor are one of the many aspects of this effort. These surveys shed light on the rea-&#13;
sons for slow border processing in Eastern Africa. They not only document the&#13;

                                                                                   ix&#13;

impact of joint efforts by border agencies, but because their timing coincided with&#13;
the reform, they provide the opportunity to measure its effects in real time.&#13;
&#13;
This SSATP publication illustrates how effective cooperation between border&#13;
agencies results in a highly improved border crossing experience for truckers and&#13;
increased efficiency for trucking companies. By bringing a new perspective on the&#13;
relative importance of infrastructure versus inter-agency cooperation this study&#13;
resonates beyond the Northern Corridor.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Executive summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Land border crossings constitute obstacles to regional integration, and facilitating&#13;
the movement of goods and persons across borders ranks high in the priorities of&#13;
Regional Economic Communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. These obstacles are&#13;
common to gateway corridors serving the landlocked countries and also hinder&#13;
regional trade and international transit, thereby adding to the importance of ad-&#13;
dressing this challenge.&#13;
&#13;
Facilitating the movement of goods and persons across borders requires integrated&#13;
border management. Two levels of integration are important: nationally, between&#13;
the entire border management agencies represented at the border, and interna-&#13;
tionally, between the border management agencies on each side of the border.&#13;
&#13;
Increased coordination is the objective of the one-stop border post (OSBP) ap-&#13;
proach, which is gaining momentum in several regions of Africa. In East Africa,&#13;
the East Africa Community (EAC), the corridor authorities and their member&#13;
states have decided to convert all major border posts into OSBP, whether situated&#13;
on a gateway corridor or on a purely regional route. The East Africa OSBP pro-&#13;
gram benefits from the coordinated support of bilateral and multilateral donors.&#13;
&#13;
The SSATP is a partner of the East Africa OSBP program through its regional inte-&#13;
gration component. SSATP aims to develop a methodology to establish and sus-&#13;
tain corridor transport observatories, identify measures to improve institutional&#13;
capacity to define and implement appropriate policies and strategies to facilitate&#13;
regional trade and transport, and disseminate best practices on corridor manage-&#13;
ment. The value added of SSATP in the East Africa OSBP program is its extensive&#13;
experience in performance monitoring and surveys, and notably its methodology&#13;
for border-crossing surveys.&#13;
&#13;
The Malaba border post (between Kenya and Uganda) is a pilot in the East Africa&#13;
OSBP program, and several projects are contributing to its transformation into a&#13;
full OSBP. The Malaba, Busia (also between Kenya and Uganda) and Gatuna /&#13;
Katuna (between Uganda and Rwanda) border posts constitute the main and busi-&#13;

&amp;#12;Border Crossing Monitoring along the Northern Corridor&#13;

&#13;
est border posts along the Northern Corridor, which spans between the ports of&#13;
Mombasa and the landlocked countries and regions of East Africa.&#13;
&#13;
The SSATP and the Secretariat of the Transit and Transport Coordination Author-&#13;
ity of the Northern Corridor (TTCA-NC) commissioned a survey of the three&#13;
border posts to establish a baseline prior to their conversion into OSBP.&#13;
&#13;
During the survey period, the Customs authorities in Kenya and Uganda modified&#13;
selected business procedures that resulted in a dramatic decrease of the border-&#13;
crossing times. This unexpected situation provided a unique opportunity to ob-&#13;
serve and measure the impact of these decisions. The measures targeted the three&#13;
types of parties involved in border crossings:&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Border management agencies, through advance preparation with pre-&#13;
          arrival lodgment of the declaration, and when the trucks have arrived,&#13;
          through coordination between appropriate agencies&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Clearing agents through mandatory pre-arrival lodgment of declarations&#13;
          (used to be optional and at the discretion of the agents, hence rarely used)&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;§   Truck drivers through traffic and parking rules to decongest Customs&#13;
          Controlled Zone&#13;
&#13;
A key aspect of these measures is that they have produced dramatic results even in&#13;
the absence of infrastructure refurbishment, which is expected to take place at a&#13;
later stage. However, these measure build on all the preparatory work required for&#13;
the creation of an OSBP: the culture of cooperation across border agencies (within&#13;
and across countries), the legal framework enabling that cooperation, and the&#13;
supporting IT infrastructure that allows preparing the documentation process&#13;
prior to the arrival of the trucks. This is an important fact to remember when nu-&#13;
merous programs of border reform tend to focus on the infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
Crossing times that were routinely over 48 hours dropped to less than six hours;&#13;
average border-crossing time, a measure that covers a wide range of situations,&#13;
dropped from 24 hours to 4 hours. Based on estimates of the value of time for&#13;
trucking enterprises (releasing capacity for increased activity and revenue) and for&#13;
traders (through reduced inventory costs), the savings generated by the improve-&#13;
ment of the situation represent up to $70 million per year.&#13;
&#13;
The changes build on preceding work of the East Africa OSBP program that lays&#13;
the ground work for customs authorities to reach decisions to improve trade facili-&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
tation, notably a strong framework for inter-agency and inter-country coopera-&#13;
tion, and an enabling IT environment.&#13;
&#13;
In the Northern Corridor context, the survey highlighted several areas that will&#13;
require discussion among stakeholders and further action, notably:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Customs operates on a 24/7 basis while other border management agen-&#13;
         cies and service providers (clearing and forwarding agents, and drivers)&#13;
         may not&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    The findings highlight where procedures have not been implemented.&#13;
         Most notably, procedures not implemented include the priority granted&#13;
         to tanker trucks for safety reasons, and the direct crossing to the entry&#13;
         side of the border&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    The reduction of border-crossing time will impact the driving patterns on&#13;
         the Northern Corridor. Long stays at the border used to constitute con-&#13;
         venient rest stops for drivers. The generalization of same day crossings&#13;
         will require drivers and trucking companies to adjust to new travel pat-&#13;
         terns along the corridor, and consider other locations for their rest stops&#13;
&#13;
The survey also provided the opportunity to clarify the methodology. The time&#13;
taken to cross a border can vary widely, depending on the characteristics of the&#13;
crossing, notably the nature of the load, the nature of the transactions conducted&#13;
at the border, and the arrival time of the truck. Rather than capturing an average&#13;
crossing by combining contrasted patterns, the survey methodology aims to ana-&#13;
lyze the detailed characteristics of a limited set of patterns corresponding to the&#13;
most common scenarios. Supplementing the survey with contextual data is essen-&#13;
tial to target the relevant scenarios to analyze.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 xv&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Border-crossing times in East Africa have been identified as a major constraint for&#13;
smooth trade flows, both for regional trade and for international transit. Delays at&#13;
borders disrupt efficient trade logistics, impacting on the transport costs and pric-&#13;
es, and ultimately on trade competitiveness. In order to improve the efficiency of&#13;
border crossings in East Africa, the EAC has resolved to convert the main border&#13;
crossings into a Stop Border Post (OSBP), in which all border agencies from the&#13;
two sides of the border coordinate their interventions, thus reducing documenta-&#13;
tion processing time. This program is supported by several multilateral and bilat-&#13;
eral donors as component of their assistance to regional integration in the EAC.&#13;
&#13;
As a contribution of SSATP support to this joint effort, the stakeholders and the&#13;
Secretariat of the Transit and Transport Coordination Authority of the Northern&#13;
Corridor (TTCA-NC) helped define a plan to establish measurable performance&#13;
indicators for the Malaba border post (border between Kenya and Uganda), Busia&#13;
border post (border between Kenya and Uganda just below Malaba) and Gatuna&#13;
border post (border between Uganda and Rwanda). The three selected border&#13;
posts are the first borders crossed by transit goods on their journey from the port&#13;
of Mombasa, and the most important in terms of traffic volumes, with over 600&#13;
truck crossings per day in the busiest direction at Malaba.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed monitoring of the border-crossing times takes place prior to the&#13;
transformation of the border posts into OSBP. This provides a reference situation&#13;
against which reductions in border-crossing times can be measured after trans-&#13;
formation. The SSATP recruited a consultant, Transport Logistics Consultants&#13;
(TLC), to measure border-crossing times on the three selected border posts. The&#13;
survey was conducted for the months of November 2011 to March 2012.&#13;
&#13;
The initial objective of the survey was to establish a baseline for typical border&#13;
crossings. It was to identify in the process problem areas that require attention and&#13;
provide elements of the diagnostic that will support an inclusive dialogue between&#13;
all stakeholders, who were to define a course of action to correct deficiencies.&#13;
However, several changes in the border-crossing procedure at Malaba occurred in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   1&#13;

&#13;
the middle of the survey period, resulting in dramatic decreases in crossing times.&#13;
This provided the unique opportunity to witness and measure the impact of the&#13;
changes as they were unfolding. Some of the problem areas revealed by the survey&#13;
also showed that focusing on typical border-crossing scenarios was not sufficient.&#13;
A revision of the survey methodology was required to adequately collect sufficient&#13;
data for a more diverse set of crossing scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
The objective of this work is therefore twofold:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Present the results of the survey for the main three Northern Corridor&#13;
          border crossings, focusing on the elements of diagnostic which will con-&#13;
          stitute the input for the next stage â&#128;&#147; the dialogue among stakeholders to&#13;
          further improve border-crossing conditions â&#128;&#147; but also on the conse-&#13;
          quences of the effectiveness of soft measures that can dramatically reduce&#13;
          border-crossing delays as revealed by the results on the Malaba border.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Reflect on the methodology and its possible refinements as input for the&#13;
          continuation of the survey program, whether in the context of the EAC or&#13;
          in other regions of Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
&#13;
The paper is divided into four sections. The first section provides background in-&#13;
formation on the Northern Corridor. The second section presents the conclusions&#13;
that can be drawn from the surveyâ&#128;&#148;presented in the Northern Corridor context&#13;
with the key issues that will require further discussion among stakeholders and&#13;
further action. From a wider perspective, this section also emphasizes the shift of&#13;
relative importance that should be attributed to the hard and the soft agendas of&#13;
border crossings based on the analysis of the impact of the changes at the Malaba&#13;
border post.&#13;
&#13;
The last two sections present the surveys conducted on the Northern Corridor; the&#13;
third section reviews the survey methodology as it was applied and suggests ad-&#13;
justments for future surveys, and the fourth section presents the detailed survey&#13;
findings for each border post.&#13;

&amp;#12;Background on Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Northern Corridor is the transport and logistics network linking East Africa&#13;
countries to its overseas trading partners through the port of Mombasa 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Transit and Transport Coordination Authority of the Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
In 1985, the Governments of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi signed the&#13;
Northern Corridor Transit and Transport Agreement with a view to overcome&#13;
transit challenges affecting them. The Treaty entered into force in 1986, and the&#13;
Democratic Republic of Congo joined the agreement in 1987.&#13;
&#13;
Changes in the environment (such as the shift towards using only the private sec-&#13;
tor in the provision of transport services, the provision of infrastructure and facili-&#13;
ties, the strengthening of regional integration, and economic development con-&#13;
cerns) led to a major revision of the treaty when the renewal period expired in&#13;
2006. As a consequence, the scope of the treaty has broadened since its inception&#13;
to include development and regional integration issues related to trade and&#13;
transport facilitation.&#13;
&#13;
In order to support the implementation of the treaty, the Transit and Transport&#13;
Coordination Authority of the Northern Corridor (TTCA-NC), with a secretariat&#13;
based in Mombasa (Kenya), was established. The TTCA-NC provides the forum in&#13;
which public and private stakeholders engage in trade and transport facilitation on&#13;
issues and policies. It also provides a platform for monitoring the implementation&#13;
and impact of those policies. The TTCA-NC Secretariat has been a pioneer in the&#13;
development of a comprehensive corridor-performance-monitoring framework&#13;
that observes the multiple dimensions of corridor efficiency through a series of&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  The hinterland of the port of Mombasa includes Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the&#13;
Eastern part of DR Congo, the northern part of Tanzania, South Sudan. Access to northern&#13;
Tanzania uses only the Kenya portion of the Northern Corridor infrastructure. Rwanda,&#13;
Burundi and eastern DR Congo transit through Uganda. South Sudan has two route op-&#13;
tions, one through Kenya only entering after Lokichoggio, and one through Uganda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      3&#13;

ciency of the logistics operators and control agencies. It measures these dimen-&#13;
sions at both synthetic and disaggregated levels. The survey of border-crossing&#13;
times is a component of that monitoring activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trade and traffic statistics&#13;
&#13;
The port of Mombasa is a major maritime gateway to East Africa and its hinter-&#13;
land extends beyond the countries that are signatories to the NCTA to cover&#13;
Northern Tanzania and Southern Sudan. Transit represents a significant percent-&#13;
age of the activity of the port of Mombasa, with a share that has been fluctuating&#13;
between 25 percent and 30 percent throughout the last decade. Transit traffic is&#13;
imbalanced: imports predominate; exports from the transit countries represent&#13;
only 8 percent of the imports for the same countries.&#13;

Uganda is the main contributor to transit volumes from Mombasa. The respective&#13;
positions for the other countries have evolved over time. Tanzania used to be the&#13;
second hinterland market for the port of Mombasa (its north-eastern part is more&#13;
accessible from Mombasa than from Dar es Salaam), but its importance has reced-&#13;
ed. The most recent change is the dramatic increase of traffic to Sudan, which has&#13;
become the second hinterland market for the port of Mombasa.&#13;
&#13;
Most of the hinterland countries are connected to Mombasa through the Northern&#13;
Corridor. This explains why Malaba and Busia are the two busiest border crossings&#13;
on the Northern Corridor. Based on the first quarter 2012, more than 600 trucks&#13;
cross daily from Kenya to Uganda at Malaba. Combined, around 300,000 trucks&#13;
are crossing the border at Malaba and Busia every year.&#13;

 Border crossing in East Africa&#13;
&#13;
 Road transport companies in East Africa have been complaining about the wait&#13;
 time at border crossings, which adds unnecessary idle time and reduces the num-&#13;
 ber of roundtrips they can complete per year. This, in turn, affects negatively their&#13;
 operations and profitability.&#13;
&#13;
 In the absence of systematic measurement of border-crossing times along the&#13;
 Northern Corridor, there is only anecdotal data to quantify the magnitude of the&#13;
 delays. A baseline survey funded by the SSATP in 2006 estimated the average bor-&#13;
 der-crossing time at 48 hours.&#13;

&amp;#12;Border Crossing Monitoring along the Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The EAC adopted a regional approach for reducing border-crossing delays by&#13;
transforming the border posts on the priority regional transport network into&#13;
One-Stop Border Posts (OSBP). Several bilateral and multilateral donors partici-&#13;
pated in the effort according to their respective comparative advantages:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Infrastructure development was supported by the World Bank, the Afri-&#13;
          can Development Bank and TradeMark East Africa (TMEA)&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    The institutional framework by JICA (Japan International Cooperation&#13;
          Agency)&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    The enabling IT by TMEA and USAID (US Agency for International De-&#13;
          velopment)&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Capacity building for logistics operators (road transport and C&amp;F agents)&#13;
          by JICA, USAID and TMEA&#13;
&#13;
Under the OSBP model adopted in EAC, exit procedures take place on the entry&#13;
side, with the trucks proceeding directly through the customs area on the exit side&#13;
of the border to the entry side. A regional agreement provides the framework for&#13;
extra-territorial jurisdiction of border management agencies; this allows joint con-&#13;
trols on only one side of the border.&#13;
&#13;
The conversion of Malaba into an OSBP dates back to 2002 when a Kenya-Uganda&#13;
task force was established. The initial focus was on rail transport, with joint railway&#13;
border posts opened in Malaba in 2006. For road transport, changes in the border&#13;
process started in 2008, with specific treatment granted to certain types of loads,&#13;
notably tanker trucks, and the customs operating hours extended to 24/7.&#13;

&amp;#12;Lessons from the surveys&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the wider context of border reforms&#13;
&#13;
The most important conclusion of the surveys has relevance beyond the Northern&#13;
Corridor; efforts to reduce border delays do yield results, as evidenced by the case&#13;
of Malaba. The measures to adopt target the three types of parties involved in bor-&#13;
der crossings:&#13;
&#13;
         ï&#130;§     Border management agencies, through advance preparation with&#13;
               pre-arrival lodgment of the declaration, and when the trucks have ar-&#13;
               rived, through coordination between appropriate agencies&#13;
&#13;
         ï&#130;§     Clearing agents through mandatory pre-arrival lodgment of declara-&#13;
               tions (used to be optional and at the discretion of the agents, hence&#13;
               rarely used)&#13;
&#13;
         ï&#130;§     Truck drivers through traffic and parking rules to decongest Cus-&#13;
               toms Controlled Zone&#13;

&#13;
A key aspect of these measures is that they have produced dramatic results even in&#13;
the absence of infrastructure refurbishment, which is expected to take place at a&#13;
later stage. However, these measure build on all the preparatory work required for&#13;
the creation of an OSBP: the culture of cooperation across border agencies (within&#13;
and across countries), the legal framework enabling that cooperation, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    7&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
supporting IT infrastructure that allows preparing the documentation process&#13;
prior to the arrival of the trucks. This is an important fact to remember when nu-&#13;
merous programs of border reform tend to focus on the infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
The magnitude of the improvement is impressive. On average, crossing times&#13;
dropped from around 24 hours at the end of 2011 to less than 4 hours in 2012, for&#13;
both directions. Predictability also improved, with a standard deviation in the&#13;
range of 10-15 percent of the average, compared to 50-70 percent in 2011.&#13;
&#13;
The dramatic improvement of the situation at the border was confirmed by the&#13;
border management agencies and the operators during the presentation of the&#13;
preliminary survey results to the Northern Corridor stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
In practical terms, such reduction corresponds for most trucks to a gain of two full&#13;
days in the outbound direction. Before the change in procedures, 60 percent of the&#13;
containers and half of the break-bulk trucks were crossing in 48 hours or more.&#13;
After the change, all trucks but one passed the border in less than 6 hours.&#13;
&#13;
Shorter border-crossing times mean that trucks are reaching their destination fast-&#13;
er, with two direct consequences: traders receive their goods earlier, saving on in-&#13;
ventory, and trucking enterprises can accomplish more roundtrips per year, in-&#13;
creasing their revenue. In a study on total logistics costs on the Northern Corri-&#13;
dor 2, estimates of the monetary costs of the delays were at $247.40 per 24 hours for&#13;
a truck, and $137.00 for the goods, a total of $384.40 for a loaded truck. On the&#13;
basis of 600 trucks per day, over 360 days, and a savings averaging of 20 hours, the&#13;
total annual savings can be estimated at $69,192,000 ($44,532,000 for the trucking&#13;
enterprises, and $24,660,000 for the traders).&#13;
&#13;
Another option to estimate the savings would be to convert the total number of&#13;
hours saved by the trucking enterprises (600 trucks over 360 days saving 20 hours&#13;
each) into additional roundtrips per year that could be accomplished: based on a&#13;
conservative estimate of two roundtrips a month for the average operator, this&#13;
represents an addition revenue for 12,000 trips, each with an income of $3,500, or&#13;
a total of $42M, consistent with the other estimate. For trucking enterprises, those&#13;
estimates are based on the assumption that the unfrozen capacity will not remain&#13;
idle and will actually generate additional revenue.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the context of the Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
Divergence between theory and practice&#13;
The survey results also show some divergence between the announced and actual&#13;
procedures, when for instance the sequencing of the process revealed by the sur-&#13;
veys contradicts what is advertised as the rule. The reasons are not completely clear&#13;
and should be further investigated, but the priority for tankers does not seem en-&#13;
forced, nor does the practice of allowing trucks to cross the exit border to com-&#13;
plete the documentation process.&#13;
&#13;
Tanker preferential treatment. Border management agencies grant preferential&#13;
treatment to tankers, essentially for safety reasons. That would imply that tanker&#13;
truck crossing times are much shorter than for other truck types. Also, tanker&#13;
trucks are supposed to cross over to the entry side directly.&#13;
&#13;
In practice, this is not the case:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    In Malaba, tanker truck crossing times are shorter than the average, but&#13;
          still equivalent to break bulk truck times. The duration of the stay on the&#13;
          exit side of the border is also comparable to break bulk trucks.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    In Busia, tanker truck crossing times are shorter than the average, but still&#13;
          comparable to consolidated truck crossing times, and so is the duration&#13;
          of their stay on the exit side of the border.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    In Gatuna, tanker trucks are taking longer to cross the border than any&#13;
          other truck types, and also stay longer on the exit side.&#13;
&#13;
This may be linked to the limitations of the infrastructure, which do not allow for&#13;
tanker trucks to by-pass the line. At any rate, additional investigation is required.&#13;
&#13;
Trucks proceeding to the other side of the border. In the model adopted by OSBP&#13;
in East Africa, exit procedures are taking place on the entry side, with the trucks&#13;
proceeding directly through the customs area on the exit side of the border to the&#13;
entry side. In practice, the main part of the time spent at the border occurs on the&#13;
exit side for the border between Kenya and Uganda. It is only for Gatuna that the&#13;
time spent on the entry side is longer than on the exit side, and at Malaba in-&#13;
bound, after the change of procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       9&#13;

&#13;
The measure of the time spent on each side of the border is linked to the truck&#13;
location, not the documentation process. Since new procedures were put in place&#13;
at Malaba, documents are processed on the entry side even before the truck has&#13;
crossed over. The respective duration of the stay may be linked to physical reasons,&#13;
such as movement and parking opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
24/7 operations&#13;
&#13;
This is a key issue. When Customs authorities agreed to operate 24/7, it was antic-&#13;
ipated that the other border management agencies would follow suit. However,&#13;
this did not happen, and other agencies, as well as clearing and forwarding agents&#13;
(C&amp;F), are still operating only during regular business hours. Trucking enterprises&#13;
did not adjust driving patterns to take advantage of extended operating hours, and&#13;
the majority of the truck arrivals are still occurring during daytime hours.&#13;
&#13;
Due to the limited number of night arrivals, the survey was not specifically de-&#13;
signed to measure the impact of night arrivals on the border-crossing time. De-&#13;
spite this choice, a number of trucks surveyed at Malaba and Busia arrived at the&#13;
border outside of regular business hours.&#13;
&#13;
At Malaba, surveyed truck arrivals outside of the period 6:00am-6:00pm represent&#13;
less than 10 percent of the sample, while in Busia, more than half of the surveyed&#13;
crossings were outside.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis of the survey results clearly shows that the time attributed to the&#13;
driver between the arrival and the remittance of the documents to the C&amp;F agent&#13;
correspond to the waiting time before regular business hours. Although the sample&#13;
for Malaba is small, it conforms to the same pattern as Busia. When a truck arrives&#13;
outside of regular business hours, the delays are almost exactly the time difference&#13;
to the opening office hours. When they arrive during regular office hours, the wait&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Lessons from the surveys&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
is minimal, with more delays in the morning than in the afternoon, due to the&#13;
backlog of trucks accumulated after office hours, creating a queue in the morning.&#13;
&#13;
However, arrival patterns of trucks are not random. Drivers can decide to stop&#13;
well before the border to spend the night so as to arrive at the border in the morn-&#13;
ing, or decide to drive up to the border and wait. The issue of arrival times and rest&#13;
stops is connected.&#13;
&#13;
Independently of the causes for night arrivals, whether by the driverâ&#128;&#153;s choice or&#13;
caused by some events, analysis of the crossing times shows clearly that the operat-&#13;
ing hours are an issue, and customs indicated that in light of the current situation,&#13;
the 24/7 operation decision may be reviewed.&#13;
&#13;
Rest stops and border crossing&#13;
&#13;
With the decrease of the border-crossing times, border posts can no longer be used&#13;
as rest stops for drivers, and overnight stays are becoming the exception. Customs&#13;
parking areas have limited capacity, and are not designed as rest stops, but tempo-&#13;
rary parking areas during the border-crossing process.&#13;
&#13;
As a consequence, demand for specialized rest stop areas with adequate facilities&#13;
for drivers has emerged as an issue that is separate from the borders and should be&#13;
addressed within road infrastructure programs in close cooperation with the&#13;
trucking industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Options for follow-up on the revealed challenges&#13;
&#13;
The survey of the three border posts is one aspect of the wider cooperation be-&#13;
tween bilateral and multilateral donors, EAC and the member states for the estab-&#13;
lishment of OSBP in East Africa. In addition to the contribution of SSATP through&#13;
the surveys of the three border posts, TMEA has agreed to conduct similar surveys&#13;
for other selected border posts. The lessons, both in terms of results of the changes&#13;
introduced by the Customs authorities and in terms of refinement of the method-&#13;
ology, will be taken into account in the next stages.&#13;
&#13;
For the three border posts surveyed, intermediate results were presented to the&#13;
Northern Corridor stakeholders during a workshop held on March 29, 2012. The&#13;
participants included representatives from ministries in charge of transport, Cus-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     11&#13;
&amp;#12;Border Crossing Monitoring along the Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
toms authorities, other border agencies, road transport operators and associations,&#13;
and C&amp;F agents and their industry association.&#13;
&#13;
The presentation of the results triggered a debate on the measures needed to im-&#13;
prove border crossings. The participants expressed the need to go beyond meas-&#13;
urements and start an inclusive dialogue between all stakeholders to further dis-&#13;
cuss the diagnosis, then identify and implement remedies.&#13;
&#13;
Participants also commented on the design of the surveys and recommended in-&#13;
cluding in the analysis of border-crossing times the impact of the following:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Intervention of other border agencies&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Differentiation of crossing times according to the process, notably be-&#13;
          tween transit and import, particularly when there is border clearance&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Operating times for the different border agencies and operators&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Adequacy of staffing&#13;
&#13;
Several of the additional clarifications and questions raised by the participants&#13;
have methodological implications. For future monitoring exercises, the question&#13;
of building a representative sample that enables analyzing all areas of concern will&#13;
have to be carefully addressed.&#13;
&#13;
The TTCA-NC was requested by the participants to prepare a paper on the follow-&#13;
up activities to undertake after the monitoring period to support the development&#13;
of adequate remedies on the Northern Corridor border crossings that would cover&#13;
the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Thematic working groups with stakeholders to review the main identified&#13;
          topics, notably&#13;
               -    Tanker trucks&#13;
               -    Operating hours and the 24/7 option, including impact of staff-&#13;
                    ing requirements and the role of the other border management&#13;
                    agencies&#13;
               -    IT and customs processes&#13;
               -    Rest stop for truck drivers&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Survey conducted at the end of the activity to measure progress made&#13;
          versus baseline&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             Lessons from the surveys&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The thematic working group will enable identifying solutions and responsible enti-&#13;
ty for their implementation. Additional technical assistance may be necessary to&#13;
further define the requirement for their implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                  13&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Choke monitoring methodology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The transport observatory on the Northern Corridor has been designed to meas-&#13;
ure corridor efficiency at disaggregated levels for the main modes and nodes, in&#13;
order to pinpoint the major choke points on the logistics chains. However, the&#13;
nature of the data collected on a routine basis may not be sufficient to fully under-&#13;
stand the underlying causes for the inefficiencies revealed by more synthetic indi-&#13;
cators, and for those complex choke points, dedicated surveys are required. This is&#13;
notably the case for inland border crossings, in which several physical and docu-&#13;
mentary processes are taking place.&#13;
&#13;
The objective of detailed analysis of the border-crossing times is to measure the&#13;
time taken by the interventions of the logistics operators and control agencies at&#13;
the border, with a view to:&#13;
&#13;
  ï&#130;§ identify delays or uncertainties in the time taken by interventions&#13;
&#13;
  ï&#130;§ identify time lost between successive interventions&#13;
  ï&#130;§ provide information for corridor management decision making bodies&#13;
&#13;
A methodology has been developed and tested on several border crossings:&#13;
&#13;
  ï&#130;§ Beitbridge, between South Africa and Zimbabwe, with continuous survey on a&#13;
    sample of crossings over the period December 2005 to June 2006&#13;
&#13;
  ï&#130;§ Chirundu, between Zimbabwe and Zambia, with surveys for a period of 11&#13;
    months from November 2006 to September 2007&#13;
  ï&#130;§ Spot surveys of the main Southern Africa border crossings, involving short&#13;
    surveys over a period of few days for each border post&#13;
&#13;
This methodology entails recording the main stages of a full border crossing, from&#13;
arrival of the truck to its departure, for a sample of vehicles. For the sample trucks,&#13;
additional information is collected on the consignment, its routing, and relevant&#13;
information on the trip prior to arrival at the border.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    15&#13;
&amp;#12;Border Crossing Monitoring along the Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sampling&#13;
&#13;
Border-crossing times can differ greatly according to the nature of the trade (type&#13;
of goods, border formalities, etc.), but also to the conditions of arrival at the bor-&#13;
der (day, time, congestion, etc.), resulting in a vast range of crossing scenarios.&#13;
Combining all the scenarios to measure an â&#128;&#152;averageâ&#128;&#153; border-crossing time for a&#13;
statistically representative sample is therefore not the primary objective of the sur-&#13;
vey. The objective was to measure border-crossing times for an homogeneous&#13;
group of trucks conforming to typical border-crossings scenarios, and decompose&#13;
the total time between the different parties involved (customs and other border&#13;
management agencies, C&amp;F agents, and drivers) to identify where possible effi-&#13;
ciency gains could be found.&#13;
&#13;
As a result, the construction of the sample focused on prioritizing some scenarios&#13;
over others that were less frequent. The positive aspect is that the results are repre-&#13;
sentative of the typical border-crossing scenarios privileged, instead of summariz-&#13;
ing in a single figure different patterns. However, the negative side is that specific&#13;
analysis for different patterns cannot be completed from the sample.&#13;
&#13;
The sample must be constructed so as to contain sufficient observations for each&#13;
stratum, identified by the three factors:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Type of load (containerized, tankers, break bulk)&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Trade (empty, domestic transit or border clearance, through transit)&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Arrival time (day, evening, night for instance)&#13;
&#13;
In the preparation of the surveys, interviews with border agency officials, clearing&#13;
agents, trucking companies and drivers must be conducted to collect information&#13;
on the border processes and reveal the perception of the problems by the logistics&#13;
operators and the control agencies. This information, combined with additional&#13;
data on the nature of the trade, the volumes, and the arrival times at the border,&#13;
will determine the major scenarios that will be surveyed.&#13;
&#13;
Traffic counts for type of load and trade&#13;
&#13;
For loaded trucks, there is a customs declaration which contains at least the fol-&#13;
lowing information, which is relevant for the surveys:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Truck number plates (which can be converted into country of vehicle&#13;
          registration)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              Choke monitoring methodology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;§      Date and time of submission of the declaration (the date enables daily&#13;
              traffic counts)&#13;
       ï&#130;§      Type of declaration (to distinguish between through transit and import)&#13;
       ï&#130;§      Commodity (which may with appropriate treatment allow for separation&#13;
              of the crossings between containerized goods, tankers, and others)&#13;
&#13;
 It is possible to exploit this information on the entry side of the border to confirm&#13;
 daily traffic counts by type of truck / load, nationality of carrier and type of trade,&#13;
 and guide the sampling of the trucks. It is easier to extract that information direct-&#13;
 ly from the customs IT when the operations at the border are computerized, oth-&#13;
 erwise, it is necessary to derive it from manual registries.&#13;
&#13;
 In terms of trade characteristics, for the Kenya-Uganda borders, trucks returning&#13;
 to Kenya empty were omitted on purpose, whereas for Rwanda-Uganda, a limited&#13;
 number of empty returns were included in the sample. 80 percent of the maritime&#13;
 transit traffic on the Northern Corridor is Ugandan trade. Therefore, through&#13;
 transit trucks en route to countries beyond Uganda are relatively rare, and no par-&#13;
 ticular efforts were made to include a representative number of through transit&#13;
 crossings in the sample. Their actual number in the sample is limited.&#13;
&#13;
 The Revenue Authorities on the Northern Corridor provided information on the&#13;
 number of loaded truck crossings per month during the survey period.&#13;

&amp;#12;Border Crossing Monitoring along the Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Based on the previous monitoring activities conducted in Beitbridge (between&#13;
South Africa and Zimbabwe) and in Chirundu (between Zimbabwe and Zambia),&#13;
and on the resources available, an average of 40 detailed border crossings per di-&#13;
rection and per month is a realistic expectation. In order to eliminate possible sea-&#13;
sonal variations, the survey was to be conducted over a period of six months. In&#13;
total, around 500 truck crossings per border were envisioned, with a sample robust&#13;
enough, for the selected scenarios, to guarantee reliable results. For logistical rea-&#13;
sons, the survey period was shortened, but the number of monthly observations&#13;
increased to compensate for the reduced duration. Over a period of four and a half&#13;
months (the surveys started in mid-November), 1,274 crossings were observed and&#13;
analyzed. Outbound refers to the outbound direction from the port of Mombasa&#13;
to the landlocked countries and the hinterland, while inbound refers to the oppo-&#13;
site direction to the port.&#13;
&#13;
Arrival time patterns&#13;
&#13;
The issue of 24/7 operations for border posts is important, because of its implica-&#13;
tion in terms of staffing for border agencies and operators. Extended hours of op-&#13;
eration only make sense if all parties involved have compatible operating hours&#13;
and if trucks take advantage of the extended period.&#13;
&#13;
The initial review of the borders revealed that despite 24h operations for customs,&#13;
night arrivals represent only a small portion, and the survey efforts were concen-&#13;
trated over regular operating hours. For instance, based on KRA information, at&#13;
Malaba, 75 percent of the trucks arrive between 7:00am and 9:00pm, 15 percent&#13;
between 9:00pm and 11:00pm, and only 10 percent between 11:00pm and 7:00am,&#13;
due to the fact that most trucking companies do not allow night driving for securi-&#13;
ty reasons. Arrivals are therefore bunched together, creating congestions during&#13;
peak periods, and increasing crossing times accordingly. Consequently, the survey&#13;
focused on daylight arrivals at the border, and the sampling stratification was ori-&#13;
ented towards truck load types (containerized goods, break bulk, refrigerated,&#13;
tanker, and consolidated).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The survey questionnaire&#13;
&#13;
The survey questionnaire was divided into three main sections:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Characteristics of the truck / trip (origin, destination, type of load, de-&#13;
          scription of the cargo, truck identifiers, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          Choke monitoring methodology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Border crossing events&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Obstacles encountered prior to arrival at the border&#13;
&#13;
Characteristics of the truck / trip&#13;
&#13;
The information obtained through this section is important to differentiate the&#13;
border crossing scenarios. However, for future surveys, it is important to clarify&#13;
the nature of the customs process at the border. For instance, when the entry&#13;
country is the destination country, it is important to clarify whether the process&#13;
was a domestic transit or a border clearance.&#13;
&#13;
The Northern Corridor surveys collected the following information on the charac-&#13;
teristics of the trip:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Nature of the goods, and their classification under the Harmonized Sys-&#13;
          tem Code&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Origin of the goods (pick up point)&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Destination of the goods (delivery point)&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Identity of the transporter (and his/her nationality)&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Truck plate number&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Exit clearing agent&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Entry clearing agent&#13;
&#13;
However, due to the selection bias in the construction of the sample and the very&#13;
low percentage of truck crossing surveyed, inferences on the total population of&#13;
truck crossings are not reliable.&#13;
&#13;
Crossing events section&#13;
&#13;
The section on border crossing events consists of a series of time stamps corre-&#13;
sponding to the stages of the border crossing identified at the preparation stage.&#13;
&#13;
A typical border crossing is a combination of physical movements of the trucks&#13;
and the associated documentation process. The stages of the border crossing,&#13;
which tended to be sequential, are now adopting more complex patterns, with a&#13;
tendency to develop parallel processes in order to save time. For instance, docu-&#13;
ments are processed by the Customs authorities from both sides in parallel, while&#13;
the truck is still on the exit side of the border, and the declaration process can be&#13;
initiated before the physical arrival of the truck at the border. The experience of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   19&#13;
&amp;#12;Border Crossing Monitoring along the Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Northern Corridor also shows that evolving processes may result in the sup-&#13;
pression of stages. As a consequence, it is no longer possible to assume that the&#13;
duration of a process recorded only as a milestone can be obtained by difference&#13;
with the end of the previous stage. It therefore becomes necessary to record both&#13;
the beginning and the end of a specific stage, and dissociate the physical move-&#13;
ments from the documentation.&#13;
&#13;
The physical movements are decomposed into three main stages: arrival at the&#13;
border, physical crossing of the border line, and finally departure from the border.&#13;
The arrival of the truck is recorded when the truck is reaching the border area,&#13;
either when it is reaching the queue (if there is a queue) or when it is parking while&#13;
waiting to join the queue for the border formalities. With this convention, the ac-&#13;
tual waiting time of the truck is recorded and can be isolated from the border-&#13;
crossing process itself. The departure time recorded is the actual time when the&#13;
truck resumes its journey. With this convention, it is possible to measure the time&#13;
the driver spends at the border after the completion of all formalities.&#13;
&#13;
In the three borders surveyed on the Northern Corridor, the distance between the&#13;
two customs areas is short, at most 500m in the case of Gatuna / Katuna. There is&#13;
therefore no need to record departing time from one side and arrival time to the&#13;
other side.&#13;
&#13;
The documentation process is more complex, and individual stages for the follow-&#13;
up of the documentation can be of two types:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Simple events, such as handover of documents from driver to agent, for&#13;
          instance. In that case, only the time of the event is recorded&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Processes with a duration, such as customs checks. In that case, both&#13;
          times (for the beginning and for the end) are recorded&#13;
&#13;
The sequence for each side of the border for the documents is as follows, as a rule:&#13;
     1.   The driver remits the documents to the agent&#13;
&#13;
     2.   The agent submits the declaration to customs with supporting documents&#13;
&#13;
     3.   Customs declaration process (begin and end)&#13;
     4.   Additional customs and other border agencies checks (begin and end)&#13;
&#13;
     5.   Release of the truck by the agent once all formalities are completed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          Choke monitoring methodology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is a growing recognition that customs are no longer necessarily the main&#13;
constraint at the border, and there is a need to clearly identify the role of the other&#13;
agencies. To achieve this, it is necessary to record whether other agencies have in-&#13;
tervened on the crossing and obtain the respective time stamps for their interven-&#13;
tion(s). However, in the case of the Northern Corridor, this was not considered as&#13;
critical based on the results of the preparatory phase, and the role of other border&#13;
management agencies is not identified in the survey form. All border agencies oth-&#13;
er than customs are lumped into the inspection cells of the form, together with&#13;
customs physical checks.&#13;
&#13;
Border management agencies interventions are clearly identified at the beginning&#13;
and end of the process, with observation of the customs on each side of the border,&#13;
as well as customs and other border agencies checks on each side of the border.&#13;
&#13;
The time attributed to clearing agents is, for each side, the sum of the time taken to&#13;
submit the documents once they have been received from the driver and the time&#13;
between the end of the checks or processes and the release of the driver.&#13;
&#13;
Time attributed to the driver is the addition of the time between interventions,&#13;
which is actually a combination of voluntary periods of waiting time, but also&#13;
some delays over which drivers have no control. A typical example of such delay is&#13;
when the truck arrives at night and must wait for the clearing agent office to open.&#13;
&#13;
Pre-arrival section&#13;
&#13;
The section on pre-arrival obstacles is the result of an attempt to collect additional&#13;
information on road transport constraints, notably on road blocks and weigh-&#13;
bridges, and the delays they generate.&#13;
&#13;
Exploiting that information proved to be difficult for two reasons. The major one&#13;
is that the sample is not constructed to ensure statistical validity of the results of&#13;
this survey. The second reason is that responses purely rely on the memory of the&#13;
driver, which makes them more an indication of the perception of the nuisance&#13;
caused by check points and weighbridges.&#13;
&#13;
In future, this section should be deleted from the surveys. If collecting information&#13;
on delays â&#128;&#152;en routeâ&#128;&#153; to the border is a critical issue (revealed by the other transport&#13;
observatory indicators or signaled by logistics operators), another type of survey&#13;
should be considered. For instance, experiments in Southern Africa and in Eastern&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    21&#13;
&amp;#12;Border Crossing Monitoring along the Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Africa to utilize GPS tracking data to identify the location and the duration of the&#13;
stops along the road appear to be more suitable for this analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Practical organization of the survey&#13;
&#13;
The consultant TLC recruited and trained a team of qualified local assistants with&#13;
experience in clearing and forwarding for the data collection work, two per border&#13;
post between Kenya and Uganda, and one for Katuna/Gatuna (due to lower vol-&#13;
ume of vehicles and faster crossing times).&#13;
&#13;
For the Kenya-Uganda borders, one assistant was deployed for each side of the&#13;
border. Coordination between the two was ensured through communication&#13;
equipment, to ensure that the selected trucks were observed during a complete&#13;
crossing. In addition, one coordinator was recruited for each border to supervise&#13;
the monitoring activities and capture the survey forms for analysis.&#13;
&#13;
The monitoring sheets were captured in Excel tables, and processed to calculate&#13;
differences in times to measure the duration of significant steps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Presentation of results: averages, deviation and frequency distributions&#13;
&#13;
An important question is what is the relevant indicator to consider for the presen-&#13;
tation of the results? Using the average is usual, but at the same time highly mis-&#13;
leading. To avoid oversimplification by just using the average, the standard devia-&#13;
tion is frequently added to qualify the average.&#13;
&#13;
This may be sufficient when the times are short, but the combination of several&#13;
successive or parallel processes over an extended period of time produces complex&#13;
frequency distributions (refer for instance to Figure 14).&#13;
&#13;
To illustrate how misleading the average can be, one can consider crossing times at&#13;
the end of 2011 in Malaba, in the outbound direction. The average duration of the&#13;
border crossing was 24 hours as shown in Figure 2. However the frequency distri-&#13;
bution for the same period in Figure 4 shows that containers were either crossing&#13;
the border in 12 hours or less, or in 36 hours or more, and very rarely between&#13;
those two values. Very few crossed the border in around 24 hours. The situation is&#13;
practically identical for break bulk trucks. In that situation, the average corre-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Choke monitoring methodology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
sponds to a situation which practically never occurs. This is generally the case&#13;
when the duration of the process extends over longer than 24 hours.&#13;
&#13;
A more relevant indicator for this type of situation would be for instance the pro-&#13;
portion of trucks crossing the border on the same day. Applied to Malaba, this&#13;
type of indicator translates the improvement in the border-crossing conditions, as&#13;
used in the Malaba section:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;&#156;Before the change in procedures, 60 percent of the containers and half of&#13;
    the break bulk trucks were crossing in 48 hours or more. After the change,&#13;
    all trucks but one passed the border in less than 6 hoursâ&#128;?.&#13;
&#13;
On the contrary, when the distribution is simpler, for shorter processes, for in-&#13;
stance a few hours, the average and the standard deviation are sufficiently repre-&#13;
sentative of the distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability of the border crossing surveys&#13;
&#13;
The decision to undertake the border crossing surveys on the Northern Corridor&#13;
was made originally to establish a baseline to which future crossing times will be&#13;
compared after the conversion of the border posts into an OSBP. In that context,&#13;
the need to measure the actual impact of that conversion justified the cost of or-&#13;
ganizing a dedicated survey, but routine monitoring of border delays, alternative&#13;
and more sustainable options need to be considered.&#13;
&#13;
Several other options have been explored, with pros and cons, tapping into exist-&#13;
ing computerized sources that would eliminate the cost of generating the data,&#13;
which is the main cost component of the surveys:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Automated customs systems record not only the content of the declara-&#13;
         tions, but also the time stamps associated to its process&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    An increasing number of road transport enterprises are managing their&#13;
         fleets with GPS tracking, generating a wealth of information on the&#13;
         movements of the trucks&#13;
&#13;
In theory, extracting durations from customs automated systems is possible, but&#13;
border crossing surveys conducted on several corridors throughout Africa con-&#13;
firmed that the customs processing time represents only a minor fraction of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 23&#13;

&#13;
time spent at the borders. Customs data, however, remains essential to monitor&#13;
volumes and vehicle counts.&#13;
&#13;
In the specific case of Malaba, the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) has devel-&#13;
oped a computerized registry of truck arrivals and departures linking vehicle&#13;
movements to the declarations, named CURES (Customs Reconciliation System).&#13;
Using this system, the authorities are able to keep track of trucks and cargo enter-&#13;
ing and leaving the control zone. For the time being, the monitoring covers only&#13;
the Uganda side of the border, but its extension to the Kenya side is planned. This&#13;
could be an example to follow, particularly in the context where transformation of&#13;
the border posts includes physical upgrade of the border facilities. Including a re-&#13;
cording system at the entry and exit gates of the facility would provide compre-&#13;
hensive information on the duration of the crossing on a routine basis.&#13;
&#13;
Alternatively, pending the generalization of gate registration, the alternative for&#13;
monitoring truck physical movements is to access GPS tracking data, either from&#13;
the road transport companies or directly from the GPS tracking service providers.&#13;
This was piloted on the Chirundu border post by TMSA, enabling the measure of&#13;
the border crossing characteristics of a large pool of trucks. However, in the ab-&#13;
sence of contextual data on the characteristics of the consignment (notably, nature&#13;
of the good, type of load, and nature of the trade), this information is primarily&#13;
aimed at routine monitoring, in order to trigger further investigation when ab-&#13;
normal situations occur.&#13;

Border post facilities and procedures&#13;
&#13;
At Malaba, the two customs areas are just separated by a bridge. Besides immigra-&#13;
tion and customs, several other border agencies are represented. On the Kenya&#13;
side, those include:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Ministry of Health&#13;
    ï&#130;§    KEPHIS (Kenya Plant Health Inspection Services, Department of Agri-&#13;
         culture)&#13;
    ï&#130;§    KEBS (Kenya Bureau of Standards)&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Kenya Police&#13;
&#13;
Only customs and immigration agencies are operating on 24/7 basis. For customs,&#13;
the decision to operate 24/7 was taken in November 2008. Other border agencies&#13;
operate from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, and do not presently have sufficient staff at the&#13;
border to open extended hours.&#13;
&#13;
The border is very busy, with over 600 trucks per day crossing to Uganda, and over&#13;
450 to Kenya, on a daily average.&#13;
&#13;
There are infrastructure constraints at the border which impact the conditions of&#13;
the crossings. The access road is narrow, and trucks are obliged to queue according&#13;
to their arrival, irrespective of the priority treatment which can be granted accord-&#13;
ing to commodities (for instance, tanker trucks are supposed to proceed directly to&#13;
the exit customs yard). The bridge between the two customs area is also narrow,&#13;
and only one truck can cross at a time.&#13;
&#13;
The customs procedure differs according to the destination of the goods:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    For goods in transit through Kenya and destined to Uganda, clearing and&#13;
         forwarding agents (C&amp;F) must clear the goods at the border&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                  25&#13;
&amp;#12;Border Crossing Monitoring along the Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Goods transiting to another country (for instance Sudan, or Rwanda)&#13;
          must be declared in transit&#13;
&#13;
The RADDEx system (Revenue Authority Digital Data Exchange) has been devel-&#13;
oped to enable C&amp;F agents in one country to pull the transit declaration from the&#13;
other customs management system to populate the transit or import declaration.&#13;
&#13;
A transit entry (for through transit) has 38 fields for information to be entered by&#13;
the clearing agent. However, the number of information fields to update is de-&#13;
creased to only three (C&amp;F agent, Bond in force, Value) when RADDEx is used.&#13;
&#13;
During the survey period, the process was modified with the aim of reducing the&#13;
total border crossing time:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Part of the customs entry process can be done in parallel with the exit&#13;
          process (pre-lodgment or simultaneous submission of document), with&#13;
          the documents already processed on the entry side while the truck is still&#13;
          physically on the exit side, which was introduced in December 2011&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Reducing the number of additional checks on goods&#13;
&#13;
Additional measures were taken to further reduce the delays, by preventing the&#13;
trucks to join the queue before their documents can be processed, and to prevent&#13;
them from remaining within the border area once the clearance is complete. Puni-&#13;
tive fines have been established and published by KRA on 21 February, 2012 to&#13;
enforce those decisions:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    No truck will allowed within 5 km of the customs entry gates. A penalty&#13;
          of US $1,000 will be imposed for transgressions as provided for under&#13;
          Section 15(4) of the East African Community Customs Management Act&#13;
          (EACCMA), 2004&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Fuel Trucks will move directly to the exit gates and none will not be al-&#13;
          lowed to join queues&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Only licensed clearing agents (a maximum of two per company) will be&#13;
          allowed to operate within the KRA border station premises&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Verification of cargo (where necessary), will be conducted by all govern-&#13;
          ment border agencies at the same time&#13;
&#13;

Survey findings&#13;
&#13;
Border crossing times. The combination of the facilitation measures and the pe-&#13;
nalization of longer stay of trucks at the border had a dramatic effect on the time&#13;
taken to cross the border over the survey period. Border crossing times have com-&#13;
plex distributions patterns. That pattern with peaks approximately every 24 hours&#13;
is frequent, as trucks are processed either within a window of a few hours corre-&#13;
sponding to the first peak, or until the next window, the following day.&#13;
&#13;
In both directions, the reduction of the crossing time translates into a higher pro-&#13;
portion of trucks released from the border much earlier than before, illustrated by&#13;
a shift to the left of the peak, which corresponds to the most frequent case.&#13;

Type of traffic and trucks. Due to the difference of process between through trans-&#13;
it and goods destined to Uganda, analysis of the border crossing times must distin-&#13;
guish the two cases for trucks moving towards the hinterland (outbound). Howev-&#13;
er, in the sample, there are only a handful of trucks corresponding to through&#13;
transit traffic, preventing significant analysis.&#13;
&#13;
In the opposite direction (towards Mombasa, inbound), there is a significant&#13;
number of trucks returning empty. However, empty trucks were not selected on&#13;
purpose, to increase the sample of loaded trucks, preventing the analysis of border&#13;
crossing times for empty trucks.&#13;
&#13;
Out of the initial five truck types targeted, only three were sufficiently represented,&#13;
container trucks and break bulk for both directions, and tankers outbound only.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Containers and consolidated trucks are generally loaded with a mix of goods, re-&#13;
quiring more complex declarations than homogeneous loads for tankers and break&#13;
bulk trucks. The logic would be that trucks with mixed loads would require longer&#13;
documentation process. Tanker trucks would be the fastest to clear the borders&#13;
due to the priority they benefit for security reasons, and break bulk trucks would&#13;
be in between.&#13;
&#13;
In practice, the border crossing times according to truck type illustrated in Figure&#13;
7 show a different picture for the end of 2011. However, the change of procedures&#13;
in 2012 resulted in a dramatic reduction of time and a convergence of the crossing&#13;
times, with practically no differences in the duration of the border crossings times&#13;
between the different truck types.&#13;
&#13;
Exit-entry country sides of the border. Exit procedures, which usually only involve&#13;
confirming the exit of the goods in transit, are lighter than entry procedures,&#13;
which involve a declaration and clearance for goods destined to the entry country.&#13;
Moreover, some trucks should proceed directly to the entry side, for instance&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
tanker trucks. Based on these two assumptions, the duration of the stay of trucks&#13;
on the exit side of the border should be shorter than the time on the entry side.&#13;
&#13;
Separating crossing times between the two countries reveals that those assump-&#13;
tions are erroneous. Trucks spend clearly more time on the exit side than on the&#13;
entry side. It is also important to note that tanker trucks do not spend a signifi-&#13;
cantly shorter time on the exit side, compared for instance to break bulk.&#13;

In the inbound direction (towards Mombasa), the implementation of the amend-&#13;
ed procedures were delayed by one month. The first period corresponds to the first&#13;
three months of the survey, November to January, and the second period to the&#13;
last two months, February and March. The reduction of crossing times in that di-&#13;
rection is of the same order of importance than for outbound traffic.&#13;

Focusing on the interventions of the border management agencies (customs and&#13;
others), Figure 10 shows that the physical checks have almost completely disap-&#13;
peared, and customs document process improved drastically.&#13;
&#13;
One of the decisions by customs was to impose fines to trucks remaining within&#13;
border area after the completion of the clearance. The survey shows that delays&#13;
after completion have increased rather than decreased, while the main portion of&#13;
driver idle time shifted to the end of the process.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The most probable explanation for this is that drivers were able to conduct their&#13;
 â&#128;&#152;private affairsâ&#128;&#153; in parallel to the intervention of the border management agencies&#13;
 or upon arrival, while the new procedures leave far less time to do so. They proba-&#13;
 bly need the additional time after the completion of the procedures to finish their&#13;
 own business. The perception by customs that trucks are idling at the border after&#13;
 the end of formalities is linked to this increase, which motivated the decision to&#13;
 impose fines.&#13;

Busia is less busy than Malaba, with a daily average of 210 trucks crossing to&#13;
Uganda, but only 30 crossing to Kenya, as indicated in Table 2. In Malaba, the&#13;
proportion of loaded trucks crossing from Uganda to Kenya is around 75 percent,&#13;
based on Revenue Authority data. That proportion is much lower, around 15 per-&#13;
cent for Busia, indicating that Malaba is the preferred crossing point for return&#13;
trips, a pattern which had been confirmed by several trucking enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
The customs area is located inside the town, and trucks are passing through town&#13;
before reaching the border. The road is lined with shops and there is practically no&#13;
parking space. Within the customs area, there is limited parking space on the Ken-&#13;
ya side, and even less on the Uganda side.&#13;

Border crossing times. Border crossing times at Busia did not significantly change&#13;

     Considering the overall duration of the border crossings inbound, dropping to an&#13;
     average of 30 minutes, no detailed analysis was conducted for this direction. The&#13;
     low traffic in that direction is most probably the reason for the short duration of&#13;

     Type of traffic and trucks. In Busia, the truck sample is relatively balanced be-&#13;

However, a closer analysis shows that most of it occurs between the arrival at the&#13;
border and the remittance of the documents to the agent, and that duration is&#13;
closely linked to the arrival time itself.&#13;

&#13;
When the driver arrives at the border early morning hours, the delay corresponds&#13;
to the wait until operating hours for the agent to commence work, a pattern which&#13;
occurs also for late arrivals. The delays are clearly linked to agent operating hours&#13;
and not the result of a choice by the drivers. Comparatively, delays after clearance&#13;
are minimal, 8 minutes on average.&#13;

Gatuna / Katuna border post&#13;
&#13;
Border post facilities and procedures&#13;
&#13;
The distance between the two border posts is around 500m, and the border oper-&#13;
ates 24/7.&#13;
&#13;
On the Uganda side of the border, there are only two other border agencies based&#13;
at Gatuna/Katuna border post and are listed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§      Plant Health Inspectorate (Department of Agriculture)&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§      Uganda Bureau of Standards&#13;
&#13;
These agencies operate during daylight hours from 08:00 am to 17:00 pm, which is&#13;
contrary to customs that operates 24/7.&#13;
&#13;
The border is moderately busy, with an average of 80 trucks in each direction per&#13;
day, and not saturated, according to figures in Table 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 35&#13;
&amp;#12;Border Crossing Monitoring along the Northern Corridor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recently, Gatuna has been trying to introduce an OSBP concept by stationing a&#13;
customs officer from the opposing revenue authority within the offices of the&#13;
counter border to try and speed up the clearing process and reduce transit times.&#13;
&#13;
Survey findings&#13;
&#13;
Border crossing times. In the presentation of the preliminary survey results to the&#13;
Northern Corridor stakeholders, trucking enterprises confirmed they considered&#13;
Gatuna as an efficient border: on average, it takes three hours to clear the border&#13;
in the outbound direction, although it takes longer in the opposite direction.&#13;

Type of traffic and trucks. At the Gatuna border, containerized trucks are the most&#13;
frequent type of truck in the sample. Only small numbers of consolidated and re-&#13;
frigerated loads were recorded. The sample includes empty crossings in the in-&#13;
bound direction.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The trade patterns at Gatuna are more complex than for the Kenya-Uganda bor-&#13;
der posts, for which two types of trade were possible (external trade of Uganda or&#13;
through transit). The possible combinations are:&#13;
&#13;
              ï&#130;§    Bilateral trade Uganda-Rwanda&#13;
&#13;
              ï&#130;§    Maritime transit to Rwanda&#13;
              ï&#130;§    Through transit&#13;
&#13;
              ï&#130;§    Uganda trade with neighboring countries transiting through Rwanda&#13;
&#13;
All cases are included in the sample, which reveals a large proportion of regional&#13;
trade (categories Uganda trade, and bilateral), as opposed to international transit&#13;
(categories through transit and transit to Rwanda)&#13;
&#13;

Exit country / Entry country side of the border. As explained in the corresponding&#13;
section for the Malaba border, trucks with mixed loads would be expected to have&#13;
slower crossing times than homogeneous loads and tankers, which should be re-&#13;
leased quickly because of the hazards associated with petroleum products,. The&#13;
respective time spent on each side of the border at Gatuna is more in line with&#13;
what would be expected from an OSCP, with an exit process shorter than entry&#13;
procedures, but crossing time for tankers takes longer than for other types of load.&#13;

            Border crossing monitoring along the
            northern corridor
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Border-crossing times in East Africa
            have been identified as a major constraint for smooth trade
            flows, both for regional trade and for international
            transit. Delays at borders disrupt efficient trade
            logistics, impacting on the transport costs and prices, and
            ultimately on trade competitiveness. In order to improve the
            efficiency of border crossings in East Africa, the East
            Africa Community (EAC) has resolved to convert the main
            border crossings into a Stop Border Post (OSBP), in which
            all border agencies from the two sides of the border
            coordinate their interventions, thus reducing documentation
            processing time. This program is supported by several
            multilateral and bilateral donors as component of their
            assistance to regional integration in the EAC. The paper is
            divided into four sections. The first section provides
            background information on the Northern Corridor. The second
            section presents the conclusions that can be drawn from the
            survey, presented in the Northern Corridor context with the
            key issues that will require further discussion among
            stakeholders and further action. From a wider perspective,
            this section also emphasizes the shift of relative
            importance that should be attributed to the hard and the
            soft agendas of border crossings based on the analysis of
            the impact of the changes at the Malaba border post.
