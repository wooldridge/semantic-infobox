Bleirn WlAUlen ius    In August 1999 the Moroccan government awarded a second mobile telecommunications license&#13;
and Carlo          through international tender. All bidders made commitments on quality, coverage, and tariffs that&#13;
Alaria Rossotto&#13;
would significantly expand and improve telecommunications services. The winning bidder was Medi&#13;
Telecom, a consortium of Telef6nica of Spain, Portugal Telecom, and Moroccan investors. Medi&#13;
Telecom paid about USS1.1 billion for the fifteen-year license to operate under relatively unfettered&#13;
competition-one of the highest prices ever paid for a mobile license relative to population size. Just&#13;
as impressive is that the price was offered in a country not usually on the radar screen of foreign&#13;
investors. The fiscal and development impact will be far reaching. The strong competition from&#13;
reputable bidders was the payoff to Morocco's decision to set up a credible, pro-competitive&#13;
regulatory environment before the transaction and to conduct open, professional bidding for the&#13;
license. This Note examines why Morocco was able to reap these big rewards.&#13;
The liberalization of Morocco's telecommlunica-&#13;
tions sector formally began with the Parliament's&#13;

            Introducing telecommunications competition
            through a wireless license : lessons from Morocco
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In August 1999 the Moroccan government
            awarded a second mobile telecommunications license through
            international tender. All bidders made commitments on
            quality, coverage, and tariffs that would significantly
            expand and improve telecommunications services. The winning
            bidder, Medi Telecom, paid about US$1.1 billion for the
            fifteen-year license to operate under relatively unfettered
            competition-one of the highest prices ever paid for a mobile
            license relative to population size. Just as impressive is
            that the price was offered in a country usually off the
            radar screen of foreign investors. This Note examines why
            Morocco was able to reap these big rewards.
