Nevertheless, the level of teacher attrition among&#13;
CTP teachers remains high. Attrition has been par-&#13;
ticularly high (about 18 percent) among female con-&#13;
tract teachers from the south who were deployed in&#13;
the northern part of the country, particularly when&#13;
deployed to the ZEP and rural areas, where life con-&#13;
ditions for young and educated teachers are difficult.&#13;
Attrition has also occurred as contract teachers have&#13;
migrated to other ministries after being registered&#13;
as civil servants in the Ministry of Basic Education.&#13;

&#13;
In addition to wide regional disparities, there are wide&#13;
differences within regions, with a pronounced urban/&#13;
rural divide. High overall pupil-teacher ratios in the&#13;
northern regions mask the fact that certain, mainly&#13;
urban areas, exhibit relatively moderate PTRs while&#13;
in some remote rural areas there is only one teacher       students can write in them requires new books to&#13;

sub-divisions with the highest and the lowest pupil-       from publishers has been reported forcing Ministries&#13;

primary and secondary education cycles through                  books would need to be addressed. In order to make&#13;
high-stakes exams. Cameroon has participated in                 a Government-financed system feasible, textbooks&#13;

            Revisiting the sources of growth : the
            quality of basic education
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Cameroon economic updates aim at
            sharing knowledge and stimulating debate among those
            interested in improving the economic management of Cameroon
            and unleashing its enormous potential. The notes thereby
            offer another voice on economic issues in Cameroon, and an
            additional platform for engagement, learning, and exchange.
            The average observed economic growth rate from 2010 to 2013
            is a mere four percent, one percentage point below the
            vision 2035 targets. Achieving the official objectives set
            for 2020 will require Cameroon to move to double digit
            annual growth rates over the 2014-2020 period, compared to
            the 4.8 to 5.4 percent projected by the World Bank. This
            report looks at the quality of basic education to ensure
            that the right investments are made in people to build human
            capital, a key ingredient for sustainable economic growth.
            Cameroon has achieved significant progress over the last
            decade in expanding access to basic education. The number of
            students completing primary school, the primary completion
            rate, rose from 53 percent in 2001 to about 80 percent in
            2011. The improvements in access to education also mask
            significant differences in education performance across and
            within individual regions, as well as between gender and
            income groups. The economic update suggests improving data
            collection in order to better monitor education service
            provision, assess more systematically student learning,
            increase in budget allocation to education as a whole,
            reprioritize public spending to the zones d'education
            prioritaires (Education Priority Zones) (ZEPs), ensure
            transparency in budget allocation, and revisit the textbook
            policy to ensure durability and affordability.
