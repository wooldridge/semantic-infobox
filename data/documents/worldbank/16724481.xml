the benefit-cost ratios for such facilities.                                             pecially important in situations where funds for sanitation&#13;
                                                                                         improvements are scarce. Third, the cost effectiveness ratios&#13;
The study also estimated cost-effectiveness indicators which                             of toilets in urban areas that are subject to off-site treatment&#13;
are mainly focused on the health impacts of the sanitation                               are lower than toilets with access to septic tanks which are&#13;
options. Figure B summarizes the key results using the costs                             not desludged. This finding strengthens the case for off-site&#13;
for each disability life year (DALY) averted from each op-                               treatment in urban areas. Fourth, the results reinforce the&#13;
tion. It indicates that the lowest costs per health unit gained                          widely held belief that the viability of a sanitation option&#13;

ral and urban areas, respectively. It also shows that costs                              ported by the differences in the efficiency indicators across&#13;
per DALY averted are lower for toilets with access to septic                             rural and urban areas. The differences are even more pro-&#13;
tanks compared to UDDT-E facilities. In the case of urban                                nounced in the study sites. For example, the benefit-cost&#13;
households, cost per DALY falls further, relative to toilets                             ratio for septic tanks in Alabel is 2.8 versus 5.6 in Taguig.&#13;
with access to septic tanks that are not desludged, with the                             The difference can also be partially accounted for by the&#13;
introduction of off-site treatment facilities.                                           higher income level of Taguig residents which tends to raise&#13;
                                                                                         the opportunity costs from poor sanitation.&#13;
The implications of the results above are as follows: First, it&#13;
pays to invest in sanitation improvements. All interventions                             The results presented above were conducted under ideal set-&#13;
for all the sites had gains that exceed investment and recur-                            tings; i.e., these do not account for actual conditions and&#13;
rent costs. Second, low-cost sanitation options, i.e., wet and                           practices in the study sites. Accounting for these factors&#13;
dry pit latrines, deliver relatively high economic benefits for                          led to efficiency indicators that were slightly less favorable&#13;

    Second, reuse was more prevalent in upland areas. In the&#13;

  benefits of improved sanitation in selected rural and urban&#13;
  locations, as well as to enable a better understanding of the&#13;
  overall national level impacts of improving sanitation cov-&#13;
  erage in the Philippines. On the cost side, decision makers&#13;
  and stakeholders need to understand more about the timing&#13;
  and size of costs (e.g., investment, operation, maintenance),&#13;
  as well as financial versus non-financial costs, in order to&#13;
  make the appropriate investment decision that increases in-&#13;
  tervention effectiveness and sustainability. On the benefit&#13;
  side, the monetary as well as non-monetary impacts need&#13;
  to be more fully understood in advocating for improved&#13;
  sanitation as well as making the optimal sanitation choice.&#13;
  For cost-benefit estimations, a sample of sites representing&#13;
  different contexts of the Philippines was selected to assess&#13;
  efficiency of sanitation interventions, and thus illustrate the&#13;
  range and sizes of sanitation costs and benefits.&#13;
&#13;
  The research under this program is being conducted in&#13;
  Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines,&#13;
  and Vietnam. Similar studies are also ongoing in selected&#13;
  South Asian, African and Latin American countries.&#13;
&#13;
  While WSP has supported the development of this study,&#13;
  it is an â&#128;&#156;initiativeâ&#128;? in the broadest sense, which includes&#13;

&amp;#12;  Glossary&#13;
        Benefit-cost ratio (BCR): the ratio of the present value of the stream of benefits to the present value of the&#13;
        stream of costs. The higher the BCR the more efficient the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
        Cost per case averted: the discounted value of the costs for each case of a disease that is avoided because&#13;
        of an intervention.&#13;
&#13;
        Cost per DALY averted: the discounted value of the costs for each DALY that is avoided because of an&#13;
        intervention.&#13;
&#13;
        Cost per death averted: the discounted value of the costs for each death that is avoided because of an&#13;
        intervention.&#13;
&#13;
        Cost-effectiveness ratio (CER): the ratio of the present value of the future costs to the present value of&#13;
        the future health benefits in non-monetary units (cases, deaths, disability-adjusted life-years). The lower&#13;
        the CER the more efficient the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
        Disability-Adjusted Life-Year (DALY): a measurement of the gap between current health status and an&#13;
        ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability.&#13;
        One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of â&#128;&#156;healthyâ&#128;? life (WHO 2010).&#13;
&#13;
        Ecological sanitation (EcoSan): a new paradigm in sanitation that recognizes human excreta and water&#13;
        from households not as waste but as resources that can be recovered, treated where necessary and safely&#13;
        used again. It is based on the systematic implementation of reuse and recycling of nutrients and water as a&#13;
        hygienically safe, closed-loop and holistic alternative to conventional sanitation solutions (GTZ 2009).&#13;
&#13;
        Improved sanitation: the use of the following facilities in home compounds: flush/pour-flush to&#13;
        piped sewer system/septic tank/pit latrine, ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine, pit latrine with slab, or&#13;
        composting toilet (JMP 2008).&#13;
&#13;
        Shared sanitation facilities: sanitation facilities of an otherwise acceptable type shared between two or&#13;
        more households. Only facilities that are not shared or not public are considered improved (JMP 2008).&#13;
&#13;
        Open defecation: the practice of disposing human feces in fields, forests, bushes, open bodies of water,&#13;
        beaches or other open spaces or disposed of with solid waste (JMP 2008).&#13;
&#13;
        Intangible benefits: Benefits of improved sanitation which are difficult to quantify. These include impacts&#13;
        on the quality of life, comfort, security, dignity, personal and cultural preferences, among others.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                     Internal rate of return (IRR): the discount rate for which the present value of the stream of net benefits is&#13;
                     zero. In other words, the discount rate for which the BCR equals unity (1).&#13;
&#13;
                     Net benefit: the difference between the present value of the stream of benefits and the present value of the&#13;
                     stream of costs.&#13;
&#13;
                     Net present value (NPV): the discounted value of the current and future stream of net benefits from a&#13;
                     project.&#13;
&#13;
                     Payback period (PBB): represents the number of periods (e.g., years) that are necessary to recover the&#13;
                     costs incurred for a project.&#13;
&#13;
                     Sewage: water-borne human or animal wastes removed from residences, buildings, institutions, industrial&#13;
                     and commercial establishments together with groundwater, surface water and storm water. Liquid and&#13;
                     solid waste carried off in sewers or drains.&#13;
&#13;
                     Septage: The sludge produced on individual onsite wastewater-disposal systems, principally septic tanks&#13;
                     and cesspools. The contents of septic tanks.&#13;
&#13;
                     Sewerage: A network of pipelines, ditches, channels including pumping stations and force mains, service&#13;
                     connections including other devices for the collection, transport, and treatment of sewage.&#13;
&#13;
                     Strategic sanitation: a concept based on the following principles (Rosenweig and Perez 2002):&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Ensuring that any plan to improve sanitation services is financially sustainable&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Consulting households to understand what sanitation solutions are in use and what expectations people&#13;
                           have&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Using a public consultation process with stakeholders to discuss the options&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Including a specific health component to maximize health benefits&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Selecting an appropriate model for managing the provision of sanitation services to ensure sustainability&#13;
&#13;
                     Unimproved sanitation: the use of the following facilities anywhere: flush/pour flush without isolation or&#13;
                     treatment, pit latrine without slab/open pit, bucket, hanging toilet/hanging latrine, use of a public facility&#13;
                     or sharing any improved facility, no facilities, bush or field (open defecation) (JMP 2008).&#13;

     The Economics of Sanitation Initiative was conducted in Cambodia, China (Yunnan Province), Indonesia,&#13;
     Lao PDR, the Philippines and Vietnam. The study was led by the East Asia and and the Pacific Office&#13;
     of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), with the contribution of WSP teams and&#13;
     consultants in each of the participating countries. The study took two years to complete, and has&#13;
     undergone several major peer review processes.&#13;
&#13;
     Guy Hutton (WSP Senior Water and Sanitation Economist and Task Team Leader) led the development&#13;
     of the concept and methodology for the ESI, the management and coordination of the country teams, and&#13;
     provision of regional tools and templates. Bjorn Larsen contributed to the development of generic data&#13;
     collection tools and the health methodology. The study benefited from the continuous support of other&#13;
     WSP staff: Almud Weitz, Isabel Blackett, Yosa Yuliarsa, Irvan Tjondronegoro, Martin Albrecht and WSP&#13;

                    country teams. In addition, peer reviewers from ESI Phase 1 are thanked for their valuable inputs which&#13;
                    carried over to Phase 2 (see Acknowledgments in Phase 1 study).&#13;
&#13;
                    The ESI has been financed by the regional component of the Sustainable Sanitation in East Asia (SUSEA)&#13;
                    program, which is funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). The Asian&#13;
                    Development Bank (ADB) co-financed the consultant teams in Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.&#13;
                    The study in Yunnan Province (China) was co-financed by the USAIDâ&#128;&#153;s ECO-Asia program. WSP and the&#13;
                    report authors are grateful to the funding agencies for their support.&#13;

The Philippines has made substantial progress in increas-&#13;
ing the access of its people to improved sanitation. Re-                                   Figure 1 provides information on sanitation coverage for&#13;
cent estimates from the Joint Monitoring Programme for                                     the different regions of the Philippines. It indicates that the&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of the World Health                                      National Capital Region (NCR), Ilocos, and Central Luzon&#13;
Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s                                       had the highest proportions of households with access to&#13;
Fund (UNICEF) indicate that 76% of the population of                                       improved sanitation facilities in 2007. In contrast, the Au-&#13;
the country had access to improved sanitation facilities in                                tonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) lagged&#13;
2008 (Table 1).1 This is a significant improvement from the                                behind the other regions, with only about 51% of its house-&#13;
58% that was estimated in 1990. Moreover, the propor-                                      holds having access to improved sanitation facilities. The&#13;
tion of the population who practice open defecation was                                    estimates also indicate double-digit increases in the propor-&#13;
halved over the same period from 16% in 1990 to 8% in                                      tion of families with access to improved sanitation in all&#13;
2008. The Philippines is clearly well on its way to achieving                              regions between 2000 and 2007. The largest gains ranged&#13;
the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of reducing by                                       from 13 percentage points in the Southern Mindanao to&#13;
half the proportion of its population in 1990 who did not                                  25 percentage points in the ARMM. As a result, there was&#13;
have access to improved sanitation facilities.                                             a narrower gap between the regions in terms of access to&#13;
                                                                                           improved sanitation in 2007 compared to 2000.&#13;
Another positive development is the dramatic increase in&#13;
the access to improved sanitation in rural areas. As of 2008,                              Two common patterns emerge from the analysis of second-&#13;
69% of rural households had access to improved sanitation.                                 ary data. First, there have been noticeable improvements in&#13;
This was 23 percentage points higher than its counterpart                                  sanitation coverage over the last decade and a half. Second,&#13;
for 1990. While access to improved sanitation in urban ar-                                 the gap in terms of access to improved sanitation facilities&#13;
eas was still higher by 11 percentage points, the gap be-                                  across regions has narrowed over the same period.&#13;

  The JMP (2008) defines an improved sanitation facility â&#128;&#156;as one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contactâ&#128;? (p.39). This includes flush or pour-flush&#13;
latrines connected to a piped sewer system, septic tank or pit latrine and ventilated improved pit latrine. On the other hand, unimproved facilities include pit latrines&#13;
without slab or platform, hanging latrines, and bucket latrines. Pour-flush toilets that discharge into open drains, ditches or other bodies of water and facilities shared by&#13;
two or more households are also considered unimproved.&#13;

also some uncertainty over the values being presented here.                           Policy makers in the Philippines recognize the importance&#13;
For example, the National Statistical Coordination Board                              of increasing access to improved sanitation. For example,&#13;
(2006) reported that 42% of all households in 2000 had                                Chapter 3 of the Medium-Term Development Plan 2004-&#13;

show that only 6.7% of urban households had toilets that                              also an array of laws and regulations which date as far back&#13;
flush to a sewage system. An even lower proportion (2.1%)                             as 1949 with the provision on the drainage of buildings in&#13;
was reported for rural households.                                                    the Civil Code of the Philippines (RA 386). More recent&#13;

    At present, many government agencies are tasked with ad-                            investments to the sector. To date, the most comprehen-&#13;
    dressing sanitation problems in the country. These include                          sive analysis of costs of poor sanitation in the Philippines is&#13;
    the Department of Health (DOH), Department of Envi-                                 the ESI Impacts Study (Rodriguez et al. 2008). The study&#13;

    tion, the existing set-up makes it harder to formulate and&#13;

    sized by Dr. Jaime Galvez Tan, former Secretary of Health                           various technologies with a specific option. For example,&#13;
    and Team Leader for the Technical Assistance Management                             Santos et al. (2007) and Partnerships in Environment&#13;

    at the Second Sanitation Summit in Manila in 2008, he                               evaluated various wastewater treatment technologies. On&#13;
    raised the question of â&#128;&#156;Who is in charge?â&#128;?â&#128;&#147; referring to the                        the other hand, the Netherlands Water Partnership (NWP&#13;
    absence of a lead agency for initiatives in the improvement                         2006) compared the costs of three types of urine diversion&#13;

    The discussion above asserts two points. First, the costs of                        There are also a few studies which attempted a cost-benefit&#13;

1.3	 The Road Ahead&#13;
One method that can be used to evaluate various sanitation&#13;
options is cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The objective of the&#13;
technique is to generate a monetary measure of the stream&#13;
of benefits and costs from an investment project or policy.&#13;
It can estimate the (a) expected economic return (return&#13;
per US$ invested), (b) net present value, and (c) the in-&#13;
ternal rate of return of investments or policy initiatives. It&#13;
therefore aids decision-makers in identifying whether the&#13;
net benefits from a project or policy are positive or negative.&#13;
In the presence of multiple options, a CBA may provide a&#13;
valuable input for priority setting.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis is important in enhancing the chances that&#13;
scarce resources are efficiently allocated to projects that pro-&#13;
vide acceptable levels of net benefits. Moreover, it also helps&#13;
evaluate the costs, budget impacts and benefits of sanita-&#13;
tion alternatives, should additional funds become available&#13;
to finance further investments. Furthermore, the analysis&#13;
provides information that can be used for advocacy of de-&#13;
velopment interventions, assuming CBA findings are favor-&#13;
able for the evaluated interventions.&#13;
&#13;
The remainder of this report is organized as follows: Chap-&#13;
ter 2 describes the overall objectives and aims of the study.&#13;
It also explains some of the key research questions that will&#13;
be addressed in subsequent chapters. Chapter 3 discusses&#13;
the methodology of the study. It describes the costs and&#13;
benefits to be evaluated and the key indicators used in the&#13;
analysis of the various options. The chapter also describes&#13;
the study sites and data collection methods. Chapter 4 pres-&#13;
ents the local or site-specific benefits associated with im-&#13;
proved sanitation while Chapter 5 describes some of the&#13;
broader benefits to the economy. Chapter 6 presents the&#13;
costs associated with various sanitation options. It also de-&#13;
scribes the costs as a household moves up the sanitation&#13;
ladder. Chapter 7 combines the information in Chapters 4&#13;
to 7 by way of a cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis.&#13;
It also compares the various efficiency indicators across vari-&#13;
ous sanitation options. Chapter 8 provides a discussion of&#13;
the results and Chapter 9 concludes with the recommenda-&#13;
tions of the study.&#13;

   VOSL studies attempt to value what individuals are willing to pay to reduce the risk of death (e.g., safety measures) willing to accept for an increase in the risk of&#13;
 death.These values are extracted either from observations of actual market and individual behavior (â&#128;&#156;hedonic pricingâ&#128;?) or from what individuals stated in relation to&#13;
 their preferences from interviews or written tests (â&#128;&#156;contingent valuationâ&#128;?). Both these approaches estimate directly the willingness to pay of individuals, or society, for a&#13;
 reduction in the risk of death, and hence are more closely associated with actual welfare loss compared with the HCA.&#13;

 3.4.4 NATIONAL HEALTH STATISTICS&#13;
 The field surveys provided data from the sampled house-&#13;
 holds and health facilities on disease incidence for selected&#13;
 diseases related to poor sanitation. For some sites, other&#13;
 studies conducted in the same locality provided alterna-&#13;
 tive sources of disease incidence data. However, constraints&#13;
 in data robustness at the field level requires supplementa-&#13;
 tion of these data with estimates on disease incidence and&#13;
 mortality rates from other sources, and adjustment to the&#13;
 health conditions of the specific field sites. Data were there-&#13;
 fore sourced from national surveys (e.g., Demographic and&#13;
 Health Survey) and research studies as well as internation-&#13;
 ally compiled statistics for the Philippines or the Southeast&#13;
 Asia region (World Health Organization; Disease Control&#13;
 Priorities Project 2). The data from these different sources&#13;
 were compared in terms of quality and applicability to the&#13;
 field sites, to finally select the most appropriate values for&#13;
 use in the cost-benefit analysis and the national health over-&#13;
 view.&#13;

 First, mortality costs are higher in rural sites. For children&#13;
 under the age of five years in the rural sites, the per capita                           1.0&#13;
 cost of mortality was about PhP1,305 (US$29). Roughly&#13;
 32% higher than its counterpart for urban areas, this was&#13;
 explained mostly by the higher mortality rates used in the                               0.8&#13;
 rural sites (see Table 7). Second, in the case of children un-&#13;
 der the age of five years, a large proportion of the costs are&#13;
 due to diarrheal diseases. Third, the highest costs are report-                          0.6&#13;
 ed for children under the age of five years. In rural sites for&#13;
 example, costs for this age group are more than ten times&#13;
 higher than the costs for the other age groups. This is due to                           0.4&#13;
 the high diarrheal incidence rate assumed for this age group&#13;
 and the fact that mortality costs associated with malaria and&#13;
 ALRI were not calculated for the other age groups.                                       0.2&#13;

    Coliform is a group of bacteria that may be vegetative or fecal in origin. E. coli is a species of coliform whose presence may be indicative of pollution from human or&#13;
 animal waste.&#13;
 18&#13;
    The Philippine National Standard for Drinking Water requires a total Coliform reading that is less than 1.1 MPN/100 ml.&#13;

As a whole, the test results presented above suggest that                                               assumed to have full isolation in the ideal analysis.20 Open&#13;
there is a lot of room for improvement in the quality of                                                defecation to water bodies represents no isolation. All other&#13;

large proportion of the water sources, including those used                                             contaminants that contribute to water pollution.&#13;
19&#13;
   These findings account for differences in the standard set for various water bodies. Class C refers to water bodies that may be used for fishing, recreational water use&#13;
(boating, etc.) and as industrial water supply. The requirements for class C are less stringent compared to class B type waters which are used for recreational activities such&#13;
as bathing and swimming. For more details about the water quality readings in the cities and the DENR standards, please see Annex Table C.1.&#13;
20&#13;
   The analysis assumes an ideal situation in which there is no leakage in the sewers and septic tanks. The extent to which these sanitation facilities can isolate&#13;
contaminants will of course be comprised if leakages exit.&#13;

 and water supply agencies can access cleaner water from                                ter. While the pattern is more or less the same for the rural&#13;
 different and more distant sources, thus increasing access                             and urban sites, two differences are worth noting. The first&#13;
 costs. Those who do not take precautionary measures are                                is that a larger proportion of households in the urban sites&#13;
 exposed to a higher risk of infectious disease, or poison-                             relied on bottled water. The second is the higher spending&#13;
 ing due to chemical content. Table 16 shows the household                              of urban households for each source. In the case of piped&#13;
 sources of drinking water and the average monthly water                                water, monthly expenditure was almost three times larger in&#13;
 source costs. It indicates that the largest source of water for                        the urban sites compared with the rural sites. Site-specific&#13;

 The relatively high level of satisfaction, especially among                             the respondents placed the highest priority on cleanliness&#13;

 The respondents were asked to rank a number of features                                 However, their preference for cleanliness came a very close&#13;

  The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC 2008) projected that in 2008 industries directly associated with tourism accounted for 4% and 3% of total&#13;

the estimates from a situation in which all the households&#13;

necessarily access to sewers) to half of the population that&#13;

business and tourism were not quantified in this study, the&#13;
benefits from improved sanitation could also be significant.&#13;

entitles households to empty their septic tanks on a regular five-year cycle. Households who do not have their septic tanks desludged at a pre-arranged time will have to&#13;
pay an additional fee of PhP900. Households that have access to sewer lines are charged an amount equal to 40% of their water bill.&#13;

 This study did not compare costs of the same sanitation                               ries of a relocation program who otherwise might not have&#13;
 options across income groups, but instead determined the                              had the access if not for the intervention. If Gawad Kalinga&#13;

 holds. Figure 52 shows the sanitation options for the differ-                         conclusion is that open defecation was the most common&#13;
 ent income groups in the rural sites. It indicates that a large                       practice among the members of income groups 1 and 2.&#13;
 proportion of the high income households (i.e., incomes&#13;
 over PhP20,000 per month or groups 4 and 5) had access                                The story does not differ much in the urban sites (Figure&#13;
 to at least a toilet that flushes to a septic tank. It also shows                     53). A large proportion of the high income households had&#13;
 that about half of the low income households (i.e., groups 1                          access to at least a toilet with a septic tank. In the group with&#13;
 and 2) had access to an STF or wastewater treatment. How-                             the lowest income, open defecation and community toilets&#13;
 ever, this finding must be interpreted with care because a                            were the most common options. While many households&#13;
 large proportion of the households in this group came from                            in the second income group still practiced open defecation&#13;

The information above provides some evidence that low in-                             five income groups in the study. Using the information on&#13;
come households tend to be located closer to the bottom                               investment or installation costs in the study, it shows that&#13;
of the sanitation ladder. Combined with earlier findings in                           such costs rise as a proportion of income as households se-&#13;

                                                                                      It is also important to note that some caution must be exer-&#13;
The observed pattern for all sites is also generally reflected                        cised in interpreting the incremental costs of moving from&#13;

cremental costs of moving from dry pits and onwards are                               tank in the rural sites. The reason is that there is no single&#13;

are negative. On the other hand, the incremental costs are                            likely to be severely compromised by inter-site price and&#13;

San Fernando facilitate a comparison with an urban setting                            urban areas, where space is also a constraint. However, there&#13;

 The findings for the urban-coastal regions of San Fernando,                                  As a whole, the study found that there were net benefits&#13;
 where only 20% of the UDDT-E users recycle waste, tend                                       for all the interventions considered in the sites. These were&#13;
 to defeat the key concept behind the approach.                                               shown by BCRs that are greater than unity and NPVs that&#13;

urbanized setting of Taguig. Low-cost sanitation options&#13;
also tend to have lower costs associated with given health&#13;
targets (cost-effectiveness ratios) and faster payback periods.&#13;
However, it is worth noting that the cost-effectiveness ratios&#13;
improve with the introduction of sewers and other treat-&#13;
ment facilities in dense urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
Efficiency indicators under actual settings tend to be less&#13;
favorable than under ideal settings. These were most notice-&#13;
able for facilities with multiple users â&#128;&#148; e.g., the STF in&#13;
Alabel and shared and community toilets in the urban sites.&#13;
All this emphasizes the need for the proper use and opera-&#13;
tion of such facilities.&#13;
&#13;
The net benefits calculated in the study might actually be&#13;
underestimated. Intangible benefits such as comfort, pres-&#13;
tige, and the personal safety of women and children were&#13;
not quantified in the analysis. Benefits which accrue out-&#13;
side of the household (national benefits) such as aesthet-&#13;
ics, tourism, business, and water (fisheries and other uses&#13;
of inland waters) were also excluded from the quantitative&#13;
analysis. Since these benefits might be more significant to&#13;
sanitation options at the top of the ladder â&#128;&#148; e.g., wastewa-&#13;
ter treatment and the benefits to inland waters â&#128;&#148; the net&#13;
gains from such interventions are higher than the values&#13;
estimated here.&#13;

 The key finding of the study is that there are net benefits as-    and therefore have lower financial costs. The rest of the eco-&#13;

 in rural and urban areas, where BCRs improve despite the           resources contribute to higher tourist revenues and lower&#13;
 increase in costs. However, some care must be exercised in         business costs. All of these suggest the importance of the&#13;

 Many of the people who do not have access to improved&#13;
 sanitation facilities are poor. Section 6.3 of this study found                    The focus should be on target groups that are most vulner-&#13;

 to income groups 1 and 2, or households earning less than                          means a strong focus on poor regions or locations where a&#13;
 PhP10,000 a month, practice open defecation. The pattern                           larger proportion of the population are children. A strong&#13;

 loans at zero interest. In the case of families belonging to                       efits are projected to be realized is also very important. If&#13;
 income group 1 for example, this could be around 10% of                            the objective is to provide benefits over the short term, the&#13;
 annual household income. While this might not seem large,                          low cost technologies (e.g., pit latrines and community toi-&#13;
 it is important to note that such families already allocate a                      lets) might be sufficient. Apart from favorable BCRs, these&#13;

 the point that poor households will have difficulty financ-                        For example, this study found that investment costs for dry&#13;
 ing sanitation facilities. This argument is further supported                      and wet pit latrines can be recovered within a year. How-&#13;
 by the findings from the FGDs where respondents cited                              ever, these interventions have a short expected life. Decision&#13;
 economic factors for not having a toilet. In this exercise, the                    makers, be it the households, government or donor agen-&#13;
 highest ranked reasons for not having a toilet were â&#128;&#156;cost is                       cies, will therefore have to raise funds constantly in order&#13;
 too highâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;no budget.â&#128;?. Hence, it is essential for gov-                        to replace these facilities. If the objective is to generate ben-&#13;
 ernment and other institutions to take an active role in pro-                      efits over the long term, then interventions that are higher&#13;
 viding access to poor households. Since this is already being                      up the sanitation ladder, including treatment facilities, are&#13;
 done, as exemplified in the study sites, it may therefore be                       more attractive. In saying this however, provisions either&#13;
 interpreted as a call for more active participation.                               in the form of funds or mechanisms must be made for the&#13;

 The costs provided in the previous paragraph focus more&#13;
 on access to on-site sanitation facilities. It goes without say-                   Recommendation 4: In providing access to&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12; Annex 1: Implementation Approaches&#13;
      There are six types of implementation approaches. These are:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) involves facilitating a process to inspire and empower rural&#13;
         communities to stop open defecation and to build and use latrines, without offering external subsidies to&#13;
         purchase hardware such as pans and pipes. It focuses on igniting a change in sanitation behavior rather&#13;
         than constructing toilets. As the name implies, it concentrates on the whole community rather than on&#13;
         individual behaviors â&#128;&#148; collective benefit from stopping open defecation (OD) can encourage a more&#13;
         cooperative approach. It is fundamental that CLTS involve no individual household hardware subsidy&#13;
         and does not prescribe latrine models. It includes encouragement of local innovation for low cost toilet&#13;
         models using locally available materials so that people can select an affordable model that suits them best.&#13;
         (Kar &amp; Pasteur, 2005; Kar &amp; Chambers, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Sanitation marketing: Sanitation marketing uses marketing techniques to achieve social objectives&#13;
         associated with sanitation. It is composed of four components â&#128;&#148; product, price, place and promotion&#13;
         (WSP, 2004). It works on the principle that the latrines should be affordable (price), responsive to the&#13;
         needs of users (product), and installed at the home of the user (place). Promotion, on the other hand,&#13;
         represents the effective use of various means to create awareness and convince consumers to use the&#13;
         product. Social marketing projects generally work by supporting and developing the local private sector&#13;
         and small-scale entrepreneurs to develop such skills and products. Households then buy the toilet of their&#13;
         choice directly from the private sector operator.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Informed choice: This is based on providing consumers a full understanding of the costs and benefits of&#13;
         all available options of a toilet, including the options for individual components. Through the approach,&#13;
         households, communities and municipalities are informed about the benefits and disadvantages of&#13;
         different sanitation technology options before making their own decision as to which option/s to adopt.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Supply-driven: This is a top-down supply-driven approach in which sewers or toilets are provided from a&#13;
         central planning viewpoint with â&#128;&#156;one-size-fits-allâ&#128;? solutions, giving people little choice in the technology&#13;
         they receive. Bureaucrats or technocrats determine the type of technology, costs and expected contribution&#13;
         of the users. The approach generally fails to take into account the expressed needs and conditions of the&#13;
         users of the sanitation facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     â&#128;¢	 Strategic urban sanitation: Based on a concept first proposed by Albert Wright of the World Bank,&#13;
                        strategic urban sanitation was developed into a practical approach by GHK Research and Training in&#13;
                        association with WEDC and Water and Sanitation Program, South Asia, 2000 and further developed and&#13;
                        applied in Latin America and the Caribbean by Rosenweig and Perez (2002). It is based on the following&#13;
                        principles:&#13;
                        â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146; Focus on town-wide solutions that expand coverage to as many residents as possible.&#13;
                        â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146; Ensure that any plan to improve sanitation services is financially sustainable.&#13;
                        â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146; Consult households on sanitation options that are currently in use and according to their expectations.&#13;
                        â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146; Engage in public consultations to discuss the options with stakeholders.&#13;
                        â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146; Include a specific health component.&#13;
                        â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#146; Select an appropriate model for managing the provision of sanitation solutions.&#13;

                     â&#128;¢	 Hygiene behavior change: This involves initiatives to change the sanitation and water-related behavior&#13;
                        of people towards improved hygiene practices. The traditional, and now generally discredited approach,&#13;
                        is the rather didactic â&#128;&#156;hygiene educationâ&#128;? â&#128;&#148; essentially telling people about the diseases associated with&#13;
                        water and excreta, and what they should change in their behavior to avoid these. In recent years the&#13;
                        emphasis has changed to a more participatory approach based on adult learning.&#13;

            Economic assessment of sanitation
            interventions in Philippines
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Philippines is well on its way to
            achieving the sanitation target, which is part of a combined
            drinking water and sanitation target within the Millennium
            Development Goal (MDG). As of 2008, about 76 percent of its
            population had access to improved sanitation facilities (JMP
            2010). This is nearly 18 percentage points higher than the
            estimates for 1990 and 3 percentage points short of the MDG
            target for sanitation. This study aims to generate evidence
            on the costs and benefits of sanitation improvements in
            different contexts in the Philippines. Conducted with a view
            towards identifying the most economically efficient options
            under different conditions, it aims to contribute to the
            decision making processes of government, donor agencies, and
            non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other
            institutions. The study quantified the costs and benefits
            associated with various sanitation options in different
            study sites. The benefits included the impacts on health,
            water sources and treatment, access time, and the reuse of
            human excreta. The costs included capital or investment
            costs and the recurrent costs associated with various
            sanitation options. The costs and benefits of the sanitation
            options were synthesized using standard indicators of
            economic efficiency. These indicators included the
            benefit-cost ratio, cost-effectiveness ratio, net present
            value, internal rate of the return, and payback period of
            sanitation options. Cost-effectiveness ratios cost per
            disability life year averted, cost per disease case averted,
            cost per death averted were also calculated.
