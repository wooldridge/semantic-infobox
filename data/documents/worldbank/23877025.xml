&amp;#12;Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This policy performance review inviting African countries to develop more robust&#13;
policies in the transport sector is timely. It reflects on the achievements of past&#13;
transport policies as a first step toward engaging in a future in which Africa will&#13;
change rapidly and its economy will grow quickly. Transport policies need to&#13;
evolve alongside these changes, ensuring that transport is a strong contributor to&#13;
economic development. In particular, although the focus in the past has been on&#13;
reducing the infrastructure gap, a greater goal of transport policies would be to&#13;
address the accessibility gap where infrastructure and services join forces to help&#13;
economies grow. The impact on transport users stems from how the infrastructure&#13;
is used and not from the infrastructure itself. For this, good policies are essential&#13;
because they lead to both good infrastructure and good use of the infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One important lesson emerging from this review of transport policy performance&#13;
in Africa is that it should be an ongoing exercise, not only for the efficiency of the&#13;
policies but more important for good governance. Road funds illustrate this les-&#13;
son. The Africa Transport Policy Program â&#128;&#147; SSATP â&#128;&#147; was launched in 1987 to&#13;
promote the concept of road commercialization, leading to the creation of second-&#13;
generation road funds and road agencies. Twenty-seven years later, it appears that&#13;
some road institutions are gradually shifting towards operating in a routine mode&#13;
that resembles that of the bureaucracies they were supposed to replace. The initia-&#13;
tive undertaken by road agencies in the member countries of the Association of&#13;
Southern African National Road Agencies â&#128;&#147; ASANRA â&#128;&#147; to self-assess their perfor-&#13;
mance can certainly be commended but its focus on road asset management is&#13;
perhaps too limited; it might have been more beneficial to focus on governance,&#13;
transparency and accountability. Similarly, the landlord port model had positive&#13;
results in terms of the performance of terminals operated by the private sector but&#13;
little progress has been made in sector governance and how ports contribute to the&#13;
economies of their countries beyond the benefits they generate for themselves.&#13;
Railway concessions have also not succeeded in transforming the transport sector.&#13;
Traffic is stagnant or even lower since concessions were signed and there has been&#13;
little recapitalization from private investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   vii&#13;
&amp;#12;Africa Transport Policy Performance Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Building the capacity to formulate policies, oversee their implementation and then&#13;
monitor progress is a critical requirement for taking this additional step in sector&#13;
management for better performance. Little attention was paid to this in the past.&#13;
Road funds and road agencies were created but because of the resultant relocation&#13;
of skills and competence, ministries were left unable to provide the policy leader-&#13;
ship. Similarly, railways were concessioned to the private sector but ministries&#13;
were left with the staff of the former public railway company who were given the&#13;
responsibility of regulating the concessions when their only experience was in op-&#13;
erating a railway in a public environment. It is therefore imperative that ministries&#13;
must endeavor to attract and retain transport professionals with the necessary abil-&#13;
ities and experience in policy development.&#13;
&#13;
Central to good governance is monitoring &amp; evaluation. Leading without data is&#13;
bad politics. Any commitment to change for the better is worthless without a base-&#13;
line, a target and a process for monitoring the actual results. Many policies are&#13;
adopted without measurable targets making it impossible to evaluate their impact.&#13;
This is a major weakness in areas such as road safety and air pollution, which affect&#13;
the health and life of African populations. For the road safety, the baseline is weak&#13;
and for air pollution, it is mostly nonexistent. The situation is similar for other&#13;
indicators in the sector that do not have a baseline and are not monitored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This document is also important for SSATP as it turns a critical page in its history.&#13;
The Program began in 1987 as the Road Maintenance Initiative. Until recently, it&#13;
had focused mainly on road sector management, including rural transport, but it&#13;
has now expanded its domain to other sectors such as ports and railways and im-&#13;
portantly to the pro-poor &amp; pro-growth aspects of transport strategies as well as&#13;
the transport aspects of poverty reduction strategies. With the exception of rural&#13;
transport, the review takes stock of where Africa stands in these areas. This is&#13;
somewhat testimony on the contribution of the Program to policy development in&#13;
the transport sector in Africa. Overall, this contribution has been positive and&#13;
what remains to be done is part of the ongoing process of policy development as&#13;
noted earlier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Personally, I believe that strong policies are at the core of economic development. I&#13;
embraced the principles of the Road Maintenance Initiative when I joined the&#13;
World Bank in 1990, working with many countries to apply these principles and&#13;
continuing with other policies recommended by the SSATP such as in the railway&#13;
sector. The SSATP is now ready to strike out for new horizons in the areas of inte-&#13;

The initiative to review the performance of the transport policies in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa was first mooted by SSATP member countries themselves, and their desire&#13;
for a candid introspection must be acknowledged. This work would not have been&#13;
possible without the study carried out by the consulting firm CPCS (Canadian&#13;
Pacific Consulting Services) and the initial groundwork for a more concise policy&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This working paper summarizes the key findings of the African Transport Policy&#13;
Performance Review 1, carried out by SSATP in selected Anglophone and Franco-&#13;
phone countries in 2013. It highlights the performance of transport policies focus-&#13;
ing on the main transportation modes, excluding maritime and aviation, and is&#13;
augmented by outcomes of related work carried out mainly by SSATP and the&#13;
World Bank. The key objective is to convey the salient messages, and to point out&#13;
the need for more transformational and pragmatic transport policy objectives and&#13;
strategies, in an effort to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the sector.&#13;
The paper addresses some fundamental policy issues, that affect transport perfor-&#13;
mance in Sub-Saharan African countries and is intended for transport sector poli-&#13;
cy level decision-makers.&#13;
&#13;
The review was conducted in six countries: Ethiopia, Benin, Burkina Faso, Gabon,&#13;
Ghana and Zambia, all being considered, for the purpose of the study, as portray-&#13;
ing a fair cross-section of the Sub-Saharan Africa transport sector circumstances&#13;
and challenges. They comprise resource-rich and low-income non-fragile coun-&#13;
tries with a combined GDP of 12% that of Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South&#13;
Africa). Half of them are landlocked and their combined classified road network&#13;
equates to 11% of the total network of SSA. With the exception of Ethiopia, they&#13;
all have implemented rail reforms with varying degrees of success.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the review, the SSATP, the World Bank and other development in-&#13;
stitutions have, within the last decade, carried out useful diagnostic work on&#13;
transport. The policy related aspects of such work, in particular the Africa Infra-&#13;
structure Country Diagnostic 2 have been gleaned to amplify the findings of the&#13;

review. The present paper however does not address other important policy di-&#13;
mensions, such as inter-modal, intra-modal, and sub-modal transport, urban&#13;
transport, and transport logistics, as they were not covered in the main review.&#13;
&#13;
The recorded sustained economic growth in Africa can be attributed to, inter alia,&#13;
some notable transport sector policies that have been implemented in the last two&#13;
decades. Such policies include road sector reforms, rail concessions, port reforms,&#13;
multi-country &amp; regional trade and transport facilitation initiatives. These reforms&#13;
have had positive impact in terms of improved accessibility, improved service de-&#13;
livery, and reduction of public sector fiscal burden. However, coupled to these&#13;
gains, some post-reform shortcomings have been identified, the effect of which, in&#13;
the main, have been to impede transportation efficiency and competitiveness. As a&#13;
result, transportation costs in Africa have not significantly improved.&#13;
&#13;
Road network management and road maintenance funding have moved out of the&#13;
generally bureaucratic public sector to more inclusive and commercially oriented&#13;
regimes, the outcome being a significant improvement in the condition of inter-&#13;
urban road network in many countries. Policy implementation concerns in the&#13;
road sector reform include revenue stagnation 3 and misapplication of the scarce&#13;
resources. While the existence and the role of government entities to manage rail-&#13;
ways, ports, and aviation has been generally acknowledged, the same cannot be&#13;
said about the relatively new post-reform road sub-sector institutions. In some&#13;
countries, their corporate governance structures and operational autonomy have&#13;
been undermined 4.&#13;

  Road Funds were created to generate road user charges that would be re-invested into the&#13;
network upkeep. The main source of the revenue has been fuel levies with tariffs set and&#13;
different levels depending on the principlesâ&#128;&#148;the two extremes being full cost recovery (i.e.&#13;
to include investment, rehabilitation and maintenance cost) or recovery of the marginal&#13;
cost of using the road infrastructure. These tariffs have in general not been reviewed in line&#13;
with changing road network needs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Road safety remains a major challenge and the probability of a road crash fatality&#13;
is highest in Africa. Road fatality per 100,000 population stands at 24.1â&#128;&#148;the high-&#13;
est in the world, and the projections by WHO are that fatalities would increase by&#13;
112% to more than half a million by 2030 5.&#13;
&#13;
Most of the railways in SSA have undergone some form or restructuring that typi-&#13;
cally involved the introduction of private sector management and operations,&#13;
through long-term concessions or management contracts. The reforms, however&#13;
imperfect, have in most cases succeeded in reducing or eliminating the fiscal bur-&#13;
den of inefficient operations on public finances. Moreover, railways in countries&#13;
that have undergone reforms and introduced private sector operation continue to&#13;
operate. In countries that have not undergone similar reforms, railway operations&#13;
have been on a steady decline, or ceased to operate. It has been noted that mainly&#13;
due to overoptimistic pre-concession performance projections, the private sector&#13;
continues to grapple with low profitability, while public officialsâ&#128;&#153; discomfort in the&#13;
lack of recapitalization by the private sector has led, in the extreme of cases, to&#13;
unilateral discontinuation of concessions.&#13;
&#13;
In the ports, the main points of entry of regional corridors, concessioned terminals&#13;
may have in general improved their operations efficiency but overall, market forc-&#13;
es have not succeeded in significantly improving cargo dwell time and costs re-&#13;
main high 6. In addition, regional transit corridor efficiency is still hampered to a&#13;
large extent, by non-infrastructure related barriers and poor logistics.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa countries have embraced the need for developmental partner-&#13;
ships with the private sector through public-private partnerships (PPP). Transport&#13;
modes such as railways and ports have been entry points mainly for service provi-&#13;
sion. The need for substantial capital outlays for transport infrastructure develop-&#13;
ment, coupled with marginal traffic volumes have been notable disincentives for&#13;
the private sector participation particularly in road development. The need for&#13;
more robust policy and institutional framework to safeguard the interests of par-&#13;
ties, and the capacity within the public sector to manage the processes will be criti-&#13;
cal to the success of the process going forward.&#13;

Other policy implementation challenges include emerging realities such as climate&#13;
change, rapid urbanization, and the role of Information and communication&#13;
technology (ICT), in addition to the already existing topical issues such as gender&#13;
equity, HIV/AIDS, employment creation and safety. At the same time, internal&#13;
inadequacies such as poor monitoring &amp; evaluation (M&amp;E), lack of skills, and state&#13;
capture act as subtle policy drags to transport authorities.&#13;
&#13;
In view of the above and against the backdrop that Africaâ&#128;&#153;s transportation prices&#13;
are still the highest in the world 7, there is an urgent need for a deep introspection&#13;
by Africaâ&#128;&#153;s transport policy-makers, first to address the internal administrative&#13;
weaknesses, second to hone the ongoing reforms, and third to introduce more&#13;
transformational policy objectives. This review suggests some specific steps in rela-&#13;
tion to these aspects as well as a performance-monitoring framework.&#13;
&#13;
The common thread running through the messages in the document is that plug-&#13;
ging the transport infrastructure gapsâ&#128;&#148;a primary focus of most transport strate-&#13;
gies, will in itself not significantly improve the continentâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness. Corre-&#13;
sponding continuous efforts are required at country, regional and continental lev-&#13;
els to address the softer policy aspects of transport. Most of the needed policy re-&#13;
forms do not imply significant fiscal burden and yet they are preconditions to fully&#13;
unleashing the benefits of the investments in the sector. Only these efforts will&#13;
address the accessibility gap in a sustainable manner necessary to support the&#13;
growing economies in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Some of the sector-wide policy recommendations that are considered as having&#13;
the potential to make positive impact are the following:&#13;
        (i) To improve overall policy performance, sector ministries and depart-&#13;
            ments should have strong internal capacity for policy development, poli-&#13;
            cy oversight, and performance monitoring &amp; evaluation, as a minimum.&#13;
        (ii) To ensure success in policy performance monitoring, local realities and&#13;
             capacity constraints faced by transport institutions have to be factored in-&#13;
             to the M&amp;E systems. Specifically, transport policy objectives and related&#13;
             indicators should be simplified and limited to a set of commonly used&#13;

&#13;
        and understood key transport indicators that are known to contribute to&#13;
        intended outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
    (iii) To ensure effectiveness, transport sector policies and strategies aligned to&#13;
          the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are required. With-&#13;
          in the global development objective of ending extreme poverty and pro-&#13;
          moting shared prosperity, transport sector is regarded as essential to de-&#13;
          velopment efforts. For this purpose, transport related targets have been&#13;
          proposed. They focus on its contribution in seven areas: agriculture &amp;&#13;
          food security, health, energy, infrastructure, cities &amp; human settlements,&#13;
          consumption &amp; production, and finally climate change.&#13;
&#13;
    (iv) To underpin reforms, strategies are required to safeguard operational au-&#13;
         tonomy and corporate governance in the sector. Such strategies would&#13;
         promote management effectiveness within sector ministries, departments&#13;
         and agencies and ensure better institutionalization of policy reforms.&#13;
&#13;
At sector-specific and modal level, some of the key policy recommendations are:&#13;
&#13;
    (i) To better leverage private sector resources, comprehensive PPP strategy&#13;
        as well as sound institutional capacity (in addition to the national PPP&#13;
        framework) are needed. Such framework should include clarity on the&#13;
        management of risks and contingent liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
    (ii) Transport sector contribution towards cross-border transport efficiency,&#13;
         albeit limited by the multiplicity of stakeholders, should be addressed&#13;
         through a policy decision on specifically dedicated capacity and resources&#13;
         towards the management of corridor transit traffic.&#13;
&#13;
    (iii) Road development accounts for substantial proportion of the sector in-&#13;
          vestments and there is a need to support the investment choices by sound&#13;
          prioritization framework, institutional strengthening and better infor-&#13;
          mation management and performance monitoring. For sustainability and&#13;
          optimization of road transportation benefits, road safety has to be man-&#13;
          aged professionally.&#13;
    (iv) Reforms in railways need to generally advance to the next level, taking in-&#13;
         to account some foundational principles: a) The need to unlock railwaysâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
         latent potential and make them emerge as attractive transportation alter-&#13;
         natives for Africa in some specific markets; b) Railways have to be recog-&#13;
         nized as a business and not a public service; c) An enabling environment&#13;
         is necessary, including support to affordable investment and fair competi-&#13;

         level, beyond the terminal and port levels while at the same time provid-&#13;
         ing competitive and viable services. Regional Economic Communities&#13;
         will also have a critical role to play in providing a regional vision to pro-&#13;
         mote competition among corridors, which will mitigate the risk of rent-&#13;
         seeking situations and high costs in captive markets.&#13;

&amp;#12;I.         Transport Policies to Sustain Development Objectives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
After several years of notable economic growth, policy-makers in Africa face the&#13;
challenge of sustaining this momentum by continuously adapting policies to a&#13;
changing environment. Recent GDP growth in Africa has been over 5% per an-&#13;
num. The continent has shown resilience during the 2009 economic downturn&#13;
with 4.5% GDP growth in 2010 and more than 5% growth in 2011. New partners&#13;
are adding to the optimistic outlook for the continent, in terms of trade and devel-&#13;
opment finance. Universally recognized prospects for Africaâ&#128;&#153;s continued economic&#13;
growth have bolstered the continentâ&#128;&#153;s trade positioning and enhanced strategic&#13;
status among global partners. This, in turn, has fostered the institutional build-up&#13;
for policy harmonization, economic integration and decision-making at the conti-&#13;
nental level 8.&#13;
&#13;
This good economic performance has benefited from policy reforms in the&#13;
transport sector over the last 20 years. Notable among such reforms were the in-&#13;
troduction of dedicated road agencies and road funds managed by road fund&#13;
boards or secretariats, the restructuring of railways and ports, and the introduc-&#13;
tion of private sector management in their operations. Multi-country corridor&#13;
agencies have also emerged to promote multimodal transport and improve per-&#13;
formance along key transit corridors. These reforms have generally resulted in&#13;
improved infrastructure, connectivity and accessibility, which in turn have con-&#13;
tributed towards economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
While transport has made its contribution towards African growth, the overall&#13;
intermediate outcomes at sector level, in comparison to the rest of the world, re-&#13;
main characterized by high costs and sub-optimal services. With international&#13;
transport costs estimated at 12.6% of the delivered value of exports, African coun-&#13;

tries pay more than twice the world average of 6.1% 9. Key factors that contribute&#13;
to higher transport costs include low productivity of the trucking industry mainly&#13;
due to infrastructure constraints, low competition between service providers, and&#13;
weak logistics infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, transport sector development prospects are beset by a number of&#13;
emerging realities such as accelerating urbanization and climate change. Economic&#13;
growth has resulted in a rapid increase in vehicular traffic, which in turn has&#13;
brought about crippling urban congestion. These negative spin-offs are a reflection&#13;
of the inadequacy of policy frameworks, and a weak capacity to manage the envi-&#13;
ronmental, social and safety risks of motorization. Climate change characterized&#13;
by extreme weather events has disrupted transport operations in Africa. At the&#13;
same time, rapid urbanization and growing motorization rates will increase Afri-&#13;
caâ&#128;&#153;s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.&#13;
&#13;
Transport is important as an enabler of development. Within the global develop-&#13;
ment objective of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity, the&#13;
transport sector is regarded as essential to development efforts. The sustainable&#13;
development goals, established under the leadership of the United Nations to&#13;
guide the post-2015 development agenda, recognize this role of the transport sec-&#13;
tor and targets are proposed to monitor its contribution to the achievement of the&#13;
SDGs in seven areas: agriculture &amp; food security, health, energy, infrastructure,&#13;
cities &amp; human settlements, consumption &amp; production, and climate change.&#13;
&#13;
It is within this context that the SSATP has initiated the review of past transport&#13;
policy performance. Its objective is to inform future transport policies, guide insti-&#13;
tutions and programs in their transport policy processes and provide policy-&#13;
makers with a better understanding of the requirements for successful policy de-&#13;
velopment and implementation. There is considerable research and literature on&#13;
the state and performance of the transport sector in Sub-Saharan Africa, but with&#13;
no comprehensive multi-country, multi-modal review of the performance of&#13;
transport policies in Africa. Policy development was assessed by reviewing how&#13;
policies are informed, the process to design policies, and the arrangements put in&#13;
place to monitor and evaluate achievements of objectives. Policy performance was&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
assessed by comparing results to the initial policy objectives in the road, rail and&#13;
port sectors. The review is based on surveys and information collected in six coun-&#13;
tries selected equitably from Francophone and Anglophone Africa (Benin, Burkina&#13;
Faso, Gabon; and Ethiopia, Ghana, Zambia). While the separate report on the&#13;
findings exists, this document is intended as a concise summary of findings and its&#13;
messages are augmented with the results of other relevant transport sector work.&#13;
&#13;
The selected countries, with a combined land area and population of about 11%&#13;
and 18% of the SSA totals respectively, are considered reasonable representation of&#13;
the Sub-Saharan Africa transport sector environment and challenges. For study&#13;
purposes, the countries fall under two typological categories: Gabon, Zambia and&#13;
Ghana are resource-rich while Benin, Burkina Faso, and Ethiopia are considered&#13;
low-income non-fragile countries 10. Three of them (Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and&#13;
Zambia) are landlocked, while the rest depend on others for international freight&#13;
movement. Road transportation is the predominant mode in Africa; these six&#13;
countriesâ&#128;&#153; classified road network equates to 11% (or 14% excluding South Africa)&#13;
of the Sub-Saharan Africa total and about 8% of the vehicle population (or 11%&#13;
excluding South Africa). All the six countries have a rail sub-sector and, except&#13;
Ethiopia, they have had rail reforms with varying degrees of success.&#13;
&#13;
To supplement the findings of the review, it was necessary to consult other rele-&#13;
vant material on some of its aspects. The Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic&#13;
(AICD) 11 in particular deals comprehensively with transport infrastructure diag-&#13;
nostics carried out in 48 SSA countries. Aspects such as reforms in railways, ports&#13;
and roads sub-sectors are well addressed in recent publications. Again, this paper&#13;
does not address other important policy dimensions, such as inter-modal, intra-&#13;
modal, sub-modal transport, urban transport, and transport logistics, as they were&#13;
not covered in the main study. Nonetheless, the modal issues addressed here are&#13;
generally common and fundamental, making them relevant for policy-makers.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy development generally involves research, analysis, consultation and synthe-&#13;
sis of information to produce or define policy objectives. It also includes the estab-&#13;
lishment of strategies to guide implementation. The complete cycle, illustrated in&#13;
Figure 1, requires the support of a robust monitoring &amp; evaluation system to com-&#13;
plete the cycle and feed into the definition of the policy objectives.&#13;

Policy performance along these three steps is assessed following considerations:&#13;
&#13;
Policy objectives: An effective transport policy should be guided by clear objec-&#13;
tivesâ&#128;&#148;to provide direction and help gauge performance.&#13;
&#13;
Strategies: The effective design of strategies and initiatives requires the establish-&#13;
ment of clear linkages with the intended policy objectives, as well as appropriate&#13;
levers that will drive performance during implementation towards these objectives.&#13;
To be effective, strategies must also be designed in line with available capacities to&#13;
implement them.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring &amp; Evaluation: Tracking outcomes against intended objectives is criti-&#13;
cal to understanding the performance of policies and strategies. This also provides&#13;
an important feedback loop that can inform future policies and strategies.&#13;

       Policy objectives implicitly linked to poverty reduction and growth&#13;
&#13;
       Most African countries have clearly established overarching transport policy objec-&#13;
       tives. In most cases, these are documented in a formal guiding national transport&#13;
       policy document. They are regularly updated in some countries, but not in others.&#13;
       Recognizing that sufficient time is needed for policies to have an impact, and ap-&#13;
       preciating the cyclical nature of political changes, it is reasonable to expect that&#13;
       transport policy documents are updated around every 10 years.&#13;
&#13;
       Transport policy objectives are largely consistent with broader national policy ob-&#13;
       jectives. In most countries, overarching transport policy objectives are relatively&#13;
       similar in seeking to provide reliable, efficient, safe and affordable multi-modal&#13;
       transportation infrastructure and services. These objectives are well-recognized by&#13;
       both academics and policy-makers.&#13;
&#13;
                                                However, for the most part, policy objectives&#13;
Box 1 Formal policies exist                     are only implicitly linked to supranational&#13;
All countries included in the Review had estab- commitments such as the Millennium Devel-&#13;
lished formal transport policy documents, with  opment Goals (MDG) or Regional Economic&#13;
the exception of Ethiopia, which was in the     Community (REC) agreements. In fact, most&#13;

tional transport policy or strategy documents   commitments. Some policy documents pre-&#13;
were adopted relatively recently (Benin 2007,   date these commitments, underscoring the&#13;
Burkina Faso 2011, Ghana 2008); in other cas-   need for more frequent updating of national&#13;
es, transport policy documents were adopted&#13;
                                                transport policies. Similarly, there are no ex-&#13;

                                                bedded in transport policy although this does&#13;
                                                not imply that the objectives in themselves&#13;
        are not pro-poor. Pro-poor, pro-growth objectives are generally implicitly rather&#13;
        than explicitly reflected in transport policies and policy objectives. For instance,&#13;
        cross-cutting issues like HIV/AIDS, gender equity or the environment are largely&#13;
        not addressed in transport policies.&#13;
&#13;
       In most countries, transport policy objectives are qualitative and general in nature&#13;
       (sometimes very vague) and not tied to specific targets. There is an implicit as-&#13;
       sumption that more and better transport infrastructure and services will lead to&#13;
       better policy outcomes, but there is no clear articulation of actions and decisions&#13;
       required to achieve these outcomes.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategies: Beset by implementation challenges&#13;
&#13;
Transport sector strategies are generally well aligned with overarching transport&#13;
policy objectives. In some countries, transport sector strategies (as may be articu-&#13;
lated in a medium-term sector development plan) make explicit reference to the&#13;
transport policy objectives that they are seeking to advance.&#13;
&#13;
Poverty reduction and cross-cutting themes like HIV/AIDS and gender equity are&#13;
addressed largely through what appear to be ad hoc programs and initiatives ra-&#13;
ther than formal strategies. As a general observation, there appears to be a more&#13;
systematic effort to address these themes in the road sector. Examples include the&#13;
use of labor-intensive road construction approaches (pro-poor implication), and&#13;
HIV/AIDS awareness for contractors and transport department staff. These pro-&#13;
grams are often funded by development partners but are not mainstreamed for&#13;
inclusion in government-funded initiatives. As such, they are not core aspects of&#13;
government strategies but can be more considered as advocacy and capacity build-&#13;
ing initiatives to support the next cycle of policy development.&#13;
&#13;
Consistent with the priority given to infrastructure development as a policy objec-&#13;
tive, the bulk of strategies focus on infrastructure development plans, usually with&#13;
explicit emphasis on road network expansion. This reflects the challenge of devel-&#13;
oping policies and strategies, which are much more inclusive and comprehensive&#13;
than preparing an infrastructure development plan. As it is often the case, consult-&#13;
ants are entrusted with the development of strategies, which weakens the policy-&#13;
making process and the results due to a lack of ownership.&#13;
&#13;
Beyond the weaknesses in developing transport sector strategies, it is at the imple-&#13;
mentation level that transport sector strategies typically fail or underperform. The&#13;
most significant and common barriers to the successful implementation of&#13;
transport sector strategies include:&#13;
&#13;
Inadequate human resources capacity: In most countries, there are too few quali-&#13;
fied technical resources. This is generally the case across all transport sector de-&#13;
partments but is most acute within road sector departments. One reason for this is&#13;
the relatively low public sector wages compared to the private sector. Another is&#13;
the lack of proper human resource management including the staff recruitment&#13;
and selection process, career development and provision of training for govern-&#13;
ment staff. Also compounding the human resources challenge is the high mobility&#13;
potential for skilled government workers and managers with technical back-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     7&#13;

&#13;
grounds especially following the road sector reforms and the creation of new road&#13;
sector agencies that were better positioned as employers. Even for those who re-&#13;
main within government, mobility from one agency to another reduces corporate&#13;
memory, leading to inconsistency in ownership and in application of policies that&#13;
have a longer-term time horizon (cyclical highway maintenance, for example).&#13;

 remains unclear. In most cases, the challenge&#13;
 stems from institutional capacity limitations     to about US$14 billion or 2.1 percent&#13;
 associated with the collection and manage-        of GDP 15. In almost all cases, external&#13;

Among countries included in the review, the share of external funding support as a&#13;
share of all transport sector spending ranged from 30% to 80%. Notably, the share&#13;
of external funding support among the countries included in the review is signifi-&#13;
cantly greater in Francophone countries than Anglophone ones. External support&#13;
notwithstanding, countries included in the review indicated that funding was in-&#13;
adequate or insufficient to effectively implement transport policy objectives.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Information and information systems: All countries included in the review lack&#13;
the necessary data and information systems to appropriately support their policy&#13;
development processes. In most cases, the basic information available about the&#13;
road network, for example, is not appropriate for policy formulation. This is likely&#13;
the result of limited institutional capacity with respect to data collection, pro-&#13;
cessing and management. It is also symptomatic of weak governance and overall&#13;
lack of accountability when information is unavailable to measure the results of&#13;
policies and government commitments.&#13;
&#13;
Inadequate prioritization framework: Institutional and policy deficiencies contin-&#13;
ue to hamper the effectiveness of investments. Most countries do not have a well-&#13;
established investment prioritization framework. Often, the process for prioritiz-&#13;
ing transport sector investments (in the road sector in particular) appears to be&#13;
somewhat politically or donor-driven, rather than anchored in national objectives&#13;
and priorities. The absence of such instruments creates substantial discretion in&#13;
planning and funding decisions thus influencing the distribution of resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring &amp; evaluation: Weak link in the transport policy process&#13;
&#13;
Transport sector policy performance monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) is gener-&#13;
ally poor or non-existent in SSA. Rarely are M&amp;E results used for a systematic ap-&#13;
proach to reviewing performance. This finding is consistent across all countries&#13;
included in the Review. At best, M&amp;E is done in an ad hoc manner, for example by&#13;
consultants in a specific study, and is often related to external project funding&#13;
conditions. Some countries are at the early stages of developing M&amp;E processes,&#13;
but these are for the most part not yet established or formalized. When M&amp;E ex-&#13;
ists, it is also largely focused on outputs (e.g. kilometers of road constructed) ra-&#13;
ther than on performance and outcomes and even less on impacts.&#13;
&#13;
Countries do not have an established process for monitoring and evaluating&#13;
transport policy performance with respect to poverty-reduction, economic&#13;
growth, and most cross-cutting themes including HIV/AIDS, gender equality and&#13;
environment (tracking road safety statistics is a notable exception although serious&#13;
weaknesses are also found in that area). This is a weakness of the transport sector&#13;
compared to other sectors such as education and health, which are better equipped&#13;
to monitor their impact. There does not appear to be significant interest in the&#13;
transport sector for M&amp;E of these aspects at the country level. It must be recog-&#13;
nized though that monitoring of these transport externalities would be difficult,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      9&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
for a host of reasons, not least of which is the difficulty of establishing causal link-&#13;
ages between transport and these outcomes, and the limited institutional capacity&#13;
to develop and track yet more indicators.&#13;
&#13;
The Rural Access Indicator, measuring the rural population living within 2 kilo-&#13;
mers of an all-season passable road as a portion of total population, provides a&#13;
case in point. This measure is considered a proxy for assessing the poverty impact&#13;
of road investments. It is also one of the transport indicators under the MDGs.&#13;
Yet, Ethiopia is the only country systematically measuring and tracking this indica-&#13;
tor, not only among the countries subject of the present review but also in Africa.&#13;
The point has also been made that the indicator may lead to unaffordable and un-&#13;
sustainable rural road investment strategies. 16&#13;
&#13;
The usefulness of transport and poverty studies in informing transport policies&#13;
and strategies as well as in planning investments has been limited. In some limited&#13;
instances, transport and poverty studies have been undertaken â&#128;&#147; largely by con-&#13;
sultants â&#128;&#147; with the aim of monitoring poverty impacts of road investments and&#13;
development impact of road infrastructure. Results are largely anecdotal insomuch&#13;
as a variety of methodologies are used, interpretation of results to establish the&#13;
causality between the investment and the results is subject to caution, and with so&#13;
many exogenous parameters entering into account, it is difficult to systematize the&#13;
results. The recent review by SSATP 17 of M&amp;E experiences and methodologies in&#13;
rural transport is a step towards harmonization and systemization in this area.&#13;
&#13;
Challenges in making M&amp;E a full component of the policy development process&#13;
are many and include:&#13;
     ï&#129;³    Perennial data limitations including lack of data, poor data quality, and&#13;
          inadequacy of systems to effectively manage data&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#129;³    Human resource and systems capacity constraints to collecting, managing&#13;
          and analyzing data&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;III.       Road Sector Policy Performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy development&#13;
&#13;
From a modal standpoint, transport sector policies mostly focus on roads. This is&#13;
invariably linked to the importance of road transport in the sector, which usually&#13;
represents some 80 to 90 percent of the freight and passenger traffic in countries&#13;
even where other modes are relevant. The road sector also draws the greatest share&#13;
of transport sector funding in SSA countries. Of the countries included in the re-&#13;
view, the road sector funding comprises between 75% to 95% or more of all&#13;
transport sector public expenditures. 19&#13;
&#13;
The review found that most SSA countries have sought to increase the financial&#13;
sustainability of road maintenance funding and the robustness of roads agencies.&#13;
Road management policies in many countries have been informed or influenced&#13;
by the concept of commercialized road management developed by the SSATP and&#13;
the World Bank 20, where road users contribute to road funding through a user fee&#13;
where roads are managed in a business-like manner under an independent Road&#13;
Fund administration and through an autonomous road agency, with a Board of&#13;
Directors representing key stakeholders. Policies based on this concept are articu-&#13;
lated around four blocks:&#13;
&#13;
     Responsibility: Pertains to the need to create a coherent organizational structure&#13;
     responsible for managing different parts of the network. This also requires that&#13;
     all relevant institutions have clearly assigned roles and responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19&#13;
  To some degree, this also likely reflects the fact that in most countries, railway and port&#13;
operations have been reformed to involve greater private sector management. This has re-&#13;
duced financial dependence of these sectors on government funding.&#13;

&amp;#12;Africa Transport Policy Performance Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Ownership: Pertains to the need to represent differing constituencies of road us-&#13;
     ers within road oversight boards, particularly since each constituency has a vest-&#13;
     ed interest in the sound management of the road network.&#13;
&#13;
     Sound business practices: Pertains to the establishment of commercially orient-&#13;
     ed management practices in order to derive Value for Money (VfM) from road&#13;
     spending.&#13;
&#13;
     Stable and secure financing: Pertains to the need to establish an adequate and&#13;
     stable flow of funds through the creation of an independent road fund.&#13;
&#13;
This finding was confirmed in a second review carried out by SSATP specific to the&#13;
road sector in Southern Africa. 21&#13;
&#13;
The adoption by most countries of a Road Sector Development Plan (RSDP) or its&#13;
equivalent is in itself a policy statement in terms of defining the approach to&#13;
adopt. Such a plan articulates the road sector objectives and funding requirements,&#13;
among other aspects. They emphasize in particular coordination among develop-&#13;
ment partners, when funding and supporting its implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Still, a Road Sector Development Plan has limited policy objectives, and road sec-&#13;
tor policies in Sub-Saharan Africa are primarily focused on the expansion and&#13;
maintenance of national networks. Within such a policy framework, objectives&#13;
and related targets are mostly focused on the physical construction and upgrading&#13;
of roads. This orientation, however, is not that irrational given that Africa has the&#13;
lowest endowment of all-weather roads of any region and ranks the lowest in rela-&#13;
tion to connectivity and quality of roads. Just as the United States focused on road&#13;
expansion in the early part of the 20th century to get the farmer â&#128;&#152;out of the mud,â&#128;&#153;&#13;
and China and India a century later focused on connecting most of their towns&#13;
and villages with all-weather paved roads, Sub-Saharan Africa needed to embark&#13;
on a similar expansion of its networks to meet the connectivity and mobility needs&#13;
of its growing population and economic production in the 21st century 22.&#13;

&#13;
Explicit pro-poor strategies, where these are in place, are rather focused on em-&#13;
ployment of low-skilled labor for road construction projects 23.&#13;
&#13;
With the exception of safety, other cross cutting themes, including HIV/AIDS,&#13;
gender equity, and the environment are generally not addressed in road sector&#13;
policy objectives. Where these are addressed, it is typically through what appear to&#13;
be ad hoc programs and initiatives, rather than overarching strategies. Most do-&#13;
nor-supported project lending for roads, however, does address the above-&#13;
mentioned cross-cutting themes, which become part of the active donor dialog&#13;
with the beneficiary countries. Such programs include HIV/AIDS awareness edu-&#13;
cation for road agency staff, contractors, and road transporters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy outcomes&#13;
&#13;
This section provides a quick overview of typical policy outcomes in the road sec-&#13;
tor in SSA. The performance of road sector policy in most SSA countries is largely&#13;
measured in terms of a) the length of new roads constructed and b) the condition&#13;
of existing roads, this reflecting the priority given to infrastructure in sector policy&#13;
development. In most countries, physical condition of the inter-urban road net-&#13;
work can be characterized as fair to good, and the overall condition of main roads,&#13;
except in conflict-affected countries, has improved over the last two decades,&#13;

&amp;#12;Africa Transport Policy Performance Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
compared to the dismal status reported in the World Bank policy study on road&#13;
deterioration in developing countries in 1988 24. With respect to cross-cutting&#13;
themes, safety is generally the only area of performance tracked in SSA countries.&#13;
&#13;
In urban areas, road congestion, pavement conditions and level of services have&#13;
deteriorated mainly due to rapid urbanization. Road user perceptions, especially&#13;
those of urban users, often focused on service standards could include expecta-&#13;
tions that are not economically affordable or justified. Their concerns mostly re-&#13;
flect poor management and utilization of infrastructure (e.g. congestion and safe-&#13;
ty) rather than physical condition per se. Nonetheless, these are important inputs&#13;
and reflect policy failure in relation to stakeholder participation in policy formula-&#13;
tion, design and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Safety performance can be characterized as generally poor in most SSA countries.&#13;
Africa, the home of only 12% of the world population accounts for only 2% of the&#13;
worldâ&#128;&#153;s vehicle population, yet the road crash fatality rate, estimated at 24.1 per&#13;
100,000 of population, is the highest. In absolute terms, fatalities nearly doubled&#13;
between 1990 and 2010, rising from 125,198 to 230,140. The projections by WHO&#13;
estimate that in SSA, fatalities would increase by 112%, from 243,000 in 2015 to&#13;
514,000 in 2030.&#13;
&#13;
There is little evidence, beyond anecdotes that vehicle operating costs and freight&#13;
rates have declined. In these two areas, with respect to truck transportation, users&#13;
often rated road sector performance as poor. This perception is strongly influ-&#13;
enced by trucking regulations and controls (especially frequent police checks, time&#13;
delays and illegal payments) more than by road conditions. With respect to pas-&#13;
senger transportation, travel times have often been reduced on main interurban&#13;
roads, thanks to road condition improvements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy considerations&#13;
&#13;
The review pointed to weaknesses in implementation of road sector reforms, and&#13;
identified inadequate funding of maintenance as a common policy implementa-&#13;
tion challenge. Many SSA countries have adopted a second-generation road fund&#13;
to ensure stable funding for road maintenance, but few have fully implemented&#13;
one. The Francophone countries have lagged behind their Anglophone counter-&#13;
parts, particularly in terms of the way the road fund revenues are generated.&#13;
Whereas the Anglophone countries are primarily reliant on road user charges, the&#13;
Francophone countries appear to generate a significant proportion of their reve-&#13;
nues from sources such as earmarked public funding, government grants, supple-&#13;
mentary taxes on income (in Gabon, for instance), and donor funding. To some&#13;
extent, this absence of financial autonomy is due to a lack of representation of&#13;
road users in decisions pertaining to financing and managing the road network.&#13;
Being less involved in decision-making, the broader constituency of road users in&#13;
Francophone countries appears to have been less inclined to support reforms&#13;
aimed at enhancing revenue mobilization capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
With respect to the adequacy of funding, countries reported that road sector reve-&#13;
nues were inadequate to address network needs. This is particularly the case for&#13;
road maintenance. In some countries, for example, actual maintenance needs are&#13;
three times greater than budgeted. In others, the maintenance budget was diverted&#13;
to road upgrading projects, to respond to political considerations. In a few, there&#13;
appears to be discrepancies between official budget allocations and the actual&#13;
availability or release of funds.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the ongoing road development works, largely financed by donor assis-&#13;
tance (including borrowing from new development partners), continue to expand&#13;
the magnitude of the stock of roads with associated expanding maintenance needs.&#13;
The inability of road funds to meet their respective mandates suggests that in their&#13;
present form, the institutional and financial arrangements for road infrastructure&#13;
management may not be sustainable on account of the following factors:&#13;
    ï&#129;³ Failure or inability to generate revenues to meet mandated requirementsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
      a revenue challenge.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#129;³ Misallocation of revenues amongst mandated prioritiesâ&#128;&#148;a governance&#13;
      challenge.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other important aspects of policy implementation pertain to prioritization of sec-&#13;
tor investments and related capacity constraints. Most road sector development&#13;
programs do not explain how road sector investments are prioritized (e.g. high-&#13;
ways versus rural roads) and the extent to which priorities are anchored to specific&#13;
development goals (e.g. poverty alleviation). Moreover, the extent to which actual&#13;
spending on these programs is aligned to the budget allocations is generally poor 25&#13;
(actual spending is significantly below budget). The reason for this gap varies, but&#13;
can include delays in procuring large works projects, delays in budget approvals&#13;
and releases, or scope of programs being set higher than the budget ceilings.&#13;
&#13;
The inadequate capacity of the local contractor base was also cited as a challenge,&#13;
particularly for undertaking medium- to large-scale projects. This was the case in&#13;
several countries such as Benin and Zambia. Country representatives in Ethiopia&#13;
noted in particular the shortage of qualified civil engineers. To address this, the&#13;
Ethiopia Roads Authority, for example, has begun financing the training of 3,000&#13;
civil engineers in the nationâ&#128;&#153;s universities and training centers.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy development&#13;
&#13;
Most of the railways in Sub-Saharan Africa have undergone some form or restruc-&#13;
turing over the last twenty years. This typically involved the introduction of pri-&#13;
vate sector management and operations, through long-term concessions or man-&#13;
agement contracts.&#13;
&#13;
The objectives of most rail sector reforms generally included:&#13;

In most cases, the reforms were not explicitly designed to be pro-poor or pro-&#13;
growth nor did they explicitly address cross-cutting themes including HIV/AIDS,&#13;
gender equity, environmental performance, and safety. In fact, most rail sector&#13;
reforms were driven by structural adjustment policies of the mid-1990s seeking to&#13;
reduce the fiscal burden, rather than specific transport objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy outcomes&#13;
&#13;
In most cases, rail reforms succeeded in reducing or eliminating the fiscal burden&#13;
of inefficient operations on public finances. In some cases, States continue to con-&#13;
tribute to infrastructure and passenger services, though this is arguably less than it&#13;
was under the previous government-operating model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   19&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Beyond this fiscal outcome â&#128;&#147; which was often the main objective of reforms, other&#13;
outcomes are questionable 26. Certainly, there is not much evidence that rail sector&#13;
reforms have succeeded in diverting freight traffic from road to rail. In many cases,&#13;
total freight tonnage has declined (although in some of these same cases, ton-km&#13;
have increased, owing to the more profitable nature of long haul traffic for private&#13;
operators). Passenger traffic has in most cases declined or been terminated alto-&#13;
getherâ&#128;&#148;as private operators focus on more profitable freight business.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
There is also little evidence that reforms have led to significant new investment in&#13;
railway assets, operations and services levels continue to be poor as reported by&#13;
freight shippers. This has resulted in increased pressure on road networks.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   Similarly, there is no clear indication&#13;

&#13;
Ultimately, the review found that railway reforms, however imperfect, have been&#13;
less expensive to the public authorities than continued operation by them. Moreo-&#13;
ver, railways in countries that have undergone reforms and introduced private&#13;
sector operation continue to operate. In countries that did not, operations have&#13;
continued to steadily decline, or cease to operate (e.g. Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Ethi-&#13;
opia, Ghana, Sudan), at significant continued cost to government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy considerations&#13;
&#13;
Notable considerations with respect to the underachievement of rail sector re-&#13;
forms include the following:&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#129;³ In some instances, the actual commitment of governments to the reforms&#13;
         was weak or railway concessions as public-private partnerships were mis-&#13;
         understood by governments. Private sector management of formerly gov-&#13;
         ernment-controlled railway operations led to conflict, where authorities&#13;
         sought to reinterpret or even change terms of the concession.&#13;

&amp;#12;Africa Transport Policy Performance Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#129;³ This was the case for passenger rail public service obligations, which have&#13;
       generally been problematic. Such services seldom have the potential to be&#13;
       cost-recovering and are viewed by private operators as a â&#128;&#156;burdenâ&#128;&#157;, while&#13;
       governments view such a service as a social (and political) necessity.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#129;³ Another source of conflict was staff employment and redundancies where&#13;
       again the business approach of operators was in opposition to the so-&#13;
       cial/political approach of governments.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#129;³ Concessions failed to bring additional resources for rehabilitation of railway&#13;
       tracks and renewal of rolling stock. Without an apparent improvement in&#13;
       the quality of services, railways were unable to attract a larger share of the&#13;
       transport market.&#13;
     ï&#129;³ There has been limited monitoring of performance with respect to other&#13;
       objectives. This is rendered more difficult due to the limited disclosure of&#13;
       operating and financial information by concessionaires, frequently due to&#13;
       differing views of obligations under the concession agreement.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#129;³ At the same time, governments did not build their capacity for proper over-&#13;
       sight of concessions. With government staff in charge of overseeing the&#13;
       railway concessions coming often from the former government-managed&#13;
       railway company, the conditions were not in place for a constructive part-&#13;
       nership but rather for dialogue fraught with conflicts.&#13;

&amp;#12;V.        Port &amp; Maritime Sector Policy Performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy development&#13;
&#13;
As in the rail sector, many countries in SSA have reformed their port sectors and&#13;
introduced private sector management and operations. In most cases, port reforms&#13;
followed the landlord port model and involved the partitioning of the port sector&#13;
into (a) a government-owned port authority; and (b) a private sector operator&#13;
(generally recruited through a concessioning process).&#13;
&#13;
The objectives of these reforms have varied but have generally included:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#129;³ reducing the financial burden of port operations on the national treasury&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#129;³ increasing the productivity and efficiency of port operations&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#129;³ improving port services, including reducing dwell times and reducing the&#13;
       cost of port operations and transit logistics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    As with rail sector reforms, port sector&#13;

&amp;#12;Africa Transport Policy Performance Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy outcomes&#13;
&#13;
Generally, port sector reforms in SSA have succeeded in reducing or eliminating&#13;
the fiscal burden of inefficient operations on public finances. Government support&#13;
for port operations has significantly reduced and in most cases, ended altogether&#13;
as a result of the reforms and concessioning.&#13;
&#13;
In some cases, private operators have also made significant investment in infra-&#13;
structure, which would otherwise have been paid for by public funds, or not un-&#13;
dertaken at all. It was likewise found that government infrastructure investment&#13;
obligations were largely in line with concessionaire expectations. This is a differ-&#13;
ence with railways showing the higher profitability and lower level of risk in the&#13;
port sector compared to the railway sector.&#13;
&#13;
Though detailed information on the financial performance of most port conces-&#13;
sions are not publicly available, consultations suggest that most port terminal con-&#13;
cessionaires have been operating profitably and, in many cases, paying a conces-&#13;
sion fee to the government.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of port user outcomes, performance improvements in ports/terminals&#13;
can generally be characterized as fair. In many cases, ship wait and turnaround&#13;
times have improved only marginally. Elsewhere they have not improved or have&#13;
increased since the reforms. Container handling charges remain high, as do con-&#13;
tainer dwell times at the port. The private sector, including terminal operators and&#13;
shippers, does not seem to have the interest in reducing dwell time, mainly due to&#13;
low logistics skills, and cash constraints 28. The market incentives, in most cases, are&#13;
not strong enough to drive the needed changes.&#13;
&#13;
There have been notable positive changes, however, including increases in termi-&#13;
nal productivity, improvements to container tracking, storage management, and&#13;
to service levels. It can be argued that these improvements were under the control&#13;
of private operators while public authorities have not been able to implement port&#13;
development strategies capable of absorbing the increase of traffic resulting from&#13;
economic growth.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Certainly, there is no clear indication that port reforms have contributed to pov-&#13;
erty alleviation, broader economic growth or improvements with respect to&#13;
MDGs. As is the case with rail sector reforms, these ends were never the explicit&#13;
objectives of the reforms, nor can a causal link between port reform, performance,&#13;
and such downstream impacts be easily established.&#13;
&#13;
Overall, port sector reforms appear to have worked modestly well and arguably&#13;
better than rail sector reforms. Port reforms have reduced the fiscal burden associ-&#13;
ated with government port operations, attracted new investment in port opera-&#13;
tions, and in some cases contributed to port productivity and service level im-&#13;
provements, though these have been more modest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy considerations&#13;
&#13;
Notable considerations with respect to the performance of port sector reforms&#13;
include the following:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#129;³    Where operations have been concessioned or otherwise contracted out to&#13;
         the private sector, the operator is in many cases a virtual monopoly. One&#13;
         reason is that most coastal SSA countries have one major port for inter-&#13;
         national traffic. While competition exists among ports for traffic with&#13;
         landlocked countries, domestic traffic, which often represents more than&#13;
         90 percent of the total traffic of the port, is with only a few exceptions&#13;
         constrained to use its national port. The second reason is that the size of&#13;
         the market is too small to have several concessionaires. While concession-&#13;
         aires were selected based on competition for the market, with long-term&#13;
         concessions of 30 years, competition does not become the driver of de-&#13;
         velopment and performance.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#129;³    Of equal concern is that many port concessions/operations involve the&#13;
         same investors across countries. This limits competition among ports in&#13;
         the same geographic areas and can have negative implications on service&#13;
         levels and rates. To some extent, vertical integration of port operators&#13;
         with maritime transport can also have a significant influence on port de-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     25&#13;

&#13;
          velopment and performance through the decisions on the creation of re-&#13;
          gional hubs 29.&#13;
     ï&#129;³    A positive development is the single window concept (currently being&#13;
          implemented in Benin) where all information between freight forwarders,&#13;
          shipping lines and the port operators is managed through a single sys-&#13;
          tem/process. This type of system could potentially be a very meaningful&#13;
          source of information for tracking and monitoring port sector perfor-&#13;
          mance if it can be shared and used by policy makers. Its introduction in&#13;
          Singapore more than 20 years ago spurred the development of the port as&#13;
          a major regional hub, particularly for container traffic.&#13;

cost benefit for the region. In addition, all the cost benefit would befall the hub itself, while&#13;
costs for all other ports in the area would be higher. Transit time of import and export to&#13;
and from the region would also increase for most ports. The paper was complemented in&#13;

&amp;#12;VI.        Corridor / Transit Traffic Policy Performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy development&#13;
&#13;
Bi-national initiatives and Regional Economic Communities (REC) have led ef-&#13;
forts to improve the flow of goods and people across borders in Africa. A growing&#13;
number of corridor organizations have emerged as the proper institutional mech-&#13;
anism to facilitate transit traffic, particularly to and from land-locked countries.&#13;
While early results have been encouraging, consultations undertaken as part of this&#13;
review with shippers, carriers and other stakeholders involved in transit traffic,&#13;
suggest that corridor management and transit traffic performance have improved&#13;
only marginally, if at all.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      Within the overarching objective of&#13;

                                                      with specific performance targets.&#13;
&#13;
Most corridor and transit traffic improvement strategies focus on â&#128;&#156;softâ&#128;&#157; issues.&#13;
Specific strategies include harmonization of regulations along corridors, reducing&#13;
dwell times at ports and delays associated with control points (formal and infor-&#13;
mal), harmonizing and coordinating customs processes and other administrative&#13;
requirements at border crossings. In some instances, strategies also address physi-&#13;
cal infrastructure improvements. Examples include the West African Transport &amp;&#13;
Transit Facilitation Project (WATTFP), which is seeking to improve road condi-&#13;
tions or to provide new border infrastructure by building new border facilities.&#13;

Policy outcomes&#13;
&#13;
While transit traffic and trade have generally increased in SSA over the last 10-20&#13;
years, the extent to which corridor management initiatives have been effective to&#13;
improve corridor performance is not clear. Performance outcomes of corridor and&#13;
transit traffic initiatives are in most cases not well documented. Reliable infor-&#13;
mation on total transportation time, logistics costs and reliability from port of&#13;
entry to destination and vice versa along selected corridors is not readily available.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
From an institutional perspective, dedicated corridor organizations appear to have&#13;
been more effective than REC-driven corridor initiatives. This may be due to the&#13;
better institutional capacity and focus of corridor organizations on transit traffic&#13;
issues in fully operational and specific corridors, as compared to a range of a ge-&#13;
neric existing and potential corridors usually traversing several countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy considerations&#13;
&#13;
The review has identified a number of challenges to the implementation of corri-&#13;
dor strategies:&#13;
&#13;
Jurisdictional coordination: Despite their regional character, transit and facilita-&#13;
tion systems have continued to operate as fragmented national systems rather than&#13;
integrated regional systems. It is not unusual for countries to agree on viable poli-&#13;
cies and practices at the regional level, only to have them reversed at the national&#13;
level in the name of national interest and sovereignty.&#13;
&#13;
Limited authority: Corridor agencies or the Regional Economic Communities do&#13;
not have the authority to implement strategies and actions in member countries.&#13;
In most cases, REC policies have to be transformed into and adopted as national&#13;
policies to be implemented and to receive necessary funding. Countries have then&#13;
the authority in terms of implementation. This is the case for policies as well as&#13;
infrastructure projects for which REC or corridor authorities are not implement-&#13;
ing agencies and funding being provided and managed at country level.&#13;
&#13;
Lack of dedicated country staff: Although countries have the responsibility for&#13;
implementation, often there is no full-time office or personnel dedicated to corri-&#13;
dor initiatives within country transportation departments. For example, each par-&#13;
ticipating country in the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Organization (ALCO) has set up&#13;
a National Facilitation Committee (NFC) to coordinate the implementation of the&#13;
work of ALCO in the country. The NFC is made up of representatives of partici-&#13;
pating agencies. However, they have not yet a full-time personnel working at&#13;
country level.&#13;
&#13;
Lack of effective M&amp;E: Few corridor initiatives have clearly established perfor-&#13;
mance targets against which to monitor performance. ALCO is a notable excep-&#13;
tion, in that expected targets (e.g. port dwell times) are established and perfor-&#13;
mance is measured against these targets. Beyond defining targets, most corridor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         29&#13;
&amp;#12;Africa Transport Policy Performance Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
initiatives do not effectively collect data or indicators on corridor performance, for&#13;
example related to total transit times, logistics costs and reliability. The Northern&#13;
Corridor Transport and Transit Coordination Authority is an exception with a&#13;
strong monitoring system in place. Performance indicators are inherently difficult&#13;
to track (even in developed countries), but there are no doubt opportunities for&#13;
better monitoring and reporting in these areas (resource limitations notwithstand-&#13;
ing). The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) provides some quanti-&#13;
tative measures of logistics performance, many of which relate, directly or indi-&#13;
rectly, to corridor performance. Specific examples of relevant LPI data include&#13;
metrics relating to customs clearance processes, the ease of arranging competitive-&#13;
ly priced shipments, and the ability to track consignments.&#13;

borders the agreed corridor or regional initiatives/strategies. These initiatives in&#13;
effect compete with other priorities for scarce resources at the national level.&#13;
&#13;
Lack of implementation guidelines: More than enough analysis has been done&#13;
over the years on the challenges facing regional transport but few solutions have&#13;
been agreed to address these problems. Despite these studies and the multiplicity&#13;
of gatherings in terms of meetings, workshops and symposia, implementation re-&#13;
mains weak owing largely to lack of effective implementation guidelines. Often,&#13;
recommendations are not matched by corresponding detailed and coordinated&#13;
implementation guidelines. It is left to each government to decide how best to&#13;
proceed, which has often resulted in limited or ineffective action.&#13;

&amp;#12;VII.     Lessons and Way Forward&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Opportunity to establish a public-private sector partnership&#13;
&#13;
African countries are part of the ongoing wave of leveraging private sector re-&#13;
sources through PPP arrangements. As mentioned above, this has been the case in&#13;
the port and railway sectors but the potential of public-private sector partnerships&#13;
in the road sector remains largely unexploited in Africa. In the transport sector,&#13;
ports, railways and civil aviation have been the point of entry especially in service&#13;
provision. In the road sector, transport services are typically provided by the pri-&#13;
vate sector and opportunities for a PPP lie mainly in the provision and operation&#13;
of road infrastructure. Still, traffic volumes, especially in rural Africa, are low and&#13;
many roads do not have the requisite break-even thresholds with the exception of&#13;
urban roads, bridges and sections of major road corridors. Provision of mass&#13;
transport services in urban areas is also an area that is receiving increased attention&#13;
from public authorities and presents a good potential for private sector involve-&#13;
ment, including financing. Additional options exist in addition such as annuity&#13;
payment, design-build contracts and performance-based contracts, with only the&#13;
latter becoming mainstreamed in the set of tools available to road asset managers.&#13;
In all cases, the actual capacity of the private sector to contribute financially to&#13;
investments needs to be carefully assessed as the recent experience in railways has&#13;
shown that concessions perform better, where the public sector is prepared to pre-&#13;
invest in the fixed assets.&#13;
&#13;
The impressive growth rates coupled with the huge infrastructure gap and the will-&#13;
ingness of the consumer to pay for improved services are regarded as some of the&#13;
drivers of future public-private sector partnerships in Africa. Still more needs to be&#13;
done on both the supply and the demand sides to improve attractiveness for a&#13;
PPP. On the supply side, the obstacles to mobilization of private sector resources&#13;
need addressing. On the demand side, public authorities need to take note of the&#13;
need for clarity on the scope, expectations and requirements in packaging a PPP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    31&#13;
&amp;#12;Africa Transport Policy Performance Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A review of three case studies 32 has shown that a framework covering the following&#13;
issues that safeguards the processes and the interests of the parties to the partner-&#13;
ship is critical to the its success: risks associated with private financing and alloca-&#13;
tion between the private and the public sectors, enabling legal frameworks, con-&#13;
tractual issues, institutional and governance issues, capacity development, funding,&#13;
lenders requirements and the need for political will and support. In particular, the&#13;
four main lessons came out of the review:&#13;
&#13;
PPP policy and institutional frameworks: Political commitment and leadership is&#13;
required at the highest level of government to promote public-private sector part-&#13;
nerships in roads development. At the same time, a central PPP Unit, with strong&#13;
backing by highest level political authority, will provide the concentration of ex-&#13;
pertise needed to harness resources from government and external parties, and&#13;
enable efficient PPP procurement.&#13;
&#13;
Legislative framework: A legal framework is required to enable an effective, trans-&#13;
parent and efficient PPP processâ&#128;&#148;a prerequisite for satisfactory results during&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Private finance and risk factors: Political and currency risks need to be carefully&#13;
considered in Africa where they are perceived to be particularly high. Lender con-&#13;
cerns and requirements also include unfamiliar jurisdictions, fairness and trans-&#13;
parency, sponsor quality (understood as the private sector consortium bidding for&#13;
the concession), contract terms including termination and contract enforceability.&#13;
&#13;
Tolling: Political resolve is required to support the introduction of tolling and the&#13;
periodic increases in tolls built into the concession agreement. Without this, the&#13;
imposition of tolls is likely to provoke opposition from residents and road users.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, there is a need for policy framework to address contingent liabilities.&#13;
These liabilities need to be examined from a macro-economic perspective to de-&#13;
termine their affordability. Such liabilities include premature discontinuation of&#13;
partnerships, and uncertainties related to debt and revenue guarantees. Countries&#13;
have to decide whether to assume these liabilities and if so, determine how to val-&#13;
ue, monitor and limit them. Some of the approaches to manage contingent liabili-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
ties include: policy objectives that require contracting terms to limit them, re-&#13;
quirement that such liabilities be quantified and regularly reviewed and published,&#13;
and restricting risk-bearing to areas that the public sector has control over.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Informed policy development&#13;
&#13;
Effective transport policy performance hinges on an efficient and well-articulated&#13;
policy process. For that, the transport policy process needs to address a number of&#13;
pervasive challenges that hinder effective policy design and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
The first challenge is the lack of adequate institutional capacity to effectively im-&#13;
plement transport sector strategies. This can be as much about actual capacity con-&#13;
straints â&#128;&#147; inadequate human and financial resources, poor information and in-&#13;
formation systems, and a lack of prioritization frameworks, as it can be a failure in&#13;
the design of the strategies themselves â&#128;&#147; if these do not appropriately recognize&#13;
local realities and related implementation capacity issues. Indeed transport policies&#13;
will not perform if there is no capacity to implement them. This appears to have&#13;
been a constraint for many policies and strategies in SSA and warrants greater fo-&#13;
cus if future policies are to succeed.&#13;
&#13;
The second challenge is weak monitoring and evaluation of transport policy per-&#13;
formance. Without appropriate data and indicators to understand past perfor-&#13;
mance with respect to policy objectives, it is very difficult to develop meaningful&#13;
transport policies and strategies going forward. In some respects, the lack of an&#13;
effective M&amp;E process undermines the entire transport policy cycle.&#13;
&#13;
Central to the success of future solutions is the recognition of local realities and&#13;
capacity constraints faced by transport policy makers. In this light, simplification&#13;
is a key to improving the effectiveness of transport policies. Less may be more.&#13;
&#13;
Specifically, transport policy objectives and related indicators should be simplified&#13;
and limited to a set of universally used and understood key transport indicators&#13;
that are known to contribute to intended outcomes. In the absence of reliable data&#13;
continuously collected to measure outputs and evaluate outcomes, developing and&#13;
tracking transport-related poverty indicators or other second-order impacts is not&#13;
likely to produce useful results. Such indicators are simply too abstract or difficult&#13;
to measure meaningfully. The limited applicability and use of the Rural Accessibil-&#13;
ity Index is a case in point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         33&#13;
&amp;#12;Africa Transport Policy Performance Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Improvement of transport policy M&amp;E should also be recognized as a key priority&#13;
of transport departments. Where possible, a limited set of quantifiable indicators&#13;
based on objective data should be developed. Until these indicators become avail-&#13;
able, policy makers should complement available data with informed judgement&#13;
based on local realities. This approach is imperfect, but better than not assessing&#13;
performance at all. In any case, M&amp;E activities should be kept simple and proven&#13;
cost-effective, before introducing new indicators.&#13;

&#13;
To improve transport policy monitoring and evaluation in SSA, a three-pronged&#13;
approach is recommended comprising simplified indicators, improved infor-&#13;
mation management and capacity development support, as summarized in Fig-&#13;
ure 3. The first consideration is that of simplified indicators. In view of the capaci-&#13;
ty constraints, it is important to limit performance indicators to what can realisti-&#13;
cally be measured, supplemented with informed judgment. The second aspect is&#13;
that of developing and sustaining the capacity for the M&amp;E function. This would&#13;
entail the creation of dedicated M&amp;E units where they do not exist and enhance-&#13;
ment of the existing human resources. Finally, realistic information and data man-&#13;
agement systems need to be established and supported by appropriate infrastruc-&#13;
ture, to inform indicators and judgments appropriately. Moving forward with this&#13;
approach will require seed funding, but should in the long term provide significant&#13;
value for money.&#13;

In this regard, SSATP has developed a first sub-set of indicators on transport sec-&#13;
tor governance for monitoring and identifying areas where policy action is needed.&#13;
The ten indicators comprehensively cover the fundamental phases (strategy, re-&#13;
source allocation, implementation, and accountability processes) of a governance&#13;
cycle framework 33 (Figure 4). The use of these indicators by countries would ena-&#13;
ble them to assess their sector performance and enable peer comparison of per-&#13;
formance between countries.&#13;

              mation management and performance M&amp;E. While the need to give priority to&#13;
              maintenance has already been emphasized since the Road Maintenance Initiative 34&#13;
              started in the late 80s, in a changing period for Africa, sustainable development of&#13;
              its road network in support of continuous economic growth requires careful con-&#13;
              sideration of the funding proportions between investment and maintenance en-&#13;
              suring that resources for the latter are made available and increasing in proportion&#13;
              of the efforts made for the former.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              34&#13;
                Various SSATP documents available at www.ssatp.org can be consulted on the concept of&#13;
              commercialized road management, including the creation of road maintenance funds and&#13;
              road agencies, promoted by the Road Maintenance Initiative.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Road sector reforms, including the introduction of road agencies and road funds,&#13;
seem to have been more effective than under the previous status quoâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
management by line departments of ministries. The overall improvement of the&#13;
road network shows that maintenance efforts have accompanied the investments,&#13;
which was not the case thirty years ago. However, funding remains a continuous&#13;
challenge for road maintenance. Current fuel levies are insufficient on their own to&#13;
cover needs. This may require countries to look at new sources of road funding,&#13;
and in particular private financing which has been so far largely unused in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
A policy review of the reform is especially needed to improve road user revenue&#13;
and its utilization. While some countries have still to implement the concept of&#13;
road commercialization, the performance of those which already implemented the&#13;
concept seems to have stalled. Road funds had a positive impact in terms of giving&#13;
greater priority to road maintenance and using resources more efficiently, this&#13;
being somewhat equivalent to receiving more resources. This is no longer ade-&#13;
quate, in a changing world where more is needed and where the infrastructure gap&#13;
in Africa remains huge and, if unaddressed, will become an obstacle to continuous&#13;
economic growth; where methods of government are changing and more trans-&#13;
parency and accountability is required from governments; where the road sector&#13;
cannot stay in its technical ivory tower and has to demonstrate that as other sec-&#13;
tors it contributes to ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.&#13;
&#13;
Authorities in charge of roads, road funds and road agencies face the challenge of&#13;
putting in place new management methods which use modern technologies, new&#13;
operational methods such as performance-based contracts and public-private sec-&#13;
tor partnerships, more affordable strategies using local resources to reach a greater&#13;
share of the populations along with safer strategies to protect the most vulnerable.&#13;
This will require proper M&amp;E systems to provide the indicators to underpin and&#13;
evaluate policy decisions and performance in a transparent manner.&#13;
&#13;
Critical to the sustainability of the road sector, road safety needs to be managed&#13;
professionally. The safe systems approach is now recognized as the basis upon&#13;
which good road safety management practice rests. Within a safe systems ap-&#13;
proach, effective management practice addresses road safety as a production pro-&#13;
cess with three interrelated elements: institutional management functions to pro-&#13;
duce interventions that in turn produce results. The framework within which&#13;
countries can most effectively tackle their road safety challenges, therefore require&#13;
the existence of a well mandated road safety lead institution as a prerequisite for&#13;
successful interventions and results.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Rail sector&#13;
Similarly to the road sector reforms, reforms in the railway sector are an unfin-&#13;
ished business. Past reforms have stopped the drain on the economies caused by&#13;
inefficient and bankrupt railway companies and â&#128;&#156;stopped the decline that threat-&#13;
ened the disappearance of many linesâ&#128;&#157; 35. Still the potential of railways is largely&#13;
unfulfilled. A new vision is needed to express this potential and for railways to&#13;
â&#128;&#156;emerge as an attractive transportation alternative for Africa in some specific mar-&#13;
ketsâ&#128;&#157;23. This vision requires for railways to be accepted as a business and not con-&#13;
sidered as a public service, a concept which has brought railway companies to fi-&#13;
nancial bankruptcy; for governments to continue playing a role in providing the&#13;
enabling environment which includes support to affordable investment 36 and at&#13;
the same time unbiased land transport policies for fair competition among modes.&#13;
Those key principles can be the foundation of long-term development plans where&#13;
railways can bring benefits to the countries and the global economy beyond their&#13;
transport role, in particular through their low carbon performance reducing the&#13;
impact of transport on climate change.&#13;
&#13;
Port sector&#13;
Port sector reforms have largely been more effective than continued government&#13;
operations due to a more business-like approach, closer interaction with the rest of&#13;
the world, leading consequently to a better knowledge of good practices. The port&#13;
business is also less risky as most of its market is captive which, on the other side&#13;
does reduce the incentive to perform and can generate undue costs to the econo-&#13;
my. There are no doubt opportunities to improve port reform models, but in-&#13;
creased private sector operation of port terminals, guided by appropriate policy&#13;
and regulation, will remain a key pillar of the reforms in the future. Like railways,&#13;
the challenge will be to put in place policies ensuring affordability at the higher&#13;
level of the country and not only at the level of the port, while providing competi-&#13;
tive and viable services. Regional Economic Communities will also have a critical&#13;
role to play in providing a regional vision promoting the competition among cor-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  In this respect, in the current debate on the various standards for the railway gauge, it will&#13;
be important to acknowledge that the gauge is not an objective in itself and should not be a&#13;
political decision. The objective is not to provide a gauge but to provide a service, which is&#13;
competitive, affordable and viable from the both public and private points of view.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ridors, which will mitigate the risk of rent-seeking situations and high costs in cap-&#13;
tive markets.&#13;
&#13;
Corridor transit traffic&#13;
The extent to which corridor management initiatives have been effective is not&#13;
clear. There has been more than enough analysis done over the years on the chal-&#13;
lenges facing transit traffic. Solutions are known but few are implemented to ad-&#13;
dress the problems. The main challenge remains the conflict between the short-&#13;
term vested interest of countries and the broader long-term benefit for the region.&#13;
&#13;
The institutional framework for regional integration is one of the keys to better&#13;
performance of regional corridors. It reflects this unresolved conflict as Regional&#13;
Economic Communities and corridor management authorities do not have the&#13;
authority to implement their decisions. Political commitment of countries is defi-&#13;
nitely a requirement for improved corridor performance but is not enough for&#13;
sustaining this improvement as it is often volatile. A proper institutional frame-&#13;
work is required to consolidate and sustain this progress. However, this goes be-&#13;
yond the transport sectorâ&#128;&#153;s capability of reform and the transport sector will have&#13;
to partner with other sectors such as trade, agriculture and industry to move the&#13;
institutional reform agenda.&#13;
&#13;
The benefit of this coordinated approach will also be to make more apparent the&#13;
contribution from the transport sector to broader development objectives beyond&#13;
transport. The approach could take place within the concept of integrated eco-&#13;
nomic development along corridors. Africa has started to develop this concept&#13;
along a few corridors but the approach remains fragmented and at the early stages&#13;
of implementation. More time is needed to provide the evidence of success.&#13;
&#13;
Still a first step essential to support reforms is to set up corridor performance&#13;
monitoring systems as this is generally not well done (with some notable excep-&#13;
tions). Poor governance is at the crux of poor corridor performance. An M&amp;E&#13;
system will bring more transparency as well as accountability and will strengthen&#13;
political commitments by bringing the proof of success.&#13;

&#13;
Transport and the global development agenda&#13;
&#13;
To become part of a globalized world, the transport sector in Africa will need to&#13;
take up the challenge of achieving the transport targets of the sustainable devel-&#13;
opment goals (SDG) 37. Transport was ignored in the Millennium Development&#13;
Goals with significant consequences in terms of sector development and funding&#13;
but also in terms of overall economic development. Africa brought it back by&#13;
promoting the Rural Access Index but then failed in implementing the vision of&#13;
improved rural accessibility. With the SDGs, another opportunity opens to devel-&#13;
op transport policies to respond to the more ambitious development agenda of&#13;
Africa. The transport sector must not repeat the past mistake of ignoring the&#13;
MDGs and needs to embrace the sustainable development goals as the broad de-&#13;
velopment framework that guides its policies.&#13;
&#13;
This focus on the SDGs will address the findings of the Review which suggest that&#13;
higher level pro-poor pro-growth objectives for the transport sector would have&#13;
greater impact if: (a) the causal link between transport and these high level out-&#13;
comes is properly established; (b) performance of the transport sector against pro-&#13;
poor, pro-growth and cross-cutting theme objectives is proactively measured; (c)&#13;
efforts to track performance against such objectives would not place further strains&#13;
on the already capacity-constrained monitoring and evaluation processes (e.g. by&#13;
having pragmatic and less onerous indicators). This would appropriately demon-&#13;
strate that the transportation sector plays an important but indirect and implicit&#13;
role in economic growth and poverty alleviation and measure the transport con-&#13;
tribution to these higher-level objectives.&#13;
&#13;
Still more research on the poverty and growth impacts of transport and the role of&#13;
transport in HIV/AIDS, gender equity, the environment, among other cross-&#13;
cutting themes would be a worthwhile pursuit. As acknowledged in the SSATP&#13;

more research likely needs to be undertaken to identify the types of transport poli-&#13;

jectives. This could then inform future transport policy and investment prioritiza-&#13;
tion frameworks at the country level. The SSATP or academic institutions would&#13;
be well placed to lead such research and then disseminate it to policy makers in the&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This working paper summarizes the key
            findings of the African Transport Policy Performance Review,
            carried out by SSATP in selected Anglophone and Francophone
            countries in 2013. It highlights the performance of
            transport policies focusing on the main transportation
            modes, excluding maritime and aviation, and is augmented by
            outcomes of related work carried out mainly by SSATP and the
            World Bank. The key objective is to convey the salient
            messages, and to point out the need for more
            transformational and pragmatic transport policy objectives
            and strategies, in an effort to enhance the efficiency and
            competitiveness of the sector. The paper addresses some
            fundamental policy issues, that affect transport performance
            in Sub-Saharan African countries and is intended for
            transport sector policy level decision-makers.
