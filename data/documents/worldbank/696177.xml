REPUBLIC OF CROATIA&#13;
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT AND MINE CLEARING PROJECT&#13;
I.     THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
1.    The primary objectives of the Project are to: (1) repair and reconstruct the surface&#13;
transport networks within Croatia and between Croatia and BiH and (2) clear landmines in areas of&#13;
high economic priority for reconstruction. By rebuilding the transport system, it is expected that&#13;
delivery of construction materials to BiH will be accelerated and that the traditional regional trade&#13;
patterns will be reestablished. The repair and reconstruction of local transport networks will also&#13;
provide some of the critical elements needed for the return of refugees and displaced persons.&#13;
Clearing of landmines is an essential first step in the repair and reconstruction of infrastructure&#13;
networks, in the rebuilding of other facilities (such as schools and clinics) and in the return of&#13;
refugees and displaced persons to their homes.&#13;
Project Design and Description&#13;
2.     The Project is part of a post-war infrastructure reconstruction program supported by three&#13;
projects: (1) reconstruction of regional transport systems and clearing of landmines (the object of&#13;
this report,) (2) rebuilding of regional water supply and sewerage networks, and (3) reconstruction&#13;
of major infrastructure in the Eastern Slavonia region of Croatia. The first two projects are largely&#13;
regional in nature, benefiting users in both Croatia and BiH. The Eastern Slavonia project would&#13;
focus on infrastructure needed locally, but would also rebuild facilities needed for improved&#13;
economic ties with neighboring countries. The water and sewerage project is in the final stages of&#13;
preparation and will be presented once final agreement has been reached between Croatia and BiH&#13;
on the arrangements for implementation and, if applicable, agreements concerning on-lending and&#13;
repayment of funds. Initial preparatory work has also begun on the project in Eastem Slavonia.&#13;
Among other issues, consideration will be given to the mechanisms for implementation and&#13;
supervision of the project during the remaining period of the transitional administration.&#13;
3.     The proposed Emergency Transport and Mine Clearing Project will cover the first phase of&#13;
the reconstruction program. The transport sector was selected for Bank support since the needed&#13;
agreements between Croatia and BiH have been signed and the joint implementation committee has&#13;
been established and begun work. Design of the major investments has been completed and agreed&#13;
and preparation of tenders await only the approval of the proposed Loan. (Additional information&#13;
on fimding of the transport investments is discussed under Project Implementation.) The Project&#13;
finances only investments that could be implemented within a period of two to three years and does&#13;
not include major upgrading of infrastructure or sector restructuring. Such larger investments have&#13;
been left to separate projects under initial stages of preparation, for example, for Croatian railways&#13;
and ports. Clearing of landmnines is included in the Project as a necessary component of the&#13;
reconstruction program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 2 OF 32&#13;
4.     The proposed Project investments are:&#13;
Transport Component&#13;
*  Roads and Bridges: Repair and reconstruction of the Zupanja-Orasje bridge (the parts of the&#13;
bridge located in the territory of Croatia) which crosses the Sava River into BiH from eastern&#13;
Croatia, 130 kms of roads and about 30 road bridges primarily through Lika and Cordun in the&#13;
former UNPA areas, and upgraded road access to Ploce Port. The estimated cost for roads and&#13;
bridges, excluding contingencies, is US$ 33.8 million.&#13;
*  Railways: Reconstruction of the Lika line (Ostarije-Knin-Split/Zadar) and the Novska-Sisak&#13;
line. The investments on the Lika line will consist of the Debeljak tunnel at Skabrnje near&#13;
Zadar, safety equipment at the Skabmje station, 9 automated barriers at road crossings along&#13;
the line, renewal of 45 kms of track, and spare parts for 15 locomotives. On the Novska-Sisak&#13;
line, two rail bridges (over the Strug and Sava Rivers) will be rebuilt. The estimated cost for&#13;
railways, excluding contingencies, is US$ 23.6 million.&#13;
*  Ploce Port: Repairs and reconstruction of Pier 5 (main pier) and Pier 3, the pier ladder and&#13;
fendering system, the roll-on-roll-off terminal, container handling equipment, and various war&#13;
damages to equipment, piers and buildings. The estimated cost for the investments at the Port,&#13;
excluding contingencies, is US$ 18.6 million.&#13;
Mine Clearing Component&#13;
e Clearing of mines im areas of high priority for economic reconstruction (with first priority to&#13;
Project areas,) quality assurance of cleared areas, initial screening based on mine maps,&#13;
surveys to estimate the probability of areas being contaminated by mines, and technical&#13;
assistance, including training for mine clearers, instructors, and possibly dogs, where such&#13;
dogs are trained to identify the location of mines. Total investments in mine clearing, excluding&#13;
contingencies, will be US$ 27.2 million.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
5.     The Project Implementation Plan is included as Chapter IV of the Technical Annex. The&#13;
Project will be implemented by the agencies directly responsible for the respective programs.&#13;
Project Indicators&#13;
6.     As an emergency operation, the relevant Project indicators relate to speed of procurement&#13;
and Project implementation. These are: (1) percentage of Project funds committed by supplier&#13;
contract; (2) funds disbursement (including issuance of Bank Special Commitments;) and (3)&#13;
percentage of completion of Project.&#13;

TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 3 OF 32&#13;
I.    TRANSPORT COMPONENT&#13;
Background&#13;
7.     Traditionally Croatia has provided one of the main east-west transport links between&#13;
western Europe and the Balkans. Since 1991, war has disrupted many of these links. Much of the&#13;
main transport infrastructure was damaged due to war activities or deferred maintenance. With the&#13;
signing of the Washington Accords in early 1994, the Government of Croatia began to rebuild the&#13;
transport infrastructure. Following the approval of the Dayton Accords in December 1995 and the&#13;
end of hostilities in the region, the Govemrnment began a full-scale reconstruction program.&#13;
8.     Due to its central location, Croatia's infrastructure constitutes an essential part of the&#13;
transport network for the regional economy, including BiH and Serbia. The regional network&#13;
includes: the road and rail lines from Zagreb to Belgrade, the rail lines from Rijeka to Hungary, the&#13;
road and rail bridges across the Sava and Una Rivers into Bosnia, and the sea-port at Ploce in&#13;
southern Croatia. In addition, the Government of Croatia has initiated a program to repair and&#13;
reconstruct the roads and bridges running parallel to the Adriatic through Lika and Cordun. These&#13;
lines are located in the former Sectors North and South and, until 1995, were not accessible to the&#13;
Government of Croatia.&#13;
9.     Following the signing of the Dayton Accords, NATO has rebuilt (or plans to rebuild) parts&#13;
of the transport network, as needed to move troops and supplies into Bosnia. IFOR has built two&#13;
temporary pontoon bridges at Zupanja-Orasje in eastern Croatia and has plans to put in place a&#13;
temporary rail bridge at Volinja between Bosanski Kostajnica and Bosanski Novi in northeastern&#13;
Bosnia. While the bridges provided a quick means of handling military (and some civilian) traffic,&#13;
traffic capacity is limited. To serve the needs of the regional economy, it will be necessary to&#13;
replace the IFOR bridges with permanent facilities capable of handling normal traffic loads.&#13;
10.    Since the 1960s, the Bank has been lending to Croatia (as part of the former Yugoslavia)&#13;
for the transport sector. The Bank provided a loan in March 1995 for the Highway Sector Project&#13;
(Loan Number 3869-HR) to finance building of the roads system in the areas then under&#13;
Government control. In addition, the Bank has begun preparation on projects for the railways and&#13;
ports. However, the transition to a market economy has meant substantial and material&#13;
restructuring of the railways and ports in order to reduce the annual subsidies needed. To assist in&#13;
the preparation of such restructuring, consultants' studies are underway and are expected to be&#13;
completed by late 1996. The proposed program is independent of the outcome of the studies and&#13;
will cover repairs and reconstruction that will be needed regardless of the details of the future&#13;
sector strategy for the railways and the ports.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
11.    The primary objective of the transport component of the Project is to finance the repair and&#13;
rebuilding of essential regional transport infrastructure. The Project will: rebuild a major surface&#13;
transport link between eastem Croatia and north-eastem Bosnia, upgrade the primary seaport&#13;
(Ploce Port) serving Bosnia, and repair and rebuild the road and rail networks needed to improve&#13;
efficiency of transport throughout Croatia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TEC}INICAL ANNEX PAGE 4 OF 32&#13;
Design&#13;
12.    The Project design focuses on the crucial investments needed immediately by both Croatia&#13;
and BiH for the reconstruction of the regional economy. Care was taken to ensure to avoid the&#13;
major investments in rehabilitation and upgrading of transport infrastructure where such&#13;
investments should be made only following the completion and full review of the sector&#13;
restructuring studies. This particularly applies to the railways and the ports investments for the&#13;
Project.&#13;
Description&#13;
Roads and Bridges&#13;
13.   The Project will cover investments for roads and bridges, railways, and for the Port at&#13;
Ploce. The most crucial investments for roads and bridges will cover: the Zupanja-Orasje bridge&#13;
across the Sava River, roads and bridges primarily through Lika and Cordun, and the road access&#13;
to the Ploce Port.&#13;
14.    The Zupanja-Orasje bridge represents the main road link between Croatia and north-&#13;
eastern Bosnia through Vukovar-Vinkovci-Tusla-Sarajevo. Almost 40 percent of the bridge has&#13;
been destroyed, including all the main upper structure crossing the river and the two central piers.&#13;
Only the structure in the north and south flood plains were undamaged. The existing foundations&#13;
were only slightly damaged. The program thus includes rebuilding a 304 meter bridge section and&#13;
constructing new piers using the existing foundations. The IFOR bridges built at Zupanja were&#13;
removed in March-April due to the Spring floods. All the road bridges to be rebuilt were damaged&#13;
or destroyed during the hostilities, with the amount of damage ranging from deterioration of&#13;
surfaces and railings to complete destruction of the bridge, including foundations. The average cost&#13;
for repairing the bridges is estimated at US$ 500,000 per bridge. In addition, about 130 kms of&#13;
roads through Lika and Cordun have been damaged or destroyed, due to shelling or deferred&#13;
investments. Many of the roads also provide access to the bridges noted above. The roads program&#13;
will also include construction of a new road to Ploce Port. The current road traverses the city of&#13;
Ploce, creating inefficiencies and hazards for both port and city traffic. The new access road of 2.3&#13;
kms joins the Port to the Adriatic Highway (M2) about 2 kms west of the Port.&#13;
Railways&#13;
15.    The railway components are located on two main lines, that is, the Lika line (Ostarije-&#13;
Knin-Split/Zadar) and the line between Zagreb and Belgrade. The investments foreseen for the&#13;
Lika line are:&#13;
* Skabrnje Station Safety Equipment. The Skabrnje station safety equipment was completely&#13;
destroyed during the war. The cable network was damaged and the building itself was burnt&#13;
down.&#13;
* Level Crossings. All 28 level crossings on the line were destroyed. All had light and sound&#13;
signals (some with and some without barriers.) Nine light signals with barriers on the crossings&#13;
will be installed on the roads with the heaviest traffic crossing the railway tracks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 5 OF 32&#13;
*  The Debeljak Tunnel. The Debeljak tunnel has a length of 1.3 kms and is located on the section&#13;
Skabrnje-Bibinje. During the war, a wagon full of explosives was placed on the line in the&#13;
direction of Zadar. The wagon exploded at the entry to the tunnel, destroying 70 meters of the&#13;
entry and 330 meters of the tunnel lining. Under the program, the tunnel will be rebuilt.&#13;
*  Track Renewal. On the Ostarije-Knin line, three sections totaling 45 kms have been selected&#13;
for renewal. The track on these sections is in bad condition. It was last repaired over 20 years&#13;
ago, and then with used material. The sections are: Ostarije-Plaski (20 kms) Gracac-Malovan&#13;
(6 kms) and Licko Lesce-Perusic (19 kms.)&#13;
*  Spare Parts. Spare parts for 15 locomotives will also be purchased, including diesel motors&#13;
and electrical equipment, air conditioning systems and electric heating equipment.&#13;
16.    On the Novska-Sisak line the repair of two bridges is included under the Project.&#13;
*  Strug River Bridge. This bridge is 110 meters long and has three spans. During the war the&#13;
first span structure was destroyed while the other two were damaged. The Project covers a full&#13;
repair of the bridge.&#13;
*  Sava River Bridge. The bridge and the damages and destruction are similar to that at the Strug&#13;
River bridge. Both bridges are located near Novska.&#13;
Ploce Port&#13;
17.    The Port of Ploce has historically served BiH as well as Hungary and Serbia. The war&#13;
reduced the traffic through the Port to about five percent of prewar levels. Port installations were&#13;
damaged by air and naval bombardments in 1992 and pier 5, the main facility for loading and&#13;
unloading bulk cargo, has been damaged due to lack of repair and maintenance, overloading, and&#13;
possibly original construction deficiencies. In its current state, Ploce Port is unable to handle more&#13;
than minimal levels of cargo traffic. The Project includes the following urgent investments.&#13;
*  Pier 5 Rehabilitation. In order to define and design the necessary works, consultants have been&#13;
engaged. They will also work out the bidding documents. The assignment started in June and&#13;
will take about four months. Financing is provided by the Dutch Government under a separate&#13;
project.&#13;
*  Handling Equipment. There is a need to replace the destroyed equipment and acquire&#13;
equipment to handle containers, that is, a mobile tired crane, a stacker, tractors, and trailers.&#13;
*  Repair of Various War Damages. Damages to be repaired were inflicted to mechanical&#13;
equipment as well as to buildings and piers. Repairs will be made to: the grain terminal,&#13;
warehouse 4A, pier cranes 2 and 3, repair of windows and doors in various buildings, pier 2&#13;
pavement, and warehouse 9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 6 oF 32&#13;
*  Pier Ladder and Fendering System. Pier ladders and a proper fendering system are lacking and&#13;
needed to allow for efficient operation of the Port. Relevant support is provided under the&#13;
Project.&#13;
*  Pier 3 Repairs. Pier 3, which is the oldest pier in the port, is in a poor condition with serious&#13;
deformations and risks a possible collapse. Part of the pier has already been rebuilt and the&#13;
remainder will be built as part of the Project.&#13;
*  Roll-on-roll-off Terminal Renewal. The roll-on-roll-off terminal, which dates from the 1960s is&#13;
located close to the main square of the town of Ploce. The terminal was used by tanks and&#13;
heavy military trucks. As a result, more than half of the pavement is broken or in poor&#13;
condition and will be repaired under the Project.&#13;

Financing Plan&#13;
19.    The total cost of the transport component of the Project is estimated at $88.3 million. The&#13;
Bank Loan will finance an average of 82 percent of the Project, that is, 80 percent of works and&#13;
100 percent of goods (excluding taxes and duties.) Costs not financed by the Bank Loan will be&#13;
covered by the state budget.&#13;

Implementation&#13;
20.   In the transport sector, roads and bridges will be implemented by Croatian Roads (HG,)&#13;
railways by Croatian Railways (HZ,) and ports by the Ploce Port Authority. For the transport&#13;
component, the MMTC is establishing a small Project Unit (PU) which will prepare all&#13;
disbursement requests for the transport component and will consolidate reports by the transport&#13;
agencies under the Project.&#13;
21.    The implementation schedules for the various investments reflect a three year program&#13;
(1996-98) with the major part of the activity falling in 1997. For many of the investments, designs&#13;
have been completed and the implementing agencies are ready to start (or have already begun)&#13;
procurement. For example, for the Zupanja-Orasje bridge, design for reconstruction has been&#13;
completed and some of the damaged pieces have been cleared from the river. However, for some&#13;
investments, such as the rehabilitation of pier 5 in Ploce Port and the repairs to the Lika railway,&#13;
construction might not be completed until the third quarter of 1999.&#13;
22.    For all investments except the Zupanja-Orasje bridge, implementation of the transport&#13;
investments in the proposed Project will be the sole responsibility of the Croatian agency, that is,&#13;
HC, HZ, or the Ploce Port Authority. For the bridge, the Governments of Croatia and Bosnia have&#13;
agreed that the costs will be shared 50:50 and have established a joint bridge commission to&#13;
implement the investment. Most of the work in procurement and implementation will be conducted&#13;
by HC and the joint commission will approve only final decisions for the program. Recognizing the&#13;
importance of close cooperation for the bridge, in March 1996, the Governments of Croatia and of&#13;
BiH signed a memorandum of understanding with regard to transport connections between Croatia&#13;
and BiH  (Attachment 1.) In April 1996, the Governments signed a resolution on joint&#13;
implementation. The resolution names the members of the eight person commission and the&#13;
responsibilities of the commission (Attachment 2.)&#13;
2   Excluding taxes and duties. Detailed numbers may not add to totals due to rounding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 9 OF 32&#13;
23.    For the Ploce Port, in May 1996 the Governments of Croatia and BiH signed an agreement&#13;
giving Bosnia access to the Adriatic Sea through Ploce (Attachment 3) and an agreement giving&#13;
Croatia passage through BiH at Neum (Attachment 4.) The Ploce agreement allows passage of&#13;
goods on a duty-free basis and ensures that tariffs at Ploce Port are set no higher than those&#13;
charged at other major Croatian ports (such as Rijeka.) Specific concession contracts will be&#13;
negotiated by private investors with the Port, and in the case of long-term concessions, with the&#13;
Government. The inter-governmental agreement provides a framework for such concessions and is&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. The agreement is in accordance with the 1982 Convention on the Law of&#13;
the Sea, the 1965 Convention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked Countries and the 1923&#13;
Convention and Statute on the International Regime of Maritime Ports.&#13;
24.    Procurement information provided to the Bank will include: prompt reporting of contract&#13;
award information, and comprehensive explanation of revised cost estimates for individual&#13;
contracts and the total Project, revised timing of procurement actions, and compliance with&#13;
aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement. During negotiations, agreement was reached&#13;
with the Government on all procurement arrangements.&#13;
Economic Evaluation&#13;
25.    Many of the components deal with repairing and putting into operation installations. These&#13;
repairs are prerequisites for the functioning of wider systems. This applies to most of the bridges&#13;
and the Ploce Port components as well as to the repair of railway installations which have been&#13;
directly or indirectly damaged through war activities such as the station installations and tunnel&#13;
repair. For such components no explicit economic evaluations have been carried out. For some of&#13;
the major components the Croatian authorities have carried out evaluations. These concern the&#13;
road rehabilitation, repair of the regional bridges and the Lika line track renewal. These&#13;
investments account for two-thirds of the total.&#13;
26.   Road Rehabilitation. The IRR (internal rate of return) varies from 14 to 49 percent. The&#13;
evaluation was prepared by Croatian authorities in accordance with conventional methods for this&#13;
type of works. The appraisal and results are included in the Project File.&#13;
27.    Regional Bridges. For this group, a system of ranking was established taking into account&#13;
the importance of the road section, forecasted traffic, route length without the bridge, importance&#13;
of reconstruction for the economy and environmental considerations. The results are included in the&#13;
Project File.&#13;
28.    Lika line Track Rehabilitation. In the feasibility study prepared by HZ, the economic rate&#13;
of return is estimated at 12 percent. The study is in the Project File.&#13;
Risks&#13;
29.   The risks involved mainly concem those investments which depend on an agreement&#13;
between Croatia and BiH. This concerns the Zupanja-Orasje bridge and the Ploce Port. For the&#13;
Zupanja-Orasje bridge an agreement between the two governments, spelling out the intentions and&#13;
principles for reconstructing the bridge, was signed on March 14, 1996. The Croatian/BiH&#13;
Implementation Commission foreseen in the agreement has been established. For the Port of Ploce,&#13;
as noted above, a bi-lateral framework agreement has been signed (May 1996.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 10 OF 32&#13;
III. MINE CLEARING COMPONENT&#13;
Background&#13;
30.    Landmine contamination is expected to be a problem for much of Croatia's program to&#13;
rebuild war-damaged infrastructure. At the end of 1995, there were an estimated three million&#13;
landmines, dispersed primarily along the 1,180 former lines of confrontation. The major areas&#13;
affected were former sectors south and north (Lika and Cordun) and sectors west and east&#13;
(Western and Eastem Slavonia.) The area south of Karlovac is thought to be heavily contaminated,&#13;
as it was previously used as a military training camp. Landmines were used as invisible barriers,&#13;
denying access to facilities of all kinds: residential housing, public buildings, agricultural land,&#13;
roads, railways, bridges, power and gas networks, water and sewerage systems. Most of the mines&#13;
are difficult to detect, since they were made primarily from plastic. Many of the existing minefield&#13;
maps and records are unreliable, many minefields have not been mapped, and some areas have&#13;
been mined and re-mined by both sides, in patterns which make subsequent detection difficult.&#13;
Clearing all the mines will take years, probably decades, and will be very costly. In addition,&#13;
considerable quantity of unexploded ordnance (perhaps as much as ten percent of all bombs)&#13;
remains along the former confrontation lines. All references in the text to mine clearing also apply&#13;
to ordnance disposal programs.&#13;
31.    Priority is being given to mine clearing in support of infrastructure reconstruction needs,&#13;
but the exercise is unlikely to cover all the priority sites. Until recently all de-mined areas were&#13;
cleared to military, rather than civilian (humanitarian) standards and will require verification.&#13;
Despite the efforts to date, the majority of mines have not yet been cleared and a major effort to&#13;
complete clearing is now required.&#13;
32.   In all the areas where there have been hostilities, particularly where there has not been&#13;
continual presence of civilians, there is a risk of mines and unexploded ordnance. The return of&#13;
displaced people and refugees, which is anticipated to gather momentum in the spring and summer&#13;
of 1997 lends added urgency to the problem. The presence of mines within towns as well as in&#13;
agricultural areas is cause for concern. In addition, no reconstruction of major infrastructure can&#13;
take place until their sites have been cleared of mines. The economic costs imposed by the delays in&#13;
the reconstruction and recovery program thus make the need for mine clearing urgent.&#13;
33.    Until recently, most mine clearing in Croatia was conducted by the army, with assistance&#13;
from local special defense forces. However, the Government of Croatia has recognized that mine&#13;
clearing for economic reconstruction and other civilian purposes should be conducted by civilian,&#13;
rather than military, organizations. In March 1996, Parliament approved the Act on Clearing of&#13;
Mines. Among other things, the Law provides for a state mine clearing company (MUNGOS)&#13;
under the MOI.&#13;
34.   In a plan prepared in January 1996 by the MOI and the Ministry of Reconstruction and&#13;
Development, the Government of Croatia described the proposed national mine clearing program.&#13;
The program summarizes the Govemment plans to establish a national mine clearing capability.&#13;
The program also sets out in general terms the proposed training of mine clearing staff and the&#13;
deployment of trained groups of mine clearers. The plan also identified clear priorities for mine&#13;
clearing. They are: facilities needed for economic reconstruction, power lines, rail and road&#13;
networks, public buildings, residential housing, and agricultural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 11 OF 32&#13;
Objectives and Design&#13;
35.   The objectives of the proposed program in mine clearing is to: (1) clear landmines in the&#13;
Project areas and (2) clear mines in other high priority areas needed for economic reconstruction.&#13;
The program will ensure rapid and efficient clearing of the areas for the investments in the&#13;
transport component and will provide a base for full development of the national capacity for mine&#13;
clearing. In preparing the mine clearing component of the Project, the Bank has been in close&#13;
coordination with the UN agencies directly involved in mine clearing, including the UN MAC in&#13;
Zagreb and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs in New York.&#13;
Description&#13;
36.    The investments will cover: mines in areas of high priority for economic reconstruction&#13;
(with first priority to Project areas,) quality assurance checking of cleared areas, initial screening&#13;
based on mine maps, surveys to estimate the probability of areas being contaminated by mines, and&#13;
technical assistance, including training for mine clearers, instructors, and possibly dogs, where&#13;
such dogs are trained to identify the location of mines.&#13;
Estimated Costs and Financing Plan&#13;

Implementation&#13;
38.   Implementation of the Mine Clearing program will be done through the MOI, which has&#13;
established a PU for the component. The mine clearing work will be completed by contractors&#13;
selected through a competitive process (i.e. ICB.) Possible bidders could include the state mine&#13;
clearing company (MUNGOS,) foreign mine clearing companies and joint ventures between&#13;
qualified foreign and domestic enterprises. The MOI will let contracts and evaluate bids.&#13;
39.   In addition, a specialized Quality Assurance Unit has been established in the Ministry.&#13;
Assisting the QA Unit will be representatives of the United Nations Mine Action Center (MAC) or&#13;
other internationally recognized technical experts, who will provide technical and implementation&#13;
advice to the QA Unit. (Draft terms of reference are included in Attachment 5.) The QA Unit will&#13;
set the standards to be met -- generally 99.6 percent of all mines -- and will review the standard&#13;
operating procedures of the contractors. In addition, the QA Unit will be responsible for conducting&#13;
QA of areas cleared by contractors or by others, such as military forces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 12 OF 32&#13;
40.    The Bank's experience in the mine clearing program for BiH can be applied for the&#13;
program in Croatia. In particular, the Bank's standard bidding documentation has been reviewed,&#13;
and for mnine clearing, customized to reflect the specific issues related to mine clearing contracts.&#13;
All mine clearing works will be procured using ICB (see Project Implementation Plan.)&#13;
Procurement of QA equipment will be conducted by ICB, NCB and LIB and contracts for&#13;
consultant services and other technical services will follow Bank guidelines on the hiring of&#13;
consultants. In addition, the MOI may require some technical assistance in procurement and in&#13;
administering and supervising contracts. For this, an external adviser should be hired for advice&#13;
and assistance and funded either by donors or the Ministry's budget. (Sample terms of reference&#13;
for the technical experts is included in Attachment 6.)&#13;
41.    Given that civilian mine clearing is a new activity in Croatia, the Ministry of the Interior is&#13;
reviewing acceptable quality targets for mine clearing and acceptable methods of clearing and of&#13;
establishing quality assurance. The targets and acceptable methods for mine clearing and quality&#13;
assurance will be included in the tender documents for bidders. A discussion of current mine&#13;
clearing techniques -- and some of the lessons learned -- is included in Attachments 7 and 8.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 13 OF 32&#13;
IV.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
42.    For the World Bank Loan of DM  150.9 million for an Emergency Transport and Mine&#13;
Clearing Project, the Borrower is the Government of Croatia represented by the Ministry of&#13;
Finance. It has been agreed that the Finance Ministry will delegate implementation responsibility to&#13;
the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications (MMTC) and the Ministry of&#13;
Interior (MOI.) A Project Coordinator within the Finance Ministry will be responsible only for&#13;
monitoring Project activities. Implementation of the Project (including all aspects of procurement&#13;
documentation and submission of disbursement requests) will be the responsibility of the&#13;
implementing agencies.&#13;
43.    The agencies responsible for the activities to be implemented under the Project are&#13;
described below. Apart from the MOI, all agencies have demonstrated capacity to successfully&#13;
implement the Bank procurement procedures, having completed procurement for other Bank&#13;
projects. Training in Bank procurement will be made available to the MOI as needed to ensure&#13;
smooth Project implementation.&#13;
*  MMTC - Within the MMTC, a Project Unit (PU) is being created. Two of the transport&#13;
agencies -- the Croatian Railways Company, the Croatian Roads Administration -- have&#13;
extensive experience with Bank procurement guidelines and have successfully implemented the&#13;
transport components of the Emergency Reconstruction Project. The Ploce Port Authority is a&#13;
new agency, but has staff experienced in Bank procurement procedures and will call on the&#13;
Roads Administration for assistance in procurement, as needed. It is expected that the Port&#13;
Authority will be able to efficiently conduct procurement for the Port investments. For&#13;
investments to be implemented under the transport component, the PU will consolidate reports&#13;
prepared by the direct implementing units and will submit disbursement requests to the Bank&#13;
for investments in the transport component.&#13;
*  MOI - Implementation of the Mine Clearing Component will be conducted by the MOI,&#13;
through the PU. Clearing of areas will be awarded by contracts, with selection by a&#13;
competitive tender to be conducted by the Ministry of the Interior. The MOI will also conduct&#13;
tenders for the purchase of QA equipment and will hire consultants as needed for training etc.&#13;
Since the Ministry has little experience in Bank procurement, technical assistance will likely be&#13;
needed for procurement and initial implementation of the Project.&#13;
44.    Project monitoring will be conducted by the Project Coordinator within the Finance&#13;
Ministry. The Project Coordinator was established under the Capital Markets Project and will have&#13;
also coordination responsibility for the Enterprise and Financial Sector Project and the related&#13;
Technical Assistance Project. (Under the Emergency Reconstruction Project, coordination was&#13;
provided by the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, HBOR, formerly HKBO, due&#13;
to the complexity of the Project and the large number of beneficiaries under the Emergency&#13;
Reconstruction Project.) In addition a procurement workshop will be held (in late October 1996)&#13;
with a focus on procurement of mine clearing contracts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 14 OF 32&#13;
45.    The Project Coordinator reports directly to the Assistant Minister of Finance. The&#13;
functions of the Project Coordinator are to: ensure preparation and distribution of consolidated&#13;
periodic reports to the relevant Government agencies and financial institutions; summarize&#13;
disbursement requests submitted by the beneficiary agencies to the Bank; prepare reports required&#13;
for the interim review and prepare recommendations for the reallocation of funds among Project&#13;
components, where funds have not been committed under supplier contracts; and ensure&#13;
preparation of the Government's contribution to the Implementation Completion Report (ICR.)&#13;
46.    The implementing agencies will be responsible for implementation of the parts of the&#13;
Project that include the hiring and supervision of consultants. The procurement process followed&#13;
will be in compliance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
47.    Due to the urgent nature of the Project, the program need to be contracted and supplied&#13;
quickly. Procurement will follow the Bank Guidelines developed for the Bosnian emergency&#13;
projects, except that ICB will be used for all contracts for works and goods over US$ 2 million&#13;
(rather than US$ 5 million as in the Bosnian program.)&#13;
48.    To the extent practicable, items to be procured under the Project have been grouped into&#13;
major packages to encourage competitive bidding. Under the Project, the proposed methods of&#13;
procurement will include International Competitive Bidding (ICB) National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) Limited International Bidding (LIB) and Direct Contracting (DC.) A General Procurement&#13;
Notice (GPN) will be published in The Development Business in October 1996.&#13;

TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 16 OF 32&#13;
Transport&#13;
Works&#13;
49.   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) Procurement packages for civil works exceeding&#13;
the equivalent of US$ 2 million per contract will be procured through ICB. In addition, where a&#13;
procurement package includes a subcomponent where the cost of a single section (such as a road&#13;
section) is estimated to exceed US$ 1 million, the full package will be bid under ICB procedures,&#13;
even if its estimated cost is less than US$ 2 million. (The limits of $ 2 million and $ 1 million were&#13;
set for the First Highway Transport Project for Croatia and the same limits will be maintained for&#13;
the proposed Project.) For the transport component, the equivalent of US$ 43.3 million for about&#13;
six ICB packages will finance civil works.&#13;
50.    All ICB  packages for civil works will be prequalified. The Bank's standard&#13;
prequalification documents will be followed. In the interests of expediency, the notice inviting&#13;
contractors to apply for prequalification will be published as part of the GPN. The information in&#13;
the completed questionnaires submitted by firms will be used to carry out their general&#13;
prequalification for different levels in terms of contract values. The prequalified firms will be listed&#13;
m a registry and the registry will remain open for additions and deletions over the course of Project&#13;
implementation. The prequalification criteria will be approved by the Bank.&#13;
51.    National Competitive Bidding (NCB) Packages of civil works contracts between US$ 1&#13;
million and US$ 2 million will be procured through NCB. With respect to roads and bridges, civil&#13;
works are dispersed and of small value (the equivalent of less than US$ 2 million per contract.)&#13;
Foreign bidders are unlikely to be interested because of the limited size of the contracts, the often&#13;
remote locations of the sites and the presence of competitive and strong domestic civil works&#13;
contractors.&#13;
52.    Direct Contracting (DC) will be used for the repair of existing structures, using&#13;
proprietary technology and equipment. For the transport component, DC will be used to finance&#13;
pre-stressed elements of up to three partially destroyed bridges. The bridges were built using&#13;
proprietary methods and the replacement elements will use the same technology. About three&#13;
packages will be procured for transport works for a total of $1.6 million.&#13;
Goods&#13;
53.   ICB will be followed for procurement packages estimated to cost more than US$ 2 million&#13;
per package. In the case of procurement of goods through ICB, eligible domestic firms will be&#13;
accorded a preference margin equal to 15 percent or the prevailing duty (for the purpose of bid&#13;
evaluation only) whichever is lower, in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. For&#13;
the transport component, packages for goods and materials equivalent to US$ 2.3 million for one&#13;
or two packages will be procured through ICB.&#13;
54.    DC will be used for proprietary items, where justified to maintain compatibility and&#13;
standardization and where the Bank agrees procurement can be made only from the original&#13;
suppliers. For the transport component, DC will be used for spare parts for rail locomotives. DC&#13;
will cover about 2 packages for an aggregate value of $ 2.3 million. DC not identified in the&#13;
procurement plan will be subject to the Bank's prior approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX PAGE 17 OF 32&#13;
Mine Clearing&#13;
55.   Because of the urgent nature of the Project, procurement for the mine clearing program&#13;
will follow the expedited procurement procedures developed for emergency projects in BIH. Works&#13;
will cover contracts for clearing mines in specified areas. All works for mine clearing will be&#13;
procured through ICB (with no preference margin for domestic firms.)&#13;
56.   Mine clearing equipment will be financed through ICB, NCB  and LIB. Limited&#13;
International Bidding (LIB) that is, tendering by invitation, will be used to finance specialized&#13;
mine detection equipment, such as protective clothing, which is only available from a limited&#13;
number of suppliers worldwide. The list of LIB bidders will be based on expressions of interest&#13;
received in response to the GPN as well as other sources, including the direct experience of the&#13;
implementing agency. For goods under mine clearing component, about three packages totaling&#13;
$4.2 million will be financed through ICB, two totaling $3.2 million by NCB and about four&#13;
packages totaling $6.0 million by LIB.&#13;
57.   In addition, for the mine clearing component, consulting services will be used for training,&#13;
mine surveys and mine awareness programs consisting of about four packages with an aggregate&#13;
value of $0.7 million. Consulting Services will be procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
Procurement Review and Use of Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
58.   The Bank will conduct a prior review of procurement documentation for all ICB, LIB, DC,&#13;
for first two NCB packages, in accordance with paras. 2 and 4 of Appendix I of the Bank's&#13;
guidelines. Procurement documentation for contracts with consulting firms procured competitively&#13;
and exceeding US$ 200,000 per contact will also be subject to the Bank's prior review. For&#13;
consultants hired as individuals (rather than through companies) the prior review threshold will be&#13;
US$ 50,000. Follow up assignments will be permissible to the extent that this is indicated in the&#13;
initial terms of reference for the assignment.&#13;
59.   The Bank's standard bidding documents will be used, although the period allowed for&#13;
submission of bids may be reduced to four weeks. With regard to mine clearing works, the bidding&#13;
documents prepared for the Bosnian mine clearing program will be adapted for Croatia. For the&#13;
Bosnian prograrn, a section on requirements specific to landmine clearing was added to the bidding&#13;
documents with the technical specifications. The documents have been shown to OPR, in advance&#13;
of the requirement that will come into effect under the proposed Operational Guidelines for projects&#13;
that include financing for landmine clearing. OPR has cleared the documents for the Bosnian Mine&#13;
Clearing Project.&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
60.   In order to accelerate the Project, the Loan will allow for retroactivc financing for up to&#13;
$17.5 million equivalent. Retroactive financing could be used for procurement within four months&#13;
prior to expected Loan signing, where such procurement followed Bank guidelines. Retroactive&#13;
financing will be used for reconstruction of the Sava River bridge at Zupanja-Orasje and repairs&#13;
and rehabilitation to the Lika rail line for amounts contracted prior to August 1, 1996.&#13;
&#13;

Disbursements/Statements of Expenditure&#13;
61.    To facilitate timely Project implementation, MTTC and MOI will each establish, maintain,&#13;
and operate under conditions acceptable to tie Bank a special account in Deutsche Marks to be&#13;
held in a commercial bank, in the Central Bank, or with HBOR. The authorized allocations of the&#13;
special accounts will be limited to DM 19.3 million for the transport component's account and DM&#13;
10.4 million for the mine clearing component's account. Replenishment applications should be&#13;
submitted monthly, or more frequently as needed, and should be accompanied by reconciled bank&#13;
statements or other appropriate documentation.&#13;
62.    Disbursements will be made against Statements of Expenditure for: (a) goods and works&#13;
up to US$1 million equivalent (b) consulting services up to US$200,000 equivalent; (c) individual&#13;
consultants' services up to US$50,000 and (d) all training expenditures for which detailed&#13;

Accounts and Audits&#13;
65.    Separate and auditable Project accounts will be established by each of the implementing&#13;
agencies. The Project accounts will consist of: a record of all withdrawals with copies of&#13;
disbursement requests and supporting documentation, and a record of transactions of the special&#13;
account and the copies of the bank statements for the special account. Documentation for Project&#13;
accounts will be maintained for one year after the accounts had been audited.&#13;
66.    The Project accounts will be audited at the end of the Borrower's fiscal year. The audits&#13;
will be conducted by independent auditors under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Separate audit statements will be prepared for the special account and statements of expenditures.&#13;
All audit reports will be made available to the Bank no later than six months after the end of the&#13;
Borrower's fiscal year.&#13;
Reporting and Supervision&#13;
67.    The MMTC and the MOI will each prepare and furnish to the Project Coordinator a&#13;
quarterly progress report showing the status of implementation of the Project in a format&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The Project Coordinator will consolidate the information presented by the&#13;
implementing agencies and submit to the Bank a consolidated report (as well as the reports from&#13;
the individual implementing agencies.) Project implementation will incorporate maximnum&#13;
flexibility in view of the fact that the Project may need to be adapted to changing circumstances.&#13;
Implementation progress will be reviewed at the end of 12 months after effectiveness, that is just&#13;
before the mid-term of the Project. The review will assess the need for any adjustments based on&#13;
the implementation experience to date. In light of the need for expedited implementation of the&#13;
Project, supervision missions will be conducted approximately every three months after&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;

MINE CLEARING AGENCY&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROCUREMENT / IMPLEMENTATION ADVISER&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
The Government will be responsible for the implementation of mine clearing policies and&#13;
programs within Croatia, and will carry out its mine clearing commitments through the Ministry of&#13;
Interior (MOI.) However the mine action programs will affect many other Government agencies,&#13;
specifically those responsible for the roads and railways networks. Although these agencies are&#13;
experienced in the World Bank's procurement procedures, the letting and implementation of&#13;
contracts for mine clearing is a specialized area, and MOI will become the focal point for the&#13;
letting, implementation and monitoring of all mine clearing contracts, whether carried out by&#13;
Croatian mine clearing agencies or specialized intemational companies.&#13;
Although the MOI has been tasked with setting up a structure necessarv to establish,&#13;
implement and monitor mine clearing programs, they have little previous experience in these&#13;
processes, and initially will need some guidance in the more specialized areas involved, such as the&#13;
letting of contracts, and the measures necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of the&#13;
contract, especially in the areas of maintenance of safety standards and Quality Assurance.&#13;
The exact method of contracting for mine and munitions clearing has not yet been&#13;
determined. There are two main options- the letting of clearing contracts centrally, or the letting of&#13;
contracts for clearing by the reconstruction company on whose behalf the mine clearing is being&#13;
carried out. Whichever option is chosen, advice will be sought from the MOI, either by the&#13;
agencies or the reconstruction contractors, and the MOI may still insist on the Quality Assurance&#13;
aspects of the clearing function being carried out under central arrangements, to ensure uniform&#13;
high standards of clearing.&#13;
Duties&#13;
As Procurement Adviser, the Consultant will be responsible for ensuring that the&#13;
procurement and implementation of all contracted mine and munitions clearing services are carried&#13;
out in a timely and effective manner, so that the clearing can be carried out in advance of contracts&#13;
for roads and railway reconstruction, and so that the reconstruction programs for these services can&#13;
be carried out without threat of mine and munitions hazard to the reconstruction contractor's staff&#13;
and equipment. The Consultant will report to the head of the MOI Project Unit responsible for the&#13;
Project.&#13;
a.     On his wav to Croatia, the Consultant should visit the World Bank's headquarters in&#13;
Washington for consultations with the Procurement Specialist, the Project Manager, and the Sector&#13;
Task Manager for Transportation. He should also make contact by phone with the Task Manager&#13;
for Mine Clearing.&#13;
b.     Bid Preparation The Consultant will assist MOI in preparing bids for contracted mine&#13;
clearing programs, to be carried out either centrally or as part of an infrastructure reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 6 page 2 of 2&#13;
project. He should also prepare invitations packages for Quality Assurance monitoring and&#13;
assessment, where these functions are to be carried out by a specialized contractor.&#13;
c.     Bid Issue The Consultant will assist MOI in inviting bids from qualified mine clearing and&#13;
Explosive Ordnance Disposal companies, following the procurement guidelines of the World Bank.&#13;
d.     Evaluation and Contract Negotiation The Consultant will advise and assist in the&#13;
establishment of a bid evaluation committee, composed of suitably qualified experts, to verify&#13;
compliance of bids received with the tender requirements, and to assess the likelv technical&#13;
competence of the bidders. The bid evaluation committee will prepare evaluation reports with&#13;
reconmmendations on contract award. As required, the Consultant will arrange for, and in&#13;
conjunction with the MOI, will carry out the necessary contract negotiations.&#13;
e.     Advice to the MOI The Consultant will advise and assist the MOI on procurement matters,&#13;
as needed, throughout the period of assignment. The Consultant will also train the local&#13;
procurement staff in the MOI on all matters pertaining to the letting and implementation of&#13;
contracts, and the special considerations to be borne in mind for mine and explosive ordnance&#13;
clearing contracts. In conjunction with the Mine Action Program Manager and the Task Manager&#13;
for Mine Clearing, the Consultant will assist the MOI in setting up a structure within MOI for&#13;
supervising c6ntracts, and for carrying out Quality Assurance procedures.&#13;
f      Monitoring and Reporting The Consultant will advise the MOI on matters related to&#13;
monitoring and reporting, particularly in respect of reporting progress on clearing to the mine&#13;
information section of the Mine Action headquarters. The Consultant will also ensure the reporting&#13;
of progress by the contractors in accordance with the terms of the contracts.&#13;

NOTES ON MLNE CLEARING TECH NIQUES AND TECHNOLOGY&#13;
Mine Clearing Capacity&#13;
There are several sources from which mine clearers can be drawn. Each has advantages&#13;
and disadvantages:&#13;
M Military teams: Local militarv teams have been conducting mine clearing since the&#13;
conflict, but their utility is often problematic because donors and reconstruction&#13;
program managers have little control over military cleanrng priorities and standards.&#13;
Donors and aid organizations in general are reluctant to fund military organizations.&#13;
Military teams are, in general, experienced in laying mines or in breaching minefields&#13;
but do not have experience in clearing mines to a high standard (to humanitarian or&#13;
civilian standards), and this has caused accidents. Nor do they have any incentive to&#13;
clear mines to a high standard without receiving additional pay. Difficulties in&#13;
monitoring military operations is also a consideration.&#13;
*  Police and civil defense: these have an important and continuing role in responding to&#13;
emergency calls for assistance, especially in situations involving an isolated mine or&#13;
unexploded bomb. Civil defense teams have usuallv operated on a volunteer basis&#13;
through the war, and typically need to return to their normal employment after the war.&#13;
*  Commercial mine clearing companies: commercial mine clearing organizations are&#13;
typically formed in response to the large-scale need for mine clearing as a result of&#13;
protracted hostilities. Several such companies exist internationally, with experience&#13;
developed in Angola and/or Cambodia, for example, but they vary in experience and&#13;
competence.&#13;
*  Explosive ordnance disposal teams: In Croatia, some local commercial specialized&#13;
companies were still carrying out disposal activities from time to time on WWII&#13;
ordnance, but large-scale mine clearing requires a different organizational approach&#13;
from unexploded ordnance, for which additional training is necessary.&#13;
*  Non-governmental organization (NGO) mine clearing teams: NGO mine clearing&#13;
teams have considerable experience, and may be willing to assist in mine clearing&#13;
programs, and can often (but not always) offer lower prices, because of voluntary or&#13;
donor countrv contributions. They tend to be familiar with civilian (humanitarian)&#13;
clearing requirements, and can design their programs to train and use local personnel;&#13;
but they operate on a smaller scale than commercial companies.&#13;
*  Local "developmental" mine clearing capacity: A local capacity, trained in civilian&#13;
mine clearing standards, is essential to address the wide-scale and long-term needs of&#13;
Croatia. Although this capacity may not initially be sufficient to address the most&#13;
immediate needs, it is important that international assistance focuses on local&#13;
management and training from the beginning, so that local teams and companies can&#13;
play an increasing role as the overall mine clearing program is developed.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 7 page 2 of 4&#13;
Mine Detection Methods&#13;
The choice of technology depends on the task, and no method is effective for clearing all&#13;
mines. In practice, several methods of mine clearing may be used, and several methods of detection&#13;
used in sequence to improve coverage.&#13;
Manual probing: Due to the preponderance of non-metallic or minimum metallic&#13;
mines throughout the former Yugoslavia, the primary mine detection is -mine probing"&#13;
supplemented by magnetic mine detection. This involves the insertion of a lightweight&#13;
mine probe or prodder into the ground, at an angle of 300, to a depth of 100 mm.&#13;
repeated every 3 cm across the area being searched. The operator uses the probe to&#13;
feel for hard objects buried under the surface. The insertion angle of 300 is intended to&#13;
minimize the risk of the operator inadvertently pressing on the top of the mine. A&#13;
trained mine clearer can expect to clear about 2m2 per hour using this method.&#13;
* Mine sensing dogs: Dogs can be trained to react to the smell of explosives, thus&#13;
indicating the presence of mines. In mine clearing, the primary use of dogs is to screen&#13;
large areas very quickly. and allow mine clearers to focus operations on the areas&#13;
where the dogs indicate the presence of mines. The dogs require skilled handlers who&#13;
are able to interpret their signals and maximize their limited endurance. Mechanical&#13;
enhancements to dog-detecting operations are increasingly becoming available (e.g..&#13;
collecting samples of materials, with the location of the samples recorded. and then&#13;
using dogs to detect the presence of explosives). Vapor emission detection systems&#13;
have also been developed, but none vet have the sensitivities of a trained dog.&#13;
-  Satellite or aerial photography: Detection of mined areas depends on the&#13;
identification of systematic or unusual disturbance of the earth. This method is only&#13;
effective for identifying relatively recent disturbances in open countrv. Ground&#13;
verification is required: and within the mined area, individual mines still need to be&#13;
located. No system has yet been demonstrated that will successfully detect mines in the&#13;
Croatian environrment.&#13;
Mine Clearing Devices&#13;
* Mechanical clearing devices, such as flails are rarely able to guarantee a level of&#13;
clearing greater than 80%. Although thev offer fast coverage, they require skilled&#13;
operators and are greatly affected by the type of terrain they encounter. They may be&#13;
used in support of manual clearing operations, but may not, on their own, provide the&#13;
necessary level of clearing. For example, mechanical methods may be used as a&#13;
proving (testing or verification) method in areas where mines are suspected, as part of&#13;
the quality assurance process after manual clearing operations, as part of a route&#13;
clearing operation, or to clear vegetation before manual clearing.&#13;
* Explosive clearing devices, such as fuel-air explosives or explosive hoses, have a&#13;
limited effective range and a large explosive area, they can damage infrastructure in&#13;
the mined area, and are difficult to deploy in areas covered by vegetation or rocks, or&#13;
in built-up areas. Their effectiveness is greatlv reduced when deployed against blast-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

resistant mirnes. They are therefore regarded as breaching devices and are not&#13;
considered suitable for use in normnal civilian operations. They are also several orders&#13;
of magnitude more expensive than manual clearing.&#13;
* Mine protected vehicles are not clearing devices, but are a valuable asset to mine&#13;
clearing operations. particularly to reconnaissance parties attempting to assess the&#13;
extent of mined or possibly mined areas. They can also transport goods and personnel&#13;
over routes which may be mined, thus facilitating reconstruction even while demining&#13;
is taking place. As such, they are valuable life-saving equipment for those operating in&#13;
mine contaminated areas.&#13;
* Other methods. Other devices mav be appropriate where the potential user can&#13;
demonstrate that the equipment can achieve the necessary level of clearing.&#13;
Considerable research and development needs to be undertaken to identify and develop&#13;
faster means of detecting the presence of minimum metallic mines; at present, no such&#13;
technology is yet suitable for field use. Any proposal for the use of new technology&#13;
needs to be accompanied by substantial proof that it is capable of reaching the&#13;
minimum clearing standard for civilian mine clearing operation.&#13;
Mine Clearing Standards&#13;
- Military mine clearing. Many soldiers (particularly field or combat engineers) are&#13;
trained in minefield breaching operations. carried out to -'punch a hole" through a&#13;
minefield during combat. A minefield breach is normally carried out in support of an&#13;
immediate tactical objective. and mav involve a situation where the local commander&#13;
judges that the risk of breaching the minefield, with whatever resources are available,&#13;
is necessary in view of the tactical aims -- given that minefields, like other military&#13;
obstacles, are often covered by defensive fire under such circumstances. A minefield&#13;
breaching operation mav result in significant casualties among the conducting troops&#13;
or subsequent users. Mine breaching techniques are designed for speed, and often&#13;
merely push mines aside without destroying them. Thev are therefore rarely suitable&#13;
for civilian mine clearing operations.&#13;
* Civilian (humanitarian) mine clearing standards. For civilian use of land, there is no&#13;
-acceptable" level of residual landmine contamination. However, although 100%&#13;
clearing is the objective of all civilian mine clearing efforts, a total guarantee that all&#13;
the mines have been removed will never be given by any reputable mine clearer. The&#13;
UN advocates that humanitarian mine clearing operations should aim to achieve 100%&#13;
clearing, with a minimum standard "in excess of 99% clear." At present, the only&#13;
method capable of providing this level of clearing is manual clearing using mine&#13;
probes supported (but not replaced by) mine detectors and sniffing dogs. The other&#13;
military or mechanical methods described above may be used to complement manual&#13;
mine clearing, particularly in survey or "proving" operations intended to establish&#13;
whether mines are present. They should not be regarded as primary means of mine&#13;
clearing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 7 page 4 of 4&#13;
Quality Assurance&#13;
Mine and munitions clearing must be done with great thoroughness, to prevent mines or&#13;
munitions being missed during the clearing process, which could result in tragic accidents, and a&#13;
collapse of confidence in the value of the work done. No mine clearing organization can ever&#13;
guarantee that all mines and munitions have been removed, but the establishment of a strict Quality&#13;
Assurance (QA) regime can do much to ensure that clearing is carried out to the highest practical&#13;
standards. It also maintains pressure on the clearers to work to high standards. QA should be built&#13;
into every mine clearing program. It usually takes place at three levels; before the work begins, the&#13;
QA authority studies the clearing proposals put forward by the clearing organization, and looks at&#13;
their Standing Operational Procedures (SOPs) and safety regulations. If these are inadequate, they&#13;
either have to be corrected, or the contractor is not selected. At the second level, QA is carried out&#13;
at the work site to ensure that the organization is carrying out its operating procedures properly&#13;
and thoroughly. This involves watching the progress of the clearing, and the actions of the clearing&#13;
management staff. At the third level, samples of the cleared areas are re-inspected. If any mines or&#13;
munitions are found, the area will be declared insufficiently cleared, and the clearing done again at&#13;
the contractor's expense. Should many mines be found, the contract may be terminated due to the&#13;
contractor's poor workmanship. The QA requirements have to be built into the contract, and&#13;
agreed with the contractor before the contract is signed. The QA has to be done by a totally&#13;
independent agency. A contractor can be used, provided that this contractor has no other&#13;
contractual commitments in the country.&#13;

LESSONS FROM MINE CLEARING PROGRAMS&#13;
I      Large scale civilian mine clearing is comparatively new. Clearing after World War II was&#13;
done sporadically in several countries, often by soldiers. The end of the cold war allowed the world&#13;
to look at the mine contamination conditions in Afghanistan, Cambodia, and several countries in&#13;
Africa and Latin America, and to establish civilian programs to deal with them. The first major&#13;
program was set up by the United Nations in Afghanistan, where mine clearing started in early&#13;
1990 The clean-up after the Gulf War in 1991 and 1992 brought major civilian contractors into&#13;
the mine clearing business, and many lessons were leamt during this period. These have been&#13;
confirmed or modified as a result of other programs in Mozambique, Somalia. Rwanda. El&#13;
Salvador and Angola. Although the mine problems and their solutions have been unique to each&#13;
country, the fundamental principles remain the same.&#13;
2.     Mine Clearing by Soldiers. It is tempting to assume that, because soldiers lay mines&#13;
easily, they should be able to remove them with equal facility. The lessons of the past indicate that&#13;
unfortunatelv this is not the case. Removing mines requires a different order of discipline, training&#13;
and equipment to carry out large-scale humanitarian mine clearing, which is (or should be) more&#13;
like an industrial process than its military counterpart, minefield breaching. Soldiers tend to hurry&#13;
the mine clearing process. which usually results in casualties. Soldiers can be trained in civilian&#13;
mine clearing methods, and regiments of Bangladeshi, Egyptian, and Pakistani soldiers wvere&#13;
trained in Kuwait. It has been found that ex-soldiers, who have chosen to make their living clearing&#13;
mines are often more mature. and make better mine clearers.&#13;
3.     Mechanical Mine Clearing. Every mine clearing program has searched for a mechanical&#13;
solution to the mine clearing problem, the circumstances in Kuwait should have been ideal for such&#13;
a solution. In fact, the lessons of Kuwait, and other programs, have shown that hand clearing is&#13;
still the only trulv thorough method of mine clearing. There is no shortage of ideas for new&#13;
techniques and technologies, but most of these fail to take fully into account the destructive energy&#13;
of an anti-tank mine. They also tend to assume that mines always work according to their design&#13;
parameters. Mines, however, become unreliable and unpredictable, which increase their danger,&#13;
and the difficulty of finding a safe and reliable method of clearing them.&#13;
4.     Management and Administration. The lesson that has been repeated in almost all&#13;
programs is that a capability in mine clearing alone is insufficient. The mine clearing capability has&#13;
to be backed by capable and experienced managed and sound administration. Many small mine&#13;
companies ceased operations in Kuwait because or poor management and the resulting accidents. It&#13;
is difficult to eradicate all accidents, because, ultimately, during the clearing process, a mine&#13;
clearer has to deal directly with the mine, and many accidents are due to the human failings of&#13;
inattention, lapses of discipline, or lapses of memory.&#13;
5.     Support Systems. Another lesson of experience is the folly of rushing into a clearing&#13;
program, without proper attention to the medical, communications, casualty evacuation and&#13;
support systems that have to be in place before the first mine clearer steps into a minefield. These&#13;
preparations take time, but cannot be ignored or set aside in the interest of more rapid action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 8 page 2 of 2&#13;
6.     Enhancing Local Capacity. It is also essential to think in detail about how local capacitv&#13;
is to be created and supported. It has been found that setting up an organization to train mine&#13;
clearers is only part of the problem. More important is establishing the management organization&#13;
that will deploy them after training. In three major programs, more students were trained than&#13;
could be employed; manv drifted into other jobs, so their skills were lost. Others needed expensive&#13;
re-training before they could be employed in mine clearing. Setting up a mine clearing capacitv&#13;
therefore requires detailed planning and careful coordination of training and employment&#13;
opportunities. This, in turn, means identifying and scheduling mine clearing priorities and, at the&#13;
same time, securing adequate funding (including fitting cash flows to the priority schedule) from&#13;
donors, loans, and other sources.&#13;
7.     Risks and Public Perception. The lessons of the past six years have shown that until&#13;
successful new technologies for mine detection and clearing can be developed (which will require&#13;
substantial funding), mine clearing will continue to be a slow, dangerous, and expensive business.&#13;
Any mine clearing program faces the probability that there will be fatal or serious accidents, which&#13;
will spark criticism from those who are divorced from the problem. However, there is less likely to&#13;
be criticism from those whose lives are endangered by the mines, or whose access to utilities,&#13;
services, shelter, or employment is curtailed by mine contamination.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The primary objectives of the Emergency
            Transport and Mine Clearing Project are to: a) repair and
            reconstruct the surface transport networks within Croatia
            and between Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina; and b) clear
            landmines in areas of high economic priority for
            reconstruction. The project consists of two components. The
            transport component includes roads and bridges, railways,
            and Ploce port. The mine clearing component includes,
            initial screening, surveys, training, clearing of areas, and
            quality assurance.
