                          Chenery, Hollis B.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Robert Asher, on 1983-01-27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Hollis B. Chenery first served as Economic Adviser to President&#13;
McNamara from 1970 to 1972, then was personally chosen by him to serve&#13;
as Vice President for Development Policy. His pre-Bank experience was&#13;
a Marshall Plan economist in Europe, assistant administrator at USAID,&#13;
then professor of economics at Stanford and Harvard. He talks of first&#13;
meeting McNamara at Harvard during the latter's debriefing session&#13;
before taking over as President of the Bank, then at a conference in&#13;
Williamsburg to discuss the Pearson report. Chenery elaborates on&#13;
McNamara's interest in 'quantitative' economic research, and the&#13;
Bank's evolving focus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Chenery's efforts in adopting an overall Bank research program,&#13;
identifying outsiders working in the field, conducting "management&#13;
seminars", and internal discussions of individual countries&#13;
instrumental in sharpening analysis and, in some cases, changing Bank&#13;
policies as well as internal debates focusing on various sectors,&#13;
especially the design of agricultural projects. President McNamara's&#13;
and Monty [Montague] Yudelman's (brought in from the OECD as Director-&#13;
Agriculture Department) significant contributions. The results of the&#13;
Bank's research and the subsequent evaluation of loans made in this&#13;
area showing outstanding rates of return, thus illustrating the lack&#13;
of need to change the Bank's evaluation criteria in order to&#13;
accommodate a shift in emphasis in helping the rural poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Chenery discusses the program review and research functions of&#13;
his department, Development Policy, the functions of Mahbub ul Haq's&#13;
department, and Policy Planning and Program Review which brought&#13;
&amp;#12;together the research findings and applied them in country discussions&#13;
where research and policy judgments were subsequently extended to the&#13;
Research Committee and eventually produced as policy papers. He talks&#13;
of the joint Bank and ILO activity on the development of the 'basic&#13;
needs' concept and its effects on the Bank's development strategy, the&#13;
in-house task force he chaired on the Bank's poverty focus established&#13;
in '81 and its report. Recruiting economists, the advantages and&#13;
disadvantages of hiring prominent spokespersons from developing&#13;
countries, the desirability of a full spectrum of views and, in that&#13;
context, talks of hiring Mahbub ul Haq; known then as the Third World&#13;
spokesman in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Chenery then discusses building up research capacities within the&#13;
Bank, the early statement of objectives first published in '71 or '72,&#13;
and the recommendations of Sir Arthur Lewis, chairman of the main&#13;
advisory panel in his report published in '79. According to Chenery,&#13;
the Bank's best research is in the field of comparative studies, with&#13;
its diversified research portfolio where operational work research&#13;
tends to be micro-oriented and theoretical speculative research covers&#13;
macro-economics, and the Board's acceptance of the mix. The lack of&#13;
gaps between researchers and operators in the Bank due to the&#13;
existence of a strong mechanism in place rotating its staff, amply&#13;
illustrated by the composition of its senior staff. Chenery then&#13;
discusses the function of the Research Committee, the publication and&#13;
dissemination of research findings, and briefly talks about the&#13;
Pearson and Brandt commissions and the advantages of an outsider's&#13;
view.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Chenery discusses the origins and process involved in the&#13;
preparation and design of the World Development Report, beginning with&#13;
him initiating the Prospects paper on the occasion of the rise in oil&#13;
price in the fall of '73, Ernie Stern's invaluable contribution,&#13;
however, no longer as his deputy but as Vice President of Operations.&#13;
He credits McNamara for his "brilliant insight" into what the world&#13;
needed, addresses the merits of program versus project lending, the&#13;
&amp;#12;advantages of decentralizing economic work, and his contribution in&#13;
democratizing the selection process of his successor. He concludes&#13;
with a personal view on his years of service at the Bank, and opines&#13;
on the workings of the current Bank.&#13;
