LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower                People's Republic of Bangladesh&#13;
Project Outine    :    The Project will support the urgently needed provision of nonformal&#13;
education (NFE) to disadvantaged, illiterate young adults,&#13;
particularly females, and institutional development for NFE as part&#13;
of the country's poverty reduction and human development&#13;
strategy.&#13;
Classification          Primary                 :     Poverty reduction&#13;
Secondary               :    Women in development&#13;
Environmental Category       C&#13;
Rationale              In spite of the Government's policy toward the eradication of&#13;
illiteracy, a large number of adults remain uneducated. Without&#13;
specific actions to provide increased opportunities for a 'second&#13;
chance,0 there will be about 20 million illiterates in the age group&#13;
15-24 by the year 2000. The low level of literacy and life skills is a&#13;
major contributing factor to the perpetuation of poverty. There is&#13;
therefore an urgent need to increase opportunities for illiterates to&#13;
obtain NFE. The Project has been formulated within the Bank's&#13;
overall strategic objectives of poverty reduction and improving the&#13;
status of women, and the Govemment's development framework&#13;
to attain the national Education for All (EFA) targets. The Project&#13;
w4ill complement the Bank's previous investment in primary&#13;
education in Bangladesh by ensuring that the educationally most&#13;
disadvantaged segment of the population, particularly females, will&#13;
have an opportunity to gain literacy and life skills to improve their&#13;
socioeconomic situation.&#13;
Objective and&#13;
Scope             :    The Project will assist the Government in achieving EFA by&#13;
improving and expanding NFE to reach illiterate young adults,&#13;
particularly females. Specifically, the Project will strengthen NFE by&#13;
(i) assisting in the institutionalization of the Integrated Nonformal&#13;
Education Program into a Directorate of NFE (DNFE) staffed by&#13;
qualified personnel able to function In related tasks such as&#13;
planning, training, monitoring, and evaluation; and (ii) expanding&#13;
and improving NFE programs to reach an estimated 2.5 million&#13;
learners of the targeted age group through nongovernmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs) and the local district administration. The&#13;
Project will form part of the Govemment's overall NFE development&#13;
program to be supported by different extemal agencies.&#13;
Cost Estimates          The total cost of the Project is estimated at $51.0 million&#13;
equivalent, including taxes, duties, and contingencies, of which an&#13;
estimated $4.3 million, or 8 percent, is foreign exchange cost,&#13;
including $0.8 million of service charge on the proposed loan. The&#13;
local currency cost is estimated at $46.7 million equivalent, or 92&#13;

1. THE PROPOSAL&#13;
1.          I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a&#13;
proposed loan to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Nonformal Education Project.&#13;
II. INTRODUCTION&#13;
2.          In 1993, the Bank provided technical assistance (TA)' to prepare a project for&#13;
nonformal education (NFE) in Bangladesh. The Bank undertook loan fact-finding in November-&#13;
December 1994, and appraised the Project in April 19952 The Intemational Development&#13;
Association (IDA) and the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) are expected to cofinance the&#13;
Project. Close consultations and coordination with officials of the Government, other funding&#13;
agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and expected beneficiaries have been&#13;
ensured throughout the process. This report is based on the TA report, the Fact-finding and&#13;
Appraisal Missions, and the work of Government officials.&#13;
III. BACKGROUND&#13;
A.    Subsector Description&#13;
3.          Unlike many developing countries, Bangladesh has a largely homogeneous&#13;
society with a common cultural and linguistic identity. The fact that Bangla is spoken throughout&#13;
the country is particularly advantageous in the spread of literacy and basic education. A large,&#13;
diverse, and dynamic community of NGOs are engaged in economic and social development;&#13;
nonetheless, Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita income&#13;
of about $220. The proportion of hard-core poverty (consumption of less than 1,805 calories per&#13;
day) fell from 30.7 percent in mid-1970 to 24.9 percent in the 1980s, but the absolute number&#13;
of persons in hard-core poverty has risen because of the increase in population and is now&#13;
estimated at 30 million. A key factor contributing to poverty in Bangladesh is the smallness of&#13;
the literate population base, especially among women, which poses a serious constraint to&#13;
Government efforts to curb the population growth rate and increase labor productivity and&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
4.          Females are particularly disadvantaged. Contrary to the situation in most of the&#13;
world, the life expectancy for women in Bangladesh is lower than that for men. The mortality rate&#13;
for girls (aged 1-4) is 21 percent higher than that for boys. The tradition of early marriage&#13;
adversely effects women's status and welfare and has a negative impact on women's access to&#13;
education and on their health, as girls begin bearing children at a very young age. Girls have&#13;
had less access to basic education opportunities and have dropped out faster than boys,&#13;
resulting in the present low literacy rate for females, 23 percent, compared with 44 percent for&#13;
males.&#13;
I     TA No. 2013-BAN: Nonformal Education Project, for $250,000, approved on 14 December 1993.&#13;
2     The Mission comprised G. Forsberg (Education Specialist, Mission Leader); J. Boyd (Senior Counsel, OGC);&#13;
W. Costin (Project Specialist, AWEH); N. Huda (Project Officer, BRM); Y. Uehara (Social Sect6rs Specialist,&#13;
PW2); A. Aarons (Task Manager, IDA); F. Munger (Staff Consultant, AWEH): and R. Schoch (Consultant,&#13;
SDC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
5.           Past low investments in primary education have been one of the major reasons&#13;
for limited access to basic schooling for the majority of the rural population, especially women.&#13;
In the last two decades, Bangladesh has adopted various efforts to define and address the&#13;
quantitative and qualitative gaps that have kept universal primary education a distant goal. These&#13;
initiatives include commitment to Basic Education for All (EFA)' by the year 2000, the General&#13;
Education Project (GEP)2, compulsory primary education (CPE), and an Integrated Nonformal&#13;
Education Program. To further emphasize the importance of basic education, primary and mass&#13;
education were separated from the Ministry of Education to form a Primary and Mass Education&#13;
Division (PMED) in 1992. PMED is headed by a Secretary who reports directly to the Prime&#13;
Minister. The Govemment has also put increased emphasis on the role of NFE to complement&#13;
universal primary education.&#13;
1.    Nonformal Education&#13;
6.           In the Bangladesh context, NFE is defined as intentional, purposive instruction that&#13;
(i) occurs outside the formal Government school system, and (ii) incorporates flexibilities in the&#13;
organization and management of the program and the curriculum. Currently, most NFE in&#13;
Bangladesh is provided through NGOs or other voluntary organizations either in programs&#13;
focusing on NFE only or within broader development projects. It is estimated that in 1994, about&#13;
1.7 million learners, aged 6-14 years, and 0.6 million adults were receiving some form of NFE&#13;
conducted by NGOs and other voluntary organizations in addition to a few Government&#13;
institutions and other line ministries. The program categories generally fall into the following&#13;
groups: early childhood education (4-5 years), nonformal primary education (6-10 years),&#13;
nonformal education for older children (11-14 years), adult literacy, continuing education, and&#13;
integrated literacy programs with income generation and agriculture extension. Experience so&#13;
far indicates low dropout rates and high attendance and completion rates. Dropout rates are&#13;
generally below 10 percent and around 3 percent for the primary education programs. These&#13;
factors are attributed to the flexible NFE structure, relevant program content, and the close&#13;
supervision of centers. Adult dropout rates tend to be higher according to a 1992 survey of NGO&#13;
programs-around 20 percent for males and 9 percent for females.&#13;
7.           To implement the Government's EFA program, an Integrated Nonformal Education&#13;
Program (INFEP) was started in 1992 with funding from the Government, UNICEF, and UNDP.&#13;
INFEP is a project under PMED, designed to pilot a comprehensive NFE system that will&#13;
complement the formal system. A major component of this project is education equivalent to&#13;
formal grades I and 11 to children who never enter or who drop out of the formal system. Other&#13;
components are preprimary education for ages four to five, programs for older children aged 11-&#13;
14, adult education with a focus on the 15-35 age group, and continuing education. INFEP is&#13;
Basic education for all includes early childhood education, primary education for children, literacy and life&#13;
skills for youth and adults; it may extend to secondary education in some countries.&#13;
2     GEP, a $310 million project, was initiated in 1992 and aims to increase access to and improve the quality&#13;
and management of primary education; it has also a small NFE component. The cofinanciers are the&#13;
International Development Association (IDA), the Bank (Loan No. 1026-BAN[SF]), Directorate General for&#13;
Development Cooperation of the Netherlands (DGIS), Swedish International Development Cooperation&#13;
Agency (SIDA), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),&#13;
United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), and Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation&#13;
(NORAD).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
also supporting a Total Literacy Movement (TLM) pilot program. TLM is a campaign and&#13;
volunteer-based approach. TLM provides a six-month literacy and three-month postliteracy&#13;
program to illiterate learners aged 11-45 and is implemented through district-level committees&#13;
including Government development agencies, the private sector, local elites, voluntary&#13;
associations, and the community. This mass mobilization of all sections of society is the driving&#13;
force for the approach.&#13;
8.         INFEP has designed a curriculum development process and curriculum outlines.&#13;
Textbooks and teachers' manuals have been developed and produced for the preprimary,&#13;
children's, and adults' programs. In addition to literacy and numeracy, the materials cover life&#13;
skills such as health, nutrition, hygiene, family planning, civic rghts, and income generation. A&#13;
distribution system for materials has also been established. Preservice training and ongoing in-&#13;
service training for teachers are in place. The NFE programs are delivered by INFEP itself and&#13;
by NGOs that receive support from INFEP for teacher and supervisor honoraria, training, and&#13;
materials. District coordinators and supervisors monitor the NFE programs. In 1995, INFEP and&#13;
NGOs were running about 25,000 NFE centers in 64 out of 460 thanas,' with a total of about&#13;
750,000 learners. Over 120 NGOs are involved in the INFEP program. In addition, TLM is being&#13;
tried out in about 8,000 centers in one district, covering about 200,000 learners.&#13;
2.    NGOs in Nonformal Education&#13;
9.          Compared with their counterparts in many other developing countries, NGOs in&#13;
Bangladesh are far more numerous (an estimated 13,000), faced with the task of tackling&#13;
enormous poverty, supported by foreign funds, prepared to expand the size of their operations,&#13;
and have distinguished themselves through their innovative capacity. Most NGO development&#13;
work in Bangladesh is based on building solidarity among the poor through group formation,&#13;
consciousness-raising, savings and income generation. Women represent the most exploited&#13;
section of the population and have therefore been given priority in NGO programs.&#13;
10.         Most NGOs see NFE as an essential component of poverty reduction programs.&#13;
The EFA campaign adopted by the Government has been strongly supported by NGOs and has&#13;
stimulated initiatives in a number of areas, including the formation among NGOs of the&#13;
Campaign for Popular Education (CAMPE), a resource organization for basic and adult&#13;
education. A CAMPE survey (1993) identified 186 NGOs as having at least two years of&#13;
experience in literacy programs, and another 140 had conducted some previous programs.&#13;
Some NGOs have developed their own NFE materials and training, while others use formal&#13;
primary education materials or materials developed by INFEP. The effectiveness of the major&#13;
NGOs has been evaluated by bilateral and multilateral organizations. At their best, NGO&#13;
programs have had real and direct relevance to the needs and aspirations of the learners,&#13;
demonstrated by classes with high attendance and low dropout rates. This has been achieved&#13;
through the development of needs-based curriculum, participatory teaching methodologies, and&#13;
materials that start with the experiences of the learners and the communities where they live.&#13;
NGOs' expertise has been shared with INFEP in the development of curricula, materials, and&#13;
training programs.&#13;
The administrative level below the district.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
11.         NGOs' potential sources of funds are (i) the community, (ii) their own income-&#13;
generating activities, (iii) aid agency funds channeled through the Government, and (iv) direct&#13;
aid agency funds. Because NGOs have generally found it difficult to raise funds from the&#13;
communities where NFE centers are established, they have instead asked them to provide&#13;
accommodations for the classes and simple items such as mats. These provisions also serve&#13;
as an expression of community demand and commitment. Some larger NGOs have income-&#13;
generating capacity from marketing and revolving fund activities, which can be used for&#13;
education purposes. For example, over 40 percent of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement&#13;
Committee (BRAC) revenue comes from internally generated funds. It is estimated that NGOs&#13;
receiving INFEP support contribute about 10 to 15 percent to NFE delivery themselves. Because&#13;
of their effectiveness and innovation, NGOs have received increasing levels of overseas grant&#13;
funding.&#13;
3.    Key Issues in Nonformal Education&#13;
12.         Since 1992, INFEP has rapidly expanded NFE programs. The development of the&#13;
range of programs now being implemented-early childhood, basic, adolescent, and adult&#13;
NFE-has demanded a major commitment of expertise over a relatively short period. Its present&#13;
organizational structure, staff, professional expertise and resources are, however, inadequate to&#13;
deliver large-scale, quality NFE programs. Another issue is the need to shift the priorities of the&#13;
NFE target groups. Presently the major focus of NFE provision is on out-of-school children;&#13;
however, a declining primary school age group coupled with introduction of CPE requires a&#13;
gradual shift in focus from children to young adults.&#13;
a.    Institutional Capacity of INFEP&#13;
13.         The present INFEP consists of 46 professional and 78 support staff located in&#13;
Dhaka. In addition there are 64 professional and 128 support staff located in 64 district offices.&#13;
None of the professional staff responsible for technical support to NFE had any previous&#13;
experience with NFE before joining INFEP and because of its temporary project structure, INFEP&#13;
has had difficulty in recruiting qualified staff. To implement a larger-scale and multiagency-&#13;
assisted NFE program, a strengthened permanent NFE structure is needed, to be organized on&#13;
a functional basis and with clear terms of reference. Additional staff are also needed, particularly&#13;
in the areas of administration and monitoring and evaluation to ensure accountability of NGOs&#13;
and efficiency of programs.&#13;
14.         INFEP lacks experienced specialists in NFE in the areas of curriculum and&#13;
materials development and training and has therefore relied on experienced NGOs for assistance&#13;
in program development. With only a very small group of on-the-job trained specialists to&#13;
develop and implement a major curriculum and materials development project as well as to carry&#13;
out mass-scale training of NFE supervisors and teachers, the quality of NFE programs has&#13;
suffered. There is also a shortage of expertise for monitoring and evaluation and for support to&#13;
supervisors and district coordinators to improve the quality of supervision and teaching at NFE&#13;
centers and develop measures to assess learning achievement. A permanent organization will&#13;
need research capacity to test ideas, options, materials, methods, and appropriate patterns for&#13;
NFE delivery to provide the basis for continuous improvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
b.    Quality of Programs and System Monitoring&#13;
15.         While there are examples of good teaching at NFE centers, there are also many&#13;
examples showing that teachers' training has been ineffective or inadequate. Adult literacy&#13;
classes present particular problems because of a very wide range of ages among learners,&#13;
learning problems outside the experience of the often young teachers, and the motivation of tired&#13;
people at the end of the day. Evaluation and review of the present training methodologies,&#13;
curriculum, and materials, and development of postliteracy materials after the initial two years&#13;
of implementation are essential. Furthermore, since the training lasts for only about 20 days,&#13;
close supervision and support of teachers are crucial. Currently, most supervisors are young&#13;
male graduates, often in their first employment, lacking prior training and experience in teaching&#13;
in general and NFE in particular. The design and nature of the training they receive need revision&#13;
and improvement. Research and development are also needed to provide the necessary&#13;
foundations for an efficient NFE system, especially research applied to the practical problems&#13;
of preparing good materials and teaching methodologies.&#13;
16.         Related to the need to strengthen institutional capacity is the need for an effective&#13;
NFE monitoring system, including a data base, to meet the issue of accountability for NFE.&#13;
Overall data regarding current and previous providers of NFE are not available. The&#13;
establishment of an effective information system will be crucial to planning and monitoring a&#13;
larger national NFE program. Basic information on NFE centers, teachers, students, repeaters,&#13;
dropouts, and achievement is needed to be fed into a central management information system.&#13;
There is a lack of a reliable system for assessment of learning achievement. Core competencies&#13;
have not been identified and measurement of learning outcomes is left to the subjective&#13;
judgment of the teachers. Systems monitoring also involves accountability, particularly (i) the&#13;
extent to which the system is delivering education as defined by the learning outcomes, and (ii)&#13;
financial accountability of those receiving funding for NFE. The effectiveness of NFE monitoring&#13;
for such accountability needs strengthening. More effective procedures within INFEP to cope with&#13;
the increasing number of NGOs are essential. Independent monitoring procedures that provide&#13;
a continuing, separate, and random check on NGO and learner performance are also necessary.&#13;
C.    Target Groups&#13;
17.         In spite of earlier attempts to reduce adult illiteracy since the early 1970s, the&#13;
literacy rate has increased only from 26 percent to 35 percent during the period 1974-1991. On&#13;
the basis of the current population and literacy rates, and the assumption of an efficient primary&#13;
school system, an estimated 6 million children (8-14 years) and 20 million adult learners (15-24&#13;
years) will require education outside the formal system by the year 2000. To meet the EFA goals,&#13;
the Government's modified planning targets for NFE programs are (i) 0.64 million children (8-10&#13;
years),' (ii) 2 million adolescents (11-14 years), and (iii) 20.8 million adults. In 1994, about 1.7&#13;
million 6-14 year-old children and 0.6 million adults were provided education by NFE programs.&#13;
With current NFE resources (about 4.3 percent of the total education development budget), it&#13;
will take decades to reach the anticipated EFA target of 23 million, even if NFE institutional&#13;
capacity is enhanced. Therefore, increased resources need to be immediately directed at NFE&#13;
Through the implementation of compulsory primary education, PMED anticipates that all 6- and 7-year-olds&#13;
will be enrolled in primary schools and dropouts will start only at the age of 8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
program delivery. These resources, however, need to be phased to match institutional capability&#13;
and to ensure the quality of the programs.&#13;
18.         Currently, NFE implemented through NGOs is geared towards the 6-1 0 and 11-14&#13;
age groups to ensure that most children will obtain basic education and not add to the vast&#13;
number of adult illiterates. The 6-10 age group is, however, declining, and the Government&#13;
intends to provide formal schooling for 95 percent of the 6-10 age group and reduce the dropout&#13;
rate to 30 percent by the year 2000. The existing level of NFE provision may therefore already&#13;
be adequate for the younger children over the next five years, provided the formal system&#13;
achieves its targets. Some support will still be needed for the 8-10 and 11 -14 age groups, since&#13;
a small percentage will still not enrol and at least 30 percent will be dropouts even in the year&#13;
2000. Therefore, a shift of priorities from children toward the illiterate young adults, aged 15-24,&#13;
will be necessary for the period 1996-2000. Currently, about 10 million are illiterate in this age&#13;
group. NFE for the 15-24 age group is economically and socially more justifiable than for older&#13;
learners since they will at this stage start a family and take up work, they are keener to attend&#13;
classes than older age groups, they have fewer children and therefore more time, and for them&#13;
no provision other than NFE will be available. Within the 15-24 age group, there should be a&#13;
focus on females since about 77 percent of the women are illiterate in Bangladesh.&#13;
Intergenerational effects (i.e. literate mothers will send their children to school), health and family&#13;
planning, and labor productivity through access to training and employment are also likely to be&#13;
optimized for this group.&#13;
B.   Government Policies and Plans&#13;
19.         The major objectives of the Government's Perspective Plan (1995-2010) are&#13;
poverty reduction, human development and women's participation in development. The&#13;
strategies include expansion and improvement of basic education, continuation of CPE, and&#13;
support for a gender sensitive educational system. In 1992, a Task Force on Primary and Mass&#13;
Education was set up with high-level representatives from the different ministries and&#13;
departments and NGOs to recommend policies and strategies for primary and mass education&#13;
and finalize a National Plan of Action (NPA) for EFA by the year 2000. The NPA set out four&#13;
specific objectives: (i) raise the gross enrollment ratio in the primary school from 76 percent to&#13;
95 percent, (ii) raise the female gross enrollment ratio from 70 percent to 94 percent, (iii) reduce&#13;
the dropout rate at the primary level from 60 percent to 30 percent, and (iv) raise the adult&#13;
literacy rate from 35 percent to 62 percent. In addition, it recommended the establishment of a&#13;
Directorate of NFE (DNFE) and close cooperation with NGOs. These objectives were&#13;
subsequently included in the Perspective Plan.&#13;
20.         To reach the illiterate population who are outside the school system, NFE has&#13;
been identified as an important means toward fulfilling the national targets. With the Government&#13;
priority on NFE, the responsibilities of INFEP have become increasingly more important. This led&#13;
to a proposal to reorganize INFEP into DNFE in 1995. Upgrading INFEP to a DNFE will (i)&#13;
provide higher level status to the NFE subsector; (ii) allow DNFE as a Government organization&#13;
to recommend policy, strategies, and programs for NFE; (iii) allow the organization to be funded&#13;
from the revenue budget, rather than from the development budget; and (iv) provide permanent&#13;
status and job security to staff who presently are reluctant to pursue a specialist career in NFE.&#13;
The NPA for EFA also stressed the importance of the partnership between Government and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
NGOs for provision of NFE.' It is recognized that NGOs can play a key role in the delivery of&#13;
NFE to the disadvantaged population by their ability to (i) Identify, mobilize, and involve&#13;
beneficiaries, particularly in social preparation and community organization; (Ii) establish effective&#13;
working relations with the poor; (iii) stimulate a sense of self-reliance and democracy; (iv) provide&#13;
a decentralized management system; (v) share methodology and materials, In particular inputs&#13;
to postliteracy and continuing education prograrns and materials; and (vi) develop innovative&#13;
programs.&#13;
21.         The Govemment's increasing priority to education is illustrated by a growing share&#13;
of revenue and development expenditure. Public expenditure as a proportion of the gross&#13;
domestic product has increased from 1.5 percent in the mid-1980s to 3.0 percent in 1994, but&#13;
is still below the Asian average of 3.3 percent. In the late 1980s, public spending on education&#13;
was low and remained at around 13 percent of the total revenue expenditure and 5 percent of&#13;
the total development expenditure. With higher priority attached to education in the last few&#13;
years, these proportions have increased since 1992 to around 17 percent and 14 percent,&#13;
respectively. NFE is currently funded under the development budget. The development share&#13;
for NFE is low, accounting for only 4.3 percent of the total education development budget for&#13;
FY1 995/96. The Government allocations to NFE have, however, increased by over 100 percent&#13;
during the last three fiscal years.&#13;
C.   External Assistance to the Subsector&#13;
22.         External assistance to NFE is currently channeled through the Govemment to&#13;
INFEP or directly to NGOs. The assistance to INFEP has so far been small. About $20 million&#13;
has been provided since 1992, which is about 10 percent of the extemal assistance directed at&#13;
primary education through GEP. The low level of extemal NFE funding to the Government is&#13;
partly a result of INFEP's project nature and limited institutional capacity. The largest source of&#13;
funding for INFEP has been UNICEF. Assistance has also been provided by SIDA, UNDP, and&#13;
NORAD. In addition, DGIS and SIDA have provided funds for NFE under GEP (Appendix 1). The&#13;
largest proportion of funding has been for program delivery to the 6-10 and 11 -14 age groups,&#13;
delivered through NGOs, as well as for development of curriculum, materials, and training&#13;
programs. Bilateral and other international organizations also provide support directly to NGOs.&#13;
The extent of this assistance is difficult to quantify because of the large number of agencies&#13;
involved and difficulty in obtaining data that separate direct funding to NGOs from funding&#13;
provided through various Government projects.&#13;
D.   Lessons Learned&#13;
23.         The Bank has assisted the Government in the education sector since 1978. During&#13;
the first ten years, the Bank assisted with three loans In educational equipment development,&#13;
secondary science, and NFE to increase the quality of and access to education. The Community&#13;
Schools Project (CSP),2 which was completed in 1988, was the Bank's first project in NFE and&#13;
The Bank is currently providing technical assistance to strengthen Government and NGO cooperation&#13;
through TA No. 2088-BAN: Insttutonia Strengthening for Government-NGO Cooperaton, for $325,000,&#13;
approved on 27 April 1994.&#13;
2     Loan No. 510-BAN(SF): Community Schools Project, for $13.5 million, approved on 21 April 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
provided low-cost skills training for the rural population in about 400 schools. Since 1990, the&#13;
Bank has provided six loans: Primary Education Sector, Rural Training, Higher Secondary,&#13;
Rehabilitation of Damaged Schools Facilities, Bangladesh Open University (BOU), and&#13;
Secondary Education Development Projects. The BOU Project, using a distance education&#13;
approach, will complement the capacity of existing primary, secondary, higher, and nonformal&#13;
education. BOU will complement DNFE training of trainers and preparation of instructional&#13;
materials.&#13;
24.         The Project Completion Report (1989) and Project Performance Audit Report&#13;
(1990) for CSP, which was most closely related to the proposed Project, noted that the project&#13;
had limited success in promoting NFE and in providing the rural poor with employable skills. The&#13;
limited success was attributed to implementation failure rather than to lack of interest among the&#13;
potential beneficiaries. For example, the appointment of consultants took place two years after&#13;
the commencement of the project, which had a negative effect on the design of training and&#13;
course curricula. The Project Implementation Unit lacked staff and there was a frequent change&#13;
of project directors. Another important reason was that the institutional mechanism necessary&#13;
for effective management and administration was not established. Other limitations were that the&#13;
approach had not previously been tested in Bangladesh and community links were absent. The&#13;
rationale and design for the Project draws on this past Bank experience by supporting a&#13;
permanent institutional structure from the start and by building on NFE with close NGO and&#13;
community involvement.&#13;
25.         The development of the Project has also taken into account the NFE experience&#13;
under GEP. The experience has indicated the need for (i) efficient and flexible administrative&#13;
procedures and operating structures; (ii) effective monitoring of the processes of NFE provision;&#13;
and (iii) maximization of the diverse contributions of NGOs, both large and small. In addition, the&#13;
Project has drawn on the extensive experience of NGOs conducting NFE in Bangladesh. This&#13;
has indicated the need for (i) the establishment of grass-roots needs and involvement; (ii)&#13;
supervision as the most important factor of performance success; and (iii) continuing review and&#13;
upgrading of methodologies and materials, based on emerging experience and evaluation. To&#13;
address these issues, the Project is designed to support DNFE with upgraded expertise and&#13;
flexibility in terms of organization of programs, NGOs as main implementors, and strengthened&#13;
monitoring and evaluation capacity.&#13;
E.   The Bank's Sectoral Strategy&#13;
26.         The Bank's education policy, articulated in Education andDevelopmentin Asia and&#13;
the Pacific (1991), has identified NFE as a subsectoral priority to reduce illiteracy and&#13;
complement the formal education system where the latter is not capable of meeting the demand&#13;
for education, particularly of women and disadvantaged groups. The Bank's recent Education&#13;
Sector Assistance Strategy 1995-2000 for Bangladesh (March 1995) reiterates the need for&#13;
complementary NFE as a prerequisite for poverty reduction. Another priority area for the Bank&#13;
is the strengthening of the institutional capabilities of sector organizations, including their&#13;
planning and management capability. The Bank's operational strategy in Bangladesh (1993)&#13;
emphasizes the need to increase the capacity of human resources, as part of the overall poverty&#13;
reduction focus, through provision of primary education and mass literacy and adult education,&#13;
particularly to the disadvantaged groups in rural areas. The Project will directly address the&#13;
Bank's strategic objectives of poverty reduction and improvement of the status of women as well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
as subsectoral and country priorities by providing NFE programs, especially designed to meet&#13;
the needs and interests of women. The programs will enable participants to take advantage of&#13;
income generation opportunities, social services, and self-improvement activities. The Project will&#13;
also strengthen NFE institutional capacity, which will have long-term implications for the country's&#13;
ability to promote national development processes. At all levels of Project design, there has been&#13;
a strong emphasis on a participatory approach through involvement of NGOs and consultation&#13;
with beneficiaries.&#13;
F.    Policy Dialogue&#13;
27.         Overall policies, strategies, and targets for primary education and NFE have been&#13;
articulated in the Perspective Plan, the Task Force on Primary and Mass Education, and the NPA&#13;
for EFA. The Bank has had extensive consultations with the Govemment and other external&#13;
agencies to ensure a program approach rather than a project approach to NFE. This dialogue&#13;
needs to be formalized and finalized in a detailed, costed plan for the period 1996-2000. The&#13;
Government is currently preparing such a plan for primary and nonformal education, as&#13;
preparation for a follow-up project to GEP.&#13;
28.        In the context of the Government's plan to establish DNFE, the thrust of the&#13;
discussions with the Government has been on defining the role and staffing of such an institution&#13;
and future sustainability. For long-terrn NFE development there is a need for a central permanent&#13;
body to plan and coordinate a larger program. The present INFEP constitutes the core on which&#13;
DNFE will be built. Central staff will, however, have to be kept at a minimum level, and the skills&#13;
of staff in district offices strengthened. DNFE's role will be to plan, coordinate, provide technical&#13;
support, monitor, and evaluate programs while mobilization, setting of strategies, and&#13;
implementation will be undertaken by NGOs, other voluntary organizations, the field&#13;
administration, or community groups. The establishment of DNFE will be an important step for&#13;
ensuring the sustainability of NFE.&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   Rationale&#13;
29.        In spite of the Government's policy toward eradication of illiteracy, a large number&#13;
of children, adolescents, and adults remain uneducated in Bangladesh. Researchers have&#13;
estimated that an 80 percent literacy rate and near-universal primary school enrollment are&#13;
necessary conditions for sustainable economic development. Without specific actions to provide&#13;
increased opportunities for "second chance" education in Bangladesh, illiterates aged 15-24 are&#13;
estimated to number about 20 million by the year 2000. Lack of literacy and life skills are major&#13;
contributing factors to the perpetuation of poverty. The Bank's Project will assist in supporting&#13;
the Government's objective of EFA by the year 2000, and the Bank's strategic objectives of&#13;
poverty reduction and improvement of the status of women.&#13;
30.         The Project will support the development of a permanent NFE organization which&#13;
will enable the Government to expand and improve NFE programs in the medium and long term&#13;
as well as ensure sustainability of NFE activities. Considerable capacity and experience of NFE&#13;
exist within NGOs, therefore, NGOs will be the main implementors of NFE under the Project. The&#13;
target groups for NFE delivery will be young adults, particularly females, the segment of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
illiterate population which is presently the most underserved, in districts with low literacy rates.&#13;
INFEP has during the last two years demonstrated considerable achievements in its complex and&#13;
diverse programs, particularly in terms of program development. The Project will build upon this&#13;
experience and develop it further. The Bank's ongoing BOU project will provide complementary&#13;
support to the proposed Project through its NFE courses.&#13;
31.         The current social context is judged favorable for NFE as manifested by the&#13;
increase of Government's own financing to NFE, from 0.3 percent in FY 1991/92 to 2.0 percent&#13;
in FY 1995/96. The experience of existing NFE provision also indicates a high demand for such&#13;
programs. Attendance and completion rates for NFE programs are high, particularly for out-of-&#13;
school children. Traditional gender discrimination against girls has resulted in past low enrolment&#13;
in formal schools, therefore, NFE provision has given priority to females and it is estimated that&#13;
about 70 percent of the learners are females. Retention rates are also higher for females than&#13;
for males in adult classes.&#13;
B.   Objectives and Scope&#13;
32.         The Project will assist the Government in achieving EFA by improving and&#13;
expanding NFE to reach illiterate young adults (15-24 years), particularly females. Specifically,&#13;
the Project will strengthen NFE by (i) institutionalizing INFEP into DNFE staffed by qualified&#13;
personnel able to function in related tasks such as planning, training, monitoring, and evaluation;&#13;
and (ii) expanding and improving NFE programs to reach, through NGOs and through the local&#13;
district administration, an estimated 2.5 million adult learners of which at least 1.3 million are&#13;
expected to be women.&#13;
33.         To strengthen institutional capacity for NFE, the Project will (i) assist in setting up&#13;
a National Council for Primary and Mass Education, which will act as a senior-level advisory&#13;
forum for both primary education and NFE; (ii) establish DNFE; and (iii) provide staff&#13;
development at DNFE. To support expansion and improvement of the NFE program for adults,&#13;
the Project will support (i) NFE delivery to young adults, (ii) quality improvement, and (iii)&#13;
alternative NFE models and social mobilization activities.&#13;
1.   Institutional Development&#13;
a.    Establishment of a National Council for Primary and Mass Education&#13;
34.         NFE programs presently include a large number of children who may, after two&#13;
years of NFE, continue in primary schools. To maintain close coordination between NFE and the&#13;
formal system, the Government's Task Force on Primary and Mass Education recommended that&#13;
a National Council for Primary and Mass Education be set up to act as a senior-level policy,&#13;
planning, mobilization, and coordinating authority for primary education and NFE. The Council&#13;
will be set up under the Project as a support structure to DNFE at the national level. The Council&#13;
will include members from the Government, private providers, and NGOs. The Council will serve&#13;
as adviser to the Government on policies for primary education and NFE, and provide guidance&#13;
regarding national goals and objectives and strategies for mobilization.&#13;
b.    Establishment of a Directorate of NFE&#13;
35.         The Prime Minister has approved the decision of the Executive Committee for the&#13;
National Economic Council to establish DNFE. The Project will strengthen the organization of&#13;
DNFE, and improve the management and professional expertise needed for the planned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
expansion of NFE. DNFE will build on the existing INFEP structure and be established along&#13;
functional lines. It will have four Units, each headed by a director: (i) Planning, Programming,&#13;
Monitoring, and Evaluation; (ii) Operations; (iii) Technical Support Service; and (iv) Finance and&#13;
Administration. The organization will absorb existing INFEP staff, strengthened by additional 11&#13;
professional staff at headquarters to enhance Project Implementation and overall institutional&#13;
capacity for the total NFE program between 1996-2000. The operational costs of DNFE will be&#13;
transferred to the revenue budget after Project completion. The detailed organization of DNFE&#13;
is in Appendix 2.&#13;
36.         To address the issues of program quality and the need for effective systems&#13;
monitoring, the Project will support the development of expertise in curriculum, program, and&#13;
materials development; program evaluation; training; action research; and evaluation through&#13;
external certificate courses. A long-term international consultant in planning, monitoring, and&#13;
evaluation for NFE will be provided as well as domestic consultants in statistical analysis,&#13;
financial systems, information analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and computer systems (see&#13;
Appendix 3). These services will assist in the development of approprate systems and expertise&#13;
for management of the expanded NFE delivery.&#13;
37.         The Project also includes the construction of a NFE headquarters building to&#13;
replace the current inadequate, rented accommodation to better service the needs of the central&#13;
NFE administration. The building will accommodate the Technical Support Service Unit (TSSU)&#13;
with library, research and development, materials production, and training facilities; a small&#13;
hostel as a base for the extensively planned training and development programs, particularly for&#13;
district-based master trainers and coordinators; and a warehouse for storage and distribution of&#13;
materials. The site for the headquarters' building has been acquired. The Project will support&#13;
rental of DNFE facilities until the completion of the headquarters building, district NFE offices,&#13;
and training premises where no other alternatives exist in the districts covered by the Project.&#13;
Service vehicles will be provided for district coordinators under the Project.&#13;
c.    Staff Development&#13;
38.         The Project will enhance DNFE staff capacity to plan, manage, monitor, and&#13;
evaluate program expansion; and support program development and quality instruction. For this&#13;
purpose, the Project will provide international and domestic consulting services (see Appendix&#13;
3), local training, local and external fellowships, and regional study tours (see Appendix 4).&#13;
39.         Local training will provide general and specialist upgrading in NFE to headquarters&#13;
staff and district coordinators. Supervisor and teacher training for NFE as part of NFE delivery&#13;
will also be supported. This training will be delivered by master trainers who will train supervisors&#13;
who in turn will train teachers. The development of training programs, training of master trainers,&#13;
and supervision of the training programs will be the responsibility of a group of core trainers&#13;
provided under the Project and located within TSSU. The core trainers will be assisted by an&#13;
international consultant provided under the Project. Training system development under the&#13;
Project will provide the professional infrastructure for all teacher training under DNFE.&#13;
40.         The local fellowships will support specialist training for DNFE personnel in the&#13;
following key areas: finance and systems development, management and supervision, and basic&#13;
and advanced computer skills. Provision has also been made for regional study tours for central&#13;
and local key officials and DNFE staff, to provide an overview of alternative NFE organization and&#13;
practice, and Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (BME) systems in other countries in the region.&#13;
The Project will finance long-term extemal fellowship training for six senior staff of TSSU in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
management and development of NFE, design, planning, and evaluation of training programs;&#13;
teaching methodology; curriculum development and materials production; and research&#13;
methodology.&#13;
41.         Long-term international consulting services will be provided to TSSU in NFE&#13;
teacher training and methodology. Provision has also been made for the employment of&#13;
specialist local contract staff, including 20 core trainers, an audiovisual technician, 5-10&#13;
management trainers, and 10 assistant monitors (see Appendix 3). Funding for the development&#13;
of a specialist library has also been included.&#13;
2.    Expansion and Improvement of NFE&#13;
42.         To help toward achieving EFA, the Project includes (i) NFE delivery to young&#13;
adults (15-24 years), (ii) quality improvement, and (iii) alternative NFE models and social&#13;
mobilization. Project funds will be made available to DNFE for delivery of NFE programs through&#13;
NGOs fulfilling the selection criteria, and through the district administration.&#13;
a.    Delivery of NFE&#13;
43.         Young adults will be offered a nine-month NFE program, and a three-month&#13;
postliteracy program. The course will provide literacy, numeracy, and life skill subjects. Classes&#13;
will have a maximum of 30 learners identified by the community and will be scheduled at a time&#13;
most convenient to the participants, in accommodations provided by the community. At least 50&#13;
percent of the learners of all groups, or 1.3 million, will be females. The target for women is&#13;
expected to be achieved based on NGOs particular focus on mobilizing women, women's&#13;
present high enrollment and attendance rates in NFE classes, as well as specific NFE features&#13;
to attract women such as convenient location, timing of classes, and course content of interest&#13;
to women.&#13;
44.         Support, at a fixed unit cost per learner, will be provided to NGOs. The program&#13;
will use DNFE materials for the first nine months. Postliteracy materials will be flexible, consisting&#13;
of either DNFE or NGO materials. Preference will be given to NGOs with integrated programs&#13;
such as rural development programs, or income generation programs. Teachers and supervisors&#13;
will be recruited by NGOs and employed for the duration of the one-year course. It is estimated&#13;
that approximately 79,000 teachers and 5,300 supervisors will be trained during the Project&#13;
period. Training of supervisors and teachers will take place in buildings available in the&#13;
communities, primary training institutes, and NGO facilities.&#13;
45.         The Project will adopt a phased approach for NFE delivery, covering selected&#13;
districts to ensure maximum impact, close monitoring, and cost-effectiveness. The Project will&#13;
cover 30 districts in the country's six divisions (see Appendix 5), selected on the criteria of&#13;
literacy rates below 45 percent, availability of NGOs that can deliver NFE programs to young&#13;
adults, community demand, and accessibility. It is estimated that about 2.5 million learners will&#13;
be reached through the Project. The target figure is based on anticipated DNFE institutional&#13;
capacity to administer and monitor adult NFE programs and NGO availability and capacity.&#13;
46.         Established processes of support to NGOs already exist under INFEP, including&#13;
the Subvention Committee, which approves the selection of NGOs. Systems for administration&#13;
of the programs through NGOs, including payment for NFE delivery, and the distribution of&#13;
books and materials, have also been established. DNFE will continue to use the Subvention&#13;
Committee to review and approve NGO proposals according to the selection criteria agreed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
upon under the Project. The Subvention Committee will be chaired by a senior official of PMED&#13;
and have representatives from PMED, DNFE, Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division,&#13;
the Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance, Economic Relations Division, Directorate of Social&#13;
Welfare, NGO Bureau, and local representatives of the Bank, IDA, and SDC. DNFE will continue&#13;
to use the existing mechanism to contract NFE delivery to NGOs, which involves advertisements&#13;
to invite proposals from NGOs, screening of NGOs according to established criteria, selection,&#13;
orientation, and submission by NGOs of the names of master trainers, supervisors, and teachers&#13;
to receive training. The selection criteria for NGOs are shown in Appendix 6.&#13;
47.         The Project will finance instructional costs, with the average cost estimated at Tk&#13;
495 ($12) for the one-year course. Costs include consumables (notebooks, pencils), instructional&#13;
materials (blackboards, textbooks, flip charts, chalk, dusters), teacher and supervisor training,&#13;
and honoraria. General administration, administration overheads, and development costs of&#13;
NGOs are not included. Provision has also been made for workshops for NGOs that may need&#13;
training in, for example, management and accounting procedures. Once the NFE programs have&#13;
been completed in one area, NGOs will focus on a new area with low literacy, using a new set&#13;
of teachers and supervisors. The Project will, therefore, not create a permanent cadre of field&#13;
staff that have to be maintained.&#13;
b.    Quality Improvement&#13;
48.         Existing training programs, curriculum and materials for adults need to be&#13;
researched, evaluated, and revised. These activities should involve teachers, learners, and&#13;
communities to ensure that the NFE program meets the needs of the participants. A variety of&#13;
postliteracy materials needs to be developed to sustain the skills of the learners since at present&#13;
very few materials are available. To support these program development activities, research is&#13;
needed to determine, for example, methods that will facilitate the teaching of literacy and content&#13;
areas for postliteracy. To ensure progress toward program objectives, close monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of NGOs and learner performance will be essential. The Project will provide&#13;
subcontract services through individuals, research agencies or private or nonprofit firms for&#13;
curriculum and materials revision, development of postliteracy materials, training program&#13;
development, special research projects, evaluation of program efficiency, and monitoring of NGO&#13;
contracts.&#13;
c.    Alternative NFE Models and Social Mobilization&#13;
49.         The Project will assist pilot programs to (i) develop alternative NFE models and&#13;
approaches for meeting special needs, and (ii) support the ongoing upgrading of the overall&#13;
program quality. Costed proposals from NGOs will be submitted to DNFE for review and&#13;
selection and to the Bank for information (see Appendix 6).&#13;
50.        INFEP is currently supporting a Total Literacy Movement (TLM), a campaign&#13;
approach that is implemented through district-level committees, using voluntary teachers and&#13;
relying on mass mobilization. The Project will finance further piloting of TLM in two districts&#13;
during the first year. Based on the evaluation undertaken at the end of the nine-month program&#13;
in the two pilot districts, a decision will be taken whether to finance TLM in more districts,&#13;
reallocating part of the funds for delivery through NGOs to TLM. Support for books to the&#13;
Govemment-financed TLM or to other voluntary groups will be part of the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
51.          Sustained national awareness, commitment, and community partnership with NFE&#13;
implementors are vital for the success of the program. Social mobilization, involving political&#13;
leadership, public representatives, community leaders, religious leaders, workers of political&#13;
parties, NGO professionals, parents, and students will increase the chance of success of NFE&#13;
programs. Social mobilization activities in Bangladesh are presently targeted toward enrollment&#13;
and retention in primary schools. The Project will finance a complementary social mobilization&#13;
strategy to create a demand for NFE, involving, for example, the mass media, folk media, and&#13;
print materials.&#13;
C.    Cost Estimates&#13;
52.          The total cost of the Project is estimated at $51.0 million equivalent, including&#13;
taxes, duties, and contingencies, of which an estimated $4.3 million, or 8 percent, is the foreign&#13;
exchange cost, including $0.8 million of service charge on the proposed loan. The local currency&#13;
cost is estimated at $46.7 million equivalent, or 92 percent of the total cost. A summary of the&#13;
cost estimates is shown in Table 1 and details are given in Appendix 7.&#13;

The total cost is based on a unit cost per learner breakdown of 35 percent teachers' honoraria, 5 percent&#13;
supervisors' honoraria, 10 percent staff training, and 50 percent materials cost.&#13;
Estimated at 10 percent of building costs and 5 percent for other facilities.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D.   Financing Plan&#13;
53.        The Govemment has requested the Bank to finance $26.7 million equivalent from&#13;
Its Special Funds resources. The Bank loan will finance 30 percent of the foreign exchange cost&#13;
and 54 percent of the local currency cost of the Project. Bank financing of the local currency&#13;
costs includes primarily civil works, equipment, and support to NFE delivery. The Bank loan will&#13;
be repayable over 40 years with a grace period of 10 years and a service charge of 1 percent&#13;
per annum. The Government has also requested IDA to provide a loan in an amount equivalent&#13;
to $10.5 million. SDC is expected to provide about $3.8 million on a grant basis to finance&#13;
institutional capacity building for NFE. The Bank, IDA, and SDC will together finance 100 percent&#13;
of the foreign exchange cost and 78 percent of the local currency cost, totaling 80 percent of the&#13;
estimated Project cost (see Table 2). The effectiveness of the cofinancing agreements with IDA&#13;
and SDC are conditions of loan effectiveness. The Government will provide the remaining $10&#13;
million equivalent, including DNFE staff salaries, NFE delivery, facilities, and equipment. Details&#13;
of the financing plan are in Appendix 7.&#13;

E.   Implementation Arrangements&#13;
1.    Executing Agency&#13;
54.         DNFE, under PMED, will be the Executing Agency for the Project. DNFE, headed&#13;
by the Director General, will have overall responsibility for planning, organization, management,&#13;
supervision, and coordination related to the Project as well as monitoring the progress achieved.&#13;
DNFE has not had any experience implementing a Bank project; however, INFEP has over the&#13;
last three years managed external assistance from multilateral and bilateral agencies. To ensure&#13;
effective implementation, technical assistance and additional staff are being provided under the&#13;
Project to strengthen the institutional capacity to manage the Project in the areas of planning and&#13;
programming, management information systems (MIS), monitoring and evaluation, and field&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
2.    Project Implementation Management Unit&#13;
55.         For effective implementation of the Project, a Project Implementation Management&#13;
Unit (PIMU) will be established within DNFE and will be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
implementation and administration of the Project. PIMU will be headed by a full-time Project&#13;
Director, assisted by seven full-time staff (Appendix 8). Throughout Project implementation, PIMU&#13;
will be supported by the strengthened organizational units within DNFE, in particular the&#13;
Operations Unit, which is responsible for program implementation and field operations at the&#13;
district and thana levels.&#13;
3.    Project Coordination Committee&#13;
56.         A Project Coordination Committee (PCC) under PMED will be constituted to be&#13;
responsible for (i) coordinating Project activities among PMED, other Government agencies,&#13;
NGOs, and other organizations in the Project; (ii) reviewing and approving sector policy&#13;
adjustments; (iii) monitoring the general progress of the Project; and (iv) reviewing and approving&#13;
annual implementation plans. PCC will be chaired by the Secretary of PMED, and will consist&#13;
of senior staff from PMED, DNFE, the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of Finance, a&#13;
representative of the national organization of NGOs active in NFE, and the Project Director of&#13;
PIMU.&#13;
4.    Subproject Implementation&#13;
57.         The delivery of NFE programs will be undertaken by NGOs fulfilling the selection&#13;
criteria (see Appendix 6), and with records demonstrating effective literacy and community-&#13;
organizing and community-development programs. Initial screening and identification of NGOs&#13;
will be undertaken by DNFE and approved by the Subvention Committee. All NGOs will&#13;
implement the same nine-month core NFE program while postliteracy programs may vary to&#13;
accommodate special learner needs. A key function of NGOs in the implementation of the&#13;
various subprojects will be the effective management of all field activities, especially in carrying&#13;
out baseline surveys including a profile of the target population, and maintaining records of&#13;
student intake, delivery services, output evaluation, financial and accounting records, and&#13;
continuing outreach programs. Close coordination and cooperation between NGOs and the&#13;
district coordinators will be maintained throughout the delivery programs to ensure effective&#13;
implementation.&#13;
5.   Implementation Schedule&#13;
58.         The Project will be implemented over a period of five years. A detailed&#13;
implementation schedule is in Appendix 9.&#13;
6.    Procurement of Goods and Services&#13;
59.         All procurement for the Bank-financed portion of the Project will be in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts under the Project will consist&#13;
of the headquarters building, which will be of standard concrete construction. Because of the&#13;
simplicity of the civil works and the likely lack of interest by international contractors, it is&#13;
proposed that civil works contracts be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
following Government procedures acceptable to the Bank. To the extent possible, procurement&#13;
of equipment, service vehicles, and materials will be arranged for international competitive&#13;
bidding. For the supply of equipment consisting of service vehicles, training equipment, and&#13;
office equipment, each contract in excess of $500,000 will follow international competitive&#13;
procedures; international shopping procedures will be used for packages valued at $500,000 or&#13;
less. Furniture and associated office supplies will be procured through local competitive bidding&#13;
because of the small size of the contract packages and the likely lack of interest of international&#13;
suppliers. Minor items costing less than $50,000 equivalent will be procured under direct&#13;
purchase in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to the Bank. Procurement for&#13;
IDA components will follow IDA's procurement guidelines.&#13;
60.         PIMU will be responsible for procurement under the guidance and supervision of&#13;
the Director General of DNFE. Specifically, PIMU will (i) determine bid packages and propose&#13;
procurement methods; (ii) prepare detailed materials lists and specifications; (iii) where&#13;
applicable, determine prequalifications criteria, evaluation criteria, and completion of delivery&#13;
periods; and (iv) evaluate bids, determine lowest evaluated and substantially responsive bids,&#13;
and certify payments. Approval of contracts and certification of payments will be made by DNFE.&#13;
Copies of all contracts and supporting documents will subsequently be forwarded to the Bank&#13;
and IDA for record and, where necessary, for approval.&#13;
7.    Consulting Services, Fellowships, and Training&#13;
61.         Sixty person-months for two international consultants and 138 person-months for&#13;
five domestic consultants will be required to support the institutional development of DNFE in&#13;
all aspects of its NFE delivery system. All consultants will be selected and engaged in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A schedule of consultant&#13;
requirements and brief terms of reference are in Appendix 3. For local fellowships, the&#13;
Government will submit sample training programs/modules, criteria for selection of candidates,&#13;
and a list of nominated candidates for information to the Bank. For external fellowship training&#13;
at duly approved institutions, the Government will follow identified criteria and procedures for&#13;
award of fellowships, and provide a list of the nominated candidates and their qualifications, the&#13;
nominated institutions, and details and cost of the proposed courses. The Bank's approval is&#13;
required prior to acceptance of the external fellowships.&#13;
8.    Disbursements, Reports, Accounts, and Auditing&#13;
62.         The Government, acting through DNFE, will maintain records and accounts&#13;
adequate to identify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loan. DNFE and&#13;
participating NGOs will (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure accounts and&#13;
financial statements are audited annually in accordance with sound accounting principles by&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (iii) submit to the Bank, not later than 12 months after the&#13;
close of each fiscal year, audit reports and audited financial statements related to the Project.&#13;
63.         To expedite Project implementation through the timely release of funds, a dollar&#13;
imprest account for the Bank will be established by the Government at a commercial bank&#13;
designated by Bangladesh Bank and similarly a special account for IDA within one month of loan&#13;
effectiveness. Government contributions to the Project will be maintained in a separate account.&#13;
Items eligible for financing under this account will include local currency expenditures including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
indirect foreign exchange cost, and small foreign expenditures not exceeding $50,000 per&#13;
payment. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's Guidelines on Imprest Funds and Statement of Expenditure (SOE) Procedures.&#13;
Similarly, the special account will be established, managed and liquidated according to&#13;
applicable IDA procedures. Replenishment will be subject to the liquidation of expenditures.&#13;
Imprest account and expenditures reimbursed or replenished and liquidated under SOE&#13;
procedures shall be audited by a qualified auditor acceptable to the Bank, and discussed&#13;
separately in the audit reports. Such audit may be carried out as part of the regular annual audit&#13;
of the Executing Agency's general accounts, and the report should be submitted to the Bank on&#13;
an annual basis.&#13;
64.         DNFE will prepare and provide, through PIMU, quarterly reports on the&#13;
implementation of the Project and submit them to the Bank and IDA within 30 days of the&#13;
respective periods. The reports will be in a format acceptable to the Bank and IDA and will&#13;
indicate, among other things, the progress made against established targets, including quality&#13;
aspects; problems encountered during the period under review; actions taken/proposed to&#13;
resolve problems; compliance with loan covenants; and proposed programs of activities to be&#13;
undertaken during the succeeding quarter. Within three months of the physical completion of&#13;
the Project, the Government will prepare and submit to the Bank and IDA a Project completion&#13;
report providing details of implementation, benefits, and evaluation.&#13;
9.    Midterm Review&#13;
65.         The Government, the Bank, IDA, and SDC will jointly undertake a midterm review&#13;
(MTR) of the Project after the second year of implementation. Subcontract services are provided&#13;
under the Project to prepare a midterm evaluation report prior to the joint MTR. The MTR will&#13;
review the scope, design, implementation arrangements, institutional processes, and other&#13;
relevant issues in the light of the Government's development strategies and the policy framework&#13;
and strategic social concerns of the Bank; identify changes needed since the time of appraisal;&#13;
reassess the impact with regard to future Project implementation and sustainability; assess&#13;
implementation performance against Project performance indicators (see Appendix 10); review&#13;
and establish compliance with various loan covenants; identify problems and constraints; and,&#13;
if necessary, recommend changes in the design or implementation of the Project.&#13;
10.   Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
66.         A BME system will be established to provide accurate, relevant, timely, and&#13;
systemized information and feedback on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Project&#13;
and to ensure appropriate adjustments in Project inputs and management during&#13;
implementation. System monitoring has been identified as one of the weaknesses in the present&#13;
INFEP (para. 16), and BME in past Bank-assisted projects has not been very successful. The&#13;
Project is, therefore, providing support to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation aspects. The&#13;
existing monitoring and evaluation system of the education sector as well as the present INFEP&#13;
MIS will be reviewed and improved to increase the capacity to keep track of a large number of&#13;
learners and activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
67.          BME will include three subsystems: (i) NFE-MIS to ensure efficient data collection&#13;
and interpretation; (ii) sample monitoring of NFE performance and institutional and process&#13;
monitoring; and (iii) research and evaluation studies on the effectiveness, sustainability, and&#13;
impact of NFE delivery models. Results from BME will be interpreted against baseline surveys&#13;
conducted in the target areas prior to start-up. NFE-MIS will be established in DNFE, and be an&#13;
integral part of the overall PMED BME and MIS systems. The system will also serve as a&#13;
resource base for dissemination and information, and for coordinating and pooling available&#13;
resources for NFE programs. BME will be established and undertaken with the help of&#13;
international and domestic consultants in the Project and specialist staff under PIMU. PIMU, in&#13;
cooperation with DNFE, will establish the guidelines on the operations of the BME system within&#13;
six months of loan effectiveness.&#13;
68.          The success of the Project will be measured by the following performance criteria:&#13;
(i) institutional capacity of DNFE to support delivery of NFE programs as measured by&#13;
appointment and training of staff, establishment of planning and management and NFE-MIS and&#13;
BME information systems, in-house training capacity, and number of contracts to NGOs; (ii)&#13;
quality of training programs and learning materials, as measured by teachers' demonstrated&#13;
mastery of and confidence in the teaching methodology and the materials they teach; (iii)&#13;
coverage of learners and learner achievement in literacy, numeracy, and life skills; and (iv)&#13;
effectiveness of the NFE programs in enhancing the learners' socioeconomic status as measured&#13;
by the impact assessment study. A summary of Project performance indicators and monitoring&#13;
mechanisms is given in Appendix 10.&#13;
F.    Environment and Social Measures&#13;
69.          The environmental impact of the Project as a consequence of minor civil works&#13;
for the construction of one headquarters building is minimal. Standard environmental safeguards&#13;
for construction of buildings will be followed to minimize local impact. Prior to construction, the&#13;
Government will provide the Bank with an initial environmental examination and, if required, an&#13;
environmental impact assessment. With respect to content of the life skills component of the&#13;
NFE, the program is expected to disseminate broad awareness of environmentally sound health,&#13;
sanitation, hygiene, and family planning practices. In view of the scope of the NFE program and&#13;
the importance of the health and sanitation issue in the Bangladesh context, these positive&#13;
impacts can be significant among the participants.&#13;
70.          The Project will support the existing practice of community involvement in terms&#13;
of identification of learners, provision of shelter to learners, recruitment of teachers from the local&#13;
community, and the establishment of a management committee. It will also involve the&#13;
community in the revision of curriculum and development of postliteracy and continuing&#13;
education materials. The proposed Project further incorporates the major identified strategies to&#13;
promote education of females, i.e., NFE centers are located within the community, female&#13;
teachers are hired for female groups, the instruction is free of cost, a gender-responsive MIS&#13;
system is designed, and support is given to experimental models and social mobilization.'&#13;
A regional seminar was held at the Bank on 30 May - 2 June 1994 as the final activity of RETA No. 5513:&#13;
Education of Women in Asia, for $500,000, approved on 4 December 1992. The seminar identNfied strategies&#13;
for the Bank to promote female education in the region as follows: (i) locate schools closer to the community,&#13;
(ii) promote hiring of female teachers, (iii) lower costs to parents, (iv) develop relevant curricula and materials,&#13;
(v) promote research on gender issues, (vi) design gender-specific data and information systems, (vii)&#13;
support training, (viii) increase community participation, (ix) promote advocacy and social mobilization, and&#13;
(x) support muftiple delivery systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Internal and external training in NFE for DNFE personnel will further the strengthen the key&#13;
personnel for planning and implementation in the participatory approaches to program design&#13;
and delivery.&#13;
G.   Technical Assistance&#13;
71.         Technical assistance (TA), which is expected to be financed by SDC, is proposed&#13;
to accompany the loan. The TA will assist DNFE by developing capacity in the areas of planning,&#13;
monitoring, and evaluation; NFE training as well as quality improvement and research activities;&#13;
pilot programs; and workshops for NGOs. The TA is needed to address system weaknesses in&#13;
monitoring and evaluation as well as program quality and staff development needs (see paras.&#13;
14-16).&#13;
72.         The main objectives of the TA are to (i) set up planning, monitoring, and&#13;
evaluation systems capable of handling larger NFE programs; (ii) upgrade the professional skills&#13;
of DNFE staff and NGOs; and (iii) improve training programs and support other quality aspects&#13;
of NFE. To accomplish these objectives, two long-term international consultants, five domestic&#13;
consultants, and local contract staff will be engaged. The detailed terms of reference are in&#13;
Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by a consulting firm.&#13;
73.        International consultants will provide primary input into planning, monitoring, and&#13;
evaluation, and NFE training and program improvement in close consultation with senior DNFE&#13;
staff counterparts. Domestic consultants will provide support to the Planning, Programming,&#13;
Monitoring, and Evaluation Unit and the Finance and Administration Unit of DNFE. One domestic&#13;
consultant will provide assistance to the Project Director, PIMU, on the ongoing BME component&#13;
of the Project. Local contract staff will be engaged as core trainers, management trainers, and&#13;
assistant monitors to support NFE program delivery. They will provide an important link between&#13;
headquarters and field activities. One audiovisual technician will also be engaged as local&#13;
contract staff to support TSSU.&#13;
74.         External certificate courses in the various NFE disciplines will be provided to DNFE&#13;
staff, and management training to NGOs. Specialist subcontracting services will be provided for&#13;
short-term technical input, mainly for quality improvement, research, and evaluation. The&#13;
subcontracting services will enable DNFE to draw upon an open pool of expertise of individuals&#13;
and agencies. Pilot projects to test different NFE models and materials are also part of the TA.&#13;
75.         The TA is expected to be financed by SDC on a grant basis in an amount of about&#13;
$3.8 million, including $1.8 million in foreign exchange costs and $2.0 million equivalent in local&#13;
currency costs.&#13;
H.   Policy Issues&#13;
76.         The Project will assist the Govemment in providing the foundation for the&#13;
development of NFE. Critical policy issues concern financial sustainability and the pace of NFE&#13;
expansion. At present, only 4.3 percent (2.0 percent of the Government's own resources) of the&#13;
development budget of the education sector is allocated to NFE. The expansion of NFE calls for&#13;
a higher proportion of Government development expenditures directed at NFE in the medium&#13;
and long-term through reallocation from, for example, the highly subsidized secondary and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
higher education subsectors. To ensure the availability of counterpart funds, the Government will&#13;
provide the Bank, IDA, and SDC with annual draft NFE operations and financing plans for&#13;
comments. The plans will be discussed during a joint supervision mission, prior to finalizing the&#13;
budget proposal, and the comments of the Bank, IDA, and SDC will be taken into account.&#13;
77.         To reach the proposed Government target of making 20.8 million adults literate&#13;
by the year 2000 (para. 17), about 4 million learners would need to be provided with NFE&#13;
annually. This would be a more than fivefold increase from the current INFEP capacity. To ensure&#13;
the quality of programs, learner achievement, and cost-effectiveness, a phased approach in&#13;
selected districts will be necessary until institutional capacity to implement a larger program is&#13;
developed. The emphasis on planning, monitoring, and evaluation inputs under the Project will&#13;
provide policy makers and planners with necessary data and information to adjust targets to&#13;
capacity.&#13;
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A.    Socioeconomic Analysis&#13;
78.         Over 10 million very poor, illiterate, young learners have currently very few&#13;
opportunities to achieve literacy and life skills that would enhance their productivity and improve&#13;
the quality of their own and their children's lives. Women are particularly vulnerable and&#13;
underserved. Investments are therefore needed in a central organizational structure that can&#13;
plan, provide and support quality NFE as well as provide a means to reach larger groups with&#13;
programs that will help them help themselves.&#13;
1.    Project Beneficiaries and Benefits&#13;
79.         Data from a socioeconomic profile of the beneficiaries show that a typical learner&#13;
will be poor and malnourished, live in the rural areas, own no land or no significant quantum of&#13;
land and assets, have little opportunity for occupational or geographic mobility, be illiterate, and&#13;
be only seasonally employed. If female, the learner is likely to be married, may not use&#13;
contraception and therefore will bear many children, have malnourished children, live a shorter&#13;
life than men, have little decision-making power, and have limited mobility outside the home.&#13;
Since more than two thirds of the Project beneficiaries are poor and the most disadvantaged are&#13;
females, the Project will contribute to poverty reduction and improvement of the status of women&#13;
by providing about 2.5 million young adults with literacy, numeracy, and life skills including&#13;
health, nutrition, hygiene, family planning, civic rights, and income-generating practices. The&#13;
content of the NFE program will be useful for both women and men; but since women are&#13;
traditionally responsible for the welfare of the family, the content will particularly address their&#13;
needs.&#13;
80.         Evidence from ongoing NFE programs for adults indicates a pent-up demand from&#13;
the young adults, particularly females, who for economic reasons have been deprived of&#13;
education in the past. Women presently constitute 60-70 percent of the participants and their&#13;
retention rate is higher than that for men. While the number of learners to be reached under the&#13;
Project may be a small percentage of the total need (about 12 percent), it is estimated that this&#13;
is the maximum expansion that can help assure quality delivery. The Project will also have a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
long-term impact on the remaining illiterates through the enhanced institutional capacity of&#13;
DNFE.&#13;
81.         Upon completion of the Project, Bangladesh will have DNFE capable of delivering&#13;
NFE on a larger scale, trained staff at the central and local levels to support NFE programs,&#13;
improved NFE training program and materials, and a mechanism for system evaluation. The&#13;
establishment of an effective educational management system and BME system will enhance&#13;
managerial efficiency and improve project planning and implementation and therefore contribute&#13;
to enhanced cost-efficiency and overall project cost-effectiveness. These outputs will be&#13;
important prerequisites to the increase of functional education and literacy skills of the&#13;
population, which will contribute in several ways to medium-term and long-term poverty&#13;
reduction.&#13;
2.    Sustainability&#13;
a.    Institutional Viability&#13;
82.         To address the magnitude of the illiteracy problem, the Government should adopt&#13;
a long-term development model with an initial focus on basic education and functional literacy,&#13;
and then gradually over time on other NFE needs such as continuing education and skills&#13;
development. A permanent structure for NFE is therefore needed to plan, coordinate, support,&#13;
and monitor a national NFE program in the long term. The Project will assist in transforming&#13;
INFEP into DNFE which will be financed under the development budget during the Project cycle,&#13;
and later under the revenue budget after Project completion to ensure institutional&#13;
sustainability.' DNFE's personnel capabilities will be enhanced, to enable it to effectively&#13;
implement NFE and ensure its quality. Through DNFE's enhanced professional expertise base,&#13;
the institution will also be able to support and assist other agencies involved in NFE activities.&#13;
Professional expertise in NFE will also enable DNFE to provide input into policies and plans and&#13;
to initiate reforms. The strengthened statistical educational data base and its effective utilization&#13;
will favorably affect sector and project management.&#13;
83.         To be responsive to the flexible nature of NFE, DNFE's role will be to ensure policy&#13;
implementation, provision of technical support, coordination and monitoring of progress and the&#13;
use of allocated funds. The implementation structure will be decentralized. NGOs and the field&#13;
administration will manage and implement programs. Large NGOs already have the necessary&#13;
management and administration structures; smaller NGOs will be supported, as needed, through&#13;
training. Supervisors and teachers will be trained locally and teachers will come from the&#13;
involved communities.&#13;
b.    Financial Viability&#13;
84.          Allocations for the education sector represented about 14 percent of the total&#13;
development budget in FY1 995/96, including an allocation of 4.3 percent to the NFE subsector.&#13;
Allocations to INFEP are totally funded by the development budget. The Project will require a&#13;
minimum increase of about 5 percent annually in real terms from the Government budget, which&#13;
I     The Directorate of Primary Education, PMED, similarly was first created under the development budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
is small considering that the Government budget for NFE has been growing at over 100 percent&#13;
during the last three fiscal years. The Project does not involve cost recovery in cash from the&#13;
direct beneficiaries because of the Government's policy of free and compulsory primary&#13;
education and its EFA policy. The target group is the poorest segment of society and any cash&#13;
contribution will pose a barrier to access, particularly for women. Their participation in itsell will&#13;
represent a contribution in terms of opportunity cost. Presently, NGOs provide NFE free of cost,&#13;
which is a key to attract the poor. The cash contribution that beneficiaries may be able to make&#13;
would be insignificant and necessitate cumbersome logistics and high administration costs. The&#13;
communities, however, make a significant contribution by providing accommodations for NFE&#13;
activities and items such as mats. Under the present INFEP scheme, NGOs also subsidize NFE&#13;
delivery by an estimated 10 to 15 percent.&#13;
85.         By making optimal use of existing staff and institutional facilities, the Project will&#13;
be able to provide NFE to the target beneficiaries in a cost-effective manner. The NFE unit costs&#13;
are, by any standards in the world, low. Current INFEP estimates show that it will cost an&#13;
average of $12 per adult learner to complete a NFE program. In comparison, the annual&#13;
recurrent costs for a primary school student is reported to be around $15. Other substantial&#13;
private costs are associated with attending formal schools. The minimal cost of NFE programs&#13;
is a result of the free provision of accommodations, low direct operating costs, and very small&#13;
honoraria for the teachers.&#13;
3.    Project Risks&#13;
86.         Project risks encompass management capability, including possible delays in the&#13;
recruitment of new staff, and planning and coordination of a large number of NGO-implemented&#13;
activities. To assist in management and timely implementation, a detailed action plan for the&#13;
Project has been prepared. Furthermore, a long-term international consultant will assist in&#13;
program planning and monitoring, and NFE delivery is phased to peak during the last two years&#13;
of the Project to allow buildup of capacity. INFEP already has experience in managing NFE&#13;
programs delivered by over 100 NGOs. To further minimize risks related to management and&#13;
coordination of NGOs, the Project provides staff and consultancy support to DNFE's Finance and&#13;
Administration Unit, which will enable the Unit to take on increased administration tasks and&#13;
ensure effective disbursement. The successful partnership between the Government and NGOs&#13;
depends on the involvement of NGOs at all levels. In the past, NGOs have not been involved in&#13;
policy and planning. The structures for NFE under the Project will ensure involvement in these&#13;
areas.&#13;
87.         The second risk relates to the teachers' capability to facilitate learning and thereby&#13;
ensuring regular student attendance and achievement of core competencies as well as the risk&#13;
of learners dropping out for reasons outside the teacher's control such as family problems. To&#13;
perform effectively, the teacher will need the necessary tools of good training, relevant materials,&#13;
supportive supervision, and assistance in how to test learners. The Project provides for revision&#13;
of existing training programs and materials, development of postliteracy materials, and&#13;
development of instruments to test learners' performance. In addition, there is provision for an&#13;
annual assessment on a sample basis to evaluate NGO and learners' performance. The annual&#13;
assessment will facilitate a dialogue among DNFE, the Bank, IDA, and SDC to ensure that quality&#13;
targets are being met.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
B.    Social Dimensions&#13;
88.         Project activities will be carried out in areas that exhibit high population density;&#13;
scarce productive resources; skewed distribution of wealth, opportunity, and resources; low&#13;
agricultural productivity; inadequate industrial development; high illiteracy; low use of modern&#13;
technology in productive work including agriculture; inadequate access to modern health&#13;
facilities; and limited sanitation.&#13;
89.         As the Project profile shows (para. 79), there is a great need for NFE programs&#13;
for literacy and to improve knowledge of and practices related to health, sanitation, family&#13;
planning, population issues, civic rights, and income-generating activities. Because of poverty,&#13;
illiterate adults have in the past not been able to afford going to school. In addition, if they are&#13;
females, they may not have been encouraged to do so. Until recently, very few NFE&#13;
opportunities and programs were available for adults. Under the Project, NFE programs for&#13;
young adults will improve the learners' chances of entry into nonfarm activities with a higher&#13;
income potential. Improvements in worker productivity and earnings in all sectors of the formal&#13;
and informal economy will be facilitated by literacy and numeracy skills. Since women are&#13;
already the majority of learners and will continue to be the focus of attention under the Project,&#13;
it is anticipated that the NFE programs will improve the health and welfare of their children, lower&#13;
fertility rates, postpone marriage for and result in higher school attendance for their children. NFE&#13;
will also empower women to participate more actively in the affairs of their families and&#13;
communities.&#13;
VI. ASSURANCES&#13;
A.    Specific Assurances&#13;
90.         The Government has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard&#13;
assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:&#13;
(i)     The operational Project costs of DNFE will be transferred to the revenue&#13;
budget promptly after Project completion.&#13;
(ii)    The Bank and IDA will be provided with a copy of a detailed, costed out&#13;
program and plan for NFE and DNFE for the period 1996-2000 within six&#13;
months of loan effectiveness.&#13;
(iii)   A draft annual NFE operations and financing plan, including subprojects&#13;
to be carried out under the Project, will be furnished to the Bank for&#13;
comments by 31 March of each year during Project implementation.&#13;
(iv)    PIMU, in cooperation with DNFE, will establish the guidelines on the&#13;
operations of the BME system within six months of loan effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
B.   Condfflon of Loan Effectivenes&#13;
(i)     The Government will establish the National Council for Primary and Mass&#13;
Education before loan effectivity.&#13;
VII. RECOMMENDATION&#13;
91.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement&#13;
of the Bank and recommend that the Board approve the loan In various currencies equivalent&#13;
to Special Drawing Rights 17,592,000 to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Nonformal&#13;
Education Project, with a service charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum and with an&#13;
amortization of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years and such other terms and&#13;
conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement&#13;
presented to the Board.&#13;

EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO NONFORMAL EDUCATION IN BANGLADESH&#13;
A.   Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA)&#13;
1.         Between 1978 and 1991, DANIDA provided support to basic primary and adult&#13;
education as part of the Integrated Rural Development Program in Noakhali district. The activities&#13;
included preschool and two years of primary education for children, and functional adult&#13;
education including a skills training program for women. It presently supports the&#13;
Underprivileged Children's Education Program (UCEP), a program for poor working and street&#13;
children; and the primary and adolescent program within Gono ShahaJio Sangsta (GSS).&#13;
B.   Directorate General for International Cooperation (DGIS)&#13;
2.         Under the General Education Project (GEP), DGIS is supporting the Nonformal&#13;
Education (NFE) component in the amount of $4.2 million. Support is provided to 17&#13;
Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) to deliver nonformal primary education (NFPE)&#13;
programs to out-of-school children. The NGO programs differ in length, curriculum, contact&#13;
hours, and cost. A total of about 3,100 centers are supported under GEP. DGIS is also&#13;
supporting the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee's (BRAC) NFPE program with $8.3&#13;
million, and plans to support GSS.&#13;
C.   Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD)&#13;
3.         NORAD is supporting INFEP programs for adolescents (11-14 years) and adults&#13;
(15-25 years) implemented by NGOs, provision of books and posters for postliteracy, staff&#13;
training, and evaluation. The support to INFEP amounts to $4 million for 1994-1995.&#13;
D.   Overseas Development Administration (ODA)&#13;
4.         ODA is currently funding four NGO education programs. BRAC's NFPE receives&#13;
about $3 million, Proshika receives $7.3 million for NFPE and adult literacy programs, UCEP is&#13;
supported by $370,000 for their program for street children and Friends in Village Development,&#13;
Bangladesh receives about $12,500 for early childhood programs. ODA is presently appraising&#13;
GSS with a possible amount of $3 million.&#13;
E.   Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)&#13;
5.         SIDA supports the NFE component under GEP together with DGIS in the amount&#13;
of $4.2 million. Support is also provided to INFEP's adolescent NFE program (through UNICEF),&#13;
adult literacy program, the Total Literacy Movement, and the strengthening of monitoring through&#13;
10 monitoring associates. SIDA's total financing to INFEP is about $3.5 million for the period&#13;
1994-1996. SIDA also provides direct support to NGOs; about $2.7 million to BRAC's rural&#13;
development program, women's health and development programs and NFPE; $4.6 million to&#13;
GSS education and advocacy program; and about $0.5 million to the Campaign for Popular&#13;
Education for advocacy and networking.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                     Appendix 1, page 2&#13;
F.   United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)&#13;
6.          UNICEF has been the principal source of funding for INFEP between 1991 and&#13;
1995, providing about $14 million. It provides support to early childhood development and NFE&#13;
programs for children (6-10 and 11-14 years) delivered through NGOs. Inputs are for curricula,&#13;
teacher training and materials development, training workshops, social mobilization as well as&#13;
actual program delivery. About 9,400 centers serving around 217,000 children have been&#13;
supported. UNICEF has also provided direct assistance to BRAC's NFPE schools, and schools&#13;
for older children (11-16 years). Assistance to BRAC has helped support 23,320 centers for over&#13;
747,140 children.&#13;
7.         In its next country program (1996-2000), UNICEF will continue to support NFE for&#13;
children through its Intensive District Approach to Education for All (IDEAL). Under IDEAL,&#13;
UNICEF will promote and support the establishment of satellite schools and community schools&#13;
as a complementary intervention to primary schools, and provide the cost of teachers' salaries&#13;
and equipment. The estimated total cost for IDEAL is $192,500 million, with $84 million UNICEF&#13;
contribution. No breakdown of NFE financing out of the total cost has been done. UNICEF will&#13;
also support NGO-implemented NFE programs for 1.4 million hard-to-reach urban children at a&#13;
total cost of about $35 million, of which $20 million is the estimated UNICEF contribution.&#13;
G.   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)&#13;
8.          UNDP has supported NFE since 1988. Currently $1.8 million has been allocated&#13;
for its ongoing project with INFEP up to 1996. Assistance to INFEP includes institution capacity&#13;
building for the development and production of curricula and teaching materials, development&#13;
of cascade training systems; training of district coordinators, supervisors, and teachers; and&#13;
delivery through NGOs of adult literacy programs for learners aged 15-35.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
37                       Appendix 3, page 8&#13;
a.    Research Projects&#13;
14.         Over the course of Project implementation research studies will be carried out&#13;
periodically through TSSU to meet program needs such as the identification of appropriate&#13;
materials and methods, implementation strategies, NGO baseline data, and assessment&#13;
processes.&#13;
15.         Specific examples of priority topics to be considered for research projects are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(i)    NGO data base: The establishment of a- NGO data base will involve the&#13;
development of survey instruments to update information on NGOs implementing&#13;
NFE programs. The surveys will establish the location (district, thana) of NGOs,&#13;
the type of NFE programs they provide and location, capacity as measured by the&#13;
centers for each NFE target group, number of learners, supervisors, and teachers.&#13;
The information collected will be fed into DNFE's MIS.&#13;
(ii)   Social and economic impact of participation in NFE programs: The NFE program&#13;
for young adults will be evaluated to determine the socioeconomic impact. This&#13;
will include tracer studies and case studies of selected learners to determine the&#13;
effect of the NFE program on literacy, social awareness, and family and personal&#13;
life. In-depth interviews will be conducted on topics such as family structure,&#13;
marriage, status, child education, fertility, contraception, child care, decision&#13;
making, medical knowledge, use of medical facilities, and income-generating&#13;
activities.&#13;
(iii)   Content areas for postliteracy materials: A variety of postliteracy materials that&#13;
meet learners' needs and interests will have to be developed. Researchers will&#13;
work with a cross section of the target communities and learners to ensure their&#13;
involvement in defining the content and outcome of their learning. The&#13;
participatory process may include learners who (a) discuss and reflect on issues&#13;
and problems of their lives, (b) discuss root causes to the problems, (c) examine&#13;
implications and consequences of issues, (d) decide on themes and main&#13;
characters who address the issue or the problem, and (e) outline a story. Themes&#13;
on materials for entertainment will also be explored. The research will provide a&#13;
list of themes and story outlines. The resultant materials will reflect the learners'&#13;
own lives and issues and will be used for a problem-posing educational process.&#13;
(iv)   Patterns of organization and teaching methods to maximize student learning in&#13;
NFE: Research will explore a range of alternative patterns of organization of&#13;
learning and teaching methods that are effective. Variables may include training&#13;
the teacher to act as a facilitator rather than director of learning, instructional&#13;
methods that attract and retain learners, breaking the group into smaller activity&#13;
groups, the use of different textbooks, the use of extra reading materials, the use&#13;
of creative writing, and literacy learning integrated with other village activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                       Appendix 3, page 9&#13;
(v)   Approaches to teach beginning reading: Very little research has been done on&#13;
effective ways to teach literacy to beginners. Research will Investigate different&#13;
ways of teaching reading, e.g. use of letter mnemonics, sight recognition, the&#13;
phonic approach, whole-word approach, syllable approach, whole word broken&#13;
up into syllables, etc., and come up with recommendations (including a step-by-&#13;
step process) on how to facilitate beginning reading with adults. The researchers&#13;
will present their findings at a workshop and their recommendations will be&#13;
considered for teacher training.&#13;
(vi)   Procedures used by teachers in NFE programs to diagnose and evaluate the&#13;
progress of their students: Teachers need to evaluate the progress of their&#13;
students along the learning continuum for each area of the curriculum. Currently,&#13;
this continuous assessment is subjective, based on observations of the student's&#13;
responses during class, written work, etc. Research will focus on the teachers'&#13;
practices of subjective assessment with the aim of improving teachers' training in&#13;
these skills as well as on objective measures of continuous assessment to identify&#13;
procedures that do not consume too much of the teacher's time for administration&#13;
or recording of results.&#13;
b.    Monitoring of Nongovernmental Organizations' Contracts&#13;
16.         Under the guidance of PIMU, subcontracting will be provided for external&#13;
evaluation of the NFE provision under subvention to NGOs. Each year, selected NGOs will be&#13;
evaluated against the selection criteria, contract agreements, and internal monitoring reports.&#13;
C.    Evaluation Activities&#13;
17.         Subcontracts will be let for the following activities: (i) identification of core&#13;
competencies and development, pretesting, and finalization of instruments for end-of-course&#13;
learner achievement; (ii) evaluation of the Total Literacy Movement (TLM) in pilot districts; (iii)&#13;
annual evaluation of learner achievement on a sample basis; (iv) midterm evaluation of the total&#13;
Project, prior to the Bank's, IDA's and SDC's midterm review; (v) survey of the teachers'&#13;
demonstrated mastery of the teaching methodology and confidence in the materials they teach.&#13;
d.    Curriculum Revision and Development&#13;
18.          DNFEs curriculum for basic literacy, numeracy, and life skills will be reviewed,&#13;
evaluated, and revised as required. The review will involve teachers, learners, and communities&#13;
to ensure that the topics taught are relevant to learner needs and reflective of different&#13;
community settings.&#13;
e.    Instructional Materials Revision and Development&#13;
19.         Review, evaluation, and latest curriculum revision will be incorporated into&#13;
revisions of existing instructional materials. Textbook materials will be problem-posing, present&#13;
topics, themes, and issues from the learners' point of view and encourage learners to action.&#13;
Teachers' guides will include suggestions for continuous learner assessment. Camera-ready text&#13;

for instructional materials development, including field testing, revision, and mass production.&#13;
f.    Training Program Revision and Development&#13;
20.         Training programs for Master Trainers and Core Trainers will be reviewed, revised,&#13;
developed, and implemented. The review of existing programs will involve trainers, supervisors&#13;
and learners, and observations of teachers in NFE centers.&#13;
g.    Postliteracy, Materials and Training Development&#13;
21.         Development of postliteracy materials (based on research on content) and&#13;
postliteracy training programs will be undertaken. Materials to be developed may include books,&#13;
booklets, comics, (wall) newspapers, and games.&#13;
h.    Social Mobilization&#13;
22.         Subcontracting will be provided for the implementation of DNFE's social&#13;
mobilization campaigns in selected areas. DNFE will prepare an overall social mobilization action&#13;
plan. Under this plan, local administration may submit proposals for social mobilization activities&#13;
to be undertaken at district or thana levels. Research and development activities for social&#13;
mobilization media activities or materials development will also be part of subcontracts.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Nonformal Education Project will
            assist the government in achieving "Education for
            All" (EFA) by improving and expanding nonformal
            education (NFE) to reach illiterate young adults,
            particularly females. Specifically, the project will
            strengthen NFE by: 1) assisting in the institutionalization
            of the Integrated Nonformal Education Program into a
            Directorate of NFE staffed by qualified personnel able to
            function in related tasks such as planning, training,
            monitoring, and evaluation; and 2) expanding and improving
            NFE programs to reach an estimated 2.5 million learners of
            the targeted age group through nongovernmental organizations
            (NGOs) and the local district administration. The project
            will form part of the government's overall NFE
            development program to be supported by different external agencies.
