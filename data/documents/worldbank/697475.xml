I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Scope of the Emergency&#13;
1.          Starting in February 1994 and culminating in a cascade of failures in August and&#13;
September 1994 and January 1995, leaks from the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline in the Usinsk&#13;
region of the Komi Republic have resulted in one of world's largest oil spills. In excess of&#13;
100,000 tons (730,000 barrels) of oil are estimated to be trapped in very difficult to access bogs&#13;
and creek beds, three times the amount released during the Exxon Valdez spill. In autumn 1994&#13;
over 20,000 tons (140,000 barrels) of oil were released into the Kolva River when temporary&#13;
dikes built to contain the oil, failed during heavy fall rains. Serious damage was caused to&#13;
downstream communities, in particular, Kolva village, as a result of the releases. The Komi&#13;
Republic Emergency Situations Commission on October 10, 1994 declared an emergency in the&#13;
Kolva River area. Wholesale release of the remaining oil into the river system would create an&#13;
ecological disaster, threatening the livelihood of the downstream communities which depend on&#13;
the river system and the overall environment of the Pechora river system into which the Kolva&#13;
and Usa rivers flow.&#13;
2.          Immediate priority is completion of structures to contain the oil to allow orderly&#13;
removal and disposal of gross oil. While some containment structures have been built, they are&#13;
generally of poor design and construction and are inadequate to contain the oil when spring thaw&#13;
raises water levels in the Kolva and Usa rivers by up to 9 meters. Construction of significant&#13;
new structures is also required in the very limited time remaining before spring thaw.&#13;
3.          In addition to the significant containment and cleanup efforts required, further&#13;
serious spills are likely from the pipeline if urgent rehabilitation investments are not undertaken.&#13;
The pipeline has been seriously weakened by internal and external corrosion, largely as a result&#13;
of the presence of corrosive water produced with the oil. While most of the weakest "southern"&#13;
section of the pipeline, where the majority of spills occurred in 1994, has been replaced, the&#13;
"middle" section of the pipeline is of similar age and exposure to internal and external corrosion.&#13;
There are indications of escalating failures on this section. The alternative of shutting the&#13;
Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline down until remediation is complete is not feasible due to the economic&#13;
importance of the pipeline to the region. The pipeline, owned and operated by the regional oil&#13;
production company, Komineft, is the sole outlet to the national pipeline system for regional oil&#13;
production. The pipeline annually transports over $750 million of oil (at world market prices)&#13;
production, which directly and indirectly supports the employment of over 20,000 people. Oil&#13;
flows can also only be arrested for a brief duration, particularly in the winter, before the oil in&#13;
the pipeline, gathering lines, and oil wells begin to solidify, due to the paraffinic nature of the&#13;
oil. If complete solidification occurred, wells and pipelines could require abandonment or&#13;
expensive and risky measures to effect restart. Continuation of oil production and transport is&#13;
also important to provide fuel for the heating plant serving the Usinsk region.&#13;
B. Socio-Economic and Envirommental Impacts of the Oil Spill&#13;
4.           Overview.  Eight downstream river communities, with a total population of&#13;
approximately 7,000 people, would be most immediately affected by a large-scale oil release.&#13;
These communities prefer river water for part or all of their domestic water needs, as the deep&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
well water which is their main supply is contaminated with iron in concentrations ranging from&#13;
3.3 to 6.7 mg per liter. The river communities also pasture their cattle, which provide their&#13;
milk and meat, on the limited river flood plains. Flood plains contaminated with oil after the&#13;
spring floods would be unsuitable for grazing for at least one year.&#13;
5.           Large scale oil releases would severely damage the commercial and domestic&#13;
fisheries of the Usa and Pechora rivers which support an important Atlantic salmon fishery.&#13;
Particularly affected will be the spring spawners and bottom dwelling fish dependent on benthic&#13;
organisms for their food supply. On a lesser scale there would be loss of important wildlife&#13;
habitat especially small mammals and carnivores in the stream valleys and waterfowl and water&#13;
birds in upland waterbodies contaminated by the oil. In addition to the impact of oil releases,&#13;
salt water discharges to inland river and land systems cause substantial environmental impact&#13;
through loss of flora and fauna and contamination of surface and underground water supplies.&#13;
6.           Two of the oil spill sites straddle one of the major north-south migration corridors&#13;
for reindeer and may constitute a significant disruption to the herders. The spread of pollutants&#13;
from the site would further restrict migratory routes. In addition, the vulnerability of the herds&#13;
to pollution and loss of grazing habitat will present challenges for long-term range management&#13;
programs. The slow rate of vegetation growth in the region requires herders to shift their herds&#13;
constantly to prevent overgrazing.&#13;
7.           Climate of the Spill-Impacted Region. The Usinsk area is located in the Atlantic-&#13;
Arctic climatic zone, characterized by long cold winters, and cool rainy short summers.&#13;
Temperatures remain below 0O C for over 200 days. The average January temperature is -19o&#13;
C; the average July temperature is 15o C. Average annual precipitation is about 600 mm,&#13;
falling mostly in the autumn (October 68-74 mm). Snow cover is established by early October&#13;
and lasts till the end of May. Average snow on the ground in open areas is 45-75 cm and in&#13;
sheltered area 140-200 cm. Maximum snow accumulations occur in late March to early April.&#13;
Snowmelt data are presented in the table below.&#13;

[Disappearance of snow cover     30 Apr      26 May       26 June&#13;
8.          Quatemary sediments, formed during a complex series of marine and glacio-&#13;
marine transgressions and regressions, are exposed at the surface throughout the area. The&#13;
topography is flat to gently undulating. Higher elevation areas, composed of glacial sediments&#13;
of variable texture, are erosional remnants averaging 100-150 m asl. Slopes at elevations of 70-&#13;
110 m also show evidence of fluvial terraces and periglacial features. Lower elevation areas are&#13;
underlain by glacial-marine sediments of sandy and sandy loam texture and tend to be boggy&#13;
with extensive organic deposits. Permafrost (50-100 m thick) is semi-continuous in the northern&#13;
part of the area. It becomes sporadic in the central and southern areas (5-20 m in thickness),&#13;
where it is confined to bogs and peat plateau areas.&#13;

9.          River hydrology. The timing and volume of spring and fall flooding are critical&#13;
factors in the oil spill containment efforts. As the Kolva River rises during spring melt (by up&#13;
to 9 meters in some years) oil releases from the spill sites will occur without containment&#13;
structures. The water basin of the Kolva River covers about 18,100 km2, most of which lies in&#13;
the tundra zone. The Kolva floodplain varies from 500 m to 3 km in width. The broader flat&#13;
areas of the floodplain are swampy, with peat accumulations of up to 2 m. The width of the&#13;
river varies from 212-242 m and its depth varies from 1.4-2.0 m. Average flow rate is 0.5 m/s.&#13;
Many tributaries join the Kolva; their basin areas varying from 12.6 - 111 km2. The overall&#13;
density of the river system in the area is 0.3 km of channel per km2 of basin area. Marshes&#13;
cover about 27% of the area and vary in depth from 0.6 - 2 meters.&#13;
10.         Precipitation contributes about 70% of the Kolva's flow. The Kolva and its&#13;
tributaries are characterized by stable low water levels in the late winter, followed by highest&#13;
flows in the spring flood period. The spring flood usually begins between 10-15 May and ends&#13;
by about 10 July, but actual dates may vary by up to 30 days in particular years. Average&#13;
duration of the flood is about 60 days. Maximum flood levels occur on average between 20&#13;
May and 5 June. The table below gives ranges for these dates. Freeze-up begins on average&#13;
in the first 10 days of October with permanent ice cover forming in the second half of October.&#13;
Ice cover lasts on average 219 days. Minimum water levels occur between February and April.&#13;
Small tributaries freeze to the bottom in winter.&#13;

11.         Water Quality. The Komineft Ecological Department considers the Kolva River&#13;
and some of its tributaries to be the most polluted waterbodies of the Pechora River basin. The&#13;
Russian Federation Expert Committee noted that, as a result of the August-October 1994 spills,&#13;
tributaries to the Kolva River (Palnik-Shor, Bezymyanny, B. and M. Kenyu creeks, and the&#13;
Khatayakha and its tributaries) were extensively contaminated with oil following failure of&#13;
containment structures during high rains in September, when the first large oil release occurred.&#13;
12.         Field investigations carried out by Usinsk fishery scientists in October 15-20,&#13;
1994, indicated that the Kolva River was contaminated for 30-40 km over its whole width (100-&#13;
150 m) with oil. Riparian vegetation was covered with oil (up to 15 cm). The Usa River was&#13;
contaminated by oil products along a 21 km length to its whole width of 250-300 m. The&#13;
Pechora River also had 250 m of oil across its width stretching from Ust-Usa to Shelyabozh&#13;
villages, a distance of 40 km. The Russian Federation Expert Committee investigating the oil&#13;
spills noted that a GEOPOLIS aerial survey on October 3, did not detect any oil film on the&#13;
Kolva, Usa or Pechora rivers. The confirmed findings by river survey crews of very large&#13;
amounts of oil on those rivers on October 15-20 indicates a second massive washout of oil on,&#13;
or about, October 15, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
13.         Water samples taken on November 6, 1994 by Institute of Biology specialists on&#13;
the Kolva River "at the Bridge 1 Area" demonstrated oil products on the surface exceeded the&#13;
maximum permissible concentration (MPC) by 170 times, and samples taken at 2.5 m depth&#13;
exceeded MPC by 1000 times. Drift samples taken on November 6, 1994 under the ice below&#13;
the oil spill (220 m above the Bridge 1 crossing of the Kolva river at drill site 89) were found&#13;
to contain undissolved moving oil products amounting to 37.8 g/m3/h. Not surprisingly, chloride&#13;
ions in the waterbodies also increased, certainly as a result of the high levels of produced water&#13;
that must have accompanied the oil when the containment structures broke.  Chloride&#13;
concentrations in the Kolva rose to 25-105 mg/L, in Palnik-Shor Creek maximum concentrations&#13;
reached 929 mg/L, and in Bezymyanny Creek reached 1914 mg/L.&#13;
14.         The Usinsktermneft NGDU has established water quality monitoring sites at ten&#13;
locations along the Kolva River. Results from that sampling network indicated that during a&#13;
major spill occurrence period in August, chloride concentrations in tributary streams to the&#13;
Kolva reached values as high as 12,230 to 28,368 ppm.&#13;
15.         Socio-Economic Impacts. The affected rural Komi population in the region of&#13;
concern are resident in villages located on the Kolva, Usa, and Pechora rivers. These include,&#13;
in descending order within a radius of 120 km of the spill sites: Kolva Village, Ust-Usa,&#13;
Novikbozh, Schelyabozh, Zaharvan, Denisovka, Mutnyy Materik, and Vaskino.  These&#13;
communities are most directly affected by oil spills into the Kolva River system. These river&#13;
communities are largely based upon traditional economies which are dependent upon the&#13;
maintenance of water quality in the rivers for direct consumption and resource harvesting of the&#13;
fishery.&#13;
16.         In addition to the fishery, Komi reindeer herders maintain large herds which&#13;
follow annual migratory routes between winter pastures in the south and summer pastures in the&#13;
north of the region. This renewable resource has been augmented in recent years with the&#13;
addition of cattle for meat and dairy products in private holdings and in state farms. These&#13;
animals are pastured along the extensive riparian banklands of the Kolva, Usa and Pechora&#13;
rivers. Contamination of milk from hydrocarbons is a significant risk. In addition to impacts&#13;
on permanent pasture lands, a major reindeer migratory pathway was blocked by the spills. In&#13;
December 1994, there were unconfirmed reports that reindeer from the Ust-Usinsky collective&#13;
farm came into contact with the oil spills while being moved southward to their winter pastures.&#13;
The Usinsk City Director of Agriculture reported that as a result of the disturbances at the spill&#13;
sites, eight brigades were forced to move well east of the spill sites where they maintained the&#13;
herds on sub-optimal summer pastures during the winter. Eight other brigades of reindeer&#13;
herders proceeded south by extending the migratory corridor well west of the spill locations.&#13;
In April, the herders plan to follow the more westerly route again while proceeding north.&#13;
These alternatives were developed in conjunction with Komineft.&#13;
17.         The late 1994 oil spills severely impacted the community of Kolva Village and&#13;
the Kolva River. Survey results indicated that oil in the river just upstream of Kolva Village&#13;
in August and October 1994 exceeded both drinking water Maximum Permissible Concentrations&#13;
(MPCs) and fisheries MPC values. In October 1994, very large amounts of surface oil&#13;
contaminated the waters and riparian areas of Kolva Village. The Usinsk Committee on&#13;
Environmental Protection reported that a 5.12 ha area of river bank at Kolva Village was&#13;
contaminated with a total of 900 tons of oil. On the downstream portion of the Usa River in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Dibozh Island area, 2.5 ha of riverine area was contaminated by about 1,100 tons of oil. These&#13;
results indicate, for at least the fall of 1994, that local villages experienced severe contamination&#13;
from oil, and presumably associated saline production water. Although dilution effects in the&#13;
rivers would reduce the direct impacts to villages further downstream, the large volumes of oil&#13;
associated with these incidents would clearly diminish water quality throughout the region, most&#13;
specifically at Kolva Village. Traditionally villagers have used river water for domestic&#13;
purposes. As a result of these large oil spills into the Kolva River, reliable good quality&#13;
drinking water supplies from wells for downstream villages appear to be a necessity.&#13;
18.         Preliminary surveys carried out in February 1995, indicate that emergency&#13;
measures to mitigate the environmental impacts to the Kolva, Usa and Pechora rivers ranked as&#13;
the first and second priorities for downstream villages. Significantly, Kolva Village had as its&#13;
highest priority the replacement of feed for domestic livestock and reindeer due to loss of&#13;
grazing lands and feed shortages. Their second priority was potable water supply of good&#13;
quality.&#13;
19.         Fisheries. Anecdotal information received during community consultations&#13;
indicates that hydrocarbon contamination of traditional domestic fisheries has become a major&#13;
concern of Komi villagers. Preliminary analytical results from a November 6, 1994 Institute of&#13;
Biology field inspection reported a complete absence of benthic fauna on the Kolva River bottom&#13;
area contaminated by the oil spill. The researchers concluded that "the discovery of a complete&#13;
absence of benthos from bottom sediments allows for the determination for the ecological&#13;
condition of the waterways, at least in the aquatic area surveyed, as a critical one. "&#13;
20.         The researchers also carried out chemical and organic analyses of oil products in&#13;
muscle tissue of fish taken from the Pechora River in early December 1994 and in the Ust-&#13;
Tsilma area. The following analyses indicate extremely high oil contamination in fish:&#13;
Arctic Cisco       96 mg/kg (dry weight)&#13;
22 mg/kg (wet weight)&#13;
Cisco              73 mg/kg (dry weight)&#13;
16.9 mg/kg (wet weight)&#13;
21.          As a result of these and related data, the Joint Expert Committee concluded that&#13;
it was possible "to characterize the state of the waterway's ecological systems on the reviewed&#13;
part of the area as a critical one and to refer to this part as an emergency environmental&#13;
situation zone. " In short, the Kolva River and associated tributaries have been contaminated by&#13;
oil and produced saline water pollution events for at least a decade, but most severely as a result&#13;
of the 1994 events. This ongoing pollution has contributed to the loss of the commercial fishery&#13;
on the Kolva. For these and associated economic reasons, fish catches in Usinsk Raion have&#13;
declined from 68.52 tons in 1976 to only 8.4 tons in 1994. Komineft's ecological department&#13;
concluded that, as a result of the recent large oil spills, the Khatayakha left tributary and the Big&#13;
and Little Kenyu streams have lost their fish productivity, the Bezymyanny and Palnik-Shor&#13;
streams and the Khatayakha rivers have lost about 70-75% of their fish productivity, and the&#13;
Kolva fish fauna has been adversely affected. Without measures to contain the current spills&#13;
these problems will spread to the much larger Pechora River, threatening salmon and other&#13;
important fishery spawning grounds.&#13;

22.         Water Protection Zones. In May 1990, the Komi Republic Council of Ministers&#13;
passed a Resolution to establish boundaries of water protection zones along selected rivers, lakes&#13;
and water reservoirs to restrict commercial activities in the Komi Republic near waters that were&#13;
especially valuable for fisheries production. A list of these rivers is presented below.&#13;

Lyzha River         Pechora River                1000 m&#13;
23.         Nadpoimenny Environmental Reserve. On 1 March 1993, the Komi Republic&#13;
Council of Ministers established the 3000 ha Nadpoimenny environmental preserve in the&#13;
northwestern part of the Ust-Usinsky forestry zone (see Map 3, IBRD 26900). Within this&#13;
'zakaznik' protected territory, activities such as tillage, cattle feeding, construction, storage of&#13;
hazardous materials, use of mechanical vehicles, survey work or mineral resource mining,&#13;
including peat extraction, are prohibited. The preserve, protected by the Usinsk Forestry&#13;
Department, is designated for cranberry harvesting and hunting during permitted seasons.&#13;
Notably, the protected zone contains existing routes for the Komineft oil pipeline and associated&#13;
power transmission lines. Two of the oil and produced saline water spills which occurred in the&#13;
fall of 1994 lie within the boundaries of the zakaznik, but these were subsequently cleaned up&#13;
by Komineft. The estimates of contaminated surface areas (amounting to 8.7 ha) do not include&#13;
subsequent disturbances from line repair operations or cleanup activities.&#13;
24.         Air Quality. In the 1994 the Usinsk City Ecology Committee reported that 10,000&#13;
tons of spilled product are burned per annum in the Usinsk oilfield region. In 1992, at Usinsk-&#13;
Vozey, 12,000 m3 were spilled, most of which was burned. These figures indicate that&#13;
significant amounts of combusted hydrocarbon products are released into the atmosphere on an&#13;
annual basis, and ground observations have confirmed that burning is employed widely and&#13;
frequently on oil spills in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline.&#13;
25.         Evaporation of hydrocarbon light ends from spilled oil occurs upon contact with&#13;
the air. There is no air quality monitoring network in the region and no systematic data are&#13;
available on atmospheric hydrocarbon concentrations. Maximum permissible concentrations of&#13;
volatile hydrocarbons in the air are 5 mg/m3. Komineft's Department of Ecology has made&#13;
theoretical calculations of maximum concentrations at ground level at the spill sites, based on&#13;
a Russian GOST. These estimates exceed MPC by at least 2 orders of magnitude near the spill&#13;
areas. However, considering the uncertainty and lack of agreement on the total volume of oil&#13;
spilled, these calculations are not considered reliable at this time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26.          Hydrocarbon odors are pronounced in the vicinity of the spill sites, but have not&#13;
been reported from population centers. Given the large volumes of standing oil at the spill sites&#13;
and along the pipeline right-of-way, evaporative losses of hydrocarbon in the alea must have&#13;
been significant.&#13;
27.          Saline Waters, Oil Burning and Contaminated Soil Disposal. From an ecological&#13;
perspective, it is important to consider that as much as 30-35 % of the product contained in this&#13;
pipeline may be very saline production water. This produced water may have a profound impact&#13;
on ecological resources in the contaminated areas. Produced salt water of this quantity and&#13;
concentration will affect vegetation, fisheries, and wildlife throughout the region and may intrude&#13;
into local surface waters and aquifers. The treatment of these waters through containment&#13;
measures and by dispersion-dilution or flushing will be greatly complicated by the concomitant&#13;
presence of large quantities of oil and by lack of access to specific sites. Bioremediation of&#13;
contaminated oil sites will also be complicated by the presence of salty produced water. The&#13;
produced saltv water is separated at a treatment plant about 10 kilometers north of Usinsk and&#13;
returned by pipeline to the north for re-injection into the fields (although it seems that some&#13;
water is also injected into wells in Usinsk).  Leaks from the salt water pipeline are also&#13;
common.&#13;
28.         Impacts to lands associated with past burning of spilled hydrocarbons have not&#13;
been quantified. Due to inappropriate guidelines for oil burning, these activities have burned&#13;
nearby forest resources at many spill sites.&#13;
29.          Several disposal sites for oil-contaminated soil which occupy a total of 7.52 ha,&#13;
have been designated and permitted by the Usinsk administration, and contaminated soil is&#13;
currently being deposited at these locations.  Their suitability for short- and long-term&#13;
containment needs to be confirmed.&#13;
C. Pipeline Overview and Status&#13;
30.          Petroleum exploration activities in the Usinsk region date back to the mid-1960s.&#13;
The first oilfields were developed in the early 1970s, when commercial oil production&#13;
commenced at the Usinsk and Vozey fields. Production in the region peaked in the early 1980s&#13;
at some 19 million tons per annum (mta), but after that, a prolonged decline in production set&#13;
in -- which continues to this day -- caused variously by natural depletion, suboptimal exploitation&#13;
of reservoirs, and under-investment. This decline in production accelerated dramatically after&#13;
1991, shortly after the 200 millionth ton was produced (1990). The current production rate is&#13;
approximately 7 mta from several thousand wells owned by Komineft and foreign joint ventures.&#13;
31.          The 146 km oil trunkline, from Usinsk north to Kharyaga near the border with&#13;
Nenets is comprised of three separate segments (the Southern Section, the Middle Section, and&#13;
the Northern Section), constructed progressively from south to north as oil production progressed&#13;
northward. The route of the pipeline system is represented in Map 2. The capacity of the&#13;
trunkline system is approximately 220,000 barrels of fluid per day, although currently only&#13;
200,000 barrels of fluid per day (140,000 barrels of oil per day) are being transported. The&#13;
pipeline designs appear to have been produced in accordance with the applicable Russian codes&#13;
in effect at the time and appear to be generally satisfactory and complete with respect to most&#13;
engineering issues. Although this trunk pipeline was originally designed to carry 'sales quality'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
crude oil (containing less than 2 percent water), increasing volumes of water and gas have&#13;
entered the gathering lines, connector pipelines, and main trunk pipeline, so that the fluids now&#13;
contain 30-35 percent water. Considerable gas also appears to exist in solution in the crude oil,&#13;
with vapor pressures reported in the range of 6 kg/cm2.&#13;
32.         Due primarily to high chloride content, this produced water has led to substantial&#13;
damage to the both the feeder and main trunklines due to internal corrosion. In 1989, damage&#13;
due to internal corrosion of the trunkline was recognized as a significant problem, and Komineft&#13;
commenced experimentation with injection of various corrosion inhibitors into the pipeline.&#13;
Unfortunately these programs were never consistently implemented.  External corrosion,&#13;
particularly where high water tables existed, is also considered to be a problem. Under these&#13;
conditions, without aggressive mitigation measures, pipe life is generally less than 5 years.&#13;
33.         The most serious leaks from the Kharyaga-Usinsk trunkline have occurred in its&#13;
Southern Section built in 1975 and comprised of 720 mm diameter pipe. After a typical&#13;
progression of leaks had been documented in this section, starting in 1989, and including some&#13;
serious but poorly-documented leaks in 1992, a veritable explosion of major leaks occurred there&#13;
in August and September 1994. In Russia, this event is referred to by some as the "August&#13;
Avalanche". The pipeline system operators and designers have both concluded that these leaks&#13;
were caused by internal corrosion, probably due to erratic use of corrosion inhibitors over the&#13;
last several years. It is also conceivable that a combination of internal and external corrosion&#13;
may have contributed to this concentration of leak events.&#13;
34.         It is believed conservative, and consistent with other pipelines exposed to severe&#13;
internal and external corrosion, to consider the possibility that a number of pinhole leaks exist&#13;
in addition to the 'hole flaws' reported. However, it is considered probable, that some other&#13;
'precipitating event' occurred that contributed to the 'August Avalanche'.  One possible&#13;
precipitating event may have resulted from one or a series of temporary blockages of the pipeline&#13;
caused by the accumulation of waxy deposits within the 720 mm segment. This flow&#13;
impediment could have resulted in the build-up of pressure behind the blockage, which could&#13;
have caused a number of areas of broad deep internal metal loss to rupture, behind the&#13;
temporary blockage. It is noted that if another 'precipitating event' was to occur prior to the&#13;
replacement of the Middle Section of the pipeline, additional intensive pipeline leaks could&#13;
occur.&#13;
35.         Segments of the pipeline are seriously degraded and require immediate&#13;
replacement.  The oldest 58.6 km  section of the pipeline, the "southern" section, was&#13;
constructed in 1975 and is of 720 mm diameter. Approximately 47 km of this section has now&#13;
been replaced with a 530 mm diameter pipeline. The remaining 12 km of 720 mm pipe is due&#13;
for replacement shortly. The second or "middle" 49 km section was constructed in 1980 and&#13;
is 530 mm in diameter. This section of the pipeline is also seriously weakened by internal and&#13;
external corrosion. Replacement is only partially completed and should be finished on an urgent&#13;
basis. The newest 38 km "northern" section was built in 1986 and is 325 mm in diameter. This&#13;
section of the pipeline has not yet experienced the high rate of occurrence of leaks as the&#13;
southern and middle sections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36.          The "southern" section of the line has suffered the most. It has not only been in&#13;
service the longest but it has been exposed to the harshest environment. Because the diameter&#13;
of this, the oldest, section is the largest and the flow the slowest, water has tended to pool.&#13;
Hydraulic analysis indicates that laminar flow was probably present in this section. The water&#13;
would tend to separate out and sit on the bottom of the pipe. Unfortunately, pigging5 of this&#13;
section was not possible and nothing was done to remove this corrosive solution.&#13;
37.          The "middle" section has been exposed to similar elements. This section has not&#13;
been in service for as long a time and because of the smaller diameter not as much water will&#13;
have been allowed to interact with the bottom of the pipe. Although this section should not be&#13;
in as bad a condition as the older, "southern" section, recent increases in leaks would appear to&#13;
indicate that this section is rapidly approaching a critical state.&#13;
38.          The "northern" section has the smallest diameter and has the smallest oil flow as&#13;
the production fields tend to be downstream of this section. These fields are also more recent&#13;
and consequentially have less produced water. However, the oil in this section has the highest&#13;
temperature which contributes to corrosion. There is substantial permafrost in this area and, as&#13;
a result, a large portion of the pipeline is above ground supported by large diameter caissons or&#13;
suspension structures.&#13;
39.          The pipeline has also suffered from insufficient preventative maintenance and in&#13;
some instances from low quality construction. Initial construction of the line did not provide for&#13;
adequate coating, and cathodic protection has not been applied. The quality of welding may not&#13;
conform to standards, based on observations of recent construction. Proper construction&#13;
techniques were not always applied and consequential damage to the line is suspected. Changes&#13;
to pipe direction have been achieved through miter bends rather than bending the pipe in a&#13;
proper bending machine. Thus the existing pipe suffers from both internal and external corrosion&#13;
as well as mechanical defects.&#13;
40.          Much of the crude oil shipped is high sulfur, high paraffin, with correspondingly&#13;
high pour points. All grades of crude oils, ranging from 16 to 34 API, are commingled in the&#13;
pipeline. The pour point of the commingled crude appears to be approximately plus 15 degrees&#13;
C. That is, with air temperatures dropping as low as minus 40 degrees C, or more, and near-&#13;
surface soil temperatures of approximately 0 degrees C, production and transport of the oil can&#13;
only be arrested for a brief duration, particularly in the winter, before the oil in the wells,&#13;
gathering lines, connector lines, and main trunk pipeline begins to solidify. If complete&#13;
solidification occurred, wells and pipelines could require abandonment, overpressuring, or&#13;
expensive and risky measures to effect restart. Continuation of oil production is also important&#13;
for providing associated gas for use in the heating plants serving the Usinsk region. Therefore,&#13;
there has been a very strong operational incentive in recent years, as well as the immediate&#13;
financial one (gross revenue losses from pipeline outage would be approximately $2.0 million&#13;
per day), to maintain continuous oil flow in the system.&#13;
5/ Instruments run through pipelines to inspect internal integrity.&#13;

D. Komineft Spill Response and Pipeline Remediation Measures to Date&#13;
41.          Spill Response. Nine sites have been identified for cleanup activities by Komineft,&#13;
totaling about 70 hectares. Different Russian cleanup contractors have been working at each&#13;
site. Komineft's response strategy has been to contain the spilled oil at the spill sites through the&#13;
construction of perimeter dikes. So-called syphon dams were constructed to contain oil that had&#13;
migrated off-site into the main drainage streams. Cleanup activities with local contractors and&#13;
Komineft have been monitored and as of March 6 1995, Komineft state that 25% of the affected&#13;
area has been cleaned up. Unfortunately, criteria for cleanup have not been defined in the&#13;
reporting schedule. Each of the nine sites is briefly described below.&#13;
Site 1 - This southernmost spill area consists of the stream channels of Besimiyanni&#13;
Creek. It includes 8 hectares (ha) of oil. Two syphon dams were built to accommodate&#13;
a flow of 24 m3/sec, as per calculations of the Komi Hydrological Institute. About 50&#13;
tons of oil have been recovered to date. Approximately 150 tons of oil remain in the&#13;
blocked areas of the creek. Komineft considers this to be at high risk because of the&#13;
amount of oil in the active stream channel that could be readily released during spring&#13;
thaw.&#13;
Site 2 - This site consists of two oiled streams, totaling 3 ha. Three sections of these&#13;
streams were oiled. One has been cleaned to date. The other two are scheduled for&#13;
cleanup by April 1995.&#13;
Site 3 - This site is close to the Khatayakha River. Komineft has cleaned 5 of the&#13;
6 ha of oiled area. There is no apparent danger of future releases from this site.&#13;
Site 4 -This 12 ha site is considered by Komineft to be the most dangerous site&#13;
because of the proximity of large amounts of oil to a stream that drains directly&#13;
into the Kolva River. This is the site of the recent large spill on January 23,&#13;
1995. Russian surveyors estimated that there were 16,000 tons of oil present&#13;
before the most recent spill.&#13;
Site 5 - This is the largest site, totaling 30 ha. It is estimated that 90% of the&#13;
spilled oil is located at this site. Komineft has built dikes around the lower area,&#13;
but is planning to build dikes around the entire site with outer perimeter cut-off&#13;
ditches to redirect run-off water. Komineft is using drag lines to remove the oil&#13;
and snow surface layer which is being transferred to temporary pits adjacent to&#13;
the site where the oil is heated and processed for re-injection into the pipeline.&#13;
Recovery of oil is low because of the limited size of the facility and extremely&#13;
rudimentary nature of the equipment. Komineft estimated that 8,000 tons were&#13;
spilled at this site, of which it has recovered 1,000 tons to date. However, others&#13;
have estimated 68,000 tons at this site. If the oil in the 30 ha site is uniformly&#13;
O.meter thick (1 foot), the site would contain 81,000 tons.&#13;
Site 6 - This site totals about 3 ha and consists of an upland area adjacent to the&#13;
pipeline and oiled stream banks along Palnik-Shor Creek. Large amounts of oil&#13;
held behind containment structures built across the creek were released when the&#13;
structures failed during the fall 1994 flood. The containment structures are being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
re-built. Most of the oil on the upland area has been mechanically removed and&#13;
transported to a disposal pit.&#13;
Site 7 - This 2.5 ha site is located on Dibozh Island on the Usa River immediately&#13;
downstream of the confluence of the Usa and Kolva rivers. Activities to date&#13;
include construction of an access road.&#13;
Site 8 - Oil stranded on 5.1 ha of riparian shoreline near Kolva Village. Various oil&#13;
cleanup teams combined to remove the oil in October 1994. The oil is stabilized, but&#13;
more work is still needed to complete the cleanup of this site.&#13;
Site 9 - Oil was also stranded on 1 ha of Kolva River shoreline, about 8 km upstream&#13;
from Kolva Village. This site has been completely cleaned.&#13;
42.         The oil recovery strategy has been to collect free-floating oil for processing and&#13;
re-injection into the pipeline. Grossly contaminated materials have been mechanically removed&#13;
for temporary storage and/or disposal in landfills. Their strategy includes in-situ burning,&#13;
incineration of oily solids, bioremediation of oiled residues, and restoration of the sites. As of&#13;
March 1995, sites 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 were reported as having been cleaned or stabilized, whereas&#13;
sites 1, 4, 5,and 6 were identified as being of high priority for emergency stabilization and oil&#13;
removal prior to spring runoff. Komineft has reportedly not paid any of the local cleanup&#13;
contractors for the work done since July 1994. In spite of this, the local contractors have&#13;
continued to work on the sites, although at a reduced rate.&#13;
43.         Pipeline Remediation. Replacement of the existing pipeline with a new 530 mm&#13;
line has been planned and under construction since 1992. However, funding constraints have&#13;
severely limited progress.  Inadequate capital and operating budgets have also delayed&#13;
installation of new water removal facilities and the application of inhibitors to reduce the&#13;
corrosive impacts of the water. The initial phase of the replacement line was completed and tied&#13;
into the southern 720 mm portion of the system m late January 1995 on an accelerated basis due&#13;
to the oil spills. Approximately 12 km of the old and very badly corroded 720 mm is still in&#13;
service. Construction of the replacement of the middle section is about 60% complete, in&#13;
various stages of completion. The more southerly sections are the closest to completion, with&#13;
the first 26 km averaging 86% complete. The northern portion of this middle section is mostly&#13;
in the earlier stages of completion.&#13;
E. Requirement for Assistance&#13;
44.         Containment and cleanup efforts to date have been wholly inadequate to cope with&#13;
the emergency. The level of resources and technology applied will be unable to prevent the&#13;
ecological disaster which will result from large scale release of oil which has resulted from the&#13;
current and likely future spills. The Government of Russia and Komineft lack the ability to&#13;
quickly mobilize the needed resources to intensify the emergency operations and have requested&#13;
Bank assistance to help contain and cleanup the oil and to enact essential repairs to the pipeline&#13;
to ensure safe and reliable operation in the future. As with other Russian oil producers&#13;
Komineft's financial position has been severely constrained by low domestic oil prices, non-&#13;
payments by domestic customers and high taxes over the past three years. These problems have&#13;
been compounded by the loss of revenues and additional expenses resulting from the pipeline&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
failures and oil spills. Komineft is thus unable to effectively finance an adequate emergency&#13;
response.&#13;
II. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
A. Bank Response and Strategy&#13;
45.         The Komi oil spill situation was discussed with the Government during Mr.&#13;
Preston's visit to Russia in November 1994 and resulted in an offer of Bank assistance if Russian&#13;
technical and financial resources proved insufficient. Government indicated in late January 1995&#13;
that Komineft and the Government could not deal with this environmental disaster without&#13;
external assistance. Specifically: (i) they lacked the technical and financial resources to complete&#13;
the cleanup in time to prevent an ecological disaster; and, (ii) other donors have made it clear&#13;
that they will not assist Russia without Bank involvement. In response to a letter from Prime&#13;
Minister Chernomyrdin on January 23, 1995 the Bank agreed to assist Russia through an&#13;
Emergency Loan since an urgent response is vital, the environmental impact of the spill is&#13;
substantial and, without immediate action, the situation is likely to deteriorate, with additional&#13;
spills highly likely. The EBRD agreed to co-finance the project on a joint financing basis. The&#13;
proposed Project is justified on the basis of the severity of the present and potential&#13;
environmental disaster, as well as the need to continue oil production in a sustainable way in the&#13;
Komi region. In addition, this emergency operation should provide a vehicle for studying and&#13;
introducing oil spill mitigation measures in Russia's pipeline network.&#13;
46.         To ensure that Government was fully committed to the proposed Project, however,&#13;
the Bank indicated that it would proceed only if the Government and Komineft took steps to&#13;
engage an international management contractor capable of managing the cleanup and if the&#13;
Government established a special account and deposited US$12 million for initial payments to&#13;
this contractor that would be required while World Bank/EBRD loans were processed. These&#13;
steps have been undertaken by Komineft and the Government. The Bank organized technical&#13;
assistance to assist Komineft in project preparation through Canadian grant funding of&#13;
engineering and environmental studies and through USAID funding of an oil spill planning&#13;
expert.&#13;
III. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. Spill Containment and Cleanup Measures&#13;
47.         Spill containment and gross oil removal activities, as agreed between Komineft&#13;
and the International Management Contractor (IMC), are comprised of two distinct phases:&#13;
Phase I, with the objective of containing the largest volume of oil and protection of sensitive&#13;
resources; and Phase II, with the objective of removing the largest volume of mobile oil.&#13;
Thereafter work will focus on site remediation. The work to be conducted under each of these&#13;
phases is outlined below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
48.          Phase I: Spill Containment: will be conducted prior to and during spring thaw,&#13;
with the primary objective of containment and stabilization of the oil to minimize further off-site&#13;
release into the Kolva River and beyond into the Usa and Pechora Rivers. Activities will focus&#13;
on four known spill sites where the oil is most likely to be released during spring runoff. The&#13;
initial work is to include site assessment, construction of access roads, reinforcement of existing&#13;
dikes and construction of new dikes and other structures for containment of the oil and control&#13;
of water flow into and out of the diked areas, recovery and processing of oil where possible, and&#13;
pre-staging of equipment prior to thaw for recovery of oil that is released during flooding&#13;
conditions. Equipment will be pre-staged along the Kolva River as well. Once spring thaw&#13;
commences, the IMC will deploy containment booms and other structures designed to contain&#13;
and remove floating oil from watercourses to prevent oil release to the Kolva River and beyond.&#13;
On-water containment and recovery operations will be implemented as conditions permit; in&#13;
some cases it will be possible only to track oil slicks and notify downstream users. Although&#13;
containment of the oil is the primary focus, oil recovery will also be conducted as the oil is&#13;
released during snow melting and runoff.&#13;
49.          Sites 4 and 5 may require particular attention with respect to dike construction to&#13;
contain the spring runoff and direct it to the flow-through structures, as well as to keep the&#13;
Kolva River back-up waters from flooding into the contaminated spill areas. Data are being&#13;
analyzed to determine the appropriate design elevation for the crest of the perimeter dikes at Site&#13;
4 within the spring flood zone of the Kolva River. This dike has reportedly been constructed&#13;
with a sand core and a clay face on each side slope. In principle this structure appears to be&#13;
well positioned and designed; however, the quality of construction is unknown. Certainly, the&#13;
side slopes are relatively steep and appear to be poorly compacted.&#13;
50.          It should be noted that, in spite of the best efforts at containment, oil is expected&#13;
to be released into the Kolva River and downstream via the Usa into the Pechora River. There&#13;
is a high likelihood that flood waters, ice, and debris will cause the existing containment&#13;
structures at the known sites to fail. Furthermore, there may be new oil spills that went&#13;
undetected over the winter or will occur during Phase I work. The day-to-day priorities will&#13;
necessarily change frequently in response to changing physical conditions in the project area.&#13;
51.          To reduce the impacts of oil releases from the sites during flooding, booms will&#13;
be deployed at various points downstream of the sites to attempt containment and recovery.&#13;
Booms will be placed up- and downstream of earthen structures to divert floating oil to collection&#13;
areas. Booms will be positioned at the mouths of streams, where they enter the Kolva River or&#13;
downstream lakes. Booms will be staged for deployment in the Kolva River and at natural&#13;
collection points along the Usa and Pechora rivers to protect sensitive sites such as water intakes&#13;
and key floodplain pastures if significant amounts of oil reach these areas.&#13;
52.          As a further response measure, the Contractor will prepare stockpiles of additional&#13;
sand and construction equipment on hand at strategic locations so that critical structures can be&#13;
upgraded or repaired as required during breakup. Following the cessation of the spring runoff&#13;
(late July), all structures will be assessed as to their stability for subsequent containment (or as&#13;
to why they failed). Prior to freeze-up (snow cover), plans will be made for any dike&#13;
strengthening or construction of new structures required to contain the spring 1996 runoff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
53.          Phase II: Gross Oil Removal: will be conducted during the summer, with the&#13;
primary objective of removing as much potentially mobile oil as possible at the existing sites.&#13;
Thus, those sites with the greatest amount of mobile oil will be the highest priority. It is&#13;
important to note that one site is estimated to contain 90 percent of the total known amount of&#13;
oil spilled. Spring floods can peak as late as June; therefore, Phase II will include containment&#13;
and recovery of oil released to watercourses, including the Kolva River and beyond.&#13;
54.          Follow-up site assessments will be conducted to determine the distribution and&#13;
amount of oil remaining after spring floods. Cleanup efforts will attempt to remove oil stranded&#13;
along stream banks (by flushing) and behind containment structures during high water&#13;
conditions. Significant amounts of oiled peat, soils, and debris will remain after the completion&#13;
of gross oil removal at some sites, thus it may be necessary to leave some containment structures&#13;
in place for longer-term oil containment and treatment that is outside the scope of Phases I and&#13;
II. Before the IMC demobilizes under Phase II, selected containment structures will be identified&#13;
for stabilization.&#13;
55.          Cleanup and Disposal Methods. The methods proposed for use during Phases I&#13;
and II include the construction of civil works for oil containment, oil removal using excavators,&#13;
skimmers, pumps, and water-borne oil recovery equipment, re-injection of recovered oil into the&#13;
pipeline where possible, and treatment and disposal of oily wastes by landfill, landfarming, or&#13;
incineration. These are mostly conventional oil spill cleanup methods with the exception of the&#13;
scale of the civil works to be constructed and the extensive reliance on earthen structures for oil&#13;
containment. There is great concern that the earthen structures may fail during the extreme high&#13;
water and flow conditions of spring flood, thus their proper construction and maintenance is of&#13;
paramount importance. Specialists subcontracted to the IMC are being consulted on the issues&#13;
of water volumes, flood levels, and construction materials to improve the design and&#13;
performance of containment structures. Even under the best conditions, significant failure in the&#13;
containment of the oil is anticipated. Thus, plans include fall-back strategies for oil containment&#13;
and diversion downstream of these structures.&#13;
56.          Most of the recovered oil will be transported to treatment areas to be processed&#13;
for re-injection into the pipeline. Other oily wastes, including treatment sludges, oily sediments&#13;
and debris, and sorbent materials will be stored and processed for final disposal. Options for&#13;
disposal include landfill, solidification, and incineration. However, only landfills have been&#13;
approved for use at this stage.&#13;
57.          In-situ burning of oil is a non-conventional technique that is proposed for use&#13;
under specific applications. In-situ burning can be a highly effective method of oil removal, with&#13;
high removal rates for oil floating on the water surface. Permits for in-situ burning will be&#13;
obtained through an expedited environmental approval process. As part of the approval process,&#13;
a test burn will be conducted in April 1995 to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique and&#13;
develop guidelines for conditions of use and establishment of appropriate safety zones to protect&#13;
human health. Recently developed guidelines for use of in-situ burning in Alaska will be adapted&#13;
for use on this Project.&#13;
58.          For oil residues that cannot be reinjected into the pipeline and which cannot be&#13;
burned, it is proposed to dispose of them in secure landfills. Seven sites have been identified&#13;
and surveyed by Komineft and licenses have been issued by the local authority for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Since the contaminated materials contain large amounts of peat and organic matter which act as&#13;
natural physical binders, the amount of oil leaching from such material is reduced, but not&#13;
eliminated. It is still necessary to prevent leaching of oil from the disposal sites through the use&#13;
of impervious lining material such as clay or synthetic liners, which will not degrade on contact&#13;
with oil. Once filled with oil contaminated residues, the sites will be covered with plastic liners&#13;
and soil which will then be seeded. If necessary, provision will also be made for extraction and&#13;
collection of leachate from within the disposal area and cutoff trenches will be constructed to&#13;
divert any runoff water away from the disposal site. Monitoring wells will be constructed at&#13;
each of the land disposal sites to ensure that ground waters are not being contaminated.&#13;
59.          At the termination of Phase II activities, it is likely that significant amounts of oil&#13;
will remain at some sites. Cleanup of these oil residues will be needed to complete site&#13;
remediation and restoration. Complete removal of oil residues using conventional mechanical&#13;
techniques will be extremely costly and result in extensive physical disruption of habitats for&#13;
which restoration is both difficult and long-term. Thus, bioremediation, which is an acceleration&#13;
of the natural process of oil degradation by microbial activity, is one promising in-situ technique&#13;
that will be evaluated as a long-term strategy for Phase III oil cleanup and remediation.&#13;
Bioremediation was shown to be effective even during the short summer period at the Exxon&#13;
Valdez spill site in Alaska. Because full-scale bioremediation will not be attempted until 1996,&#13;
once gross oil removal has been completed, an applied research program will be conducted in&#13;
1995 to evaluate the effectiveness of bioremediation and develop operational guidelines for use&#13;
under these spill conditions. Revegetation techniques appropriate to subarctic conditions will also&#13;
be studied in 1995, for application in 1996 and 1997. This issue is discussed further below.&#13;
60.          Emergency Social Expenditures. The Kolva, Usa, and Pechora Rivers are&#13;
important as drinking water supplies and fishery habitat, and the floodplains are important&#13;
grazing areas. The environmental priority will be to keep oil out of the rivers. Thus,&#13;
containment and removal of oil from sites with the highest amount of mobile oil would provide&#13;
the greatest protection. In order to provide additional protection to the eight most vulnerable&#13;
downstream communities, water wells will be constructed and feed supplies for cows and sheep&#13;
will be transported close to the communities. Other priority social expenditures are being&#13;
identified through a continuing community consultation process.&#13;
61.          Contingency Sub-Projects and Phase III Activities. The current oil spill cleanup&#13;
plan and costs are focused on containment and recovery of oil from four priority sites, with&#13;
allowance for deployment of booms in the Kolva River in the event of off-site release of oil.&#13;
Additional funds may be needed for unexpected events such as a new leak of a large amount of&#13;
oil. Moreover, provision for activities planned for the Phase III cleanup of oil residues after the&#13;
gross oil removal of Phase II is completed is important. During Project preparation, additional&#13;
activities were identified, which may be necessary to protect sensitive natural resources and&#13;
mitigate environmental and social impacts.  Since such activities are considered likely,&#13;
substantial physical contingencies have been included in the Project cost. The five priority&#13;
activities that have been identified are outlined below.&#13;
(i)   Emergency Response Capability for Oil Releases Downstream of the Kolva River.&#13;
The current response plan requires the IMC to plan for, pre-stage equipment, and&#13;
respond to oil releases to the Kolva River only. In fact, it is likely that there will&#13;
also be major oil releases to the Usa and Pechora Rivers. Activities may include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
o     Monitoring for and collection of floating oil slicks in the Usa and Pechora&#13;
Rivers during spring and fall of 1995;&#13;
o     Protection of water intakes and riparian pastures threatened by oil slicks;&#13;
o     Removal of oil stranded along the river banks in priority areas; and&#13;
o     Mitigation of impacts directly resulting from actual oil contamination in&#13;
the affected communities (emergency water supplies, boat cleaning,&#13;
replacement of fouled fishing gear, etc.).&#13;
Labor and equipment need to be available for these activities, without having to&#13;
redeploy them from on-going work sites. Of these activities, monitoring of oil in&#13;
the Usa and Pechora Rivers, pre-staging/pre-deployment of booms to protect&#13;
water intakes, and planning for emergency water supplies will need to begin&#13;
during Phase I, as soon as the spring thaw begins. The other activities will only&#13;
be needed if large amounts of oil contaminate downstream areas.&#13;
(ii)   Emergency Response to and Cleanup of New Spills from the Pipeline. There is no&#13;
allowance in the current plan and budget for the IMC to provide equipment and&#13;
workers for emergency response in the event of a new leak from the pipeline.&#13;
The IMC could provide emergency response for new spills by redeploying&#13;
resources from existing work sites, but this would cause a delay in the projected&#13;
timeline to complete Phases I and II. Hence, it may be preferable to have the&#13;
trained, on-site teams provide emergency containment in the event of new spills,&#13;
with the ability to bring in new teams and equipment to conduct the necessary&#13;
cleanup. Subsequent to the major spills of the second and third quarters of 1994,&#13;
there have been numerous small spills and at least one new large spill in 1995.&#13;
Thus, it is likely that there will be more priority sites for stabilization and cleanup&#13;
beyond the four identified in the current scope of work. Additional resources will&#13;
be needed to conduct this work.&#13;
(iii)  Stabilization and Maintenance of Oil Containment Structures. At the completion&#13;
of Phase II cleanup, significant amounts of oil may remain at some sites. Because&#13;
of the size and degree of oiling at sites 4 and 5, it is thought that some of the&#13;
containment structures at these sites will be needed for longer-term  oil&#13;
containment and recovery in 1996. These structures may need to be stabilized to&#13;
survive fall flooding conditions, and any damage will have to be repaired to&#13;
prepare them for the spring 1996 runoff.&#13;
(iv)   Winter Maintenance and Security of Spill Response Equipment. Most of the&#13;
specialized oil spill response equipment used during Phases I and II will be&#13;
cleaned and turned over to Komineft at the completion of Phase II. This activity&#13;
will cover the costs of equipment storage, maintenance, and security over the&#13;
winter, to ensure that it is available and functional for use in spill response efforts&#13;
in 1996.&#13;
(v)   Phase III Cleanup and Remedial Activities. Current oil spill containment and&#13;
recovery efforts at the oil spill sites along the Komineft pipeline are designed to&#13;
remove gross concentrations of potentially mobile oil. At the termination of Phase&#13;
II activities, significant amounts of heavily oiled sediments may remain at some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
sites. Cleanup of these oil residues will be needed to complete site remediation&#13;
and restoration. Moreover, there may be a need to respond to releases of oil into&#13;
the Kolva River and further downstream during the 1996 spring floods. Phase III&#13;
cleanup and remediation activities may include:&#13;
o     Pre-staging and operation of equipment to contain and recover oil released&#13;
to the streams and rivers during spring floods in 1996;&#13;
o     Developing and implementing mechanical recovery efforts where needed&#13;
to remove heavily oiled residues;&#13;
o     Site preparation and implementation of additional cleanup strategies, such&#13;
as bioremediation;&#13;
o     Site restoration, such as re-grading, seeding, and fertilizing for&#13;
revegetation. It is estimated that 70 hectares will need some degree of&#13;
restoration activities in 1996 and in 1997; and&#13;
o     Technical support and monitoring of effects and effectiveness of cleanup&#13;
and restoration activities to be conducted during Phase III.&#13;
(vi)  Social Expenditures. Additional funding may be required for mitigating the&#13;
impacts of the oil spill on affected communities during Phase III.&#13;

by phase and activity, Table 2 summarizes expenditures by quarter over the Project life and&#13;
Table 3 highlights the key implementation tasks and dates. The containment and cleanup costs&#13;
include approximately US$ 5 million in expenditures already undertaken by Komineft which will&#13;

B. Pipeline Rehabilitation&#13;
63.          Notwithstanding the pipeline replacements which have been completed to date,&#13;
the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline remains in very poor condition, with significant risk of further&#13;
failures. Each day the pipeline continues to operate, the risk of spills increases. However, as&#13;
continued operation of the pipeline is essential to the economic survival of Komineft and its joint&#13;
venture partners, prompt solutions to reduce this risk are critical. The risk of failure can be&#13;
attributed to three potential causes: i) corrosion, ii) mechanical, and iii) operating practices risk.&#13;
Failure from corrosion is currently the most important risk to the system.  The risk of&#13;
mechanical failure of material or components is significantly less than the corrosion risk but is&#13;
still unacceptably high. Available facilities (or lack thereof) and ineffective operating procedures&#13;
also contribute to increasing the operating risk beyond acceptable limits.&#13;
64.          The proposed program of pipeline rehabilitation under the Project includes: (i)&#13;
immediate replacement of the remaining corroded portions of the middle and southern sections&#13;
of pipeline; (ii) repair or replacement of sections of pipe at risk of mechanical failure identified&#13;
through a program of integrity testing; (iii) investments to improve the operating regime, such&#13;
as water removal facilities, and installation of other equipment to improve operating and&#13;
maintenance practices and thereby reduce the risk of failure; and (iv) provision of emergency&#13;
response equipment.  Optimization studies of existing pipeline operations will also be&#13;
undertaken, as will strategic studies to determine future transport options.&#13;
65.          The Project as outlined should help establish a pipeline that has an acceptable and&#13;
maintainable level of risk. Because of the limited amount of data available to formulate this&#13;
Project it is expected that the scope of this program will change over time. The amount of funds&#13;
estimated to improve the mechanical condition of the line is subject to a high degree of variation.&#13;
As such, a higher than usual level of physical contingencies has been incorporated into the&#13;
Project plans.&#13;
66.          Emergency Replacement of Middle and Upper Southern Sections of the Pipeline.&#13;
Significant risk of another major spill can be removed by completing the replacement of the&#13;
remaining 12 km of the badly corroded 720 mm diameter line in the southern section of the&#13;
pipeline as quickly as possible. To accomplish this, the first 26 km of replacement of the middle&#13;
section must also be completed and tied-in to the existing line. This involves weighting and&#13;
backfilling 5 km of pipe and installing a short lateral. These critical works should be completed&#13;
prior to the spring thaw.&#13;
67.          Completion of replacement of the other parts of the 50 km middle section of the&#13;
pipeline is also important. Approximately 30 km of pipeline, in various stages of completion,&#13;
remains to be installed. Required works range from completion of pipe wrapping and trenching&#13;
in some sections to procurement of pipe and construction in other sections. Because of the&#13;
swampy conditions in the area much of the construction can only take place during the winter&#13;
when the ground is frozen. As of mid-March 1995, only 4 to 8 weeks before breakup remain&#13;
in the construction window. The only contractor that could possibly complete the critical sections&#13;
in that time frame is the local contractor that was constructing the middle section replacement&#13;
until funding ran out. The alternative is to wait until the next winter construction season (late&#13;
November 1995) which would mean a delay of approximately 7 months before completing&#13;
replacement of the middle section and remaining parts of the southern section of the pipeline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
The World Bank and EBRD have agreed that Komineft should engage the current contractor to&#13;
complete, on an emergency basis, the remaining work required to replace the middle section of&#13;
the pipeline and the last 12 km of the 720 mm southern section.&#13;
68.         This construction will be monitored and inspected by an international firm to&#13;
provide for the best quality construction possible under the conditions. In addition, the section&#13;
will be hydrotested to provide for some remediation of serious mechanical defects. The contract&#13;
with the local contractor will be structured to provide for rigorous quality and progress checks&#13;
with contract termination provided for if the targets are not met.&#13;
69.         Komineft has obtained bridge financing for the construction works until the Bank&#13;
loan is effective. This commercial bank loan will be secured by pledges of export sales.&#13;
70.         Pipeline Integrity Assessment, Remediation and Operational Improvements. After&#13;
completion of replacement of the middle section of the pipeline the highest risks of failure will&#13;
have been removed. However, the second element of unacceptably high risk on this line is&#13;
mechanical failure. The newly constructed southern and middle sections of the line and the&#13;
northern portion of the old line may have many mechanical defects that need to be removed or&#13;
repaired. Installation of the replacement sections of the line and the remediation of this line to&#13;
acceptable standards will provide a good base for improving the level of line integrity.&#13;
However, it is also important to undertake improvement in the operational facilities and practices&#13;
used on the line so that the situations which led to past failures are not repeated.&#13;
71.         The remediation to a lower and hopefully acceptable level of risk is possible using&#13;
currently available pipeline maintenance technology. A technical audit will be performed to&#13;
identify in detail the type and location of defects. This audit will be performed by an engineering&#13;
and inspection service firm. Both the internal and external condition of the line will be examined&#13;
by remote means to determine areas of weakness. Priority will be given to the worst defects, and&#13;
the ones posing the most threat will be examined and repaired. The proposed remediation work&#13;
will be contracted and will be completed to acceptable standards with the appropriate inspection&#13;
performed.&#13;
72.         Immediate operational improvements will be achieved through completion of two&#13;
partially constructed water removal facilities (KSP-74 and DNS-1) that are in various stages of&#13;
completion. Completion of these facilities will reduce the water content of the fluids transported&#13;
in the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline down to 6%. Corrosion inhibiting chemicals will also be&#13;
provided, if required. Because of the decrease in the water content, the amount of these&#13;
chemicals will be minimized. The project will provide facilities that will allow for pigging tools&#13;
to be introduced into the line which will allow for cleaning of the line and the introduction of&#13;
smart pigs to detect and monitor corrosion.&#13;
73.         Equipment required to conduct pipeline maintenance in a safe and efficient&#13;
manner, and which will provide for repairs to improve the quality of the line, will be provided.&#13;
An appropriate and effective pipeline maintenance program is the cornerstone in assessing and&#13;
maintaining the integrity of the pipeline. This equipment will include "stopple equipment" that&#13;
will allow for a continued but reduced flow of crude while maintenance is taking place. This will&#13;
solve the problem of maintenance being deferred because the line could not be shut down as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
result of pour point considerations. Additional equipment and supplies, suited to the terrain and&#13;
conditions, will be provided under the Project.&#13;
74.          To prevent failure due to overpressure of the line a pressure relief facility will be&#13;
provided. The exact configuration of this will be determined through hydraulic analysis. In the&#13;
course of the analysis appropriate methods for metering, control of the pipeline and leak&#13;
detection will be determined. This will improve pipeline control and provide information needed&#13;
to prevent pipeline failures and detect failures should they occur.&#13;
75.          Emergency Response Equipment. Provision of emergency response equipment and&#13;
training to allow Komineft to respond promptly and effectively to future emergencies is an&#13;
important component of the Project.&#13;
76.          Pipeline Operational and Strategic Studies. In addition to the pipeline investments,&#13;
the proposed Project provides for studies of current and future pipeline operations to maximize&#13;
the useful life of the existing pipeline, and for feasibility studies of future oil transport options,&#13;
including a possible new dry pipeline, in the region. The long term viability of the Kharyaga-&#13;
Usinsk pipeline is dependent not only on the quality of remediation investments undertaken, but&#13;
also on changing the operational practices of the pipeline and the gathering systems. It is&#13;
proposed that studies be undertaken to review the operating practices of the pipeline and&#13;
gathering lines in order to develop guidelines that will provide for the safe and efficient&#13;
operation of the line. Notwithstanding the proposed improvements of the existing line, Komineft&#13;
believes that development of a new dry pipeline will be required shortly, partly to accommodate&#13;
production from new field developments in the region. Studies are proposed to evaluate the&#13;
strategic options for future pipeline developments in the region and carry out associated&#13;
feasibility studies. The studies will require extensive participation on the part of Komineft&#13;
personnel and Komineft's local engineering institute.&#13;
77.          Costs and Implementation Schedule. Table 4 shows pipeline rehabilitation costs&#13;
by activity, Table 5 indicates expenditures by quarter over the Project life and Table 6&#13;
summarizes the key implementation tasks and dates. Costs for replacement of the middle and&#13;
southern sections of the pipeline include approximately US$ 10 million in expenditures already&#13;
undertaken by Komineft for emergency replacement of the southern section of the pipeline which&#13;
will not be financed by the World Bank or the EBRD.&#13;

C. Technical Assistance&#13;
78.          Environmental and Socio-Economic Management and Monitoring of the Clean- Up.&#13;
The Project will include technical assistance to strengthen and improve institutional capacity to&#13;
manage activities necessary to mitigate against the effects of the spilled oil. The technical&#13;
assistance has four major sub-components: (i) environmental and socio-economic advisors to&#13;
assist Komineft in spill management and undertaking related studies; (ii) implementation of&#13;
environmental monitoring by local institutes; (iii) studies to evaluate the technical and economic&#13;
feasibility of cleanup through bioremediation and revegetation; and (iv) public consultations,&#13;
information and participation. An international environmental consultant will be responsible to&#13;
manage and implement these sub-components the majority of which will be undertaken by&#13;
Russian specialists. The total cost of these services is estimated to be US$ 4 million. Each sub-&#13;
component is outlined below.&#13;
79.          Technical assistance will be provided to Komineft in order to ensure that the&#13;
critical phases of containment and cleanup operations are effectively carried out. Technical&#13;
advisors, both foreign and local, will work on site directly with the IMC and with Russian&#13;
institutes which will be sub-contracted to carry out specialized studies. The following six&#13;
technical  advisors  are  envisioned:  (i)  oil  spill  operations  advisor;  (ii)  civil&#13;
engineering/geotechnical advisor; (iii) socio-economic advisor; (iv) environmental monitoring&#13;
advisor; (v) bioremediation   and revegetation advisor; and (vi) environmental/project&#13;
management advisor. The general role for each of the advisors is to provide oversight&#13;
supervision on the effectiveness, goals, and quality of cleanup work planned by the IMC. They&#13;
will also train project scientists and assist in the design of scientific studies on environmental&#13;
monitoring of the effects of the spilled oil, which will be carried out by Russian scientific&#13;
institutes, with oversight monitoring being the responsibility of government environmental&#13;
agencies.&#13;
80.          As part of its assignment, the international environmental consultant will manage&#13;
and assist in the supervision and design of the various environmental monitoring activities. The&#13;
overall objective of monitoring will be to assure protection of human health and protection of&#13;
priority environmental resources, including resource harvesting and animal husbandry activities.&#13;
The field environmental monitoring will be carried out by scientific personnel, under multi-year&#13;
sub-contracts, either to scientific institutes or individuals for specific sub-activities.&#13;
81.          Specialized studies on the limitations, effectiveness and costs for bioremediation&#13;
and revegetation measures will be undertaken to develop low-cost cleanup technologies for the&#13;
subarctic conditions in the Komi region. The complete removal of all oil residues remaining after&#13;
gross oil cleanup, using conventional mechanical means, will be prohibitively expensive and will&#13;
likely disturb and denude large areas of fragile subarctic vegetation. Scientific institutes will be&#13;
commissioned to examine such limiting factors as cold temperatures, low oxygen content in&#13;
poorly drained soils, low nutrient availability, rates of oil degradation, effects of produced salt&#13;
water released from the pipeline, both in the international and Russian scientific literature and&#13;
through field plot testing.&#13;

ensure that consultative/participative programs are implemented for affected communities within&#13;
a 120 km radius of the spill zone. Local specialists and institutes have been and will be&#13;
commissioned to provide assistance in the active participation of downstream villages in defining&#13;
emergency needs and to ensure that timely information about the Project is provided.&#13;
83.           Contract Monitoring. Technical assistance has been provided to help Komineft&#13;
monitor the containment and cleanup and emergency pipeline replacement contracts. An&#13;
international inspection company has been appointed for these services. The total cost is&#13;
approximately US$ 0.3 million.&#13;
84.           Project Management. Technical assistance to strengthen Komineft's institutional&#13;
capacity in the areas of procurement, financial management and public relations will be&#13;
provided. The total cost is approximately US$ 1.9 million.&#13;

E. Environmental Aspects&#13;
85.         Environmental Monitoring. Environmental monitoring will commence at the very&#13;
beginning of the Project and continue until its end. The overall objective is to assure protection&#13;
of human health and protection of priority environmental resources, including resource&#13;
harvesting activities. Monitoring activities will focus on: (i) air quality in areas where spilled&#13;
oil may be burned; (ii) surface and groundwater quality; (iii) potable water sources in riverside&#13;
villages; (iv) the effects of spilled saline production water on vegetation; (v) the effects of the&#13;
spill sites on wildlife and aquatic life, and; (vi) monitoring for leaks from the pipeline.&#13;
86.          Pipeline Leak Detection. Until permanent leak detection is installed (estimated&#13;
to be mid-1997), interim pipeline leak detection will be carried out through twice-weekly aerial&#13;
surveillance. Environmental monitoring of the pipeline will also include surveillance for&#13;
excessive terrain disturbance of the right-of-way by the construction equipment.&#13;
87.          Other Environmental Mitigation included in the Project. The primary objective&#13;
of the Project is the mitigation of environmental and social impacts from the oil spills through&#13;
oil removal and site restoration. However, additional mitigation activities have been incorporated&#13;
into the Project and are summarized below:&#13;
(a)   Emergency social expenditures to mitigate immediate impacts to downstream&#13;
residents and herders, including provision of safe water supplies and forage for&#13;
livestock;&#13;
(b)   Contingency projects such as: (i) emergency response on the Usa and Pechora&#13;
rivers; (ii) emergency responses to new pipeline spills; and (iii) maintenance of&#13;
oil containment structures through the winters of 1995-96 and 1996-97;&#13;
(c)   Technical assistance for environmental and socio-economic management,&#13;
including: (i) provisions for technical advisors to Komineft to assist them in&#13;
developing environmental guidelines for implementation of Phase I and II cleanup&#13;
activities; (ii) technical assistance to carry out environmental monitoring that will&#13;
provide information on impacted resources so that sensitive resources are&#13;
adequately protected; and (iii) technical assistance in developing appropriate and&#13;
low-cost final cleanup and site restoration methods, based on operationally-&#13;
oriented and peer-reviewed scientific studies.&#13;
F. Public Consultation&#13;
88.         Involvement of the communities affected by the spills and local NGOs is an&#13;
important component of the consultation process. In February 1995 a preliminary consultation&#13;
process was initiated by Komineft with the assistance of a socio-economic consultant familiar&#13;
with such processes under similar conditions in Canada, financed by the Canadian Government.&#13;
Informal contacts with a major international environmental NGO were followed by local NGO&#13;
consultations and preliminary interviews with officials in Usinsk, Syktyvkar, and the downstream&#13;
affected villages of Kolva, Ust-Usa, Novibozh, Schelyabozh, Zaharvan, Denisovka, Mutnyy&#13;
Materik and Vaskino. The initial phases of the consultation process included discussion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
emergency needs, resulting from current and future impacts of oil spills and the cleanup&#13;
operations underway.&#13;
89.            The villagers were asked to rank their needs for emergency relief in areas of&#13;
health concerns, water supply, transportation services, availability of fuel, waste disposal and&#13;
sanitation, and feed and grazing for domestic livestock. These initial community rankings will&#13;
be used as a guide to establish priorities and protocols for immediate emergency services related&#13;
to the oil spills. The consultation process was augmented by a more detailed community-based&#13;
survey. The results from the survey will be incorporated into plans for mitigation of affected&#13;
villages. The results of the initial consultation are summarized in the following table, with 1&#13;
being the highest-ranked relief need, and 6 representing the least critical need.&#13;
90.            The continuing  consultation  process as planned  will include the regional&#13;
downstream communities, particularly those potentially affected by spills, and regional state&#13;
farms which have expressed concerns regarding reindeer husbandry. These latter concerns also&#13;
include maintenance and control of access to annual migratory routes, particularly those which&#13;
intersect hydrocarbon transportation corridors, the areas of large oil spills, and future areas&#13;
where cleanup activities may be carried out. In particular, specific mitigation measures should&#13;
include supplemental feeding (including the importation of suitable nutritional substitutes), and&#13;
enhanced animal husbandry and veterinary services. The result of these consultations will be&#13;
development of the program of social assistance to affected communities to be funded under the&#13;
Project as described in section A above.&#13;

Each village was asked to provide its prioritized list of requirements from the following:&#13;
o      health (community health care and medical supplies)&#13;
o      water (supply and quality of potable water)&#13;
o      transportation (access for supplies, health care, education, emergency services)&#13;
o      fuel (wood, gasoline, diesel, electrical and heating equipment)&#13;
o      waste disposal (sanitation)&#13;
o      feed (domestic livestock and reindeer, loss to grazing, feed shortages).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
91.          Consideration will be given to alternate approaches to compensation which provide&#13;
a more equitable settlement of disputes than the present system of pollution payments to regional&#13;
authorities and should encompass items such as emergency supplies, habitat enhancement and&#13;
protection, and possible related benefits through training to provide opportunities for enhanced&#13;
employment activities. The public consultation process will provide a focus for ongoing&#13;
assessment of human heath effects related to degraded supplies of water and foods from&#13;
sustainable sources.&#13;
92.          Local villagers could provide assistance to contractors and operators involved in&#13;
cleanup operations near the villages. As part of the social delivery mechanism, training of these&#13;
local residents could be carried out with a view to longer-term employment opportunities in&#13;
environmental mitigation, monitoring, and oil spill emergency response.&#13;
93.          Public information programs will be carried out to ensure that affected and&#13;
interested residents downstream of spills are informed on a frequent and timely basis about the&#13;
progress of the planned oil spill containment and cleanup activities. Many residents, particularly&#13;
at Usinsk, have expressed health concerns related to burning associated with cleanup measures.&#13;
Notification about burning and coordination with local officials, could serve to significantly&#13;
reduce or alleviate these concerns.&#13;
G. Regional and National Mitigation Efforts&#13;
94.          While not part of the Project, to address the broader issue of pipeline integrity&#13;
across Russia with an aim to identifying problems common to regional oil transport systems, it&#13;
is envisioned that the Ministry of Fuel and Power will coordinate an overview of the Komi and&#13;
north western regional pipeline system, based mainly on studies already undertaken/completed&#13;
and supplemented, as required, by targeted additional studies of specific issues. Factors essential&#13;
to the acceptance of and rapid completion of the study will be: (i) ownership of the study by&#13;
interested Russian parties (Transneft, regional authorities, federal ministries, etc.); (ii)&#13;
involvement of qualified Russian consultants; (iii) relevance to regional environmental issues;&#13;
(iv) avoidance of duplication of other ongoing or recently completed studies; and (v) concrete&#13;
recommendations for action.&#13;
H. Economic Justification, Risks and Mitigation Options&#13;
95.          The proposed Project consists of three main components: (i) spill containment,&#13;
cleanup, and assistance to affected peoples; (ii) Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline rehabilitation to&#13;
support its safe operations in the near term; (iii) identification, preparation and implementation&#13;
of other measures to prevent emergencies of this kind from recurring.&#13;
96.          In addition to helping minimize the ecological damage caused by the oil spills, the&#13;
benefits of the Project include operational improvements of the pipeline to ensure safe&#13;
uninterrupted operations in the future, training of the Komineft employees in emergency&#13;
response and establishment of a fully equipped and trained emergency response unit, greatly&#13;
reducing the risk of similar accidents, and improvement of the Komineft's environmental impact&#13;
monitoring capabilities. Project implementation will result in significant opportunities for local&#13;
contractors and suppliers. Without the Project, the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline would likely be&#13;
shut-down in the near term as failures escalated on the middle section of the pipeline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
97.         The net economic cost of shutting down the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline, at present&#13;
transporting over US$ 750 million worth of oil (in world market prices) per annum and&#13;
supporting the employment of over 20,000 people, is approximately US$ 400 million per annum.&#13;
Project costs are equivalent to the economic loss resulting from four months pipeline outage.&#13;
However, complete pipeline shutdown would also entail significant damage to oil wells and&#13;
gathering lines due to solidification of the oil. The economic cost of long term outage of the&#13;
pipeline and loss of production capability far exceeds the cost of the Project (including all&#13;
containment and clean-up costs). The Benefit-Cost Ratio is in excess of 15. From this base,&#13;
Project economic returns are very robust.&#13;
98.         Financial Evaluation. As described above the overall financial return to the&#13;
Project is large as the alternative may complete shut down of pipeline and oil production. The&#13;
direct financial return from the pipeline remediation component can be measured by the present&#13;
tariffs of US$ 3.75 per ton paid to Komineft by local private companies. Assuming the present&#13;
capacity utilization constant, the annual pipeline tariffs generation potential is in excess of US$&#13;
25 million. The financial return based on the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline revenue generation&#13;
potential, over the expected 10 years life of the replaced infrastructure, would be in excess of&#13;
30%, and the Project's net present value - in excess of $65 millon at a 15% discount rate. With&#13;
separation facilities completed pipeline life could be longer. This calculations assumes a&#13;
reasonable allowance to cover maintenance and operating expenditures, arrived at on the basis&#13;
of comparable international operations.&#13;
99.         Risks and Mitigating Measures. There is a significant risk of Komineft's inability&#13;
to complete the most urgent repairs on the middle section of the pipeline prior to the spring&#13;
thaw, which will greatly increase the possibility of new leaks occurring. This risk relates to the&#13;
lack of time left for the pipeline repairs in the 1994-1995 winter construction season. This risk&#13;
will be reduced by the use of a local contractor already mobilized on the site. Although the&#13;
capabilities of the pipeline contractor may not be fully adequate for the magnitude of the&#13;
emergency replacement program, further delays related to selection and mobilization of other&#13;
contractors will result in a greater risk of no pipeline replacement activities being undertaken&#13;
before the spring thaw. The construction risk will be managed through third party inspection&#13;
and monitoring services. However, there is still a risk that Komineft and its contractors' fail&#13;
to complete critical containment, clean-up and pipeline replacement works before the spring&#13;
thaw. Given the emergency and unprecedented nature of the Project, undertaken in an extremely&#13;
difficult environment, only partial success is expected. To mitigate the potential impact of the&#13;
deficiencies in the containment structures or pipeline replacement design and implementation,&#13;
emphasis is put on allowing sufficient contingency elements in the Project definition to enable&#13;
Komineft to respond immediately to any such failure.&#13;
100.        It should be noted that about three-quarters of the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline&#13;
capacity is used to transport Komineft oil. The value of such oil and, accordingly, the value of&#13;
the transportation services needed to bring it to the customers depends on the implementation&#13;
by the Russian authorities of policies stimulating oil production and reinvestment of the&#13;
generated revenue. If this does not occur in the short term, the actual financial return of the&#13;
Project could be much lower.&#13;
&#13;

IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Implementing Agency JSC Komineft&#13;
101.        The Implementing Agency for this project will be the Open Type Joint Stock&#13;
Company Komineft, controlled by the KomiTEK holding company.&#13;
JSC Komineft: Legal Status and Ownership.&#13;
102.        The Open-type (Public) Joint Stock Company Komineft (JSC Komineft) was&#13;
established on April 21, 1993 on the basis of a decision of the Property Management Committee&#13;
of the Komi Republic in accordance with Decree #1403 of the President of the Russian&#13;
Federation (On Privatization and Transformation into Joint Stock Companies of State&#13;
Enterprises, Production and Research Associations of Oil, Oil Refining and Petroleum Product&#13;
Supply Sectors, November 17, 1992). Subsequently, on May 6, 1993, JSC Komineft was&#13;
registered by the Ukhta city administration (registration # 451p). The main activities of JSC&#13;
Komineft are determined by its charter and registration certificate as oil and gas production and&#13;
processing, and exploration and development of oil fields. JSC Komineft holds oil and associated&#13;
gas exploration and production licenses for most oil fields of the Timan-Pechora petroliferous&#13;
province which includes territories of the Komi Republic and neighboring Nenets Autonomous&#13;
Okrug (Arkhangelsk Oblast).&#13;
103.        Initially, 38%  of shares were transferred, in equal proportions, to the state&#13;
property funds of the Russian Federation and Komi Republic, 40% were distributed and sold to&#13;
JSC Komineft employees and management, and the remaining 22% were allocated for sale at&#13;
voucher auctions and investment tenders. Subsequently, the state-owned block of Komineft&#13;
shares has been transferred to the JSC Oil Company KomiTEK, established on June 27, 1994&#13;
by a decision of the governments of the Russian Federation and the Komi Republic. As of March&#13;
15, 1995, Komineft had 52,000 shareholders (including natural and juridical persons), with the&#13;
Russian Federation and Komi Republic each owning 19% of the stock issue.&#13;
104.        Under the Komineft charter, KomiTEK (or another holder of over 25% of the&#13;
voting shares) is vested with the right to veto any decision of the general meetings of the&#13;
shareholders related to changes in the charter, capital, or mergers and acquisitions. In addition,&#13;
Komineft cannot enter into any agreement, the value of which is in excess of 25% of the&#13;
Komineft capital, without the approval of more than three-quarters of its shareholders. At&#13;
present, KomiTEK also has an effective right to appoint Komineft directors, including the&#13;
Director General.&#13;
105.        The JSC Komineft includes 2 affiliate joint stock companies, an affiliate&#13;
enterprise, and more than 40 structural units. Among the latter are 5 oil and gas production&#13;
directorates (Russian abbreviation - NGDUs), 2 drilling directorates, transportation units,&#13;
research and design institutes, agricultural enterprises, etc. The management structure of the JSC&#13;
Komineft is largely similar to that of its legal predecessor, Producing Association Komineft, and&#13;
as well to those of other Russian oil companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
106.        The Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline is operated and maintained on a contractual basis&#13;
by the JSC Etan, a Komineft affiliate company, and is a part of the assets of the NGDU&#13;
Arkhangelskneftegas, wholly owned by Komineft. Produced fluid is separated and processed to&#13;
sale quality oil by the affiliate JSC, Comprehensive Oil Preparation.&#13;
JSC Komineft: Operations and Financial Status&#13;
107.        Location. Until 1991, Komineft was the only oil producing enterprise in Komi&#13;
Republic and a monopoly holder of the rights for development of the Republic's oil reserves.&#13;
It was also active in development of the oil resources of the Arkhangelsk region and planned to&#13;
proceed with the production of the reservoirs on the territory of the adjacent Nenets Autonomous&#13;
Region. At present, practically all of Komineft's operations are in the Komi republic, while it&#13;
still holds the rights for development of 20.5 % of the Nenets Autonomous Region oil reserves.&#13;
In the Komi Republic, Komineft together with its affiliated companies holds 71.2% of the oil&#13;
reserves.&#13;
108.        Reserves.  Since 1991, Komineft has actively pursued a strategy of joint&#13;
development of its fields together with international and Russian investors. By the end of 1994,&#13;
48.1 % of the formerly controlled Komineft oil reserves were transferred to such joint ventures.&#13;
The most significant of these are KomiArcticOil along with Gulf Canada and British Gas and&#13;
Nobel Oil along with Glencore International. The estimated remaining volume of proven and&#13;
probable reserves being developed by Komineft is approximately 348 million barrels.&#13;
109.        Production. After achieving peak oil production of 380,000 bpd (19 million tons&#13;
per annum) in 1984-1985 Komineft's production has steadily declined. This process accelerated&#13;
during the years 1992-1994. Over these three years Komineft's oil production declined by 47%&#13;
and a further 13% decline is expected in 1995. Since 1992, due to the lack of financial&#13;
resources Komineft has not brought any new oil fields into production (which is vital for the&#13;
maintenance of output).&#13;
110.        Financial Position. The summary information onKomineft's financial performance&#13;
in 1992-1994 outlined below, based on unaudited financial statements, shows the deterioration&#13;
of the company's financial situation which has contributed to and resulted from the current&#13;
problems.&#13;

Note: The value of the Komineft assets has never been subject to an independent evaluation. The&#13;
apparent increases in the US$ value of the company's assets and share capital is primarily due to&#13;
regular revaluation of assets pursuant to governmental orders. No allowance has been made to take&#13;
into account inadequate correlation between Russian inflation and US$/Rb exchange rate.&#13;

* in total 23 taxes were applied to Komineft in 1994.&#13;
111.          Although Komineft is a relatively high cost producer compared to West Siberian&#13;
oil companies, the main reason for Komineft's poor performance is the continuing policies of&#13;
the Russian government with respect oil prices and taxation and to the problem of non-payments,&#13;
primarily from the state controlled industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
112.        During the course of 1994, Komineft was exempt from payment of export tariffs&#13;
and was allowed to export approximately 14% of its production.  Following the recent&#13;
liberalization of the crude oil export market, Komineft is expected to increase its exports up to&#13;
25% of its production but will have to pay full export tariffs. Overall, Komineft's financial&#13;
situation should improve with expected additional exports. Preliminary results of the first&#13;
quarter of 1995 show a positive income.&#13;
113.        Future Prospects. A sharp increase of the Russian internal oil prices is unlikely&#13;
in the immediate term due to continued problems with demand and payments from otherwise&#13;
insolvent enterprises and from government institutions. In the short term reallocation of profits&#13;
realized within the integrated oil company KomiTEK may be required to support Komineft.&#13;
114.        Improvement of Komineft's financial performance in the medium term will depend&#13;
on the overall development of the Russian economy, including improvement of the budgetary&#13;
planning and tax collection procedures leading to a more equal distribution of the tax burden&#13;
throughout the economy and allowing oil producers to begin reinvestment to realize the potential&#13;
of the remaining reserves.&#13;
115.         During Negotiations, Komineft agreed to the following financial performance&#13;
measures: (i) maintenance of satisfactory levels of working capital including a current ratio of&#13;
not less than 1.25 with account receivables at no greater than 60 days sales and accounts payable&#13;
at not greater than 75 days cash expenses; and (ii) cash flow adequate to ensure a debt service&#13;
ratio of not less than 1.5. In addition, Komineft will establish a pipeline reserve fund to finance&#13;
maintenance on the pipeline after the project is completed which will be formalized in the&#13;
Subsidiary Loan Agreement.&#13;
B. Management Structure for Project Imnplementation&#13;
116.        Komineft has established a senior project management team (PIU) to direct,&#13;
review, and approve the activities conducted by the IMC and its sub-contractors and the pipeline&#13;
contractors. A core team will be committed to the project for its duration. The overall project&#13;
manager and two deputy project managers, have been appointed, one responsible for cleanup&#13;
activities, the other for pipeline activities. The demands on the PIU will initially be extreme,&#13;
requiring the team to spend much time making sure that the Project is progressing successfully.&#13;
The PIU will have both the authority and technical expertise to direct the Project and make&#13;
policy decisions. A second level of Komineft staff will be assigned to the various functional&#13;
groups of planning, operations, logistics, and finance, to direct the day-to-day activities of the&#13;
project. Team members will have clearly defined roles and responsibilities and clear areas of&#13;
authority. Details of PIU functions and organization are provided in Attachment 1 to this&#13;
Technical Annex. Technical assistance will also be provided under the Project to support&#13;
Komineft in the areas of procurement, contract and financial management. Agreement was&#13;
reached during Negotiations that Komineft will maintain adequate staffing of the PIU,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
C. Government Management Structure and Permit Clearance Procedures&#13;
117.        In order to facilitate rapid Project implementation a high level Emergency Oil&#13;
Spill Recovery and Mitigation Project Working Group has been established by the Russian&#13;
Government to resolve legal, administrative, fiscal and general implementation issues and&#13;
expedite necessary clearances. The Working Group is chaired by the Minister of Fuel and&#13;
Energy and includes high level representation from the Russian Federation, the Komi Republic&#13;
and Komineft. In addition to Komineft this group will be the key focal point for the Bank's&#13;
supervision of the Project.&#13;
118.        At the local level the Usinsk City Land Use Commission acts as a 'clearing house'&#13;
for local permits. For construction of facilities, such as disposal pits for contaminated soils or&#13;
temporary containment dikes in the Ust-Usinsky region, applications are vetted by a number of&#13;
local committees including: the forestry committee; state farms, where applicable; the city&#13;
environmental committee; the city architect; and the land use committee. Once preliminary&#13;
design documents have been produced, the land use commission initiates the reviews and submits&#13;
a documentation package to Syktyvkar. A May 23, 1990 Resolution of the Komi Republic&#13;
Council of Ministers allows for the establishment of boundaries of water protection zones and&#13;
riparian strips along rivers, lakes and water reservoirs in the Komi Republic. Authorizations&#13;
for activities in those zones must be sought from the local branches of the Komi State&#13;
Environmental Committee. Water protection zones along the Kolva River are 1 km in width and&#13;
for the Khatayakha tributary 0.5 km in width.&#13;
119.        The Government of the Komi Republic, recognizing the crucial importance in&#13;
emergency operations of prompt issuance of necessary permits and clearances, has approved and&#13;
issued a special resolution (provided as Attachment 2 to this Annex) authorizing the Deputy&#13;
Head of the Republic, Chairman of the Komi Standing Commission for Emergency Situations,&#13;
to provide Komineft, the IMC, and its subcontractors, all required permits, clearances, and&#13;
licenses under streamlined procedures through his local representative.&#13;
D. Financing Plan and Co-Financing&#13;
120.         The financing plan for the Project is outlined in Table 11 and includes an IBRD&#13;
loan of US$ 99 million and an EBRD loan of US$ 25 million. Komineft will be responsible for&#13;
payment of all taxes and levies related to the procurement of equipment and services for the&#13;
Project implementation. In accordance with Russian government resolutions providing for a tax-&#13;
exempt status of sovereign-guaranteed loans obtained from international financial institutions,&#13;
these expenses may be waived or deferred.&#13;

Total                   $140.0              100.0%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
121.         The IBRD and EBRD will jointly finance, in the ratio of 80/20 the following&#13;
contracts under the Project: (i) containment and cleanup; (ii) emergency pipeline replacement;&#13;
and (iii) contingencies relating to these parts of the Project. EBRD will finance the pipeline&#13;
studies and the World Bank will finance the remaining parts of the Project. The agreement of&#13;
the Banks as to the financing arrangements was based on the objective of minimizing potential&#13;
delays caused by different procurement procedures and minimizing the need for contract review&#13;
by both institutions.&#13;
122.        The Bank and EBRD will sign a co-lenders agreement covering disbursement&#13;
procedures, information sharing and remedies in the event of default.&#13;
123.        The Bank and EBRD loans will be made to the Russian Federation and on-lent&#13;
to Komineft under separate Subsidiary Loan Agreements. Completion of Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreements acceptable to the World Bank and the EBRD are a condition of Effectiveness for&#13;
each Loan. The term of the on-lending for the World Bank loan will be 15 years including 5&#13;
years grace with the interest rate equal to the Bank rate plus 75 basis points. Komineft will&#13;
assume the foreign exchange risk of the Loan while the Subsidiary Loan Agreement is in effect.&#13;
The EBRD expects its loan of 15 years including 3 years grace to the Russian Federation to be&#13;
on-lent at 14 years including 3 years grace.&#13;
E. Procurement&#13;
124.        The work to be performed on the Project will be carried out under six major&#13;
contracts: (i) a management contract for oil spill containment and clean-up (US $45 million); (ii)&#13;
an emergency pipeline replacement completion contract (US $16.0 million); (iii) an&#13;
environmental monitoring and management contract (US $4.0 million); (iv) an independent&#13;
monitoring contract to check compliance by the management and emergency pipeline contractors&#13;
with the technical and commercial conditions of their contracts (US $0.3 million); (v) a pipeline&#13;
inspection and testing contract (US $3.2 million); and (vi) a pipeline and facilities remediation&#13;
contract (US$ 16.7 million). Contracts (i) and (ii) have been procured using the Bank's&#13;
Procurement and Use of Consultants Guidelines and will be jointly co-financed with EBRD in&#13;
the ratio of 80/20. Contracts (iii), (v) and (vi) will be entirely financed by the Bank and contract&#13;
(iv) entirely by the EBRD on a parallel co-financing basis with each Bank using its own&#13;
procurement rules. The EBRD will also finance a future contract for pipeline operations and&#13;
strategy studies.&#13;
125.        Given the emergency nature of the Project, contracts (i) and (ii) have been&#13;
awarded on a sole-source basis to the firms most capable of meeting the essential criteria for&#13;
successful performance of those contracts. Contracts (iii) and (v) will be awarded using the&#13;
Bank's competitive consultant selection procedures as outlined in the Bank's Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants.  Contract (iv) was awarded using the EBRD's consultant selection&#13;
procedures. Contract (vi) will be procured using International Competitive Bidding (ICB),&#13;
preceded by prequalification. Goods, works and services relating to the improvement of KMN's&#13;
emergency spill response capacity (US $5.3 million) and social assistance sub-projects (US $2&#13;
million) will be procured using International Competitive Bidding (ICB), Limited International&#13;
Bidding (LIB), international or national shopping or direct contracting procedures, or the&#13;
selection procedures contained in the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, depending&#13;
on the value of the potential contract and the nature of the item to be procured. Goods contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
valued at US $200,000 or more will be procured using ICB procedures with eligible Russian&#13;
manufacturers entitled to the Bank's domestic preference for goods in the evaluation of bids.&#13;
126.        KMN, in cooperation with the Bank and EBRD, has already undertaken a large&#13;
amount of advance procurement and will have entered into two key contracts described above&#13;
by the time the loan is presented to the Board. Retroactive financing of up to $20 million will&#13;
be permitted under the Loan Agreement, although it is likely that only US $18 million will be&#13;
needed for contracts (i) and (ii) described above. The maximum level of retroactive financing&#13;
is 20.2% of the Loan amount, which is not materially above the amount permitted under Bank&#13;
guidelines for Emergency Recovery Assistance in OD 8.50. The Bank has already reviewed, or&#13;
will review prior to award, the procedures and documents used for all the key contracts jointly&#13;
cofinanced under the Project. It has also reviewed the Terms of Reference for the independent&#13;
monitor's contract, the environmental monitoring and management contract, and the testing and&#13;
inspection services contract. Future contracts for goods and works valued at US $200,000 or&#13;
more and all contracts entered into using LIB and direct contracting procedures will be subject&#13;
to prior Bank review. Consultant contracts of a critical nature and those valued at US $50,000&#13;
or more will also be subject to prior Bank review. Further details are provided in Attachment&#13;
3 to this Annex.&#13;
F. Disbursements&#13;
127.        The Disbursement Arrangements for the Project are summarized in Schedule B&#13;
of the Memorandum of the President.&#13;
G. Accounts and Audits&#13;
128.        Komineft has appointed an international accounting firm to provide audit services&#13;
for 1994 which is expected to continue in this capacity in 1995. During Negotiations, Komineft&#13;
agreed to furnish to the Bank:&#13;
(a)   Actual and forecast financial statements, within three months of the end of each&#13;
fiscal year;&#13;
(b)   Audited project accounts beginning with the account for fiscal year 1995, within&#13;
six months of the end of each fiscal year; and&#13;
(c)   Audited financial statements of Komineft (including a qualified restatement in&#13;
accordance with IAS if required) showing its performance and position beginning&#13;
with fiscal year 1995, within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
H. Supervision Plan&#13;
129.        Supervision of the Project will require intensive Bank staff involvement for the&#13;
first six months of implementation in order to provide Komineft with support during&#13;
implementation of the key cleanup and emergency pipeline remediation activities. A formal&#13;
review of the Project is planned for the fall of 1995 after completion of Phase I of the&#13;
containment operations and the emergency pipeline replacement works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND ACTIONS&#13;
130.        Agreements. To facilitate implementation of the Project the Head of the Komi&#13;
Republic has signed two decrees to accelerate project implementation: (i) permits, licenses and&#13;
cleanup methods will be approved by one government official on an emergency basis; and (ii)&#13;
the $75 million in fines imposed on Komineft by the local environmental authority for spills,&#13;
which accrue to the Komi Republic will be used by Komineft for Project implementation.&#13;
131.        During negotiations, Komineft agreed to the following future actions with respect&#13;
to Project implementation: (i) maintenance of a Project Implementation Unit with acceptable&#13;
management and specialists; (ii) provision of effective and timely social assistance to affected&#13;
communities; (iii) maintenance of a 1.5 debt service ratio; (iv) maintenance of acceptable levels&#13;
of working capital; (v) submission of audited Project accounts and financial statements by an&#13;
auditor acceptable to the Bank; and (vi) preparation of a project completion report.&#13;
132.        With respect to timely and effective assistance to affected communities Komineft&#13;
agreed that if the needs for assistance exceed Komineft's ability to mobilize resources Komineft&#13;
will utilize contingency funds in the Project under the IMC.&#13;
133.        Actions. Conditions of Loan Effectiveness include: (i) signature of a subsidiary&#13;
loan agreement between the Russian Federation and Komineft; (ii) receipt of legal opinions in&#13;
respect to the Loan Agreement, Project Agreement and the subsidiary loan agreement; and (iii)&#13;
effectiveness of the EBRD loan.&#13;

RussL4N FEDERATION&#13;
EMERGENCY OIL SPILL RECOVERY AND MITIGATION PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEmENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Project Organization&#13;
1.                Because of the urgency of Phase I of the cleanup, it will be conducted in&#13;
an emergency mode, and Komineft management must be prepared to review and approve the&#13;
recommendations of the IMC on a very quick turnaround. Phase II activities will be conducted&#13;
in a manner more consistent with normal project management, with more time allowed for&#13;
planning, review, and decision-making.&#13;
2.          The general PIU organization is shown in Figure 1. Similar organizations have&#13;
been employed in other emergency spill operations around the world. Komineft can become as&#13;
mivolved in managing the day-to-day operations of the cleanup as it wants, by having Komineft&#13;
representatives on all levels of management. In the organization plan in Figure 1, Komineft staff&#13;
are the Team Leaders (TL) for each primary functional group in the organization.&#13;
B. General Management Philosophy&#13;
3.         In contracts such as this, it is normal and important that the contractor be given&#13;
maximum latitude to make day-to-day decisions without having to seek review and approval.&#13;
Under these conditions it is important that Komineft establish a strong monitoring capacity and&#13;
work approval procedures which provide clear guidance up front. Thus, the general work plan&#13;
should be approved, and the IMC should be required only to seek review and approvals for&#13;
deviations from the approved procedures.&#13;

C. The Project Organization and Responsibilities&#13;
4.             The key activities to be conducted by selected parts of the response organization&#13;
are briefly outlined below.&#13;
5.             The Komineft Senior Project Management Team  will meet daily with the&#13;
Contractor Spill Management Team to receive a status report on the previous day's effort and&#13;
review, approve the next day's work plans, and resolve problems. They will be responsible for:&#13;
o      Approving  the general cleanup  strategies  and  priorities proposed  by  the&#13;
Contractor;&#13;
o      Approving site-specific work orders;&#13;
o      Reviewing daily work priorities;&#13;
o      Monitoring the effectiveness and costs of the cleanup;&#13;
o      Approving the cleanup costs;&#13;
o      Solving problems that the IMC cannot resolve on its own, such as those related&#13;
to Govermment clearances;&#13;
o      Facilitating access to and contracting with local resources;&#13;
o      Responding to requests for information from the public;&#13;
o      Enforcing cleanup standards; and&#13;
o      Overall project administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
6.          Public Relations consists of two different groups: a Public Affairs group and a&#13;
Community Relations group. The Public Affairs group is primarily responsible for generating&#13;
press releases and responding to inquires from the media. Its focus is national and international&#13;
in scope. In contrast, the Community Relations group focuses on the local community and how&#13;
the spills and mitigation components affect them. They will meet with the local and downstream&#13;
communities to explain the project, listen to the concerns of local citizens and businesses, and&#13;
make sure that these concerns are addressed.&#13;
7.           The Planning Team will include technical specialists in cleanup methods, site&#13;
surveys, regulatory issues, and environmental concerns. Field teams conduct the detailed site&#13;
surveys upon which the Operations Team develops site-specific work plans and will be&#13;
responsible for:&#13;
o     Generating general guidelines for protection of the environment and human health&#13;
in the region during cleanup (essentially "best management practices" for each&#13;
approved cleanup method being used);&#13;
o     Surveying each site and preparing pre-cleanup site assessment reports including:&#13;
maps/descriptions of the oil at each site, site-specific recommendations for&#13;
cleanup methods to be used, environmental restrictions and guidelines at each&#13;
site, and recommendations for protection of sensitive areas and resources;&#13;
o     At selected sites, developing baseline data on which the effectiveness and effects&#13;
of the cleanup can be measured, in order to: provide feedback to Operations on&#13;
approved methods and conduct studies to evaluate new proposed methods;&#13;
o     Evaluating feasibility/environmental impacts of special issues as needed;&#13;
o     Reviewing and evaluating the appropriateness of new proposed cleanup methods,&#13;
in terms of environmental and human-health effects;&#13;
o     Setting guidelines for cleanup standards, working closely with national and local&#13;
Government agencies. Environmental Advisors will provide assistance in&#13;
evaluating the cleanup plan from an environmental and human-health perspective.&#13;
8.          The Operations Team will be responsible for:&#13;
o     Developing general cleanup methods and priorities;&#13;
o     Generating site-specific work orders detailing the work to be conducted;&#13;
o     Briefing site supervisors on the daily work plan; and&#13;
o     Generating daily reports on work progress to-date.&#13;
9.           The Logistics Team will be responsible for:&#13;
o     Making sure that there are sufficient personnel, equipment, and supplies to&#13;
complete the required work as scheduled;&#13;
o     Obtaining the necessary support services such as facilities, transportation,&#13;
communications, medical, and security services to support the project; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
o     Provide translation services needed to bridge the language barrier at all levels of&#13;
project management and documentation. Interpreters will be needed for&#13;
communications between Russian and non-Russian team members. Document&#13;
translation will be needed so that all project documents, press releases, etc. are&#13;
available in the appropriate language of the user.&#13;
10.          The Finances Team will be responsible for:&#13;
o     Monitoring and reporting all project costs&#13;
o     Preparing invoices for submittal for payment&#13;
o     Payroll, sub-contractor, and supplier payments&#13;
11.          An accounting firm is expected to be hired to assist in financial management,&#13;
including audits of the contractor's invoices. A Russian procurement advisor has been hired to&#13;
provide procurement and contract management support for Komineft. They will be responsible&#13;
for:&#13;
o     Setting up a cost-monitoring system for the contract;&#13;
o     Establishing a schedule monitoring system to help Komineft track the progress of&#13;
the project and keep it on schedule; and&#13;
o     Assisting Komineft in resolution of contract administration problems that risk&#13;
delay to the project schedule.&#13;

RussLmN FEDERATION&#13;
EMERGENCY OIL SPILL RECOVERY AND MITIGATION PROJECT&#13;
PROCUREmENT DETAILS AND PROCEDURES&#13;
1.          Section IV Part E of the Technical Annex summarizes the methods of&#13;
procurement proposed to be used to procure the contracts under which the Project will be carried&#13;
out. A schedule showing when these contracts will be awarded and when each component of&#13;
the work will commence is included in the table which follows this attachment. Each of the&#13;
major contracts is discussed below.&#13;
2.          Management Contract for Containment and Cleanup. The oil spill containment&#13;
and cleanup work will be managed by an international management contractor (IMC) chosen on&#13;
a sole-source basis considering the following factors: (i) knowledge of site conditions; (ii)&#13;
experience in oil spill containment and cleanup operations in similar conditions; (iii) technical&#13;
merit of the methods of cleanup proposed; (iv) experience and qualifications of the personnel&#13;
assigned to the contract; and (v) ability to mobilize quickly.&#13;
3.          The management contract -- which is valued at approximately US $45 million&#13;
and does not involve any of the emergency pipeline works -- is based on a standard contract&#13;
developed by the Construction Management Association of America, modified to suit local&#13;
circumstances and the unusual risks associated with the work. Under the contract, the IMC will&#13;
secure the additional materials, equipment and supervisory personnel required and manage the&#13;
ongoing work of four local subcontractors which were mobilized at the various sites of the spill&#13;
and working on containment works or cleanup under contracts with Komineft (KMN) until KMN&#13;
financing ran out.&#13;
4.          Cleanup Monitoring and Inspection Contracts. The Project will include two&#13;
consultant contracts designed to provide ongoing evaluation of performance by the management&#13;
contractor, both technically and in terms of cost. The first is a contract for the environmental&#13;
monitoring and management of the cleanup valued at US $4 million to provide guidelines,&#13;
evaluate, and monitor -- from an environmental and social perspective -- the technical&#13;
perfornance of the containment and cleanup work. The contract will finance equipment and&#13;
services to support KMN environmental monitoring obligations and to support research into spill&#13;
remediation options such as revegetation or bioremediation.&#13;
5.          Given the sizeable technical and commercial risks associated with oil spill&#13;
response operations and cost plus fee contracts, a second contract has been concluded with an&#13;
independent monitoring firm to review on a regular basis IMC compliance with the contract and&#13;
report its findings to KMN, IBRD and EBRD. This contract, which is valued at US $300,000,&#13;
will be financed by EBRD.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
6.          Social Mitigation Expenditures. The Project will include some small sub-projects&#13;
totalling approximately US $2 million to mitigate the impact of the spill on a number of&#13;
downstream communities. These could include, e.g. drilling new water wells, providing forage&#13;
for livestock, technical assistance for reindeer range management and emergency supply of&#13;
medical, veterinarian, and social services. These sub-projects will be administered by the KMN&#13;
PIU together with the firm engaged to provide environmental management of the cleanup as well&#13;
as other specialist support.  The selection of each project will be made by a group of&#13;
representatives from the affected villages according to criteria acceptable to the Bank. The&#13;
procurement methods to be used for the social assistance sub-projects will consist of the&#13;
following: (i) contracts for goods or works valued at US $200,000 equivalent or more will be&#13;
procured using ICB procedures; (ii) contracts for goods valued at between US $50,000 and US&#13;
$200,000 equivalent will be procured using international shopping procedures; (iii) contracts for&#13;
goods valued at less than US $50,000 equivalent would be procured using national shopping&#13;
procedures; (iv) contracts for works valued at less than US $200,000 equivalent would be&#13;
procured following a comparison and evaluation of at least three bids from qualified contractors;&#13;
and (v) contracts for goods or works, which under the emergency circumstances are available&#13;
from only one qualified supplier or contractor, would, with the Bank's prior approval, be&#13;
procured using direct contracting. A detailed procurement plan can only be developed when the&#13;
content and size of each sub-project is better defined.&#13;
7.          Emergency Completion of Pipeline Replacement. A contract for the completion&#13;
of the replacement of the middle section of the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline, which is valued at&#13;
approximately US $16.0 million, has been negotiated, using direct contracting procedures, with&#13;
the local firm which was carrying out the middle section pipeline replacement works until KMN&#13;
financing ran out. Only this local firm has a chance of completing the crucial tie-ins and other&#13;
works in swampy areas to remove a critical section of old pipeline from service before the&#13;
spring thaw, making possible a continuation of the works during the summer and completing the&#13;
replacement by August 1995. All other options would result in an early 1996 completion, which&#13;
would result in an unacceptable risk of further spills. The contract will be staged to ensure that&#13;
the southernmost portion of the middle section will be completed and tied in as soon as possible.&#13;
This explicitly includes the section between post 349 and post 612.&#13;
8.          The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Smaller Works will be used as a&#13;
basis for the contract for the pipeline replacement completion works. The payment schedule will&#13;
be designed to provide payment only after satisfactory completion of physical milestones. This&#13;
should provide an incentive for the contractor to maintain an acceptable quality of construction&#13;
and keep to the very tight schedule. If key milestones are not achieved, particularly the critical&#13;
winter construction works, Komineft has the option to terminate the contract. In addition, to&#13;
see that the cost of materials for the contract are reasonable, KMN's local procurement advisor&#13;
will carry out a quick shopping check of other potential suppliers of pipe, weights, tape and&#13;
valves. If better prices can be found with acceptable delivery times, the contractor will use these&#13;
vendors in the interest of economy.&#13;
9.          Pipeline Construction Inspection and Quality Control. To help ensure that the&#13;
contractor carries out acceptable quality construction and to assess integrity of the overall&#13;
pipeline, an aggressive pipeline inspection and quality control program will be set up. This&#13;
work will be carried out initially by the firm selected to be the independent monitor, and later&#13;
by a pipeline inspection company selected according to the Bank's competitive selection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
procedures for consultants. This contract is estimated at US$3.2 million. In addition, KMN's&#13;
own project implementation team will be strengthened to provide better management and quality&#13;
monitoring capacity.&#13;
10.         Pipeline Remediation and Facilities Upgrade. A number of measures will be&#13;
taken to upgrade the operation of the pipeline. The firm selected by LIB to inspect the quality&#13;
of the middle section replacement will also carry out an integrity assessment of all sections of&#13;
the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline and undertake operational system reviews. The assessment and&#13;
the operational reviews will generate recommendations of further repairs and replacements,&#13;
suggestions as to pipeline maintenance equipment that is needed as well as changes to operating&#13;
practices, such as use of corrosion inhibiting chemicals, installation of pressure relief systems&#13;
and water removal facilities. These recommendations will form the basis of a scope of work to&#13;
be carried out and a list of equipment and materials to be purchased, most likely on a turnkey&#13;
basis, by a contractor procured using ICB procedures preceded by prequalification.&#13;
11.         The overall procurement schedule is summarized in the table below.&#13;

            Recovery and Mitigation Project

        <abstracts>
            Starting in February 1994 and
            culminating in a cascade of failures in August and September
            1994 and January 1995, leaks from the Kharyage-Usinsk
            pipeline in the Usinsk region of the Komi Republic have
            resulted in one of the world's largest oil spill. In
            excess of 100,000 tons (730,000 barrels) of oil are
            estimated to be trapped in very difficult to access bogs and
            creek beds, three times the amount released during the Exxon
            Valdez spill. In autumn 1994 over 20,000 tons (140,000
            barrels) of oil were released into the Kolva River when
            temporary dikes built to contain the oil, failed during
            heavy fall rains. Serious damages were caused to downstream
            communities, in particular, Kolva village, as a result of
            the releases. The Komi Republic emergency Situation
            Commission on October 10, 1994 declared an emergency in the
            Kolva River area. Wholesale release of the remaining oil
            into the river would create an ecological disaster,
            threatening the livelihood of the downstream communities
            which depend on the river system and the overall environment
            of the Pectora river system into which the Kolva and Usa
            rivers flow. Immediate priority is completion of structures
            to contain the oil to allow orderly removal and disposal of
            gross oil. Construction of significant new structures is
            also required in the very limited time remaining before
            spring thaw. In addition to the significant containment and
            cleanup efforts required, further serious spills are likely
            from the pipeline if urgent rehabilitation investment are
            not undertaken. Continuation of oil production and transport
            is also important to provide fuel for the heating plant
            serving the Usinsk region. The project is justified on the
            basis of the severity of the present and potential
            environmental disaster, as well as the need to continue oil
            production in a sustainable way in the Komi region. In
            addition, this emergency operation will provide a vehicle
            for studying and introducing oil spill mitigation measures
            in Russia's pipeline network.
