I. URBAN TRANSPORT IN THE RIO DE JANEIRO METROPOLITAN REGION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1          This project has its origins in two major developments at the federal and state level: (a)&#13;
the decentralization of the Rio de Janeiro Urban Trains from the Federal Government to the State of Rio&#13;
de Janeiro which took place in December 1994 (as part of an ongoing Bank loan 3633-BR); and (b) the&#13;
decision of the new State administration which took office in January 1995 to achieve a more effective&#13;
integration, of all modes in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region (RJMR), with an aim of reducing&#13;
subsidies/to urban transport agencies and substantially increasing the participation of the private sector&#13;
in the operation and investment of the sector.&#13;
1.2          The State decided to embark on a program of staff rationalization and restructuring of its&#13;
urban transportation agencies as part of a State Reform Project. To consolidate the gains made in the&#13;
decentralization project and substantially increase private sector participation in its metropolitan rail&#13;
agency (Flumitrens), the State requested the assistance of the Bank to complete the rehabilitation of&#13;
Flumitrens and the integration with other modes. The identification mission took place in November&#13;
1995, and based on its findings, the Bank agreed to proceed with the evaluation of the project provided&#13;
the State of Rio de Janeiro (SRJ) would incorporate into its urban transport strategy the following two&#13;
elements: (a) effective coordination between the state and municipal governments of the Rio de Janeiro&#13;
Metropolitan Region (RJMR); and (b) a formal financing mechanisms considered crucial to create an&#13;
enabling environment for the long-term financial sustainability of the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan&#13;
Region's urban transport systems; and (c) concession, sale or liquidation of all its urban transport&#13;
agencies. The SRJ moved swiftly and diligently to include these elements in its strategy.&#13;
B. Urban Transport in the RJMR: An Overview&#13;
1.3          The Rio de Janeiro  Metropolitan&#13;
Region, with 546,865 hectares and  9.8 million       Figure 1.1: PJMR Daily Trips (Work Day)&#13;
inhabitants spread  irregularly over 18 individual      Modal Spilt Motorized Transport&#13;
municipalities is dominated by the Rio de Janeiro&#13;
Municipality (RJM) with 5.7 million inhabitants. The               FerryBoat1.0%&#13;
RJMR concentrates roughly 76 percent of the SRJ's  Car(prvate,tax)145%    Other O.5%&#13;
population on just 15 percent of its terrmtory. RJM   (    t    5     h&#13;
alone has 56 percent of the population of the state .     .0l&#13;
and 77 percent of the income of RJMR. RJM           Trai 4.0%&#13;
generates roughly 85 percent of the SRJ's income and   Subway 3.0%&#13;
4,500,000 jobs. Each day 13 million person trips take&#13;
place in the RJMR, of which forty percent are home-                            Bus 77.0%&#13;
to-work trips. Of the total trips, 67 percent are by&#13;
public transport, 11 percent by auto, 20 percent by&#13;
foot, and the remaining 2 percent by other modes. Of      Total Daily Trips = 13.18 m.I1ion&#13;
the public transport trips, 77 percent are by bus&#13;
(mostly private operators), 14.5 percent by auto (taxis, kombis), 4 percent by suburban train (Flumitrens),&#13;
3 percent by subway (Metro), 1 percent by ferry (CONERJ), and .5 percent by other modes. Of the 8.7&#13;
million trips by public modes, about half use more than one mode, requiring some sort of modal transfer:&#13;
37 percent of all Metro trips, 47 percent of all train trips, and 41 percent of all bus trips require one or&#13;
more transfers to be completed.&#13;
1.4          This level of urban transport activity, dominated by the road-based motorized modes,&#13;
has significant impacts on the RJMR's environment. Despite an existing 264-km rail network, the lack of&#13;
integration between the Metro (only 23 km) and the Flumitrens discourages more rail trips, in favor of&#13;
buses and the automobile, creating heavy congestion during peak hours and significantly increasing&#13;
home-to-work trip time. Rio's geography and topography with its hills and tunnels is prone to traffic&#13;
congestion, especially when accidents occur and/or cars break down. There is limited space for fully&#13;
segregated busways. It is estimated that each "carioca" (citizen of RJ) wastes 10-15 days a year more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
than it should due to high traffic congestion. The main users of the public transport system are from the&#13;
Baixada Fluminense (a poor section of Rio) and bear the brunt of the system's problems: (a) shortage of&#13;
capacity at peak hours, resulting in overcrowded (&gt;10 passlm2), (b) long work joumeys (2.5-4.0&#13;
hours/day for a round trip) from the metropolitan periphery to thie urban centers, with often more than two&#13;
modal transfers; and (c) paying over a fourth of their income towards fares. Lack of coordination between&#13;
the three levels of government responsible for urban transport, particularly between the SRJ and the&#13;
RJM, has led to poor tariff and modal integration, lack of prioritization in urban transport investments,&#13;
and no common policy on pricing and subsidies.&#13;
1.5          A Bank-financed Mass Transportation Plan (PTM, see Annex 13, Ref. 1) was completed&#13;
in 1995 and selected the main urban transport corridors of the RJMR as the area most in need of&#13;
rehabiilitation or new investments. This selection of corridors was based on comprehensive traffic survey&#13;
data and a demand modeling exercise with a modal split analysis comparing the several modal&#13;
alternatives for each corridor. The top-ranked group of corridors in terms of economic efficiency for the&#13;
region was the one formed by the Flumitrens metropolitan rail system, which could provide rail transport&#13;
services for many of the current road-based urban trips thereby decreasing bus congestion and&#13;
improving trip times for the users provided Flumitrens can provide an acceptable level of service in&#13;
terms of frequency and reliability. Alternative options such as busways were not considered feasible&#13;
given the volumes of passengers involved and the amount of expropriation and resettlement that would&#13;
be required. To achieve the level of service required, the PTM recommended that the Flumitrens system&#13;
be further rehabilitated and modernized to be able to carry a daily passenger load of 1.4 million&#13;
passengers by year 2002. The PTM also recommended a regional transport coordination commission&#13;
with representation from the State, Rio de Janeiro Municipality, and other municipalities of the RJMR,&#13;
users and operators be formally established to serve as a forurrm for the discussion and recommendation&#13;
of nevi major investments and common pricing and subsidy policies. Furthermore, the PTM emphasized&#13;
the need to better integrate the predominantly bus-oriented RJMR system with Flumitrens, the Metr6 and&#13;
the ferry. The Bank project team reviewed the reports prepared under the PTM and endorsed the results&#13;
of the! alternative analysis as well as the proposal for the establishment of a regional transport&#13;
coordination commission and a more integrated urban transport system. Finally, as recommended by the&#13;
PTM, the State should put in place the necessary financing mechanisms to ensure the sustainability of&#13;
the sector in the long run and prevent the deterioration caused by deferred maintenance. The above&#13;
recommendations agree with earlier Bank's departmental Economic Sector Work (Annex 13, ref. 19)&#13;
which set the foundations for the ongoing process of decentralization of railway systems from the Federal&#13;
to the State government.&#13;
1.6           Although the project team agreed with the recommendation of the PTM that Flumitrens&#13;
infrastructure and equipment needed to be rehabilitated, the main concern was to ensure that the system&#13;
be managed with a private sector orientation and would be able to overcome the problems of&#13;
mismanagement and inadequacy of maintenance budget which are common to most state-run railways&#13;
world-wide. Based on the conclusions of studies (financed under Ln. 3633-BR) on options for private&#13;
sector participation in Flumitrens, the project team organized several brainstorming meetings with the&#13;
key State decision-makers, and the result of this exercise was an agreement that the best option to&#13;
ensure an adequate level of service and the financial sustainability of the system would be a full&#13;
concession to the private sector of its operations and maintenance for a period of not less than ten years.&#13;
The second best alternative would be the concessioning out of some key railway activities such as rolling&#13;
stock maintenance and track infrastructure to the private sector while the system would be still run by a&#13;
state-appointed administration. In all cases, however, there was a consensus that after the completion of&#13;
the ongoing Ln. 3633-BR which supported the decentralization of the Flumitrens system from the Federal&#13;
Government to the State, there would still be a need for large-scale rehabilitation of the remaining rolling&#13;
stock because the lack of maintenance funds prior to decentralization of the system led to the&#13;
immobilization of almost 50 percent of the fleet. Based on the few similar experiences in the world and&#13;
since these type of concessions are normally negative (i.e., with a subsidy at least in the first 5 years),&#13;
the private sector is only interested in bidding if the bid for the concession includes a State-financed&#13;
investment plan. The project team also agreed that, since the process of concession which started with&#13;
the State Reform Loan would take at least one year and a half, it was necessary to allow Flumitrens to&#13;
start its investment plan prior to concession since its fleet availability was very low despite the cars&#13;
rehabilitated under Ln. 3633-BR. The risk of starting the rehabilitation prior to concession would be that&#13;
the concession may not materialize and a number of contracts would have been signed. However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
without the inclusion of a state-financed investment plan in the bidding document-. the concession of the&#13;
system would be less attractive to potential concessionaires, and the present state government, which&#13;
has been advocating a comprehensive urban sector reform, would have only one year left on its&#13;
mandate and a rail system in precarious position. Thus it was decided that the benefits of starting the&#13;
investment plan before the concession is signed outweigh the risks of not having a concession signed by&#13;
the agreed date.&#13;
1.7          Recent departmental Economic and Sector Work (Annex 13, ref. 19) concluded that&#13;
particulate air pollution in the northern part of the Rio Municipality and the Baixada Fluminense is serious&#13;
enough to cause significant health damages including premature mortality. Although these particulates&#13;
are mostly from industry, they are also due to transport emissions and solid waste buming. Data on&#13;
ground-level ozone is lacking but climatic conditions and emissions characteristics would suggest the&#13;
possibility of a serious ozone problem in Rio. Ozone (smog) is mainly due to transport emissions of NOx&#13;
and VOC (ozone precursors). Traffic congestion in tunnels make them unbearable due to poor&#13;
ventilation. In 1994 the number of vehicles registered in the RJMR was 1.7 million. Vehicular air pollution&#13;
has been somewhat mitigated by the use of alcohol. Vehicular accidents, on the other hand, have&#13;
become a major source of environmental risks. Congestion and overcrowding of the public transport&#13;
system are a source of envirunmental stress. Throughout the day and particularly at peak-hours noise&#13;
levels are well above the acceptable levels recommended by WHO.&#13;
1.8           After the liquidation of the only state-owned company (CTC), all bus services are&#13;
provided by private operators at one of the lowest fares in the country. The bus private operators do not&#13;
receive subsidies while Flumitrens (suburban trains), Metro (subway) and CONERJ (ferries) received&#13;
subsidies of respectively US$188 million, US$109 million and US$30 million in 1995. Annex 4 details&#13;
each of the urban transport agencies under state jurisdiction. The CTC was recently liquidated as part of&#13;
the State's move to privatize urban transport services. Bids for the concession of old CTC routes were&#13;
issued by June 30, 1997.Finally, RJMR needs to modernize its traffic engineering and control technology&#13;
to be able to cope with the present and growing number of road-based vehicles and introduce policies&#13;
which will discourage the rapidly growing use of automobiles for home-to-work trips.&#13;
1.9          The road network is radial and converges on the central business district. The&#13;
commercial speed of the buses in the reserved bus lanes is around 30 km/hr but drops to 20 km/hr or&#13;
less in the central business district. At peak period, most highway corridors are clogged with bumper to&#13;
bumper buses and automobiles. Bus services are generally of low speed and unreliable at peak hours&#13;
due to the congestion. Although they are privately operated, the municipal bus routes are allocated on&#13;
the basis of competitive bidding and regulated by the Secretary of Municipal Transport, a municipal&#13;
agency. The privately operated intermunicipal bus services are under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of&#13;
Transport of the State. Tariffs are set by those agencies and there are no subsidies paid to private bus&#13;
operators. In the Rio de Janeiro Municipality (RJM), there is a flat tariff which applies to all the&#13;
municipality and every trip. In the case of the intermunicipal services the tariffs are distance-based.&#13;
1.10         At present, Flumitrens, the State-owned suburban railway is partially integrated with 150&#13;
bus lines in 30 terminals, which generates about 47 percent of its demand without an integrated tariff.&#13;
Flumitrens is also integrated with the Metro in 3 stations of which the most important is D. Pedro II.&#13;
Flumitrens estimates that with more frequent services, increased train availability and reliability,&#13;
rehabilitation of 13 stations, 5 intermodal integration terminals, and a number of pedestrian crosswalks,&#13;
demand would increase substantially. For passengers who have their origins and destinations within&#13;
walking distance of the stations, Flumitrens offers the most comfortable and reliable mode of transport.&#13;
However, if the origins and destinations are beyond a reasonable walking distance, the lack of good&#13;
integration and the lack of stations at important demand generation centers, makes the use of the system&#13;
awkward and more expensive. This lack of sufficient integration between Flumitrens and buses&#13;
discourages more rail trips and encourages bus and automobile usage, thereby increasing the heavy&#13;
congestion during peak hours and significantly increasing home-to-work trip time. In its program to&#13;
decentralize the responsibility of operation of its metropolitan systems from the Federal Government to&#13;
the State (Ln. 3633-BR), a first attempt at improving integration was made, but it fell short of its goals&#13;
mainly because the train fleet available at the time the State took over the system was well below what&#13;
had been estimated at appraisal, due to a lack of promised Federal budget resources for routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C. Institutional Responsibilities for Urban Transport in the RJMR&#13;
1.11         There are three main government bodies responsible for overseeing the urban transport&#13;
sector in the RJMR: (a) the State Secretary of Transport (SECTRAN) which regulates all the&#13;
intermunicipal bus services, rail-based and ferry-boat services of the region; (b) the Secretary of&#13;
Transport of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro which regulastes municipal bus services and is also&#13;
responsible for traffic management and control in the RJM; and (c) the State Directorate for Roads&#13;
(Departmento de Estradas de Rodagem do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, DER-RJ) responsible for all the&#13;
state iroads in the SRJ. Urban transport responsibilities within any of the other municipalities of the RJMR&#13;
are under the jurisdiction of the Prefeitura of that municipalit,y. Intermunicipal services fall under the&#13;
jurisdiction of the State. At present, although the RJM and the other municipalities of the RJMR are the&#13;
main beneficiaries of Flumitrens' system, the Metr6, and ferry services, they do not have direct&#13;
contributions to either the capital or operating budgets of urban transport agencies. This is a situation&#13;
which must be addressed through formal financing mechanisms since it is only reasonable that they pay&#13;
their lair share in the provision of transport services which benefit the employers and users in their&#13;
territoiries.&#13;
1.12          Municipal bus operators have a clearing house (Camara de CompensaQao) for bus&#13;
tariffs, and they pay bus services according to a standard cost formula which they approve. In this&#13;
manner, they compensate bus companies which operate with tariffs below the estimated cost of the&#13;
formula. Intermunicipal bus services do not have a clearing house and do not receive a subsidy from the&#13;
government.&#13;
1.13          Since three levels of government have been formulating policies and regulating urban&#13;
transport without a formal coordinating arrangement, there has been a lack of consistency in the fares&#13;
chargEid by similar or competing modes, duplication of investments, absence of criteria to prioritize&#13;
investments, and only embryonic modal integration. This has led to bus services continuing to operate in&#13;
corrido,rs in which Flumitrens operates (especially since the introduction of the flat tariff in the&#13;
municipality), expensive and time-consuming disagreements on whether to build a light rail transport, the&#13;
lack of promotion for hub and spoke services, disparate subsidy policies often based on non-economic&#13;
considerations, and the absence of user representation in the urban transport decision-making process.&#13;
Recently, there has been an effort to integrate rail and intermunicipal bus services. The creation of a&#13;
Regionial Transportation Coordination Commission (RTCC) would ensure that this cooperation would not&#13;
depend on the political parties in power.&#13;
1.14         The lack of a coordinating entity with a unified approach to cost-recovery policies and&#13;
the lack of effective oversight by the State and the Municipality have resulted in the poor definition of&#13;
priorities in the RJMR, limited modal and tariff integration, and operating agencies which have no pre-set&#13;
operational and financial targets. The SRJ as part of this project has established the Ag6ncia&#13;
Metropolitana de Transporte Urbano (AMTU-RJ) which will fulfill the functions of a RTCC as described in&#13;
Annex 3. As required by the proposed project, the SRJ and RJM signed a convenio to create the AMTU-&#13;
RJ. A formal AMTU-RJ was established by a governor's resolution in January 1997.&#13;
D. Key Sectoral Issues&#13;
1.15         There are a number of key issues which must be addressed to improve the supply of&#13;
urban transport services and to guarantee their orderly development and sustainability in the long term in&#13;
the RJMR. They are: (a) capacity and safety issues; (b) institutional issues; (c) regulatory issues; (d) cost&#13;
recovery and financial management issues; (e) poverty alleviation and subsidy targeting; (f)&#13;
environmental issues; (g) transport planning issues; and (h) private sector participation in investments&#13;
and operations.&#13;
1.16         Capacity and Safety-Related Issues. First and foremost is the need to increase the&#13;
supply of adequate cost-efficient peak-hour capacity in order to guarantee an acceptable level of service&#13;
to the average commuter under reasonable safety conditions. This can be done by: (a) rehabilitating and&#13;
restructuring Flumitrens; (b) building new mass transit systems (busways, LRTs) which prove to be the&#13;
best alternative from the technical, economic and, especially, financial standpoint; (c) improving traffic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
management through appropriate traffic engineering equipment in order to better manage available road&#13;
space and reduce congestion; and (d) reducing traffic and transit accidents through a combination of&#13;
transit safety education campaigns, law enforcement, and appropriate traffic engineering. The proposed&#13;
project would mainly strengthen Flumitrens' carrying capacity.&#13;
1.17         Institutional Issues. These are: (a) the fine-tuning of relations between state and&#13;
municipal governments and a clear definition of their respective roles in the financing, planning and&#13;
operation of urban transport services in accordance with the 1988 Constitution; (b) the creation of an&#13;
entity which is formally empowered by the RJMR for planning, coordinating and setting priorities for new&#13;
investments and modal integration including tariff setting and cost sharing, in order to assure a minimum&#13;
of planning continuity; and (c) the appropriate modification of regulation, including the elimination of any&#13;
remaining regulatory barriers which might prevent free entry and/or competition in the market for&#13;
provision of transport services especially bus services. The proposed project was instrumental in&#13;
achieving the establishment of an RTCC.&#13;
1.18         Cost Recovery and Financial Management Issues. The need to address cost&#13;
recovery from a more commercial-oriented standpoint by: (a) setting tariffs which, when added to&#13;
subsidies, cover at least the long-run variable costs (defined as out-of-pocket costs plus depreciation of&#13;
equipment and cost of capital) of the service provided and by controlling fare evasion; (b) setting&#13;
appropriate peak and off-peak pricing; (c) improving the financial management of the systems by wide&#13;
ranging cost-cutting measures, staff rationalization policies, and by appointing more financial managers&#13;
to run the mass transit systems; and (d) revamping funding mechanisms in order to guarantee adequate&#13;
financing for the implementation of new mass transit systems and the sustainability of the existing&#13;
systems. All the above issues would be addressed by the proposed project, through the concession.&#13;
1.19         Adequate Targeting of Subsidies. Blanket subsidies paid to operators, such as the&#13;
ones paid to Flumitrens/Metr6/CTC/CONERJ, ought to be eliminated. However, urban households have&#13;
been devoting increasingly large proportions of their incomes to transport, and transport-related&#13;
expenditures have become a considerable burden on local government budgets. The appropriate&#13;
targeting of urban transport subsidies and their extension to the informal sector which is not presently&#13;
covered by mechanisms such as the "vale-transporte" is a major issue which must be addressed in the&#13;
short term. Appropriate mechanisms for financing such subsidies (tariff differentiation, contracted&#13;
budgetary transfers, etc.) and channeling them (tokens, multimodal passes, differential tariffs) need to be&#13;
designed. Tariff policies, subsidies and financing mechanisms were carefully studied during the&#13;
preparation of the proposed loan, and a law to establish formal financing mechanisms for urban transport&#13;
was submitted to the state legislature.&#13;
1.20         Environmental Issues. A reduction of the environmental impacts of urban congestion&#13;
and noise pollution in the urban area would be brought about through cleaner and quieter systems. The&#13;
assessment of the potential role of market-based incentives to address pollution and implement, to the&#13;
extent possible, the polluter pay principle (PPP) to minimize the fiscal burden implied by de facto&#13;
govemment subsidies to polluters; design the allocation of responsibilities across government levels for&#13;
the enforcement of the law and definition of tougher standards. The Rio Special Environmental Control&#13;
Fund (FEEMA) must be equipped to monitor vehicle emissions and noise. An extensive environmental&#13;
review of the RJMR has been recently completed by the Bank and its recommendations have been taken&#13;
into account in this proposed loan.&#13;
1.21         Planning Issues. There is a need to strengthen RJMR's transportation planning, traffic&#13;
data base, traffic management, and the economic and financial evaluation of new investments,&#13;
especially the proposed systems for the Niter6i-S.Gongalo link and the extension of the Metr6 to Barra&#13;
da Tijuca. This could be done quite easily if there is a formal coordinating agency for urban transport in&#13;
the metropolitan region. The proposed project would strengthen planning capacities and the data bases&#13;
of the RJMR.&#13;
1.22         Private Sector Participation. The concession in full or by group of activities or sale to&#13;
the private sector of each urban transport agency and its assets, namely Flumitrensl&#13;
Metr6/CTC/CONERJ, might be a way to ensure that the level of service provided is respected and the&#13;
infrastructure and equipment are properly maintained. In Flumitrens, the maintenance of the rehabilitated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
fleet must be taken very seriously to avoid what is now happening (fleet availability is down to 58&#13;
percent). Furthermore, it is through privatization that some urban systems were able to arrest the chronic&#13;
fare evasion experienced in state-owned organizations. Early indications suggest fare evasion is&#13;
probably as much as 30 percent in Flumitrens. The SRJ should consider an increase in the private sector&#13;
participation in investment and operations of its systems. The concession of Flumitrens, Metr6 and&#13;
CONERJ and the sale of CTC were agreed upon in the State Reform Loan and would be consolidated&#13;
under the proposed project.&#13;
1.23         In the future, urban transport policies in the RJMR should be geared toward the efficient&#13;
and equitable provision of urban transport services, in particular for low-income groups which have&#13;
traditionally received less attention. Policies should be consistent with broad transport sector objectives,&#13;
as well as with the objectives of the urban subsector. In accordance with the 1988 Constitution, the&#13;
policies should support the decentralization of urban transport services from the Federal Government to&#13;
the St,ates to facilitate modal and tariff integration and respond quickly to local needs. The policies&#13;
should simultaneously address the need for institutional coordination and an integrated urban transport,&#13;
land use, and environmental strategy. The general approach is to restore the incentives which exist when&#13;
privately-owned systems operate under competitive conclitions. Redesigned regulations and&#13;
concessionary agreements, and improved bidding processes will promote competition in the provision of&#13;
bus services. Rates should be gradually liberalized in the corridors where there is effective competition.&#13;
Urban and metropolitan train operations should be owned by tlhe state and/or local governments and&#13;
operated by private interests operating under concessionary arrangements. Appropriate tariffs and&#13;
financing mechanisms would enable the efficient operation and development of the systems. Local&#13;
govemments would continue to be responsible for traffic regulation and management but would improve&#13;
their capacity to: (a) manage road use; (b) improve traffic management and street maintenance; (c)&#13;
protect the environment; (d) monitor the effects of regulations and taxation; (e) promote integration of the&#13;
various transport systems; and (f) coordination with land-use development.&#13;
E. Lessons from Experience in the Sector&#13;
1.24         Initial Bank support for the urban transport sector in Brazil was provided through four&#13;
urban transport projects totaling US$540 million, of which the First, Second and Third Urban Transport&#13;
Projects (Loans 1563-BR, 1839-BR, 1965-BR) have been cornpleted. The Fourth Urban Transport&#13;
Project, which continued the work started in the Third project, was canceled because the government&#13;
abolished the federal agency in charge of urban transport (EBTU). Additional urban transport projects&#13;
financed by the Bank (Loans 3457-BR and 3633-BR for US$126 million and US$128 million respectively)&#13;
support the rehabilitation and decentralization of the CBTU from the Federal to the State governments in&#13;
SAo Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Loan 3457-BR (Sao Paulo) became effective on February 3, 1993. Loan&#13;
3633-BR (Rio de Janeiro) was signed October 14, 1993 and became effective March 14, 1994. Loan&#13;
3633-BR financed a number of studies dealing with the evaluation of options to concession out the&#13;
Flumitrens and Metr6 and contributed to the preparation of the presently proposed project.&#13;
1.25         To build upon the experience of past urban transport projects for the design of the&#13;
proposed project, an analysis of lessons learned was undertaken (Annex 1). The review was based on&#13;
Project Completion Reports and Performance Audit Reports (PCR/PAR) in urban transport and urban&#13;
development worldwide. Recognition was made of trends and changes in project design since the&#13;
PCRs/PARs were completed. The main lessons identified and incorporated into the design of the&#13;
proposed project are:&#13;
(a)   Institutional Strengthening. The organizations dealing with urban transport at&#13;
the federal, state and municipal levels should be reorganized and strengthened.&#13;
Studies included in the institutional component must be carefully monitored and&#13;
translated into action plans which the Borrower would implement;&#13;
(b)    Lack of counterpart funding has greatly influenced the pace of project&#13;
implementation and in some cases has led to cancellation of components. An&#13;
effort must be made to ensure that adequate provision of counterpart funds are&#13;
included in the annual budgets of federal and state enterprises;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7-&#13;
(c)    Slow implementation has been a frequently occurring theme. The reasons&#13;
have included: lack of familiarity with Bank procedures, over-optimistic&#13;
scheduling at appraisal, lack of final engineering designs at appraisal, changes&#13;
in political commitment, and lack of counterpart funds. These problems would be&#13;
mitigated in the proposed project by such measures as: strengthening capacity&#13;
of operating agencies for financial management and application of Bank&#13;
procedures; and requiring final engineering design of the first years works, for&#13;
which technical assistance should be contracted if need be with retroactive&#13;
financing; and&#13;
(d)    Rail Decentralization. Experience in both ongoing Lns. 3457-BR and 3633-BR&#13;
suggest that the decentralization of systems from the federal to the state level&#13;
must be followed by complete restructuring of the newly-formed companies&#13;
preferably with concessioning of the operations and maintenance of the systems&#13;
to the private sector. So far, the Buenos Aires concessioning of suburban rail&#13;
services and the subway to the private sector has substantially increased the&#13;
quality of the service provided and greatly reduced subsidies. Otherwise, there is&#13;
little motivation for government-appointed managers to reduce working subsidies&#13;
and improve the level of service offered by the systems.&#13;
F. The Bank's Strategy for the RJMR&#13;
1.26         Subsector strategy. In view of the issues stated above, the Bank's strategy would be&#13;
divided into short, medium and long term. In the short term: (a) assisting the state and municipal&#13;
govemments in formulating and implementing an urban transport policy consistent with the above goals;&#13;
(b) strengthening the institutional framework and the decision-making process in the sector through&#13;
adequate coordination between the two levels of government and proper technical, economic and&#13;
especially, financial evaluation of projects and their prioritization by a regional coordination agency; (c)&#13;
supporting a program to rehabilitate and extend existing services such as metro lines and busways,&#13;
which can more readily increase their efficiency and peak-hour capacity; (d) assisting in the concession&#13;
of the state-owned urban transport systems to the private sector; (e) managing the demand for road use&#13;
through improved traffic management and road-user taxes in order to reduce existing congestion and the&#13;
demand for travel by private single-occupancy automobiles; (f) decreasing the number of fatalities and&#13;
accidents due to urban transport; (g) introducing better cost-recovery mechanisms, including adequate&#13;
cost-based peak-hour tariffs and fare evasion control in order to strengthen their financial base; and (h)&#13;
improving the targeting of subsidies to those who need them. In the medium term, the Bank's strategy&#13;
will focus on promoting a more efficient and financially sustainable market-oriented supply of public&#13;
transport services, through: (a) reforming regulations which will facilitate market entry, fare deregulation,&#13;
and public bidding in route allocation; (b) promoting service differentiation especially in the bus systems;&#13;
(c) defining eligibility requirements and strengthening funding mechanisms for urban transport to cover&#13;
operating deficits (based on pre-agreed targets in contract plans) and finance major investments; (d)&#13;
supporting the evaluation and, if justified, the introduction of new investments such as reserved busways&#13;
and light rail transport; (e) reducing the environmental impacts of urban transport by setting standards for&#13;
air quality, noise pollution, and visual intrusion along with indicating who would pay for them and how;&#13;
and (f) assisting in projects which improve the data base required for appropriate planning such as&#13;
origin/destination surveys and preparation of master plans which study land use and urban transport&#13;
alternatives. In the long term, the Bank's strategy will aim at reducing the travel demand and increasing&#13;
the effectiveness of transport facilities by integrating land use and transport planning based on significant&#13;
input or management by locally-affected parties.&#13;
&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Backgrouncl&#13;
2.1          As mentioned in Section I, this project has its origins in the decision of the Govemment&#13;
of Brazil to transfer the Rio de Janeiro subdivision of the Brazilian Urban Train Company to the State&#13;
Government, and the willingness of the State of Rio de Janeiro to better integrate urban trains with the&#13;
state-owned subway, the ferry system, and the bus transport system. In addition, faced with huge&#13;
subsidies to urban transport agencies (estimated at 8-10 percent of State revenues), the State embarked&#13;
on a far-reaching staff rationalization and concession program aided by the Bank's recently approved&#13;
State Reform loan.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.2          The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Brazil, discussed by the Board on June 12,&#13;
1997, is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic growth and social&#13;
development in a context of macroeconomic stability. The emphasis is on efficient resource allocation,&#13;
increased efficiency in the public sector, the appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the&#13;
low-income population; and on improving the creditworthiness of the Brazilian states. The proposed&#13;
project is fully consistent with this assistance strategy since it is designed to: (a) promote reforms and&#13;
financial viability of public enterprises, including concessions or sale of state-owned urban transport&#13;
agencies to the private sector; (b) foster private sector participation in the development of new&#13;
infrastructure and its operation; (c) increase the efficiency of infrastructure investments; (d) contribute to&#13;
poverty alleviation; and (e) reduce Government subsidies through improved tariff policies and financial&#13;
management. The proposed project is also a follow-up to the efforts started with the Rio de Janeiro&#13;
Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3633-BR) which decentralized the federally-owned&#13;
CBTU to the State of Rio de Janeiro to allow for more effective miodal and tariff integration.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
2.3          The main project objectives are: (a) to improve the quality of urban transport services in&#13;
the RJIMR by enhancing the development of a fully integrated urban transport system; and (b) to&#13;
substantially improve the level of service provided by Flumitrens while reducing the operating subsidies&#13;
it receives from the State through the substantial participation of the private sector in its operations and&#13;
management.&#13;
2.4          Objective (a) would be achieved by the rehabilitation/construction of transfer stations&#13;
between the several modes, the introduction of multimodal tariffs, and the establishment of a Regional&#13;
Transport Coordination Commission in charge of coordinating and recommending common policies on&#13;
pricing, financing and project evaluation in the RJMR. Objective (b) would be achieved through an&#13;
investment program for the rehabilitation/modernization of Flumitrens facilities and equipment and a full&#13;
or partial concession of the operations and management of the railway to the private sector as a means&#13;
of reducing the subsidies Flumitrens receives from the State.&#13;
2.5          Subsidiary objectives would be the improvement of the mobility of the low-income&#13;
population who are the main user of Flumitrens and public transport, and the reduction of the&#13;
environrnental impacts (mainly air quality and noise) on the RJMR due to road-based vehicle use.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
2.6          The project would comprise two components:&#13;
(a)    an Infrastructure and Equipment component (96 percent of the total project&#13;
cost) including: (i) rehabilitating/refurbishing of Flumitrens' rolling stock and&#13;
infrastructure; and (ii) rehabilitating or building transfer stations between the&#13;
trains and other modes (Metro, buses and ferries); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
(b)    an Institutional and Policy Development component (4 percent of the total&#13;
project cost) to help in: (i) supporting the process of concessioning Flumitrens to&#13;
the private sector through technical assistance for the preparation and&#13;
evaluation of bids; (ii) operating the RTCC for the RJMR; (iii) preparing an&#13;
integrated Transport Policy, Land Use and Air Quality Management strategy for&#13;
the RJMR to meet both transport and air quality targets and to introduce sound&#13;
cost-recovery, tariff, regulatory and subsidy policies; (iv) a comprehensive&#13;
retraining program for Flumitrens staff in view of the planned restructuring of the&#13;
company; (v) preparing feasibility studies and bidding documents for the&#13;
proposed Niter6i-S.Gon,alo extension and other priorities of the mass transit&#13;
system; and (vi) implementing an Environmental and Traffic subcomponent&#13;
including: (a) a study to review the ongoing vehicle inspection/maintenance&#13;
program; and (b) a comprehensive review of traffic violations with emphasis on&#13;
a more reliable system to collect traffic violation fines and enforce them as a&#13;
deterrent to traffic accidents.&#13;
Part A - Infrastructure and Equipment Component&#13;
2.7           This component represents 96 percent of the total project cost and is designed to&#13;
improve the infrastructure and equipment of Flumitrens to a level which is deemed necessary to attract&#13;
potential private sector concessionaires as summarized below.&#13;
2.8           The Civil Works Program which would account for 8 percent of Part A component&#13;
would consist of: (a) rehabilitation and modernization of 11 stations; (b) construction of two stations; (c)&#13;
construction of five pedestrian over/underpasses; and (d) eight km of fences in areas adjacent to stations&#13;
to reduce evasion.&#13;
2.9           The Permanent Way Program which would account for 2 percent of Part A includes&#13;
installation of sleepers, and the superstructure for the second track in Gramacho-Saracuruna.&#13;
2.10         The Systems Program which would account for 21 percent of Part A would consist of:&#13;
(a) installation and repair of transmission lines in the Leopoldina corridor; (b) rehabilitation/construction of&#13;
electric substations; (c) installation of Central Traffic Control (CTC) in D. Pedro II and Deodoro yards and&#13;
Sta. Cruz and Japeri corridors; (d) the installation of Automatic Train Control system in Deodoro, Sta.&#13;
Cruz and Japeri corridors; (e) automatic fare collection; and (f) telecommunications, with the installation&#13;
of fiber optics cable links in the Japeri corridor, the provision of a central station, and an integrated&#13;
telecommunication system in the CCO.&#13;
2.11         The Rolling Stock Program, which would account for 65 percent of Part A, would&#13;
consist of the rehabilitation of 103 Electrical Multiple Units (EMUs), the refurbishment of 36 EMUs.&#13;
Part B - Institutional Development and Policy&#13;
2.12         This component is designed to assist the State in the continuation of the implementation&#13;
of the concessions and management contracts jump-started by the proposed State Reform project for&#13;
Flumitrens, Metr6, CONERJ and CTC lines or services. A package of institutional and policy reforms is&#13;
needed to induce modernization changes and motivate management and staff. In addition this&#13;
component would be used to strengthen the regional transport coordination commission to ensure that&#13;
modal integration, tariff and subsidy policies, and prioritization of future urban transport projects in the&#13;
region become a reality. This component would account for 4 percent of the total project cost.&#13;

2.13         Flumitrens-Related Studies.&#13;
(a)    Assisting the Concession to the Private Sector. The first set of Actions Plans&#13;
concems the preparation of bid documents to be used in the concession&#13;
process: (i) institutional and organizational arrangements; (ii) investment plan to&#13;
be undertaken; (iii) evaluation of operating subsidies; (iv) patrimonial agreement&#13;
on the valuation and assets to transferred; (v) aspects relating to transfer of&#13;
personnel, pension benefits, and miscellaneous human resource-related issues;&#13;
and (vi) legal and administrative aspects for concession;&#13;
(b)    Technical Assistance Until the Concession. This technical assistance would&#13;
provide key advisors who would work with the President of Flumitrens to further&#13;
rationalize and stream line operations and maintenance to decrease the&#13;
perceived risks of the concession. For example, hiring of experts in rolling stock&#13;
maintenance and railways operations mianagement, management accounting to&#13;
define clear cost allocation rules, specialists to implement the payroll software,&#13;
and experts to build a reliable data base;&#13;
(c)    Technical Engineering Studies in Signaling and Telecom. These studies&#13;
would address the needs identified during preparation for the installation of&#13;
existing and new signaling and telecom equipment; and&#13;
(d)    Supervision Consultants. The implementation of the investment plan would be&#13;
supervised by engineering consultants in charge of ensuring that the works and&#13;
goods comply with specifications; and Project Management Consultants.&#13;
These consultants would be in charge of supporting the Project Management&#13;
and Implementation Group until the completion of the Project.&#13;
2.14         Modal Integration Related Study. The objective of the second set of Action Plans is to&#13;
support the establishment of the RTCC policy framework and provide practical recommendations for&#13;
implementing modal integration, namely: (a) updating of the Transport, Land Use, and Air Quality portion&#13;
of the Master Plans of the RJMR with emphasis on route rationalization and modal and tariff integration;&#13;
(b) an intermunicipal route management and rationalization study; and (c) preparation of feasibility&#13;
studies and bidding documents for the Niter6i - Sao Gongalo rnass transportation system. The RJMR&#13;
master plan should be analyzed in order to give the basic guidelines for the development of future&#13;
systeims for this corridor.&#13;
2.15         Training. In view of the concession, staff who remain with Flumitrens holding would&#13;
have two primary functions: (a) to manage the implementation of the investment plan; and (b) to monitor&#13;
the concessionaire on behalf of the State Regulatory Entity (ASEP-RJ).&#13;
2.16         Environmental and Traffic Safety Program. The environmental and traffic safety&#13;
prognam is estimated to cost US$1.1 million and accounts for 0.4 percent of the total project cost. It&#13;
would consist of: (a) a study to review the ongoing inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for vehicle&#13;
emissions and noise and propose corrective measures; and (b) a comprehensive review of traffic&#13;
violations with emphasis on a more reliable system to collect traffic violation fines and enforce them as a&#13;
deterrent to traffic accidents.&#13;
E. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
2.17         The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$373 million including physical and&#13;
price contingencies, with an estimated foreign component of US$186 million or about 50 percent of total&#13;
cost. Taxes and duties are expected to account for about 15 percent of total costs or US$57 million&#13;
equivalent. Physical contingencies add up to US$30 million, or 9 percent of the base cost, and price&#13;
contingencies are estimated at US$19 million or 6 percent of the base cost plus physical contingencies.&#13;
The contingencies were estimated on the basis of the disbursement schedule (an estimated&#13;
implernentation period of six years) and on the following forecast of price escalation for both local and&#13;
foreign expenditures expressed in US dollars: 2.9 percent in 1996, 2.0 percent in 1997, 2.1 percent in&#13;
1998, 2.3 percent in 1999, 2.4 percent in 1999, 2.4 percent in 2000 and 2.3 percent in 2001. Base costs&#13;
correspond to January 1996 prices. The costs of goods are based upon supplier quotations for similar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 1 1 -&#13;
Brazilian-made items and recent prices of imported items. The cost of several components of the works&#13;
program such as, permanent way, two new stations, and the administrative building are based upon&#13;
detailed engineer designs and prevailing unit prices; the cost of other components of the works program&#13;
are based upon preliminary engineering designs and prevailing unit prices from recent tenders under&#13;
Loans 3457-BR and 3633-BR. Final engineering designs for the remaining components under the project&#13;
are underway. Cost estimates for consultant services are based upon prevailing local and foreign staff-&#13;
months rate; they provide for the cost of local transportation, office equipment, other minor items, and&#13;
where appropriate, intemational travel and per diem.&#13;

2.1El        The project would be financed from the propiosed Bank loan of US$186 million (50&#13;
percent of the project cost) and the SRJ contributions of about US$187 million equivalent, including&#13;
US$57 million in taxes and duties (50 percent of the project cost). During loan negotiations, agreement&#13;
was reached on: (a) the project financing plan; and (b) the guarantee of the SRJ regarding all necessary&#13;
counterpart funds for the project.&#13;
F. Project Benefits and Risks&#13;
2.19         Project Benefits. Quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits are expected from the&#13;
provision of an integrated rail and bus network including cost savings, time savings for the users, fewer&#13;
accidents and fatalities, and employment generation through better spatial integration of markets.&#13;
Important effects on the urban structure are expected if the RJMR rail based network becomes an axis&#13;
fed by the major bus routes. In addition, there would be a positive environmental impact through the&#13;
reduction of fossil fuel consumption, reduction of motor-vehicle related emissions, and a reduction in&#13;
road congestion, with a consequent improvement in air quality and noise pollution. The project would&#13;
facilitate access to employment and services, particularly for the low-income population. Development of&#13;
an integrated public transport system under a regional coordination body in charge of combining state&#13;
and municipal pricing and subsidy policies, prioritizing major investments, and proposing common&#13;
demand management measures in the RJMR, are important non-quantifiable benefits. Finally, by&#13;
concessioning out to the private sector the operations and maintenance of Flumitrens, the proposed&#13;
project would be a first step towards decreasing the investment and subsidy burden on the state.&#13;
2.20         Project Risks. The usual risks associated with investment projects-cost and time&#13;
overruns-apply to this project. The investment, however, is in well-known technology, available from&#13;
many sources. Delays in the procurement process were minimized by starting at pre-appraisal the pre-&#13;
qualification for lots in the critical path of project implementation, by the use of standard bidding&#13;
documents, and by requiring the borrower to produce the major tender documents by negotiations.&#13;
Further risks include problems with the formal establishment and sustainability of the RTCC, possible&#13;
delays in the procurement process and in the rehabilitation of Flumitrens' rolling stock (which has a direct&#13;
impact on demand), delays in the actual award or failure to concession out Flumitrens, delays in&#13;
controlling fare evasion, and the timely availability of counterpart funds. Negotiations between the State&#13;
and Municipal Governments have progressed very well for modal and tariff coordination and a&#13;
forerunner of the RTCC has already been established. All parties have agreed on the need for an&#13;
integrated urban transport system but there is still a risk that the involved parties will be reluctant to rely&#13;
on R1CC's consensus and advice due to political differences between the State Government and the&#13;
Mayor of Rio d Janeiro. It is, however, expected that just the discussion of the main urban transport&#13;
issues and recommendations of the RTCC will generate pressure for politicians to seek metropolian&#13;
rather than state-only or municipal-only solutions. The pre-qualification documents for rolling stock&#13;
rehabilitation were already issued, and several trains rehabilitated under Ln. 3633-BR will be available&#13;
before! the concession. The contracting of the concession of Flumitrens is a condition for the&#13;
disbursement of the second tranche of the State Reform Project. The timely availability of counterpart&#13;
funds would be addressed by seeking assurances that they are included in the SRJ's CY97 and CY98&#13;
budgets and future budget projections. If the concession process fails, the repercussions are: (a) the&#13;
State-appointed management of Flumitrens may not have the independence required to run the railway&#13;
as a commercially-oriented concern. This might affect the service and the control of fare evasion having,&#13;
therefore, an impact on net revenues; and (b) part of the proposed investment would have been&#13;
committed. The proposed investment would always be beneficial to the railway because it would be&#13;
mainly in rolling stock. In case the award of the concession does not materialize, the Bank would press&#13;
for the second best altemative which calls for substantial outsourcing of railway maintenance activities. If&#13;
this is the case, the economic rate of return of the project would still be high (33 percent). In case the&#13;
concession fails to materialize, the fall in ridership would bring the economic rate of return down to 15&#13;
percent.&#13;
G. Tariff Setting and Affordability by Low-income Users&#13;
2.21         Poverty, Affordability and Subsidies. The growing crisis in urban transportation in&#13;
Brazil, especially in the metropolitan regions, demands a close look at alternatives for financing services&#13;
in a more predictable and sustainable way while, at the same time, targeting subsidies more directly to&#13;
low-inoDme ridership. The various initiatives already underway within ongoing Lns. 3457-BR and 3633-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
BR to improve efficiency through tariff increases, service improvements, and trip reliability, as well as&#13;
efforts focused on reducing operating costs, are planned to continue.&#13;
2.22         Approximately 56 percent of the urban population earns less than four minimum salaries&#13;
(US$400/month). If successfully implemented, the project would primarily benefit the low-income&#13;
population in the participating cities, since they depend mainly on bus, metro and suburban rail services&#13;
to commute to and from work, especially those living in the favelas for whom access to the areas of&#13;
employment is a daily ordeal.&#13;
2.23         To make urban transport affordable to the low-income population, it is necessary to&#13;
strengthen and expand the eligibility of the vale-transporte program to low-income residents which are&#13;
not formally employed, to substantially promote integrated (bus-rail) fares, which should be always lower&#13;
than the sum of individual modal fares, and to increase the overall level of service provided to the users.&#13;
This would result in lower travel times due to higher frequencies and operating speeds, reduction of&#13;
waiting time, much higher reliability and safety, bringing down therefore, the overall generalized (tariff,&#13;
time and safety) transport cost to the user and thus alleviating the burden that urban transportation&#13;
imposes on low-income households. It is noteworthy that annual bus and train passenger surveys&#13;
indicate even low-income riders are willing to pay higher tariffs if the service provided is faster, waiting&#13;
times are less, and the system is more reliable.&#13;
2.24         In the bidding documents for the concession of Flumitrens, the govemment would set the&#13;
tariff to be charged by the concessionaire to guarantee that it is affordable by the predominately low-&#13;
income population populations which constitute the main ridership of the Flumitrens system. The tariff&#13;
would be updated regularly to reflect inflation and would be pegged to the urban bus tariff which is&#13;
periodically updated. The concession contracts will oblige the private concessionaires of the bus, rail,&#13;
metro and ferries to negotiate joint tariffs which are less than the sum of individual tariffs.&#13;
2.25         Under the State Reform Project, the State has commissioned a study to recommend the&#13;
most appropriate tariff policies for the RJMR in a context where there would be several privates&#13;
concessionaires. The study will propose ways of introducing a multi-modal ticket and how to allocate its&#13;
proceeds amongst the several concessionaires.&#13;
2.26         Review of Financing Mechanisms. In conclusion, it was agreed that efforts should be&#13;
focused on seeking a solution(s) that would: (a) generate sufficient resources to maintain stable and&#13;
predictable funding for urban transport investments; and (b) establish mechanisms to generate adequate&#13;
operating cross-subsidies from within transport related taxes, user charges, etc., to provide adequate&#13;
support for normalization (operating deficits) transfers. The SRJ has submitted to its legislature a draft&#13;
law proposing financing mechanisms for funding urban transport operating subsidies while they exist and&#13;
eventual future expansions.&#13;
H. Project Economic Evaluation&#13;
2.27         A standard cost-benefit analysis was performed to evaluate the economic impact of the&#13;
implementation of the proposed Investment and Equipment program, which together represent 96&#13;
percent of the total proposed project. Direct user benefits include travel time and operating costs&#13;
savings; indirect benefits arise from the reduction of negative externalities such as accident and air&#13;
pollution costs. Investment costs comprise civil works, permanent way, operational systems, rolling stock&#13;
and project studies.&#13;
2.28         Substantial direct benefits are expected to arise from travel time savings, operating cost&#13;
savings, bus system control savings, and road maintenance cost savings. Travel time savings result&#13;
mainly from the transfer of bus passengers into the railway system and from existing Flumitrens&#13;
passengers who can save time in their trips by taking advantage of the improved transport facility. Travel&#13;
time savings also result from the increased operating speeds and shorter trips of the buses and cars&#13;
which would be feeding the rail system. Operating cost savings for the non-rail modes derive principally&#13;
from the improved commercial and traffic speeds, which can be achieved by buses and cars,&#13;
respectively. In addition, indirect benefits would arise from the reduction in negative externalities, such&#13;
as accidents and air pollution.&#13;

10 percent higher). A detailed description of the economic evaluation is given in Annex 9 and reference&#13;
number 9 of the Project File.&#13;
I. Project Financial Evaluation&#13;
2.30         Flumitrens. CBTU/STU-RJ, the predecessor of Flumitrens, historically relied on the&#13;
Federal Government to finance its operational deficits and its capital program. These operational deficits&#13;
have been attributed to low and declining ridership, insufficient tariffs, high personnel costs, and&#13;
significant rates of evasion and fraud. During 1991-95 the cost recovery from internally generated funds&#13;
varied between 11-19 percent. Personnel expenses accounted for 84 percent of the total working costs',&#13;
and the total revenues were barely enough to cover one-fourth of the working costs. Actual ridership in&#13;
1995 was about 370,000 paying passengers per day compared to the nearly one million paying&#13;
passengers in 1984. Evasion and ticket fraud was estimated at 17-22 percent in 1995 and contributed to&#13;
the poor working ratio of 6.12. Flumitrens received US$186 million in operating subsidies in 1995.&#13;
2.31         The present management of Flumitrens has put in place a new cost reduction program to&#13;
rationalize the work-force and to cut expenditures. Between 1995-1996, about 2,000 staff were let go&#13;
through various incentive programs. Similarly, overtime compensation was reduced by 10 percent in&#13;
1996. In order to better control ticket evasion and fraud, Flumitrens is in the process of outsourcing ticket&#13;
sales in its major stations. Administrative functions are ailso being re-evaluated for possible&#13;
rationalization. On the revenue side, an extensive capital investment program is under way for&#13;
increasing the capacity of the system through the recovery of paralyzed trains. In addition, Flumitrens is&#13;
actively pursuing integration among different modes of transport (bus+train, train+metro) to take&#13;
advantage of its strength as a low-cost producer. A private concessionaire is expected to be operating&#13;
Flumitrens as of January 1, 1998.&#13;
2.32         Upon completion of the proposed Bank project and other ongoing investment programs,&#13;
the railway is not only expected to recapture all of its lost traffic but also attract some new ridership. The&#13;
paying ridership is expected to increase by about 250 percent between 1996-2002 through a combination&#13;
of better management, increased capacity, and reduction of ticket evasion. Additional revenues would be&#13;
provided by an increase of the standard tariff to US$0.55, salie of advertisement space, and rental&#13;
income from the stations. The availability of extra capacity, however, is not expected to result in an&#13;
automatic increase in the ridership; the private concessionaire would have to change the image of the&#13;
suburban rail by offering timely and reliable service. It is expected that by the fourth year of the&#13;
concession, the railway would be in a position to operate without any operating subsidies from the State&#13;
Governrnent. Performance targets to monitor Flumitrens' financial situation during the project are given&#13;

2.33          State of Rio de Janeiro Finances. The finances of the State of Rio de Janeiro were&#13;
studied in detail in the context of the Rio de Janeiro State Reform Project and the analysis shows that&#13;
the State has improved its financial situation and would be able to provide the necessary counterpart&#13;
funds for the proposed loan as well the eventual subsidies which might be needed during the project time&#13;
horizon. Furthermore, the State would have the capability of, prior to concession, providing Flumitrens&#13;
with a budget which would allow the execution of routine and periodic maintenance required to improve&#13;
train availability. Annex I OB gives details of the State financial analysis.&#13;
J. Environmental Impact of the Project&#13;
2.34          The proposed project is classified as environmental category B. Since the proposed&#13;
project would greatly increase the capacity offered by the RJMR rail system, it is expected that a&#13;
substantial percentage of the passengers now carried by bus will return to their original mode of&#13;
transportation, that is, rail. This is especially true for passengers who live within walking distance from&#13;
the stations, who switched to buses because in the last five years the capacity and reliability offered by&#13;
the trains decreased considerably. Nevertheless, theoretically it is estimated that by project completion&#13;
about 1,789 fewer buses/day would be required in the streets of the RJMR, because of shifting demand&#13;
and because bus integration with the Flumitrens system would shorten bus trips. Intermunicipal buses&#13;
would operate feeder services for the rail system rather than duplicate its routes. The main expected&#13;
positive environmental impacts stem from this reduction in bus services, given their present negative&#13;
impact on the air quality, noise levels, traffic congestion, and road accidents. Population resettlement is&#13;
not foreseen given that works are in existing right-of-ways which have not been invaded. Independent&#13;
consultants physically inspected of the right-of-way and confirmed that no resettlement is needed. The&#13;
concession of Flumitrens would be preceded by an environmental and safety audit to be carried out by&#13;
independent consultants and following terms of reference provided by the Bank.&#13;
2.35          The impact on air quality is due to a reduction of emission by the buses which would be&#13;
removed from circulation or which would have their route kms shortened because they would be&#13;
operating feeder services for the rail system rather than duplicating their routes. The impact on air quality&#13;
was conservatively estimated at US$1.2 million per year in RJMR. A positive impact on noise levels is&#13;
also due to the removal of buses, especially in RJM, where the older vehicles predominantly owned by&#13;
the private sector are noisy and when bunched together cause decibel (dB) levels, which preclude&#13;
speaking at normal voice levels on the street. The impact on traffic congestion was estimated at&#13;
US$91.6 million per year in RJM and is mainly due to the shorter waiting time for commuters using their&#13;
automobiles and buses. The effect on road accidents is based on statistics which suggest that in the&#13;
metropolitan region, the number of bus accidents is a function of the number of buses on the road. It is&#13;
conservatively estimated that the savings due to fewer accidents are US$2.2 million per year in the RJM.&#13;
Even if the benefits estimated were cut in half because the bus operators would, in some cases, continue&#13;
to run the buses at lower load factors, the project would contribute positively to the environment. Benefits&#13;
which were not quantified are those related to the improved living environment which would result from&#13;
safer and cleaner stations, crossovers from the sidewalks to the stations, space for queuing up at the&#13;
wickets, ramps for the handicapped, and in some cases, modal integration with taxis, buses and private&#13;
automobiles. Other non-quantified benefits are those related to the structuring effect of a revamped rail&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
system which would attract housing in the surrounding areas. Furthermore, real estate development on&#13;
the air space above the stations and on land owned by. Flumitrens is also expected. Additional non-&#13;
quantified benefits relate to the diminished stress which the road system and congestion would impart on&#13;
the road users and the better ambiance expected in trains. Shorter trip times and faster home-to-work&#13;
trips would also have a positive effect on the rail users' welfare.&#13;
K. Private Sector Participaltion&#13;
2.36         As part of the proposed State Reform Project, the SRJ has decided to concession out to&#13;
the private sector Flumitrens and the Metr6 and to sell its assets in CONERJ (ferries) and CTC/SERVE&#13;
(buses), and concession the routes they operated to the private sector. To make Flumitrens and the&#13;
Metr8 more attractive to the private sector, the SRJ started a number of reforms. The reforms would&#13;
focussed essentially on Flumitrens and the Metr6 which together are the main contributors to 80 percent&#13;
of the operating deficit of the sector. The overall strategy to be followed in both cases is the following:&#13;
(a)    staff downsizing through voluntary and involuntary dismissals;&#13;
(b)   reduction of salary benefits to the minimum required by law;&#13;
(c)    acceleration of private sector involvement in operations and management of the&#13;
urban transport companies, through concessions and/or management contracts;&#13;
(d)   tariff adjustments to increase revenues in line with inflation; and&#13;
(e)    sale/lease land assets and building which belong to the agencies to increase&#13;
non-operating revenues.&#13;
2.37         Flumitrens and Metr6. As a top priority, the SRJ has set January 1998 as the deadline&#13;
for starting the long-term concession of the Metr8 and July 1998 for the long-term concession of&#13;
Flumitrens. To make both systems more aftractive to the private sector, the State requested that both&#13;
Flumitrens and the Metr6 put in place a downsizing program since the ratio 'revenue passengers per&#13;
staff' is low when compared to similar systems elsewhere, suggesting that payroll costs should be&#13;
reduced by almost 50 percent or the revenue passengers increased by as much. The initial staff&#13;
reduction program was completed in May 1996 with a reduction of 1800 staff in Flumitrens and 800 in&#13;
Metr8. 1-he State has used as a model and comparator for the Metr6, the Santiago, Chile subway which&#13;
has approximately the same length, almost twice as many passengers at the same average tariff and&#13;
has an operating surplus. For Flumitrens the model chosen as a comparator is the Buenos Aires&#13;
Suburbain rail system which is now operated by private concessionaires and has a productivity three&#13;
times higlher than Flumitrens. In addition, the SRJ asked Flumitrens to put in place a fare evasion control&#13;
system to increase revenues. The State has also instructed the agencies to evaluate the land and&#13;
buildings which can be sold or leased to increase non-operating revenues.&#13;
2.38         To decide the type of private management that would be more adequate for both&#13;
companies, the SRJ has launched two studies to evaluate the options for private sector participation in&#13;
the companies and to prepare the bidding documents for the selected option. These studies were&#13;
financed with funds from the ongoing Bank Loan (Ln. 3633-BR), which financed the decentralization of&#13;
the rail system from Federal to State Governments. The SRJ feels that the present State-appointed&#13;
administrations of Flumitrens and Metr6 are constrained by existing legislation from undertaking bolder&#13;
efforts to restructure their companies. The SRJ believes that a long term concession of both Flumitrens&#13;
and the Metr6 would reduce annual subsidies and improve quality of service as it did in Buenos Aires. To&#13;
make both systems more attractive to potential private sector concessionaires, the SRJ has instructed&#13;
Flumitrens and Metro's management to implement the above-mentioned downsizing programs which by&#13;
May 1996 had exceeded the targets set by the Government.&#13;
2.39         Concessions of the Flumitrens and Metro would likely follow the Argentinean model&#13;
which calls for bids to execute an investment plan financed and defined by the State, propose a schedule&#13;
of decreasing operating subsidies to be paid by the State, and provide a level-of-service stipulated in the&#13;
bidding documents at a tariff set by the Government. The proponent with the lowest net present value of&#13;
the cost of investment plan plus the subsidy is the winner of the concession. The Argentinean model&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
calls for a schedule of subsidies which become zero after a certain date, at which time the&#13;
concessionaire must start paying the govemment an annual concession fee. Suburban railway&#13;
concessions in Argentina were granted for 10 years and the subway concession was granted for 20&#13;
years. SRJ has hired a financial advisor to carry out the concession process of both Flumitrens and the&#13;
Metro and the process is underway. Consultants hired by the State are now preparing the model for the&#13;
concession and the bidding documents, following Bank's procurement guidelines.&#13;
2.40         The main difference between Flumitrens and Metro is that the latter has already secured&#13;
the funds for completing the works required to double its ridership and increase its route length from 23&#13;
to 35 km, while the former would be receiving those funds under the proposed Rio de Janeiro Mass&#13;
Transit Project. The investment for the Metro (US$298 million) came from a BNDES loan (the National&#13;
Economic and Social Development Bank), and would be used primarily for completing works started&#13;
more than 10 years ago which were halted due to the financial situation of the State. The investment for&#13;
Flumitrens (US$373 million) would be mainly devoted to rehabilitate rolling stock and upgrading the&#13;
signaling, telecom and stations necessary for the system to reach a ridership of one million passengers&#13;
per day.&#13;
2.41         CONERJ. The ferry boat company would have its assets sold to the highest bidder.&#13;
SECTRAN would act as the overseer of the private sector concessionaires which would operate the ferry&#13;
lines in the Guanabara and Sepetiba bays. The SRJ has set a date of November 1997 for completing&#13;
this sale, and has commissioned a valuation study using its own funds.&#13;
2.42         CTC and SERVE have been liquidated. Their assets are mainly buses and garages&#13;
which were sold to the private sector. The routes operated by CTC and SERVE would be taken over by&#13;
existing bus concessionaires which would be selected through competitive bidding.&#13;
2.43         CODERTE, the agency in charge of the terminals and parking garages of the State,&#13;
would also be sold. The SRJ has decided to undertake a study to determine the value of the assets&#13;
involved, to obtain all the legal titles of the properties, and to prepare terms of reference to select a real&#13;
estate company which would sell or rent the properties owned by the SRJ.&#13;
2.44         State Regulatory Entity (ASEP-RJ). The state has decided in the context of the State&#13;
Reform Project to create a State Regulatory Entity (ASEP-RE) in charge of regulation of all industries&#13;
including urban transport. This entity would in the beginning delegate some of its monitoring functions to&#13;
the Secretariat of Transport but will retain the main regulatory functions (entry, exit, disputes, and tariff&#13;
regulation). The AMTU-RJ would provide input to the ASEP-RJ whenever needed.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Ill. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Institutional Responsibiliities&#13;
3.1          The State of Rio de Janeiro would be the Borrower. The Federative Republic of Brazil&#13;
would be the Guarantor. Flumitrens or its successor would be responsible for implementing the project, in&#13;
accordance with: (a) contractual arrangements; (b) the implemientation schedule; (c) implementation&#13;
arrangements; (d) the decentralization process; (e) procurement arrangements; (f) disbursement&#13;
arrangements; (g) auditing arrangements; and (h) monitoring and reporting arrangements. These&#13;
arrangements were confirmed during negotiations, and detailed guidelines, satisfactory to the Bank, were&#13;
prepared by Flumitrens. The Bank would monitor the implementation of the project in accordance with a&#13;
monitoring and supervision plan (Annex 11).&#13;
3.2          The overall coordination and supervision of the proposed project would rest with&#13;
Flumitrens which has established a Project Management and Implementation Group (PMIG) supported&#13;
by consultants. Flumitrens and the State agreed that the PMIG would continue to manage the execution&#13;
of the project after the concession of the Flumitrens system to the private sector. This would ensure the&#13;
continuity of project management experience acquired with the ongoing Ln. 3633-BR and the State&#13;
Reform Projects and would prevent delays which could occur due a change of the project&#13;
implementation team before the conclusion of the project. To nnanage and guide the "non-hardware"&#13;
aspects (political, legal, administrative, institutional, and so forth) through the transition and until&#13;
December 1997, an intragovernmental General Coordination Committee would coordinate the work of a&#13;
number of task forces, which would carry out strategic studies on terms of reference agreed with the&#13;
Bank and prepare the bidding documents for the concessions.&#13;
B. Contractual Arrangements&#13;
3.3          In order to ensure a smooth transition to concession, and to support its subsequent&#13;
consolidation, the following legal arrangements would apply:&#13;
With the Bank:&#13;
Bank and GOB                            (Guarantor)          Guarantee Agreement&#13;
13ank and SRJ                           (Borrower)           Loan Agreement&#13;
Between governments and agencies:&#13;
SRJ and Flumitrens                      (Subsidiary Agreement and Contract Program)&#13;
Flumitrens and Private Concessionaire   (Concession Contract)&#13;
C. Implementation Schedule&#13;
3.4          The implementation of this project has been tentatively scheduled over a five-year&#13;
period (1997-2001). The project would start on November 1, 1997' and be completed by December 31,&#13;
2001, wilth a closing date of June 30, 2002. The Bank has recommended that Flumitrens should take&#13;
special care in finalizing the project implementation schedule, which is directly linked to the procurement&#13;
process, and indicated to Flumitrens that according to the Bank's experience, the bidding process for&#13;
each bid may take from 7 to 12 months, including the approval of bidding documents, advertisement in&#13;
Developrnent Business and local press, bid evaluation, recommendations for award, contract signature,&#13;
and contract effectiveness.&#13;
D. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.5          Project Management and Implementation Group (PMIG). Flumitrens would establish&#13;
and maintain a Project Management and Implementation Group (PMIG) headed by a Project Coordinator&#13;
to manage the implementation of the several components of the Bank project. The Project Coordinator&#13;
would relport directly to Flumitrens' President. Project Managemient and Implementation consultants&#13;
financed under Part A of the project would act as full-time advisers to the Project Coordinator to provide&#13;
the technical support and cross-country experience required for managing the project. These consultants&#13;
should be hired immediately after pre-appraisal. In addition to the Project Coordinator who would be&#13;
responsible for the overall financial management of the project, the PMIG would include: (a) a transport&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
economist and policy studies coordinator responsible for overseeing the execution of all the studies and&#13;
transport economics aspects of Part A of the project; (b) an engineer, with experience in procurement, to&#13;
coordinate Part B of the project; and (c) a management information systems specialist responsible for&#13;
the reporting and supervision of the project. The PMIG would be supported by a small secretariat which&#13;
would include an executive secretary and an accountant responsible for project accounts and&#13;
disbursements.&#13;
E. Concession Process&#13;
3.6          Until the concessionaire takes over, Flumitrens would continue to be managed by the&#13;
present SRJ-appointed management which would be responsible to implement the reforms described&#13;
above. Flumitrens and the SRJ would sign a contract program in which Flumitrens management would&#13;
agree to meet targets set by the SRJ. After the concession to the private sector, a Flumitrens Entity in&#13;
charge of supervising the concession and implementing the investment plan financed by the proposed&#13;
loan would remain in place and SRJ will decide, until December 1997, whether it will be part of ASEP-RJ&#13;
or/and SECTRAN. The PMIG would be part of this Flumitrens Entity together with a group of supervisors&#13;
in charge of monitoring the concessionaire. The provisional organizational structure and composition of&#13;
the Flumitrens Entity is presented in Annex 2 and will be confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
3.7          Transitional Phase to Concession. As the successful concession would be subject to&#13;
detailed negotiations, and would involve political considerations in addition to financial and technical&#13;
issues, the detailed steps and transition to concession are viewed as a dynamic process involving the full&#13;
and transparent participation of the Secretaries of Planning, Transport and Flumitrens. In order to&#13;
support this process, joint and parallel strategic studies, administrative and legal actions, organizational&#13;
changes, and key political decisions will have to be undertaken in a logical and sequential manner, and&#13;
synchronized with the timetable for processing and executing the proposed Bank loan to ensure the&#13;
completion of the concession process of Flumitrens not later than the target date of July 31, 1998. The&#13;
following steps should be included:&#13;
(a) General Coordination and Completion of Strategic Studies. The General Coordination&#13;
Committee (CG) would manage and guide the concession process. The CG would incorporate a number&#13;
of task forces. The CG, with representatives from Flumitrens, SECPLAN and SECTRAN, would report to&#13;
the SRJ Governor. The task forces would work on the strategic studies and Actions Plans necessary to&#13;
prepare the bidding process.&#13;
2.45  (b)    Concession to Private Sector. In accordance with the SRJ Government policy for&#13;
modemization of the economy, Flumitrens would be concessioned out using procurement rules&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Assurances were sought at negotiations that not later than 60 days after signing&#13;
of the loan, the SRJ would issue pre-qualification bids for the concession, and thereafter, not later than&#13;
July 31, 1998 the concession would be signed. The concession of Flumitrens would be preceded by an&#13;
environmental and safety audit to be carried out by independent consultants and following terms of&#13;
reference provided by the Bank.&#13;
3.1          Timetable for the Concession process. The project has been prepared to take into&#13;
account the SRJ Government's objective to complete concession of the Flumitrens by the target date of&#13;
July 31, 1998 . Until the concession is completed the SRJ will be allowed to invest up to US$50 million or&#13;
27% of the loan on the infrastructure and equipment component, mainly on rolling stock. The term&#13;
"concession" means the transfer of operational and maintenance responsibilities of the Flumitrens&#13;
System to a Consortium including the enactment and execution of all legal, contractual and&#13;
administrative acts and documents required under the legislation of the State and of the Guarantor for&#13;
these purposes. If the first attempt at concessioning out the system fails for reasons beyond the control&#13;
of SRJ, the Borrower will attempt again to concession out the system and have a concession signed not&#13;
later than December 31, 1999. In the meantime , the Bank may authorize SRJ to invest up to 50% of the&#13;
loan, mainly on rolling stock, as long as SRJ/Flumitrens outsource the maintenance of rolling stock and&#13;
the fare collection to the private sector and comply with the targets for availability of rolling stock,&#13;
interval between trains and the operating subsidy provided in Table 2.3. If by December 31, 1999, no&#13;
concession has been signed and the targets agreed were not met, the Bank may cancel the remainder of&#13;
the loan.&#13;

F. Procurement                        Certification and Payment Process&#13;
3.2           All project components financed  1. The concessionaire seeks the approval of&#13;
under the proposed Bank loan would be procured     Flumitrens to begin the agreed work by submitting&#13;
in  accordance  with  Bank's  Guidelines  for      a Service Order, which includes details of the&#13;
Procurement (January 1995, Revised January and     implementation, benchmarks for gauging&#13;
progress, and a payment schedule linked to the&#13;
August 1996). The works and goods included in the   benchmarks.&#13;
project would be procured in two packages. The&#13;
first is for a total amount of US$100 million  2. A Flumiltrens inspector is permanently assigned to&#13;
equivalent for the infrastructure and equipment    the work and is responsible for measuring the&#13;

potential bidders. Therefore, in accordance with  6. At the conclusion of the work, the concessionaire&#13;
paragraph 3.13 (a) of the procurement guidelines,  recovers the five percent withheld amount.&#13;
works and goods specified in the concession&#13;
bidding documents would be procured from eligible&#13;
sources using the procedures of the concessionaire. Payments would be made to the concessionaire, as&#13;
detailed in the adjoining box.&#13;
3.3           Procurement procedures would be as follows:&#13;
(a)    contracts for goods estimated to cost more than US$350,000 equivalent, and&#13;
contracts for works including civil works, systems, permanent way and rolling&#13;
stock, estimated to cost more than US$5.0 million equivalent, would be procured&#13;
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with&#13;
Bank guidelines. The procurement of some goods valued below US$350,000&#13;
could be through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$0.5 million;&#13;
(b)    works of US$5.0 million equivalent or Iless, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$37.1 million (Table 3.1) would be aEwarded through NCB procedures. In&#13;
addition: (i) project components such as, civil works and systems, permanent&#13;
way, and rolling stock have been packaged and would be procured under supply&#13;
and installation procedures; and (ii) pre-qualification procedures would be&#13;
followed for the procurement of the signaling component; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(c)    consultants, which are expected to aggregate to about US$16.2 million&#13;
(including supervision of investment under the project), would be selected and&#13;
engaged following the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers (January 1997) and using the Bank's standard form of contract.&#13;
3.4           All procurement aspects were confirmed during negotiations, in particular the use of: (a)&#13;
standard bidding documents for NCB procedures for the procurement of goods or civil works satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank; and (b) the standard form contract for consulting services issued by the Bank. The&#13;
procurement schedule for major contracts is shown in Annex 8.&#13;
3.5           Procurement Review. All contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of&#13;
US$350,000 or more, and all contracts for works estimated to cost US$5.0 million or more, would be&#13;
subject to the Bank's prior review of the procurement documentation (advertising, bidding documents,&#13;
bid evaluation and contract award). The total value of these contracts would be US$326.9 million or&#13;
about 88 percent of all Bank-financed goods and civil works. The types of procurement and prior review&#13;
thresholds are summarized in Table 3.2. Flumitrens' management has the capabilities to handle&#13;
adequately the procurement processes required for this project. Procurement information would be&#13;
recorded as follows: (a) prompt reporting of contract award by the borrower; and (b) comprehensive&#13;
semiannual reports to the Bank by the borrowers, indicating: (i) revised cost estimates for individual&#13;
contracts and the total project, including best estimates of allowances for physical and price&#13;
contingencies; (ii) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract awards,&#13;
and completion time for individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified&#13;
methods of procurement.&#13;

G. Disbursement and Special Account&#13;
3.6               All disbursements under contracts of less than UIS$5.0 million equivalent for works, such&#13;
as systems, permanent way, and assembly of rolling stock, and of less than US$350,000 equivalent for&#13;
goods would be made on the basis of certified statements of expenditures (SOEs) prepared by&#13;
Flumitirens. SOE limits for consultant service contracts would bie US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000&#13;
for individuals. Supporting documentation for the SOEs woulcl be retained by Flumitrens and made&#13;
available for examination by Bank staff during supervision missions. To expedite project execution, a&#13;
Special Account would be opened in a commercial bank under terms and conditions acceptable to the&#13;
Bank with an authorized allocation of up to US$6.0 million equivalent. This account would be replenished&#13;
for the amount of withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures. Authorization is sought for retroactive&#13;
financing of up to US$18.6 million equivalent (10 percent of loan funds) in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
standard guidelines. This retroactive financing would be for expenditures made after January 1, 1997, or&#13;
twelve months before the signing of the loan, whichever is later and cover items such as the preparation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
of final engineering designs which must be carried out to complete the project preparation (Annex 5).&#13;
Claims for retroactive financing would have to be made no later three months after loan effectiveness.&#13;
The disbursement arrangements were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations. Table 3.3&#13;
presents the percentage to be disbursed by loan category.&#13;
H. Auditing&#13;
3.7          Flumitrens or its successor would prepare financial statements, the Special Account&#13;
audits, and SOEs audits using external auditors acceptable to the Bank. The Bank would review the&#13;
external auditors' terms of reference. Flumitrens would review the audit and report to the Bank on the&#13;
status and any remedial actions taken, if required. Flumitrens audit reports would be presented to the&#13;
Bank no later than April 30 of each year. The project auditing arrangements were discussed and agreed&#13;
upon during negotiations. The State and Flumitrens are familiar with the Bank's auditing procedures and&#13;
have the financial capacity to manage funds. Flumitrens has been submitting its audited accounts under&#13;
Ln. 3633-BR.&#13;
1. Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
3.8          Annual Review and Project Plan of Action. In November of each year, the Bank and&#13;
the SRJ would conduct a formal joint review of the progress made in reaching the objectives and in the&#13;
implementation of the proposed project. The annual review would provide an opportunity to discuss&#13;
project issues, in particular: compliance with covenants; technical assistance; institutional development&#13;
advancements and performance of Flumitrens; execution and analysis of further needs of the training&#13;
program; the quality of subproject implementation, including environmental analyses; implementation of&#13;
studies, sector policies and actions; and the implementation of a monitoring program (proposed&#13;
monitoring indicators are presented in Annex 11). The discussion and analysis of the issues addressed&#13;
during the year under review would lead to the formulation of adjustments and, if necessary, remedial&#13;
actions satisfactory to the Bank. The timing and scope of the annual review were confirmed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
3.9          The project places great emphasis on institutional development in the sector and as&#13;
such, implementation must be closely monitored and evaluated. It is proposed that a Mid-term Review of&#13;
the project be held 24 months after loan effectiveness. At the review, the performance of the project&#13;
would be assessed and the second period implementation program would be amended as necessary&#13;
based on the results of that evaluation. A review will take place one year after effectiveness to evaluate&#13;
the concession process. If there is a failure to concession Flumitrens for valid reasons, this mid-term&#13;
review would recommend other options to increase private sector participation.&#13;
3.10         Reporting. It was agreed during appraisal, and was confirmed at negotiations, that&#13;
Flumitrens with the assistance of participating operating agencies, would prepare biannual progress&#13;
reports on June 30 and December 31 of each year and submit them within 60 days. The reports would&#13;
cover past institutional development and project execution achievements and compare them with the&#13;
appraisal projections and goals set forth in the Action Plan (Annex 11). They would present a critical&#13;
assessment of problems and issues arising during project execution. The reports would also discuss&#13;
compliance with dated covenants and other conditions by each agency and actions taken to enforce&#13;
compliance. In cases of unsatisfactory progress, the reports would also describe proposals for&#13;
adjustments and remedial actions. The case for more periodic (quarterly) reporting would be reviewed at&#13;
the Mid-term Review. To facilitate adequate monitoring of the project, Flumitrens has agreed to install no&#13;
later than 90 days after loan signing a management information system to track the physical, financial&#13;
and environmental status of each component of the project.&#13;
J. Project Supervision&#13;
3.11         The responsibilities for supervising project implementation and a supervision plan are&#13;
shown in Annex 11. It is expected that at least three supervision missions per year staffed by an urban&#13;
transport engineer/planner, a railway engineer, a metro infrastructure engineer, and a financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
analystitransport economist would be required to supervise the proposed project during the first three&#13;
years of execution. In addition, specialists in resettlement, traffic engineering, air quality and&#13;
procurement would accompany the supervision missions as required. Supervision requirements are&#13;
expected to be intensive, particularly in the initial years, as Bank missions would aim to visit every&#13;
operating agency at least once a year. For the first three years, the supervision requirements are&#13;
estimated at about 15-staff weeks, reducing to 13-staff weeks in the fourth year, and 12-staff weeks in&#13;
the fifth, sixth and seventh years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;

and Project Agreements to assess project performance and progress on the concession, and&#13;
as necessary, agree on remedial actions. Particular importance would be given, during the&#13;
Mid-term Review, to the agreed working ratios and the status of the studies and action plans&#13;
required to ensure a smooth transfer of Flumitrens (para. 3.6); and&#13;
(m) Flumitrens non-operating assets: the SRJ and Flumitrens would undertake to establish a&#13;
department/division in charge of managing the non-operating assets of Flumitrens which&#13;
would not be part of the system concessioned out to the concessionaire.&#13;
4.5          Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing of up to US$18.6 million equivalent (10&#13;
percent of loan funds) for expenditures made after January 1, 1997 (or one year before loan signing,&#13;
whichever is later) is recommended because certain project activities, such as preparation of final&#13;
engineering designs, technical assistance for the transition to the concession, and creating a project&#13;
management team would have to be undertaken immediately.&#13;
4.6          Recommendation. With the above Agreements and Conditions, the proposed project&#13;
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$186 million equivalent, to be repaid in 15 years, including a&#13;
grace period of three years, at the Bank's fixed interest rate for single currency loans in US$.&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
BANK ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN TRANSPORT SECTOR IN BRAZIL&#13;
AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.           This Annex outlines the Bank's past support for the Brazilian urban transport sector and&#13;
the experience gained. The lessons learned can be summarized as: (a) the coordination between the&#13;
three levels of government in urban transport should be dealt with very carefully at the project&#13;
preparation level and reviewed in detail during the Mid-term Project Review; (b) policy for the sector&#13;
should be strengthened to minimize distortions resulting from inefficient physical and financial&#13;
coordination between modes and to promote multi-modal integration; (c) the tariff levels should allow for&#13;
significant cost recovery of working costs and should be complemented by financing mechanisms which&#13;
cover the shortfall; (d) demand levels are often overestimated and should therefore be carefully&#13;
scrutinized; and (e) more attention should be given to the management of infrastructure maintenance.&#13;
A. First Urban Transport Project (Ln. 1563-BR, US$88 million, May 1978)&#13;
2.           Project Objectives. The objectives were to: (a) finance investments that would improve&#13;
urban transport services, with emphasis on the provision of public transport, especially to the poor; (b)&#13;
promote and support the development and implementation of aippropriate urban transport policies; and&#13;
(c) strengthen municipal, state, and federal capacity to prepare, appraise, and execute sound urban&#13;
transport projects.&#13;
3.           Project Content. The project was broad in scope and included traffic engineering and&#13;
management measures in central urban areas and at critical points, the introduction of exclusive bus&#13;
lanes and segregated busways, widening of critical links, or construction of missing links in the road&#13;
network, reorganization or construction of bus terminals, paving of bus routes in low-income areas, and&#13;
training, technical assistance and institutional strengthening to improve the delivery of transport services.&#13;
Project beneficiaries included five metropolitan regions (Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Belo&#13;
Horizonte and Salvador). Nine different agencies were involved in implementation and overall&#13;
coordination was the responsibility of the Brazilian Urban Transport Company (EBTU).&#13;
4.           Implementation Experience. The project experienced various delays due to: (a) lack of&#13;
institutional support to the cities from EBTU, and Govemment changes in 1979 which led to staff&#13;
changes in the various implementing agencies; (b) the preparation of final engineering designs and&#13;
tendering; (c) land acquisition; (d) availability of counterpart funds; (e) local level coordination; and (f)&#13;
quality control of the works. The closing date for the project was extended twice, resulting in the&#13;
implennentation period changing from three years to five years and nine months. This suggests that the&#13;
appraisal schedule estimate was overly optimistic. Even so, the implementation period was still&#13;
substantially shorter than both worldwide and LAC region profiles which were above eight years. The only&#13;
specific covenant not met was the one requiring the five municipalities to take the necessary steps to&#13;
revise the valuation for tax purposes of properties whose values had been affected by the project. In the&#13;
early stages of the project, EBTU staff were less forceful than expected in solving local problems and&#13;
bringing difficulties to the attention of decision-makers. It must be recognized, however, that EBTU was&#13;
in its formative stages. This was a first project for them and there was a learning process involved. As&#13;
part of this process, and in order to achieve institutional improvement, EBTU prepared several&#13;
operational manuals to assist in the appraisal and supervision processes. These manuals and the&#13;
experilence gained by EBTU (and the Bank) provided the basis for the development procedures applied&#13;
in the Third Urban Transport Project (1981), which did much to improve the quality and efficiency of&#13;
EBTU's operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-                                   ANNEX 1&#13;
5.            Results. The project was timely and helped to focus the Government's growing concern&#13;
about urban transport problems. The support given to the institutional development of EBTU, following its&#13;
creation in 1976, improved federal-level urban transport planning. The project was successful in&#13;
providing improved urban transport services, particularly public transport to serve the poor. The OED&#13;
concluded that "the project was successful in implementing some of the most imaginative and radical&#13;
bus priority measures carried out anywhere in the world. These experiences have relevance for Bank-&#13;
financed urban transport projects worldwide." The bus priority measures included the development of the&#13;
bus corridor concept. Bus corridors were designed to accommodate passenger demand levels which&#13;
were difficult to satisfy by conventional bus services. Schemes involved segregated busways introduced&#13;
into the existing road system, facilities for passengers and pedestrians, bus system reorganization&#13;
(usually trunk/feeder), traffic management measures and integrated bus fare systems. The project was&#13;
also generally successful in providing institutional support at the metropolitan region (MR) level where&#13;
there has been a significant improvement in the capacity of the agencies to tackle urban transport issues.&#13;
The success was most particularly noted in those cities in which plans for future urban transport&#13;
investments existed, not necessarily financed by the Bank, which provided the scope for continued&#13;
institutional support. Finally, the studies and institutional strengthening financed under the project,&#13;
coupled with the successful implementation of the physical components, have led to policy changes&#13;
affecting urban transport in Brazil as whole and, in particular, have resulted in increased emphasis on&#13;
public bus transport and greater attention to cost-effective policies of traffic management.&#13;
6.            Sustainability. Institutional, technical and financial resources are required to sustain the&#13;
types of investments included in the First Urban Transport Project. Although there were some&#13;
institutional and technical weaknesses, the project clearly provided support to strengthen EBTU and the&#13;
local agencies. In the case of EBTU, this support was continued in the Third Urban Transport Project.&#13;
The major constraint with respect to sustainability has been the lack of provision for cost recovery, or&#13;
other funds to cover maintenance of the physical schemes implemented under the project. The failure to&#13;
make provision for maintenance of the investments is seen in practically all the city projects.&#13;
7.            However, the project had a substantial institutional impact overall. It assisted EBTU at a&#13;
critical and formative stage of its development, by providing strong technical and financial support, which&#13;
enabled it to play a catalytic role in transport improvements in urban areas. EBTU subsequently took&#13;
increasing responsibility in the appraisal and supervision of Bank-financed urban transport projects, a&#13;
process which began with the five metropolitan regions included in the First Urban Transport Project, and&#13;
which culminated with full responsibility for appraisal and supervision of eleven of the fourteen urban&#13;
centers included in the Third Urban Transport Project.&#13;
8.            The institutional support resulting from the technical assistance and studies, coupled with&#13;
the experience gained generally from the successful implementation of the physical components&#13;
included in the First Urban Transport Project, have led to urban transport policy changes which affect&#13;
Brazil as a whole. These include more emphasis on traffic management, on the provision of public bus&#13;
transport, and on the functioning of coordinating bodies at the local level to implement urban transport&#13;
policy.&#13;
B. Second Urban Transport (Porto Alegre) Project (Ln. 1839-BR, US$159 million, June 1980)&#13;
9.            Project Objectives. The objectives were: (a) to establish a new company to own,&#13;
manage, and operate a suburban rail mass transit system on a commercial basis without operating&#13;
subsidies; (b) to achieve a significantly more efficient modal distribution of traffic and use of all transport&#13;
facilities in the metropolitan region's North-South corridor; and (c) to promote the development of&#13;
selected employment growth poles in the North-South corridor near urban railway stations.&#13;
10.           Project Content. The project consisted of the construction of a surface suburban rail&#13;
mass transit system using electric unit trains between the central business area in Porto Alegre and the&#13;
municipality of Sapucaia, 26.7 km to the north, the establishment of a new company to own, manage and&#13;
operate this service, and a complementary program of policies and studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-                                  ANNEX I&#13;
11.          Implementation  Experience. Despite some serious problems of procurement,&#13;
passenger services started in March 1985, one year after the originally planned starting date. The railway&#13;
company, TRENSURB, was successfully established and during the course of project implementation&#13;
changed its nature from a construction organization to a railway operating company. The project closing&#13;
date vvas extended once by one year, to December 31, 1986.&#13;
12.          Results. The Project Completion Report sums up well the principal lessons:&#13;
(a)   It is not sufficient for the railway service to be successfully implemented. The&#13;
success of the project depends upon the service attracting sufficient passengers&#13;
to make the investments economically viable and the railway profitable. This will&#13;
be highly contingent upon the resumption of economic growth in Porto Alegre&#13;
and in the evolution of the fares for the users of alternative transport modes. In&#13;
addition, the attractiveness of the system would be enhanced by the&#13;
implementation of the recommendations of the studies carried out under the&#13;
project (bus integration, car parking restrictions, etc.).&#13;
(b)    One major lesson to be learned from this project is that, in cases in which there&#13;
is a need for substantial policy decisions and the implementation of measures&#13;
involving different Government agencies subject to conflicting pressures, their&#13;
commitment should be realistically assessed during project preparation. The&#13;
steps to ensure that these policies are implemented on time should be carefully&#13;
identified at the same time. In the particular case of the Second Urban Transport&#13;
Project, a more detailed action program including specific policy implementation&#13;
targets and appropriate measures for its enforcement should have been agreed&#13;
upon during appraisal.&#13;
(c)    Regarding the original objective of TRENSURB covering its working costs, the&#13;
appraisal was unrealistic to expect that this would take place during the initial&#13;
operation period. Only after the system has demonstrated its reliability to the&#13;
users, will the application of a revenue maximizing policy be feasible. In the&#13;
meantime, TRENSURB should review its staff needs in order to streamline costs&#13;
and carry out a tariff study to determine the optimal user charges. The Bank&#13;
should closely follow-up the implementation of these tasks in the context of its&#13;
ongoing and future involvement in the sector and continue to impress upon the&#13;
Government the benefits to be gained from a financially healthy public enter-&#13;
prise as well as the existence of tools much more effective than transport&#13;
subsidies to achieve income distribution objectives.&#13;
C. Third Urban Transport Project (Ln. 1965-BR, US$90 million, March 1981)&#13;
13.          Project Objectives. The objectives were: (a) to improve the quality and efficiency of&#13;
EBTU's operations through changes in its structure, procedures, and staff allocation; (b) to improve&#13;
transport infrastructure and operations in 14 medium-sized cities and conurbations (AGLURB); and (c) to&#13;
pave bus routes in low-income areas in medium-sized cities, state capitals, and metropolitan regions&#13;
(termed PROPAV).&#13;
14.          Project Content. The project consisted of three subprojects: (a) the institutional&#13;
subproject included EBTU's reorganization, training, technical assistance and studies; (b) the AGLURB&#13;
subprcject consisted of the establishment and operation of an urban transport management unit in each&#13;
of the 14 cities and various components in low-cost improvements to existing urban transport&#13;
infrastructure, with emphasis on public transport operations and improvements of planning and operation&#13;
of urban transport infrastructure and services at the local level; and (c) the PROPAV subproject included&#13;
the paving of about 850 km of bus routes in low-income areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31-                                 ANNEX 1&#13;
15.          Implementation Experience. Project implementation delays were experienced as a&#13;
result of numerous political changes, limited counterpart funds, the transfer of EBTU to the Minisftrio de&#13;
Desenvolvimento Urbano (MDU) from the Ministfrio dos Transportes (MT) and, soon thereafter, the&#13;
Federal Government's Economic Package, which delayed the signing of the 1986 Convenios by about&#13;
six months. The project was amended twice, which included the addition of four cities to the AGLURB&#13;
subproject and of 350 km of bus routes in low-income areas to the PROPAV subproject, and resulted&#13;
also in an extension in the implementation period from four years and three months to five years and&#13;
nine months. EBTU was in compliance with all loan covenants.&#13;
16.          Results. The AGLURB subproject has done much to create a realistic and effective&#13;
transport planning environment in Brazilian medium-sized conurbations. The design of the physical&#13;
components drew heavily on the successful experience of the First Urban Transport Project. Emphasis of&#13;
the project was placed on cost-effective, traffic management-based schemes in which assistance to&#13;
public transport (buses) has been the primary objective in the majority of components. The institutional&#13;
development.of the AGLURB areas was achieved through the establishment of management units&#13;
specifically to coordinate project implementation. Transport companies were formed to coordinate&#13;
transport planning and operation. Retention of the management units would depend on decisions by&#13;
individual cities, but selected personnel would be transferred from the management units to the transport&#13;
companies. At the time of project completion, the implementation delays arising from the political,&#13;
financial, and organizational factors meant that comprehensive ex-post evaluations were not yet&#13;
available. As with the First Urban Transport Project, there is a risk that the institutional gains may not be&#13;
sustained unless a flow of funds is made available to AGLURB cities to continue purposeful transport&#13;
planning.&#13;
17.          The PROPAV  program  was innovative and was a significant step in EBTU's&#13;
development. PROPAV was essentially a subsectoral component and EBTU was responsible for all&#13;
aspects of the program. The program utilized local materials and labor-intensive construction methods to&#13;
the maximum practical extent, with the result that the costs were initially overestimated. This permifted a&#13;
greater than targeted program to be undertaken, and to date all 850 km of paving have been&#13;
implemented. The PROPAV program is regarded as a highly successful program. To an extent, the&#13;
success of the program is demonstrated by the fact that similar paving programs have been undertaken&#13;
in other countries in Latin America.&#13;
18.          The institutional strengthening comprised two main aspects: (a) EBTU reorganization;&#13;
and (b) training and studies. The reorganization of EBTU proposed under the Third Project was&#13;
completed in 1984. In general, the reorganization was judged to have increased EBTU's effectiveness.&#13;
However, with the changing demands arising from federal government policy on decentralization and&#13;
from the needs of the Fourth Urban Transport Project, additional changes were considered necessary.&#13;
19.          The training program comprised a conventional approach (of courses, seminars, etc.) to&#13;
transport planners and an imaginative training program for bus operators and personnel. The latter&#13;
program has been successful in lowering bus operating costs, reducing accidents, and improving public&#13;
acceptability for bus services.&#13;
20.          The general delays in project implementation affected the commencement of the studies&#13;
proposed for inclusion in the project. Furthermore, EBTU did not initially give high priority to the studies.&#13;
However, in the last year of the project, the study program was revised and additionally provided inputs&#13;
to the preparation of the Fourth Urban Transport project. In particular, the Financial Study enabled EBTU&#13;
to form a policy for on-lending, the vehicle operating cost study (carried out by GEIPOT) provided data&#13;
for incorporation in the EBTU Operations Manual (OM), and the bus information system program&#13;
(SITURB) furnished an initial data base for evaluating bus operating costs.&#13;
D. Fourth Urban Transport Project (Ln. 2822-BR, US$200 million, May 1987)&#13;
21.          Project Objectives. The objectives were: (a) improve the operating efficiency of the&#13;
urban transport systems in the nine metropolitan regions (MRs) through savings in transport costs and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-                                  ANNEX I&#13;
time; (b) seek to pass savings from improvements in the urban transport systems on to users, many of&#13;
whom were among the urban poor, in the form of lower tariffs and/or improved levels of service; (c)&#13;
conserve energy and encourage substitution of diesel fuel by promotion of domestic energy sources,&#13;
wherever economically justified; (d) strengthen the role of financial aspects in urban transport policy; (e)&#13;
strengthen the major institutions, in particular for coordinated investment planning for the sector as a&#13;
wholle; and (f) increase the responsiveness of transport planning to local needs.&#13;
22.          Project Content. The proposed project would have financed components selected from&#13;
EBTU's rolling urban transport investment plan (1986-1990) in Brazil's nine MRs (Belo Horizonte, Belem,&#13;
Curitiba, Fortaleza, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Sgo Paulo). Components would&#13;
include a Corridor Program, comprising investments, including design and supervision, to improve&#13;
public transportation (mainly bus systems, but also some trolley bus and ferry systems) and to correct&#13;
wealcnesses in road networks. The Corridor Program would include infrastructure (including extensive&#13;
rehabilitation and reconstruction), traffic management measures and supporting organizational&#13;
improvements; and a system-wide Maintenance Program, including civil works, equipment, the&#13;
establishment of maintenance management systems, and institutional strengthening. The project would&#13;
also finance a sector-wide Institutional Program which would involve EBTU, MRs, MDU, and CBTU.&#13;
This component would include technical assistance and training for improved planning and operational&#13;
practices, studies and organizational measures to strengthen and improve sector coordination, financial&#13;
planining and urban transport policy development and pilot technological development programs.&#13;
23.          Results. There was a considerable delay in cleclaring the project effective. Institutional&#13;
problems at the level of the Federal Government resulted in a very poor environment for the project's&#13;
implementation. The Fourth Urban Transport Project was canceled when the EBTU was abolished by the&#13;
Government in 1989.&#13;
E. Sao Paulo Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3457-BR, US$126 million,&#13;
September 1992)&#13;
24.          This project was signed in September 1992, became effective in February 1993, and its&#13;
closiing date is June 30, 1996. The project is underway and several major institutional hurdles, such as a&#13;
federal law to transfer the assets of the railway from the Federal to the State, have been overcome. The&#13;
rehalbilitation of CBTU-SP, the Sao Paulo subdivision of the CBTU, is underway. S3o Paulo established&#13;
a new company (CPTM) to take over the decentralized CBTIJ-SP and also the FEPASA metropolitan&#13;
train. So far, the main problems of the project have been associated with problems at the Federal level,&#13;
incluiding delays in the opening of special accounts, and several changes in ministers and their&#13;
immediate advisors. These constant changes delayed the signing of 'convOnios' which regulate the&#13;
transfer of operations and assets. The actual takeover of CBTU by CPTM took place on May 27, 1994.&#13;
The project is now disbursing very well and some of the infrastructure and equipment components have&#13;
been completed. As of June 17, 1997, 85 percent of the total project cost had been disbursed and the&#13;
study to evaluate concession options for CPTM is underway.&#13;
F. Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3633-BR, US$128.5 million,&#13;
October 1993)&#13;
25.          This project was signed in October 1993 and became effective on March 14, 1993. Most&#13;
of the bids for track work and rolling stock rehabilitation are underway. The actual decentralization which&#13;
involves the takeover of CBTU-Rio de Janeiro by the State and of the Metro by the Municipality of Rio&#13;
de Janeiro took place on January 1, 1995. As of June 17, 1997 the project had disbursed 67 million or&#13;
52% of the loan. Most of the contracts have been awarded but there have been delays in the delivery of&#13;
the rehabilitated rolling stock. The project was instrumental in financing studies which evaluated the&#13;
optioins for the concession of the Flumitrens system and of the Rio de Janeiro Metro System.&#13;

G. Recife Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3915-BR, US$102 million, June&#13;
1995)&#13;
26.          This project was signed on April 3, 1996 and became effective on September 19, 1996 .&#13;
The delays between board approval and effectiveness were mainly due to internal politics. The actual&#13;
decentralization which involves the takeover of CBTU-Recife by the State is scheduled for August 31,&#13;
1997. As of June 17, 1997 the project had disbursed 2.28 million or 2.2% of the loan. Most of the&#13;
contracts related to station integration have been awarded but there have been delays in the processing&#13;
of the major track contracts because the Pernambuco Environmental Agency was too slow in issuing the&#13;
environmental licenses to build. The project is expected to disburse at least US$10 million in the first&#13;
quarter of FY98.&#13;
H. Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3916-BR, US$99 million,&#13;
June 1995)&#13;
27.          This project was signed on November 30, 1995 and became effective on April 19, 1996.&#13;
The delays between board approval and effectiveness were mainly due to the slowness of the approval&#13;
process by the Brazilian Senate. The actual decentralization which involves the takeover of CBTU-BH by&#13;
the State is scheduled for December 31, 1997. As of June 17, 1997 the project had disbursed 7.6 million&#13;
or 7.68% of the loan. Most of the major track and station contracts have been awarded in June 1997 and&#13;
resettlement is proceeding satisfactorily. The project is expected to disburse at least US$15 million in the&#13;
first quarter of FY98. A study to evaluate options for concession of the system will soon be signed.&#13;
G. Conclusions and Lessons Learned&#13;
28.          Despite the considerable achievements of the First Urban Transport Project and the&#13;
success of the Third Urban Transport Project, the projects have led to the conclusion that several&#13;
specific issues in the urban transport sector require attention and should be addressed within the context&#13;
of overall sector reform. The main issues are discussed below.&#13;
29.          Cost Recovery. Direct cost recovery is difficult in the urban transport sector, other than&#13;
for self-financing infrastructure and passenger vehicles and vessels. Therefore, transportation&#13;
infrastructure investments (urban and interurban) conventionally recover costs indirectly through&#13;
transport-related taxes. In the First Urban Transport Project, it was envisaged that partial cost recovery&#13;
would take place by the revaluation of properties whose values were affected by the project. No such&#13;
revision in valuation, however, has apparently taken place in any of the five Metropolitan Regions (MRs),&#13;
partly because of the difficulties in assessing an increase in property values through the low-cost&#13;
improvement schemes provided under the project, when alternative policies or conditions encourage the&#13;
provision of essential municipal infrastructure, at little or no cost to the beneficiaries. In retrospect, the&#13;
project should have also addressed the indirect cost recovery mechanisms.&#13;
30.          Maintenance. Lack of maintenance is clearly a problem in each of the five MRs in the&#13;
First Project, and is now apparent in the components implemented early in the Third Urban Transport&#13;
Project. Problems apply to a wide range of components. Maintenance covenants were included in the&#13;
agreements for both projects, but this has proved an ineffective mechanism for ensuring adequate&#13;
maintenance levels. While there is increasing awareness of the problem and while improved&#13;
maintenance standards are an objective of the Federal Government, there is a need to develop an&#13;
institutional and financial framework and capability to provide the necessary funding and to carry out the&#13;
appropriate maintenance. In hindsight, this problem probably reflects the limitation of addressing narrow&#13;
sectoral issues, in isolation of a broader policy framework for the urban sector as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-                                  ANNEX 1&#13;
H. Lessons Learned and the Rio de Janeiro Mass Transit Project&#13;
31.          The proposed urban transport project is the eighth to be considered in Brazil. Thus, there&#13;
is considerable "in-country" experience to draw upon. In addition, the design of the proposed project has&#13;
attempted to recognize the findings and experience from simillar projects outlined in this Annex. The&#13;
main fieatures of the proposed project which respond to the lessons learned are described in the following&#13;
paragraphs.&#13;
32.          Institutions. A successful institutional arrangernent will be the key to project success&#13;
and project sustainability. In the past in Brazil, there has been little incentive for cities/municipalities to&#13;
undertake cost-effective transport planning and investment. Cities have been starved of resources for&#13;
transport investment. The creation of the AMTU-RJ will be a major advance. In addition to insuring that&#13;
major lprojects are in line with an approved integrated air quality, land use and urban transport strategy,&#13;
AMTU-RJ's key role will be to facilitate service and tariff integiration between the several modes. It is&#13;
expected that no urban transport project in the RJMR will be considered in the future by the Bank without&#13;
prior approval by the AMTU-RJ.&#13;
33.          To further support the long-term development of traffic and transport planning, the&#13;
project will include funding for the preparation of an Integrated Air Quality, Land Use and Urban&#13;
Transport strategy and the updating of the metropolitan data base. Staff from participating implementing&#13;
agencies will benefit from this work.&#13;
34.          Counterpart Funding. In Brazil, lack of timely counterpart funding is often the main&#13;
cause of delays in project implementation. Several steps were taken to mitigate this problem. The&#13;
Goverrior, as a condition of negotiations, will indicate in writing that in case of scarcity of counterpart&#13;
funds the proposed project will have priority over other transport projects. Although an analysis of the&#13;
State finances reveals that the sources of funds exist, the challenge will be to ensure that they are&#13;
available when the system is decentralized.&#13;
35.          Implementation Schedule. Long implementation, and thus slow disbursements, have&#13;
been problems in previous projects. This may be traced to:&#13;
(a)    Lack of familiarity of local staff with Bank procedures. A training program  is&#13;
proposed but training programs take time for benefits to be realized and, even then,&#13;
there is no substitute for practical application. CBTU's PIU has gained considerable&#13;
experience with the ongoing Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Recife, and Rio de Janeiro&#13;
Metropolitan Transport Decentralization loans (Lns. 3457-BR and 3633-BR). Flumitrens&#13;
PMIG is capitalizing on that experience and is using approved bidding documents and&#13;
TORs to gain time.&#13;
(b)    Uncertain political commitment. The establishrnent of the AMTU-RJ gives grounds for&#13;
confidence that all levels of govemment of the metropolitan region are committed to the&#13;
project. During preparation the level of support was excellent.&#13;
(c)    Lack of final engineering designs for physicall works. It is proposed that participating&#13;
agencies should have the first year of final engineering designs (including bidding&#13;
documents) available at negotiations.&#13;
36.          Environment. In the past, urban transport projects with the exception of the Mexico&#13;
Transport Air Quality Management Project (Ln. 3543-ME) and the Teheran Transport Emissions&#13;
Reduction Project (TF 028642-GET) have had few or no specific measures to improve air quality project.&#13;
The proposed project contains an Air Quality and Traffic Safety component which together with the&#13;
infrastructure components is expected to set the foundation for further development in these areas in the&#13;
Rio de Janeiro Mass Transit Project.&#13;

PROJECT COORDINATION AND EXECUTING AGENCIES&#13;
1.            The overall coordination and supervision of the proposed project rests with Flumitrens which has&#13;
established a Project Management and Implementation Group (PMIG). To assist Flumitrens to carry out its&#13;
obligations, the PMIG will be supported by a Project Management and Implementation Consultant (PMIC).&#13;
Flumitrens will be the implementing agency for all components but will be helped in some cases by the State&#13;
Secretariats of Transport, Planning and Environment.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RIO DE JANEIRO MASS TRANSIT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT METROPOLITAN AGENCY&#13;
A. The Establishment and Role of a Urban Transport Metropolitan Agency (AMTU-RJ)&#13;
1.           The Metropolitan Regions (MRs) in Brazil were created by the complementary law&#13;
number 14, dated 6/8/73, with the aim to achieve metropolitan synergy, e.g., integrated planning for the&#13;
social and economical development, land use, sewerage, transportation, production and distribution of&#13;
utilities for domestic use, better use of water resources, and environmental pollution control. This federal&#13;
law created the following MRs: Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Recife, Salvador, Belem and&#13;
Fortaleza. The Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region (RJMR) was created later, by a similar Federal Law,&#13;
number 20, dated 7/1/74, along with the merger of the former states of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro.&#13;
2.           According to the 1969 Brazilian Constitution, the Federal Government was responsible&#13;
for establishing Metropolitan Regions. The present 1988 Constitution transferred such authority to State&#13;
Governments. In 1990, the Government of the State of Rio de Janeiro reconstituted the RJMR. It now&#13;
includes the following municipalities: Rio de Janeiro, Belford Roxo, Duque de Caxias, Guapimirim,&#13;
Itaborai, ltaguai, Japeri, Mage, Mangaratiba, Marica, Nil6polis, Niter6i, Nova Iguarcu, Paracambi,&#13;
Queimados, S3o Gon9alo and Sao Joao do Meriti. These municipalities integrate the "organization,&#13;
planning, and execution of public functions, and share common public services."&#13;
3.           The law stipulates that the Integrated Planning for the Metropolitan Region will share 'the&#13;
definition of the policies for: development, land use, urban growth, industrial plant location, dwelling,&#13;
tourism, pollution, environment control, sewerage, culture preservation and protection, as well as for&#13;
mass transit, including the permission, concession, authorization and scheduling for transit systems,&#13;
transfer stations for passenger and cargo."&#13;
4.           The MRs are managed by a Deliberative Council composed by the following members:&#13;
* all mayors;&#13;
* one county deputy selected by each municipality;&#13;
* five members of the State House of Representatives;&#13;
* five members of the executive power, nominated by the Governor and chosen from&#13;
the Secretariat;&#13;
* one member of the community, nominated by the Governor;&#13;
* one member of the Civil Society, nominated by the Governor;&#13;
* the president of the council is the Governor.&#13;
5.           The MRs have the following attributions:&#13;
* to submit to the State House of Representatives the Metropolitan Master Plan;&#13;
* to exercise normative power concerning: integrated planning, the organization and&#13;
execution of common shared services;&#13;
* to define the parameters of the financial compensation from the municipalities which&#13;
compose the MR;&#13;
* to create rules for the State and municipalities concerning the concession, permission&#13;
and authorization of public function activities;&#13;
* to establish the guidelines for a tariff policy for public services.&#13;
6.           According to the Law, the State must exercise, through an entity under the executive&#13;
branch, the functions necessary to execute the Master Plans, Programs and Projects of the MR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-                                   ANNEX3&#13;
7.           The necessary resources to make the MR function will be assured by the State and the&#13;
municipalities through the Accounting Fund for the Development of The Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan&#13;
Region, aimed at financing projects and programs, designated the Metropolitan Fund for Development.&#13;
8.           To facilitate coordination of investment and operation among the major providers of&#13;
urban transport services, the proposal to create a regional coordinating body is being given priority. This&#13;
would not be a new level of government and would not usurp the powers of the state or the municipality.&#13;
It would provide a forum, however, to formally review all proposals with respect to their compliance with&#13;
an agreied-upon transport strategy, evaluate alternatives, and make recommendations based on a&#13;
regional, intermodal point of view. This entity would be termed the Urban Transport Metropolitan Agency&#13;
of Rio die Janeiro (AMTU-RJ). The AMTU-RJ will include representatives of the Governor of the State&#13;
and mayors of the RJMR, in particular the Mayor of the Rio de Janeiro Municipality, as well as&#13;
SECTRAN, Flumitrens, Metr6, CONERJ, bus operator associations, and those agencies responsible for&#13;
municipal and regional planning. An executive secretariat in charge of actually developing and/or&#13;
evaluating proposals and carrying out day-to-day activities would be established. The AMTU-RJ would&#13;
be responsible for developing an integrated urban transport and alir quality strategy for the RJMR that is&#13;
compatible with the land-use policies jointly developed with the land-use agencies of the RJMR.&#13;
9.           The following questions must be asked when defining the functions of the AMTU-RJ: (a)&#13;
~how are itransport plans prepared, and how often are they updated? Is a single entity responsible for their&#13;
preparation across all modes (highways, metro, suburban rail, bus/busways) and the entire region, or are&#13;
separate plans prepared by the respective municipalities, building and operating companies and then put&#13;
together by a coordinating agency? (b) who monitors the condition and performance of the transport&#13;
systems, and how do the results of the monitoring feed into the planning process? (c) what is the&#13;
relationship between the transport plan(s) and the respective! land-use plans developed by the&#13;
municipalities? (d) what is the relationship between the plan(s) developed under question (a) above, and&#13;
the multi-year capital program developed by the various implementing authorities? Is the project flow&#13;
top-down (i.e., emanates from the plan), bottom-up (generated by the implementers/operators), or both?&#13;
and (e) do the various operating companies have direct access to funding or should their capital budgets&#13;
be approved either by the SECTRAN-RJ or the new AMTU-RJ?&#13;
10.          At the suggestion of the Bank, SECTRAN and 'Secretary of Transport of the Rio de&#13;
Janeiro Municipality have signed an implementation agreement (protocolo de inten,6es) in order to&#13;
create the AMTU-RJ, and with the support of Flumitrens, it has launched studies to define the role,&#13;
responsibilities, composition and funding of the AMTU-RJ.&#13;
B. AMTU-RJ's Proposed Structure, Composition and Role&#13;
11.          The general structure of an entity in charge of coordinating transport policy, prioritizing&#13;
major investments, and defining air quality and traffic safety objectives and policies pertaining to urban&#13;
transport in the 17 municipalities that make up the RJMR is outlined below. This annex highlights the&#13;
basic features of a proposed solution which attempts to comply with the objectives described above.&#13;
12.          Institutional Background. The RJMR comprises 17 independent municipalities, each&#13;
with its own mayor and municipal council (camara de vereadores), of which the Municipality of Rio de&#13;
Janeiro (prefeitura), also the state capital, is by far the largest and most important from the economic&#13;
and political standpoints. The State Constitution indicates that public transport of regional interest is to be&#13;
planned and coordinated by the State Government together with thie municipalities involved. Such is the&#13;
case with many transport routes in the RJMR. In fact, even some transport services within the&#13;
boundaries of a specific municipality can be of regional interest and, as such, should be planned jointly.&#13;
C. Basic Concepts&#13;
13.           The key elements for the sustainability of the proposed coordination are as follows: (a) it&#13;
should be conceived as a permanent structure, designed to outlive executive or legislative mandate&#13;
periods; (b) it should be accepted by the parties as an additional asset and not as a threat to their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-                                   ANNEX3&#13;
autonomy or decision-making powers (even though the balance of power may, and probably will, shift at&#13;
its inception); (c) it will not interfere with jurisdictions which belong to those parties, notwithstanding the&#13;
fact that it will be granted a specific political status, and its own specific powers; and (d) it should not&#13;
assume the functions of a public company (empresa), nor should it be in charge of operations of any&#13;
kind. These conditions for long-term sustainability of an entity of this type may restrict the scope of work&#13;
to only a few basic functions, which will, however, constitute the basis upon which to develop further&#13;
coordinating responsibilities. Experience in other countries, such as that of the United States, indicates&#13;
that the planning function is the best support for actions aimed at transport coordination. Such planning&#13;
aims at the establishment of a fully integrated public transport system, and this concept should always be&#13;
present as a basic guideline for coordination proposals and for the implementation of the related&#13;
institutional framework.&#13;
14.          Within the planning function, priorities should be appropriately defined. Actions might&#13;
begin, for example, with investment policy and fare policy coordination, and later encompass physical&#13;
planning, traffic management, and system operations. Such phasing-in would be supported by a common&#13;
strategic vision of the metropolitan transport system. AMTU-RJ would have an important role in the&#13;
decision-making process regarding the transfer of transport-related funds from the state and federal&#13;
levels to the municipalities. Projects submitted to the World Bank and other multilateral agencies&#13;
should first be prioritized by the AMTU-RJ. It should be noted that granting such powers may be one&#13;
of the most difficult points to be agreed upon. If, however, the final investment decisions are left out from&#13;
AMTU-RJ attributes, AMTU-RJ would become little more than a forum for discussions (and eventual&#13;
decisions) on metropolitan transport matters, with little or no coordinating role. Budget control by AMTU-&#13;
RJ would be more naturally accepted by the parties involved, given a set of political mechanisms, such&#13;
as: (a) assuring an adequate balance between state and municipal points of view concerning planning&#13;
decisions; (b) active involvement of the Federal Government, considering that good transport&#13;
performance in large urban areas is to be viewed as a matter of national interest, and not only as a&#13;
concern of local government entities; and (c) implementation of a permanent planning process,&#13;
continuously incorporating relevant new information as it is made available, with emphasis on socio-&#13;
economic and environmental changes and proposed improvements to the transport system, always from&#13;
a strategic point of view.&#13;
15.          The state transport secretary would represent the state government and preside over the&#13;
executive secretariat. Also, operators companies would provide AMTU-RJ with the necessary technical&#13;
and administrative support. In the event that RJMR becomes a legally recognized entity, AMTU-RJ&#13;
would naturally be absorbed into a fuller metropolitan planning structure. The establishment of the&#13;
AMTU-RJ as a permanent body, as mentioned before, will require a search for the most suitable legal&#13;
framework. Also, AMTU-RJ components would be designed with that in mind, giving priority to stable&#13;
relations with all government levels, while maintaining sound political and technical supporting&#13;
structures. When the AMTU-RJ is established, existing bodies with related functions would be terminated&#13;
or absorbed into it.&#13;
16.           Highlights of the regimento intemo signed by the Secretary of Transport of Rio de&#13;
Janeiro Municipality and Secretary of Transport of the State (SECTRAN) are given below.&#13;
D. General Description of AMTU-RJ&#13;
17.          Objective. The Rio de Janeiro urban transportation metropolitan agency (AMTU-RJ) is&#13;
an entity that represents the State Government, the RJMR's municipalities, and all those institutions from&#13;
private or public nature, with the responsibility of planning, managing or operating public transport&#13;
systems in the RJMR, in order to ensure a metropolitan approach in studies, plans and investments in&#13;
transport sector, aiming at their integration with urban and environment plans.&#13;
18.          Composition. AMTU-RJ structure includes three bodies: (a) a deliberative council,&#13;
composed by the Secretary of Transport of the State of Rio de Janeiro who will act as the chairman or&#13;
president, the Secretary of Transport of the Municipality of RJ, who will act as the vice-president, five&#13;
mayors representing RJMR's subregions, the president of the planning institute of RJ municipality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(IPLAN Rio), the president of Flumitrens, the president of Meltr6, the president of road transportation&#13;
department (DETRO), the president of CETRAN, the president of the private road operators association,&#13;
the president of BNDES, and a representative of users association entity; (b) an executive committee,&#13;
whose chairman will be the representative of the Secretary of Transport of the State; and (c) a technical&#13;
commiittee, as an advisory and support technical secretariat, composed of representatives from public&#13;
transport companies and bus operators, with the role of dealing with selected items affecting city and&#13;
state. Representatives from other areas or agencies and indepiendent professionals may be invited for&#13;
discussion on specific issues.&#13;
19.           Municipal Subregions. For representative purposes, the RJMR has been split into five&#13;
subregions, considering the main transportation corridors. Each group will deliberate about transport and&#13;
traffic management issues within their respective areas, and will elect a mayor to represent it at the&#13;
executive committee.&#13;
* Subregion A: Nova Igua,ci Municipality;&#13;
* Subregion B: Paracambi, Japeri, Queimados, Mangaratiba, Itaguai and Seropedica;&#13;
* Subregion C: Nil6polis, SAo Joao de Meriti and Belford Roxo;&#13;
* Subregion D: Mage, Guapimirim and Duque de Caxias; and&#13;
* Sub,region E: Itaborai, Sao Goncalo, Marica, Niter6i and Tangua.&#13;
20.          Attributes. The role of AMTU-RJ will be to: (a) plan, coordinate and suggest to all&#13;
govemiment levels the priority of investments in transport, taking into account economic efficiency and&#13;
financial sustainability and the environmental and land-use questions; (b) propose integrated alternatives&#13;
of transport between different systems and modes; (c) propose the fare guidelines for transportation&#13;
systems in the RJMR; (c) propose standards and rules concerning the planning and integration of the&#13;
systems; (d) make compatible guidelines concerning licenses and permissions; and (e) establish criteria&#13;
and to monitor the costs and evaluate the performance of the different systems.&#13;
21.           The role of the deliberative council will be to: (a) deliberate about metropolitan&#13;
transportation, its political and strategic aspects; (b) define objectives, guidelines and standards; (c)&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
INCREASING PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE RJMR URBAN TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
1.           In this section we describe the urban transport sector in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan&#13;
Region, the main state agencies involved in the provision of urban transport services, the institutional&#13;
framework of the sector and the major reforms sought in the proposed project.&#13;
A. SECTRAN and Its Agencies&#13;
2.           Since most of the urban transport component deals with the agencies which are&#13;
subordinated to the Secretary of Transport of RJ (SECTRAN), a summary description of those agencies&#13;
and of SECTRAN is provided in the next paragraphs and summarized in Table 4.1.&#13;
3.           SECTRAN is responsible for policy setting, regulation and supervision of all public and&#13;
freight transport in the State which crosses municipal boundaries. In addition, it is also responsible for rail&#13;
suburban transport in the RJMR, ferry boat services in the Guanabara, Sepetiba and liha Grande bays,&#13;
and for the Rio de Janeiro Metro. SECTRAN has a staff of 330 ernployees (166 in the operational areas&#13;
and 164 in administrative functions) and is organized as a traditional transport ministry with departments&#13;
dealing with Passenger Transport, Freight Transport, Special Projects, Transport Engineering and&#13;
General Administration in addition to divisions in charge of technical and legal support to the Secretary&#13;
and the IJndersecretary. SECTRAN is not responsible for road infrastructure which is under the Secretary&#13;
of Public Works. The main agencies subordinated to SECTRAN are: (a) Companhia Fluminense de&#13;
Trens Urbanos (Flumitrens); (b) Companhia do Metropolitano do Rio de Janeiro (Metro); (c) Companhia&#13;
de Nave gaao do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (CONERJ); (d) Compwanhia de Desenvolvimento Rodovidrio&#13;
e Terminals (CODERTE); (e) Companhia de Transportes Coletivos do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (CTC);&#13;
(f) Empresa Estadual de Viagao (SERVE); and (g) Departamento de Transportes Rodovidrios do Estado&#13;
do Rio de Janeiro (DETRO). At the end of 1995, SECTRAN and ils agencies had a total staff of 15,942&#13;
employees of which 4,218 in administrative functions and 11,724 in operating functions. SECTRAN and&#13;
its agencies received subsidies totaling R$356.11 (US$371 million) in 1995.&#13;
4.           Flumitrens, the suburban rail company was, until December 1994, part of the federally-&#13;
owned Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos. In a Bank-financed decentralization program (Ln. 3633-&#13;
BR), the Federal Government agreed with the State that in return for investing US$272 million (of which&#13;
the Bank. loan amounted to US$128.5) in infrastructure and equipment of the system, the State would&#13;
assume the operational and financial responsibility of Flumitrens free of debt and would receive all the&#13;
assets of the company including land and terminals needed for operational purposes. The State saw in&#13;
this decentralization program an opportunity to better run the suburban rail system, to be more&#13;
responsive to the users, and to improve integration with the bus, subway and ferry system all under its&#13;
jurisdiction. As part of the agreement to receive the Flumitrens; system, the State had reached an&#13;
agreement for the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro (RJM) to take over the Metro. After two years of&#13;
negotiations, RJM decided not to take over the Metro. The State had, at that time to decide whether to&#13;
assume Flumitrens and continue with the Metro or to withdraw frorn the decentralization program. Since&#13;
as part of the decentralization program, the Federal Government would also absorb a US$2.8 billion debt&#13;
of the Metro with the Federal Government, that would allow the State to restart the Metro works which&#13;
had been halted in the last ten years as well as it would unblock other federal funding to the State, the&#13;
latter decided to continue with the decentralization program. The long negotiations between the State&#13;
and RJM, resulted in implementation delays of Ln. 3633-BR which affected the overall performance of&#13;
Flumitrens, particularly the condition of the train fleet which deteriorated very fast. The working subsidy&#13;
estimatecl at appraisal for 1994 was around US$80 million while the actual subsidy paid by the Federal&#13;
Government at that time was US$160 million, i.e., twice as much, mainly due to a drop in demand&#13;
caused by very poor train availability and very high fare evasion. To compensate for this deviation, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-                                  ANNEX 4&#13;
Federal Government agreed to meet a full year of payroll after decentralization (1995) to give time for&#13;
the State to restructure the system. However, during 1995, salary increases stipulated by federal&#13;
legislation combined with further deterioration of the train fleet and slow restructuring, increased the 1995&#13;
subsidy to US$188 million. In fact, 1996 is the first fiscal year in which the State is going to meet the&#13;
payroll of Flumitrens. During the mid-term review of Ln. 3633-BR, agreement has been reached in re-&#13;
allocating more funds for train rehabilitation and decrease the amounts spent in station rehabilitation.&#13;
This would bring the ridership to close to 900,000 passengers per day at the end of the project instead of&#13;
the projected 1.1 million forecast at appraisal. It is estimated, however, that a further investment of&#13;
US$373 million will be needed to bring Flumitrens infrastructure and equipment to a standard which is&#13;
attractive to private concessionaires and capable of serving 1.28 million passengers/day. This additional&#13;
investment is essentially (about 80 percent) for train rehabilitation.&#13;
5.           Flumitrens had at the end of 1995 (i.e., at the end of the first year under the State),&#13;
7,871 employees of which 826 in administration and 7,045 in operations. The tariff charged by the&#13;
system is at present US$0.42 which is much less than the competing intermunicipal buses (US$1.35).&#13;
Most of the users are low-income (1-2 minimum salaries/month) and therefore the government is&#13;
reluctant to raise the tariff which is traditionally set at 90 percent of the municipal bus fare. Despite their&#13;
low income, surveys show that users are willing to pay more if the service becomes more reliable and&#13;
frequent and that can only be achieved when the train fleet is rehabilitated. The State has decided that,&#13;
as part of a program to reduce Flumitrens subsidy, it will call for bids for a long-term concession of the&#13;
system to a private sector concessionaire which will operate and maintain the system at the lowest net&#13;
present value of cost to the Government over the period of concession. In the meantime it is expected&#13;
that the investments under Ln. 3633-BR plus investments to decrease the maintenance backlog will&#13;
improve train availability. Furthermore, the State has asked the Bank to evaluate a loan to finance the&#13;
additional US$373 million estimated to bring the system to a condition which will make it more attractive&#13;
to potential private sector concessionaires.&#13;
6.           Flumitrens employees contribute to a railway pension fund which complements the&#13;
social security pensions to which they are entitled. The ongoing staff downsizing program in Flumitrens&#13;
and the Metro is likely to affect the pension fund's capacity to repay its members since the laid-off&#13;
employees are entitled to withdraw their contributions.&#13;
7.           Flumitrens' subsidy per passenger in 1994 was US$1.558 while in Argentina the privately&#13;
run suburban rail system of Buenos Aires is US$0.32. The subsidy per car-km supplied by Flumitrens is&#13;
US$5.03 while in Buenos Aires it was US$1.03. Finally, paying passengers per staff in Flumitrens were&#13;
12,488 while in Buenos Aires were 42,860. These comparisons are only to suggest that restructuring of&#13;
Flumitrens through concessions may boost productivity and drastically reduce the subsidy per passenger.&#13;
8.           Metro operates only 2 lines, one of 11.6 km and 15 stations and another with 11.4 km&#13;
and 7 stations for a total of 23 km and 22 stations. Metro was always under the State responsibility and&#13;
its works have been halted since the beginning of the previous administration due to the inability of the&#13;
State to pay the debt service owed to the Federal Government. At the end of 1995, Metro had 3272&#13;
employees of which 1,842 in operations and 1,430 in administrative functions. This compares with the&#13;
Santiago de Chile Metro which with the same length operates with only 1300 employees and, with the&#13;
same tariff as the Metro (US$0.45) covers all its costs. Metro received a subsidy of R$109 million&#13;
(US$113.5 million) in 1995 and transported 73.1 million passengers. This subsidy is expected to increase&#13;
to US$120 million in 1996 if the system is not restructured. In 1995, Metro's subsidy per paying&#13;
passenger was US$1.34 and the subsidy per car-km supplied was US$12.21 compared respectively to&#13;
US$0.08 and US$0.60 in the Buenos Aires subway under private concession. The State was able to&#13;
secure a BNDES loan of US$298 million which together with State funds of US$198 will allow Metro to&#13;
extend its system to 35 km and finish works which had been halted since 1990. With these investments,&#13;
Metro expects to double its ridership to approximately one million passengers/day, and decrease its very&#13;
high subsidy. The State has also decided to have Metro managed by a private management and later on&#13;
by a concession as in Buenos Aires and intends to bring its subsidy to zero by the end of 1998.&#13;

9.           CONERJ operates the ferryboat system  between Rio/Niter6i, Rio/Paqueta and&#13;
Rio/Ribeira in the Guanabara Bay and the route between Mangaratiba/Abrago/Angra dos Reis in the&#13;
Sepetiba Bay. CONERJ also administers and operates the ferry terminals of Praga XV in Rio, Niter6i,&#13;
Paqueta, Ribeira, and also the docking quays in Mangaratiba, Abraao and Angra dos Reis. CONERJ has&#13;
19 ferries of which eleven have a 2,000 passenger capacity, four have a capacity of 1,000, two of 500,&#13;
two of 370 and 3 support vessels. In 1995, CONERJ had 1,097 employees of which 381 were in&#13;
administrative functions and 716 in operating functions. Most of the passengers (93 percent) are carried&#13;
in the Rio (Praga XV) -Niter6i link which at peak hours offers a 15 minute headway service for a 5 km (20&#13;
minute) crossing. CONERJ transported roughly 24 million passengers per year and in 1995 had a&#13;
subsidy of R$29.64 (US$30.875) which gives a subsidy per passenger of R$1.2 (US$1.286) per&#13;
passenger. SRJ intends to sell the assets of CONERJ and concession out its present lines to the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
10.          CTCISERVE are bus companies which operate in the municipalities of Rio de Janeiro,&#13;
Niter6i, Sao Gongalo and Campos providing intermunicipal services and integrated services with other&#13;
modes. CTC also operates in the Santa Teresa neighborhood of Rio where it operates the tramways&#13;
(bondinho). CTC/SERVE operate a total of 26 bus routes and 2 tramway routes. They have a fleet of 369&#13;
buses of which 117 are fueled by gas, 50 are articulated diesel-fueled buses and 142 are standard diesel&#13;
buses with more than 7 years. In 1995, CTC/SERVE had a total of 2,496 employees of which 1,048 in&#13;
administrative functions and 1448 in operating functions. CTC/SERVE staffing per bus is much higher&#13;
than that of its private sector competitors who do not receive subsidies. CTC/SERVE transported 26.6&#13;
million passengers in 1995 and received subsidies which amounted to R$36.79 (US$38.32) or a subsidy&#13;
of US$1.441 per passenger carried. The State has decided to sell CTC/SERVE assets and concession&#13;
out its lines to the private sector operators.&#13;
11.          CODERTE owns 18 road terminals, 2 garage buildings in Rio, 12 parking lots located in&#13;
several municipalities, in addition to shops, rooms and commercial real estate totaling 200 properties.&#13;
The road terminals of Novo Rio and Roberto da Silveira are privately managed. At the end of 1995,&#13;
CODERTE had 695 employees of which 306 in administrative functions and 389 in operating functions.&#13;
In 1995, CODERTE turned an operating profit of R$1.21 million (US$1.26 million). The State feels that&#13;
CODERTE could be much more profitable and therefore it plans to increase private sector participation&#13;
in the management of CODERTE's properties and to sell some of the assets to the private sector.&#13;
12.          DETRO is the agency in charge of regulation of the intermunicipal bus system in the&#13;
State. There are two types of services regulated by DETRO: (a) the urban services which use vehicles&#13;
with two doors, common seats, tumstiles, and can circulate with standing passengers; and (b) the&#13;
intercity services whose buses have reclining seats and which can not circulate with standing&#13;
passengers. In 1995 there were 106 licensed bus companies regulated by DETRO. DETRO's functions&#13;
are to regulate entry/exit, tariff setting, enforce safety and monitor compliance with agreed level-of-&#13;
service. DETRO had 178 employees in 1995 of which 63 in administrative functions and 115 in operating&#13;
functions. DETRO turned an operating profit of R$3.48 million (US$3.625 million). The State will have to&#13;
continue to regulate buses and most likely DETRO will continue with SECTRAN. It is also expected that&#13;
the intermunicipal bus regulatory framework will be revamped and adapted to take into account the&#13;
recently approved concessions law.&#13;
B. Objectives of the State Reform Program in the Urban Transport Sector&#13;
13.          The objectives of the State Reform Project in the urban transport sector are: (a) To&#13;
substantially reduce the high amount of projected annual subsidies paid by the State to urban transport&#13;
agencies (estimated in 1995 at US$363 million or 10 percent of State Revenues) by a combination of&#13;
restructuring and or sales/concessions or management contracts to the private sector; (b) to provide a&#13;
better level-of-service to the users of urban transport services; (c) to finance backlog maintenance which&#13;
is affecting the capacity of the operating agencies to increase revenues and provide an acceptable level-&#13;
of-service; and (d) to introduce an air quality program for vehicle-based emissions.&#13;
14.          The proposed State Reform Project is concentrating its disbursements in actions which&#13;
will facilitate the administrative reforms and restructuring of the agencies, in studies to define the best&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                                ANNEX 4&#13;
options lFor increased private sector participation in the agencies, and in rehabilitation activities designed&#13;
to boost productivity of assets which have been immobilized due to low maintenance budgets. This is&#13;
particularly the case of Flumitrens and the Metro. Under the project, Flumitrens launched a staff&#13;
downsizing program and will improve its revenues by a combination of infrastructure and equipment&#13;
rehabilitation and reduction of fare evasion. The Metro also started to downsize its staff and will take&#13;
advantage of the completion of its BNDES-financed extension to increase its revenues. CTC and Serve,&#13;
which are the only state-owned bus companies in SRJ will have their assets sold to the private sector&#13;
and will be liquidated. Their routes will be absorbed by municipal and intermunicipal private operators.&#13;
CODERTE, the agency in charge of exploration of terminals will also be restructured since it is felt that it&#13;
is producing far less profit than it should. Finally, CONERJ, the ferry boat company will have its assets&#13;
sold and its main lines will be operated under concessions by private operators.&#13;
15.          The project will also foster the creation of a Regional Transport Coordination&#13;
Commission in charge of coordinating all the urban transport tariff and subsidy policies in the RJMR. The&#13;
AMTU-RJ will also prioritize future investments in the region and foster integrated multimodal fares. The&#13;
AMTU-RJ will provide information to the State Regulatory Entity which will oversee regulatory aspects in&#13;
the State. The AMTU-RJ will have representatives of the State Secretary of Transport, the RJ&#13;
municipality Secretary of Transport, representatives of the other municipalities of the RJMR,&#13;
representatives of the operators and the users. In January 1996, an agreement was signed by the State&#13;
and the Municipality of RJ to create a precursor of the AMTU-RJ.&#13;
16.          By the end of the project it is expected that overall subsidies to urban transport agencies&#13;
will be brought to zero in the case of the Metro, CONERJ, CTC/SERVE and reduced by two-thirds of the&#13;
1996 buclgeted level in the case of Flumitrens. Furthermore, the State has agreed to introduce financing&#13;
mechanisms to fund urban transport operating subsidies while needed and eventually contribute for&#13;
future expansions. It is expected that one mechanism to be used will consist on a surcharge on the&#13;
Vehicle Ownership Tax which is collected by the state.&#13;
C. Implementation of Reformis&#13;
17.          The implementation reforms will focus essentially on Flumitrens and the Metro which&#13;
together are the main contributors to 80 percent of the operating deficit of the sector. The overall strategy&#13;
to be followed in both cases is the following:&#13;
(a)    Staff downsizing through voluntary and involuntary dismissals;&#13;
(b)    Reduction of salary benefits to the minimum required by law;&#13;
(c)    Acceleration of private sector involvement in operations and management of the urban&#13;
(transport companies, through concessions and/or rnanagement contracts;&#13;
(cI)   Tariff adjustments to increase revenues in line with inflation; and&#13;
(e)    Sale/lease land assets and building which belong to the agencies to increase non-&#13;
operating revenues.&#13;
18.          Flumitrens and Metro. As a top priority, SRJ has decided that both Flumitrens and the&#13;
Metro should be managed by the private sector. SRJ has set January 1997 as a deadline for starting the&#13;
long term concession of the Metro and January 1998 for the longl term concession of Flumitrens. To&#13;
make both systems more attractive to the private sector, the State has requested that both Flumitrens&#13;
and the Metro start a downsizing program since the ratio urevenue passengers per staff" is too low,&#13;
suggesting that payroll costs should be reduced by almost 50 percent or the revenue passengers&#13;
increased by as much. The initial staff reduction program was completed in May 1996 (with a reduction&#13;
of 1,800 staff in Flumitrens and 800 in Metro) and affected the administrative, engineering and planning&#13;
divisions of the agencies which are overstaffed. The State has used as a model and comparator for the&#13;
Metro, thei Santiago of Chile subway which has approximately the same length, almost twice as many&#13;
passengers at the same average tariff and has an operating surplus. For Flumitrens the model chosen as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-                                  ANNEX4&#13;
a comparator is the Buenos Aires Suburban rail system, which is now operated by private&#13;
concessionaires and has a productivity three times higher than Flumitrens. In addition, SRJ asked&#13;
Flumitrens to put in place a fare evasion control system to increase revenues. The State has also&#13;
instructed the agencies to evaluate the land and buildings which can be sold or leased to increase non-&#13;
operating revenues.&#13;
19.          To decide the type of private management that will be more adequate for both&#13;
companies SRJ has launched two studies to evaluate the options for private sector participation in the&#13;
companies and to prepare the bidding documents for the selected option. These studies were financed&#13;
with funds of an ongoing Bank Loan (Ln. 3633-BR) which financed the decentralization of the rail system&#13;
from Federal to State Governments. SRJ feels that the present State-appointed administrations of&#13;
Flumitrens and Metro are constrained by existing legislation from being bolder in its efforts to restructure&#13;
their companies. SRJ believes that a long-term concession of both Flumitrens and the Metro will reduce&#13;
annual subsidies and improve quality of service as it did in Buenos Aires. To make both systems more&#13;
attractive to potential private sector concessionaires, SRJ has instructed Flumitrens and Metro's&#13;
management to implement the abovementioned downsizing programs which by May 1996 had exceeded&#13;
the targets set by the Government.&#13;
20.          Concessions of the Flumitrens and Metro will likely follow the Argentinean model which&#13;
calls for bids to execute an investment plan defined by the State, propose a schedule of decreasing&#13;
operating subsidies to be paid by the State, and provide a level-of-service stipulated in the bidding&#13;
documents at a tariff set by the Government. The proponent with the lowest net present value of the cost&#13;
of investment plan plus the subsidy is the winner of the concession. The Argentinean model calls for a&#13;
schedule of subsidies which become zero after a certain date, at which time the concessionaire must&#13;
start paying the government an annual concession fee. Suburban railway concessions in Argentina were&#13;
granted for 10 years and the subway concession was granted for 20 years.&#13;
21.          It could be argued that the concessions proposed are in fact management contracts to&#13;
operate the systems and, in fact, they are. Subsidies must be paid because Government reserves the&#13;
right to set tariffs which are affordable by the low-income populations which are the main users of the&#13;
systems. Also one may ask why should the Government be paying for the investment plan and why can't&#13;
the concessionaire do so. Experience has shown that if the concessionaire must raise the money (in the&#13;
case of Flumitrens the investment plan to rehabilitate about 70 percent of its plant is estimated at about&#13;
US$373 million) the concession becomes much less attractive than other opportunities available to the&#13;
private sector which have a much higher rate of return. The main advantage of a concession as done in&#13;
Argentina is that the concessionaire has an incentive to comply with the investment plan at the lowest&#13;
cost and propose the lowest subsidy schedule to win the bid, knowing full well that if its net operating&#13;
deficit is better than the subsidy, the concessionaire will be able to keep the difference. Experience has&#13;
also shown that after a government-financed investment plan, the concessionaire will risk investing its&#13;
own resources to attract more demand and increase revenues while decreasing costs. Since the&#13;
investment plan proposed for Flumitrens is designed to rehabilitate its fleet along with its signaling and&#13;
telecom plant, one may argue that it is justified because is the minimum necessary to attract the private&#13;
sector. Otherwise, chances are that investors will shy away from such ventures because they would have&#13;
very low financial rates of return.&#13;
22.          The main difference between Flumitrens and Metro is that the latter has already secured&#13;
the funds for completing the works required to double its ridership and increase its route length from 23&#13;
to 35 km, while the former will be receiving those funds under the proposed Rio de Janeiro Mass Transit&#13;
Project which is under preparation for financing by the World Bank. The investment for the Metro&#13;
(US$298 million) came from a BNDES loan, and will be used primarily for completing works started more&#13;
than 10 years ago which were halted due to the financial situation of the State. The investment for&#13;
Flumitrens (US$373 million) will be mainly devoted to rehabilitate rolling stock, and upgrading the&#13;
signaling, telecom and stations judged necessary for the system to reach a ridership of one million&#13;
passengers per day. It is therefore important to follow up the staff downsizing and operational&#13;
improvement actions started with the State Reform project with this investment program in order to&#13;
entice the private sector to operate the system under concession.&#13;

23.          CONERJ. The ferry boat company will have its assets sold to the highest bidder.&#13;
SECTRkN will act as the overseer of the private sector concessionaires which would operate the ferry&#13;
lines in the Guanabara and Sepetiba bays. SRJ has set a date of November 1996 for completing this&#13;
sale and has commissioned a valuation study using its own funds.&#13;
24.          CTC and SERVE are also to be liquidated. Its assets are mainly buses and garages&#13;
which will be sold to the private sector. The routes operated by C(TC and SERVE will be taken over by&#13;
existing bus concessionaires which will be selected through competitive bidding.&#13;
25.          CODERTE, the agency in charge of the terminals and parking garages of the State, will&#13;
also be sold. SRJ has decided to undertake a study to determine the value of the assets involved, to&#13;
obtain aill the legal titles of the properties, and to prepare terms of reference to select a real estate&#13;
company which will sell or rent the properties owned by SRJ.&#13;
D. Sector Reforms&#13;
26.          Before awarding concessions to the private sector in the urban transport sector it is&#13;
important to define a basic sector regulatory framework and the responsibilities of each of the urban&#13;
transport agencies involved. We depart form the premise that the State has agreed to the creation of an&#13;
independient State Regulatory Commission which will oversee all the major regulatory issues in the&#13;
State, including urban transport. This commission will have a transport division, but will use a pool of&#13;
economists, lawyers and other specialists which will be dealing with all the sectors. It is also assumed&#13;
that this commission will issue basic regulatory guidelines which are to be followed in all sectors, but will&#13;
expect that each subsector will approve a set of very specific regulatory policies for each of its&#13;
subsectors. For example, based on general principles for market entry/exit, tariff setting, safety&#13;
regulations, etc. the Secretary of Transport (SECTRAN) must prepare a set of regulations for rail, sea&#13;
and land transport. These regulations must be approved by the State Regulatory Commission and serve&#13;
as the regulatory framework for the mode. SECTRAN has invited consultants to prepare such regulatory&#13;
framework and a plan to restructure SECTRAN's organization.&#13;
27.          In parallel with the preparation of a regulatory framework, it is also necessary to establish&#13;
the new structure for SECTRAN. In fact the present structure of SECTRAN and its different agencies&#13;
(Flumitrens, Metro, CONERJ, CTC/SERVE, CODERTE) will be inadequate once the new concessions to&#13;
operate those modes are granted. As mentioned in the main text, regulation of all sectors will be the&#13;
responsibility of a State Regulatory Commission. It is expected, however, that the State will delegate&#13;
inspection and monitoring and supervision functions in urban transport to SECTRAN, which in turn will&#13;
either delegate them to its directorates or to the agencies in charge of overseeing the concessionaires&#13;
day-to-day performance. To undertake this work it is expected that SECTRAN will use contractors&#13;
instead of force account. In the specific case of buses which involves the monitoring and supervision of&#13;
more than 1000 lines, SECTRAN intends to restructure DETRO to make this organization more&#13;
accountable, flexible and transparent probably by sub-contracting its functions to the private sector.&#13;
28.          At present the regulations for rail transport are fedieral regulations because until recently&#13;
the railway mode was basically under federal jurisdiction. With the decentralization of urban railways to&#13;
the State, it might be necessary to get Federal government approval for Railway State legislation.&#13;
Similarly, all sea regulation, such as the regulations that apply to CONERJ, are under the federal&#13;
jurisdiction. Again with the concession of CONERJ lines to private entrepreneurs the State may want to&#13;
get federal approval for specific State legislation. If by any chance that becomes difficult because&#13;
several lobbies may want to keep the regulation under the Federal Government umbrella, than the State&#13;
should examine other avenues to do so.&#13;
29.          Finally, the Regional Transport Coordination Commission will act as a policy coordinator&#13;
for the three levels of govemment involved in urban transport, as an adviser on tariff and subsidy policy&#13;
and a main forum to discuss and prioritize the main investments in the RJMR. It will probably be called to&#13;
make presentations to the State Regulatory Commission but will not have deliberative power.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RIO DE JANEIRO MASS TRANSIT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
1.           General. The Flumitrens system is organized into five corridors: D. Pedro Il-Deodoro,&#13;
Deodoro-S. Cruz, Deodoro-Japeri, D. Pedro Il-B. Roxo, and B. Maua-Saracuruna, with about 684 km of&#13;
main line track. The system is electrified and passenger services are provided with electric multiple units.&#13;
The rail network mainline is broad gauge (1.60m), and has an adequate alignment, about 2 percent of&#13;
total track length is in curves with less than 300m radius (Table 5.1), permitting if the track was&#13;
maintained in good conditions, maximum speeds up to 80 km/h. Passenger traffic lines are laid mostly&#13;
with 57 kg/m rail (Table 5.2). Sleepers are impregnated timber (about 69 percent of total number placed&#13;
in mainline track), but mono-block and bi-block concrete sleepers have been used on main line relaying&#13;
for some years (Table 5.3). Rail fastenings are rigid in some sections and elastic in others. Ballast is&#13;
crushed stone of reasonable quality, but not adequate in quantity and in general, polluted. Flumitrens'&#13;
main problem related to track infra/superstructure is still deferred maintenance, the track condition has&#13;
been gradually deteriorating during the last years as a consequence of budgetary restrictions. This&#13;
situation is gradually improving as a result of the track rehabilitation works being carried out under the&#13;
ongoing Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Loan 3633-BR), works which are&#13;
expected to be completed during 1997.&#13;
2.           Flumitrens' specifications for track rehabilitation are summarized as follows: (a) rails are&#13;
standard 57 kg/m and are welded by the flush-butt process at a fixed depots into longer lengths (240m)&#13;
before laying and are then joined again in the track using the alumino-thermit process; (b) rail fastening&#13;
are of elastic type, to be used in all track renewals; (c) timber sleepers are of selected wood and&#13;
impregnated; (d) concrete sleepers are locally manufactured, pre- or post-tensioned and are placed at&#13;
1,850 per km using elastic fastenings; and (e) crushed stone ballast is provided at about 1,500m  per km.&#13;
3.           In early 1991, CBTU restructured the organization of the Rio de Janeiro System&#13;
(Flumitrens), including the permanent way labor force, decentralizing the administration by corridors. It is&#13;
felt, however, that further refinements are still needed for productivity improvements, and for allowing&#13;
private participation in track maintenance tasks and thus continue to reduce its staff. In addition, the&#13;
planning, programming, cost accounting and monitoring methods and procedures need to be&#13;
strengthened. A specific study (man-power development rationalization) is being carried out under Loan&#13;
3633-BR. The track maintenance force in Flumitrens is divided into two sectors: one responsible for the&#13;
maintenance of Deodoro, Japeri and Santa Cruz corridors and other for Belford Roxo, Gramacho and&#13;
Meter Gauge corridors. Current total working staff is about 324 staff (a reduction of 536 staff compared&#13;
to 860 in 1986), representing 0.52 staff/km, compatible with modern standards (0.40/0.50 staff/km). Each&#13;
unit has the responsibility for periodic routine maintenance in their sections of track, including the cyclical&#13;
work performed annually by special gangs with mechanized equipment. Major rehabilitation or new track&#13;
works are carried out by the private sector. The standards of maintenance can be assessed regularly on&#13;
the graphs produced by a track condition recording unit; the system has one Permanent Way workshop&#13;
in Deodoro which provides maintenance support to track equipment. The condition of the equipment fleet&#13;
is gradually improving under the rehabilitation program of the ongoing Loan 3633-BR and State Reform&#13;
Program.&#13;
A. Civil Works&#13;
4.           Civil Works under the proposed project include the rehabilitation and modemization of&#13;
eleven stations and the construction of two stations. Details of location and type of works to be&#13;
performed on those stations under the project are shown in Figure 5.1 of this Annex. This component&#13;
also includes the construction of five pedestrian overpasses, 8,000m of fences in areas adjacent to some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                                ANNEX5&#13;
selected stations. The overall cost of this component amounts to US$31 millions including contingencies&#13;
or 8.2 percent of total project cost.&#13;
5.           Permnanent Way Rehabilitation Works. These works would consist of rail replacement&#13;
with long welded rails on 10 kms of the Leopoldina corridor, superstructure for the Gramacho-Saracuruna&#13;
second line, installation of 50,000 sleepers on the five corridors,, and would amount to about US$6.7&#13;
million including contingencies or 1.8 percent of total project cost.&#13;
B. Systems&#13;
6.           A description of the systems currently operated by Flumitrens and improvements&#13;
included in the project are summarized bellow:&#13;
(a)    Electrification. The EMU's pick up power at 3 kv DC from an overhead catenary, which&#13;
is supplied by rectifier substations at 44 kv AC input. In addition to providing power for&#13;
the trains, the substations also reduce the AC voltage to 6.6 and 4.4 kv for use in other&#13;
power facilities connected to the substations by ovierhead transmission lines. Several of&#13;
these transmission lines require upgrading because of deterioration and undersized&#13;
conductors. The proposed project includes the following interventions, in order to provide&#13;
more reliable power supply for train control systems operation:&#13;
*     installation of 4.4 kv, 44 kv and 3 Ikv transmission lines, from Gramacho&#13;
to Saracuruna and reform of the 4.4 kv and 44 kv circuits between&#13;
Barao de Maui and Gramacho;&#13;
*     installation of second circuit plus 44kv between D.Pedro II and&#13;
Mangueira;&#13;
*     rebuilding of the substation of Deodoro, currently out of operation due to&#13;
damage by fire. The equipment reqjuired are in storage;&#13;
*     rebuilding of the substation of Benfica, deteriorated because of age,&#13;
including project, with equipment that are in storage;&#13;
*     construction and installation of the substation of Saracuruna;&#13;
*     rehabilitation of the substation of Nilopolis (required equipment is&#13;
already in storage); and&#13;
*     replacement, including a study, oI the existing earth systems, at each&#13;
substation and mid point section cabin along the overhead catenary, in&#13;
view of the deterioration due to corrosion.&#13;
These improvements will reduce the interference with the main line&#13;
power flow, and increase the reliability of the system operation. This component&#13;
has been estimated to cost US$23.8 million including contingencies or 6.4&#13;
percent of total project cost.&#13;
(b)    Signaling/Train Control.&#13;
Centralized Traffic Control (CTC). Some sections of the Flumitrens system&#13;
have been equipped with the CTC components and have been made&#13;
operational. Other sections have not been equipped, and therefore the CCO&#13;
operators have to use radio and telephone lines to wayside signal locations. The&#13;
lack of CTC increases the number of operating staff required, and also has an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                                ANNEX5&#13;
adverse effect on operating reliability. The proposed project component would&#13;
provide CTC facilities throughout the system, by adding equipment in Japeri and&#13;
Santa Cruz corridors, and in D. Pedro and Deodoro yards in order to make the&#13;
entire system operable by CTC. Some components are in the storage&#13;
warehouse, and others would be procured under the project.&#13;
Automatic Train Control (ATC). Currently, none of the EMU's fleet are&#13;
equipped with the necessary on-board cab signaling equipment, nor is any of the&#13;
field equipment (at trackside) installed. There are 180 sets of on-board&#13;
equipment stored in the warehouse, but this quantity is considered to be&#13;
insufficient to equip the entire fleet of refurbished EMU's. In addition, there is a&#13;
large quantity of ATC field equipment storage in the warehouse, and more fully-&#13;
compatible components would need to be procured under the proposed project.&#13;
The proposed project includes the installation of field and board ATC system, so&#13;
62 sets of on-board equipment have to be acquired in addition. The lack of ATC&#13;
has resulted in many near collisions between trains, and also resulted in&#13;
collisions causing damages. This lack effectively prevents headway reduction,&#13;
thus limiting the total passenger-carrying capacity of the system. The signaling&#13;
component has been estimated at US$34.8 million including contingencies or&#13;
9.4 percent of total project cost.&#13;
(c)    Telecommunications. Until now the fiber-optic cable links and the associated&#13;
multiplexing equipment were installed between D. Pedro II and Santa Cruz. The&#13;
proposed project includes the installation of this equipment on the Deodoro - Japeri line.&#13;
The necessary fiber-optic cables are in storage. This fiber-optic network, when&#13;
completed, will be used to: control and monitor the power substations and power&#13;
switches along the line; the CTC (signaling system) and the telephone links between&#13;
CCO and all substations; CTC (signal) control locations; and administration facilities&#13;
such as workshops and offices, with the CCO.&#13;
(d)    Central Control Office (CCO). The fiber-optic links carry information, data and voice&#13;
telecommunications to the CCO. The proposed project includes the connection of the&#13;
various power and CTC (signaling) locations along the line with the CCO. The&#13;
information are provided at control desks and displayed by visual indications on control&#13;
panels. All this equipment is in place and is in partial operation awaiting connection.&#13;
Some modifications to the display panels are needed to bring them into correspondence&#13;
with the revised layouts in the D. Pedro II and Deodoro yards. The overall cost of this&#13;
component amounts to US$7.5 million including contingencies or 2 percent of total&#13;
project cost.&#13;
(e)    Automatic Fare Collection. Installation of automatic fare collection system  in all&#13;
stations. This equipment has been estimated at US$11.7 million including contingencies&#13;
or 3.2 percent of total project cost.&#13;
C. Rolling Stock&#13;
7.           Attached as Table 5.4 is the actual fleet size for Rio de Janeiro showing current train&#13;
availability. Table 5.5 shows the future plan for train availability for Rio de Janeiro after implementation&#13;
of the rehabilitation proposal. These tables show substantial anticipated increases in train availability&#13;
after implementation of the proposed project component. The proposal presented to achieve this,&#13;
described in this Annex, is straightforward, feasible and technically sound. Flumitrens would have to&#13;
contract out all the work proposed due to lack of current capacity within their own organization. The work&#13;
contents of the proposal is such that it is expected that a wide range of capable contractors could submit&#13;
competitive bids. The contractors could be local or international or a combination involving Joint&#13;
Ventures or Licensing Agreements. The overall work content entail mechanical, electrical and civil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-                                   ANNEX5&#13;
engineering. The extent of these works, coupled with the quantities involved, is expected to be attractive&#13;
to interested Contractors. Within the Rio de Janeiro network there are several passenger train sets&#13;
presently not available for revenue service due to the following reasons (Table 5.4): (a) Accident/collision&#13;
damage; (b) lack of spare parts due to budgetary restrictions; and (c) material/components&#13;
cannibalization, resulting from (b). These factors have significantly reduced the number of train sets for&#13;
passenger service use (train availability). An ideal service should provide between 90 percent and 92&#13;
percent availability, the remaining 8 percent to 10 percent is out cf service for maintenance. The existing&#13;
train sets are in average condition, and achieve about 60 percent service availability. By investing in the&#13;
proposed rehabilitation and modernization, the network would raise train availability figures significantly&#13;
in order to cope with the projected passenger demand (Table 5.5).&#13;
8.            The proposed rolling stock component, which is the largest included in the project, is&#13;
designed to improve passenger train set availability and reliability to meet the planned future increased&#13;
revenue service. It covers the following areas: (a) rehabilitation of 103 EMU's currently operating; (b)&#13;
Refurbishment/modernization of 36 EMU's currently out of service; and (c ) rehabilitation of bogies and&#13;
pneumatic systems of 44 EMUs. The cost of this component has been estimated at US$245 million&#13;
including contingencies or 65 percent of total project cost. The main characteristics of the EMU's fleet to&#13;
be rehabilitated under this project component are:&#13;
For rehabilitation: Total - 103&#13;
Carbon steel - 34 EMU Series 400 - 35 years (modernized 19 years ago)&#13;
Stainless steel - 2 EMU Series 500 - 19 years&#13;
Stainless steel - 25 EMU Series 700 - 16 years&#13;
Stainless steel - 10 EMU Series 800 - 16 years&#13;
Stainless steel - 32 EMU Series 900 - 16 years&#13;
For refurbishment/modernization: Total - 36&#13;
Carbon steel - 6 EMU Series 400 - 35 years (modernized 19 years ago)&#13;
Stainless steel - 3 EMU Series 500 - 19 years&#13;
Stainless steel - 4 EMU Series 700 - 16 years&#13;
Stainless steel - 7 EMU Series 800 - 16 years&#13;
Stainless steel - 16 EMU Series 900 - 16 years&#13;
9.            Engineering  Designs. Final engineering designs for track rehabilitation works,&#13;
modernization of nine stations and specifications for part olF the EMU's fleet rehabilitation and&#13;
refurbishment program  have been completed. Flumitrens plans to finish by September 1996 all&#13;
preliminary engineering designs as well as final engineering desiigns for those components included in&#13;
the first year of the project.&#13;
10.          Supervision. The project includes the provision of consultants (1,324 stafflmonths) for&#13;
the implementation and supervision of each project component. The cost of these services have been&#13;
estimated at US$6 million including contingencies or 1.5 percent of total project cost.&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND TRAFFIC SUB-COMPONENT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           This section describes the environmental and traffic safety component of the proposed&#13;
project which includes:&#13;
(a)   the design of a vehicle inspection and maintenance program; and&#13;
(b)   the development of a system to process and collect traffic violation fines and&#13;
enforce them as a deterrent to traffic accidents.&#13;
2.           In addition, the proposed project includes studies and technical assistance to support&#13;
improvements in motor vehicle emissions control and the development of an integrated&#13;
transport/environmental strategy for the RJMR.&#13;
B. The Environmental Sub-Component&#13;
3.           Inspection and maintenance (I/M) serves two purposes in a vehicle emissions control&#13;
program. First, it helps to identify vehicles in which maladjustment or other mechanical problems are&#13;
causing higher emissions than necessary. Second, it ensures that the emission control equipment on&#13;
vehicles so equipped remains in place and operational, so that the emissions benefits of that equipment&#13;
are realized. The first purpose applies mostly to older vehicles without emission controls; for emission-&#13;
controlled vehicles, the second is much more important. An effective I/M program is essential to ensure&#13;
that the emissions benefits projected for the adoption of new vehicle emissions standards are actually&#13;
attained. The project finances the design of an I/M program and will recommend how the l/M program&#13;
can be implemented through concessions to the private sector. The cost of the basic study to design the&#13;
l/M program is estimated at US$0.6 million.&#13;
C. The Traffic Subcomponent&#13;
4.           The objective of the traffic management component is to design and put in place a&#13;
system to enforce, process and collect fines for traffic violations. This study is estimated to cost US$0.4&#13;
million. The number of traffic violations in the RJMR is high, but once fined, traffic offenders do not pay&#13;
their fines. Because the system to process and collect fines is very slow, traffic violators continue to&#13;
disrespect regulations and are not properly checked. The proceeds of fines would also contribute to funds&#13;
for the refinement of the urban transport system.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY STUDIES&#13;
1.           This annex describes the studies and technical assistance for project supervision and&#13;
management and training to be contracted to support the policy and institutional development&#13;
component. The studies will be divided in three categories: (a) studies which are only Flumitrens related;&#13;
and (b) studies to enhance modal integration and (c) the training component which should contribute to&#13;
the training of staff which will be monitoring the concession as well as training in-house and abroad.&#13;
2.           A list of the proposed studies and training is presented below. Draft terms of reference&#13;
for the first year studies and outlines for the other studies were agreed at appraisal and were ready by&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
A. Flumitrens Related Studies&#13;
3.           Assisting the Concession to the Private Sector. The first set of Actions Plans&#13;
concerns the preparation of bid documents to be used in the concession process: (a) institutional and&#13;
organizational arrangements; (b) investment plan to be undertaken; (c) evaluation of operating subsidies;&#13;
(d) patrimonial agreement on the valuation and assets to transferred; (e) aspects relating to transfer of&#13;
personinel, pension benefits, and miscellaneous human resource-related issues; and (f) legal and&#13;
administrative aspects for concession;&#13;
4.           Technical Assistance Until the Concession. rhis technical assistance will provide key&#13;
advisors who will work with the President of Flumitrens to further rationalize and stream line operations&#13;
and mnaintenance to decrease the perceived risks of the conceission. For example, hiring of experts in&#13;
rolling stock maintenance and railways operations management, management accounting to define clear&#13;
cost allocation rules, specialists to implement the payroll software, experts to build a reliable data base.&#13;
4.           Technical Engineering Studies in Signaling and Telecom. These studies would&#13;
address the needs identified during preparation for the installation of existing and new signaling and&#13;
telecoirn equipment.&#13;
5.           Supervision Consultants. The implementation of the investment plan will be&#13;
supervised by engineering consultants in charge of ensuring that the works and goods comply with&#13;
specifications.&#13;
6.           Project Management Consultants. These consultants will be in charge of supporting the&#13;
Project Management and Implementation Group until the completion of the Project.&#13;
B. Modal Integration Related Studies&#13;
7.           Modal Integration. The objective of the second set of Action Plans is to support the&#13;
establishment of the AMTU-RJ policy framework and provide practical recommendations for&#13;
implenmenting modal integration, namely: (a) updating of the Transport, Land Use, and Air Quality portion&#13;
of the Master Plans of the RJMR with emphasis on route rationailization and modal and tariff integration;&#13;
and (b) a intermunicipal route management and rationalization study.&#13;
8.           Niter6i - Sao Gongalo Corridor. Preparation of feasibility studies and bidding&#13;
documents for the Niter6i - S3o Gon,alo mass transportation system. the RJMR master plan should be&#13;
analyzed in order to give the basic guidelines for the development of future systems for this corridor.&#13;

9.      In view of the concession, staff who remain in the Flumitrens holding will have two primary&#13;
functions: (a) to manage the implementation of the investment plan; and (b) to monitor the&#13;
concessionaire on behalf of the state regulatory entity.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RIO DE JANEIRO MASS TRANSIT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           A standard cost-benefit analysis was performed to evaluate the economic impact of the&#13;
implementation of the proposed infrastructure and equipment component (consolidate the rehabilitation&#13;
of Flumitrens and build/rehabilitate the transfer stations between the trains, metro and ferries), which&#13;
represents 96 percent of the total proposed project. This Annex describes the demand analysis and the&#13;
set of benefits and costs that have been considered in the economic evaluation, as well as the&#13;
assumptions adopted regarding key inputs, such as the value of time. Direct user benefits include travel&#13;
time and operating cost savings; indirect benefits arise from the reduction of negative externalities&#13;
(accident and air pollution costs). Investment costs comprise civil works, permanent way, operating&#13;
systems, rolling stock, and costs of projects and studies. Both benefits and costs are defined as&#13;
incremental compared to the situation of the end of the project CBTU/IBRD I (Ln. 3633-BR). Throughout&#13;
the analysis, and for illustrative purposes, the proposed investments were evaluated with and without the&#13;
accident and air pollution externalities. A more detailed description of the data and assumptions&#13;
supporting the economic evaluation summarized in this annex can be found in Reports 8 and 9 in the&#13;
Project Files.&#13;
2.           This economic evaluation estimates the discounted expected present value of the&#13;
infrastructure investment's net benefits, the expected internal economic rates of return, as well as the&#13;
expected benefit/cost ratios for a set of discount rates, which includes the 10 percent discount rate, which&#13;
has been defined by SEAIN (Secretary of Planning for the Federative Republic of Brazil), as well by its&#13;
Commission of External Financing (COFIEX) for the project appraisal of foreign investments. In addition,&#13;
the sensitivity analysis included in this annex provides an idea of how the economic rates of return would&#13;
change due to deviations from the value of benefits and costs used in the base case. The analysis is&#13;
then complemented by a table of impacts of the project which are evaluated on a qualitative basis.&#13;
B. Choice of a Project Base Case&#13;
Mass Transit Options&#13;
3.           Following current Bank policy recommendations for the appraisal of mass transit&#13;
investments contained in the Urban Transport Policy Paper (World Bank, 1986), the proposed&#13;
investments were compared against two totally segregated busways with regular buses and a totally&#13;
segregated busways with articulated buses (Annex 13, ref. 8a). In all cases, the analyses showed that the&#13;
proposed investments had a higher internal rate of return.&#13;
C. Demand Analysis&#13;
Demand Modeling&#13;
4.           The demand estimates used in the economic evaluation are the result of a simulation of&#13;
the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region transport network, performed with the Mantra System'&#13;
microcomputer program. The urban transport demand model used by this program is a classical&#13;
aggregate four-stage transport planning model, which comprises trip generation, trip distribution, modal&#13;
Mantra Computer System was developed by Logit - Logistica Informatica e Transportes, Brazil, and SDG - Steer&#13;
Davies Gleave, England.&#13;

split, and trip assignment. This model estimates peak (6 hours) and off-peak (10 hours) periods of public&#13;
transport demand, which are assigned to bus, metro and railway networks.&#13;
5.           The model Mantra is integrated with a Geographic Information System, GisPlus. 2 In&#13;
order to use the model, it was necessary to create a GIS database for Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan&#13;
Region (RJMR), which comprises a zoning layer and a transport network layer (made up of line and node&#13;
layers). To develop the databases for the demand study, the team benefited from the existence of a&#13;
model of the transport network prepared under the Transport Master Plan of the RJMR financed by the&#13;
Bank. This network was prepared using GisPlus and then imported by Mantra.&#13;
6.           The zoning system adopted is based on the RJ sub-regions, which were defined in the&#13;
Rio de Janeiro Master Plan. This zoning system was digitizecl using GisPlus and then imported by&#13;
Mantra.&#13;
7.           The present demand study used as primary data the 1994 Household  and&#13;
Origin/Destination (OD) survey undertaken by IPLAN-RIO for the Rio de Janeiro Master Plan based on&#13;
household samples in all RJMR. From this survey were obtained the following data: transport demand on&#13;
a daily/hourly basis, breakdown into peak and off-peak period ancd breakdown into trip purposes.&#13;
8.           Peak hour periods considered were the following: 06:00 a.m. to 09:00 a.m. and 16:00&#13;
p.m. to 19:00 p.m. The number of trips in this period corresponds to 56,4 percent of the weekday&#13;
ridershiip. Both periods have similar number of trips and almost the same peak hour factor. The OD&#13;
matrix breakdown into trip purposes shows that 56,6 percent of trips are commuter and business trips&#13;
and 43,4 percent are related to other trip purposes.&#13;
9.           The steps in the demand modeling exercise were:&#13;
(a)    Trip Generation. This step consists of the estimation of the number of trips&#13;
which will be produced by and attracted to the area of influence of the projects&#13;
considered in the study. In the present study it was conservatively assumed that&#13;
the 1994 OD matrix is a good estimate up to the year 2001. After this year, a&#13;
yearly demand increase of 1 percent per year was considered. Car and walking&#13;
trips were not considered at all.&#13;
(b)    Trip Distribution. This step consists of the determination of the origin zone and&#13;
destination zone for each trip based on the types of trips produced by and&#13;
attracted to each zone and the interzonal "impedance" values (typically travel&#13;
times). Also in this case there is the assumption of using the current matrix as an&#13;
estimate up to the year 2001.&#13;
(c)    Modal Choice consists of the calculation of which trips will use the bus network&#13;
and the metro system. The Mantra model allows the competition between single&#13;
modes and combined modes. The modail choice model used is the multinomial&#13;
Logit model. It is important to point out that for each zone pair of interest, for the&#13;
area of influence of the Railway lines, there will always be competition between&#13;
bus and railway+bus and in some cases metro+bus. The model utility functions&#13;
considered the same values of travel time used in the economic evaluation. Non&#13;
cash cost of transfer is taken into account as an impedance to choose a mode.&#13;
(d)    Trip assignment consists of the "loadinig" of the passenger trips onto the multi-&#13;
modal public transport network. The method used to assign the trips made within&#13;
each model, is the "all or nothing" procedure with no capacity restraint iterations&#13;

10.          The model was applied for the situation "without" and "with" the project. The outputs&#13;
obtained from the application of the model are the number of trips, passenger-kms and passenger-hours&#13;
by each individual mode: bus, metro and railway. By running the model for the situation "without" and&#13;
"with," data were obtained on the additional trips in the railway mode, and also the decrease in bus trips&#13;
which result from the implementation of the proposed project. The following paragraphs summarize the&#13;
situation "without" and "with" project for the railway lines above and the results in terms of passenger-&#13;
kilometers, passenger-hours and average speeds are summarized below:&#13;
(a)    Situation 'Without Project" (Year 1998 and 2001). This is the situation at the&#13;
end of CBTU/BIRD I project (Ln. 3633-BR). The main traffic characteristics of&#13;
the study area in the situation "without" the project on a daily basis are: average&#13;
peak-hour bus speeds of 17.04 km/hour with a total of 4,094,360 passengers,&#13;
with 83,594,816 passenger-kms generated by bus trips with origins or&#13;
destinations in the RJMR. The corresponding number of passenger hours is&#13;
5,005,279. The railway trips generated for daily origins/destinations in the study&#13;
area a total of 837,955 passengers with 20,979,434 passenger-kms,&#13;
corresponding to 517,063 passenger-hours. The transit modal choice in terms of&#13;
trips generated by the study area would be 71.75 percent bus, 13.56 percent&#13;
metro, and 14.69 percent railway.&#13;
(b)    Situation "With Project" (Year 1998). On a daily basis, the average peak-hour&#13;
bus speeds in the study area would rise to 17.66 km/h and daily demand for bus&#13;
transportation would go down to 3,954,717 passengers with 80,778,031&#13;
passenger-kms and 4,845,248 passenger-hours. The daily demand for railway&#13;
trips will go up to a total of 945,315 passengers with 23,707,032 passenger-kms&#13;
and 584,492 passenger-hours. The transit modal choice in terms of trips&#13;
generated by the study area&#13;
would be 70.05 percent bus,    Table 9.1: Demand Levels in the Railway&#13;

11.          The demand estimates for the railway lines (all corridors) in the year 2001 indicate: (a) a&#13;
peak-hour inbound volume of about 93,847 passengers; (b) a peak-hour outbound volume of 31,881&#13;
passengers; (c) a total of about 8,673,012 week-day boardings; and (d) an annual ridership of more than&#13;
450 million passengers.&#13;
D. Benefits&#13;
Value ofl Time&#13;
12.          Mass transit projects can hardly be economically justified without accounting for the real&#13;
resource savings that economies of time represent. The monetary value of time by which the time&#13;
savings ,are multiplied to obtain the benefits from time savings is a key input in the economic evaluation&#13;
of the infrastructure components of this project. Individual values of time are traditionally considered to&#13;
be a function of income, in particular a function of the individual wage level. Thus, the value of time used&#13;
in the calculation of time savings is derived from the income distribution of users, disaggregated by&#13;
transport mode and trip purpose, and from information on wage levels. Table 9.2 shows the income of&#13;
public transport users in the zone of influence of the FLUMITRENS and is disaggregated by mode. The&#13;
information was obtained from the 1994 Household and Origin/Destination (OD) survey for the Rio de&#13;
Janeiro MAaster Plan.&#13;
13.          The base minimum wage used was R$112 which at the shadow price of foreign&#13;
exchange of 1 is equivalent to US$112. From this minimum wage base, the value of fringe benefits was&#13;
considered separate from payroll taxes. Fringe benefits in Brazil include vacation and the 13th month of&#13;
salary; both entail scaling the base salary by a factor of 1.25. Commuting and other purpose trips are&#13;
valued as a proportion of net wages. This implies subtracting direct taxes paid by the employee from the&#13;
base wage, which includes fringe benefits. The employee is subject to a payroll tax that varies between 8&#13;
percent and 10 percent. In addition, the income tax should be subtracted. By assuming that one-third of&#13;
passengers are not tax-exempt and do not evade taxes, the net wage deflating factor will be in the 0.92-&#13;
0.88 range. An average factor of 0.9 was used. Business trips are valued at gross wages, where fringe&#13;
benefits and payroll taxes are taken into account. Payroll taxes in Brazil vary between 38 percent and 45&#13;
percent and about 35 percent are paid by the employer. By combining fringe benefits and employer&#13;
contribution on payroll taxes, the base wage must be scaled by a factor of 1.60 (1.25 plus 0.35).&#13;
14.          Hourly wages for each transport mode users are estimated by multiplying the individual&#13;
wage (in minimum wages) by the value of the minimum wage and dividing the result by 157, the&#13;
assumed average number of hours worked in a given month. Common practice in the appraisal of urban&#13;
transport projects is to use a proportion of the hourly wage rate to approximate the value of time saved.&#13;
This propiortion as well as the wage rate base chosen for the calculation-whether gross or net wages-&#13;
depend on the type of trip. Three types of trip can be distinguished for the purposes of the analysis:&#13;
home-to-work trips (or commuting trips), work-related trips (or business trips), and non-work related trips&#13;
(or other trips), for example shopping or visiting the doctor. E-conomic theory indicates that both&#13;
commuting trips and other trips should be valued as a proportion of the net wage. Empirical evidence&#13;
suggests that this proportion may vary between 20 and 100 percent. The value adopted in the economic&#13;
evaluation was a value of 17.5 percent based on a study undertaken a few years ago for a similar city&#13;
with the :same type of population. A 20 percent value was tested as part of the sensitivity analysis.&#13;
Economic theory also indicates that business trips during working hours be valued at 100 percent of the&#13;
gross wage rate.3 The resulting values of time used in the economic evaluation are summarized in Table&#13;
9.5 and the proportion of passenger-hours spent traveling by type of trip is summarized in Table 9.3.&#13;
When the! value of time is equal to zero the IERR is still 38.17 percent.&#13;
In developed countries, estimates of the value of time for journey to work ranges from 20 to 100 percent of the&#13;
gross wage rate. A recent review of the literature concludes that a reasonable average value of time for journey to&#13;
work is 50 percent of the gross wage rate. See Kenneth Small, Urban Transportation Economics, Harwood&#13;

Direct Benefits&#13;
15.          Direct benefits estimated in the economic evaluation are travel time savings, operating&#13;
cost savings, bus system control savings, and road maintenance cost savings:&#13;
(a)    Travel time savings result mainly from the transfer of bus passengers into the&#13;
new lines, and from existing metro and rail passengers who can save time in&#13;
their trips by taking advantage of the new transport facility. Travel time savings&#13;
also result from the increased operating speeds of the buses that continue&#13;
operation and, to a lesser extent, of car traffic. The program used to model the&#13;
demand works with an origin-destination matrix where the number of trips is&#13;
fixed. The number of "legs" comprising those trips may vary. When the new link&#13;
is introduced in the network, the modal split is affected and some trip itineraries&#13;
change. Thus, the demand model estimates the diverted demand, but it does&#13;
not estimate the so-called generated demand, that is, the additional trips that&#13;
will be potentially generated throughout the RJMR, but particularly in the&#13;
corridors directly affected by the investment. Omission of generated demand&#13;
yields a conservative level of demand and, consequently, results in a lower rate&#13;
of retum. Travel time savings are measured for each mode by the difference&#13;
between the total number of moming peak passenger-hours spent without the&#13;
project and those spent with the project. These peak-hour estimates are&#13;
converted to annual values and then multiplied by the assumed value of time to&#13;
obtain a monetary value of time savings. The net change in travel time across&#13;
the four modes is considered to be the overall measure of the travel time&#13;
savings;&#13;
{lPass-hr (w/o) - Pass-hr (w)] x VoT x PHF x ND)} 1,000, where Pass-hr are&#13;
passenger-hours, VoT is the value of time, PHF is the peak-hour factor, and ND&#13;
is the number of operating days in a year.&#13;
(b)    Operating cost savings for the non-rail modes derive principally from the&#13;
improved commercial and traffic speeds, which can be achieved by buses and&#13;
cars, respectively. Operating cost savings are measured for each mode by the&#13;
difference between the moming peak passenger-kilometers carried without the&#13;
project and those carried with the project. All trips were considered irrespective&#13;
of their purpose. These peak-hour estimates are converted to annual values and&#13;
then multiplied by the assumed values of operating cost per passenger-kilometer&#13;
for each mode to obtain a monetary value of operating cost savings. The net&#13;
change in operating costs across the four modes is considered to be the overall&#13;
measure of operating cost savings. Operating cost savings include wages and&#13;
salaries, materials, energy and general expenditures. An alternative method to&#13;
estimate these savings was to calculate the actual number of buses eliminated&#13;
at peak hour due to the construction of the line and estimate the savings due to&#13;
the elimination of the buses and reduction in bus kilometers produced. Table 9.4&#13;
shows the calculations used.&#13;
{[Pass-km (w/o) x OC (w/o)] - [Pass-km (w) x OC (w)] x PHF x ND}, 1,000,&#13;
where OC are operating costs per passenger-kilometer.&#13;
(c)    Bus system control cost savings depend critically on the reduction of the bus&#13;
vehicle fleet, which is assumed to follow from the reduction in bus patronage&#13;
after the metro line opens. Bus system control cost savings are measured by a&#13;
given percentage (8 percent) of bus operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-74 -                                 ANNEX9&#13;
(d)    Road maintenance cost savings derive from the possibility of delaying&#13;
periodic maintenance mainly because of reduced bus traffic on the corridors&#13;
under consideration. The benefits from reduced vehicle operating costs resulting&#13;
from reduced pavement damage are not considered.&#13;
{[Pass-km (w/o) - Pass-km (w)] x RMC, x PHF x ND}, 1,000 where RMC are&#13;
road maintenance cost savings per passenger-kilometer.&#13;
Indirect Benefits&#13;
16.          Indirect benefits arise from the reduction in externalities, such as accidents and air&#13;
pollution:&#13;
(a)    Accident cost savings are measured for each mode by the difference between&#13;
the moming peak passenger-kilometers carried without the project and those&#13;
carried with the project. These peak-hour estimates are converted to annual&#13;
values and then multiplied by the assuimed values of accident costs per 1,000&#13;
passenger-kilometer for each mode to obtain a monetary value of accident cost&#13;
savings. The net change in accident costs across the four modes is considered&#13;
to be the overall measure of accident cost savings. Accident costs include&#13;
property damage, injuries and loss of life.&#13;
{[(Pass-km (w/o)),1,000 - (Pass-km (w)X)1,000J x ACC x PHF x ND)  1,000,&#13;
where ACC are accident cost savings per 1000 passenger kilometer.&#13;
(b)    Air pollution cost savings are measured for bus and cars by the difference&#13;
between the moming peak passenger-kilometers carried without the project and&#13;
those carried with the project. These peak-hour estimates are deflated by the&#13;
average vehicle occupancy (to obtaiin costs per vehicle-kilometer) then&#13;
converted to annual values, and finally multiplied by the assumed values of air&#13;
pollution costs per vehicle-kilometer to obtain a monetary value of air pollution&#13;
cost savings. The air pollution factor (US$/gram) of emission reduction)&#13;
represents the total health and welfare benefits associated with the reduced&#13;
pollution emissions resulting from the proposed investments. Health benefits&#13;
include reduced morbidity and mortality whereas welfare benefits include the&#13;
reductions in soiling and corrosion of buildings and other structures. The net&#13;
change in air pollution costs in the bus and car modes is considered to be the&#13;
overall measure of air pollution cost savings. The set of air pollutants considered&#13;
include carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOX),&#13;
sulphur oxides (SOx) and fine particulate matter (PM1 0).&#13;
{([Pass-km (w/o) - Pass-km (w)] x APC x PHF x ND) AOF)}, 1,000 x where&#13;
APC are air pollution cost savings per passenger-kilometer and AOF is the&#13;
average vehicle occupancy factor.&#13;
E. Costs&#13;
17.          Investment  Costs.  Investment  cost           Shadow Price Factors&#13;
components were grouped for the economic evaluation into    Iem                  Pie&#13;
civil works, permanent way, operating systems, rolling    Foreign Exchange         1.0&#13;
stock, and costs of projects and studies. Annex 8 contains    Rail Investments     0.9&#13;

subtracted from the total costs (including physical and price contingencies) shown in Annex 8 and&#13;
multiplied by a shadow value factor of 0.9. The shadow price factors are bases on estimates prepared&#13;
and used by SEAIN and BNDES in recent projects.&#13;
18.          Operating Costs. The incremental operating costs due to the investments are wages&#13;
and salaries, materials, energy and general expenditures (e.g., auditing, legal costs, transport, and&#13;
cleaning services).&#13;
19.          Discount Rate. In calculating the net present value for the underground and rail&#13;
integration components of the project a discount rate must be selected which represents the opportunity&#13;
cost of capital in Brazil. The discount rate used as "benchmarkN by SEAIN (Secretary of Planning) for&#13;
foreign investments, as well as COFIEX (Commission of Extemal Financing) is 10 percent.&#13;
F. Results of Economic Evaluation&#13;
20.          Internal economic rates of return (IERR), net present values (NPV), and Benefit/Cost&#13;
ratios (B/C) were calculated. The assumed project life is 25 years. Residual values were estimated at the&#13;
end of the project life for the civil works, permanent way, operating systems and rolling stock. These&#13;
residual values were calculated following FLUMITRENS accounting procedures that assume a linear&#13;
depreciation rate, which vary according to the expected operational life of the components.&#13;
Distribution of Costs and Benefits&#13;
21.          Table 9.6 shows the annual series of expected benefits and costs for the proposed&#13;
project in the base case scenario.&#13;
Net Present Values&#13;
22.          The discounted expected present value of benefits for both investments net of costs, are&#13;
positive in the relevant range, which includes the discount rate of 10 percent are given in Table 9.6.&#13;
Intemal Economic Rates of Return&#13;
23.          The estimated IERR for the base case is given in Table 9.6.&#13;
First-year Benefit Test&#13;
24.          A "first-year" benefit test was performed to assess whether the investments are&#13;
premature. Table 9.10 show the results of the test for discount rates of 10 percent and 12 percent. For&#13;
both discount rates the proposed investments have benefits larger than the rate of discount multiplied by&#13;
the net present value of total investment costs in the planned year of start-up of operations. This&#13;
suggests that there are no additional net benefits to be gained if the implementation of the project is&#13;
delayed from the schedule assumed in the base case scenario.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values&#13;
25.          A sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the variance of the IERR in relation to&#13;
the calculated value (base case) if deviations occur in the major benefit and cost components (travel&#13;
time savings, operating cost savings, wages and salaries, general expenditures, investment costs). Table&#13;
9.7 shows the results. The switching values are shown at Table 9.8. The cases tested in the sensitivity&#13;
analysis of the financial evaluation were tested also and the results are shown at Table 9.9.&#13;
Results by Corridor&#13;
26.          An economic evaluation by corridor was performed to investigate the IERR of all&#13;
corridors. Table 9.11 shows the IERR, NPV and BenefiVCost ratios (B/C) for each corridor for the base&#13;
case, best case and worst case.&#13;
Qualitative Analysis of the Infrastructure and Equipment Component&#13;
27.          Table 9.12 is an impact matrix which summarizes the impact of the proposed investment&#13;
on a number of aspects which could not be quantified in the standard benefit cost analysis.&#13;

RIO DE JANEIRO MASS TRANSIT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX IOA&#13;
FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
1.           Past Financial Performance. The Companhia Fluminense de Trens Urbanos&#13;
(Flumitrens) was, formed as a separate company fully owned by the State of Rio de Janeiro on December&#13;
22, 1994. Previous to the formation of Flumitrens, the suburban railway services in the Rio de Janeiro&#13;
Metropolitan Region (RJMR) were provided by Companhia Brasilera de Trens Urbanos (CBTU), a&#13;
company of the Federal Government. As part of the decentralization policy for the suburban railways, the&#13;
Federal Government restructured the Balance Sheet of Flumitrens thereby absorbing all outstanding&#13;
liabilities while agreeing to finance the ongoing investment program aimed at expanding the system's&#13;
capacity (CBTU/BNDES Program)4. Under CBTU, STU-RJ (Superintendency for Rio de Janeiro), highly&#13;
depended upon federal subsidies to meet its operating deficits, to service its debt and to undertake&#13;
capital investments. While Flumitrens, as well, would continue to depend on external cash infusions, as&#13;
part of its own financial restructuring, the State of Rio de Janeiro has made an important decision: to&#13;
increase the efficiency of the system by concessioning it to the private sector. The operating subsidies&#13;
are, therefore, expected to fall.&#13;
2.            From a high of 940 thousand paying passengers per day reached in 1984 (CBTU took&#13;
over the system that year), the ridership has continued to drop every year. By 1995, it had dropped by 54&#13;
percent to 370 thousand passengers, a decline of 5 percent per year. The paying ridership is further&#13;
expected to decline to below 300 mark during 1996 mainly due to capacity constraints. In July 1996,&#13;
there were only 74 trains providing the service while more than 200 stood paralyzed due to lack of spare,&#13;
parts, accidents, and overhauls. The deficiencies of the system go beyond rolling stock to permanent&#13;
way, signaling, and stations. About 17 percent of the revenue is lost to evasion and another amount&#13;
estimated to be 5-10 percent is not recovered due to high level of ticket fraud.&#13;

3.            A combination of historically low tariffs and declining ridership led to a gradual erosion of&#13;
Flumitrens' earning capacity. With about 134 million trips in 1995, Flumitrens received about US$186&#13;
million in operational subsidies that year to cover its working expenditures of US$223 million. .The&#13;
resulting working ratio was thus 6.12 and the internally generated revenues were barely enough to cover&#13;
16 percent of the working costs. Personnel expenses were responsible for about 85 percent of the&#13;
working costs with the parts and materials costing four percent of the working cost . The remainder of the&#13;
working cost covered administrative expense, energy cost, and other miscellaneous expenditures.&#13;
4.            Since the takeover of the system by the State, Flumitrens has made a strong effort to&#13;
reduce its staffing costs. Between 1995 and 1996, about 2,000 employees were let go through various&#13;
incentive programs which were financed directly by the State Government. As a result, the salary budget&#13;
is expected to decrease by 16 percent between 1995-1996. Nonetheless, the overall working costs is not&#13;
expected to go down much as the difference would be picked up by maintenance which had been&#13;
ignored until now in order to pay the salaries.&#13;
5.             Besides the staff reduction program, the Fluimitrens management is in the process of&#13;
taking other steps to rationalize payroll. Extra benefits (e.g., overtime) is expected to be reduced by 10&#13;
percent in 1997 and another 25 percent when the concessionaire takes over the system in 1998. The&#13;
responsibility for ticket sales in key stations is in the process of being passed to the private sector under&#13;
a management contract for provision of ticket salesmen (There are some examples which already exist&#13;
on Niteroi line). This is expected to greatly reduce the ticket fraud. However, the railway would have to&#13;
begin to raise revenues if it were ever to achieve financial independence. The current investment&#13;
progirams directly aim at increasing the system capacity and thus would allow Flumitrens to capture long-&#13;
distance commuter demand.&#13;
6.            Financial Projections. With the proposed irnprovement and integration of the mass&#13;
transit network, which will start by mid-1998, annual traffic is expected to reach in excess of 426 million&#13;
passengers by 2001-an increase of more than 217 percent over 1995. The operating revenue is&#13;
expected to increase four-fold over the same period to US$210 million compared to US$35 million in&#13;
1995. This expected increase in the revenue is brought about by: (a) newly generated ridership due to&#13;
increiased system capacity; (b) rationalization of general tariff structure; and (c) integration of Flumitrens&#13;
with other transport modes (metro and bus) which would result in about 15 percent of the trips. The bus&#13;
routes are expected to be redesigned in order to feed the railway system. The improved Flumitrens is&#13;
expetcted to have an advantage of 15-30 minutes over other competitive modes while maintaining below&#13;
market tariffs.&#13;
Working Costs are cash expenditures that do not include depreciation, deferred expenses, interest charges, and tax.&#13;

7.            With increased and enhanced service, tariffs are generally expected to increase in order&#13;
to better reflect the true economic value of the system and thus increase the availability of internally&#13;
generated funds. However, the proposed increase in average tariff-from US$0.34 in 1996 to US$0.49 in&#13;
2001-is chiefly achieved by cutting evasion and fraud. The standard tariff itself is expected to increase&#13;
modestly-from US$0.50 in 1996 to US$0.55 in 1988-2002 (in constant 1996 US$)-due largely because&#13;
of social reasons. The major factor responsible for high farebox revenues would be an increase in the&#13;
ridership. It is important that the integrated tariffs (rail + bus, rail + metro) be competitive with the through&#13;
bus tariff in order to have a successful integration of different transport modes.&#13;
8.            Operating expenses are expected to increase after a period of slow demand in 1997-&#13;
1998. The number of staff, used as a proxy for out-sourcing, is expected to increase as a result. The&#13;
staffing estimates are generally considered conservative; it is possible that actual staffing costs&#13;
(including out sourcing) are less due to an increase in labor productivity (In the case of the railway&#13;
concessions in Argentina, labor productivity increased four-fold). Similarly, expenditure on maintenance&#13;
is expected to increase with increased car-km which are expected to double between 1996-2001.&#13;
9.           Major Financial Forecast Assumptions. The financial forecast is based on January&#13;
1996 values and uses 1995 as the base year. To develop the financial forecast, the following major&#13;
assumptions were considered in addition to Flumitrens' past financial performance.&#13;
-     Ridership is mainly constrained by capacity. As more trains are put on the system during&#13;
1996-2002, ridership is expected to grow: from 398,000 per day in 1996 to 1,400,000 per&#13;
day in 2002. Growth in revenues is expected to be above the growth in passengers due&#13;
to a drastic reduction in fraud and evasion.&#13;
Average tariff is expected to increase in real terms during 1996-2002 from US$0.34 to&#13;
US$0.49. This increase is mostly due to: (a) a reduction in the evasion - from 22&#13;
percent to 5 percent; (b) a decrease in public service commitments as a percentage of&#13;
total ridership; and (c) a small increase in the standard tariff - from US$0.50 to&#13;
US$0.55.&#13;
*     Private concessionaire is expected to take over the system as of January 1, 1998;&#13;
Non-operational income is expected to reach four percent of the operational income by&#13;
2001, including income from advertisement. These results are similar to those observed&#13;
in other rapid transit systems;&#13;
*     Personnel expenses are expected to rise by 3 percent per annum during the projection&#13;
period. This is in addition to the increase in personnel cost due to added employment.&#13;
*     Energy cost is assumed to vary directly in proportion to car-km during the projection&#13;
period.&#13;
*     Spare and material cost is expected to increase at 2.25 times more than the change in&#13;
car-km to enhance its participation in the working costs. The low level of maintenance&#13;
expenditure is the major reason for the lack of system capacity.&#13;
*     Staffing numbers were used from the Flumitrens' reorganization study. These numbers&#13;
are considered high but were used in the projections as compensation for sourcing out&#13;
the services&#13;
*     Allowances are expected to be cut by 10 percent in 1997 and another 25 percent in 1998&#13;
when the concessionaire takes over the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                               ANNEX IOA&#13;
The financial analysis does not include the cost of 185 additional persons plus their&#13;
related operating expenses who will form part of Flumitrens Holding; responsible for&#13;
monitoring the Concession. The estimated costs for Flumitrens Holding are in the order&#13;
of US$6-8 million per year.&#13;
10.          Sensitivity Analysis. The financial forecast is highly dependent on the ridership&#13;
projectiions which in turn are based on the availability of train capacity. Given the past financial&#13;
constraints faced by CBTU/Flumitrens, the achievement of the financial goals is directly linked to the&#13;
ability of the State Government to concession at the agreed date. In the absence of a complete&#13;
concession, extensive private sector participation in the operations, management, and maintenance&#13;
would be required.&#13;
11.          In the worst possible case, in which the State fails to concession the system or attract&#13;
major private sector participation, the financial position of Flumitrens is not expected to improve much&#13;
over its current performance. On the other hand if there is just a delay in the concession by one year, the&#13;
State would be required to pump in an additional US$365 during the forecast period. In this particular&#13;
case, the railway is not expected to be profitable (on cash basis) until the year 2004. The biggest&#13;
concern, however, is the failure of the ridership to materialize to the levels expected, with or without the&#13;
concession. In the case that the projected demand is overstated by 25 percent, the railway would require&#13;
an additional US$238 million in operating subsidies.&#13;
12.          The railway is, however, expected to benefit frorn a reduction in its employment due to&#13;
possible out-sourcing of major services and because of morie efficient use of labor. In this case,&#13;
productivity level of labor is 25 percent higher than the forecast, the railway is expected to generate extra&#13;
cash of about US$132 million. If the tariffs were also allowed to rise in conjunction with the improvement&#13;
is the quality of service, the railway is expected to contribute to the State treasury rather than taking in&#13;
external infusions of cash. Results of the Sensitivity Analysis are shown in Table IOA.12.&#13;
13.           Financial Rate of Return. The IRR was calculated on the basis of conditions that would&#13;
exist in the absence of the proposed project (or the current conditions would continue). In doing so,&#13;
certain assumptions were made: the staff reduction program would not progress further and the level of&#13;
staff would continue to be at 5,800 which existed in July 1996. Similarly, the farebox revenues would be&#13;
lower because of: (a) persistent evasion; (b) lower tariff (at US$0.50); (c) lack of integration among&#13;
differenit modes of transport; and (d) lower production capacity. Based on these assumptions, the IRR&#13;
was calculated to be 13 percent for an investment return over the seven years; 33 percent if the return&#13;
period were increased to 10 years and 35 percent thereafter.&#13;

RIO DE JANEIRO MASS TRANSIT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX IOB&#13;
STATE FINANCES&#13;
1.            Program Seffing. The present administration, w/hich took office on January 1, 1995,&#13;
inheritecl a difficult financial situation, with large commitments to personnel, a heavy debt burden and a&#13;
major loss-making bank. The state's overextended civil service consumed 84 percent of state revenues&#13;
in 1995. State debt, excluding the liabilities of the state bank, totaled Rs.$7.3 billion, equal to 1.4 times&#13;
state revenues (all values are expressed in prices of December 1996). Of this, 70 percent consisted of&#13;
high-cost state bonds, which bore a real annual interest rate of 33 percent in 1995. The administration&#13;
responded by freezing hiring, cutting investments and taking advantage of the federal govemment's&#13;
willingness to permit interest on state bonds to be capitalized. As a result, in 1996, the state was&#13;
successlul in holding personnel costs to their 1995 level (as a percent of revenues) and maintaining&#13;
investment spending at a minimal seven percent of revenues. The state's debt stock, however,&#13;
continued to grow. Due to the capitalization of unpaid interest on state bonds, new borrowing to finance&#13;
arrears to personnel, and growth in the stock of arrears themselves, the state's total stock of debt&#13;
increased to Rs.$8.3 billion by the end of 1996.&#13;
2.            The state's recent debt agreement with the federal government (whose protocol was&#13;
initialed in January 1997) particularly affected its stock of debt and its prospects in fiscal improvement.&#13;
Under the agreement, the state's bond debt, along with certain other existing contractual debts, will be&#13;
transfomed into a 30 year debt to the federal treasury. As part of the agreement, however, the state is&#13;
required to acknowledge Rs.$6.3 billion in liabilities arising from its ownership of the state bank Banco&#13;
do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (BANERJ). This will be included in the package of refinanced debt, and will&#13;
roughly double the amount of outstanding state contractual and bonded debt. Under the agreement, the&#13;
state is required to make an upfront transfer of assets to the federal government, which will be partly&#13;
used to reduce the initial stock of debt. The state estimates the value of assets to be transferred (net of&#13;
the amount the state can use to service debt) at Rs.$2.0 billion. Even if this valuation prevails, the state's&#13;
total debt will grow to Rs.$13 billion.&#13;
3.            The interest rate on the refinanced debt will range from six percent to 7.5 percent&#13;
depending on the ultimate valuation of the assets transferred by the state. Even at 7.5 percent, this&#13;
represents a substantial drop in the state's average cost of funds. In terms of its impact on debt service,&#13;
however, it is not large enough to offset the growth in the stock of debt due to the incorporation of&#13;
BANERJ liabilities.&#13;
4.            Debt service on the refinanced debt, along with debt service from earlier reschedulings,&#13;
will be subject to a debt service cap of 13 percent of net recurrent revenues. Due to transitional clauses&#13;
in the debt agreement, the effective debt ceiling in 1997 will be about ten percent of revenues, rising to&#13;
11.5 percent of revenues in 1998. The stock of debt is therefore expected to grow, due to the&#13;
capitalization of debt service above the 13 percent ceiling. At the same time, arrears are expected to&#13;
increase. Even with the 13 percent ceiling, the state will be required to increase its cash outlays for debt&#13;
service. Given the rigidity of its other spending obligations, the state is likely to finance this through&#13;
increased arrears.&#13;
5.            The project will also monitor the state's investment program and fiscal performance&#13;
during the! disbursement period. This is not designed to induce improvement in the state's fiscal&#13;
situation. As noted earlier, the inability of the federal-state debt negotiations to produce a sustainable&#13;
workout6 renders the objective of state fiscal recovery temporarily nmoot. The intent of fiscal monitoring&#13;
e As seen in Table I OB-2, due to the model design, the debt:revenue ratio for 1996 already reflects the state-federal governments&#13;
debt deal concluded on January 15,1997 (i.e., the 1996 debt:revenue ratio is calculated as the stock of debt as of December 31,&#13;
1996, divided by revenues in 1996.&#13;

is merely to permit the Bank to halt disbursements of project funds in the event that the state engages in&#13;
reckless fiscal behavior.&#13;
6.             Two sets of fiscal indicators will be      Table 106.1 Program of Major Investments, 1997&#13;
monitored. The first is the size and quality of the state's  (Rs.$ Million of Jan 1,1997  financing&#13;
investment program. Here, the intent is to enable the                               loan   state&#13;
Bank to halt disbursements if the state undertakes  METRO                               220 &#13;
major capital works whose lack of economic or social  BAIA GUANABARA                           24&#13;
justification violates the overall objectives of the project.                            60    2&#13;
To implement this condition, the state and the Bank  BAIXADAVIVA                        60      6&#13;
have reached agreement on a list of major investments  PET (Mass transit)               51    51&#13;
to be undertaken during 1997, and the proportions of  Prosanear, Promoradia,             38     -&#13;
those projects that will be financed from debt and from   Other major investments             100&#13;
the state's own resources. The list of major projects  Total                            603   181&#13;
and their financing sources is shown in the table below.&#13;
The state's compliance with this program will be a condition of disbursement for the time slice of&#13;
January-June 1998 and for the time slice related to the water and sanitation reforms.&#13;
7.             The second set of fiscal indicators refers to the state's overall fiscal performance. While&#13;
little improvement in the state's fiscal situation is expected, this provision will permit the Bank to halt&#13;
disbursements if the state engages in actions that result in substantial fiscal deterioration. To implement&#13;
this provision, the Bank and the government have agreed on a 'most likely" fiscal prognosis for the&#13;
state, based on a detailed examination of the factors that will affect each of the major items of receipts&#13;
and expenditures: GDP growth, tax effort, the number and salaries of personnel, investment spending,&#13;
and likely receipts from privatization and new borrowing. These have been incorporated into a detailed&#13;
fiscal projection for 1997. To facilitate supervision, the Bank and the government have agreed to use&#13;
two summary indicators as measures of fiscal performance:  the operational surplus (deficit)7 as a&#13;
percent of revenue, and the ratio of the stock of debte to revenue.  Based on fairly optimistic&#13;
assumptions--e.g., that (a) GDP will grow 4 percent; (b) tax effort will increase 3 percent; (c) total&#13;
personnel costs will drop three percent; and (d) investment spending will be largely limited to the major&#13;
projects cited in table 3.1--the target for the operational deficit in 1997 was fixed at 35 percent of net&#13;
revenues. The target for the debt stock:revenue measure was fixed at 2.85:1.&#13;
8.             To place these results in perspective, the fiscal projection was extended through the year&#13;
2002. As shown in Table IOB-2, the fiscal outlook for the state is unpromising. While the state would&#13;
achieve a primary surplus in 1999, debt service on contractual debt would remain high--at about 25&#13;
percent of revenues. As a result, the operational deficit would decline only slowly, reaching -12 percent&#13;
of revenues in 2002. As much of state's debt service would be deferred under the debt service ceiling,&#13;
the resulting accumulation of deferred interest would slow the rate of decline in the stock of contractual&#13;
debt. In 2002, the stock of contractual debt would be 224 percent of net revenues.&#13;
9.             Arrears are also expected to grow. The combination of stubbomly high personnel costs&#13;
and undeferrable debt service produced a cash flow deficit equal to five percent of revenues in 1996.&#13;
Projected growth in investment spending in 1997 and 1998 wili widen the gap. The accumulation of&#13;
arrears (including the capitalization of interest on arrears) is projected to produce a total debt stock equal&#13;
to 291 percent of revenue in 2002.&#13;
10.           It should be emphasized that projections for the outer years are extremely speculative.&#13;
It is particularly likely that the state will be forced to find a means to balance receipts and expenditures&#13;
7   The operational surplus (deficit) is defined as net current revenues, less the sum of (a) accrued interest obligations (including&#13;
deferred interest), (b) other recurrent expenditures, and (c) capital expenditures, excluding amortization but including capital works&#13;
financed from privatization or borrowing.&#13;
8   Debt includes contractual debt (including debt refinanced under the recent debt agreement) and any net increase in arrears from&#13;
January 1, 1996. Debt is measured as at December 31, 1997.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RIO DE JANEIRO MASS TRANSIT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE, MONITORING, EVALUATION&#13;
AND SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
A. Project Implementation Schedule&#13;
1.           The implementation schedule for individual components are shown in Annex 8. Those&#13;
schedules and the detailed cost tables of Annex 8 provide the basis for project monitoring and for the&#13;
disbursement profile.&#13;
2.           Implementation Monitoring. Flumitrens will monitor compliance with the individual&#13;
implementation schedules by defining target dates for key actions. The target dates for key actions for&#13;
the first two years of the project (to about mid-1997) are shown in the Action Plan in this Annex. In&#13;
November of each year Flumitrens will prepare, with the agreement of the Bank, a similar action plan for&#13;
the following year of implementation, and so on throughout the life of the project. In the event of delays,&#13;
Flumitrens will be responsible for identification of the constraints and for devising and executing policies&#13;
to resolve problems.&#13;
3.           Financial progress will be monitored by Flumitrens in the same manner as&#13;
implementation progress. Estimates of costs of Part A have been made but final costs will be dependent&#13;
on consultants' final engineering designs and on bid prices (for equipment etc.). Thus, it will be the&#13;
responsibility of Flumitrens to update cost schedules as contracts and bids are finalized and to monitor&#13;
financial progress in relation to the updated schedules.&#13;
4.           Flumitrens will report on both implementation and financial progress in the biannual&#13;
progress reports.&#13;
S.           Evaluation of Part A of the project will attempt to determine the extent to which original&#13;
construction schedules and costs are respected.&#13;
B. Monitoring and Evaluation of Project Components&#13;
6.           Monitoring would identify the physical, institutional and financial status of each&#13;
subproject component, as appropriate, on a periodic basis. The aim would be to identify implementation&#13;
problems and the extent of deviation from the targets proposed at appraisal. The results of the&#13;
monitoring program (the comparison of achieved performance with appraisal targets) will be presented in&#13;
the biannual Progress Reports prepared and coordinated by Flumitrens. The results of each&#13;
subcomponent monitoring program will provide the basis and information for implementing agencies to&#13;
prepare measures and actions to resolve implementation problems, if any, and at the same time, to&#13;
update project costs, disbursement and implementation schedules if necessary. Monitoring indicators to&#13;
be employed will vary by type of component but the general guidelines are set out in the following&#13;
paragraphs.&#13;
7.           The general guidelines given below would be followed:&#13;
(a)   each implementing agency would prepare, as part of its component preparation&#13;
report, an implementation schedule which sets out target dates for key actions&#13;
for physical works, equipment supply and institutional components. Where&#13;
components are not fully prepared at appraisal, it would be a condition of their&#13;
subsequent inclusion that an implementation schedule be prepared as an&#13;
integral part of the component;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108                                ANNEX 11&#13;
(b)   for physical works (and equipment) progress the implementation schedule will&#13;
define target dates (to the nearest quarter) for the start and finish of key actions&#13;
involved in the implementation of physical works (and supply of equipment).&#13;
Thus indicators are likely to include:&#13;
(i)    start/finish dates for final engineering design and documents for works&#13;
(or equipment);&#13;
(ii)    date of issue of bid documents;&#13;
(iii)   date of contract signature; and&#13;
(iv)   start/finish dates for works (or supply of equipment).&#13;
(c)   for financial performance since works (or supply of equipment) are likely to&#13;
extend over some time, the component implementation schedule will also be&#13;
required to give target "percentage completed" by quarter. Thus target&#13;
expenditures can be estimated and will be used to monitor financial&#13;
(disbursement) performance on a quarterly basis;&#13;
(d)   for institutional measures (technical assistance, training and studies), the&#13;
monitoring targets will be the progress reports and the dates of completion&#13;
indicated in the implementation plan of Annex 7; and&#13;
(e)    monitoring of property values in the area of influence of the Flumitrens before,&#13;
during and after construction.&#13;
8.           Ex-post evaluation would be aimed at determining the effectiveness and efficiency of&#13;
measures in meeting the objectives determined at appraisal. In the event that objectives are not met and&#13;
previously anticipated improvements in performance are not achieved, the data would be used: (a) to&#13;
identify wvhy components had not been fully successful; and (b) to modify future components proposed&#13;
for subsequent implementation which were based on similar premises. Furthermore, the ex-post&#13;
evaluatic,n would be used as a major input to the Project Implementation Report.&#13;
9.           Quantitative performance targets have been established for Flumitrens and are shown&#13;
below.&#13;

10.          The qualitative monitoring indicators will be: (a) the date of the establishment of the&#13;
Regional Transport Coordination Commission as compared to the agreed date in Section IV of the main&#13;
text and its effectiveness in meeting the basic objectives described in Annex 3; (b) date of submission of&#13;

recommendations which should take place before the Mid-term Project Review; (c) the pace of the&#13;
implementation of the intermunicipal bus integration plan after with Flumitrens measured by the&#13;
additional number of lines integrated at stations; and (d) the results of a train user survey, to be carried&#13;
out every two years after effectiveness until project completion, by an independent firm, to gauge the&#13;
satisfaction of the users with the level of service offered by the system. All the above qualitative&#13;
monitoring indicators would be rated on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 5 (excellent).&#13;
11.           Bank Supervision. The main emphasis during the initial project phase would be to: (a)&#13;
review the development and implementation of the project monitoring system; (b) make certain that&#13;
Flumitrens' staff is familiar with Bank procurement guidelines, Bank disbursement procedures (i.e.,&#13;
Special Account transactions), and Bank independent auditing requirements; (c) ensure that all steps&#13;
towards decentralization of Flumitrens to the State are being taken; and (d) help Flumitrens/AMTU's&#13;
development of a strategy to properly promote the project to the RJMR public. Many of these items&#13;
would be addressed in the first supervision mission scheduled for January 1997. During project&#13;
implementation, the supervision missions would need to conduct the following activities in the field on a&#13;
regular basis in addition to monitoring project progress: (a) review a sampling of contract bids and&#13;
awards; (b) inspect disbursement procedures and record-keeping; (c) inspect adequacy of supervision&#13;
and monitoring of the implementing agencies and respective subprojects; (d) review performance and&#13;
accuracy of the Project Monitoring System; and (e) complete a Mid-term Review 24 months after project&#13;
effectiveness to examine the progress made, especially in the Integrated Land Use, Urban Transport,&#13;
and Air Quality Strategy and policies to assess the relevance of project objectives and actions, and&#13;
recommend appropriate revisions (as needed). Supervision missions in the field should attempt to visit&#13;
all the agencies dealing with the project during each trip. A preliminary schedule of supervision missions&#13;
including key activities is indicated in the table on the following page. The key activities shown are in&#13;
addition to the regular supervision needs, which include a review of: (a) progress reports; (b)&#13;
procurement issues; (c) disbursements; (d) Project Implementation Plan; (e) project costs; (f) yearly&#13;
independent audits; (g) correspondence; and (h) unforeseen issues.&#13;
12.          The Bank project team  would consist of the Task Manager (Sr. Transport Plan-&#13;
ner/Economist), a Railway Engineer and a Financial Analyst. Consultants are anticipated to be required&#13;
on a short-term basis to assist in specific areas, such as analysis of monitoring system, and review of&#13;
institutional development programs. Supervision requirements for the project are expected to be high&#13;
due to: (a) the complexity of the institutional arrangements; (b) the anticipated large number of small-&#13;
scale subprojects; and (c) the institutional weakness of Flumitrens (requiring significant training and&#13;
technical assistance). Supervision requirements are anticipated to be about 20 staff-weeks during the&#13;
first year and about 12-15 staff-weeks thereafter. A summary of key inputs is provided on the following&#13;
page.&#13;
13.           Borrower's Contribution to Supervision. Flumitrens is expected to: (a) be responsible&#13;
for project monitoring and coordination, to keep the Project Monitoring System accurate, and to follow-up&#13;
and address all issues which are "signaled" by the system; (b) be responsible for properly managing all&#13;
procurement and disbursement considerations, keeping procurement and disbursement records up to&#13;
date; (c) prepare progress reports in June and December of each year; and (d) be responsible for&#13;
coordinating arrangements for the Bank supervision missions.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RIO DE JANEIRO MASS TRANSIT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 12&#13;
THE RJMR'S SOCIAL, ECONOMICAL AND URBAN TRANSPORT CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
A. General Aspects&#13;
1.             Urban population growth in Brazil has been impressive over the past several decades.&#13;
In 1940, the urban population was about 16 percent of the total population, increasing to 65.57 percent in&#13;
1980 and to 75.60 percent in 1991. According to the Constitution, States are allowed to designate&#13;
metropolitan, micro-regions and urban conglomerates. The metropolitan regions have been organized by&#13;
grouping neighboring municipalities, in order to integrate the planning and execution of public services of&#13;
common interest. Among all the metropolitan regions, RJMR stands out from the other, because it&#13;
comprises 77 percent of the population of the State, in an area which is equivalent to 15 percent of the&#13;
State's area, and therefore, an extremely high demographic concentration.&#13;
2.             Its urbanization process took place along natural vectors, most of them without basic&#13;
infrastructure, in view of the permissive laws of land use, especially in the Baixada Fluminense. The&#13;
region's topography induced the development vectors in the same directions of the mass transport&#13;
corridors, and these, in view of the investment policy, caused an increase or decrease of those vector's&#13;
development.&#13;
B. Socio-Economical Data&#13;
- Produce about 85 percent of the income of the State of Rio de Janeiro;&#13;
- Generates 4,500,000 jobs;&#13;
* Development indicators: 1980- 1990:&#13;
- energy consumption:   52 percent residential;&#13;
43 percent commercial;&#13;
74 percent industrial;&#13;
- jobs: 22 percent; and&#13;
- The Rio de Janeiro municipality has 56 percent of the population and 77 percent of the income of the&#13;

C. Transportation System&#13;
3.                The RJMR generates about 13.18 million trips/day, 48 percent from home to work. Of&#13;
the total trips, 67 percent are by public transport, 11 percent are by auto, 20 percent are by foot and the&#13;
remaining 2 percent by other modes. The public transport trips presents the following modal split.&#13;

4.             Base on the research carried out for the Mass Transportation Plan of the RJMR (PTM -&#13;
1994), there is a very unbalanced modal split, with the buses playing the role of a structural&#13;
transportation mode, causing undesirable effects to the transportation system and therefore to the quality&#13;
of life of the region. In this context, the railway system operated by Flumitrens, presents all the potential&#13;
conditions for restructuring the transportation system, being present in 15 of the 17 municipalities that&#13;
form the RJMR, constituting a fundamental mass transport alternative, and linking all those 15&#13;
municipalities to the central area of Rio de Janeiro.&#13;
D. Flumitrens' Key Data&#13;
5.             Flumitrens' network, with an extension of 264 km (163 km electrified and in broad&#13;
gauge -1.60m, 9 km non-electrified in broad gauge, and 92 km non-electrified in 1.00m gauge), has five&#13;
main broad gauge electrified corridors: Deodoro, Japeri, Santa Cruz, Leopoldina and Belford Roxo; and&#13;
three corridors non-electrified, in metric gauge: Vila Inhomirim, Guapimirim and Niter6i.&#13;
6.             Nowadays, the daily transport is about 400,000 passengers, 95 percent in the broad&#13;
gauge system. There are 1,019 diary departures programmed, but only 80 percent of these trips are&#13;
carried out. In 1984 and 1985, about 942,000 passengers transported by working day, and taking into&#13;
account the income evasion, the total transport in working days was at that time about 1,200,000&#13;
passengers.&#13;

            Brazil - Rio de Janeiro Mass Transit Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Rio de
            Janeiro Mass Transit Project are: 1) to improve the quality
            of urban transport services in the metropolitan region
            (RJMR) by developing a fully integrated urban transport
            system; and 2) to substantially improve the level of service
            provided by the Suburban Train Company (Flumitrens) by
            reducing operating subsidies and increasing private sector
            participation in its operations and management. The project
            has two components: 1) an infrastructure and equipment
            component that rehabilitates/refurbishes Flumitrens'
            rolling stock and infrastructure and rehabilitates or builds
            transfer stations between the trains and other modes (Metro,
            buses, and ferries); and 2) an institutional and policy
            development component that helps a) support the process of
            concessioning Flumitrens to the private sector through
            technical assistance for preparing and evaluating bids; b)
            operate the Regional Transport Coordination Commission
            (RTCC) for the RJMR; c) prepare an integrated Transport
            Policy, Land Use, and Air Quality Management strategy for
            the RJMR to meet both transport and air quality targets and
            to introduce sound cost recovery, tariff, regulatory, and
            subsidy policies; d) set up a comprehensive staff retraining
            for Flumitrens; e) prepare feasibility studies and bidding
            documents for a proposed extension and other priorities of
            the mass transit system; and f) implement an Environmental
            and Traffic subcomponent.
