Water, sanitation and hygiene are vital&#13;
components of sustainable development&#13;

This Field Note, together with the others&#13;

                                             therefore necessary to find new approaches for the management of their water supplies.&#13;

                                                                          the daily consumption per person varies from approximately 5&#13;

&#13;
  Some drawbacks of community management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Community management is an extremely effective concept, especially for small-scale supplies, but its limits should be noted. Being&#13;
  inexperienced,community-basedwatercommitteestendtomanagetheirwatersuppliesattheleastcost.Theydonottrytooptimisetheir&#13;

  tominimiseexpenditure,sometimesevenattheexpenseofpreventivemaintenance.Theaccumulatedsavingsremaininabankaccount.&#13;
       Community management in principle makes it possible to reduce the salaries of the operation and maintenance workers. However,&#13;
  the actual management is often in the hands of a small group that may not be representative of all the users. This small group often&#13;
  monopolises control of the finances. Then the community management approach may translate into a compromise between the&#13;
  interests of the different social groups in an area. In the event of misappropriation, close social relations make sanctions difficult, and&#13;
  non-payment for water by some is perceived as normal. When a major breakdown occurs, the community may not be able to deal with&#13;
  it, because the savings have been spent for another purpose.&#13;

&#13;
                                                                       2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Examples and analysis&#13;
of the experiences&#13;
of small and&#13;
medium-sized operators&#13;
&#13;
    Governments generally involve operators from outside&#13;
    the public sector, whether non-profit associations or&#13;
    commercial companies, in order to improve efficiency&#13;
    of operations and transparency of accounting. The&#13;
simplest form of delegation is a management contract, in&#13;
which the operator simply runs the water services and can&#13;
be paid on merit, according to the results. Alternatively,&#13;
the operator can raise the finance for the household&#13;
connections and the extension of the distribution system.&#13;
This financial commitment constitutes a form of lease contract.&#13;
   The following experiences in five different African&#13;
countries -- Mali, Tanzania, Niger, Mauritania and Uganda&#13;
-- illustrate these types of approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Mali, a unit established by&#13;
the government supports and&#13;
advises Users' Associations                                           Between 1996 and 2000 the average price charged by&#13;
   In Mali, the government's National Water Directorate           UAs to their customers fell in real terms from US$0.55 to&#13;
contracts the operation of small-town water supplies to civil     US$0.30 per cubic metre; the variation between the prices&#13;
society groups called Users' Associations (UAs). The UAs work     charged by different UAs also reduced.&#13;
closely with a government technical unit called the Council           The model poses an apparent paradox: a surcharge&#13;
for Supply of Treated Water (CCAEP), based in Bamako.             allocated to support and advice does not entail an increase&#13;
Communicating by radio, CCAEP routinely records operational       in the price of water. On the contrary, the system makes it&#13;
details, guides the work of the UAs and, in the event of a        possible to identify and resolve the problems that are&#13;
breakdown, can dispatch spare parts. CCAEP also checks the        beyond the competence of the local operator. The latter&#13;
monthly accounts of each operator, and its staff visit biannually has to observe the schedule of preventive maintenance.&#13;
to verify the condition of the water supply systems and to        The result is that breakdowns are less frequent and last for&#13;
balance the operating accounts with the General Assembly          shorter periods. The volume of water sold increases and&#13;
of the UA. Each UA contributes to CCAEP a surcharge of            the unit cost of water produced falls.&#13;
US$0.025 per cubic metre of water produced.&#13;
   This arrangement brings together the voluntary work of         Tanzanian districts own their operations&#13;
a local association and the expertise of specialists. The         and contract out the water service&#13;
improvement in financial management is impressive. On                 In Tanzania, district governments are the owners of their&#13;
comparing the results of six operators that have been working     water sources and infrastructure. They co-finance, with the&#13;

three operators not working with CCAEP, it is noted that:         infrastructure. For example, the Morogoro District drinking&#13;
· Those working with CCAEP have an average gross                  water programme comprises 22 separate water supplies,&#13;
operating surplus of nearly US$7,000 per year, and redeem         of which 14 serve more than 5,000 people and the biggest&#13;

working with CCAEP make a loss on both counts.                    topstands. The water supplies are supervised by Water and&#13;
· Those working with CCAEP have, an average, five times           Sanitation Boards, which come under the district&#13;

3. Entering into a large contract&#13;
with a multinational company&#13;
    The government felt that a single large contract was&#13;
the appropriate method to serve the largest towns and&#13;
cities. So in June 2001, the Niger National Water Company,&#13;
SPEN, contracted to Vivendi the operation of water services&#13;
in the capital Niamey and 50 centres, the smallest of which&#13;
had 10,000 inhabitants.&#13;

Mauritanian operators reinvest&#13;
part of their profits in the&#13;
improvement of the systems1&#13;
    In 1995, the president of Mauritania prioritised the&#13;
employment of young graduates. This gave an opportunity&#13;
for the Directorate of Water to replace the existing water&#13;
service operators by new ones. These young graduates were&#13;
chosen primarily for their level of education, each one of&#13;
them becoming the concessionary in his or her area of origin.&#13;
All the country's 250 pumped water supply schemes&#13;
progressively came under private management, except&#13;
12 schemes managed by the state monopoly.&#13;
                                                                                    The old and the new in Mauritania: a conventional tapstand is&#13;

management contracts for one year, renewable at the&#13;
discretion of the government. Some of the operators&#13;
finance, from their own funds, major repairs and renewals.                        In Uganda, small companies concentrate&#13;
                                                                                  on cost control and efficient billing&#13;
Extensions of the systems are generally financed either by&#13;
                                                                                       Under the Ugandan Government's sectoral reform and&#13;

these connections would be made within three months.&#13;

But the ministry was still calling for tenders months later. It&#13;
                                                                arrangements have been chosen. The choice of operator and&#13;
appeared that the ministry had overlooked an essential          contract rests with the local government and, ultimately, the&#13;
aim: to attain, as far as possible, economies of scale for      people served. The important factor in choosing a successful&#13;
each of the towns. This may have been only a frustrating        system is to recognise the capabilities of the various types&#13;
consequence of bureaucratic procedures. However, the            of organisation and the conditions that will enable them to&#13;
resultant delay failed to take advantage of the                 operate a good-quality service to the people. The viability&#13;
resourcefulness of the Ugandan entrepreneurs who had            of this service depends on clearly written contracts that&#13;
already proved themselves.                                      define the operator's financial autonomy and obligations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                               6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Economies of scale can be&#13;
achieved in a single town&#13;
    The financial viability of a small-town water supply service&#13;
depends on the ability of the operator to attain the&#13;
appropriate economies of scale with regard to the fixed&#13;
charges. Much of the economy of scale occurs through&#13;
offsetting fixed charges against the largest possible volume&#13;
of water sold. To this end, the priorities should be to&#13;
minimise breakdown times and increase the number of&#13;
private connections. However, this does not automatically&#13;
mean that the largest operators are always the most cost&#13;
effective. For example, in Niger, an annual turnover of about&#13;
US$4,000 appears to be the break-even point for small&#13;
operators. In terms of the volume of water sold, this threshold&#13;
lies between 10,000 and 15,000 m3/year.&#13;
    This illustrates a simple principle: a small operator with&#13;
modest operating costs, which will be satisfied with fewer&#13;
benefits, can achieve profitability at a lower turnover than&#13;
a large company with high overheads. It is not always&#13;
necessary to combine a number of small-town supplies into&#13;
a single operator's contract. Well-publicised benefits of scale&#13;
such as buying fuel wholesale or having technically qualified&#13;
staff to cover several centres contribute only marginally&#13;
towards reducing the operator's unit costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Non-profit water companies&#13;
need professional support&#13;
    A water supply operator does not have to be a&#13;
commercial company. Non-profit organisations, such as the&#13;
Users' Associations in Mali, can also manage supplies. The&#13;
important characteristic of the operator is not whether it&#13;
aims to make a profit but whether it performs its task well.&#13;
    In the case of non-profit organisations, they generally&#13;
need some external professional support because they tend         Tapstand repair in Mali.&#13;
to have few professional staff themselves. The additional&#13;
cost of external professional support is compensated for by      · Carry out audits to verify the financial accounts and note&#13;

without support.                                                    There is a real risk of overcharging, especially if the&#13;

            Water services in small towns in Africa :
            the role of small and medium-sized organisations
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            There is plenty of written material
            describing the different options for water services in large
            cities. There is also a large body of knowledge about
            community management of (mostly small-scale) water supplies.
            This Field Note looks at the intermediate case of water
            supply in small towns. Millions of Africans live in small
            towns or peri-urban areas. These places are generally too
            large for community management to work effectively, but too
            small to warrant the involvement of large private companies
            or water utilities. It is therefore necessary to find new
            approaches for the management of their water supplies. In
            Mali, voluntary-sector Users Associations manage water
            services in the peri-urban areas. A parastatal organisation
            gives them technical and financial advice and support. Its
            costs are covered by a levy paid to it by the Users
            Associations, calculated in proportion to the volumes of
            water that they supply. In Mauritania, young graduate
            entrepreneurs provide water services to individual towns
            under a contract from the government. Working with the
            communities, they extend the distribution systems and
            install private connections. In Niger, a medium-sized
            private company has financed the rehabilitation of
            particular small-town water supplies and has taken over
            their operation, without any external financial support. In
            Tanzania, Uganda and parts of Niger, small local
            private-sector companies have won tenders to manage or lease
            water systems.
