&amp;#12;Acknowledgments&#13;
The Little Data Book on Private Sector Development 2007 is based on World&#13;
Development Indicators 2007 and its accompanying CD-ROM, with a focus&#13;
on the private sector in development. The Little Data Book on Private Sector&#13;
Development 2007 is the result of close collaboration between the staff of&#13;
the World Bank's Development Economics Data Group and the International&#13;
Finance Corporation's Small and Medium Enterprise Department. The Data&#13;
Group team included Uranbileg Batjargal, David Cieslikowski, Richard Fix,&#13;
Raymond Muhula, and William Prince. The Small and Medium Enterprise team&#13;
included Michael Ingram and Shokraneh Minovi. This effort benefited from&#13;
previous work led by Joyce Msuya and from additional input from Mark Dutz,&#13;
Vincent Palmade, Cherian Samuel, and Andrew Stone. The work was carried&#13;
out under the management of Shaida Badiee, Director of the Development&#13;
Data Group, and Laurence Carter, Director of the Small and Medium Enterprise&#13;
Department. Meta de Coquereaumont, Christopher Trott, and Elaine Wilson&#13;
of Communications Development Incorporated provided design, editing, and&#13;
layout. Staff from the World Bank External Affairs Department oversaw&#13;
publication and dissemination of the book.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                          Preface&#13;
Publication of this first edition of The Little Data Book on Private Sector&#13;
Development coincides with rising interest in private sector development&#13;
and growing understanding of the links between private sector development&#13;
and economic growth. Well functioning finance markets and a robust private&#13;
sector play critical roles in increasing productivity and growth and in spreading&#13;
equality of opportunity. The availability of cross-country data on the business&#13;
environment has expanded rapidly in recent years, including data from the&#13;
World Bank's Doing Business project and Enterprise Surveys. These data&#13;
sources report on the scope and types of regulations that enhance--and&#13;
constrain--business activity and provide information on business owners'&#13;
assessments of the business environment. These data have led to new&#13;
research, enabled benchmarking, and informed the reform process in many&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
Included in this guide are indicators covering the economic and social context,&#13;
the business environment, private sector investment, finance and banking,&#13;
and infrastructure. Though not all relevant variables can be included in a&#13;
pocket guide, the indicators that are included provide users with a general&#13;
understanding of the private sector in each country. Indicators displayed&#13;
in the tables are defined in the glossary, which also indicates the sources&#13;
of the data.&#13;
&#13;
We welcome your suggestions for how to improve future editions and make&#13;
them more useful.&#13;

&amp;#12;Data notes&#13;
The data in this book are for 2000 and 2005 or the most recent year unless&#13;
otherwise noted in the Glossary.&#13;
&#13;
      ·   Growth rates are proportional changes from the previous year unless&#13;
          otherwise noted.&#13;
&#13;
      ·   Regional aggregates include data for low- and middle-income&#13;
          economies only.&#13;
&#13;
      ·   Figures in italics indicate data for years or periods other than those&#13;
          specified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Symbols used:&#13;
&#13;
          ..   indicates that data are not available or that aggregates cannot&#13;
               be calculated because of missing data.&#13;
&#13;
    0 or 0.0   indicates zero or small enough that the number would round&#13;
               to zero at the displayed number of decimal places.&#13;
&#13;
          $    indicates current U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
          --   indicates not applicable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or for&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. The term country&#13;
(used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political independence&#13;
or official recognition by the World Bank but refers to any economy for which&#13;
the authorities report separate social or economic statistics.&#13;
&#13;
In keeping with World Development Indicators 2007, this edition of The Little&#13;
Data Book on Private Sector Development 2007 uses terminology in line with&#13;
the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA). In particular, gross national&#13;
product (GNP) is replaced by gross national income (GNI).&#13;

&amp;#12;                   Income group tables&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bank's main criterion&#13;
for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Every&#13;
economy is classified as low income, middle income (subdivided into&#13;
lower middle and upper middle), or high income. Low- and middle-income&#13;
economies are sometimes referred to as developing economies. The use&#13;
of the term is convenient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in&#13;
the group are experiencing similar development or that other economies&#13;
have reached a preferred or final stage of development. Classification by&#13;
income does not necessarily reflect development status.&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $875 or less&#13;
in 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than&#13;
$875 but less than $10,726. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income&#13;
economies are separated at a GNI per capita of $3,465.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $10,726 or&#13;
more.&#13;

major or very severe constraint to business in their country (all other sur-&#13;

firms as the biggest constraint even if they would be considered major or&#13;
severe. The 2006 Enterprise Surveys in Africa and Latin America--except&#13;
those in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, and Cape Verde--have weights for the&#13;
estimates of the aggregate indicators to account for the random stratified&#13;

&#13;
The constraints from which the top five are drawn are:&#13;

   · Access to land.&#13;
   · Anticompetitive or informal practices.&#13;
   · Business licensing and permits.&#13;

            Publication of this first edition of the
            little data book on private sector development coincides
            with rising interest in private sector development and
            growing understanding of the links between private sector
            development and economic growth. Well functioning finance
            markets and a robust private sector play critical roles in
            increasing productivity and growth and in spreading equality
            of opportunity. The availability of cross-country data on
            the business environment has expanded rapidly in recent
            years; including data from the World Bank's doing
            business project and enterprise surveys. These data sources
            report on the scope and types of regulations that enhance,
            and constrain, business activity and provide information on
            business owners' assessments of the business
            environment. These data have led to new research, enabled
            benchmarking, and informed the reform process in many
            developing countries.
