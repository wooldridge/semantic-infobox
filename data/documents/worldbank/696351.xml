PUBLIC SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
THE SECTOR&#13;
Macro-Economic Environment&#13;
I .    Jamaica is an island country in the Caribbean, with a total area of approximately 11,000 square&#13;
kilometers and a strong natural resource base. The economy is highly sensitive to international price&#13;
and demand changes, primarily due to the nature of its productive base and its dependence on imported&#13;
oil for commercial energy consumption. Jamaica's principal economic activities are tourism,&#13;
manufacturing, bauxite/alumina mining and, in employment terms, agriculture. It has a population of&#13;
approximately 2.5 million, with about 55% of the people living in urban areas. The labor force is&#13;
reasonably well-educated and skilled. A per capita income of US$ 1,5601, for 1994, places Jamaica in&#13;
the group of lower-middle income countries.&#13;
2.    In the decade following independence in 1962, Jamaica enjoyed strong GDP growth, averaging&#13;
about 5% per annum. However, from 1973 through the mid-1980s, the economy experienced&#13;
sustained contraction as a result of external shocks and domestic policies. Increase in oil prices; the&#13;
impact of recession in the industrialized countries on the price of sugar and alumina, the country's&#13;
major exports; and high international interest rates had a negative impact on the economy. At the same&#13;
time, the government started a process of expansion of the role of the state in national life. This&#13;
process resulted in a bloated and inefficient public sector. The overall result was an erosion of private&#13;
sector confidence, a reduction in investment and a continuous outflow of capital and human resources.&#13;
3.    In the second half of the 1980s, an effort to stem the decline resulted in stabilization programs&#13;
and a progressive adoption of market-oriented policy reforms. These efforts yielded some positive&#13;
results, with average GDP growth being 4. 1 % per annum for the period 1986-91. In the 1990s, and&#13;
particularly in the past two years, the Government accelerated the implementation of the reform&#13;
agenda. The main objectives were to lower inflation, enhance international competitiveness, improve&#13;
public finances, maintain adequate level of international reserves and increase per capita income. The&#13;
reform program has been supported by multi-lateral institutions, including the IBRD, and the Paris&#13;
Club. By mid-1995, the government had achieved significant results. A budget surplus was&#13;
maintained for four consecutive years and Bank of Jamaica losses were reduced. The foreign exchange&#13;
regime was liberalized. Inflation declined to 1 % per month. Import tariffs were brought within a&#13;
range of 5-35% and most trade monopolies and quantitative restrictions were eliminated. Reforms in&#13;
tax policy and administration were initiated. The privatization program was stepped up. The external&#13;
current account balance moved from a deticit of 7.3%' of GDP in 1991 to a near balance by end-1994.&#13;
Private transfers and capital inflows doubled, as compared to those in 1990, to approximately 22.9%'&#13;
GDP in 1994. While external debt remains high (93.6%1 of GDP in 1994), debt rescheduling reduced&#13;
debt service to more manageable levels.&#13;

4.     Despite these positive achievements, the macro-economic environment continues to be fragile,&#13;
as events since July 1995 indicate. High inflation has returned, international reserves have been drawn&#13;
down to stabilize the depreciating Jamaican Dollar, large wage awards to public servants and support&#13;
to troubled financial firms have caused the budget surplus to dwindle and external imbalances have&#13;
widened due to a jump in consumer imports, high interest rates and a weak financial sector. GDP&#13;
growth in the period 1991-95 has remained low at 1% per annum.&#13;
The Public Sector&#13;
Structure of the Public Sector&#13;
5.     The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) is constituted on the basis of a written Constitution,&#13;
adopted in 1962. Its structure closely follows the Westminster model. The Queen is the Sovereign,&#13;
represented by the Governor General. The government is made up of three independent branches.&#13;
The Legislative Branch consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Judicial Branch&#13;
consists of the Privy Council, the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court, the Resident Magistrate&#13;
Courts, the Family Court and the Revenue Court. The Executive Branch is led by the Prime Minister&#13;
who is elected by the majority party in the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister appoints&#13;
Cabinet Ministers, who head Ministries dealing with specific portfolios. In some Ministries, Ministers&#13;
of State and Parliamentary Secretaries are also appointed to assist the Cabinet Ministers. At the central&#13;
level in each Ministry are various divisions responsible for policy formulation, monitoring of&#13;
implementation, setting standards and norms and performing corporate functions, such as planning,&#13;
budgeting and accounting. Each Ministry has a number of operational Departments and Agencies,&#13;
that implement sectoral policies. In addition, it may have Statutory Bodies and Public Companies&#13;
associated with it. In the thirty three years since independence, the scope and size of the Executive&#13;
Branch has grown substantially. At present, besides the Office of the Prime Minister, there are 12&#13;
Ministries, 31 departments and agencies and more than 300 statutory bodies and public companies.&#13;
Under the Constitution, certain autonomous bodies have also been created, notably the Auditor General&#13;
and the Office of the Services Commission (OSC). Figure 1 indicates the overall organization of GOJ.&#13;
Composition of the Public Service:&#13;
6.     The regular civil service consists of approximately 30,7502 employees. In addition, 21,800&#13;
teachers, 6,800 health services workers and 11,200 security personnel, policemen and fire fighters,&#13;
though not belonging to the civil service, are a part of the central establishment. There are an&#13;
estimated 13,870 employees in other public sector entities. In general, employees of these entities are&#13;
paid more than employees on the central establishment, but enjoy lesser security of tenure. The public&#13;
sector accounted for 14% of jobs in the 1980s and, even after subsequent downsizing, it represents 7%&#13;
of jobs in the economy. Expenditure on personnel is the government's largest single recurrent cost&#13;
item after interest payments. The wage bill for FY 1996-97, including retroactive payments, would be&#13;
J$22.72 billion, or 64%2 of non-debt recurrent expenditures.&#13;
7.     The regular civil service in Jamaica is patterned on the traditional British model.&#13;
Appointments are made through the OSC. The civil service serves the government of the day,&#13;
regardless of which party forms the government. It is expected to provide objective and impartial&#13;

advice to the political executive, help formulate policies in accordance with the priorities of the&#13;
government and, thereafter, ensure that these are efficiently implemented. The service is accountable&#13;
to Parliament through the Ministers. In order to ensure its independence, the civil service has been&#13;
granted considerable security of tenure. Normally, civil servants can be removed only after protracted&#13;
disciplinary proceedings in which the OSC is closely involved (removal in the context of a&#13;
reorganization is relatively easier). The Cabinet Secretary heads the civil service. The Financial&#13;
Secretary is responsible for the administration of the Ministry of Finance and Planning. All other&#13;
Ministries are headed by Permanent Secretaries at the administrative level.&#13;

Current Performance of the Public Sector&#13;
8.     In spite of its numerous agencies and employees, the performance of the public sector is&#13;
inadequate in many critical areas. The general level of efficiency and effectiveness of public entities is&#13;
very low. The quality of service to the public is poor and is characterized by cumbersome procedures,&#13;
long delays, unsatisfactory resolution of problems faced by clients, high private costs of compliance&#13;
with laws and regulations, discourteous behavior and indifference to the convenience of the public.&#13;
Public enterprises engaged in commercial ventures are, with a few exceptions, unprofitable, badly&#13;
managed and uncompetitive. They are also a recurrent fiscal burden on the exchequer. The public&#13;
perception of government was summed up by the Report of the Committee of Advisors on Government&#13;
Structure, also known as the Nettleford Report 3, as follows:&#13;
I .. considerable concerns have been expressed about the poor quality of government in&#13;
Jamaica. These largely centered around over-concentration of decision-making, which&#13;
consigned the rest of the community to a largely peripheral role in the management of affairs;&#13;
the low quality of the civil service; and the over-bureaucratization of its methods of work&#13;
leading to a compliance rather than service orientation in its dealings with the public. In&#13;
general the impression conveyed was of an over-manned, slow, lumbering bureaucracy&#13;
characterized by low morale..... "&#13;
Factors Affecting Public Sector Performance&#13;
A.     Scope of the Public Sector&#13;
9.     Starting with the 1970's, government ventured into a large number of economic and&#13;
commercial activities which were far removed from its core functions. This was in line with the then&#13;
prevailing thinking that economic development required active involvement of the government in the&#13;
productive sectors, the establishment of government owned enterprises, subsidies to the private sector&#13;
and heavy protection of industries engaged in import substitutions. Some of the areas that public&#13;
enterprises became involved in included: fish farming, mango orchards, distilleries, housing&#13;
construction, shopping centers, hotels, hospital laundry, airlines, old-age homes, petrochemicals,&#13;
garment manufacturing and so on. In most of these areas the public sector has no comparative&#13;
advantage over the private sector. On the contrary, in the majority of cases, it positively lacks the&#13;
skills and incentives needed to run these business enterprises efficiently. This has resulted in low&#13;
efficiency and productivity in many government agencies. Since the early 1980's, GOJ has actively&#13;
taken up a systematic program of privatization to reduce the scope of the public sector. However, the&#13;
scope of the public sector still remains very wide.&#13;
B.     Size of the Public Sector&#13;
10.    For a population of 2.5 million, Jamaica has about 350 public institutions including Ministries,&#13;
departments, agencies, statutory bodies and public corporations. Far from contributing to efficiency,&#13;
the proliferation of entities has caused a deterioration of public sector performance. With the&#13;
establishment of various statutory bodies and public companies, many functions have been transferred&#13;
from regular government departments to these entities. Since many of the heads of these bodies report&#13;

directly to the minister concerned, this has caused a steady erosion of the ability of the Permanent&#13;
Secretary (PS), who is the administrative linchpin of a Ministry, to contribute to policy formulation&#13;
and monitoring and control of activities falling within the Ministry's purview. Even where line entities&#13;
report to the PS, their sheer number extends beyond her/his span of control, causing a serious&#13;
breakdown in financial and operational accountability. Further, the plethora of entities has made inter-&#13;
ministerial and inter-agency coordination very difficult. It has also caused duplication of functions and&#13;
overlapping authority. From the administrative point of view this means wastage of resources and&#13;
jurisdictional contlicts. For the citizen, it means dealing with multiple authorities for getting even&#13;
simple things done.&#13;
C.     Bureaucratic Culture&#13;
11.    The Jamaican public sector displays characteristics commonly found in most established&#13;
bureaucracies. Public Sector entities are governed by rigid rules of business. Compliance with the&#13;
rules takes precedence over achievement of organizational objectives. This reduces responsiveness to&#13;
emerging situations and discourages innovation. Decision-making is hierarchical. Superiors are&#13;
generally reluctant to delegate authority, while juniors are reluctant to use even the limited powers that&#13;
are delegated to them for fear of being penalized for mistakes that may occur in the process. The&#13;
result is that most decisions get pushed upwards and disposal of even routine matters takes a long time.&#13;
Although a beginning has been made to shift organizational emphasis from inputs to outputs and&#13;
outcomes through Program Budgeting and Corporate Planning, as yet, public sector entities are not&#13;
strictly held responsible for achieving pre-determined performance targets. The security of tenure&#13;
enjoyed by civil servants shields them from the worst consequences of poor performance. It also limits&#13;
managers' ability to enforce high productivity standards. Finally, most bureaucrats regard themselves&#13;
as policy makers, controllers or regulators, rather than facilitators. Public service orientation in day-&#13;
to-day functioning is minimal. Bureaucrats are, for the most part, indifferent to the costs and&#13;
inconvenience suffered by the public due to their inefficiency or unresponsiveness.&#13;
D.     Human Resource Deficiencies&#13;
(i)    Low Public Service Remuneration&#13;
12.    As alluded to in the Nettleford Report, supra, the low quality of human resources is one of the&#13;
major weaknesses of the public sector. The single most important factor in this regard is low&#13;
remuneration. There is a wide gap between wages in many areas of the public sector and those in the&#13;
labor market as a whole, especially, at managerial and technical levels. Table 1 indicates the salary&#13;
differential for some key positions. Even though, parastatal bodies have a better compensation&#13;
structure, in many cases they too lag behind the private sector. The situation has been worsened by&#13;
severe salary erosion in recent years on account of inflation.&#13;
13.    Low salaries make it extremely difficult for the public sector to recruit persons with the&#13;
requisite skills, especially, for technical and managerial positions at the entry and middle levels that&#13;
require tertiary education in disciplines such as applied sciences, accounting or management. Even&#13;
when promising individuals join, they do not stay for long. The difficulty of making ends meet and&#13;
the availability of better options soon prompt their migration to the private sector, often after they have&#13;
received formal and on-the- job training at government expense. Thus, the public sector does not&#13;
attract or retain the best and brightest. Barring a few high caliber people, who remain in the public&#13;

sector either due to a personal affinity for public service, or due to promising career prospects based&#13;
upon their individual circumstances, for the most part, the public service is made up of persons who&#13;
are content to settle down in a rut - following rules, producing a little above the minimum that is&#13;
expected of them and, generally, staying out of trouble. There is a dearth of inspiring leaders, creative&#13;
problem-solvers and entrepreneurial risk-takers who would aggressively seek and produce excellence.&#13;

14.     Inadequate remuneration has led to a large number of vacancies, especially, at the key and&#13;
critical level. In 1993, there were about 3,200 vacancies in the central establishment, of which about&#13;
4CC USS  =                                          3 0 33.58 (une 25, 1996).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

725 were in key positions. In addition to the unfilled posts, there are another 3,200 positions that are&#13;
held by acting or temporary holders who, often, do not possess the skills needed for the job. The large&#13;
number of vacancies have had a damaging impact on organizational performance. Either tasks that&#13;
need to be done are not done at all, or they are done by unqualified or over-burdened individuals who&#13;
cannot do justice to them. Consequently, efficiency and the quality of service suffer.&#13;
(ii)   Inadequate Training of Public Servants&#13;
15.    GOJ has been attempting to bridge the skill gap caused by low remuneration and attrition&#13;
through in-house training. The Management Institute for National Development (MIND) is the&#13;
Government's main training institution. It was established in 1994 by the merger of four specialized&#13;
training facilities viz. Administrative Staff College, Finance and Accounting College, Secretarial and&#13;
Clerical College and the Mandeville Outreach Training Center. Training for revenue officers is&#13;
provided by the Revenue Board and the Revenue Protection Division. Although these institutions are&#13;
doing a commendable job, they face severe constraints. Curricula of many courses are old and&#13;
inappropriate for the situations being faced by public servants in the field. Teaching faculty is limited&#13;
and not fully trained. Training facilities are inadequate. As a result, the general skill level in the&#13;
public service continues to be low contributing to inefficiency and ineffectiveness.&#13;
E.    Antiquated Business Processes&#13;
16.    Both managerial and operational business processes in the public sector need re-engineering.&#13;
Most of the current business processes were established decades ago and continue unchanged, in spite&#13;
of major changes in the external environment and the role of the public sector. Many that could be&#13;
conveniently completed in one step or location are fragmented between different organizations and&#13;
between different sections in a given organization. This necessitates multiple hand-offs, from one&#13;
official or organization to another, which serve to introduce major delays without adding much value.&#13;
Also, many processes involve duplicate or infructuous work and avoidable references to higher&#13;
authorities. Operations in most departments are still pre-dominantly manual and create an environment&#13;
where officials have the discretion and ability to delay and, therefore, to extract rents. In effect,&#13;
prevailing business processes increase administrative costs for the public sector and transactions costs&#13;
for the private sector. In addition, they lead to avoidable harassment of the public.&#13;
F.     Inadequate Physical Resources&#13;
17.    The physical infrastructure in many public sector entities fails to provide a motivating work&#13;
environment. Many buildings are old and congested and lack facilities for employees. In agencies like&#13;
the Registrar General, that are custodians of important records, record-keeping facilities are&#13;
rudimentary. This affects the security of documents as well as their retrieval. In many departments&#13;
there is a dearth of operational equipment, such as communication systems for customs agents at the&#13;
airport or vehicles for agencies involved in field work. Physical resource deficiencies lower the&#13;
overall level of public sector performance.&#13;
G.     Weak Procurement, Contracting and Control Mechanisms&#13;
18.   In 1992, the Supply Division of the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) was closed down&#13;
and procurement of goods was delegated to the respective Ministries, departments and entities, with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Alodernization Projecl:: S4R: 7196                                          8&#13;
Inspectorate Division of the Ministry of Finance retaining some administrative responsibilities. Contracting&#13;
for civil works is the responsibility of the Ministry of Local Government and Works, although several&#13;
Ministries and departments manage their own construction projects. The Contractor-General, a public&#13;
statutory body, is responsible tor overseeing and investigating all aspects of contracts relating to civil works.&#13;
Under the Contractor General's Act he does not have any executive authority and can only report his&#13;
findings to Parliament. However, recently steps have been intitated to amend this Act and enhance the&#13;
authority of the Contractor General. The procurement of services is currently done by all Ministries and&#13;
departments.&#13;
19.    Since the decentralization of procurement, there has been no government body officially designated&#13;
to coordinate procurement policies and regulations regarding goods, works and services and to monitor their&#13;
implementation. Although the Ministry of Finance has retained some responsibility with regard to the&#13;
administration of procurement of goods, it does not have the required professional resources to effectively&#13;
carry out this task. Also, it has no mandate to intervene in and coordinate the contracting of works and&#13;
services. Most entities have failed to establish procurement units and "Procurement Committees" staffed by&#13;
qualified professionals and supported by approved procedures or guidelines. Current procurement and&#13;
contracting policies and procedures are outdated, confusing and, frequently, misunderstood. This results in&#13;
uncertainty and ambiguity as to which regulations and procedures apply and whether they apply equally for&#13;
goods, works and services. Lack of understanding of the current procedures leads to inconsistency in the&#13;
interpretation of these procedures within and between Ministries and entities. The current financial&#13;
thresholds for decision-making at operational levels are quite low. This results in delays due to multi-&#13;
layered reviews and approvals. It also encourages contract fragmentation by Ministries and entities in order&#13;
to avoid competitive bidding and reviews by approving authorities. Many public entities lack expertise in&#13;
preparing bidding documents, developing accurate specifications, conducting bid evaluations and contract&#13;
negotiations. There is no central database of performance of different contractors and suppliers.&#13;
Consequently, in awarding contracts, due weightage is not given to their past performance or capacity to&#13;
take on new projects. There are serious shortcomings in contract management as a result of which a large&#13;
number of projects face cost-overruns and execution delays, inviting public criticism. Finally, inventory&#13;
storage and management suffer from major deficiencies. As a result of these factors government does not&#13;
get the best value for the huge expenditures incurred annually on procurement of goods and services and on&#13;
civil works.&#13;
20.    Weaknesses of systems and procedures in procurement and conrtracting are accentuated by&#13;
deficiencies in internal control systems. The internal audit function in different entities is, generally, weak.&#13;
Consequently, internal auditors are unable to flag errors, ommissions or malpractices in an effective and&#13;
timely manner. The weakness of internal control systems leads to low accountability and, in some&#13;
instances, corruption. External auditing is the constitutional responsibility of the Auditor General.&#13;
However, even though various entities are progressively moving towards computerized accounts, the office&#13;
of the Auditor General lacks the expertise to audit such accounts.&#13;
GOJ's Policy for Public Sector Modernization&#13;
21.    The government recognizes that the continuing weaknesses of the public sector will offset the&#13;
benefits of the economic reforms that the country has implemented in recent years. Also, public sector&#13;
inefficiencies will hinder the development of the private sector. For it to play an effective role in the&#13;
new environment, the nature and orientation of the public sector needs to change significantly. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Modernization Projecr:: SAR: 7/96                                   9&#13;
needs to focus on its core competencies and become more performance-oriented, cost-effective and&#13;
accountable.&#13;
22.   The essential elements of GOJ's policy for public sector modernization are: (a) improving the&#13;
quality of service provided by essential government agencies to internal and external clients; (b)&#13;
enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of central government Ministries; (c) rationalizing the size&#13;
and scope of the public sector by privatizing entities and contracting out services that can be run more&#13;
efficiently by the private sector; (d) enhancing transparency and accountability in government&#13;
procurement, contracting and financial management; (e) creating an effective regulatory environment&#13;
that would encourage orderly private sector development; (f) improving tax administration; and (g)&#13;
strengthening local government. The Letter of Development Policy, dated February 23, 1996, (Annex&#13;
7) explains GOJ's development objectives.&#13;
Previous and Ongoing Initiatives to Modernize the Public Sector&#13;
23.   Efforts to reform the public sector have gone in parallel with the economic reform program.&#13;
Privatization was initiated in Jamaica in 1981 with a view to (i) increase efficiency of enterprises&#13;
through change of ownership; (ii) eliminate the fiscal drain caused by poorly performing public&#13;
enterprises; (iii) optimize the use of GOJ's limited management resources; (iv) create opportunities to&#13;
access foreign capital, technology and markets; and (v) widen the base of ownership and equity&#13;
participation in the economy. The process was intensified in 1991, when 64 entities were identified for&#13;
privatization. Out of these 47 entities covering a wide spectrum of sectors, such as hotels, banks,&#13;
sugar mills, airlines and telecommunications, have been divested. Government is in the process of&#13;
privatizing the power company and the railway. The Bank-financed Private Sector Development&#13;
Adjustment Loan (PSDAL) has had a major impact on the privatization program. The program is now&#13;
entering a new phase with the objective of expanding the role of the private sector in infrastructure as&#13;
well as transferring to it operational responsibilities in selected public administration and social areas.&#13;
In April 1995, GOJ approved a new list of 26 entities/activities slated for privatization. Another&#13;
indicative list of 26 public facilities/services that are candidates for privatization or contracting out has&#13;
also been drawn up. In view of the severe deficiencies experienced in the performance of public&#13;
enterprises engaged in water supply and sewerage, GOJ has also initiated steps aimed at bringing in&#13;
private participation in this sector.&#13;
24.   In order to improve management and performance of government entities, the Public&#13;
Administration Reform Project (PARP) was undertaken with Bank assistance between 1984-88. It&#13;
aimed at strengthening human and financial resource management in government and restructuring the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. This project was largely unsuccessful in creating sustained improvements, mainly&#13;
on account of the change in the government's and the Bank's commitment to the direction of the&#13;
initiatives undertaken. It was followed by the on-going Financial and Program Management&#13;
Improvement Project (FPMIP), which became effective in 1991. The project's objectives include&#13;
strengthening planning and budgeting throughout government; improving personnel policies; and&#13;
implementing a Financial Management Information System (FMIS) and a Human Resource&#13;
Management Information System (HRMIS). Considerable progress has been made under this project.&#13;
All Ministries and departments have begun preparing annual Corporate Plans and Program Budgets;&#13;
the accounting system has been adapted to program budgeting; and the financial reporting system has&#13;
been rationalized. The FMIS has been commissioned in all but three Ministries. The pilot modules of&#13;
the HRMIS have been installed at 16 sites. A strong relationship between corporate planning and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

program budgeting is, however, yet to be established. Also, further work needs to be done to enhance&#13;
the FMIS and the HRMIS and extend their coverage. Additional funds are needed for this purpose. In&#13;
1994, a comprehensive reform of tax departments was initiated through the Tax Administration Reform&#13;
Project (TAXARP). This project aims to broaden the tax base; facilitate voluntary compliance; and&#13;
improve the effectiveness of the tax administration in assessment and collection of taxes and control of&#13;
tax evasion. One major consultancy, which has laid the ground work for reorganization of the tax&#13;
departments on functional lines, has been completed. Work on development of a unique taxpayer&#13;
identification number is at an advanced stage and the development of an integrated tax administration&#13;
computer system is expected to begin shortly. In the context of the PSDAL, significant improvements&#13;
in import and export clearance procedures of the Customs Department have been achieved, although&#13;
much remains to be done in the area of organization and management of the department and&#13;
computerization of its operations.&#13;
25.    GOJ has also taken various other steps, outside the framework of donor-supported projects, to&#13;
streamline Ministries, achieve greater coherence in policy formulation, improve inter-agency&#13;
coordination and enhance quality of service rendered by public entities. These steps include&#13;
restructuring of Ministries in January 1995; creation of the post of Cabinet Secretary, as Head of the&#13;
Civil Service, to improve the quality of advice available to the Prime Minister and Cabinet;&#13;
establishment of the Efficiency and Reform Directorate to strengthen management, especially personnel&#13;
management, in government agencies; and revival of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on&#13;
Administrative Reforms (IMCAR) and the Permanent Secretaries' Board to improve coordination&#13;
between government agencies. In December 1994, a Citizen's Charter was laid before Parliament&#13;
emphasizing the obligation of public entities to improve the quality of service provided by them to the&#13;
people. Twelve entities having extensive dealings with the public were selected as pilot agencies for&#13;
customer service improvement. The progress made by these agencies is regularly monitored by the&#13;
Cabinet Secretariat. Finally, in an effort to improve the quality of top management in government&#13;
agencies, twenty-three well-qualified persons were recently selected from the public as well as private&#13;
sectors for appointment to senior management positions in the public service, including those of&#13;
Permanent Secretary.&#13;
PROJECT CONCEPT AND COMPOSITION&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
26.    The project aims to support GOJ's efforts to (i) bring about major improvements in the quality&#13;
of service provided by selected public agencies; (ii) improve the ability of selected Ministries to (a)&#13;
formulate sound sector policies, technical standards and operational norms, (b) effectively monitor and&#13;
evaluate downstream agencies to ensure that desired policy objectives are achieved, and (c) efficiently&#13;
perform corporate management functions; (iii) continue the rationalization of the public sector through&#13;
(a) private participation in the water supply and sewerage sector and (b) privatization or contracting out&#13;
of other facilities or services where government has no comparative advantage; (iv) improve efficiency,&#13;
value for money and transparency in government procurement and contracting; (v) enhance public&#13;
sector accountability by strengthening internal and external controls; (vi) improve the quality of&#13;
financial and personnel management in the public sector through computerized information systems and&#13;
(vii) prepare the next stage of the modernization process to (a) extend the reforms initiated by the&#13;
project in the pilot agencies and Ministries to the rest of the public sector and (b) introduce other&#13;
systemic improvements in public sector management. Regulatory reform is proposed to be addressed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Jamaica Public Sector Modernization Project:: SAR: 7/96                                   1 1&#13;
through two other IBRD initiatives: the Regulatory Reform and Private Investment Finance Facility and&#13;
the Financial Sector Review. Support to the local government reform effort is proposed to be provided&#13;
by the Parish Infrastructure Project that is was appraised in May 1996. Complementary efforts to&#13;
strengthen the Ministry of Local Government and Works at the central level are included in the present&#13;
project.&#13;
Eroject Conceg&#13;
27.   The project concept went through significant changes as the project evolved. Initially, it was&#13;
proposed to undertake a comprehensive reform of the public service grading and salary structure, with&#13;
a view to improve compensation levels vis-a-vis market comparators and enable GOJ to attract and&#13;
retain qualified persons. This idea was given up, subsequently, as an across-the-board salary increase&#13;
for all public servants implied a significant recurrent cost (estimated at about US$ 30 million per&#13;
annum for upgrading salaries of posts, with salary mid-point equal to or greater than US$ 2,000, to&#13;
80% of market comparators) without any guarantee that it would lead to an improvement in public&#13;
sector performance. Also, it was noted that low salaries were not the only cause of poor public sector&#13;
performance. Inadequate autonomy, lack of accountability, outmoded business processes and&#13;
insufficient physical resources also affected efficiency and effectiveness of public entities. In addition,&#13;
systemic weaknesses pertaining to procurement, contracting, internal and external control had a public&#13;
sector-wide negative impact on performance.&#13;
28.   It was, therefore, decided to adopt a more targeted approach that would create a tighter link&#13;
between inputs, outputs and outcomes. The public sector modernization process was seen to have two&#13;
major thrusts. First, entity-specific reforms that would modernize the functioning of individual&#13;
government institutions. Second, systemic reforms that would bring about improvements in public&#13;
sector performance as a whole. The project has been designed around these two parallel approaches.&#13;
29.    Limitations in absorptive capacity dictated that instead of attempting to modernize the public&#13;
sector at one go, it would be better to break up the modernization process into two stages. In Stage I,&#13;
a small number of high priority entities would be taken up for modernization, on a pilot basis. In&#13;
addition, systemic reforms in three important areas viz. privatization; strengthening of government&#13;
procurement, contracting, internal control and auditing; and extension and refinement of financial and&#13;
human resource management systems would be pursued. In Stage II, entity-specific reforms would be&#13;
extended to the remaining public sector entities, besides undertaking additional systemic reforms as&#13;
needed. This approach would allow adaptation of the modernization strategy to the Jamaican reality;&#13;
reduce risk associated with innovation and facilitate the extension of the reform process through the&#13;
demonstration effect. The present project will finance execution of activities related to Stage I of the&#13;
modernization process and the preparation of Stage II.&#13;
30.   The modernization strategy for the operational agencies and Ministries has been developed in&#13;
close consultation with the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance and Planning, the&#13;
OSC, the Solicitor General and the Ministry of Enviromnent and Housing, the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government and Works, and the management and staff of the pilot operational agencies. Various&#13;
senior management retreats and seminars for public servants have been organized to build a wide&#13;
support base for the reform. Valuable support was also received from the UK Overseas Development&#13;
Agency (ODA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Public Sector Modernization: Stage I&#13;
(A)   Modernization of Public Sector Entities: Executive Agencies and Ministries&#13;
31.   In Stage 1, public entities at two levels will be targeted: (a) agencies providing services to&#13;
internal and external clients, which would be converted into "Executive Agencies", and (b) central&#13;
divisions of government Ministries that are engaged in policy formulation, monitoring, coordination&#13;
and corporate management. The modernization process would aim to empower managers of these&#13;
entities by granting them considerably enhanced autonomy in managerial, financial, personnel and&#13;
operational management, in return for strict accountability for pre-determined performance targets.&#13;
This approach draws upon the experience of other Commonwealth countries, especially the UK, who&#13;
have, in the recent past, attempted fundamental changes in public sector management on these lines.&#13;
Side by side with reorienting the management of the pilot agencies, well-defined institution building&#13;
investments would be made to ensure that the current resource gaps do not continue to hamper&#13;
performance.&#13;
32.    Legal Framework: The legal framework governing financial and personnel management in&#13;
GOJ was examined to determine the feasibility of granting increased autonomy to public entities&#13;
(Annex 9). It was found that, but for a few minor amendments needed in specific Acts pertaining to&#13;
some of the targeted agencies, the Constitution, the Financial Administration and Audit Act and the&#13;
Civil Service Establishment Act have enough flexibility to enable the government to grant additional&#13;
autonomy to executive agencies through administrative orders. It is proposed to use this flexibility to&#13;
create the pilot executive agencies. Be that as it may, it is recognized that in the long-term it would be&#13;
preferable to design and enact a self-contained legal framework specifically for executive agencies that&#13;
would put the autonomy granted to them on a firmer footing and reduce the risk of it being withdrawn&#13;
in the future through administrative fiat. The development of such a legal framework would..........&#13;
however, require observation of the experience of the pilot agencies and building of a wide political&#13;
and administrative consensus. This process will be supported by the project. In the meantime,&#13;
suitable remedies have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement to guard against unwarranted&#13;
withdrawal of autonomy granted to the entities covered by the project.&#13;
(a) Executive Agencies&#13;
33.    GOJ has selected the following pilot entities for conversion into executive agencies. These&#13;
were chosen on account of the important services they perform for the public or for other&#13;
governmental institutions, and the urgent need to improve the quality of their services. "Entities&#13;
marked (*) are also amongst the agencies selected as pilots to implement the Citizen's Charter, referred&#13;
to earlier.&#13;
*  Planning Institute of Jamaica (Ministry of Finance and Planning).&#13;
*  Jamaica Customs Department* (Ministry of Finance and Planning).&#13;
*  Office of Titles* (Ministry of Environment and Housing).&#13;
*  Town Planning Department* (Ministry of Environment and Housing).&#13;
*  Surveys Department (Ministry of Environment and Housing).&#13;
*  Jamaica Information Service (Office of the Prime Minister).&#13;
I JAMPRESS (Office of the Prime Minister).&#13;
*  Registrar General's Department* (Ministry of Health).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Modernization Prolect:: SAR: 7/96                                  13&#13;
*  Registrar of Companies* (Ministry of Industry, Investment and Commerce).&#13;
*  Administrator General (Ministry of National Security and Justice).&#13;
*  Management Institute for National Development (Efficiency and Reform Directorate, Office of&#13;
the Prime Minister).&#13;
At Appraisal, provision had been made for the selection of two additional entities for&#13;
conversion to executive agencies in the course of project implementation. During negotiations,&#13;
it was indicated by GOJ that it had identified Jamaica Promotions Corporation - JAMPRO&#13;
(Ministry of Industry, Information and Commerce) and the Construction Division (Ministry of&#13;
Local Government and Works) for this purpose.&#13;
34.   The British Overseas Development Agency (ODA) will provide parallel financing of UK&#13;
Pounds 2.0 million (about US$ 3.0 million) to finance consulting services for four of the above-&#13;
mentioned agencies, namely Registrar General's Department; Registrar of Companies; Administrator&#13;
General; and Management Institute for National Development. Goods and training for these agencies&#13;
will, however, be financed by the Bank and GOJ. The European Union (EU) is also expected to&#13;
provide parallel grant financing of about US$ 3 million for the Planning Institute of Jamaica and the&#13;
Construction Division of the Ministry of Local Government and Works. Details of the grant are&#13;
expected to be finalized by the EU and GOJ by December 31, 1996. For the present, expected EU&#13;
financing is included in GOJ's counterpart contribution. Background information, main functions and&#13;
activities, employment composition, current financial arrangements, and prevailing constraints and&#13;
weaknesses of the first set of eleven agencies listed above are indicated in Annex 2.&#13;
35.    For each of the pilot agencies, the modernization strategy will consist of the following steps.&#13;
First, GOJ will select/confirm the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Agency and the core&#13;
management team of the entity. In most cases, the selection would be done on a competitive basis&#13;
considering both public sector and private sector candidates. However, in exceptional cases, where the&#13;
Head of an agency or a member of its core management has been recently appointed through a&#13;
competitive process, or where the performance of the incumbent is extremely strong, a fresh selection&#13;
process may be dispensed with.&#13;
36.    Once the top management team of the agency is in place, consultants with the requisite&#13;
organizational, management, legal and technical skills will be engaged. Working closely with the CEO&#13;
and the core management team they will prepare three main documents that will inform the&#13;
modernization process for the agency. These are:&#13;
a) Modernization Plan&#13;
b) Medium-Term Financing Plan&#13;
c) Framework Document&#13;
37.   The Modernization Plan will be based on a detailed review of organization, management,&#13;
business processes and resources of the agency. It will provide, inter alia, the following:&#13;
Identification of actions to be taken to implement the new management strategy based on&#13;
increased delegation of authority and strict accountability for achievement of specific&#13;
performance requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Modernization Project:: SAR: 7/96                                          14&#13;
Recommendations for changes in agency-specific laws, regulations and norms, if required.&#13;
These will include recommendations for amendments in laws and regulations to enable the&#13;
agency to charge or revise fees for services provided to clients.&#13;
Design ot re-engineered business processes to enhance effectiveness and productivity.&#13;
Design of the new organizational structure to support the re-engineered business processes.&#13;
Recommendations for developing client service orientation.&#13;
Job descriptions and skill requirements at all levels of the new organizational structure.&#13;
Design of career paths.&#13;
Design of an effective performance appraisal system, including performance indicators for&#13;
each position.&#13;
Salary grades for each position to ensure ability to attract and retain the required skills.&#13;
Design of a performance-linked incentive system.&#13;
Rightsizing strategy, including design of severance package and support to employees&#13;
declared redundant.&#13;
Design otf internal control system to ensure transparency and accountability.&#13;
Identification of changes needed in Financial Management Information System (FMIS) and&#13;
Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS), being developed separately,&#13;
to adapt them to the agency.&#13;
Requirements definition for other management information systems needed.&#13;
Requirements definition for information systems needed to automate agency operations.&#13;
Assessment of other physical resource needs for effective functioning of the agency,&#13;
including operational equipment, transportation, communication facilities, storage&#13;
facilities, office space and oftice refurbishing.&#13;
The Modernization Plan will provide a fully costed, time-bound implementation plan for the&#13;
agency.&#13;
38.    The Medium-Term Financing Plan will indicate the financing needs of the agency for a 5 year&#13;
period. In order to develop a motivating remuneration structure for the staff, it is proposed to follow&#13;
an, essentially, self-financing strategy. A resource pool receiving contributions from three sources&#13;
will be created in each agency. First, business process redesign, automation of routine processes and&#13;
matching of the agency's outputs with employee skills will be used to rightsize the staff complement.&#13;
In some of the agencies this process is expected to generate net savings over the current level of salary&#13;
and wages, after taking into account severance costs. These savings will contribute to the resource&#13;
pool. Second, some of the agencies are legally authorized to charge fees from their clients. For the&#13;
others, it may be possible to design user fees. It is proposed to allow the agencies to retain a part of&#13;
their fee revenues, based on their overall performance. Retained fees will be the second source of&#13;
funds for the resource pool. Where current fee levels do not reflect the actual cost of service provided,&#13;
these would be revised. Also buoyancy will be built into them so that they can keep pace with&#13;
inflation. At the same time, to prevent agencies from charging monopolistic fees, the fees will be&#13;
established or revised in consultation with the Ministry of Finance which will ensure that a fair and&#13;
uniform approach is adopted. Finally, efficiency gains reflected in savings made by the agencies in&#13;
their operational expenses, through improved productivity or thrift, will be allowed to be retained and&#13;
will add to the resource pool. At the end of each year, based on an objective performance evaluation&#13;
of each staff member, the CEO will award incentives which will supplement staff salaries. This&#13;
approach would closely align institutional objectives with individual interests and promote rightsizing,&#13;
productivity and cost-consciousness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector-Modern,zation Prolect:: .SIIR. 7/96                                15&#13;
39.    However, since the resource pool will be filled only over time, at the beginning of the&#13;
modernization process, GOJ will need to provide adequate salaries for the CEO and the core&#13;
management team so as to have a high quality management team leading the turn-around of each&#13;
agency. Also, even after all the funds in the resource pool are accounted for, in some agencies, there&#13;
may not be enough to raise the effective remuneration of employees to the requisite level. In such&#13;
cases GOJ will have to consider financing salary increases through the regular budget.&#13;
40.   Taking the above factors into account, the Medium-Term Financing Plan will indicate the&#13;
following:&#13;
Capital and revenue expenditures to be financed, including investments to improve the&#13;
agency's physical resources, salary enhancements for key and critical positions, severance&#13;
costs and performance-linked incentives to be paid to management and staff.&#13;
GOJ budgetary support to the agency.&#13;
Amount of own revenues (user fees etc.) and savings from efficiency gains to be retained&#13;
by the agency for its own use.&#13;
*  Resources to be provided by the Public Sector Modernization Project (PSMP).&#13;
*  Resources to be provided by the ODA and other donors, where applicable.&#13;
41.   The Framework Document will be based on the Modernization Plan and the Medium-Term&#13;
Financing Plan and would, inter alia:&#13;
Define the mission and objectives of the agency.&#13;
Establish the rights and obligations of the management and GOJ, respectively, with regard&#13;
to the functioning of the agency. These would include:&#13;
* Specific outputs to be delivered by the management.&#13;
* Resources that would be available to management to achieve the required outputs&#13;
(as detailed in the medium term financing plan) along with MOFP assurance&#13;
regarding predictability of cash flows.&#13;
* Extent and nature of managerial, operational, financial and personnel management&#13;
autonomy that would be granted to the management.&#13;
* Performance indicators and the methods of performance measurement and&#13;
evaluation to be used.&#13;
* Rewards and sanctions that would follow performance evaluation.&#13;
42.   The Framework Document will constitute the basic contract between the government and the&#13;
management of the entity. It will be duly signed by the Permanent Secretary of the relevant Ministry,&#13;
on behalf of GOJ, and the CEO of the executive agency.&#13;
43.   Disbursement Condition: Disbursements under the project for the preparation of the&#13;
Modernization Plan, Medium-Term Financing Plan and the Framework Document will be made subject&#13;
to the appointment of a CEO, with qualifications acceptable to the Bank. Disbursements for the&#13;
implementation of the Modernization Plan for a particular agency would be subject to (a) the&#13;
preparation of the Modernization Plan, Medium-Term Financing Plan and the Framework Document,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank; (b) signing of the Framework Document by GOJ and the concerned CEO and&#13;
(c) a legal framework, satisfactory to the Bank, being in full force and effect to enable the agency to&#13;
carry out its Modernization Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Alodernizarion Project. £4R: 7'96                                     16&#13;
44.    After the execution of the Framework Document, the implementation of the Modernization&#13;
Plan will begin. This will involve the following main activities:&#13;
Make administrative changes to grant increased autonomy and enhance accountability.&#13;
Make changes in FMIS, if needed, and implement it in agency along with other internal&#13;
controls.&#13;
Implement new organizational structure.&#13;
Refurbish offices.&#13;
Match skills of current staff with required skills.&#13;
Retrench redundant staff.&#13;
Recruit new staff with required skills.&#13;
Move staff to new organizational units and functions.&#13;
Establish customer service units.&#13;
Implement revised remuneration system, incentive system and career paths.&#13;
Implement new performance evaluation system.&#13;
Make changes in HRMIS, if needed, and implement it in agency.&#13;
Design, develop and implement other management information systems.&#13;
Design, develop and implement information systems to automate agency operations.&#13;
Prepare manuals of norms, procedures and regulations based on new structure,&#13;
management systems and business processes.&#13;
Train staff.&#13;
Implement re-engineered business processes.&#13;
Acquire operational equipment, transportation, communication facilities, storage facilities&#13;
etc.&#13;
Carry out civil works, where required.&#13;
* Monitor and evaluate developmental impact of modernization.&#13;
45.    To ensure that the investments being made in the targeted agencies produce tangible results,&#13;
the performance of these entities will be strictly monitored through regular annual reviews. Where it&#13;
exceeds agreed targets, suitable incentives and rewards will be granted to the management and the&#13;
staff. Where, on the other hand, performance is below expectations, appropriate sanctions, including&#13;
changes in top management, will be applied. In order to increase general awareness about the&#13;
expectations from these agencies and to ensure transparency of the evaluation process, the Framework&#13;
Document, performance targets and achievements of the agencies will be published. Preliminary&#13;
performance indicators, covering Service Quantity, Service Quality and Cost Effectiveness, for the first&#13;
set of eleven executive agencies have been developed and are indicated in Annex 3. These will be&#13;
further refined in the process of preparation of the Framework Document. Also, suitable benchmarks&#13;
will be established. Customer surveys will be relied upon, where appropriate, to measure outcomes&#13;
resulting from the activities of the targeted entities.&#13;
46.   In the six agencies for which the ODA or EU would have lead responsibility, some&#13;
modifications in approach may be made. However, the broad thrust of the activities will be similar.&#13;
Close coordination between GOJ, ODA, EU and the Bank will be maintained throughout.&#13;
&#13;

(b) Ministries&#13;
47.   Three Ministries will be taken up for modernization in Stage 1. Two of these, the Ministry of&#13;
Local Government and Works (MLGW) and the Ministry of Environment and Housing (MEH), have&#13;
already been identified, the third will be identified during project implementation. The MLGW has&#13;
been formed recently by amalgamating the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government and is in need of signiticant restructuring to integrate its two components. Further, the&#13;
Ministry is responsible for managing huge capital expenditures and improvements in its management&#13;
would have a significant impact on overall GOJ spending. Also, central level reforms at the MLGW&#13;
will complement institutional reforms at the local government level that are proposed to be undertaken&#13;
under the Parish Infrastructure Project. The MEH is also high on the GOJ's priorities. Three out of&#13;
the eleven line entities targeted tor conversion to executive agencies viz. the Office of Titles; the&#13;
Surveys Department, and the Town Planning Department fall within the purview of this Ministry.&#13;
There would be considerable synergy in undertaking simultaneous reform at the central level in this&#13;
Ministry and at the line agency level in the three agencies affiliated to it. Background information,&#13;
main functions and activities, employment composition, current financial arrangements, and prevailing&#13;
constraints and weaknesses of the identified Ministries are indicated in Annex 2.&#13;
48.    The modernization plan for the Ministries would involve the strengthening of their central&#13;
divisions that are engaged in policy formulation, monitoring of policy implementation and corporate&#13;
functions. The project would aim to improve the access of the Ministries to high quality information on&#13;
which to base policy tormulation; assist in the development of sound sector policies, technical&#13;
standards, and operating norms and guidelines; develop effective monitoring and evaluation systems;&#13;
strengthen budgeting, planning, accounting, procurement, contracting, internal control and personnel&#13;
management functions; and provide training to staff in related areas. Since the focus of the project&#13;
would be on the central divisions of the Ministries, operational agencies affiliated to these Ministries,&#13;
other than those included in the list of executive agencies indicated above, will not be covered in Stage&#13;
1. These would be taken up in Stage 11.&#13;
49.    The process of modernization of Ministries would follow a course similar to that in the case of&#13;
executive agencies. A Modernization Plan; a Medium Term Financing Plan and a Framework&#13;
Document, on the same pattern as for executive agencies, would be prepared for each Ministry. The&#13;
Framework Document in the case of a Ministry will, however, be signed by the Minister, on behalf of&#13;
the government, and by the Permanent Secretary, as the CEO of the Ministry.&#13;
50.    Disbursement Condition: A disbursement condition similar to that for executive agencies&#13;
would also apply to each targeted Ministry. Disbursements under the project for the preparation of the&#13;
Modernization Plan, Medium-Term Financing Plan and the Framework Document will be made subject&#13;
to the appointment of a Permanent Secretary. Disbursements for the implementation of the&#13;
Modernization Plan for a particular Ministry would be subject to (a) the preparation of the&#13;
Modernization Plan, Medium-Term Financing Plan and the Framework Document, satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank; (b) signing of the Framework Document by GOJ and the concerned Permanent Secretary and (c)&#13;
a legal framework, satisfactory to the Bank, being in full force and effect to enable the Ministry to&#13;
carry out its Modernization Plan.&#13;
51.    As part of the review of each Ministry, its mission, role and functions will be examined and&#13;
suitable changes, if needed, will be recommended. However, in keeping with current best practice, it&#13;
&#13;

is not proposed to burden this project with policy conditionalities. Project assistance will address the&#13;
intrinsic organizational and management deficiencies of the Ministries, so as to equip them to perform&#13;
effectively in any policy environment. Nevertheless, the importance of sound sector policies cannot be&#13;
minimized. As such, dialogue to improve and strengthen the policy orientation of the selected&#13;
Ministries will continue on a parallel track.&#13;
52.    Crtical Success Factors: The granting of enhanced autonomy subject to strict accountability&#13;
for performance is a relatively new concept in Jamaica and marks a significant departure from&#13;
traditional public service management practices. Its success will depend on strong and continued&#13;
commitment, at both the political and the administrative levels. Also, especially in the early period,&#13;
the evolution of the executive agencies will have to be watched closely and suitable refinements in&#13;
strategy, legal and administrative framework and management practices will need to be made in a&#13;
timely manner. The Ministry of Finance will have a special role to play, because only if it allows real&#13;
financial autonomy to the executive agencies will the latter be able to perform at the expected level.&#13;
This would include ensuring that, barring extraordinary circumstances, the cash flows agreed to under&#13;
the Medium-Term Financing Plan of each agency are made available to them. Also the Ministry will&#13;
have to increase its oversight over expenditures to ensure that the autonomy is not misused. This&#13;
underlines the importance of strengthening internal auditing and extending the FMIS to the selected&#13;
agencies on priority. The support of the Efficiency and Reform Directorate (ERD) and the OSC will&#13;
also be crucial in adjusting personnel management practices in the agencies. Finally, it will be&#13;
important to secure the full involvement and commitment of the employees of the pilot entities and the&#13;
support of public service unions.&#13;
53.    The commitment of the present government to the objective of creating responsive and efficient&#13;
public entities is very high. The initiative is supported at the highest level of government. A copy of&#13;
the Cabinet Secretary's letter dated March 5, 1996 regarding the granting of autonomy to the targeted&#13;
agencies is placed in Annex 8. An extensive public relations campaign has been conducted as part of&#13;
project preparation to build public support for the initiative. So far, the response of the labor unions&#13;
and the opposition parties has been, generally, positive. It is expected that once the benefits of the&#13;
approach are demonstrated by some early successes, political support would be strengthened further.&#13;
At the top administrative level also, commitment is quite strong. Nevertheless, as the project aims to&#13;
significantly alter the way business has been conducted in the government in the past, some resistance&#13;
to change can be anticipated. To some extent, this will decrease as the reform efforts become more&#13;
concrete and comprehensible. Also, a continuing communication campaign would be carried out to&#13;
allay unjustitied fears and build ownership. Assistance to be provided by the project to strengthen&#13;
internal and external auditing and to streamline procurement and contracting practices (discussed&#13;
below) should help increase the Ministry of Finance's level of comfort with enhanced autonomy at the&#13;
entity level. The response of the ERD and OSC to the proposed changes has been very positive and&#13;
their support is expected to continue.&#13;
(B)    Privatization&#13;
54.    In order for the public sector to improve its performance, it is essential for it to withdraw from&#13;
those commercial and productive activities in which it has no comparative advantage. By doing so, it&#13;
would be able to focus on its core competencies and avoid the fiscal drain caused by inefficiently run,&#13;
loss-making public enterprises. Also, the consequential reduction in the size of the public service&#13;
would enable the government to begin paying motivating wages to the remaining employees. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Modernization Proqecv: SAR: 7/96                                    19&#13;
would facilitate the induction of high quality individuals into the public service and contribute towards&#13;
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public institutions. Privatization of public entities and&#13;
contracting out of services of a commercial nature are the principal tools through which an orderly&#13;
reduction in the size and scope of the public sector is proposed to be achieved. It is also a means to&#13;
encourage private investments in the productive sectors and infrastructure that are critical to the&#13;
development of the country, but cannot be afforded by the government.&#13;
55.    GOJ is of the view that the National Investment Bank of Jamaica (NIBJ), the main&#13;
implementing and coordinating agency for the privatization program, is adequately geared to handle the&#13;
privatization of the entities that remain out of the list of 1991 and those that were approved for&#13;
divestiture by the Cabinet in 1995. However, assistance under the Project is required in the three&#13;
areas mentioned below:&#13;
* Privatization of the Water and Sewerage Sector;&#13;
* Privatization or contracting out of an additional set of facilities and services;&#13;
* Institutional strengthening of NIBJ.&#13;
(i) Privatization of Water and Sewerage Sector&#13;
56.    The project will assist GOJ in developing and implementing an appropriate privatization&#13;
strategy for the water and sewerage sector that would ensure economic allocation of water between&#13;
competing uses, while improving the quality of service provided to the public.&#13;
57.   Institutonal Arrangements: Although the control of the water and sewerage sector in Jamaica&#13;
is widely dispersed between several institutions, the production, treatment and supply of water are&#13;
dominated by the National Water Commission (NWC) and the National Irrigation Commission (NIC),&#13;
who have responsibility for production and distribution of domestic and irrigation water, respectively.&#13;
These agencies are also the major competitors for water in the island. Several other GOJ agencies&#13;
such as the Ministry of Local Government and Works, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC)&#13;
and a number of limited liability companies are also involved in water supply or sewerage projects in&#13;
various locations throughout the country. The Underground Water Authority (UWA), established&#13;
under the Underground Water Authority Control Act, 1959, has responsibility for data collection&#13;
relating to ground and surface water resources. UWA also develops island-wide master plans for&#13;
water resources utilization and both the NWC and NIC need to apply to it for permits for the quantity&#13;
of water they plan to extract from the ground. The regulatory role of the UWA has recently been&#13;
strengthened by the Water Resources Act of 1995 that will transform the UWA into the Water&#13;
Resources Authority (WRA). The WRA will manage all the nation's water resources by evaluating&#13;
and controlling the allocation of both ground water as well as surface water. It will also rationalize&#13;
planning and development activities in the water sector within the framework of the existing Water&#13;
Resources Development Master Plan developed with the assistance of the UNDP.&#13;
58.   The NWC was established as a statutory body in 1980 by combining the National Water&#13;
Authority and the Kingston and St. Andrew Water Commission. NWC is the sole water and sewerage&#13;
authority, providing water services to about 75% of the population and operating about 30% of the&#13;
sewerage treatment capacity in the island. Areas not directly served by NWC are served by smaller&#13;
parish systems, or in some cases by independent entities. The total production capacity of NWC is&#13;
700,000 cubic meters per day. Of this production, unaccounted for water amounts to over 50%. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public SectorModernization Project:: SAR: 7/96                                      20&#13;
includes losses due to leaking mains, unrecorded and unbilled consumption as a result of defective&#13;
meters and unregistered consumption. The NWC has a poor operating record and has been able to&#13;
continue operations only as a result of large capital injections by the government. The Jamaica Water&#13;
Supply and Sewerage TA Loan (1984-94) provided technical assistance to NWC management, besides&#13;
emergency supplies and equipment. Although water accounts doubled, sustainable improvements in&#13;
management were not achieved. In mid-1995, as an interim measure, GOJ made major managerial and&#13;
financial changes that included (i) a new Board and senior management; (ii) recruitment of five senior&#13;
technical experts with EU assistance and (iii) transfer of the main elements of debt service to the&#13;
government.&#13;
59.    The NIC was established in 1987 with the mandate to operate and maintain the public&#13;
irrigation system in the island. Its systems are located in areas that have insufficient rainfall and are&#13;
completely independent from the NWC's potable water systems. Generally, the water supplied by the&#13;
NIC is untreated.&#13;
60.    The rates for water and sewerage are currently set by the Ministry of Public Utilities and&#13;
Transport (MPUT). However, all regulatory authority in this respect will be transferred to the Office&#13;
of Utility Regulation (OUR), once this office is fully established.&#13;
61.    Supply and Demand: Present domestic and industrial water usage in Jamaica is about 223&#13;
million cubic meters per year and irrigation usage is about 682 million cubic meters per year. The&#13;
projected demand in the year 2015 for domestic water is about 346 million cubic meters per year and&#13;
for irrigation about 1338 million cubic meters per year. In order to meet the projected demand, an&#13;
estimated investment of about US$ I billion will be required in the water and sewerage sector. Since&#13;
the public sector would not have the requisite resources, GOJ plans to encourage private participation&#13;
in this sector.&#13;
62.    Project Assistance: In the past, numerous studies have been carried out to identify different&#13;
privatization options for the NWC. These have, however, been carried out as isolated efforts and have&#13;
focused only on the NWC's need to meet the demand for potable water. As Phase I of the water sector&#13;
privatization, a brief consultancy to review and expand on the previous studies, with a view to develop&#13;
a comprehensive strategy that takes into account water requirements for domestic use and irrigation has&#13;
already been initiated and will be financed retroactively by the Project. It will examine the availability&#13;
of water for all areas of the island, particularly the Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA), and make&#13;
recommendations to resolve any short to medium-term conflicts in the use of water. It will also&#13;
examine the current institutional arrangements and recommend the broad structure and ownership of&#13;
the various entities comprising the sector. The study will review the experience of other countries that&#13;
have involved the private sector in the production and delivery of potable water, irrigation water and&#13;
provision of sewerage services. It will consider the extent of vertical and horizontal integration, the&#13;
extent and nature of existing and potential competition in the sector and types of privatization&#13;
arrangements, such as management contract, affermage/service contract, lease, concessions or&#13;
privatization of assets, that have been adopted in other countries. The study will identify the&#13;
privatization options available to GOJ and their policy implications. A draft report of the study is&#13;
being currently reviewed by GOJ. This study will be followed by a more detailed study, also to be&#13;
financed by the project, that will address the institutional, regulatory, legal and financial implications&#13;
of the recommended policy. Based on the results of these studies, GOJ is expected to take a decision,&#13;
by March 31, 1997, on the particular course to be adopted. Thereafter, the project will assist it in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Modernization Project:: SAR: 7/96                                     21&#13;
implementing the next phase of the privatization process by financing the engagement of the required&#13;
financial, regulatory, legal, accounting and technical experts.&#13;
63.    The support provided by the PSMP to the privatization of the water and sewerage sector will&#13;
be complemented by the proposed Jamaica Water Supply and Sewerage Privatization Preparation&#13;
Project which aims to: (i) rehabilitate the water production and waste water facilities of the NWC in&#13;
the Kingston Metropolitan Area; (ii) install valves, zone meters and consumer meters; (iii) undertake&#13;
leak repairs; and (iv) conduct consumer surveys. These inputs are considered necessary to make the&#13;
sector attractive for private investment or management.&#13;
(ii) Privatization/Contracting Out of Facilities and Services&#13;
64.    GOJ has prepared an indicative list (Annex 4) of entities and services for privatization or&#13;
contracting out. These include National Stadium Complex, Hope Garden and Zoo, Maxfield Park&#13;
Children's Home, Minard Great House, Food Stamp Program, Statutory Legal Aid System, Prison&#13;
Health Services, Food Storage Infestation, etc.. In addition, the comprehensive review of the&#13;
remaining public entities proposed to be carried out as part of the preparation of Stage II of the public&#13;
sector modernization process, is expected to identify other entities that would be suitable candidates for&#13;
privatization or contracting out. The project will assist GOJ in the privatization or contracting out of&#13;
the selected entities. Not later than December 31 of each year of project implementation, starting in&#13;
1996, the entities/services to be privatized in the succeeding fiscal year will be agreed to by GOJ and&#13;
the Bank. The entities to be taken up for privatization in FY 1996-97 would, however, be included in&#13;
the Annual Action Plan for this year to be prepared as a condition of Loan Effectiveness. On the&#13;
whole, this sub-component would assist in the privatization of 30 to 35 entities or services.&#13;
(iii) Institutional strengthening of NIBJ&#13;
65.   In order to boost the ongoing privatization program as well as ensure the efficient execution of&#13;
privatizations proposed under this project, the institutional capacity of NIBJ will be strengthened. The&#13;
project will finance the hiring of a full-time qualified resident advisor, as required by and agreed with&#13;
NIBJ. The advisor would assist NIBJ management and staff in putting together and implementing&#13;
privatization transactions. Further, successful privatization will require NIBJ to conduct an effective&#13;
communication campaign that explains the costs of maintaining the status quo as well as the benefits of&#13;
privatization to various stake-holders, so as to build broad support for the program and allay&#13;
unwarranted fears. For this purpose, assistance will be provided to strengthen the public relations and&#13;
marketing capabilities of NIBJ. Finally, training to NIBJ staff would be provided in private sector&#13;
participation in infrastructure projects, economic regulation, privatization techniques, project and&#13;
capital financing, and project appraisal and management.&#13;
(C) Government Procurement, Contracting, Internal Control and Auditing&#13;
(i) Procurement and Contracting&#13;
66.    GOJ has recently decided to launch a broad-based reform in order to address the deficiencies in the&#13;
procurement and contracting processes discussed earlier. The project will support this initiative so as to&#13;
enhance value for money, transparency and accountability. It is proposed to provide project assistance at&#13;
three levels:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Modernizarion Project:: SAR: 7/96                                         22&#13;
67.    First, a Procurement Policy Implementation Unit will be established within the Inspectorate&#13;
Division of the Ministry of Finance. This unit will have responsibility for developing and updating&#13;
procurement standards and procedures. It will assist ministeries and departments in establishing the&#13;
procurement functions of Procurement/Contracting Units and Procurement Committees; provide guidance&#13;
in procurement matters; and monitor procurement operations of the individual entities. The unit will update&#13;
the procurement policy manual incorporating modern practices in this field. Further, it will act as a central&#13;
resource for advice on the procurement process, market conditions, stores management, and oversees&#13;
procurements. The project will finance the hiring of a long-term Procurement Adviser for three years as&#13;
well as short-term consultancies in specialized areas. In addition, it will finance training for the staff of the&#13;
unit, computer equipment, hooks and literature.&#13;
68.    Second, assistance will be provided to strengthen the office of the Contractor General (CG).&#13;
Recently, in order to provide a central authority for the award of contracts that would enhance general&#13;
confidence in the process, the government has proposed the amendment of the Contractor General's Act to&#13;
create an independent National Contracts Commission (NCC), chaired by the CG and assisted by a small&#13;
Secretariat comprised of qualified professionals. Proposals concerning the role of the NCC and the CG are&#13;
being reviewed by the Parliamentary Committe on Infrastructure and are expected to be discussed in&#13;
Parliament at a early date. In line with the final decisions taken in this regard, the project will assist in&#13;
strengthening the Office of the Contractor General, through establishment of the Secretariat. For this&#13;
purpose it will finance the required consulting services, training and equipment.&#13;
69.    Third, the Procurement/Contracting Units and Procurement Conunittees in different Ministries will&#13;
be strengthened through consulting services, training and equipment so that they can effectively implement&#13;
the applicable procurement and contracting guidelines. Training activities will focus on&#13;
procurement/contracting policies, regulations and procedures of GOJ and international financial institutions;&#13;
preparation of bidding documents and specifications, bid evaluation, contract negotiation, contract&#13;
administration, quality control and materials management.&#13;
(ii) Internal Control&#13;
70.    In order to strengthen internal controls throughout government (these are crucial for the&#13;
efficient delegation of financial authority in the context of the creation of executive agencies, as well)&#13;
GOJ proposes to set up an Internal Audit Directorate (IAD) within the Financial Management Division&#13;
of the Ministry of Finance. The IAD will establish uniform operating standards and systems for&#13;
conducting internal audits; set ethical norms; coordinate the training and professional development of&#13;
internal auditors; and conduct internal control reviews under the Financial Administration and Audit&#13;
Act. A new job classification for auditors is expected to be developed soon to emphasize the group as&#13;
a profession, establish high qualification criteria and improve their remuneration package. A new&#13;
curriculum for training public sector auditors is also proposed to be developed by MIND. The project&#13;
will support the establishment of the IAD through consulting services, training, equipment, books and&#13;
auditing literature.&#13;
(iii) External Auditing&#13;
71.    In order to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Auditor General in exercising effective&#13;
ex-post control, the project will provide consultants, training and equipment to enable the office to&#13;
enhance its auditing capabilities, especially in computer-aided auditing of automated accounts and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Modernization Pro;ect.: 94R: 7,96                                  23&#13;
exercising effective external control over procurement and contracting decisions. The latter function&#13;
has gained added importance in view of GOJ's proposal to give semi-executive functions to the&#13;
Contractor General.&#13;
(D)   FMIS and the HRMIS&#13;
72.   Two important activities covered under the IBRD financed Financial Program Management&#13;
Improvement Project (FPMIP), which became effective on 09/17/91, are the development and phased&#13;
implementation of the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) and the Human Resource&#13;
Management Information System (HRMIS). The FMIS is intended to computerize Budget&#13;
Formulation, Budget Execution, Accounting and Financial Reporting. Its objective is to enhance&#13;
accountability, transparency and efficiency in public financial management at the central level. The&#13;
HRMIS aims to fulfill information and automation needs in human resource management, especially in&#13;
areas of personnel administration, manpower planning, succession planning, employee development&#13;
and allocation of human resources.&#13;
73.    A preliminary review of the two systems was conducted during project preparation. In Phase&#13;
I of the FMIS, the Expenditure Authorization, Accounting and Check Printing modules have been&#13;
developed. These have been commissioned in nine of the twelve Ministries, covering 11 sites. Phase&#13;
II of the system, now under development, would cover Commitment Planning and Control,&#13;
Consolidation of Central Accounts and Management of Externally Funded Projects. Phase III of the&#13;
system would create an Executive Information System to allow reports in a flexible format to be&#13;
generated for senior management. Certain aspects of the system that require further strengthening&#13;
were identified during the review. These would be addressed during project implementation. In&#13;
addition, modules for Budget Formulation and Cash Management need to be developed and the&#13;
linkages of the FMIS with the tax administration, debt management and central bank computer systems&#13;
need to be established. A prototype of the HRMIS has been developed and installed at 16 sites. Core&#13;
personnel data regarding 36,000 employees has been entered. Additional educational and historical&#13;
data is yet to be entered. The next step would be to automate business functions related to personnel&#13;
management. A payroll module is proposed to be developed or procured. This will link the financial&#13;
data of the FMIS with personnel data of the HRMIS.&#13;
74.    GOJ is keen to implement these systems throughout the central government. However, since&#13;
the inception of the FPMIP the scope of the systems has been expanded considerably. Originally, the&#13;
FMIS was expected to be installed in 13 sites with 8-12 users per site. It is now proposed to be&#13;
installed at 42 sites with an average of 20 users per site. The HRMIS would be installed at 60-80&#13;
sites. Although, to some extent it would use the hardware used for the FMIS, separate servers and&#13;
PCs for the HRMIS would be needed for 5-10 additional workstations at each site for staff who deal&#13;
exclusively with personnel management. The FPMIP had provided for a total of US$ 6.235 million&#13;
for the development and implementation of both the FMIS and HRMIS. After allocation of unallocated&#13;
costs and some adjustment to other component costs the amount for computerization was raised to US$&#13;
7.0 million. But even this amount would be inadequate for the full implementation of the two systems.&#13;
Accordingly, it is proposed to provide additional funding of US$ 7.3 million, under the present&#13;
project, for further development and extension of the systems. Retroactive financing of US$ 600,000&#13;
would be provided to enable the purchase of urgently needed computer hardware.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Janaica Public Sector AModernizaunon Prolecr: . R: 7. 96                                    24&#13;
(E)    Communication Campaign&#13;
75.    Given the far-reaching impact of the project, an effective communication campaign would be&#13;
imperative to keep all stake-holders and the public informed of the objectives, activities and&#13;
accomplishments of the project. This would help in building and widening support for public sector&#13;
modernization. Accordingly, the project would support an extensive information campaign that would&#13;
be carried out throughout the duration of the project.&#13;
Development of Stage 11 of Public Sector Modemnization&#13;
76.    To prepare Stage 11 of the public sector modernization process, consultants will be engaged to&#13;
enable GOJ to systematically review all public entities, other than those covered in Stage 1, and decide&#13;
on entities that need to be closed down, privatized, converted into executive agencies or strengthened&#13;
in their present form. Also additional systemic reforms required will be identified. Based on this&#13;
analysis, and the experience of Stage 1, suitable strategies will be developed to extend the&#13;
modernization process to other Ministries and agencies. A detailed action plan to put these strategies&#13;
into effect will he drawn up. Preliminary studies of some of the Ministries and departments have&#13;
already been initiated.&#13;
Proiect Components:&#13;
77.    The project will consist of five components. (i) The Modernization of Public Sector Entities&#13;
component [US$ 32.5 million or 57.0% of total project cost of US$ 57.0 million] will assist in (a)&#13;
converting thirteen operational entities, mentioned in para 33, into 'Executive Agencies', above; and (b)&#13;
modernizing the central divisions, dealing with policy formulation; establishment of technical&#13;
standards; monitoring; coordination; and corporate management, of three Ministries, indicated in para&#13;
47, above. These entities will be granted greater autonomy in return for strict accountability for pre-&#13;
determined performance targets. They will also be provided with resources to modernize their&#13;
operations. (ii) The Privatization component [US$ 7.0 million or 12.2% of total project cost] will&#13;
finance engagement of consultants for (a) determination of different options available for private sector&#13;
participation in the water and sewerage sector and assisting GOJ in the implementation of the selected&#13;
option; (b) assisting in the privatization/contracting out of 30-35 other facilities and services; and (c)&#13;
institutional strengthening of the National Investment Bank of Jamaica (NIBJ), the lead agency for&#13;
privatization. (iii) The Government Procurement, Contracting, Internal Control and Auditing&#13;
component [US$ 2.0 million or 3.5% of total project cost] will provide assistance to the Procurement&#13;
Policy Implementation Unit, MOFP; Office of the Contractor General; Procurement/Contracting Units&#13;
and Committees in different Ministries; the Internal Audit Directorate, MOFP; and the Office of the&#13;
Auditor General. (iv) The Management Information Systems component [US$ 7.3 million or 12.8%&#13;
of total project cost] will complement the Financial and Program Management Improvement Project by&#13;
providing additional funding for software development, acquisition of hardware and training for the&#13;
Financial Management Information System (FMIS) and Human Resource Management Information&#13;
System (HRMIS). (v) Project Implementation, Communication Campaign and Development of&#13;
Stage II component [US$ 3.0 million or 5.3% of total project cost] will provide consultant services,&#13;
goods and training for implementation of the project, carrying out of an effective communication&#13;
campaign to facilitate project execution; and development of Stage 11 of the public sector modernization&#13;
process. Physical and price contingencies each amount to US$ 2.6 million or 4.6% of total project&#13;
cost.&#13;

Jamaica Public Sector Modernizatron Project:: SAR: 7/96                                           25&#13;
Project SustainabilitW:&#13;
78.    The modernization of operational agencies and core divisions of Ministries will be based on an&#13;
integrated approach that will seek to address inter-related organizational deficiencies in a&#13;
comprehensive manner. It is expected that the project would bring about lasting changes in the way&#13;
these entities do business. In the long-run, by modernizing the management practices and working&#13;
environments of the targeted entities, the project will help create a motivated group of public servants&#13;
who will have a vested interest in preserving and building on the improvements made through the&#13;
project. Also, the enhancement in quality of public service will create an external demand for&#13;
maintaining and increasing efficiency levels, besides consolidating political support for the reforms.&#13;
Privatization will help rid the public sector of activities that it cannot perform efficiently. It will&#13;
reduce the fiscal drain caused by inefficient enterprises and enable government to support continuing&#13;
reforms in the smaller public sector. The strengthening of procurement, contracting, internal control&#13;
and auditing will bring about long-term improvements in transparency and accountability. The&#13;
extension of the FMIS and HRMIS will lead to durable improvements in financial and personnel&#13;
management by providing up-to-date information in these areas to public sector managers. The phased&#13;
approach to public sector modernization being proposed by the project will keep change within the&#13;
absorptive limits of the public sector, thus, facilitating its acceptance and internalization. Financially,&#13;
the project will not impose a major recurrent burden on GOJ as the required improvements in the&#13;
compensation level of skilled positions in the targeted entities would be mainly financed by the&#13;
agencies themselves.&#13;
Lessons From Previous Bank Experience:&#13;
79.    Bank experience in related projects indicates that: (a) complex institution building projects&#13;
require government commitment at the highest level; (b) local ownership of reforms is imperative for&#13;
their success; (c) the right people, possessing the right skills and facing the right incentives, are crucial&#13;
to sustainability of institutional improvements; (e) civil service reform is a pre-requisite for&#13;
institutional development in the public sector6 (f) information technology can play a significant part in&#13;
enhancing organizational performance; (g) detailed project preparation is critical to effective&#13;
implementation; and (h) institutional change is facilitated by early successes. While designing the&#13;
project these lessons have been kept in mind. The proposed project closely reflects the priorities of&#13;
GOJ and enjoys the support of the Office of the Prime Minister. The development of the project&#13;
concept has been done in a highly participatory manner and inputs from a wide cross-section of&#13;
stakeholders have been sought and incorporated into the project concept and design. Further,&#13;
provision is being made for a continuing communication campaign during project implementation to&#13;
keep all interested constituencies adequately informed and reduce the anxiety that inevitably&#13;
accompanies major transitions. The project places due emphasis on improving the quality of human&#13;
resources in the civil service. Strategies for performance-linked improvements in compensation;&#13;
training and employee empowerment have been built into the project. Adequate provision has been&#13;
made for upgrading information technology in each of the targeted entities. Detailed implementation&#13;
plans and performance indicators have been developed to facilitate project implementation. Finally,&#13;
the project design aims at posting early successes. Some of the selected agencies are quite small in&#13;
organizational terms. Significant improvements in their performance would be sought in the initial&#13;

stages of project implementation so that they can be used as models to stimulate further change and&#13;
build credibility for the reform process.&#13;
PROJECT CONTEXT&#13;
Rafonale For Bank Involvement&#13;
80.   A robust public sector is essential for the success and sustainability of Jamaica's economic&#13;
reform program, which is being supported by a number of Bank operations. Consequently, public&#13;
sector reform and institutional strengthening are key objectives of the Bank's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on March 4, 1993. GOJ's Medium-Term Policy Framework&#13;
(MTPF) also emphasizes the need for greater administrative efficiency, improved public services and a&#13;
new role for the public sector as a facilitator of private sector-led growth. The Bank is already&#13;
involved in public sector reform projects in Jamaica. The proposed project is consistent with the Bank&#13;
Group Country Assistance Strategy. It would help take the reform process to the next stage, while&#13;
ensuring that two ongoing initiatives, viz. privatization and introduction of computerized financial and&#13;
personnel management systems, are carried to their logical conclusion. The Bank's vast and varied&#13;
experience in institutional development in the public sector would benefit the borrower in ensuring that&#13;
the proposed organizational changes are properly designed and effectively implemented.&#13;
ENVIRONMENT&#13;
81.   This project has been classified as category 'B" in recognition of potential environmental&#13;
effects of privatization activities. For the facilities and services already identified, a preliminary&#13;
environmental evaluation has been carried out. One facility, Food Storage Infestation (FSI), located at&#13;
Kingston and Montego Bay airports and used for quarantine of food for export, has been identified as&#13;
being possibly associated with some environmental issues. An environmental audit of the FSI will be&#13;
conducted prior to its privatization and suitable remedial actions will be taken to mitigate adverse&#13;
environmental impacts. Environmental Audit Guidelines have been developed and included in the&#13;
Operational Manual of the project. These will be followed during project implementation for&#13;
additional entities selected for privatization, whose activities, in the opinion of the Bank, may have a&#13;
negative environmental impact.&#13;
PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
82.    A PHRD Grant of Yen 61.5 million is being used for project preparation. The total project&#13;
cost of US$ 57.0 million includes an IBRD loan of US$ 28.4 million, repayable over seventeen years,&#13;
including a five year grace period, at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR based US Dollar&#13;
single currency loans. Parallel grant financing of UK Pounds 2.0 million (about US $3.0 million) will&#13;
be provided by the UK ODA. The European Union (EU) is also expected to provide parallel grant&#13;
financing of about US$ 3.0 million. This amount is included in GOJ's counterpart contribution of US$&#13;
25.6 million, pending finalization of the details of the EU project. Retroactive financing of US$ 2.0&#13;
million will be provided to meet expenditures incurred between January 1, 1996 and date of Loan&#13;
signing, mainly to purchase hardware for the FMIS and HRMIS and to finance studies related to the&#13;
water and sewerage sector. Table 2 indicates the Estimated Project Costs, Table 3 the Financing Plan&#13;
and Table 4 the Financing Plan by Category of Expenditure. Annex 5 indicates the detailed costs for&#13;
each project component.&#13;

project. The Inter-Ministerial Committee for Administrative Reform  (IMCAR)8 chaired by the Prime&#13;
Includes parallel financing of approximately USS 3.0 million expected from the European Union.&#13;
8lTe member of the IMCAR are: the Prime Minister (Chairman), Minister of Finance, Minister of State - Ministry of Finance, Minister of&#13;

Jamaica Public Sector Modernization Project:: SAR: 7/96                                       29&#13;
Minister, will provide high level support and policy direction. A Project Management Committee9,&#13;
chaired by the Cabinet Secretary, will oversee project implementation at the operational level. The&#13;
Management Committee will monitor the progress of various components of the project on a regular&#13;
basis and take appropriate actions to ensure that the objectives of the project are met. A Project&#13;
Coordination Unit (PCU), reporting to the Cabinet Secretary, has been established. The PCU has&#13;
actively participated in the preparation of the project. It will be responsible for the coordination of&#13;
different components of the project and for overall project management.&#13;
84.    The PCU is headed by a Project Director, who is an ex-officio member of the IMCAR&#13;
Working Group. The Project Director will have overall responsibility for the efficient implementation&#13;
of the project. The Senior Project Officer, already working in the PCU, will have responsibility for&#13;
coordinating the privatization component and providing assistance to the NIBJ, where required. He&#13;
will also manage all procurement activities under the project, besides providing project management&#13;
support to the Project Director. An International Coordinator, with experience in management of&#13;
change in public entities, will be appointed to guide the process of modernization of executive agencies&#13;
and Ministries. The agencies and Ministries will be divided into four groups. An Agency Coordinator&#13;
will be engaged for each group to facilitate the implementation process on a day to day basis. An&#13;
Information Technology Coordinator will be hired to establish uniform IT standards for the&#13;
computerization of various entities covered by the project and to assist in engagement of consultants&#13;
and procurement of computer hardware and software. A Coordinator will be appointed to facilitate the&#13;
implementation of the Government Procurement, Contracting, Internal Control and Auditing&#13;
component. For carrying out the proposed communication campaign, a Communication Specialist has&#13;
been appointed. A Finance and Accounting Manager will be appointed to look after project accounts.&#13;
In addition, two Secretaries and one Administrative Officer will be recruited for the PCU. The staff of&#13;
the PCU will be recruited on contract. Extensions of contracts of individual staff members will be&#13;
considered in light of their performance and the needs of the project, subject to the Bank's no-&#13;
objection. No extensions will be allowed beyond the completion of the project. An Operational&#13;
Manual containing guidelines on various facets of project management has been developed.&#13;
Recruitment of key PCU staff and adoption of the Operational Manual are conditions of Loan&#13;
Effectiveness.&#13;
85.    Project implementation will require extensive inter-institutional coordination. The&#13;
Modernization of Public Sector Entities component will be executed in coordination with the&#13;
management of each targeted entity and the respective Ministry. The Privatization component will be&#13;
implemented through the NIBJ, which would work closely with the PCU and the Cabinet Secretariat.&#13;
Signing of a Cooperation Agreement between GOJ and the NIBJ for the execution of the Privatization&#13;
Component is a condition of Loan Effectiveness. Under the Government Procurement, Contracting,&#13;
Internal Control and Auditing component, the setting up of the Procurement Policy Implementation&#13;
Unit and the Internal Audit Directorate will be coordinated with the Ministry of Finance; the&#13;
establishment and strengthening of Procurement Committees and Procurement/Contracting Units will&#13;
be coordinated with each Ministry; the creation and strengthening of the National Contracts&#13;
Commission and the Secretariat in the Office of the Contractor General (OCG) will be coordinated&#13;
with the OCG; and the strengthening of external auditing will be coordinated with the Office of the&#13;
Auditor General. The FMIS/HRMIS component will be executed through the Government&#13;
The Project Management Committee will consist of the Cabinet Secretary, Financial Secretary/Representative MOFP, Director General,&#13;
ERD, Executive Director, GARP, Finance and computerization specialists from the FPMIP, Project Director, Senior Project Officer, and&#13;
Finance and Accounting Manager. PSMP, and a representative of the private sector.&#13;

Administrative Reform Program. The Development of Stage n1 of Public Sector Modernization and&#13;
Communication Campaign will be the responsibility of the Project Coordination Unit.&#13;
B.    Project Implementation&#13;
86.   Given the wide scope of the project and the large number of entities involved, it is proposed to&#13;
adopt a phased implementation strategy. As would be evident from Annex 6, Project Implementation&#13;
Schedule, the creation of executive agencies and modernization of Ministries will be staggered so as to&#13;
keep the implementation burden on the PCU within reasonable limits. This will also enable the&#13;
experience gained with each batch of entities to be used to refine the strategy for succeeding batches.&#13;
The privatization of facilities and services will also be similarly phased.&#13;
87.   The PCU shall prepare and furnish to the Bank for its approval, an Annual Action Plan (AAP)&#13;
not later than December 31 of each fiscal year, starting in 1996. The submission of the AAP for fiscal&#13;
year 1996-97 will, however, be a condition of Loan Effectiveness. The AAP shall indicate, inter alia,&#13;
activities to be undertaken; the budget, sources of financing, start and end dates and implementation&#13;
responsibility for each activity; and plans for Procurement, Hiring of Consultants, Training and the&#13;
Information Campaign. It will also identify the entities or services to be taken up for privatization or&#13;
contracting out during the year. The AAP will form the basis of monitoring the progress of the&#13;
project. In order to ensure that project implementation is not adversely affected by the lack of&#13;
counterpart funds, GOJ will, by April 30 of each year, provide satisfactory evidence to the Bank&#13;
regarding the availability of such funds. Furnishing of the said evidence for FY 1996-97 will be a&#13;
condition of Loan Effectiveness. The PCU shall also submit semi-annual progress reports to the Bank&#13;
no later than April 30 and October 31 of each year, starting from 1997.&#13;
88.   At least two supervision missions will be organized by the Bank each year at which&#13;
implementation will be jointly reviewed with GOJ and actions to deal with problems and bottlenecks&#13;
encountered will be agreed. One of the supervision missions will be used to carry out an Annual&#13;
Review of the project before 30th June of each year. A mid-term review of the project will be carried&#13;
out as part of the 1999 Annual Review. To the extent possible the supervision missions will be&#13;
coordinated with similar missions of other donors participating in the project. In any event, close&#13;
coordination with them will be maintained to ensure consistency of approach. Progress made in&#13;
project implementation will be monitored through Key Project Indicators (Annex 1). Suitable remedies&#13;
have been included in the Loan Agreement to deal with the failure of the targeted agencies and&#13;
Ministries, on the one hand, and GOJ, on the other, to properly implement Framework Documents&#13;
mentioned above. Also, remedies have been provided in case of non-availability, suspension or&#13;
cancellation of parallel grant financing from the ODA and the EU.&#13;
89.    GOJ shall prepare an Operational Plan for the future operation of the Project, not later than six&#13;
months after the closing date of the Project. This plan will be jointly reviewed by the Bank and GOJ&#13;
with a view to ensure the sustainability of the reforms introduced by the Project.&#13;
C      Procurement&#13;
90.    Goods: Procurement of goods under the proposed project will be carried out in accordance&#13;
with "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Modernization Project:: SAR: 7/96                                   31&#13;
January 1995 as revised in January 1996. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents, modified as&#13;
appropriate, will be used for all ICB and LIB procurement.&#13;
91.    Goods, such as computer systems, including hardware, software and peripherals; instruments&#13;
required for the operations of various entities; teaching aids; air-conditioners; and other office&#13;
equipment estimated to cost US$ 10.6 million would be acquired through International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB), in packages valued at not less than US$ 150,000 each. Some of aforesaid goods valued&#13;
at US$ 50,000 or more, but less than US$ 150,000 per contract, and not exceeding US$ 1.0 million in&#13;
the aggregate, would be procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB). Contracts for the&#13;
supply of the goods will include installation, maintenance and technical assistance for at least one year&#13;
after the first year of warranty provided by the manufacturer. Goods that cannot be grouped in bid&#13;
packages of US$ 50,000 or more, but can be grouped in packages of US$ 25,000 and above, would be&#13;
procured through international shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank, for an aggregate amount&#13;
not to exceed US$ 400,000. Goods, costing less than US$ 25,000 per contract, will be procured&#13;
through national shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank, for an aggregate amount not exceeding&#13;
US$ 100,000.&#13;
92.    All contracts for procurement of goods to be awarded through ICB and LIB would be subject to&#13;
prior review by the Bank and the remaining contracts would be subject to ex-post review by supervision&#13;
missions. The Bank's prior review of procurement documentation would cover all major procurement&#13;
steps, including invitation to bid, advertising, bidding documents, evaluation methodologies and&#13;
reports, award recommendations and contracts.&#13;
93.    Consulting Services: A plan for hiring consultants would be submitted to the Bank for review&#13;
and approval as part of the Annual Action Plan, before consultants are hired. The selection and&#13;
appointment of consultants would be in accordance with the World Bank: "Guidelines: Use of&#13;
Consultants by Ubrld Bank Borrowers and the Ubrld Bank as Executing Agency" published by the Bank&#13;
in August 1981. The Bank's Standard Letters of Invitation and Standard Forms of Contract for&#13;
Consultant's Services would be adapted, as appropriate, to each assigmment and used for contracting all&#13;
technical assistance under the loan.&#13;
94.    All consultant contracts would be subject to full prior review, in accordance with Bank&#13;
Guidelines, including that of: (a) preparation of the terms of reference and budget; (b) choice of&#13;
selection procedure; (c) preparation of the Short List and the Letter of Invitation; (d) the winning&#13;
proposal and the Evaluation Report; and (e) the draft contract. However, consultant contracts estimated&#13;
to cost below US$ 50,000 for firms and US$ 20,000 for individuals, except the first two contracts in&#13;
each category, would require only the review of the terms of reference, qualifications, experience, and&#13;
conditions of employment of the selected consultants on an ex-ante basis. Supporting documents for&#13;
these contracts would be reviewed selectively on an ex-post basis. This exception to the Bank's review&#13;
shall not, however, apply to assignments involving single source selection of firms; assignments of a&#13;
critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank; amendments to the contracts for the employment&#13;
of firms raising the value of such contracts to US$ 50,000 or above; and amendments to the contracts&#13;
for the employment of individuals raising the value of such contracts to US$ 20,000 or above.&#13;
Contracts with consulting firms valued at US$ 50,000 or below will not exceed US$ 3.0 million in&#13;
aggregate.&#13;

95.     The limits established for prior Bank review of procurement decisions are expected to result in&#13;
a coverage of about 80% of Bank-financed contracts.&#13;
96.     The borrower's procurement regulations and procedures have been reviewed by Bank staff in&#13;
the context of previous projects and the country procurement assessment and have been found to be&#13;
generally consistent with Bank guidelines.&#13;
97.      Training and Infornation Campaign:  After the Annual Action Plan relating to Training and&#13;
the Information Campaign has been approved, expenditures under these categories would be made&#13;
against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs).&#13;
98.     Civil Wrks: The entire cost of construction of new buildings and refurbishing of old buildings&#13;
will be financed by GOJ according to its local procedures.&#13;

99.    The Borrower's Financial Administration and Audit Act, as amended up to July 1992, has been&#13;
reviewed during appraisal and has been found to be acceptable for use with a Special Account.&#13;
100.   The proceeds of the Loan would be disbursed against 100% of foreign expenditures and 85%&#13;
of local expenditures on Goods, and 100% of expenditures on Consultants, Training and Information&#13;
Campaign. Table 7 indicates different categories of expenditures to be financed by the Loan, the&#13;
allocation of the loan amount to each category and the percentage of expenditures to be financed in&#13;
each category. The Loan, including retroactive financing of US$ 2.0 million, is expected to be&#13;
disbursed by the end of the fifth year of project implementation. A Special Account in US Dollars,&#13;
with an authorized allocation of US$ 2.0 million, equivalent to an estimated four months of average&#13;
disbursements, will be established in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. During the start-up of&#13;
the project, the PCU will be able to request up to US$ 1.0 million as an initial deposit to the Special&#13;
Account. After disbursements and commitments from the loan account have reached US$ 5.0 million,&#13;
the PCU would be able to request up to the authorized allocation. Disbursements against contracts not&#13;
subject to Bank prior review would be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Table 8 gives&#13;
the estimated disbursements by fiscal year.&#13;

E.    Accounting and Audits&#13;
101.  The PCU will maintain records and accounts to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting&#13;
practices, the operations, resources and expenditures for each project component. The accounts will be&#13;
consolidated annually to prepare the financial statements for the project as a whole. Supporting&#13;
documentation will be maintained by the PCU and made available to Bank missions and independent&#13;
auditors for scrutiny, as required. For expenditures incurred on the basis of Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOEs) all records (contracts, orders, invoices, bills, receipts and other documents) evidencing such&#13;
expenditures will be retained by the PCU until at least one year after the Bank has received the audit&#13;
report for the Fiscal Year in which the last withdrawal from the Loan Account or payment out of the&#13;
Special Account, whichever is later, was made.&#13;
102.  Project records and accounts, including the Special Account and SOEs, will be audited&#13;
annually in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by external&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, with terms of reference for auditors and reports approved&#13;
by the Bank. The Bank's "Financial Accounting, Reporting, and Auditing Handbook (FARAH)"&#13;
published in January 1995 would be used by the independent auditors in accordance with Bank auditing&#13;
guidelines. Cost of the consultant services to be employed for the annual audits (US$ 25,000&#13;
equivalent through the life of the project) will be eligible for financing under the loan. Audit reports&#13;
will be furnished to the Bank within three months after close of the Government's fiscal year.&#13;
PROJECT RISKS AND BENEFITS&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
103.  The major risks are: waning of political commitment to the project; the unwillingness of the&#13;
government to grant adequate autonomy to the executive agencies; the lack of dynamic and inspiring&#13;
leaders in the targeted agencies; and the mismanagement of the complex organizational change process.&#13;
The project is being designed to achieve observable improvements in some of the targeted public&#13;
services within a short time period. Such early successes would demonstrate the feasibility and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Jamaica Public Sector Modernization Project:: SAR: 7/96                                   35&#13;
benefits of the strategy adopted by the project, thus, firming up government commitment. External&#13;
factors, such as the growing public demand for improved public services and the need for an efficient&#13;
public sector to facilitate private sector growth, would also keep the government committed to public&#13;
sector modernization. Discussions with GOJ have indicated that the government is keen on creating&#13;
executive agencies and would be willing to grant them the requisite autonomy. To further reduce the&#13;
related risk, disbursements for the executive agencies and Ministries would be linked to the execution&#13;
of Framework Documents, satisfactory to the Bank. Appropriate remedies have also been incorporated&#13;
in the Loan Agreement to guard against unwarranted withdrawal of autonomy granted to the entities&#13;
covered by the project. To ensure high quality leadership in the executive agencies, the appointment&#13;
of CEOs acceptable to the Bank has been made a condition for disbursement. It is expected that a&#13;
strong PCU, working closely with the agencies involved in the project, will ensure that the&#13;
organizational changes in the Ministries and executive agencies are managed effectively.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
104.  Conversion of public entities into performance oriented executive agencies, operating with&#13;
greater autonomy and a modern resource base, will significantly improve quality of services provided&#13;
by them to their clients. Strengthening the central divisions in Ministries will improve the quality of&#13;
public policies and enhance government control over their implementations. The experience gained in&#13;
the pilot agencies targeted by the project, will set the stage for modernizing the rest of the public&#13;
sector. Privatization of activities that can be better performed by the private sector will increase&#13;
competition and benefit consumers, enable the public sector to focus on its core competencies and&#13;
reduce the fiscal burden imposed by inefficient public enterprises. Strengthening of procurement and&#13;
contracting will ensure that government receives value for money for the huge annual outlays on&#13;
goods, works and services. Improving internal control and auditing will enhance accountability and&#13;
transparency in public financial management and ensure that delegated financial powers are exercised&#13;
properly. Finally, the extension of the FMIS and HRMIS will improve efficiency in financial and&#13;
personnel management in the public sector as a whole.&#13;
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND LOAN CONDITIONS&#13;
105.  Agreements Reached at Negotiations:&#13;
*  It was agreed that, against the provision that had been made at Appraisal for the inclusion&#13;
of two additional agencies under the Modernization of Public Sector Entities component,&#13;
Jamaica Promotions Corporation (JAMPRO) and the Construction Division of the Ministry&#13;
of Local Government and Works would be included in the component.&#13;
*  It was agreed that the objectives of privatization of the water and sewerage sector were to&#13;
(a) provide an efficient and reliable supply of water and sewerage services at the least&#13;
economic cost; (b) attract foreign and local private finance and broaden ownership; and (c)&#13;
promote environmentally acceptable operation of the water and sewerage sector. The&#13;
recommendations of a diagnostic study are currently being reviewed by government.&#13;
Informed by the findings of the study, GOJ plans to introduce a Water Policy Paper that&#13;
would outline a process for rational development and use of the island's water resources&#13;
and sewerage treatment and disposal facilities. The second phase of the study will address&#13;
the institutional, regulatory, legal and financial implications of the recommended policy.&#13;
Based on the results of the second phase study, GOJ is likely to take a decision by March&#13;

GOVERNMENT OF JAMAICA CURRENT DEVELOPMENTAL OBJECTiVES&#13;
The major focus of thc government's developmentl agenda during the next three&#13;
years, will be on four (4) broad areas. These are macroeconomic stability, increased&#13;
invcstrnent, improvcd Public Sector efficiency and pov?rty reduction.&#13;
In the short term, mamroeconomic stability i.e. luwcring the rate of inflation and ensuring the&#13;
viability of the extcmal sector will be given top priority. A major initative in this regard is&#13;
the development of a National Partnership as a complementary measure to fiscal and&#13;
monctary measures to reduce inflation. The government has cinbarked on a major uxercise to&#13;
induce the social partners in the economy  -ade unions and the private sectors along with the&#13;
public sector) to adhere to a more balanced adjustment or prices and incomes. The&#13;
governmcnts contribution to the process will include consistent monetry and fiscal policies&#13;
to cnsure exchange rate stability as well as institutional changcs. In this regard, improved&#13;
regulations governing the moneLary sector will be implcmented shortly. As part of the fiscal&#13;
efforts expenditure will be contained to targeted levels consistcnt with the broader&#13;
stabilition objcctive. The govemment intends to restructure it's debt over a longer period&#13;
of time, cffecting a more manageable repayment schedule and containing the level of annual&#13;
recurient expenditures.&#13;
With regard to capital expenditure, inFrastructural development will rcmain an integral&#13;
part of the govcrnment's programme of expenditure. The government recognises its role in&#13;
providing the necessary infrastructure to supporL private sector activities, production and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

hence growth. niis will dircctly impact on the productivity of sectors like agriculture.&#13;
ranufacturing, transportation and distribution, whose outpuLs are directly linked to the state&#13;
of the country's infrastructurr. In addition the govemment reCogni7.s the need to build local&#13;
govcrnment and the public sector as a whole, to mrakc them more erricient in carryin, out&#13;
their roles in the economy, and in parricularuin facilating the needs of the private sector.&#13;
There is also the need ror an increase in living standar)s by tackling the most acute form of&#13;
poverty as a way of building support for the national thrst and macroeconomic policy.&#13;
In pursuit of these developmental goals the govemrnment will vigorously implement the&#13;
following projccts.&#13;
1.    The Parish Infrastrucnr Project;&#13;
2.     The Modernization of the Public Sector, and;&#13;
3.     The Social Investment Fund (SIF).&#13;
The Parish Infrastructure Project:&#13;
The Parish Infrastructure project forms part of the institutional reform of the Local&#13;
Govermment Reform Programme (LGRP) and is designed to support this programme by&#13;
helping to build the capacities of parishes and local communitics to perform the new roles&#13;
and responsibilities to help advance the three (3) overall objectives. The Parish&#13;
Infrastructure project is thus designed to complement the LGRP through provision of&#13;
invcstfrent funds to restore major clemcnts of pansh intrastructure which have suffered&#13;
erosion due to neglert and insufficient maintenance.&#13;
The project has as its main objectives (as stmted in the project document):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7        105&#13;
. .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~O&#13;
4&#13;
a)     Support of the Local Govimrnment Reforrn by mnlang it a rcality in the local&#13;
communities, thus cnsuring a consaituency to sustain thcse reforms in the long run.&#13;
b)    Strengthening the financial viability and capacity of parishes and  local&#13;
communities to manage and rnaintain infrastructure systems and to improve the&#13;
delivery of service.&#13;
C)    Assisting in anr-sting the deterioration of the infstructure in the parishes and local&#13;
communitics, thus  fostering the resumption of economic developmcnt in thesm&#13;
areas.&#13;
d)    Helping to alleviate povcrty in parish communities, with particular emphasis on rural&#13;
and inner-city areas.&#13;
Thc project has thrce major components which should facilitate the achievemnent of the&#13;
above objectives. The first is a technical assistance component for instiLution building. This&#13;
incorporates a strengthening of the parishes' administrative, financial management, and&#13;
tchnical capacitics. This component will also ensure the availability of selectve support for&#13;
the provision of facilitics, cquipmenL and training to institutions which dcliver services to the&#13;
paihes.&#13;
The second comnponent is that of investments designed to arrcst the dctcioraLion of&#13;
major infrastructure. This aspect will be targeted and prioritized, and will be subject to&#13;
environmental considetions.&#13;
nTe third component is or a social nature which will initiate a social assessment and&#13;
participatory approach in investment lending for poverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX7'    106&#13;
Thc major beneficiaries of the projcct are expccted to include the small business and&#13;
farning sectors as well as the strcngthening of the local communities' administrLion and&#13;
fiscal discipline.&#13;
Modernization of the Public Sector:&#13;
The scope and size of the public sectur has increased substantially over the past thirty (3)&#13;
years. There are approxirately seventy cight thousand 6E8,000) posts, permanent or temporary&#13;
within the public sector. Despite or, possibly bccause of the size of the public sector, its&#13;
performance is generally considered to be weak and the quality of service to the public less than&#13;
optimal. This occurs because of poor, Inter alia, management, cumbersome bureaucratic&#13;
procedures, inadcquately trained staff, lack of automation or computerization, low levels of&#13;
compensation and the centraliation of authority.&#13;
The consequences of a sub-optimally-performing public sector also affects private sor&#13;
development. Successive governments havc implemented a number of reform measures with&#13;
varying degrees of success. Thnc government's growing recognition of the need for a more&#13;
re-sponsive (proacLive) public sector, has motivated the conceptualization of te Public Sector&#13;
Modernzation Projcct (PSMP) which proposes to create a smnall, efricient, effective and&#13;
accountable public sctor that dlivcrs high quality service to the people.&#13;
The primary component of this project is the rationalizaLion of the public sector which&#13;
will etail:&#13;
i)     Privatizaton of some public sector entities including contracting out of thoase wrvices that&#13;
can be delivered more effectively and cfficicntly by the privale sector,&#13;
ii)    Down-sizing and stengthening the rcquircd work-force;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7  107&#13;
6&#13;
iii)    Abolishing redundant statutory bodies anid government companies;&#13;
iv)    The creation of executive agencies.&#13;
The concept behind the creation or executive agencies is a new one to Jamaica. Ile&#13;
primary aim is to reduce excessivc cantralization of control and to delegate authority to managen&#13;
in Central Civil Service Departments or Agencies i.e. those not created by statute or fall under&#13;
The Companies Act.  This will enable them to to  dccisions in the intcrcst of their&#13;
organizations with the focus on results shown in the provision of high quality goods and&#13;
services.&#13;
The governmcnt is committed to the rapid implementalion of the Public Sector&#13;
Modernization Project to achieve the stated objectives. The first major phase of the project to&#13;
be implemented within the first half of the year 1996, involves restructuring on a pilot basis, the&#13;
'inistry of Local Governmit and Worlm and the Ministry ofEnvironmwnt and Housing, eleven&#13;
(11) departments of govemment tareLed for Executive Agency StaLus and the privaizadon of&#13;
some- govemnment agencies.&#13;
In the meantime, other meanurcs such as the reviewing of conditions of service as they&#13;
affect arcas like leave, hases ror redrement and pensions wiLh the views of maidn, the service&#13;
more erficient as well as being ablc to attract and retain persons of high competence.&#13;
The Jamaica Social Investment Fund (SIF):&#13;
Ihe Government, in enunciating its poverty cradication policy, makes refcrcnce to thc&#13;
distinction between private poveny (which is sufferd by an individual when he or she cannot&#13;
afford to meet his or her basic needs) and public poverty (which exists when a society fin&amp;ls itself&#13;
unable to make adequate provision of the basic public goods such as roads, water, sanitation and&#13;

transport).&#13;
The policy accepts that boLh kinds of poverty exist in Jamaica at an unacceptable high&#13;
level. It also recognises that poverty is inherently multifaceted and demands a multifaceted&#13;
straegy consisting of a range of anti-poverty interventions designed and iniplernented by an&#13;
efficient operational partnership between the Governmcnt itself, the beneficiaries, non-&#13;
governmental organizations, oLher coLnmunuty-based bodies and the private scctor.&#13;
Government has indicated that its cradication policy must work towards the achievement&#13;
of the following three thrusts:&#13;
i)    the introduction of efficient, equitable and flexible human rcsourec decvlopmcnt&#13;
strategies;&#13;
ii)    the amendment of the existing welfare system so as to widen its coverage of needy&#13;
persons, so as to streamline it for mom efricient adminis=tion and so as to rcst its&#13;
operations on the principle Lhat only temporary relief should be available to pcrsons able&#13;
in body and mind; and&#13;
iii)   the implementation of an integrated programne of poverty reduction activitics&#13;
geographically targeted to deprived communities.&#13;
In identifying a poverty eradication strategy, the Government has made reference to&#13;
programmes within a Social Agenda which is a priority for its administration. This Social&#13;
Agerttda will receive the resources, the sustaincd cffort and participation of all sectors of the&#13;
society towards achieving specific social objectives.&#13;
The present policy direction of the Social Agenda will differ significantly from past&#13;
approaches. Its guiding principles will be that of integration, partnership and community-based&#13;

a.    The establishment of the Human Rcsource Developmnct Programme   to  empower&#13;
individuals to achieve sclf-development through  training and improvements in the&#13;
quality of cducation.&#13;
b.    Individuals and their community organitions will be empowered to identify their needs,&#13;

c.    The facilitation of income genemting activities through the provision of credit and&#13;
ensuring the participation of small and micro businesses in the economic sector.&#13;
d.    All actors in civil society will be assured a participatory role in the development process,&#13;
through a system of consultation and representadon at various levels of Lhe system.&#13;
C.    An improvernent in the delivery of basic social services, including shelter, to ensure that&#13;
there is optimal use of Government resources and that these efforts will have a positive&#13;
impact on communities.&#13;
The lamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) is one important mechanism within the&#13;
Government's Social Agenda. Its establishment is considered an imnportant tool in the reduction&#13;
of public and private poverty in Jamaica and embodies a mechanism which would be adopting&#13;
and 'Jamaicanizina- a straLegy which has to date been adopted with support froin the World&#13;
Banlc acting in collaboration with other bilateral financing agencies in more than thirty other&#13;
countries with similar problems.&#13;
The primary goal of the Fund is to contribute to the reduction and eradication of poverty&#13;
and to create an environment for sustainable national development. More specifically, the Fund&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7 110&#13;

is designed to assist the Government in responding to the neods of the most vulnerable groups&#13;
currently undeserved by existing povcrty rcduction programmes. Tne objectives of JSIF will be&#13;
to:&#13;
i)     Establish an efficient, demand-driven and complementary&#13;
mechanism lo deliver basic services and infrastnucture to the poor;&#13;
ii)    Mobilise and channel addiLional resources to the pcas social assistancc and basic social&#13;

iii)   Increasc thc institutional capacity of governmental and non governmental enlilies to&#13;
design, implement, and manage small scale community based projects; and&#13;
iv)    Expand community opportunities to identify local socio economic needs and manage and&#13;
sustain smal scale coinmuniLy development projects.&#13;
The government is convinced that implementing these projects will make a significant&#13;
contuibution to stabilizing the economy, reducing poverty and engendering growth and&#13;
development. The government is also thankful for Lhe support of the World Bank in&#13;
implementing these projects.&#13;

Dear Mr. Gill:&#13;
Re: Statement of Government on the nature and extent of the autonomy to be granted&#13;
The Govemment of Jamaica is committed to the establishment of "Executiye Agencies" as a method of modemizing&#13;
and stream-lining the public sector. Central to the implementation of the Public Sector Modernzation Project, are&#13;
"Executive Agencies" with the requisite autonomy to manage totally the affairs of the agency. The proposed&#13;
autonomy includes jurisdic;icn of ,he financial and human resource management They will be headed by a Chief&#13;
Executive Officer, serving under contract, whose autonomy will be balanced by requests for strict accountability in&#13;
accordance with pre-determined performance targets. Resources to modernize their operabons will be provided.&#13;
Granting autonomy in financial and personnel management is one of the important elements in the modemizaton&#13;
strategy.&#13;
The Jamaican Constitution, the F;.-ancial Administration and Audit Act. Staff Orders and Public Service Regulabons&#13;
allow for flexibility through administrative fiats. As an initial step in establishing "Executive Agencies," the Govemor&#13;
General and the Minister of Finance will be asked to grant the requisite administrative fiats required to create&#13;
"Executive Agencies" within the present legal and administrative framework. At a later date, legislaton will be&#13;
introduced to facilitate the creation of new "Executive Agencies."&#13;
Other major considerations include the strengthening of the internal audit mechanism and extending the Financial&#13;
Management Information System (FMIS) to the selected agencies. A management team resident within the&#13;
respectve agencies will work closely with the Project Coordinating Unit, to plan, monitor and evaluate the progress&#13;
of implem4ntation. The Interministerial Committee on Administrative Reform will oversee the entire process, directed&#13;
by the Cabinet Secretary.&#13;

PROPOSALS FOR DECENTRALIZING THE MACHINERY OF&#13;
GOVERNMENT THE ESTABLISHMELqT OF EXECUTIVE AGENCIES.&#13;
INTRODIJCTION&#13;
1.   The Executive branch of government established by the Constitution and laws&#13;
of Jamaica is based on the constitutional norms known as the Westminster&#13;
model of parliamentary democracy. It embodies a highly centralized structure&#13;
with agencies are gouped in departments under ministries which reflect the&#13;
particular rmix of subjects in the structure of government designated by each&#13;
Primc Minister. There is no constitutional norm establishing the core of the&#13;
public service and establishing the structure and organization of goverment in&#13;
ministres or departments.&#13;
2.   The centralization is characterized by a Civil Service which has a common&#13;
personnel and human resource systcm  supervised by the Public Service&#13;
Commission undcr the Constitution and a set of rules for fmancial prudence&#13;
-.and administration supervised by the Ministry of Finance under the Financial&#13;
Administration and Audit Act. This Act does not have special constitutional&#13;
status but includes provisions that are envisioned by the Constitution.&#13;
3.    The Government of Jamaica has embarked on a programme of refonn of the&#13;
Public Sector to sccure a 'small efficient  piiblic service, able to respond&#13;
flexibly to need, rccovering as rnmch of its costs as possible from fees and with&#13;

delegatcd authority as far as possible within separate agencies.'' The World&#13;
Bank has comnmissioned this study to identify options available to the&#13;
Government of Jamaica for the achievement of the objective of significantly&#13;
delegating the dccision-making fimctions within Jamaica's constitutional and&#13;
legal framework&#13;
4.   This study examines the structure of Executive Agencies carried out in the&#13;
United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, New Zealand and explores the extent&#13;
to which tey can be replicated in Jamaica. There are some other experiences&#13;
in countries which have adopted the Wesuninster form of government, but the&#13;
time within which this study has been commissioned does not allow for their&#13;
carefuil examination.&#13;
THE EXPERIENCE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM&#13;
5.   Next Steps is the name that the British government gave to the Civil service&#13;
reforms under which Executive Agencies were set up to deliver government&#13;
services.2 The reports that led to the establishment of Next Steps recognized&#13;
that&#13;
a) 'although the main business of some 95% of the Civil Service was to&#13;
' deliver services, operational efficiency attracted a low priority among&#13;

senior people compared with giving policy advice to Minister,'&#13;
b) ' the Civil Service was still largely governed by a body of centrally&#13;
laid down rules, even though it was too bil and too divers to be managed&#13;
as a single entity,'&#13;
c) 'central controls prevented local managers from being able to make&#13;
decisions in thc best interests of their own opprations.'"&#13;
6.    The solution that was recommended and which has been imnplenented was the&#13;
separation of thc executive fwLictions of government from the policy-makcing&#13;
role and the dissolution of the centrally controlled management structure. The&#13;
old structure has been largely replaced by a number of executive agencies in&#13;
which there is delegation of personal responsibility for the effective delivery of&#13;
igh quality and responsive services to the public. By September 1994 62% of&#13;
the British Civil Scrvice were working in the new system which now has over&#13;
1 00 agencies and there are plans for the Revenue departments and a further&#13;
17% of the functions of the civil iwnice to be agency candidates.'  113 Chief&#13;
Executive otTicers had been appointed up to August 1995, 71 of whom as a&#13;
rcsult of the posts being advertised, aid 35 of them coming from busMess and&#13;
outside the Civil Service.'&#13;

imperilling  the control of public expenditure '   The British Govemment,&#13;
through Prime Minister Major, has concluded that these changes bave&#13;
introduced more transparency into the work of Govermnent, within the&#13;
constitutional principle that it is Ministers who are accountable to Parliament&#13;
for all that their departments (including agencies) do."&#13;
S.   A significant factor in the success of thc refonns in Britain has been the fact&#13;
that they received strong support from Mrs. -Margaret Thatcher, the Prime&#13;
Minister at the time when the initial steps were taken. Her supporn was&#13;
* uquivocal and was characterized by the directness and brevity of ber speech&#13;
in the House of Commons wbhn the proposals were first presented.  This&#13;
comaiitrnent has been followed by her successor Mr. John Major.&#13;

annual public meetings musct be held to solicit public reaction to their&#13;
performance.&#13;
10.  The lcpl framework that the British government has established for the&#13;
creation of Execujtivc agencies has restcd partly on lcgislation and partly on the&#13;
exercise of thc royal prerogative. The legislation is the Govemrnment Trading&#13;
Act 1973, The Govcrrunent Trading 1990, The Property Services Agency and&#13;
Crown Suppliers Act 1990 and The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act&#13;
1990. The Govcmrent Trading Act 1990 amended the 1973 Act and provides&#13;
for the financing by trading fimds of certain services of the Crown.&#13;
11   The Ministcrs responsible for the admninistation of certain  government&#13;
services may. if it appears to them expedient in the interests of improved&#13;
commcrcial operatiou and public accountability of a service, by order made&#13;
with thc concurrence of the Treasury, direct that the service shall be financed&#13;
by mcan of a trding fimd established with public money, instead of by means&#13;
of anmual budget votcs and appropriations. Orders must be made by statutory&#13;
#ipsnMcnts which must be laid in draft forn before the House of Commons and&#13;
approved by resolution by that House. The initial capital for the fund is&#13;
normally provided by way of a loan from the National Loan Fund.&#13;

operate with targcts sinilar to those used by equivalent service providers in the&#13;

April 1996.'3&#13;
14.  The Property Services Agency and Crown Suppliers Act 1990 gives the&#13;
Secretary of State power to makc schemes for the 'ansfer to persons of&#13;
property, rights and liabilities to whicii a Minister of the. Crown is entitled.&#13;
The schemes may confer liabilities for the purpose of converting into a contract&#13;
between the transferce under it and a Minuster of the Crown any arrangements&#13;
existing before the existence of the scheme under which goods and services&#13;
were being provided. These schemes can also include companies formed or&#13;
acquired by the Secretary of State.&#13;
i 5.  These statutes havc not been relied on for the creation of the majority of the&#13;
cxecutive agencies that havc been formed in Britain. By virtue of the Royal&#13;
Prerogative thc sovercign is the supreme executive authority in the state and all&#13;
executive actionsare done in the nmne of the sovereigi." "Ministcrs rely daily&#13;
on the royal prerogative for what they do. That Miristers can rely on that part&#13;

Ministers are obviously not limited by the terms of any Act of Parliament."&#13;
a.   The ability of the British cabinet minister to rely on this residuary power&#13;
not only made it relatively simple for the creation of executive agencies&#13;
but also sharply distinguishcs the legal constraints that exist under the&#13;
unwritten constitutional govemance of that system and the written&#13;
Westminster model in Jamaica.&#13;
THE NEW ZEALAND EXPERIENCE&#13;
16.  It is instructive to look at the experiences of a Commonwealth nation that has&#13;
becn modeled on the Westminster systcm. New Zealand undertook a radical&#13;
progranmme of reform its economy and the managcment of public&#13;
administration. These reforms have been at. the forefront of the political&#13;
agendas of the political parties for over 10 years, and it was recognized that&#13;
total reform  of the systems of government management was required to&#13;
accompany the economic reforms vvhich were designed to redefine the role of&#13;
government. Like the British the New Zcalanders set out to separate policy&#13;
advice from the operational units which have responsibility for the&#13;
administration of that policy. They established arm's length contractual&#13;
arrangements between the govcrnment's role as funder, purchaser and provider&#13;
of services both to the govcrnment and to the public directly. They also&#13;
developed stuctures that promoted competition between government providers&#13;

17.  There were two process by which the transformation was achieved. One was&#13;
by corporatizatior' under the Companies Act and the appointment of directors&#13;
witl private sector experience, who wcre not selected because of their political&#13;
connections. The other process was the radical reform of the core of the&#13;
government administration under a system that saw the introduction of The&#13;
State Sector Act and the Public Finance Act, that require government&#13;
departmcnts and non-commercial departments to (a) have clearly defined&#13;
strategic and operational objectives, (b) decentralize financial and&#13;
administrative management and accept accountability for results, (c) receive&#13;
allocations from State funds through the Budget based on achievement of&#13;
results, (d) publish information on thc results that had been achieved and the&#13;
condition of the organization. The new system is described by Scott C.&#13;
Graham, visiting scholar at the New Zealand Fiscal Affairs Department of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance in these words; " the Mini-vier, acting within the collective&#13;
respunsibility of the Cabinet, is fifrmally respon ible fimr specitjing the&#13;

18.  The New Zealand constitution does not have the kind of constraints that exist&#13;
under the Jamaican Constitution. As a result the two Acts established the&#13;
framework for performance agreements between the Ministers and the Chief&#13;
Executives and he Chief Executives are the legal cmployers of the staff of the&#13;
depart;ments. This radical departure from the old civil service model has taken&#13;
place in a context where the laws tleniTselves shifi of the focus of the&#13;
managernct system and the allocation of resources from imputs to outputs. The&#13;
objective is to givc Parliamcnt control over the disposition of public funds.&#13;
19.  In the section of Scott' paper which deals with the Operational Financial&#13;
Management he lists 14 charactenistics of the framework surrounding a Chief&#13;
Executive, which include, (i) an employment contract for 5 years with a&#13;
possible cxtension based on perfonnance, (ii) possibility of receiving&#13;
perfornance bonuses for above-expectation performance or criticism or&#13;
dismissal for below expected performance, (iii) freedom to manage staff&#13;
without central regulations, (iv) budget based on rcsources for output&#13;

THE JAMAICAN CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
"Ibid page 89&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 9 122&#13;
11&#13;
20.  By Section 68 of the Jamaican Conistitution executive authority m Jamaica is&#13;
vested in the Queen This authority is exercised on her behalf by the Govemor-&#13;
Generl either directly or through subordinate officers. parliament has the&#13;
power to confer executive fimctions on persons and authorities other than the&#13;
Governor-General.&#13;
21.  Section 77 of the Constitution of Jamaica recognizes the division of the&#13;
organization of the central govemment into ministries. This is done by the&#13;
assigiment of subjects to Cabinet Ministers by the Governor-General on the&#13;
advice of the Prime Minister. Ministers excrcise general direction and control&#13;
over the departbnents but the supervision of them rests with the Permaent&#13;
Secretary (Section 93). The Constitution makes no provisions as to how the&#13;
intenal organization of the departments are organized and recognizes through&#13;
the provisions thal it mikes relating to the personnel functions relating to public&#13;
officrs that delegation of thesc fmcntions is contemplated. Section 127 permits&#13;
the delegation by the Governor-General of the appointment, removal and&#13;
discipline of public officers to 'any other authority or public officer' as he may&#13;
specify.&#13;
22.  The provisions relating to Finance are contained in Chapter VIII and do not&#13;
contain specific terms rclating to the management of the finances of&#13;
dcpartnents and agencies of Govenunent. Section 116 contemplates that the&#13;
estimates of expenditure which the Minister responsible for f&amp;ance prepares&#13;
will be incorporated in an Appropriation Bill which will be broken down into&#13;
'appropriate heads Ibr the sevcral services required ' during the financial ycar.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 9 123&#13;
12&#13;
The detailed regimc for achieving good order in the financial administration of&#13;
the public sector is contained in the Financial Administration and Audit Act.&#13;
The Minister of Finance has specific power to make regulations and in some&#13;
cases to delegate his powers to Accounting and Accountable officers.&#13;
23.  It would be a simplistic approach to the speedy transformation of the existing&#13;
Jamaican administrative Civil service structures to merely copy the legislative&#13;
framework within which the British government has established Executive&#13;
Agencies. It overlooks the fact that the Bn'tish Govement does not operate&#13;
wthin the context of a wntten constitution. In addition it is enToneously assume&#13;
that because Jamaican governance is based on Westninster parliamentary&#13;
denocracy that this in itself ensures that the threads that make up the fabric of&#13;
British political culture are of the same genus as those that hold political&#13;
practice together in Jamaica.&#13;
24..  The significant difference between Britain and Jamaica is that parliamentary&#13;
democracy in Britain operates in an environment in which the power of the&#13;
Legislature over the Executive has been cxercised from time to time and that&#13;
the accoumtability of the Executive to the Legislature is ensured by the fact that&#13;
there is a tradition of backbencbers bring the Government to books. Parliament&#13;
is powerfl because there are sufficient members whose political reputations&#13;
depend upon their ability and willingness to champion causcs even at the risk&#13;
of falling foul of their own party when it forms the government. No such&#13;
tradition exists in Jamaica. The Executive dominatcs the Legislature and in a&#13;
real sense the practice of 'parliamentary democracy in Jamaica is in the form&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANN]R 9 124&#13;
13&#13;
of 'cabinct government' resulting from the fact that what has been copied is not&#13;
the 'Westminster model' but a form of cabinet govemment in which the&#13;
legislaturc has become dominated by the Executive and in which legislators&#13;
themselves are embroiled in administrative finctions."&#13;
25.  Jamaica faces a number of issues that will have to be addressed in the ongoing&#13;
discussions that arc taing place on constitutional refonm. While that process&#13;
moves to a state of fruition it is noted that the United Kingdom and New&#13;
Zealand share much in common with Jamaica's political and administrative&#13;
culture which can guide our transfomation to an efficient results-oriented&#13;
system of public administration. Both expenrences have cmerged over many&#13;
years of change and both have takcn place within the context of specific laws&#13;
that were enacted to drive the processcs of change forward. Jamaica does not&#13;
have the time to allow the process to evolve slowly and it has no alternative but&#13;
to enact the laws, that will create the framework within our constitution, for&#13;
radical change.&#13;
SOME PRE REQUISITES FOR THE NEW SYSTEM&#13;
26.  Tlbere are a number of political assumnptions that wiU have to be accepted and&#13;
.also enshrined in the enabling legislation that will govem decentralization&#13;
"The Economist 7 October. 1995 page 52. Jamaica New Politrics ? " What Jamaica calls&#13;
Vtc westmninster system' bears little rclation tn its namesake. With no effective local&#13;
govcrrunent and rtot much of a civil service cither. members of parliament are responsible for&#13;
everything from disaster relief to road-building.' (Author's note: This view was not illustrated&#13;
but it demonstrates a view of the Jamaican political system which has gained wide support.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 9 125&#13;
14&#13;
through the introduction of Executive agencies.&#13;
27.  First and forcmost. the Minister must remain accountable to Parliament for the&#13;
agency which will be made into an exectutive agency. The Minister must also&#13;
be accountable for the core department that remains a part of the Civil Service&#13;
establishment under the ministry for which he or she has portfolio&#13;
responsibility. This must be clcarly set out in enabling statute and it must be&#13;
clear that it overrides all statutes that establish any statutory authority. For&#13;
example, if it were decided to make the Water Commission or the National&#13;
Insurance Scheme into an executive agency the should be no doubt that the&#13;
respective ministers remain accoTntable to Parliament. Thc creation of&#13;
executive agencies must not create a shield behind which the ulnmatc executive&#13;
responsibility at the Cabinet level can be hidden and a statute should spell out&#13;
the minimuri standards for accounting. ;&#13;
28.. The statutes should also set out clearly the nature of the accountability of the&#13;
Chief Executive officer in terms that will not blur that responsibility with&#13;
ministerial accountability. There should be no doubt that the reforms are&#13;
centered on the objectives of accountability, greater effciency and transparency&#13;
-in the use of public funds. There must be standards by which the public can&#13;
measure the performance of the agencies and assess whether the quality of the&#13;
services that are delivered is compatible with the provision of value for money.&#13;
29.  Another area that will require spccific trcatment will be the demarcation of the&#13;
relationships of the Minister, the Civil Service department and the executive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
15G&#13;
agcncy. This will require clear definition of the stucture with'in which the&#13;
ministcr monitors the rnanagement of the agency, the obligation of the Minister&#13;
to publish the outputs against which he will measure the agency's performance&#13;
and the publication of the framework agreement through which a CEO&#13;
undertakes to manage the agency in ptirsuiit of the stated outputs.&#13;
30.  In this connmction the statute will have to spell out the level of autonomy that&#13;
CEOs will enjoy and will havc to recognize the professionalism of the Civil&#13;
Service. it is arguable that details of this kind should be excluded from statute&#13;
law and should bc left to the framcwork agreements that will be signed between&#13;
the mini5tcrs and the CEOs. The difficulty with this approach is that it come&#13;
against the background of a Civil service that has yielded its obligation and&#13;
right to defer from Ministers on adcninistrative matters and we are operating in&#13;
the context of an environment in which the demarcation between policy and&#13;
executive function have become blurred  In addition the Government would&#13;
have to cstablish some professional machinery to ensure that the faramework&#13;
axeernents clearly state the following:&#13;
(a) what the tasks of the Executive agency are.&#13;
(b) the outputs against which the pcrformance of the agency will be&#13;
assessed&#13;
(c) the indicators of changc that will be uscd to assess whether in&#13;
addition to achieving the targeted ouitputs thc service to the public has&#13;
improved; for example the extent to which the public is getting value for&#13;

THE POLITICS OF TRANSFORMA rFION&#13;
31.   Tlicrc are a number of othcr considerations for which no legislative standards&#13;
can be established but which nouethclcss will require attention to ensure that&#13;
the accountability of Ministers aid agencies to Parliament does not become the&#13;
kind of process that the Public Accoults Comunittce has become. Systems will&#13;
hiave to be established that will ensure that, the targets having been set between&#13;
the Minister and the CEO, and having been embodied in a quasi legal contract,&#13;
the performance of the agencies and the monitoring process by the Minister is&#13;
open to public scrutiny This among other things will require that a special&#13;
Parliamentary Conrumittee with the requisite expertise is cstablished and that&#13;
therc are managerial systems that will tell that committee and Parliament what&#13;
is happening, not merelv with the peripheral Issues buit more so with regard to&#13;
the big issues that impact on the public on a day to day basis.&#13;
32.   There are other rcasons why the approach of ' minor amendments' to the&#13;
existing Financial Administration and Audit Act and the Civil Service&#13;
Establishmcnt Act are undesirable. The reforms will only be credible if they&#13;
enjoy the enthusiastic support of the senior ministers of government, including&#13;
'In the U.K the introduction of executive agencies has been accompanied by an incrcase&#13;
in the cxternal auditing of thc se agencies This auditing has to go beyond financial auditing in&#13;
order to ensure that thc objcctive of producing better se.vice to the public is achieved and has&#13;
included quality auditing, analysc5 of manage ment overheads across different agencies, process&#13;

THE PILOT PROJECTS&#13;
37.   Four agencies have been chosen as pilot projects, viz; The Registrar of&#13;
Copn i'es, The Registrar of Births and Deaths, The Registrar of Titles and the&#13;
Customs Departmcnt.. E;ach one of these agencies operates under its own&#13;
statute. For easy reference I will examine the Companies Registry and the&#13;
Registrar General's Office.&#13;
38    The Registration (Births and Deaths) Act, which was enacted in 1881, provides&#13;
for the Govenor-General to appoint "a fit person" to be Reg'strar of Births and&#13;
deaths in Jamaica. This person holds office during the Governor-General's&#13;
.: plcasure and is removable by him." The Registrar of Rilrth% and Deaths is also&#13;

ANNEX 9  131&#13;
20&#13;
(Births and Dcaths) Act the Governor-General appoints a] of tilc staff The&#13;
legal basis for creating an cxecutive agency is therefore already in existence.&#13;
39.   i thie case of the Companies Registry, the office of Registrar of Comparuies is&#13;
a public officc3and appointments to this office are in the authority of the Public&#13;
Service Commission under the Constitution.&#13;
i&#13;
40.  In practice thcrc is no distinction between the authority for the appointment of&#13;
the two offices and thc distinction is related to the fact that the Companies Act&#13;
is a post-independence statute which complies with the lettr of the&#13;
Constitution and Registration (Births and Deaths) Act was enacted within the&#13;
norms of the structure of Government that existed when the Govemor had the&#13;
powers which now vest in the Public Service Connssion.&#13;
REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES AND PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT&#13;
41.  The Governor-Ccneral hms authority under Scction 127 of the Constitution to&#13;
delegate the functions of the Public Service Comrission over the appointment&#13;
transfer and discipline of public servants. This power should be evoked in&#13;
respect to the staff of the Office of the Registrar of Companies anid the&#13;
Registar Gencral and delcegated the holders of the posts of Registrar. Separate&#13;
I lcgal instrunicts  should be used which are tailored to the particular&#13;
circumstances of each agency.&#13;

42.   The instruments should set out the standards of good employrneiit practices&#13;
that the CEO will be required to practice, and establish the procedures for&#13;
discipline that will be followed under the delegated atithonty. These standards&#13;
and practices should conform to enlightcned and modern standards and must&#13;
enable the CEO to effectively take responsibility for the efficient management&#13;
of the personiel under her control&#13;
43.  Thcre will be thc problem of the rights of existing staff who enjoy the nrghts&#13;
that civil servants have under Constitution   The Government muLst take a&#13;
number of polic;y decisions abotit hiow they will approach this problem. It is&#13;
faced with its obligation to uphold thc Constitution. It is also faced with its&#13;
obligation to deliver eficient, cost-effective and courteous service to the public.&#13;
In pursuit of thesc objectives it must decide whether it is going to dis-establish&#13;
the entire offices of the two Registries except for the Chief Executive Officers&#13;
or creatc the mechanism for seconding staff in and oUt nf the two offices as the&#13;
need arises.&#13;
44    Tie later course is faced with the anomaly that employees within the registries&#13;
will bc under a diffcrent set of terms of employment than exists under their&#13;
substantive cngagements as Civil Scrvants. A great deal depends on the speed&#13;
with which the transformation is undertaken, the level of commitment that is&#13;
. generated for the new system within the particular departments and the Civil&#13;
Service as a whole, the extent to which the labour movement, the political&#13;
establishment and the public at large arc recruited as active supporters of the&#13;
modernization and the assessment of the timing for the enactment of&#13;

THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
45.  The delegabon of financial management to the Registrar of Companies and the&#13;
Registrar Gencral can be effcct'vely and ifficiently undertaken under the&#13;
Financial Administration and Audit Act. As in the case of the delegation of&#13;
personncl finctions each delegation should be undertaken by a separate&#13;
instrument that is specially tailored to meet the requirements of the particular&#13;
agency.  Tiis is not only required to easure that the delegation meets the&#13;
differing dictates of good order that are indicated by the nature of the activities&#13;
that each undertakes. but also because the statutes that establish each agency&#13;
deals with revenue in specific ways.&#13;
46.  In the case of the Companies Act Section 334 reqcuires that all fees shall be paid&#13;
into the Consolidated Fund. This includes the fees payable vunlder the. Ninth&#13;
Schedule which makes provision for a variety of fees for several categories of&#13;
business activities that are regtilated by the Act. Similarly the other statutes&#13;
that arc administered by the Registrar. including the Business Names Act, the&#13;
Industrial and Provident Societies Act, the Trade Marks Act and the Designs&#13;
sand Patents Acts, have their fees set out in schedules that require amendment&#13;
by Parliament. Since these are user fees and are not taxes the power to amend&#13;
them and keep thme in line with the costs of maintaining the services of the&#13;
Rcgistry should be delegated to the CEO and account taken of this in the&#13;

23&#13;
regulations for this registry uinder the Financial Administration and Audit Act.&#13;
47.  Section 50 of the Financial Administration and Audit Act gives the MiLnister&#13;
general powcrs to make regulations. It is proposed that appropriate regulations&#13;
specifically crafted to meet the objectives of creating an efficient Executive&#13;
Agcncy at the Registrar of Companies should be made under this section&#13;
embracing the power of the Financial Secretary to give directions to institutions&#13;
unidcr Section 51. Some of the specific instructions would address the sevcral&#13;
powers set out in the different sections of the Act.&#13;
48.  Section 7 dcals with revenues to be paid into the Consolidated Fund and&#13;
Section 8 with directions for the payment of fees penalties and unusual&#13;
receipts. Thc Minister of Finance has power to give special directions under&#13;
these sections and thc directions for the functioning of the Companies Registry&#13;
as an Executivc agency. should incorporate flexible but transparent procedures&#13;
that would enable the efficient finctioning of this agency.&#13;
49.  Sitnilarly the dircctions would provide expanded powers of virement under&#13;
Section 1 9A, power to make contracts for goods and services under Section&#13;
1 9B and flexiblc power over the custody and control of govermnent property.&#13;
which would includc the power to dispose of property which is no longer useful&#13;
to the agency&#13;
50.  Section 24A(3) of the Financia) Administration and Audit Act contains&#13;
provisions relating to the preparation and stubmission of Estimates of Revenue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANN EX 9   135&#13;
24&#13;
and Expenditure and the keeping of, among other things, accounts and records.&#13;
Section 24E deals with credit arrangements and Section 24F with standard&#13;
financial instructions. The comprehensive regulations under the Act, which&#13;
would cover the items which fall tmdeT the jurisdiction of the Financial&#13;
Secretary as well as those under the Minister's authority could address all of the&#13;
concerns that relate to maintaining accountability.&#13;
THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL&#13;
51.  The approach to the transformation of thic Reg'strar-General's OfFicc as a pilot&#13;
project should proceed along similar lines to that proposed for the Registrar of&#13;
Companies. This means that a separate delegation of personnel and financial&#13;
management directions should be tailorcd to meet the ex-agencies of that office&#13;
and the performnance environment in which it will operate and the targets that&#13;
will be set. There are some differences in the Registration (Births and Deaths)&#13;
Act which are worth noting. Section 9 contains provisions relating to payment&#13;
of fees of the Re 'strar-General into the Treasury. Tbc Act also contains&#13;
provisions for payment of salaries (Section 6), expenses for carrying out the&#13;
Act (Section 60), and Section 73 gives thc portfolio Minister power to alter the&#13;
appointed fces by Order This latter power can be delegated by the appropriate&#13;
legislative instrument to the Registrar-General.&#13;
52.  The portfolio Minister also has power under Section 8 of the Act to make&#13;
rcegulations for the government of the office. This power can also be delegated&#13;
to the Registrar-General by an appropriate legislative instrument.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 9 136&#13;
25&#13;
53;  It cannot be over-emphasized that the initiation of the pilot project. no less than&#13;
the introduction of the comprehensive framework for the transformation of the&#13;
public sector by introducing Executive Agencies, will depend openness anid&#13;
winning the support of the leadersbip and management cadre of the Civil&#13;
Scrvice, the labour movement, the political parties, the press and the&#13;
managemcnt organizations of the private sector. Unless significant leaders&#13;
own and promote thc concept in the context of a recognition that the public is&#13;
entitled to better standards of servicc and value for money, the pilot project will&#13;
not move smoothly and produce optimum results.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Public Sector
            Modernization Project for Jamaica is to support the
            governments' efforts to a) improve selected public
            agencies' service quality; b) improve the selected
            Ministries' ability to: formulate sector policies,
            technical standards and operational norms; effectively
            monitor and evaluate downstream agencies; and efficiently
            perform corporate management functions; c) continue public
            sector rationalization; d) improve efficiency, value for
            money and transparency in government procurement and
            contracting; e) enhance public financial and personnel
            management; and f) prepare the next stage of the
            modernization process. The project will consist of five
            components: a) modernization of public sector entities; b)
            privatization; c) government procurement, contracting,
            internal control and auditing; d) management information
            systems component; and e) project implementation,
