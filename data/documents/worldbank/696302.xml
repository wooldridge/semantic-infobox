IMPROVEMENT TO FINANCIAL REPORTING AND AUDITING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. THE SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Government Accounting and Audit&#13;
1.1         The Government of Pakistan's financial management cycle begins with planning&#13;
and programming and runs through budget formulation, budget execution, accounting, financial&#13;
control and audit/evaluation. The cycle is iterative; new plans are influenced by past results.&#13;
Reliable financial information is a key requirement for all phases.&#13;
1.2         The Constitution of Pakistan prescribes that all government expenditures, revenues,&#13;
loans and their repayments shall form part of provincial or federal consolidated funds and&#13;
withdrawals from the consolidated funds shall be regulated by law. The system of financial control&#13;
and budgeting is based on federallprovincial secretaries being designated as the principal&#13;
accounting officers of their respective departments, with the responsibility to ensure that funds&#13;
allotted to their departments are spent for authorized purposes and that expenditure is not incurred&#13;
in excess of budget allocations.&#13;
1.3         The Pakistan Audit Department (PAD) plays a key role in government financial&#13;
management. The functions of the Auditor General of Pakistan are defined in the Constitution of&#13;
Pakistan and regulated by statutory orders issued from time to time. The most recent of these is the&#13;
Pakistan Audit and Accounts Order 1973. Under this authority, PAD is responsible for keeping the&#13;
accounts of the federal and provincial governments, with the exception of certain departmentalized&#13;
accounts, defense, and railways. PAD is also responsible for audit of all expenditure and income of&#13;
the federal and provincial governments. As a crucial part of budget preparation and execution,&#13;
PAD prepares the accounting information which is used by executive agencies for planning and&#13;
programming purposes, and which forms part of the payments control process. PAD's audit&#13;
function maintains public accountability by auditing the accounts of government entities and&#13;
presenting audit findings to the legislature's Public Accounts Committee (PAC).&#13;
1.4         PAD's responsibility for accounting for both the Federation and the Provinces is&#13;
discharged through a network of offices under five Accountant Generals (AGs), one for each&#13;
province and the fifth, Accountant General Pakistan Revenues (AGPR), for the federal government,&#13;
with each office supported by District Accounts Offices (DAOs) and/or Treasury Offices which are&#13;
functionally responsible to it. The governments' accounts are prepared by PAD at the respective&#13;
AG's office located in each provincial capital, and by the AGPR in Islamabad for the Federation.&#13;
The accounts are based upon the primary financial transactions of payments and receipts which take&#13;
place at DAOs/Treasuries, the process being as follows. The executive agencies submit claims for&#13;
payment to the local DAO/Treasury, which authorizes payment by the local branch of the National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Bank of Pakistan, acting as the government's cashier. In case of receipts, the depositor is required&#13;
to deposit the amount in the bank/treasury. The bank sends a daily record to the local&#13;
DAO/Treasury which records the transactions. Transaction information, complied into accounts by&#13;
DAOs or in the form of individual transactions from Treasuries, is submitted to the AG, who&#13;
compiles an account of aggregate receipts and expenditures for reconciliation with departmental&#13;
records and government information.&#13;
1.5         PAD produces monthly and annual (Civil) accounts on the basis of information&#13;
received from the DAOs, Treasury offices, agencies with departmentalized accounts and inter-&#13;
government and inter-office adjustments. At the year end, annual appropriation accounts, annual&#13;
finance accounts and the combined finance and revenue accounts are prepared and supplied to the&#13;
federal and the provincial governments.&#13;
B. Status of Governments' Financial Reporting and Auditing&#13;
1.6         The government's fiscal reporting system and the institutional arrangements for&#13;
accounting and auditing were reviewed by a diagnostic consultancy financed under the Third&#13;
Technical Assistance Credit (Cr. 1755-PAK) to assess the adequacy of current institutional&#13;
arrangements, systems and procedures and to formulate a long term strategy for improvement. The&#13;
key findings of this study are:&#13;
a)    reports produced by the PAD do not meet the objectives of a fiscal reporting&#13;
system. Crucial financial information such as budget data and revenue collection&#13;
details are not reported. Financial information is fragmented between various&#13;
agencies and a reliable cohesive picture cannot be obtained. As a result the&#13;
reporting system does not provide government with an effective method to: (i)&#13;
monitor the fiscal deficit and its financing for aggregate control; (ii) manage its&#13;
cash and debt position; (iii) monitor expenditures in relation to appropriations; or,&#13;
(iv) provide analyses of spending and revenue trends to assist with policy&#13;
formulation and performance measurement;&#13;
b)    because of serious deficiencies in the financial systems, financial data for&#13;
financial planning, budgeting, reporting and control is unreliable. Financial&#13;
reports and final accounts, mostly based on manual accounting systems, are&#13;
neither timely, complete nor designed to meet user needs;&#13;
c)    PAD's audit function is viewed as a means of detecting irregularities and fraud&#13;
rather than as a management control function. The focus is to verify transactions&#13;
regardless of their value. Reviews of internal controls for system weaknesses are&#13;
norrnally not carried out. Audits have limited coverage due to lack of resources and&#13;
quality suffers due to a lack of expertise. Revenue audits do not have a major role&#13;
in PAD's audit function. Only a small proportion of Drawing and Disbursement&#13;
Officers are audited each year and purposeful parameters, such as potential risks or&#13;
weaknesses in internal controls, are not used as selection criteria for audits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3-&#13;
Certification audit has made little progress due to the volume of transactions and&#13;
lack of expertise within PAD. In the absence of auditing standards and quality&#13;
assurance, the quality of audit work is low;&#13;
d)    PAD, the Supreme Audit Institution of Pakistan, is compromised due to the&#13;
agency's dual responsibility of maintaining the accounts of entities and being&#13;
responsible for their audit. Separation of the accounting and auditing functions&#13;
within government is viewed as a primary requirement for establishing the&#13;
independence and credibility of audit; and&#13;
e)   the existing human resource management functions in PAD are limited in scope.&#13;
Personnel at the accounts offices are frequently not adequately qualified or&#13;
trained. The effectiveness of training programs is undermined by lack of&#13;
application of training.&#13;
1.7         The absence of accurate, comprehensive and timely financial information in&#13;
Pakistan's federal and provincial governments hampers efforts to improve resource allocation,&#13;
monitoring and control of expenditure, cash flow and debt management, and casts uncertainty on&#13;
the financial data underpinning public sector management decisions and the macro economic&#13;
dialogue.&#13;
1.8         As major internal financial controls are not functioning, governance, based upon&#13;
accountability for use of resources, is being undermined. The accounting weaknesses further&#13;
limit the usefulness of audit, in addition to the technical shortcomings noted above.&#13;
C. Government's Strategy&#13;
1.9         Vision Statement The Government of Pakistan recognizes that as it proceeds to&#13;
open up its economy and free it from regulatory controls, the need for modern financial&#13;
management systems and good governance becomes paramount. Instead of direct intervention it&#13;
has to design appropriate fiscal and monetary responses to changing conditions. To be able to do&#13;
so, the government recognizes the need for a modern set of tools to provide it with comprehensive,&#13;
accurate and timely financial information. As government strives to attract private foreign&#13;
investment the issues of transparency and accountability become even more important in the&#13;
context of a global economy. Agreeing with the thrust of the recommendations of the diagnostic&#13;
consultancy, the govemment has developed an overall vision statement for financial reporting and&#13;
auditing (see Annex 2) stating its intention to:&#13;
a)    adopt and implement a modern accounting system designed according to recognized&#13;
accounting principles and standards and based on modern information technology;&#13;
b)   implement a governance structure and legal framework for an independent and&#13;
effective audit function;&#13;
c)   improve the professional capacity of the elements of the civil service responsible for&#13;
fiscal management;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
d)    make increasing use of the private sector to supplement public sector resources; and&#13;
e)    adopt improved standards for private sector financial disclosure.&#13;
1.10        The redefinition of public/private roles which forms a core element of Pakistan's&#13;
structural reform program requires a diminished public sector involvement in productive&#13;
activities but imposes increased demands on the government for economic policy coordination&#13;
and economic information. However, the current capacity of the Ministry of Finance and the&#13;
Planning Commission to prepare medium-to-longer term policy options on key development&#13;
finance issues and to monitor the implementation of related reforms is weak and requires&#13;
strengthening. In particular, improved skills and policy formulation capacity are needed to:&#13;
a)    manage an increasingly open economy in the face of large capital inflows and&#13;
outflows;&#13;
b)   implement policies to improve and make more competitive the enabling&#13;
environment for the private sector; and&#13;
c)    develop more efficient resource allocation and expenditure utilization structures&#13;
required for the expansion of basic social services.&#13;
1.11        In this connection, the government will need to follow through on the&#13;
implementation of the recommendations of the 1993 Economy Commission on the&#13;
administrative restructuring and organization of the Federal Secretariat. MOF and the Planning&#13;
Commission -- which are the primary users of the financial information prepared by PAD -- have&#13;
requested assistance to strengthen their analytical and policy formulation capacity in these and&#13;
other areas of macroeconomic management.&#13;
1.12        Policy Changes To address problems in accounting and auditing described above,&#13;
the government has agreed to introduce policy changes relating to:&#13;
a)    adoption of improved accounting principles and standards for the government&#13;
sector;&#13;
b)    a phased transfer of responsibilities for government accounting from the Auditor&#13;
General to the executive arm of government;&#13;
c)    enhanced independence, standards and capacity for government audit, including&#13;
greater use of private sector firms in public sector finance; and,&#13;
d)    development of the skills and competencies of government finance staff, including&#13;
revised human resource management and training policies.&#13;
1.13        Government has requested IDA's assistance to implement these strategies, which&#13;
it is considered would require a sequence of projects. This project would address standards for&#13;
accounting and auditing, design improved systems and start implementation of selected&#13;
improvements (with greater initial emphasis on accounting), strengthen capacity, initiate&#13;
institutional changes, such as the phased transfer of accounting responsibilities to the executive arm&#13;
of government, and identify further strengthening of financial management, particularly with regard&#13;
to audit. The project will provide a basis for improvements in governance and accountability.&#13;
Private sector firms have been consulted during the design of this project, and the project includes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assistance to increase further private sector participation in public finance. Subject to satisfactory&#13;
performance, subsequent projects would, in conjunction with the executive agency created for&#13;
government accounting, complete the replication of accounting systems across all accounting&#13;
offices, and with the restructured Audit Department help to address matters to further enhance&#13;
capacity and independence which need to be handled over the longer term, providing tools for&#13;
further enhancing governance. In all, about a 10 to 15 year period of involvement in improving&#13;
financial management is envisaged.&#13;
D. Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement&#13;
1.14         IDA's past experience with similar projects demonstrates the need for:&#13;
a)    a high level of commitment on the part of the member country to project objectives;&#13;
b)    well defined objectives, consistent with the country's absorptive capacity;&#13;
c)    thorough preparation and accurate assessment of needs; and&#13;
d)    rigorous supervision.&#13;
1.15         IDA's previous experience of PAD is limited to project audit, and PAD's&#13;
component of the Third Technical Assistance Credit (Cr.1755-PAK) which had four sub-&#13;
components:&#13;
a)    computerization of accounting and payroll procedures through automation of&#13;
existing procedures;&#13;
b)    enhancing research and development capabilities of the Department, including&#13;
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the existing system of fiscal reporting;&#13;
c)    reviewing and improving the Department's training arrangements and facilities;&#13;
and&#13;
d)    preparing a development program for the next phase.&#13;
1.16         Experience gained in this project highlights the necessity of setting up appropriate&#13;
mechanisms for involving and obtaining agreement from federal and provincial government at an&#13;
early stage of the project. Project management requirements include setting up clearly defined&#13;
project management structures, for proper planning in the use and development of new&#13;
application software, and for developing appropriate performance indicators to judge&#13;
effectiveness. Training programs need clear statements of objectives and benefits of training,&#13;
local participation in course development, appropriate procedures for selecting trainees and&#13;
deploying trained staff, training for senior officers, and use of in-country courses where&#13;
appropriate since foreign training is expensive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

I. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin and Borrower Ownership&#13;
2.1         The project is based upon diagnostic analysis undertaken by PAD of the status of&#13;
government accounting and audit, which resulted in the preparation of the strategies underpinning&#13;
the project. Internal ownership of the project is strengthened as the project would build on PAD's&#13;
own computerization initiatives and training undertaken prior to and as part of the Third Technical&#13;
Assistance Project (Cr. 1755-PAK). The project concept has been widely discussed within PAD, to&#13;
inform departmental staff of the objectives of change and the opportunities generated thereof. PAD&#13;
has developed external ownership within the government, through discussions with and&#13;
involvement of the main users of financial reports and information, the major intended beneficiaries&#13;
of the improved accounting systems and financial reporting. The relevant agencies concerned with&#13;
HRM, particularly the Establishment Division and the Federal Public Services Commission have&#13;
also been consulted about project design. A Committee has been established comprising the key&#13;
federal and provincial government users of financial information, to advise on the improvements to&#13;
financial systems and to monitor implementation.&#13;
.R Objectives&#13;
2.2         The overall objectives of the project are:&#13;
a)   to improve public sector accounting and financial systems;&#13;
b)   to provide the basis for enhancing public sector accountability; and&#13;
c)   to support improved institutional capacity for economic policy-making and&#13;
management.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
2.3         The project would comprise components for public sector financial management&#13;
including accounting, auditing and institutional development, economic policy-making and&#13;
management.&#13;
2.4         GovernMent Accounting and Financisl Reporting (base cost USS 12.3&#13;
millio) The government wishes to develop accounting standards, reporting systems and&#13;
financial administration procedures conforming as far as practicable to internationally accepted&#13;
principles. In view of the very high and continuously increasing volume of financial transactions,&#13;
a completely manual recording and processing system for PAD's accounting and auditing needs&#13;
is no longer feasible for the delivery of the type of information required for financial&#13;
management. Therefore, the adoption of some degree of automation is inevitable. Properly&#13;
designed computer based systems would, in addition to managing the processing of a large&#13;
number of transactions and the corresponding information retrieval needs, efficiently, also help&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
ensure that controls prescribed for financial transactions are adhered to, thereby improving the&#13;
effectiveness of public expenditure management processes. Accordingly, PAD wishes to&#13;
implement a set of high priority computer based financial application systems. The project&#13;
includes consultancy assistance to define a modem set of accounting standards, for&#13;
implementation of the improved standards, and computer hardware, software, consultancies and&#13;
training required for the design, development and implementation of the following high priority&#13;
financial systems at about 21 of the total 95 sites:&#13;
a)    Core Accounting and Reporting System: This system would provide integrated&#13;
government-wide accounting, encompassing the functional requirements for&#13;
budget execution, and covering the appropriation, commitment, funds allocation,&#13;
and payment processes for investment and current budgets.&#13;
The system would be comprehensive in terms of coverage and provide a credible&#13;
source of reliable and timely data. Accordingly, the Core Accounting System&#13;
would be fully automated, interfacing with external data sources, such as external&#13;
debt, on a periodic basis. This system, introduced along with a modem budget&#13;
classification system and an appropriate chart of accounts, would enable&#13;
expenditures and revenues to be recorded at a detailed level and related to specific&#13;
programs and projects. The data would be amenable to cross classification for&#13;
financial and economic analyses.&#13;
It would be used by: (i) PAD (including its subordinate units and its successor&#13;
organization) to perform the basic accounting functions; (ii) the federal MOF and&#13;
the provincial Finance Departnents to perform the processes associated with budget&#13;
execution, monitoring and control; implement cash limits, as may be required; (iv)&#13;
the federal Planning Division and the provincial Planning Departnents to obtain the&#13;
status of actual expenditures on ongoing programs and projects. Data would also be&#13;
directly available for use by agencies/spending units for program and project&#13;
management.&#13;
b)    Payroll and Pension Systems: The payroll of government employees constitutes&#13;
a large portion of government expenditures. The need for an automated payroll&#13;
and pension system is evident in view of the increasing volume of transactions.&#13;
The proposed system would perform the full range of the payroll functions, and&#13;
the expenditures processed would automatically update the core accounting and&#13;
reporting system.&#13;
c)    Cash Flow Forecasting and Financial Analysis System: One of the MOF's&#13;
main information needs is to establish a system for forecasting likely flows of&#13;
payments and receipts, and the consequent impact on cash balances and issue of&#13;
debt instruments. The cash flow and financial analysis system would be designed&#13;
to meet this requirement. It would provide a powerful facility for retrieving&#13;
current and historical data from the accounting system, and it would allow end-&#13;
users to manipulate the data for forecasting and analysis purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
2.5         A more detailed description of the information systems, their scope in terms of the&#13;
functional processes and agencies they cover, how they fit in the context of the overall&#13;
information systems architecture for fiscal management in Pakistan, and a description of the&#13;
proposed technology architecture, is given in Annex 4 and shown schematically in Figure 1 in&#13;
the Annex.&#13;
2.6         A study would also be made to assess the impact to date of departmentalized&#13;
accounting, and to recommend future strategy options. PAD would also, within its existing&#13;
resources, establish as needed continuous review of government rules and regulations to:&#13;
a)   identify changes required to bring the rules up to date;&#13;
b)   implement recommendations in audit reports; and&#13;
c)   reflect changes in systems and procedures.&#13;
2.7         Government Auditing (base cost US$ 6.6 million) This component focuses on&#13;
audit systems improvement and systems development. It includes:&#13;
a)    Audit Standards and Techniques: Consultant services to prepare guidelines for&#13;
the introduction of international auditing standards, to introduce modem auditing&#13;
techniques and concepts, to review PAD's audit policies, processes and&#13;
procedures, output, workload, efficiency and quality assurance for the audit&#13;
function, to advise on methodologies to enhance PAD's communications with&#13;
stake holders, for internal audit of PAD's systems under development, to assist in&#13;
the use of automated audit tools and standard audit programs wherever&#13;
appropriate, to improve communication of audit results and to develop quality&#13;
assurance programs.&#13;
b)    Automated Tools: Provision of hardware and audit software for audit planning,&#13;
sampling and documentation, and for audit of automated accounting systems.&#13;
c)    Capacity Development: Consultancy to support revised human resource&#13;
management procedures through international training in a modem financial&#13;
system environment and through arranging attachments with other Supreme Audit&#13;
Institutions.&#13;
d)    Use of Private Sector Firms: Assistance with developing modalities for utilizing&#13;
private sector firms, and finance for private audit firms' fees.&#13;
2.8         Institutional Development To sustain the above improvements to financial&#13;
management systems, the project would assist in the introduction of revised human resource&#13;
management policies, the strengthening of financial management training, the development of a&#13;
Management Information Systems (MIS) wing of PAD, introduction of office automation to&#13;
assist in the performance of day to day work, and put in place project management structures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
a)    Human Resource Management (HRM) (base cost US$ 1.3 million): The&#13;
HRM component would involve organizational and systems development.&#13;
Although PAD would implement most components without external support, the&#13;
project would provide consultant assistance for managing the process of change,&#13;
for preparation of job descriptions and performance standards, and for installing&#13;
an MIS system for HRM planning and monitoring. PAD would share the details&#13;
and results of its HRM policies with provinces and the Establishment Division.&#13;
b)    Training (base cost US$ 6.0 million): The training component includes moving&#13;
towards professional-level training, providing retraining associated with the&#13;
changes introduced by the project, strengthening the quality of training and&#13;
training facilities, and expanding the circle of beneficiaries. The project would&#13;
provide refurbishment and some extension of existing facilities, equipment,&#13;
computer hardware, materials, and consultants to assist in training needs&#13;
assessments, course design, materials development and training of trainers. The&#13;
component would also include international scholarships for faculty trainers, and&#13;
seminars. In addition to including provincial staff in its training programs, PAD&#13;
would share training course materials with provincial training institutes as&#13;
appropriate. A detailed training plan is attached at Annex 5.&#13;
c)    Administration (base cost US$ 6.3 million): The project would include&#13;
administrative capacity development as follows:&#13;
i. MIS Wing: The project would support the creation of an MIS Wing and&#13;
would provide for the following:&#13;
*  a Software Development Center;&#13;
*  selected posts to be staffed by contract professionals (such as the&#13;
General Manager (MIS) and other technical specialists);&#13;
*  local training for PAD staff in systems development; and,&#13;
*  recurrent costs for systems maintenance.&#13;
ii. Project Management: Strengthening the Project Directorate, through&#13;
provision of staff, facilities, hardware and software, consultants and training.&#13;
Assistance would also be provided for technical review of computerized&#13;
information systems' development, and for a senior level advisory panel of&#13;
international experts, which would at least meet annually.&#13;
iii. Future Project Preparation: Assistance for preparation of the follow-up&#13;
project if grant funds are not available.&#13;
iv. Office Automation: Provision for a local area network and associated office&#13;
software for PAD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
2.9         Other Policy Support for Economic Management (base cost US$ 1.7 million)&#13;
MOF and the Planning Commission would manage selected studies on economic and financial&#13;
policy issues related to the on-going macroeconomic and structural reform program, a diagnostic&#13;
study of the institutional arrangements for macroeconomic policy-making, and technical&#13;
assistance/training to upgrade staff skills. Specific areas include international capital markets,&#13;
foreign asset/liability management, improving the revenue yield of certain taxes, on-the-job&#13;
specialized training in macro modeling, and assistance for establishment of a nucleus in the&#13;
Planning Commission for analyzing and monitoring poverty. The project would finance the&#13;
costs of (mostly local) consultancy services required for the studies and short-term technical&#13;
assistance for staff training. Terms of reference for key studies would be completed prior to&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
D. Performance Monitoring Indicators&#13;
2.10        To measure implementation performance, and to monitor the project's impact, the&#13;
following key indicators, discussed and agreed with government, would be selected from the&#13;
project's implementation plan (Annex 6) and milestones and performance indicators (Annex 8):&#13;
a)    Implementation Performance&#13;
i)   revised accounting standards adopted by May 1997;&#13;
ii)   pilot implementation of core financial systems completed by&#13;
December 1999;&#13;
iii)   province-wide replication of core financial systems completed by&#13;
December 200 1;&#13;
iv)   identification of public/private audit cooperation opportunities by&#13;
December 1997;&#13;
v)   introduction of Accounting Technicians and 2 year Probationers'&#13;
training by April 1998 and January 1999, respectively; and&#13;
vi)   approval of proposals for functional separation of accounting and audit by&#13;
December 1999.&#13;
b)    Outcome and Impact&#13;
i)   improved financial reports including budget, variance and project costs;&#13;
ii)   percentage of transactions automated, by value;&#13;
iii)   cash-flow forecasts introduced and efficiency of borrowing improved;&#13;
iv)   PAD staffs job rotation within 3 years reduced;&#13;
v)    more timely reports to Public Accounts Committees; and&#13;
vi)  improved training impact evaluation results.&#13;
&#13;

E. IDA's Strategy&#13;
2.11        The proposed project is consistent with IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
discussed on December 15, 1995. The CAS stresses the centrality of fiscal adjustment to&#13;
Pakistan's reform and development efforts. Addressing these concerns involves, inter alia,&#13;
improved resource mobilization, public expenditure reform, more effective use of government&#13;
resources, and improved public sector management. The project would focus on developing&#13;
more effective financial accounting, reporting, control and monitoring systems, and would&#13;
therefore provide an essential support for these activities. The policy support component would&#13;
assist achieve CAS objectives by contributing to improvements in macroeconomic management.&#13;
2.12         The CAS, in support of the establishment of a more competitive enabling&#13;
environment, also seeks to improve governance in Pakistan. The proposed emphasis on improved&#13;
accounting and financial reporting will have a direct impact in this regard. Sound accounting is the&#13;
first line of good governance. Governance would also be assisted by the improved transparency of&#13;
the linkages between budgeting, internal controls and accountability resulting from the new&#13;
systems, and the improved financial systems would help ensure the routine application of all&#13;
prescribed controls on financial transactions. In the longer term, the measures to enhance the&#13;
auditor's independence and strengthen audit capacity would also contribute to improved&#13;
governance.&#13;
2.13        IDA's involvement would build upon its existing dialogues with PAD, relating to&#13;
project audit and the preparation of this project. The proposed project complements and reinforces&#13;
Bank group operations such as the Sindh Special Development Project (Cr. 2558-PAK) which&#13;
assists Government of Sindh's efforts to reform provincial policies and programs. The project&#13;
would also support government's effort to seek greater involvement of private sector firms in&#13;
government financial management. IDA is well placed to provide assistance because of its&#13;
continuing dialogue with government on fiscal adjustment, its involvement with executive&#13;
departments of both federal and provincial government, and its ability to provide, subject to&#13;
satisfactory performance, longer termn support to undertake subsequent stages of reform.&#13;
F. Environment&#13;
2.14        There are no environmental problems anticipated for this project, which has&#13;
received a C rating under the IDA's Environmental Assessment Operational Guidelines.&#13;
G. PoJect Cost and Fa&#13;
2.15        The total cost of the proposed project, including physical and price contingencies, is&#13;
estimated at US$ 37.2 million equivalent, of which taxes and duties amount to US$1.8 million&#13;
equivalent. Summary estimates are given in Table 2.1 and detailed estimates are given in Annex 1.&#13;
Full details are contained in the project file. The foreign exchange component is estimated at&#13;
US$17.1 million equivalent or 46% of total project costs.&#13;

2.16           The base cost estimates reflect price levels in March 1996. Estimates for materials,&#13;
equipment, vehicles and technical assistance have been based on recent quotations from suppliers,&#13;
market surveys of manufacturers, and contracts. Physical contingencies of 5% on computer&#13;
hardware and purchased software, and 10% on software development services have been allowed.&#13;
Price contingencies and foreign exchange conversions have been calculated in accordance with&#13;
Bank guidelines, using World Bank estimates prevailing at the time of appraisal. Foreign inflation&#13;
rates are estimated as 3.6% for the calendar year 1996, and about 2.4% annually thereafter.&#13;
Domestic annual inflation is estimated to be 12% for calendar year 1995 and 7.5% annually&#13;
thereafter. No price contingencies have been included for hardware. Price contingencies amount to&#13;
5.4% of the total estimated project cost. Estimated exchange rate parities between US dollars and&#13;
Pakistan Rupees result in an average Rs. 40.4 per US dollar over the course of the project.&#13;
2.17          The proposed IDA credit of US$28.8 million equivalent would finance about 77%&#13;
of project costs, covering 100% of foreign exchange and 56 % of local currency requirements.&#13;
Federal govemment (23 %) would finance the balance. The government's contribution would&#13;
include finance for duties, taxes, and recurrent costs, including incremental staff salaries,&#13;
maintenance, consumables and other recurrent costs. The project financing plan is summarized in&#13;
Table 2.2 below.&#13;

Commission and US$1.2 million equivalent to MOF through normal budgetary procedures.&#13;
H. Procurement&#13;
2.19          Procurement of goods and civil works would be carried out in accordance with&#13;
World Bank procurement guidelines, with arrangements as indicated in Table 4.1 below.&#13;
2.20          Works: Procurement of civil works for site preparation at the 12 sites where&#13;
computer systems would be installed and renovation of training facilities would be in accordance&#13;
with national competitive procedures acceptable to IDA. The estimated cost of civil works for&#13;
site preparation and renovation is US$ 0.9 million equivalent inclusive of contingencies with&#13;
individual contracts under US$ 100,000 equivalent. The small scattered nature of the work&#13;
would limit the interests of foreign bidders. Existing procurement procedures of the&#13;
implementing agency have been reviewed to ensure adequate competition and encourage&#13;
economy and efficiency.&#13;
2.21          Goods: The estimated cost of goods (mainly computer hardware and software,&#13;
office furniture and equipment, and vehicles) is US$10.0 million inclusive of contingencies.&#13;
Procurement of the main computer systems would be in accordance with IDA's procurement&#13;
guidelines. A total of 12 computer systems are to be procured for accounting and financial&#13;
reporting; one system for the Software Development Center, and the remaining 11 for accounting&#13;
offices nationwide. The computer system required for systems development and testing at the&#13;
Software Development Center, about two years prior to the main procurement, would be&#13;
procured as a separate item following national competitive bidding procedures (NCB). The&#13;
technical specification for this system would be based on UNIX and OPEN system standards,&#13;
thereby not pre-determining the procurement of the remaining 11 systems. These will be&#13;
packaged as a single international competitive bidding (ICB) procurement, with phased delivery&#13;
of equipment. Other contracts over US$ 100,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of&#13;
ICB, including the procurement of vehicles and equipment. Local suppliers and manufacturers&#13;
competing for the supply of goods under ICB would be granted a margin of preference of 15% of&#13;
the CIF bid price for locally manufactured goods or the applicable custom duties and taxes-&#13;
whichever is lower-during bid evaluation. Other procurement of vehicles and equipment in&#13;
contracts of less than US$ 100,000 equivalent would be carried out under NCB procedures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
aggregating not more than US$ 2.8 million. Minor items including office furniture and&#13;
equipment, personal computers, vehicles and items in small quantities which would not attract&#13;
the interest of foreign suppliers, would be procured through local shopping obtaining price&#13;
quotations from not less than three suppliers, in packages not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent,&#13;
and not exceeding US$ 0.3 million equivalent in aggregate.&#13;

2.22         Consultancies. Incremental Staff and Operating Costs: The estimated cost of&#13;
service contracts, consultants and training is US$19.8 million equivalent. Consultancies&#13;
incorporating substantial international expertise include: development of accounting standards,&#13;
financial systems design and implementation (base costs US$ 3.7 million); assistance to strengthen&#13;
audit (base costs US$ 1.5 million); development of training and training materials (base costs US$&#13;
0.6 million); and change management assistance for HRM (base costs US$ 0.3 million).&#13;
Consultancies and service contracts incorporating mostly national expertise include: financial&#13;
systems software coding (base costs US$ 1.7 million); fees for private sector audit firms (base costs&#13;
US$ 2.0 million); economic management studies (base costs US$ 1.1 million); assistance to the&#13;
Planning Commission (base costs US$ 0.6 million); and assistance to replicate systems&#13;
implementation (base costs US$ 0.6 million). Training courses and attachments include&#13;
international training in financial management/MBAs (base costs US$ 1.0 million) and attachments&#13;
with SAIs (base costs US$ 0.5 million). Technical training of computer staff (base costs US$ 0.5&#13;
million) and seminars and conferences (base costs US$ 0.1 million) would be mainly national.&#13;
Consulting services would be procured in accordance with The World Bank Guidelines for Use of&#13;
Consultants. Incremental staff and operating costs would be financed by government.&#13;
2.23         Contract Review. All individual contracts for civil works and goods estimated to&#13;
cost the equivalent of US$ 100,000 or more and contracts for the employment of consulting firms&#13;
estimated to cost US$ 100,000 equivalent each or more and contracts for the employment of&#13;
individuals estimated to cost US$ 50,000 equivalent each or more would be subject to IDA's prior&#13;
review and approval. For consultants contracts below these thresholds, prior review would be&#13;
required of: (a) terms of reference; (b) single source selection of firms; (c) assignments of a critical&#13;
nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank; (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of&#13;
consulting firms or individuals that would raise the contract values to these thresholds. It is&#13;
estimated that 70% of the contracts for civil works and goods would be subject to prior review.&#13;
Post review would be undertaken of the remainder on a random basis.&#13;
I. Disbursement&#13;
2.24         The IDA Credit would be disbursed over a period of five years and would finance&#13;
about 77% per cent of the cost of the project. The proceeds of the Credit would be disbursed&#13;
against eligible expenditures, net of taxes and duties, as indicated in Table 4.2 below. The&#13;
estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 7.&#13;
2.25         Disbursements would be fully documented except those for expenditures: (a) under&#13;
contracts not exceeding the equivalent of: (i) US$ 100,000 each for goods and civil works, (ii)&#13;
US$ 100,000 for the services of consulting firms, and (iii) $50,000 for the services of individual&#13;
consultants; and, (b) for training. Such disbursements would be made against Statements of&#13;
Expenditure (SOE), the documentation for which would not be submitted to IDA but retained by&#13;
PAD in Islamabad and made available during the course of project supervision. It is estimated that&#13;
about US$ 8.6 million equivalent would be disbursed through SOEs. Individual small contracts&#13;
for works, goods, services and training can be claimed through submission of Statement of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
Expenditures. PAD would be required to keep all documentation relating to these activities for&#13;
inspection by IDA and for audit.&#13;
2.26        Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account would be opened&#13;
by PAD, with an amount of up to US$1.2 million in the National Bank of Pakistan on terms and&#13;
conditions acceptable to IDA. This would be used for IDA's share of project expenditures&#13;
(equivalent to the requirement for about 4 months). The Special Account would be operated and&#13;
maintained by PAD and would be used for payments of all eligible foreign and local&#13;
expenditures. The Special Account would be replenished on a monthly basis or whenever 20% of&#13;
the account has been utilized, whichever occurs first.&#13;

111. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Assessment of Current Arrangements&#13;
3.1          PAD, which is presently responsible for most of governments' accounting functions&#13;
and for the external audit of government's financial transactions, has an established organization&#13;
and structure, including decentralized offices providing accounting, treasury functions and audit for&#13;
each of the federal and four provincial governments. Financial regulations and procedures are in&#13;
place. PAD has some experience of introducing and operating computerized financial systems,&#13;
although these have tended to automate the previously existing procedures rather than to amend&#13;
systems to introduce modern financial management. It has a network of training institutes. Staff in&#13;
PAD belong to the audit and accounts service, which is a recognized category (cadre) within the&#13;
Civil Service of Pakistan. These features provide a positive base from which to develop PAD's&#13;
capacity. Nevertheless, the detailed evaluation of current institutional arrangements for&#13;
government's fiscal reporting and auditing (para. 1.6) highlights weaknesses in the outputs from&#13;
existing financial systems. It identifies institutional constraints including the lack of arrangements&#13;
to ensure that systems respond to users' needs, the limited availability of staff with up-to-date&#13;
professional or technical skills, the lack of independence of audit from accounting, and poor human&#13;
resource management practices within PAD.&#13;
B. Addressing Institutional Constraints&#13;
3.2          The project scope and design addresses the institutional constraints through:&#13;
a)    initiating a gradual transfer of responsibility for accounting to the executive arm of&#13;
government, separate from audit;&#13;
b)    strengthening the capacity of PAD by developing an MIS Wing;&#13;
c)    encouraging greater use of private sector audit firms to augment PAD's skills;&#13;
e)    developing PAD's staff through improved HRM policies and training;&#13;
0     close involvement of users in project systems' design and coordination; and&#13;
g)    use of consultants for design and implementation technical assistance.&#13;
3.3          Separation of Audit and Accounts As a first step towards separation of the&#13;
audit and accounts functions, PAD has already initiated moves to bifurcate the two functions&#13;
under the Auditor General to such an extent that the eventual transfer of the accounting function&#13;
to the executive would not have any wide-ranging organizational implications. As part of the&#13;
bifurcation process it would be necessary for the Auditor General to ensure that essential internal&#13;
controls are in place and operating in the accounting wing. Following full implementation of this&#13;
bifurcation PAD would, by 1997/98, set up a task force to identify and address issues&#13;
(legal/regulatory, administrative and procedural) relating to the transfer of the accounting&#13;
function to the executive. Regulatory changes would be prepared as required, and the separation&#13;
would be planned to become effective from July 1, 2000 subject to government approval.&#13;
Agreement was obtained at negotiations that GOP shall prepare a plan for the separation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
Auditor General's accounting and audit functions by July 1, 2000, and to achieve the separation&#13;
by that date, shall : (a) complete bifurcation of the audit and accounting functions by June 30,&#13;
1997; (b) complete detailed proposals for the functional separation of audit and accounting by&#13;
March 31, 1999; and (c) thereafter take all measures necessary to effect the separation of these&#13;
functions (para. 6.1).&#13;
3.4         Creation of an MIS Wing The project would strengthen PAD's capacity by&#13;
reorganizing the existing Computer Directorate and creating an Management Information Systems&#13;
(MIS) Wing, headed by a General Manager (MIS). The General Manager (MIS) would be a&#13;
computer professional, recruited externally on a project post for a period of up to 5 years. During&#13;
this period, PAD would attach officers to be trained to potentially take over this position by the&#13;
end of the project. The General Manager (MIS) would have the status of a Deputy Auditor&#13;
General, reporting to the Auditor General, with complete autonomy with respect to technical&#13;
issues.&#13;
3.5         There would be three sections in the MIS Wing each headed by a Director&#13;
General:&#13;
a)    a Standards and Policies Section would be responsible for defining and keeping&#13;
under review PAD's standards and policies with regard to information systems,&#13;
and also responsible for detailed technical aspects of any central acquisition of&#13;
hardware and software;&#13;
b)    a Systems Development Section which would be responsible for the development&#13;
and maintenance of the application systems with the assistance of consultants; and,&#13;
c)    an Implementation Section which would be responsible for the implementation of&#13;
developed systems and the day to day operations of the computer installations&#13;
around the country.&#13;
3.6         In the case of field offices, all personnel (including those responsible for day to&#13;
day field operations) would report within the field office structure, (i.e. to the DAO or AG),&#13;
except for a limited number of technical positions under the Director General Implementation,&#13;
responsible for providing technical support, but located at AG offices. A key factor in the overall&#13;
implementation strategy would be that the responsibility for implementation would be assigned&#13;
to an end-user support group formed at each AG office which would be headed by a Deputy&#13;
Accountant General and which would be dedicated to systems implementation. The end-user&#13;
support group would be trained by the technical team and would thereafter be responsible for&#13;
training all other personnel at the AG offices as well as at DAOs.&#13;
3.7         Involvement of the Private Sector Information about the project and its&#13;
proposed approach is being made widely available and comments sought from the accounting&#13;
profession in Pakistan. These comments have been incorporated in the project design. PAD has&#13;
proposed a phased strategy to initiate further private sector participation based upon:&#13;
a)    study of potential areas for greater private sector involvement, including&#13;
opportunities to reduce overlap and for more efficient use of audit resources, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
scope for joint working between public and private sector auditors, and the&#13;
comparative advantages of each sector;&#13;
b)    pilot introduction of audits by private sector firms under amended procedures,&#13;
joint audits, staff exchanges, etc.;&#13;
c)    extension of trial public/private partnerships in government auditing, together&#13;
with preparation of revised operating procedures, manuals, and quality control&#13;
arrangements; and&#13;
d)    gradual expansion of the program as appropriate.&#13;
3.11        Human Resource Management To reflect its need for increased&#13;
professionalism and specialization, PAD would implement revised HRM policies including:&#13;
a) developing a structured career path for specialist staff including auditors and&#13;
accountants;&#13;
b) rotating staff on assignments in accordance with this career path and prior experience,&#13;
and assigning jobs for a nornal period of at least three years;&#13;
c) defining standard job descriptions for recruitment, deployment, training and&#13;
evaluation purposes;&#13;
d) enhancing the effectiveness of training, including requiring staff to be committed to&#13;
remaining in PAD prior to receiving entry-level training, and relating training more&#13;
closely to job descriptions and training needs assessments;&#13;
e) developing a system of quantifiable and transparent evaluation and evolving an open,&#13;
merit-based, promotion and reward system; and&#13;
f) detailed manpower planning.&#13;
3.12        Training Key initiatives aimed at increasing the professional competence of&#13;
PAD staff would include:&#13;
a) replacing the current eight month entry-level training for probationary officers with a&#13;
two year course;&#13;
b) substitution of the SAS examination for mid-level staff by that of the Association of&#13;
Accounting Technicians;&#13;
c) substantial reduction in promotion of unqualified candidates from mid-level grades,&#13;
and allowing direct-entry recruitment of individuals with appropriate MBA/graduate&#13;
qualifications, subject to accountancy examination success within a prescribed period;&#13;
d) training for officers due for promotion to B- 1 9;&#13;
e) encouragement for officers to acquire an accredited financial qualification; and&#13;
f) instituting a program of training for continuing professional education.&#13;
3.13         PAD is coordinating the proposed changes for its career officers with the Federal&#13;
Public Service Commission and the Establishment Division. In addition to developing and&#13;
delivering training for the above, PAD's training strategy would also address training needs&#13;
related to the implementation of the new working arrangements and procedures to be introduced&#13;
through the project. A third aspect of PAD's training strategy would be to extend financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
management training to include selected provincial and secretariat personnel within the circle of&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
3.14        User Involvement A Steering Committee has been formed to ensure user&#13;
involvement in the project and to perform the functions of interagency coordination.&#13;
Representatives from MOF, Economic Affairs Division, Planning Division, Pakistan Computer&#13;
Bureau, and all four Provinces will assist PAD to ensure that the financial accounting systems&#13;
developed by the project are responsive to user requirements and interests, that users' training&#13;
needs are met, and that systems and procedures relating to audit are effective. Other relevant&#13;
agencies would be co-opted as necessary. PAD would also coordinate with the Federal Public&#13;
Service Commission and the Establishment Division on aspects relating to the implementation of&#13;
its human resource management strategy. Users would be directly involved in the definition of&#13;
the financial reporting systems development, through consultation with the systems design&#13;
consultants. PAD would extend its training to include users from outside the department.&#13;

4.1         The organizations responsible for implementation of sub-components of the&#13;
project are: PAD, MOF, and the Planning Commission. The aspects of the project relating to&#13;
government accounting and audit would be PAD's responsibility. MOF and the Planning&#13;
Commission would implement the component for strengthening economic management. The&#13;
institutional responsibilities for project implementation are shown below:&#13;

B. Implementation Responsibilities&#13;
4.3         PAD's components of the project would be implemented by the sections within&#13;
the Department that are already responsible for the respective function, with suitable&#13;
strengthening as required. Hence, the Controller General (Accounts) would be responsible for&#13;
the accounting component. A new General Manager (MIS) would lead the computer systems&#13;
development as head of the MIS Wing. Since the bulk of the work related to information&#13;
systems development deals with the implementation of accounting systems, the Director General&#13;
(Implementation) who is part of the MIS Wing would have a dual reporting relationship and&#13;
would be functionally responsible to the Deputy Auditor General (Accounts &amp; Payments) for&#13;
implementation. The Deputy Auditor General (Government Audit) would be responsible for&#13;
implementation of the audit component. The Director General of Training, head of the Audit and&#13;
Accounts Training Institute (AATI), based in Lahore and with regional offices in Balochistan&#13;
and NWFP, would be responsible for the training component. The Director General, Human&#13;
Resource Management, would be responsible for the HRM component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
4.4         For project administration and coordination purposes, the Controller General&#13;
(Accounts), the DAG (Government Audit), the General Manager (MIS), the Director General&#13;
(Training), and the DG (HRM) would report to the Project Director. The project director would&#13;
be assisted by the DG (R&amp;D) as project coordinator and head of the Project Directorate. Initially,&#13;
the Auditor General would be the Project Director.&#13;
4.5         The Project Directorate, which is already established for project preparation,&#13;
would provide project coordination, administration and monitoring. It would have overall&#13;
responsibility for monitoring project costs, funds flow, adherence to schedules and quality of&#13;
work performed. It would receive monthly reports from heads of the units managing sub-&#13;
components from which it would prepare overall project summary progress reports. These&#13;
reports would summarize project expenditures by major project activities and category of&#13;
expenditure, report work progress relative to the major project milestones and performance&#13;
indicators, and would highlight any issues relevant to project progress. Summary reports would&#13;
be provided to the Bank on a quarterly basis. The Project Directorate would be assisted by a&#13;
local consultant, to provide backup services and peak-load facilities as required.&#13;
4.6         Agreement was obtained at negotiations that PAD would: (a) employ staff with&#13;
qualifications satisfactory to IDA in the key posts of Controller General (Accounts), Deputy&#13;
Auditor General (Government Audit), General Manager (MIS), Director General (HRM),&#13;
Director General (Training); (b) designate and maintain a Project Director satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
with overall responsibility for project implementation; (c) employ within the Project Directorate&#13;
a Project Coordinator and a Deputy Project Coordinator, with qualifications satisfactory to the&#13;
Association and other staff necessary for the carrying out of the Directorate's functions, and that&#13;
these key staff, subject to satisfactory performance, would be retained in post for a minimum of&#13;
three years (para. 6.1).&#13;
4.7         The MOF and the Planning Commission would set up project management&#13;
arrangements for managing the studies carried out and the short-term technical assistance provided&#13;
under their respective sub- components. Agreement was obtained at negotiations that MOF and the&#13;
Planning Commission would set up by December 31, 1996, project management arrangements&#13;
satisfactory to IDA for the studies carried out and the short-term technical assistance provided&#13;
under their respective components (para. 6.1).&#13;
C. Implementation Strategy&#13;
4.8         PAD's implementation strategy involves defining new standards for accounting and&#13;
auditing, which move closer to international standards, and introducing improved systems in a&#13;
phased manner with close involvement of end-users of financial reporting and auditing information.&#13;
The focus of development would first be upon accounting systems, although measures for the initial&#13;
strengthening of audit are also incorporated.&#13;
4.9         Accounting Standards and Financial Reporting  This activity to improve&#13;
financial reporting would define a modem set of accounting guidelines, including the introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
of a double entry accounting model, and a set of policies and procedures for accounts payable,&#13;
revenues and liabilities recognition, foreign loans, suspense accounts and development projects,&#13;
and prepare a plan for implementation government-wide. It would also review the financial&#13;
reporting needs of government and broadly determine the content, timing and distribution of&#13;
financial reports. This work is a prerequisite for the commencement of the main information&#13;
systems development consultancy, and would need to precede the design and development of the&#13;
Core Information Systems. It would be undertaken by the systems development consultants, and&#13;
financed up to Credit effectiveness by PPF P916-0 PAK.&#13;
4.10         Core Information Systems As PAD's account keeping operations for federal and&#13;
provincial governments are conducted by its network of AG's offices, each supported by&#13;
DAOs/Treasuries, PAD has overall control of the process, which enables flexibility during&#13;
implementation. A factor affecting the implementation strategy is that all AG offices and several of&#13;
the larger DAOs are already operating computer-based systems, and therefore would face less&#13;
difficulty than a green field site in installing new software.&#13;
4.11  Accordingly, the core information systems will be implemented in a phased manner as&#13;
follows:&#13;
a) Phase I would cover requirements definition, functional and technical design,&#13;
specification and procurement of the hardware and software required for&#13;
implementation, with development centered at PAD's head office.&#13;
b) In Phase II, the systems would be implemented at the federal government's main&#13;
accounting office, the AGPR office in Islamabad, at the AG's office in Peshawar and&#13;
at two DAOs reporting to this AG which are already computerized. This is referred to&#13;
as the pilot implementation.&#13;
c) In Phase III the systems will be replicated over the course of this project to a total of&#13;
about 21 of the 95 sites, including all provincial AG offices, and selected DAOs&#13;
within each province. This would include maximum coverage in at least one&#13;
Province (presently identified as Sindh), referred to as the Province-wide system&#13;
replication. The remaining sites would be selected with a view to maximizing the&#13;
coverage of federal transactions.&#13;
4.12         For development of the applications software, the systems analysis and&#13;
comprehensive functional design would be carried out by consultants, who would also carry out a&#13;
search for suitable software packages. In the event of suitable packages being identified, the&#13;
consultants would prepare specifications for, assist procure and supervise an ICB turnkey contract&#13;
for acquisition and installation of the package, its customization, and acquisition and installation of&#13;
suitable hardware and operating software. In the event of no suitable package being identified, the&#13;
consultants would prepare specifications for, assist procure and supervise two contracts, one for the&#13;
development and testing of software, and another for the provision/installation of the hardware.&#13;
Supervision of implementation at about 12 sites (4 pilot sites and the first phase of replication -&#13;
about 8 sites) would also be the responsibility of the consultants selected for preparing the design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
The scope of work for the consultants is described in more detail in Annex 3. The project would&#13;
finance assistance from private firms for further replication of systems across the remaining sites.&#13;
The implementation schedule shows possible time savings of 6-9 months if suitable application&#13;
software packages could be identified.&#13;
4.13        Technology Strategy for PAD's Core Information Systems Computer systems&#13;
would, as far as possible, be designed to:&#13;
a) be open and portable to avoid becoming tied to a single supplier;&#13;
b) facilitate adaptability and updating; and&#13;
c) keep pace with emerging technology innovations.&#13;
4.14        The project envisages a distributed hardware arhitecture with computer&#13;
processing power located at the various nodes of the network (the AGPR office, AG offices,&#13;
and DAOs). Where facilities allow and data volumes justify, nodes would be connected via&#13;
telecommunications facilities. Alternatively, data transfer would be via diskettes. The&#13;
transaction processing and database management required at each node would be carried out by&#13;
the computer at that node. Summary or detailed data, as required, would be transmitted to the&#13;
computers located at the respective AG's office and AGPR in Islamabad. The advantage of such&#13;
an architecture is that it distributes computing power, commensurate with needs, to different&#13;
nodes of the network, thereby optimizing usage, and making it less vulnerable to malfunctions at&#13;
a single central site. In addition, end-users at provincial AG and DAOs would have better&#13;
control over their technology and data resources, strengthening systems' ownership. The size&#13;
and distribution of computing power across the various nodes of the network would be&#13;
determined by the volumes of data and transactions that are generated and stored, and the&#13;
volumes and frequencies of data transmitted. Information gathered from PAD has been used to&#13;
estimate the size and location of computers. This information would be progressively refined by&#13;
the consultants during the preparation phase of the project, by undertaking surveys to gather data&#13;
for each site.&#13;
4.15        The nature of the application systems requires that the application software be&#13;
able to run on small or large computers without major changes (scaleable) and be able to operate&#13;
on machines offered by several vendors (portable). The project proposes to use UNIX as the&#13;
operating systems environment since, in practice, this environment comes closest to an OPEN&#13;
systems environment and ensures a high degree of scalability and portability. In addition, the&#13;
application development environment chosen will use Fourth Generation Languages and&#13;
Relational Data Base Management Systems and associated development tools, Graphical User&#13;
Interfaces to increase application development productivity and offer a user friendly environment&#13;
for data access and usage.&#13;
4.16  Implications of large scale computerization on PAD staffing   PAD recognizes that a&#13;
department wide introduction of computer based information systems would have significant&#13;
implications for staff. Although PAD does not expect overall staff reductions, it does expect&#13;
significant staff reassignments, and based on its past experience with the introduction of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
automated systems it appreciates the importance of appropriate manpower policies in order to&#13;
achieve successful implementation of change. Several aspects would be catered for:&#13;
a) the skills of staff who currently maintain the manual systems would be augmented so&#13;
that they are able to operate and maintain the new automated systems;&#13;
b) retraining or recruitment would provide for the jobs created related to the operation&#13;
and maintenance of the systems (both in the functional and the technical areas); and,&#13;
c) other staff would be re-trained and re-assigned, mostly to audit where additional staff&#13;
are required.&#13;
4.17        As part of this project, PAD are concurrently looking at the staffing and training/&#13;
re-training aspects under the HRM and training components respectively. An extensive training&#13;
program is envisaged for staff to enable them to operate and maintain the systems. In addition,&#13;
facilities for re-training would be created or augmented as part of the training component,&#13;
including training for reassignment.&#13;
4.18  Auditing Government plans to strengthen the legislative audit function, through the use&#13;
of consultants, within a conceptual framework comprising the following:&#13;
a) moving towards adopting international auditing standards developed by INTOSAI;&#13;
b) developing the principle of public accountability;&#13;
c) improving financial reporting and control systems;&#13;
d) enhancing the scope and independence of audit;&#13;
e) strengthening performance monitoring and evaluation capacity, through new&#13;
procedures and computerized audit tools;&#13;
f) increasing the competence and capacity of government auditors, including making&#13;
greater use of the private sector; and&#13;
g) building future capacity - through revised HRM procedures, international training in a&#13;
modem financial systems environment, and arranging attachments with other Supreme&#13;
Audit Institutions&#13;
4.19        In the move towards adoption of INTOSAI standards of auditing, PAD considers&#13;
that it has adequate powers in respect of performance auditing and reporting to the legislature. The&#13;
practice of PAD conducting performance audit has been in place since the early 1980s and resulting&#13;
audit reports have been considered by the Public Accounts Committees of the federal and&#13;
provincial legislatures. The executive and the legislature's support for performance audit indicates&#13;
that PAD's mandate in the area is not disputed. This gives a firm basis to start the process of&#13;
adoption of standards in the auditing area.&#13;
4.20        HEM  PAD recognizes that the project cannot be successfully executed and&#13;
sustained unless its human resources are efficiently deployed, are of substantially improved&#13;
quality, and are properly motivated. It would therefore implement an HRM policy designed to&#13;
raise the level of professional competence of staff, to institute a system of continuous&#13;
professional education, to provide a structured career path, to evolve a promotion and reward&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
policy based on open and quantified performance standards and a recognized merit system, and&#13;
to improve related management information systems.&#13;
4.21        Iraining The strategy for training addresses:&#13;
a) the needs arising from introduction of changes in accounting and audit procedures;&#13;
b) improving the quality of existing training (for example, relating training courses more&#13;
closely to training needs assessments) and training facilities;&#13;
c) expanding the circle of beneficiaries to include provincial staff and users in line&#13;
departments;&#13;
d) moving towards professionalism in training of government accountants and auditors&#13;
(for lower and higher levels of staff), and upgrading facilities.&#13;
4.22        The Audit and Accounts Training Institutes (AATI) would provide formal&#13;
training (for example, for accounting technicians and probationers), short courses, and provide&#13;
course material and backstopping for field office training. PAD would strengthen the AATI and&#13;
augment them by establishing Field Office Training Centers (FOTCs) at the larger accounting&#13;
offices to provide training in revised procedures, and basic computer skills. The component&#13;
would be implemented in the following sequence:&#13;
a) preparation for the Accounting Technician qualification, which can be accommodated&#13;
within the existing competence of the training faculty, updating existing training&#13;
materials, upgrading the capacity of faculty staff, through training, to prepare for&#13;
introducing the enhanced probationers training and retraining in revised procedures,&#13;
and training quality control measures;&#13;
b) introduction of Accounting Technicians training courses, training needs analysis,&#13;
course and materials preparation, and training of trainers for the enhanced&#13;
probationers and staff retraining courses, and renovation of facilities;&#13;
c) introduction of enhanced probationers and staff retraining courses, equipping of&#13;
computer training facilities, and initial annual impact evaluation.&#13;
4.23        Economic Management Agreed recommendations of the studies financed under&#13;
this component would be used to draw up an agenda for policy and/or institutional reforms in&#13;
specific areas. The strengthening of institutional capacities of and coordination between the&#13;
MOF and the Planning Commission in economic management is a long-term endeavor requiring&#13;
detailed diagnosis and follow-up to the 1993 Economy Commission recommendations. The&#13;
diagnostic study of the institutional arrangements for macroeconomic management would assess&#13;
options for strengthening capacity for the formulation of strategies on longer-term development&#13;
finance issues. The study would look at institutional, staffing and financing arrangements for&#13;
developing the government's forward planning and policy analysis capacity, including how to&#13;
better link the policy work required by Finance with the longer-term development planning&#13;
currently handled by the Planning Commission. It would also assess how to attract and retain the&#13;
highly skilled and experienced staff required, as well as the related training requirements. GOP&#13;
and IDA would jointly formulate action plans to implement the agreed recommendations of the&#13;
economic, financial policy, and diagnostic studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
4.24        Implementation Plan The implementation strategy is reflected in the agreed&#13;
implementation plan (Annex 6). Agreement was obtained at negotiations that GOP would&#13;
implement the Project in accordance with the agreed implementation plan; and would by&#13;
January 31, 1997 and by each January 31 thereafter review and update the implementation plan&#13;
in consultation with the Association (para. 6. 1).&#13;
D. Status of Preparation&#13;
4.25        The Project is in an advanced state of preparation and hence proposed project&#13;
activities would commence without undue delay. Preparatory activities for the project, financed&#13;
by a Project Preparation Facility (P916-0 PAK), include:&#13;
a)   initiating the consultancy for developing accounting principles, standards and a&#13;
financial reporting framework to guide the detailed systems design;&#13;
b)    establishment of the MIS organization structure by appointment of a computer&#13;
professional as General Manager MIS and other key staff in the MIS wing;&#13;
c)    undertaking a training needs analysis for provincial government staff including&#13;
users of financial information, accountants and auditors;&#13;
d)   training for MOF, provincial and PAD's HRM, MIS and training institute staff;&#13;
e)    preparation of detailed designs and tender documents for civil works for site&#13;
preparation and training facility renovation works; and&#13;
f)    project management training and assistance with setting up project management&#13;
systems.&#13;
4.26        The project's Planning Commission Formn I (PC-1) has been approved by&#13;
ECNEC. Consultants are selected for the accounting standards and systems design consultancy.&#13;
(The scope of work is summarized in Annex 3.) It was agreed at negotiations that PAD's&#13;
appointment of the accounting standards and systems design consultants (and of IDA to issue its&#13;
no objection) would be a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 6.2). The project management&#13;
directorate is in place and PAD is in the process of recruiting key technical personnel. It was&#13;
agreed at negotiations that appointment of the General Manager (MIS) to the satisfaction of IDA&#13;
would be a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 6.2).&#13;
E. Project Sustainability&#13;
4.27        The sustainability of the project would largely depend upon project ownership and&#13;
commitment to project objectives. Ownership is strengthened as the project builds upon&#13;
initiatives already taken by PAD to computerize accounting. PAD has extensively discussed its&#13;
development strategy internally within the department, including with middle management, to&#13;
attempt to build a broadly based consensus. Under PAD's direction, project preparation has tried&#13;
to develop participation through thoroughly canvassing user needs, and the development strategy&#13;
has obtained the commitment of federal government and three of the four provincial&#13;
governments, who would be directly involved in guiding and monitoring the project through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
membership of the Steering Committee. Participation in the project's implementation includes&#13;
Pakistan's professional accountancy bodies. Technology changes would be institutionalized&#13;
through recruitment of specialists, departmental reorganization and structured training.&#13;
Establishment of an MIS wing would provide the necessary technical skills for systems&#13;
development and maintenance. Staff to be involved in systems maintenance would be initially&#13;
associated with systems development. In areas such as information technology where PAD lacks&#13;
suitable skills, it would recruit technical staff required for the implementation of the project from&#13;
the open market. Human resource management policies would be amended to facilitate retaining&#13;
specialist skills and to make better use of trained staff, and further institutional support would be&#13;
arranged through training. Training would be extended to provinces and executive departments,&#13;
to provide the skills to better use the improved financial information, thereby reinforcing the&#13;
future demand for such data. It is recognized that systems operations will have an ongoing&#13;
impact on recurrent costs, estimated to amount to about $1.3 million equivalent per annum. This&#13;
will be provided for in the armual budget after the project is completed. Increased participation&#13;
of the private sector would also help ensure sustainability. PAD has confirmed its intentions to&#13;
involve private sector audit firms in the public sector,while remaining within the context of the&#13;
Auditor General's responsibilities under the Constitution. IDA has already recognized that&#13;
completing automation of all 95 sites will require a follow-up project, which will help further&#13;
institutionalize the changes introduced in this project.&#13;
F. Accounts and Audit&#13;
4.28 PAD, Planning Commission and MOF would maintain separate accounts for their&#13;
respective parts of the project, and would keep all the documentation including that for the&#13;
Statement of Expenditures. PAD would prepare consolidated project accounts annually. IDA&#13;
would require annual audit reports from external auditors (independent and suitably qualified) for&#13;
project accounts with a separate opinion on the Special Account and the Statement of&#13;
Expenditures. The Audit Reports would be submitted to the IDA within six months after the end&#13;
of a financial year. In order to assure transparency and independence, PAD has agreed that it&#13;
would engage a private sector audit firm for this purpose, subject to the concurrence of&#13;
government. PAD would prepare and submit to IDA within six months after the close of each&#13;
fiscal year fully audited consolidated project accounts including an auditor's opinion and report&#13;
for the project, SOEs and Special Accounts, undertaken by auditors satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
G. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.29  Significant performance indicators and project milestones (para. 2.10 and Annex 8) will be&#13;
used as a basis for monitoring and evaluating the project. A thorough mid-term review would be&#13;
incorporated to assess performance achieved, and to review the appropriateness and continuing&#13;
relevance of the project's design, including taking account of technology changes. PAD has&#13;
developed a project implementation management system to monitor progress. A summary of its&#13;
resulting implementation plan appears as Annex 6. Quarterly progress reports would be provided&#13;
to IDA. A mid-term review would be scheduled three years after credit effectiveness, to coincide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
with the completion of the pilot implementation phase, would be conducted by PAD, Planning&#13;
Commission and MOF with IDA. Performance as assessed during the mid-term review would be&#13;
an important consideration for preparation of a future project. Agreement was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that PAD, MOF and Planning Commission would prepare, by April 30, 1999, a report&#13;
evaluating progress to date, including recommendations to enhance implementation of the project,&#13;
which would form the basis for a mid-term review by June 30, 1999 (para. 6.1). In addition to&#13;
Headquarters supervision for the project, the anticipated heavy supervision demands would be&#13;
internalized to the extent possible through use of consultancy firms to assist change management&#13;
and for institutional development.&#13;
4.30        A senior level panel of internationally-experienced experts would be constituted&#13;
to meet at least annually and advise the govermment on ways to continually enhance the project's&#13;
contribution towards achieving its vision for financial management and public accountability&#13;
(this panel would report to the steering committee). The panel of experts would comprise at least&#13;
three international experts, having among them expertise in Government Accounting,&#13;
Government Auditing, and Information Systems Development. Preference would be given to&#13;
officers serving in (or just retired from) Supreme Audit Institutions/ Govenmment Accounting&#13;
Organizations. The panel may also include two or three local counterpart experts. Agreement&#13;
was obtained at negotiations that PAD would establish by December 31, 1996 and retain during&#13;
the implementation of the project, an international panel of experts with membership and&#13;
responsibilities satisfactory to IDA (para. 6.1).&#13;
4.31        In view of the significant complexity of the project, Bank staff and consultant&#13;
supervision inputs are expected to be high and atypical as compared to average, but comparable to&#13;
other similar projects. It is estimated that the requirement will be in the range of 25-30 staff weeks&#13;
per year as indicated in the supervision plan attached at Annex 9. Supervision would include:&#13;
a)    general portfolio management - review of procurement and consultant contracting&#13;
documents, progress reports and correspondence;&#13;
b)   formal reviews - participation in the mid-term and other reviews; and&#13;
c)    participation in regular progress meetings (by local consultants);&#13;
d)   routine biannual supervision missions.&#13;
4.32        Two supervision missions would be necessary annually, each for a period of two&#13;
weeks on average. Supervision missions would normally require participation from the task&#13;
manager, auditing, accounting, human resource and information systems specialists. Supervision of&#13;
the policy support component would require participation from a macro economist. Total staff&#13;
inputs for these missions would be about 20 staff weeks per year. The proposed level of&#13;
supervision includes local as well as Headquarters inputs. The use of local consultants would&#13;
reduce the total costs of supervision. The continued high level of supervision towards the end of&#13;
the project reflects the timing of implementation of the pilot systems and their replication.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1         Benefits would include improved, timely, accurate and consistent financial&#13;
information from the 21 automated sites to assist resource planning, cash management, budgeting,&#13;
management and control at provincial and federal levels of government, and improved fiscal&#13;
information flows for macro-economic management. The improved financial informnation would&#13;
assist Government in its efforts to complete fiscal adjustment. It would also provide a basis for&#13;
enhanced governance. The project would also set the stage for subsequent initiatives to improve&#13;
government financial reproting and auditing.&#13;
5.2         Basic accounting information underpinning financial management decisions would&#13;
be prepared according to enhanced accounting standards, thereby providing the basis for more&#13;
informed decision-making. Financial monitoring reports would be geared to users' needs, and&#13;
would incorporate information presently missing such as budget and variance information, and&#13;
details, by project, of development expenditure. This improved financial infornation would enable&#13;
strengthened management and monitoring of public expenditures, and hence assist improved&#13;
economic performance. Systems would provide the information required for cash flow forecasting,&#13;
thereby improving cash management and reducing the costs of short term borrowing.&#13;
5.3         Government financial management performance would benefit through&#13;
strengthened audit, by introducing modern audit techniques, reporting formats and quality controls.&#13;
Financial management skills within government would also be developed by training, by improved&#13;
human resource management policies, and by making greater use of the resources and capacity of&#13;
private audit firms. Such improvements in financial management would gradually increase the&#13;
effectiveness of public expenditures.&#13;
5.4         Governance would be assisted by the improved financial infornation and systems,&#13;
which would provide clearer linkages between budgeting, use of resources, internal controls and&#13;
accountability. The International Federation of Accountants considers that sound accounting is the&#13;
first line of good governance. As the project would address many of the weaknesses in the present&#13;
arrangements for government accounting, it would lay a stronger foundation for improved&#13;
governance. Greater capacity and independence of governments' external audit would enhance&#13;
transparency and accountability, thereby further assisting strengthened governance.&#13;
5.5        Assistance to MOF and the Planning Commission would enable the government to&#13;
better fulfill its redefined role by increasing capacity to formulate and monitor policies for&#13;
deepening macroeconomic and structural reforms, and by identifying the institutional changes&#13;
required for better coordination of such policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
5.6         The following aspects of the project were selected from the range of possible&#13;
alternatives in order to achieve a cost effective solution to Governments' financial information&#13;
needs, and to provide a set of efficient and effective tools for public expenditure management:&#13;
a) the financial systems improvements would initially focus upon improving the quality&#13;
of accounting and financial information, thus strengthening the platform for existing&#13;
financial management and control procedures, and all subsequent improvements&#13;
thereto;&#13;
b) the project would address a major structural weakness in present arrangements by&#13;
separating functional responsibilities for accounting and audit, thereby creating&#13;
independence which would enhance the contribution of both functions to improved&#13;
public expenditure management;&#13;
c) the project includes measures to increase institutional capacity through amending&#13;
manpower policies, training, use of the private sector in areas of comparative&#13;
advantage, and technical assistance, to enhance the development impact of improved&#13;
financial information, and to ensure sustainability of the improved procedures;&#13;
d) financial systems would be prepared in the context of an overall information&#13;
architecture for government fiscal management, to ensure they are integrated amongst&#13;
themselves and with other Government systems, and to avoid overlapping or&#13;
duplication of functionality;&#13;
e) the technological approach proposed in the project, based on distributed, OPEN and&#13;
scaleable systems, strikes a balance between large mainframe systems which would&#13;
be cumbersome and expensive and other PC-based options (e.g. stand-alone PCs)&#13;
which could be under-powered and not scaleable to sites with a large number of&#13;
transactions; and&#13;
f) the phased implementation strategy of the computerized financial systems, restricting&#13;
the implementation to 21 out of a total 95 sites, is a prudent approach to managing&#13;
implementation risks.&#13;
5.7         The total cost of the project amounts to approximately 0.25% of annual public&#13;
expenditure in Pakistan. The benefits of even minor improvements to the efficiency,&#13;
effectiveness or management of public expenditure, which would arise from improved financial&#13;
information and control, would exceed project costs. The net development impact of the project&#13;
is therefore expected to be positive. The fiscal impact of the project's cost would be negligible.&#13;
C. RISKS&#13;
5.8         Due to the extent of change envisaged, this project should be considered as high&#13;
risk. Although identified risks and mitigating measures are summarized below, as the project&#13;
would address sensitive areas related to control and reporting of financial transactions, would&#13;
introduce structural changes within PAD, and would install new technology, reluctance and at times&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
even resistance to implementation should be anticipated to occur, and the full achievement of&#13;
objectives should therefore be considered uncertain.&#13;
5.9          The main categories of risk facing the project are:&#13;
a) Vested interests.  By improving the quality of financial systems and reporting, the&#13;
project would introduce controls which would affect those who benefit from&#13;
weaknesses in present arrangements. These interests may act to delay the project, or to&#13;
divert it from its objectives. The following would assist to manage this risk: (i) support&#13;
from those senior levels of government which do acknowledge the need to improve and&#13;
update governments' current financial systems; (ii) monitoring and guidance by a panel&#13;
of international experts - drawn from other Supreme Audit and Accounting Institutions&#13;
- to provide external perspectives and professional peer pressure; and (iii) the phased&#13;
and relatively gradual introduction of new systems, allowing a wider appreciation of&#13;
benefits to develop, enhancing ownership.&#13;
b) Resistance to change. Organizational risks include PAD's capacity for managing the&#13;
process of change, especially those aspects related to its union and staff concerns arising&#13;
from the introduction of new procedures, technology and the functional separation of&#13;
accounting and audit. The Auditor General understands the need for leadership, for&#13;
clear direction and for keeping staff fully informed and involved, to reduce these risks.&#13;
A change-management specialist would advise on processes and appropriate actions.&#13;
The Steering Committee, comprising key users of financial information, would assist to&#13;
ensure that end-users are fully involved and buy into the proposed changes. The project&#13;
includes extensive training and retraining opportunities for staff within and outside PAD&#13;
to prepare for change.&#13;
c) Technology development and operation.  Risks related to the development and&#13;
operation of computer-based financial information systems arise as staff have limited&#13;
technical skills and experience of technically more complex financial systems. These&#13;
risks are mitigated somewhat by the fact that PAD already has some prior experience of&#13;
developing and operating computer systems in its five Accountant Generals offices and&#13;
several District Accounts Offices. These offices would also face less difficulty in&#13;
installing new systems than a green-field site. The project also supports strengthening&#13;
PAD's capacity to manage technology by creating an MIS Wing, headed by a General&#13;
Manager recruited from the open market. Certain other key technical posts would also&#13;
be filled by local staff on contract terms. The development of new systems would be&#13;
under the control of internationally experienced consultants, with PAD staff involved in&#13;
development to prepare for eventually operating and maintaining the systems.&#13;
d)                _                 . Obtaining the benefits of improved technology&#13;
requires skills to control the quality of financial data inputs, and to apply the financial&#13;
information generated. The project includes three measures to address the risk of&#13;
inadequate skills. Changes to HRM policies, to provide a structured career path for&#13;
accounting and audit specialists, would underpin efforts for institutional development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Upgrading of skills would be addressed by improved training, including for the users of&#13;
financial information, and consultants would provide technical assistance in specific&#13;
aspects. The project would support greater involvement of local private sector firns in&#13;
public sector financial management to further increase capacity.&#13;
e) Project management. The complexity of the project, and the likelihood of delays in&#13;
decision-making and implementation, increase project management risks. A committed&#13;
and stable team of senior management within PAD is considered a critical factor to deal&#13;
with this risk. Many of these key staff have been involved during project preparation,&#13;
thus developing ownership. Project conditionality limiting key staff transfers would&#13;
help to retain a stable team. There is an existing Project Directorate, with experience of&#13;
implementing a component of the Third Technical Assistance Project (Cr.1755-PAK)&#13;
and this project's preparation, which will be strengthened further and given logistical&#13;
support by consultants. Monitoring arrangements include a detailed implementation&#13;
plan, performance indicators and intensive supervision.&#13;
f) Policy Changes.  There is a risk that policy changes or revised administrative&#13;
arrangements could be introduced which would disrupt the project. To mitigate this&#13;
type of risk, the government has approved a vision statement for financial reporting and&#13;
auditing which is fully in line with project objectives. Two final risks are delays in&#13;
initiating the economic management studies and of weak commitment to implement the&#13;
policy and institutional changes recommended by them. To mitigate these risks, terms&#13;
of reference for key studies will be submitted prior to negotiations, and action plans for&#13;
implementing their recommendations will form part of the annual review and updating&#13;
of the project implementation plan in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;

IMPROVEMENT TO FINANCIAL REPORTING AND AUDITING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
'GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN&#13;
VISION STATEMENT FOR FrNANCIAL REPORTING AND AUDITING&#13;
Draft Prepared by PAD&#13;
1.       As Pakistan proceeds to open up its economy and free it from regulatory controls, the&#13;
need for good governance and modem financial management becomes paramount. Instead of direct&#13;
intervention, the Government has to design appropriate fiscal and monetary responses to changing&#13;
conditions, while in the context of a global economy, issues of transparency and accountabilitv&#13;
have become even more important. In this environment, the synergy of greater public-private sector&#13;
partnership has to be eXploited to accelerate and enhance the development process.&#13;
2.        The effectiveness and credibility of government policies is critically dependent on the&#13;
availability of timely and accurate financial and management information, the existence of a cadre&#13;
of competent professionals in the public and private sectors, a framework of financial and&#13;
accounting principles and procedures designed according to internationally accepted standards, and&#13;
a system of public accountability that includes a strong and independent legislative audit function.&#13;
3.        As part of its vision the Governnent intends to separate its accounting and auditing&#13;

IMPROVEMFNT TO FINANCIAL REPORTING AND AUDITING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK FOR ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS CONSULTANTS&#13;
The project will finance consultancies. computer hardware, software and training&#13;
required for the preparation of revised accounting standards and reporting framework, and the&#13;
design, development and implementation of elected high priority financial application systems at&#13;
selected sites. These application systems include a Core Accounting and Reporting System, a&#13;
Payroll and Pension System and a Cash Forecasting System.&#13;
2.           The first phase of the systems consultancy would thus be directed towards the&#13;
following objectives:&#13;
a) revision of accounting principles and standards to meet, as far as considered practicable,&#13;
with International Accounting Standards:&#13;
b) revision of the financial reporting and accounts classification;&#13;
c) reclassification of the chart of accounts to closely reflect users' financial needs;&#13;
d) definition of reporting responsibilities between PAD and executive agencies;&#13;
e) definition of key information for trend analvsis of expenditure and revenue, and cash flow&#13;
forecasting systems; and&#13;
f) establishment of procedures for coordination and integration of all financial information.&#13;
Particular attention would be given to PAD's requirements for receiving financial&#13;
infornation from other departments/agencies to feed into the accounting and reporting&#13;
system, enabling PAD to produce reports which fulfill the financial information needs of&#13;
the government (and particularly the MOF) completely.&#13;
3.           The scope of work for the remaining phases of the Information Systems&#13;
Consultants would include:&#13;
a) Preparation of the detailed functional design for the specified svstems: This would&#13;
include: i) analysis of the functional processes including administrative procedures,&#13;
transaction documents. forms and information flows, data flow statistics, related to the&#13;
accounting and reporting, payroll. pension and cash management areas currently in use&#13;
and/or recommended by the project consultancies; ii) developing and defining a new&#13;
set of functional processes, informnation flows, procedures. transaction types and&#13;
associated documents and torms. and related structures required to set up the new&#13;
sy stemis: aLnd iii) developing, a full ftrncLiotial design for the computer svstems required.&#13;
including tlle specitication ot the outputs reports. the input formats. transaction&#13;
Llocurnents. processini ancd controls for the systems required at various nodes of the&#13;
intormatioii tlow network. the interfaces Lnd data flows between these nodes and with&#13;
external svstems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
ANNEX'&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
b) Specification of the technologzy architecture required for the implementation of these&#13;
systems: Thlis activity would include the development of specifications for the H/W&#13;
and S/W to be installed at the various nodes and the mode of interconnection of this&#13;
l-lardware and Software.&#13;
c) lnvestigation of altematives for application software: This would entail investigating&#13;
and ascertaining whether one or more off the shelf software packages are available&#13;
which can meet the functional requirements of one or more of the systems, as defined&#13;
above.&#13;
d) Procurement of H/W and S/W: Project consultants will incorporate the Hardware and&#13;
Software specifications into an RFP for procurement, develop criteria for the evaluation&#13;
of vendor proposals; assist the govemment in the tendering process, in evaluating&#13;
vendor proposals, in the acquisition of the hardware and software, monitoring the&#13;
installation and carrying out qualitv assurance during the testing of the hardware and&#13;
software procured for the project. In the event of a suitable package being identified,&#13;
project consultants would develop terms of reference for a turn key project for&#13;
acquisition and installation of the package (including any customization required) and&#13;
acquisition and installation of suitable hardware and software using International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB). In the event of no suitable package being identified, the&#13;
hardware and svstems software would be acquired through intemational competitive&#13;
bidding and the development of the software and related documentation would be&#13;
contracted out to a local software house. In both cases the supervision of the software&#13;
customization/ development and implementation of the systems at the first few (4-5)&#13;
sites would be the responsibility of the consultants selected for preparing the systems&#13;
design.&#13;
e) Svstems implementation: The Core information systems defined above will be&#13;
implemented in a phased manner. In the first phase the systems will be implemented at&#13;
the AGPR Head Office, at an Accountant General's (AG) Office at a provincial&#13;
headquarters, and at two District Accounts offices (DAOs) reporting to this AG. This is&#13;
referred to as the Pilot implementation. In the second phase the systems will be&#13;
replicated over the course of this project to a total of 21 sites including all Provincial&#13;
AG offices in Sindh. Punjab, NWFP and Baluchistan, and selected DAOs within each&#13;
province. Systems implementation wvill involve: (i) preparation of an implementation&#13;
schedule, (ii) installation and testing of the hardware and systems software. DBMS, and&#13;
Application Development tools etc.; (iii) installation and testing of the application&#13;
systems and training end users; and (iv) preparation of related technical and end user&#13;
documentation. Replication of the system would involve preparation of a replication&#13;
plan and schedule for the system for all designated sites. including a check list detailing&#13;
tasks that need to be unldertaken for replication of the system at  , tepical provincial or&#13;
district sitc. %%orkiin closelv with the H.-W. S/W venidor to ensure that the replications&#13;
aire operauional and training of sufficiellt :ocal staff capable of carrying out subsequent&#13;
replicatiolls.&#13;

IMPROVEMENT TO FINANCIAL REPORTING AND AUDITING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE FOR GOVERNMENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
A.    Information Systems Architecture&#13;
1.           Figure I shows the overall Inforrnation Systems Architecture for Government Fiscal&#13;
Management in Pakistan. This architecture showvs the major functional processes required to be&#13;
carried out as part of government fiscal management. the agencies associated with these processes,&#13;
the complete suite of information systems required by these agencies to perform these functions and&#13;
the major data flows between the systems. The high priority information systems. identified by the&#13;
diagnostic consultancv as being critical for the governments financial information needs are&#13;
indicated by the shaded boxes in this diagram. A brief description of these application systems&#13;
which have been selected for implementation under this project is given below.&#13;
a)    Core Accounting and Reporting System: The Core Accounting and Reporting System will&#13;
provide an integrated government wide accounting function and will encompass the&#13;
functional requirements for the budget execution and accounting processes and would cover&#13;
the appropriation, commitment, funds allocation, and payment processes for both the&#13;
investment and current budgets.&#13;
This system would be the core financial management inforrnation svstem of the&#13;
Government of Pakistan. It will be used by: i) the Pakistan Audit Department (including&#13;
its subordinate units) to perform the basic accounting functions: ii) the Federal Ministry of&#13;
Finance and the Provincial Finance Departments to perform the processes associated with&#13;
budget execution, monitoring and control: iii) the Ministry of Finance to provide the&#13;
information it requires for cash management and to implement cash limits, as may be&#13;
required; and iv) the Federal Planning Division and the Provincial Planning Departments to&#13;
obtain the status of actual expenditures on ongoing programs and projects.&#13;
The information contained in the system data bases would provide the MOF and other core&#13;
financial agencies a foundation for a comprehensive management information related to the&#13;
country's financial resources. The information contained in the data bases would be&#13;
available to other governmnent agencies on an as required/approved basis. In addition, the&#13;
system would provide useful financial information to the ministries, spending units (in their&#13;
respective areas) to enable them to better manage their work programs. It will give these&#13;
departments the facilities to down load relevant and authorized data and perform required&#13;
analy ses.&#13;
1he system x \il[ be desiunied in accordance with internationally accepted accountings&#13;
principles and standards it will be based on a double entrv accounting model. Such a&#13;
svstem would need to be comprehensive in terms of coverage and be a source of reliable&#13;
and timelv data to become a credible source ot inforrnation for users. The Core Accounting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
ANNEX4&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
System will therefore be a ftillly automated system. with data captured only once as an&#13;
accounting transaction progresses throughl tile system. This system, introduced along with a&#13;
modem budget classification system and aln appropriate chart of accounts, would enable&#13;
expenditures and revenues to be recorded at a detailed level and related to specific programs&#13;
and projects.  Data recorded at this level will then be directly available for use bv&#13;
arencies/spending units for program and project management. This data will also be easily&#13;
amenable to cross classification for financial and economic analyses. The introduction of&#13;
an automated accounting system would ensure completeness of data capture (that is no&#13;
transaction would be processed outside the svstem) and rigorous application of all relevant&#13;
financial controls to all transactions processed by the system.&#13;
The System would have interfaces with external data sources on a periodic basis.&#13;
Establishing such an interface will ensure that financial data in the system data bases has the&#13;
coverage necessary to provide a comprehensive financial picture for the Government of&#13;
Pakistan.    ,&#13;
b)    Pavroll and Pension Svstems: The payroll of government employees constitutes a large&#13;
portion of the government expenditures. The need for an automated Payroll and Pension&#13;
System is evident in view of the increasing volume of transactions. The proposed payroll&#13;
and pension system will perform the full range of both the payroll and pension functions as&#13;
an integrated system and the payments processed will automatically update the accounting&#13;
data in the Core Accounting and Reporting System. The system will be designed to&#13;
incorporate government rules and regulations related to the payroll and pension functions.&#13;
c)     Cash Flow  Forecasting and Financial Analysis System:  One of the MOF's main&#13;
inforrnation needs is to establish a cash forecasting system for forecasting likely flows of&#13;
expenditure and receipts and the consequent impact on cash balances and issue of debt&#13;
instruments. The Cash flow and Financial analysis system will be designed to provide&#13;
accurate cash balances for the MOF to perform its cash forecasting functions.&#13;
B.    Technology Architecture for PAD's Core Information Systems&#13;
2.                  The technology architecture for the project specifies the nature size and&#13;
distribution of the computer processing facilities and associated work stations; the nature of the&#13;
communications connections between the nodes of the network; and the nature and type of&#13;
application development. svstems software and Data Base Management Systems (DBMS), that&#13;
should be employed for the project. This architecture is determined by the characteristics of the&#13;
application systems for government accounting which may be summarized as follows:&#13;
a)    the application systems for government accounting wiil consist of several modules that need&#13;
t) exchanue data wx-ith each ollher:&#13;
b)    some mnodules xx ill need tv be implemente' at multiple levels e.g. the AGPR in Islamabad.&#13;
the l'rovincial AG offices and the District Accounts Ot'fices. Data will be generated. stored&#13;
and processed at each level and will need to be transferred between Lhe various levels: and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
ANNEX4&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
c)    the data and transaction volumes will vary by province and district. For the Central AGPR&#13;
site and for some AG offices and District .Accounts Offices they could be quite high.&#13;
3.            Hardware Characteristics:    These  application  characteristics require that a&#13;
distributed architecture be used and computer processing power be located at the various nodes of&#13;
the network (the AGPR office, AG offices, and District Accounts Offices). Where facilities allow&#13;
and data volumes justify it, these nodes should be coinected via telecommunications facilities. In&#13;
the absence of telecommunication facilities data transfer would be via computer compatible media&#13;
(diskettes). The transaction processing and database management required at each node should be&#13;
carried out by the computers installed at these nodes. Summary or detailed data, as required, would&#13;
be transmitted via telecommunications facilities/diskettes to the central computers located at the&#13;
AGPR offices in Islamabad.&#13;
4.            The adxantage of such an architecture is that it distributes computing power,&#13;
commensurate with needs, to different nodes of the network, thereby optimizing usage and making&#13;
it more reliable and less vulnerable to malfunctions at a single central site. In addition, end users at&#13;
Provincial AG and District Accounts Offices would have better control over their technological and&#13;
data resources and this inculcates a sense of ownership for the systems they use. The size and&#13;
distribution of computing power across the various nodes of the network is deternined by the&#13;
volumes of data and transactions that are generated and stored at the various nodes and the volumes&#13;
and frequencies of data that are transmitted betwveen the nodes. Information zathered from&#13;
discussions with PAD has been used to estimate the size and location of computers. This&#13;
information will be progressively refined by the consultants during the preparation phase of the&#13;
project, by undertaking actual surveys to gather data for each site.&#13;
5.            Software Characteristics:    The nature of the application systems requires that&#13;
the same core functionality be available at all nodes of the network. Thus, for example, the core&#13;
finctionality requirements will be similar at all District Accounts Offices. Therefore the sarne&#13;
application software package would need to be replicated at multiple sites. This characteristic&#13;
requires that the application software be scaleable and be able to run on small or large computers&#13;
without major changes. Scaleability can be achieved by choosing a line of computers of varying&#13;
capacities which are fully compatible from the software perspective. However. such a choice&#13;
would restrict further additions to the network to a particular vendor and line of computers.&#13;
Altematively, to avoid these restrictions, the application systems should be developed using&#13;
application development tools and DBMS software that can operate on machines of different sizes&#13;
offered by several vendors. This feature is called software portability. Several application&#13;
development and DBMS packages are available in the market which are both vertically and&#13;
horizontally portable.&#13;
6.           Ideallv. the %%a\ to ensure vertical and horizontal portability and scaIeabilitv at the&#13;
various n(odes of the network is to choose hard%varc and software that subscribes to the OPEN&#13;
systemns conicepts. Ill practice. the environment that comes closest to this concepr is the UTNIX&#13;
environment. ApplicaLtions developed under this en ironment would be able to run. \ith minimum&#13;
changes. on any computer that has a UNIX based operating svstem. Most hardware vendors now&#13;
offer a version of UNIX as an operating systems alternative. The project therefore proposes to use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
ANNE 4&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
UNIX as the operating system environment across the nodes of the network. In addition the&#13;
application development environment chosen will use Fourth Generation Languages (4GLs) and&#13;
Relational Data Base Management Systems (DBM[Ss) and associated development tools, Graphical&#13;
User Interfaces (GUls) to increase application development productivity and offer a user friendly&#13;
environment for data access and usage. This approach strikes a balance between large main frame&#13;
systems which would be cumbersome and expensive and other options which could be under&#13;
powered and not scaleable to sites with a large number of transactions.&#13;
