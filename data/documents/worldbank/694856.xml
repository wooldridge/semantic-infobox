TURKMENISTAN&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
1.1    Country Profile. Turkmenistan, the southernmost republic of the Former Soviet Union (FSU),&#13;
is bordered to the west by the Caspian Sea, to the south by Iran and Afghanistan, to the east by Tajikistan&#13;
and to the north and northeast by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The country gained its independence on&#13;
October 27, 1991. Turkmenistan lies in the midst of two of the largest deserts in the world, the Karakum&#13;
and Kyzyl Kum, and 90% of its land is considered arid. With an area of 488,000 kmi2, it is the fourth&#13;
largest country of the FSU.&#13;
1.2    Turkmenistan is one of the least urbanized of the FSU countries with 45 % of the total population&#13;
in urban areas. The country's small population of 4.5 million people is concentrated in a thin strip of&#13;
land along the foothills of the South and in areas where the land is irrigated. The nation's capital,&#13;
Ashgabat, is the largest urban center with an estimated population of 500,000. Compared to other&#13;
countries of the FSU, Turkmenistan's health indicators are poor. Life expectancy is the lowest (62 for&#13;
males and 69 for females); the infant mortality rate (IMR) is the highest (46/1,000); maternal mortality&#13;
is the fifth highest; fertility rates are relatively high; rates of cardiovascular diseases are extremely high&#13;
and increasing; and respiratory, digestive, infectious and parasitic disease are also among the highest of&#13;
any FSU countries.&#13;
1.3    Turkmenistan's economy is dominated by energy and agriculture. It has 1.3 trillion cubic meters&#13;
of proven and probable natural gas reserves and is the world's fourth largest natural gas producer. It also&#13;
has 1. 1 billion tons of oil reserves. Despite these energy reserves, the economy is still predominantly&#13;
agricultural. Cotton, grains, fruits and vegetables are the major crops. At present, agriculture is&#13;
experiencing low earnings, low yields, low efficiency of water use, and problems of soil quality. Nearly&#13;
50 percent of all irrigated land is defined as suffering problems of high water table, salinity, or both.&#13;
1.4    Water Resources. Turkmenistan is a desert country with average annual rainfall varying between&#13;
90 nmm in Dashkhovuz (the project target area) to nearly 400 mm in the southwest highlands. Agriculture&#13;
is entirely dependent on irrigation and most of Turkmenistan's limited water is used for irrigation. Of&#13;
nearly 25 km3 of water delivered in 1993, about 98 percent was used for irrigated agriculture (this&#13;
includes losses estimated at approximately 50 percent) and the rest for domestic and industrial purposes.&#13;
About 99.5 percent of the water supplied was from surface sources. Reuse in irrigation of drainage water&#13;
from irrigated agriculture and reclaimed municipal wastewater is not practiced in Turkmenistan.&#13;
1.5    Four rivers provide surface water in Turkmenistan. The Amu Darya River, which supplies 90&#13;
percent of the water for all sectors, is the major source of water supplies. Within the country, water is&#13;
further distributed by an extensive network of irrigation canals totalling more than 30,000 km in length,&#13;
the majority of which are open and unlined. Groundwater resources cannot be fully utilized since most&#13;
of the aquifers are relatively deep and remote from the main agricultural consumption areas making the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2                                        Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
costs of extraction and conveyance prohibitive. The amount of groundwater presently utilized is very&#13;
low.&#13;
1.6    Agriculture, a vital component of the Turkmen economy, is constrained by the availability of&#13;
water. Declining soils and water quality/quantity will have significant implication for future agricultural&#13;
development possibly thwarting plans to diversify the agricultural base from one almost entirely dependent&#13;
on cotton to one that will enable the country's food requirements to be met. Agricultural regions lying&#13;
close to the Aral Sea will be particularly affected. Improved management of water resources will be&#13;
needed if agriculture is to grow on a sustainable basis' and would include a policy to improve the&#13;
efficiency of water use. Currently there is no appropriate pricing policy for water for any sector. A draft&#13;
Water Law is currently under consideration that would provide the legal basis for charging for water. In&#13;
addition, under the Aral Sea Program-Project 1. 1 (see paras 1.10 and 1. 11) a draft National Water&#13;
Management Strategy has been developed which proposes water pricing for all purposes. Turkmenistan&#13;
has issued a water sector policy letter (Annex A-I) indicating a commitment to water charging for&#13;
beneficiaries of the proposed project. The policy strategy has been further advanced by a Presidential&#13;
Decree (Annex A-2) indicating water charges will be initiated as the project's water supply systems come&#13;
on line.&#13;
1.7    Macroeconomic setting. At independence in 1991, based on expectations of an impending natural&#13;
gas export bonanza, the Government put adjustment and transition issues on hold and launched a plan to&#13;
modernize the capital city. In addition to free health and education, it proclaimed an extensive subsidy&#13;
and entitlement program and strengthened centralized controls. It maintained distorted trade and foreign&#13;
exchange regimes and retained state orders and price controls on many items. Results have been&#13;
disappointing and over 1993-95 real GDP fell by more than 30 percent, gas production declined by three-&#13;
fifths, and real minimum monthly wages by an estimated 80 percent. By the end of 1995, annual&#13;
inflation exceeded 1000 percent and per capita income (US$ 920 in 1995 according to the modified Atlas&#13;
Method) was significantly below the FSU average. However, a serious stabilization initiative was pursued&#13;
during much of 1996 and this made substantial inroads in reducing inflation. There were also a number&#13;
or positive developments in structural and sectoral policies, especially in agriculture. Over the last year,&#13;
the Government has outlined some of the main elements of a reform strategy in a concept document&#13;
issued by the President. It has implemented a number of sectoral reforms and has stated its intention to&#13;
accelerate efforts aimed at macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustment.&#13;
B. Regional Context&#13;
1.8    The Aral Sea Basin. The Aral Sea basin covers an area of 690,000 km2 and is occupied by five&#13;
Central Asian republics, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and&#13;
parts of northern Afghanistan and northeastern Iran. All of Turkmenistan lies in the Aral Sea Basin. The&#13;
Aral Sea, an inland lake fed by the Syr and Amu Darya Rivers, lies between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan&#13;
and was once the fourth largest inland lake in the world. Over the past 35 years, intensive cotton farming&#13;
and agricultural development have diverted so much water from the two rivers which feed the Aral Sea&#13;
that its shore line has retreated by more than 120 kilometers; the sea level has fallen more than 16 meters;&#13;
the surface area has decreased by nearly 50%; the volume diminished more than 70%; and salinity has&#13;
risen to over 30 grams per liter.&#13;

1.9    The quality of ground and surface water resources in the Aral Sea Basin has deteriorated as a&#13;
result of these intensive agricultural water withdrawals combined with industrial and agricultural&#13;
wastewater discharges; soil salinity; and erosion. The ecosystems of the Basin's deltas have suffered&#13;
from spreading desertification, diminishing stream and groundwater levels, and increasing soil salinity.&#13;
Once the location of successful commercial fishing, hunting, navigational and recreational activities, today&#13;
the region in the immediate vicinity of the Aral Sea, including portions of Turkmenistan, is considered&#13;
an environmental disaster zone and all traditional economic activities associated with the Aral Sea are&#13;
terminated.&#13;
1.10    Aral Sea Program. In response to requests for assistance from the five Aral Sea Basin states,&#13;
the World Bank first visited the environmental disaster region of the Aral Sea Basin in September, 1992.&#13;
In partnership with local representatives, the Bank analyzed a range of sectoral problems in the region&#13;
including environmental, economic, agricultural, and health. The five Aral Sea states have worked in&#13;
cooperation with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Environment&#13;
Program (UNEP), and the World Bank to develop a plan of action, the Aral Sea Basin Program, to&#13;
address the problems in the Aral Sea basin. The Bank has taken a leading role in the development and&#13;
implementation of the Program, including donor coordination, technical assistance to all projects, and&#13;
capacity building assistance to regional institutions. One of the three objectives of the Aral Sea Program&#13;
is to ameliorate the conditions for the population in the disaster zone with a focus on the provision of&#13;
improved drinking water supplies.&#13;
1.11   At a meeting of the Heads of Government of the five Aral Sea Basin states in February, 1994,&#13;
it was decided to include the Turkmenistan Water Supply and Sanitation project in the Aral Sea Program.&#13;
Three Water Supply and Sanitation projects for Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, respectively,&#13;
were presented to, and accepted by, the Heads of the Governments of the five Aral Sea States in Paris,&#13;
June, 1994. At this meeting it was decided that the World Bank would take the lead in identifying and&#13;
preparing a water supply and sanitation project focusing on the region of Turkmenistan most affected by&#13;
the Aral Sea disaster, Dashkhovuz Velayet. Additional projects under the Aral Sea Program particularly&#13;
the regional water resource management project were designed to identify the means and mechanisms of&#13;
combining Basin states' development goals/interests with long term water resource and environmental&#13;
management objectives.&#13;
1.12   Dashkhovuz Velayet. Turkmenistan is divided into five administrative regions, "velayet" one of&#13;
which, Dashkhovuz, comprises the Turkmen portion of the Aral Sea disaster zone. The Velayet has an&#13;
average annual rainfall of only 107 mm. As a consequence of its location on the lowest reaches of the&#13;
Amu Darya River in Turkmenistan, the area is the most affected by conditions related to the Aral Sea&#13;
Basin degradation. Dashkhovuz velayet has a population of 951,000 (1996) of whom 300,000 (32%)&#13;
are classified as urban and 651,000 (68%) as rural. The region is characterized by families larger than&#13;
the national average and high population densities. Approximately 50 percent are women and children&#13;
under the age of 14.&#13;
1.13   Dashkhovuz velayet has a capital city, Dashkhovuz City, with a population 154,000, and eight&#13;
administrative zones called "etraps. " The urban population of Dashkhovuz live in the capital and in eight&#13;
etrap centers, "city-type" settlements which are small cities of 10,000 - 32,000 population. Most of the&#13;
rural population live in an estimated 104 collective farms. The farms are further divided into rural&#13;
settlements or villages. There are an estimated 520 villages, or roughly five per collective farm. The&#13;
average collective farm population is about 6,000 and the largest is about 16,000. The average village&#13;
has a population of 1,200. In terms of water supply and sanitation characteristics, only a proportion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4                                         Turkmenistan: Water Supplv and Sanitation Project&#13;
the inhabitants of Dashkhovuz can be classified as urban. The etrap urban centers and collective arms&#13;
both have similar levels of service which are effectively rural in nature.&#13;
1.14   Health Indicators. Health status in Turkmenistan is poor, as compared with other FSU countries&#13;
and health status is poorer in Dashkhovuz velayet than in the rest of the country. The poor and declining&#13;
health is attributed to degradation of the environment; qualitative and quantitative deterioration of the&#13;
drinking water supply; poor sanitation and hygiene practices; protein and vitamin deficiency; and&#13;
inadequate and declining health care services.2&#13;
1.15    The birth rate is higher in Dashkhovuz than in the country, and has been decreasing at a lower&#13;
rate than the rest of the country. The infant mortality rate (IMR) in Dashkhovuz is the highest of any&#13;
etrap in the country (47.5/1,000 live births). Maternal mortality is reported to be more than twice as&#13;
high in Dashkhovuz (96.3/100,000 live births) than in the rest of the country. Malnutrition, anemia and&#13;
goiter are common problems in Dashkhovuz. Local health authorities report that 100 percent of pregnant&#13;
women and 80 percent of women have anemia although no specific studies of malnutrition and anemia&#13;
have been conducted.&#13;
1.16   There is a high incidence of communicable diseases, and particularly water and sanitation related&#13;
diseases such as diarrheal diseases and hepatitis A. Children below age 14 account for about 80 percent&#13;
of registered cases of diarrhea, and 50 to 70 percent of hepatitis A cases. Data about salmonella and food&#13;
poisoning indicate that food-borne diarrhea may be a greater problem than water-borne diarrhea.&#13;
1.17   Socio-economic conditions. Project preparation included a Social Needs Assessment to ensure&#13;
that objectives and interventions would address the actual needs of the affected population and would be&#13;
acceptable to all beneficiaries, especially the poor. The Social Needs Assessment, which was carried out&#13;
in collaboration with local social science experts, included a community profile on overall socio-economic&#13;
conditions in the project area; a survey of 790 households in all project etrap centers and fourteen&#13;
collective farms; and a study of water supply and sanitation facilities in schools, health facilities, and&#13;
enterprises. These activities were conducted in April-May, 1995. Results of the social needs assessment&#13;
were used to: (i) provide baseline information on socio-economic conditions, water supply services,&#13;
hygiene and sanitation practices; (ii) to help identify suitable community based demonstration projects and&#13;
their location; and (iii) to guide project design. The community profile showed that the velayet as a&#13;
whole can be characterized as predominantly rural. The main ethnic group is Turkmens, followed closely&#13;
by Uzbeks, with very small populations of Kazakhs and Russians.&#13;
1.18   The needs assessment revealed that the major concern of the population in the project area is the&#13;
lack of basic food products. Overall both rural and urban households spend about 85 percent of their&#13;
earnings on food. Concerns about the quality of water ranked second as a household concern. Hygiene&#13;
and sanitation related needs are not reported to be priorities. Close to 40 percent of households describe&#13;
the general state of health of their family members as "not very healthy." Average annual household&#13;
income was reported to be $356 ($376 rural and $336 urban) and consists of various components: salaries&#13;
earned by working persons, unemployment benefits, extra earnings from participation in the cotton&#13;
harvest, earnings from the sales of home garden products and privately owned livestock, and income from&#13;
other informal activities. The assessment revealed the importance of income from secondary and informal&#13;

sources to Dashkhovuz households, especially to rural families. In collective farms part of annual income&#13;
is paid in monthly installments, and the rest is paid as an annual bonus at the end of the fiscal year. For&#13;
many rural families, this income system results in considerable uncertainty and financial vulnerability.&#13;
Often monthly salaries are several months in arrears. Because of inflation and fluctuating prices for&#13;
agricultural goods, especially cotton, it is difficult for many households to forecast the amount they can&#13;
expect to be paid by farm management and to plan investments accordingly. Annex B provides more&#13;
information on the needs assessment.&#13;
C. Sectoral Context and Institutional Setting&#13;
1.19   Institutional Setting: Water Supply and Sanitation. Responsibility for the water supply and&#13;
sanitation sectors is shared amongst over nine national organizations (Ministries of Water Resources,&#13;
Agriculture, Environment, Health; Turkmen Geology comrnmittee; Institutes of Design, Chemistry; and&#13;
Housing and Communal Services, Desert Research Institute); regional organizations including the Rural&#13;
Water Department and city departments; and etrap level water and sanitation authorities. Annex C&#13;
provides an institutional assessment including details of sector responsibilities.&#13;
1.20   With some relatively minor differences, Turkmenistan has followed the model of the FSU in&#13;
providing water, wastewater, sanitation and health services to its people. The FSU model was based on&#13;
strong control from Moscow (after independence, Ashgabat) in matters such as policies, planning and&#13;
allocation of financial and other resources; with very limited input from the end-users of the services in&#13;
the villages, towns and cities. The present water and sanitation institutional setting has the following&#13;
weaknesses: (i) allocation of responsibility for the sector among too many government agencies; (ii) a&#13;
wide range of responsibilities other than water and sanitation assigned to the principal agency charged&#13;
with providing water supply; (iii) lack of technical and management skills throughout the sector; (iv) the&#13;
absence of a coherent program for the effective operation and maintenance of water and sanitation&#13;
facilities; (v) inadequate focus on the importance of providing effective means of excreta disposal; (vi)&#13;
inadequacy of funding for both capital construction of new and replacement facilities, and for operation&#13;
and maintenance of existing facilities; and (vii) a national policy which provides water services at no cost&#13;
to the users.&#13;
Organizational Weaknesses&#13;
1.21   Lack of Focus on Sector Responsibilities Housing and Communal Services (HCS), before it was&#13;
disbanded as a ministry, was responsible for the provision of water supply to the people of Turkmenistan.&#13;
Since disbandment, that responsibility has not been represented at the ministerial level. The Ministry of&#13;
Land Reclamation and Water Management (MWR) has the important responsibility of serving as the&#13;
adjudicator of how the country's scarce water resources are to be allocated and it is presently the ministry&#13;
most closely associated with the provision of public water supply. However, MWR has no department&#13;
with responsibility for the public water supply sector. At the velayet level, HCS is responsible for public&#13;
water supply and for wastewater collection and disposal. However, HCS has many other responsibilities,&#13;
and water and wastewater is just one of many communal services in its portfolio.&#13;
1.22.  Gaps in Responsibilities The most obvious gap in sector responsibilities is that for the provision&#13;
of safe and convenient means of excreta disposal. Current analyses of health studies indicate that&#13;
hygienic disposal of human excreta is one of the most critical requirements to assure the health of the&#13;
people. The Housing and Communal Services department is responsible for the provision of piped&#13;
sewerage systems for the disposal of wastewater, but there is only one such system in the entire velayet,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 6                                        Turkmenistan: Water Supplv and Sanitation Project&#13;
in Dashkhovuz City. As no other urban settlement has any significant levels of interior plumbing, there&#13;
is currently no need for other piped sewer systems. HCS also has the responsibility for pumping out&#13;
public latrines, but this is a very limited effort. There are no safe and economic means presently&#13;
available for the sanitary removal and disposal of household excreta wastes. The great majority of the&#13;
people in Dashkhovuz utilize very simple but unhygienic pit latrines, and no organization has&#13;
responsibility for the design, construction or promulgation of adequate latrines, or programs for the&#13;
education of the people in the importance and hygienic use of latrines.&#13;
1.23   Overlapping Responsibilities  Some 68% of the population of Dashkhovuz live in rural areas,&#13;
yet less than half of these people are served by the Rural Water Supply (RWS) department. In other&#13;
velayets, MWR has responsibility for rural water supply.  Even in Dashkhovuz, MWR has the&#13;
responsibility for the construction of rural water systems, while RWS only has operational&#13;
responsibilities. The water systems that RWS operates are very similar to those in the urban settlements,&#13;
yet RWS and H4CS, which operates the urban systems, function independently.&#13;
1.24   National Sector Policy Problems One of the problems with national policy is its failure to assign&#13;
clear responsibility for the water, wastewater and sanitation sector. Another problem is the existing law&#13;
preventing sector utilities from collecting fees for the services they perform. The lack of long term&#13;
planning for the sector is one of the consequences of failure to assign overall sector responsibility to a&#13;
specific government agency. The inadequacies of the existing systems and the large numbers of people&#13;
without adequate water or sanitation services have several causes, but inadequate funding is one of the&#13;
principal ones. National pricing policies and lack of focussed responsibility are among the principal&#13;
causes of the lack of funding.&#13;
Operational Weaknesses&#13;
1.25   Planning and Management There is little evidence of long term planning to overcome existing&#13;
deficiencies. Even the current crisis of providing water only a few hours per day appears to be accepted&#13;
with resignation, though there is evidence that water is being wasted under present procedures in volumes&#13;
which considerably exceed the amounts required to meet the needs of the people 24 hours per day. In&#13;
many tables of organization, far too many departments report to the head of the organization. Systems&#13;
for the accurate collection of financial and technical operating data, and for the distribution of this&#13;
information to managers are inadequate. Realistic budgeting and cost estimating are not practiced at the&#13;
water supply utility level.&#13;
1.26   Operation and Maintenance  The current financial difficulties contribute to severe operational&#13;
problems. Critical parts and supplies are rarely available. Equipment is often cannibalized, and any but&#13;
the simplest of repairs usually must be made in Dashkhovuz City or, more commonly, back in Ashgabat.&#13;
Procurement procedures are centralized and complicated, and operators have little control over obtaining&#13;
the equipment and supplies they require. There is little preventive maintenance, or the tools with which&#13;
to accomplish it. On the other hand, there is often no budget for grease, pump packing , tools or other&#13;
materials and supplies. Operators rarely have copies of the plans and specifications for the works under&#13;
their responsibility, and no operating manuals or guidelines. Almost all the piped water systems in&#13;
Dashkhovuz Velayet utilize water from shallow wells adjacent to irrigation canals. Some problems with&#13;
degraded water quality from these wells result from operation of the wells in a manner that does not&#13;
comply with recommendations from the authorities of the Turkmen Geology Committee's (TGC)&#13;
hydrogeological companies.&#13;
&#13;

1.27   Human Resources   Salaries of employees in the water, sanitation and health sectors in&#13;
Dashkhovuz Velayet are extremely low, particularly in relation to the Capital. For instance, employees&#13;
of the carpet factory in Ashgabat earn twice the pay of a senior engineer in most departments in&#13;
Dashkhovuz, where typical salaries at the senior levels are in the order of less than US$ 20 per month.&#13;
Working conditions are poor, with inadequate vehicles for transport, poor communications and sparsely&#13;
equipped and furnished offices. Training programs are few and generally inappropriate. Training (most&#13;
of it dating back to pre-independence) often seemed to focus on design and advanced technologies rather&#13;
than meeting actual needs.&#13;
1.28   Institutional Setting: Sanitary, Epidemiological, Health Education.  The Sanitary and&#13;
Epidemiological Services (SES) of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industries (MOH) are responsible&#13;
for drinking water quality monitoring for supplies from municipal water supply systems; and for&#13;
sanitation and hygiene surveillance. The SES have major centers in Ashgabat and in the capital cities of&#13;
the five Velayets including Dashkhovuz City, and stations in all etrap centers. SES has the responsibility&#13;
for testing drinking water quality. Water samples are taken from public systems at the point of supply,&#13;
the distribution systems, and selected users, including schools and homes. The frequency and number&#13;
of tests depends upon the size of the system being monitored. Sampling is said to take place once or&#13;
twice a month, on average. SES follow the Russian (GOST) drinking water standards developed by the&#13;
FSU which cover about 28 constituents. SES normally only test for a few of these constituents&#13;
particularly E-coli, salinity, hardness, taste and odor. SES has the authority to levy fines against&#13;
communities which fail to chlorinate and to shut down systems which fail bacteriological tests. Officials&#13;
whose systems frequently fail to meet the standards are subject to criminal prosecution. It appears these&#13;
sanctions are rarely imposed. In Dashkhovuz, the SES have three laboratories in the capital (regional&#13;
bacteriological laboratory, regional chemical laboratory, and city laboratory) and one bacteriological&#13;
laboratory in each etrap center. Annex D provides limited water quality data.&#13;
1.29   The SES have scarce resources. Receiving only 3 percent of the total MOH budget, SES is&#13;
seriously underfunded. As a result of severe budget limitations, SES suffers from buildings of limited&#13;
size and poor quality; shortage of operable vehicles; and laboratories with failing equipment and&#13;
inadequate supplies of chemicals.&#13;
1.30   The Center of Health is a Department of the MOH with branches in each Velayet. With&#13;
responsibility for health promotion and health and hygiene education, they cover a wide range of topic&#13;
in all kinds of institutions (schools, enterprises, polyclinics, hospitals) with the main educational method&#13;
being the lecture. Although Turkmenistan has a strong tradition of health education, presently the&#13;
activities conducted in the country and within Dashkhovuz are very limited due to financial constraints.&#13;
The Dashkhovuz Center of Health is poorly equipped, lacks the most basic supplies such as paper and&#13;
cartridges for a copying machine, and the staff need to be trained in modern methods of health promotion&#13;
and health education.&#13;
1.31   Intersectoral Action and Donor Coordination. Cooperation between the water supply,&#13;
sanitation, health and education sectors is not developed in Dashkhovuz, and, at the national level, the&#13;
donor efforts in the sectors need to be coordinated. An interagency working group was formed on the&#13;
national level to guide project preparation.&#13;
D. The Government's Objectives and Strategy&#13;
1.32   The Government has indicated its intention to advance the development of the water and sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 8                                         Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
sector (Annex A-1) through achieving the following objectives: (i) increased access to potable water and&#13;
improved sanitation facilities in particular those groups living in the most disadvantaged areas; (ii)&#13;
development of the institutions in charge of production and distribution of potable water and sanitation&#13;
services and improvement of their technical and financial capacities; (iii) protection of the environment&#13;
and of public health; and (iv) protection of water resources and their optimum utilization. Key elements&#13;
of the strategy to accomplish these objectives include: (i) restructuring of the institutions charged with&#13;
the delivery of water and sanitation services; (ii) increasing the responsibility and accountability of the&#13;
management of the water sector: (iii) initiation of cost recovery mechanisms including a tariff setting&#13;
policy whereby revenues would cover the full cost of operation, variations in working capital requirement&#13;
and regular preventive measures. The Government intends to initiate the institutional and cost recovery&#13;
reforms in the water sector on a regional level first, followed, depending on progress, by reforms on the&#13;
national water sector level with the objective of improving the effectiveness of the sector throughout the&#13;
country.&#13;
E. The Bank's Strategy&#13;
1.33    The Banks' program has developed slowly but steadily reflecting the limited but growing Bank-&#13;
Government dialogue on development issues and approaches. A Country Economic Memorandum was&#13;
issued May 31, 1994. The first loan was approved by the Board for the Institutional Building/Technical&#13;
Assistance (IB/TA) project in FY95 and the IB/TA loan is now in implementation. A Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy has been prepared, at the request of the Government, for discussion by the Board on May 27,&#13;
1997, together with this project and with the proposed Urban Transport project.  As described in the&#13;
CAS, the Bank's strategy is to proceed in phases based on the evolution of the Government's reform&#13;
effort. The Bank's efforts would emphasize analytical work, technical assistance and policy dialogue to&#13;
assist the Government to remove remaining distortions which could constitute barriers to the transition,&#13;
and to the efficient development of its designed priority sectors which are agriculture, oil and gas, social&#13;
sectors, and infrastructure.&#13;
1.34   The Bank's role in the potable water and sanitation sector is to support the Government efforts&#13;
to improve the water supplies and sanitation facilities in the part of the country most severely affected&#13;
by the consequences of the Aral Sea crisis and which are the most poorly serviced with regard to water&#13;
supply and sanitation; and to strengthen the institutional and policy framework for potable water supply&#13;
and sanitation services. The Bank has responded with the Water Supply and Sanitation Project, as agreed&#13;
during the June 1994 donor conference in Paris.&#13;
F. Bank Experience in the Sector&#13;
1.35   Lessons learned from Bank experience in Turkmenistan, other FSU projects, and the Bank's water&#13;
supply and sanitation portfolio have been incorporated in the design of the Project.&#13;
1.36   Turkmenistan and the FSU.  The IB/TA  project, only project in implementation in&#13;
Turkmenistan, experienced initial delays but currently ratings for development objectives, implementation&#13;
progress and project management are satisfactory. Lessons learned from other FSU projects include (i)&#13;
the need to identify a consistent counterpart team with sufficient authority to move the project forward;&#13;
(ii) the difficulty of coordinating among interested parties, (iii) the importance of early detailed attention&#13;
to procurement and other implementation issues; and (iv) the importance of including local institutes in&#13;
project preparation and design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                         Page 9&#13;
1.37   Water Supply and Sanitation Sector. Major lessons learned from the Bank's past water supply&#13;
and sanitation projects indicate that projects should include the following3: (i) an adequate regulatory&#13;
framework and, linked to it, appropriate tariff levels and billing and collection mechanisms to generate&#13;
the funds needed for financial autonomy and to signal the real cost of water to the consumers; (ii) reversal&#13;
of the preference of decision-makers for new capital expenditure over proper operation and maintenance&#13;
(iii) clear measures to reduce unaccounted-for-water, and (iv) user involvement in the setting of priorities&#13;
to improve ownership and cost-sharing of operation and maintenance functions.&#13;
1.38   The project reflects concern for learning from past experience and reduction of risks. The&#13;
proposed project has been developed through close collaboration with the Turkmen authorities at the&#13;
national and velayet level and concerned sectoral ministries and institutes which will be involved in&#13;
implementation. An interagency working group was formed at project identification and it has been&#13;
involved in project preparation and design. Local social scientists were trained and engaged to conduct&#13;
the Social Needs Assessment. To ensure that the Government assumes greater responsibility for the&#13;
project and develops a sense of ownership and capacity for implementation, the Government fully&#13;
executed the PHRD grant which funded project preparation. All preparation missions have conducted&#13;
workshops for the Government and other stakeholders on Bank operations. The project includes close&#13;
Bank supervision and monitoring and sustained assistance to authorities throughout implementation. A&#13;
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established using a Project Preparation Facility prior to&#13;
appraisal and includes technical assistance. The PIU will include component coordinators representing&#13;
the water supply, sanitation and health implementing agencies, respectively. User involvement has been&#13;
extensive during preparation (para 3.2) and would continue into implementation.&#13;
1.39   One of the project's main components is institutional strengthening of the water and wastewater&#13;
sector. The establishment of a specialized autonomous regional water and wastewater authority is one&#13;
of the major outputs of the Project and capacity building of the water and health sectors at the regional&#13;
level is a primary objective of the Project. The proposed project will assist in training and information&#13;
dissemination through the national institutional strengthening component. The project's physical works&#13;
concentrate on rehabilitation, the minimization of physical and commercial water losses and the correction&#13;
of deferred maintenance as a means of improving efficiency. The project would emphasize strengthening&#13;
of operation and maintenance capacities. The project will initiate water charges in Turkmenistan and,&#13;
through the institutional strengthening component, assist in the development of appropriate tariff levels&#13;
while strengthening the institutional capacity to establish and collect tariffs. Rehabilitation of the supply&#13;
systems, redesigning of the faucets to provide automatic shut-off; and consumer education will reduce&#13;
unaccounted for water.&#13;
G. Donor Coordination&#13;
1.40   The project has been developed in close coordination with other donor activities in the region,&#13;
particularly UNICEF, USAID, and UNDP. To ensure collaborative efforts which build on one another's&#13;
activities, the project identification mission included representatives of UNICEF and USAID. Preparation&#13;
of the project includes a school sanitation demonstration project which was developed by UNICEF staff&#13;
to ensure similarity of strategy and approach. The project's sanitation and health component was&#13;

designed to build on the activities of UNICEF's Aral Sea Project for Environmental and Regional&#13;
Assistance (ASPERA) now in implementation in Dashkhovuz. USAID provided assistance during project&#13;
identification on water quality data analysis and laboratory assessment. USAID has a water supply and&#13;
sanitation project in one of the eight etraps in Dashkhovuz. The project chose the other seven etraps as&#13;
project sites to avoid duplication. The World Bank has assisted the USAID project by supplying water&#13;
tankers through the Immediate Impact Project (IIP). UNDP is implementing a small-scale pilot urban&#13;
water supply project in Ashgabat.&#13;

II. WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION IN DASHKHOVUZ&#13;
A. Water Supply&#13;
2.1     Water Service Levels: Urban Areas.4  All of the etrap centers have a piped water supply which&#13;
delivers water to communal street standpipes. Some households have individual yard taps but this varies&#13;
widely amongst the centers from less than 10 percent to as much as two thirds. Very few residences have&#13;
household connections. The piped systems theoretically serve approximately 108,000 people (75 percent&#13;
of the total population in the seven etrap centers included in the project). However, the existence of these&#13;
systems does not mean actual delivery of safe drinking water.  Due to the enormous losses within the&#13;
systems and the deteriorated conditions of the wells and pumping facilities, the piped system is unable&#13;
to achieve the design pressures and supply volumes. Low pressure in the system leads to the deliberate&#13;
removal of faucets from street standpipes in an effort to facilitate access to the small amount of water&#13;
which arrives. Over pumping of the wells in an effort to compensate for losses in the system leads to&#13;
increased salinity and accelerated depreciation of the pumps. Thus water is delivered only 3-4 hours per&#13;
day, at very low pressures and is not disinfected. Focus group discussions determined that spending two&#13;
hours per day in obtaining water from the piped systems was not uncommon for many families. Those&#13;
who do not depend upon piped water supplies as their primary drinking water source resort to hand dug&#13;
wells (12 percent) and bored wells with hand pumps (7 percent). About 9 percent of urban households&#13;
use water purchased from a vendor as their primary source of drinking water. Approximately 60% of&#13;
the urban schools have a piped drinking water supply. Hand dug wells are the second most common&#13;
source of drinking water (24%).&#13;
2.2     Water Service Levels: Rural Areas.  The most important source of drinking water in rural&#13;
households is wells, often in a neighbor's yard (51 percent hand dug; 35 percent bored). Overall, about&#13;
20 - 30 percent of rural households have access to a functioning piped water system. Water vending is&#13;
non-existent. Currently, only 20,000 people (24% of the total population in the villages of the nine&#13;
kolkhoses in the project) have even limited access to piped supplies. There are virtually no house&#13;
connections in the rural areas. The number of yard connections is unknown. Water delivery is similar&#13;
to that of the etrap centers. There is no inventory of handpumps which are locally made. Based on field&#13;
visits, it was concluded that due to the poor design of the handpump components, the water is unlikely&#13;
to meet bacteriological water quality standards. In some collective farms, surface water (irrigation&#13;
canals, ponds, rivers) is the primary source of drinking water. Household boiling of drinking water for&#13;
disinfection purposes is generally not practiced. Piped water is generally unavailable to rural schools with&#13;
wells being the most conmu-on source of drinking water (51 %) followed by surface water sources (20%)&#13;
usually irrigation ditches. Boiling of school water supplies is practiced sporadically.&#13;
2.3     Water usage for drinking, other domestic purposes, livestock watering and irrigation of vegetable&#13;
4 Information on household water supply and sanitation service levels and use comes from the "Turkmenistan Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
Needs Assessment" (NA) November, 1995. The household survey included 790 households. All of the etrap centers included in the&#13;
project were in the household survey whereas 14 percent of the velayet's 104 collective farms were surveyed. The term "urban" refers to&#13;
the etrap centers and is used to distinguish the centers from the collective farms which are classified as "rural." The etrap centers, however.&#13;
do not show "urban" features and can be considered "rural" in nature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

gardens is determined by the user in accordance with the amount required and relative requirements for&#13;
water quality for each purpose. In general, households switch from piped water and hand pumps to wells&#13;
and surface water bodies to draw water for washing and cleaning. To water their home gardens,&#13;
households use mainly water from surface water sources. However, water for livestock is usually drawn&#13;
from the same source that supplies households with drinking water. In all etrap centers, piped water is&#13;
the main source of water for livestock. The major water quality issue for most consumers appears to be&#13;
the salinity.&#13;
2.4    Piped Systems. The piped water supply systems for both the etrap centers and the kolkhoses use&#13;
shallow wells adjacent to, and hydraulically linked with, an irrigation canal as the water source. These&#13;
wells are typically 10 to 25 m deep, and between 4 and 12 are provided for each system, depending on&#13;
the size of the settlement and the well performance. The water is pumped to a nearby ground reservoir&#13;
where chlorine is intended to be added, but rarely is because of lack of funds or equipment failure. The&#13;
distribution pump station then draws water from the reservoir and pumps directly into the distribution&#13;
system. Quality of the groundwater is highly dependent on the quality of water in the irrigation canals,&#13;
and the principal effect of the shallow aquifer is limited to filtering out suspended solids. This type of&#13;
piped water supply infrastructure is appropriate for the area but is in extremely poor condition. This is&#13;
a consequence partly of inferior construction techniques, and partly of chronic low investment in&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
2.5    Quality of the Water Source. Since much of the irrigation water abstracted from the Amu&#13;
Darya River is returned as drainage water, surface water quality reflects the usage of pesticides and&#13;
fertilizers. Water quality data prior to 1989 indicated excessively high concentrations of pesticide and&#13;
fertilizer residues. However, since independence, the usage of these chemicals has subsided dramatically&#13;
and significant improvement has been documented in water quality. Bacteriologically however the water&#13;
quality continues to be very poor. In 1994, 54 percent of some 6,000 Dashkhovuz water samples failed&#13;
to meet the bacteriological limits of 2 coliform/100 ml. Field investigations conducted during project&#13;
identification found coliforms as high as 60/100 ml reported in SES laboratory records. Salinity is an&#13;
area of potential concern. At present, salinity levels are generally below I g/l (the WHO guideline&#13;
concentration and National Standard), but if the current trends continue, the salinity in some areas may&#13;
reach 1.5 g/l by the year 2000. It should be noted, that the WHO guidelines on salinity are based on&#13;
aesthetic (taste) considerations and not health and there is no epidemiological data indicating a direct&#13;
impact on health for salinities in this range. However the taste may drive users to alternate, less-safe&#13;
(bacteriologically) supplies. Annex D provides water quality data for Dashkhovuz. (Detailed water&#13;
quality data and analysis of water quality laboratories can be found in Project Documents - "Project&#13;
Identification Mission: Background Note, Appendix A Chapters B and C, Assessment of Water Quality&#13;
and Laboratories.)&#13;
2.6    Maintenance Problems. Maintenance of the systems is unsatisfactory. This is a result of a&#13;
combination of factors, including lack of spare parts and chemicals; inadequate funding for vehicles,&#13;
repair tools and equipment; and substandard training.  Very few  of the systems have operating&#13;
chlorination systems, with the result that water is delivered to users with no disinfection. Pumps and&#13;
pump station pipework is usually a mixture of different sizes and types of equipment, much of it&#13;
inoperable, which leads to frequent supply failures. In most towns, water is provided to users only two&#13;
or three times a day, for a total of between 3 to 5 hours per day, and sometimes even less. Often this&#13;
limited supply does not reach consumers at the extremities of the distribution systems.&#13;
2.7    Distribution Piping. The distribution piping systems are also in a poor state of repair, with high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                        Page 13&#13;
leakage rates and frequent breaks. A mixture of pipe materials are used, depending on availability, which&#13;
again gives problems for the operators. The majority of the population are supplied through street&#13;
standpipes, although households with yard taps are not uncommnon. In Dashkhovuz city there are a&#13;
limited number of house connections. Because system operation is usually limited to less than 6 hours&#13;
per day, the street standpipes are either broken or missing, so that a large proportion of the water&#13;
supplied by the system runs to waste. Similarly, yard taps are often left on, and water collected in&#13;
containers, or left to run into gardens. Freezing is sufficiently severe that little water is provided on an&#13;
average of 20 days during colder winter months. The results of a demonstration project in Gubadagh,&#13;
carried out as part of the project preparation, showed that when suitable taps are installed and maintained,&#13;
pressures in other parts of the system increase, improving the overall system performance.&#13;
2.8    Distribution Storage. Storage capacity within the systems is extremely limited. In urban systems&#13;
there is usually no storage apart from the balancing reservoirs provided at the site of the wells and pump&#13;
station. All water is pumped directly into the distribution piping network. The rural systems frequently&#13;
have very small elevated storage tanks in the system, but this usually serves to limit pumping pressures&#13;
only, and provides no useful storage to balance diurnal demand variations, or provide water during&#13;
interruptions in supply.&#13;
2.9    Unaccounted for Water. The level of losses in the urban distribution systems is very high.&#13;
Officials report providing 100-200 liters per capita per day (Ipcd) while observed and reported&#13;
consumption is 15-25 Ipcd. Project preparation consultants estimate only 15% to 25% of the water&#13;
pumped into the systems reaches the users. Much of this extremely high proportion of unaccounted for&#13;
water is believed to result from losses at the standpipes. Since they are not fitted with shut-off valves&#13;
(taps or faucets), they run continuously when the distribution system pumps are operated. Even if the taps&#13;
were repaired, the resulting increases in pressure would likely increase breaks in the distribution piping.&#13;
A significant amount of system rehabilitation as well as new standpipes will be required before pumping&#13;
pressures can be increased to a level which would provide a normal minimum pressure of about ten&#13;
meters in the distribution system. For those users who have yard taps, the intermittent nature of the&#13;
system operation results in the taps often being left open in order to maximize the amount of water they&#13;
receive, and to determine when the water has been turned on. This results in high levels of wastage&#13;
which could only be addressed by providing a continuous supply, and possibly by installing meters.&#13;
2.10   Charges for Water. Neither urban nor rural consumers are charged for water, as a result of a&#13;
Presidential decree which states that water, gas and electricity5 should be provided by the state free of&#13;
charge. There is. therefore, no incentive for those with yard taps or house connections to conserve water,&#13;
or for the remainder of the population to reduce wastage from the street standpipes. Given the present&#13;
inadequacies of the water systems, it would be very difficult to justify any charges at this time but the&#13;
project will initiate cost recovery of operation and maintenance costs as is discussed further in Annex E.&#13;
2.11   Groundwater Sources Within the Velayet of Dashkhovuz. Extensive exploration and research&#13;
has been carried out to determine the availability of groundwater resources for use by the Velayet. There&#13;
are ample groundwater resources in the project area. The restriction to groundwater use is the quality&#13;
of the water, which by different processes and to varying degrees is mineralized and/or polluted. The&#13;
confirmed estimate of availability of good quality (&lt; I g/l salinity) water from the Quartenary alluvium&#13;
is 280.000 m3/day. There are three aquifer levels in the Velayet. One is a shallow aquifer that in some&#13;
5 Up to KWH per month per family member is free, and a very small charge is made for usage above that amount.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 14                                       Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
areas is suitable for use for potable supplies. For the most part, the two deeper aquifers are highly&#13;
mineralized (salinities between 34 and 60 g/l) and unsuitable for use without desalination. The shallow&#13;
aquifer generally is hydraulically linked to the irrigation canals, and in these areas the water, while&#13;
relatively saline, is suitable for use as potable supplies without treatment other than disinfection. Some&#13;
use is made of groundwater from the shallow aquifer in areas remote from the canals, but the quality&#13;
is poor (salinity over 15 g/l), and only limited quantities are available&#13;
2.12   Consideration of Alternative Water Sources. The deterioration in quality of the Amu Darya&#13;
River water in the 1960s and, after independence, political considerations related to the fact that the river&#13;
flows through Uzbekistan at times, resulted in the study and development of alternative water sources for&#13;
the Velayet. Two regional schemes for augmenting water supply sources have been proposed by technical&#13;
organization within the Government as solutions for the water supply problems of the Velayet. The&#13;
schemes are the Tuyamuyun reservoir surface water scheme, and the Balqui aquifer groundwater source&#13;
in the Velayet of Lebat. Extensive investigations have been carried out on both these schemes by local&#13;
organizations, and construction began several years ago on the Tuyamuyun supply scheme. As part of&#13;
the project preparation activities, a detailed review of the two schemes has been carried out and is&#13;
summarized in Annex F.&#13;
2.13   Tuyamuyen Reservoir. The adopted scheme was based on the use of waters from the Tuyamuyun&#13;
and associated reservoirs, which are located within Turkmenistan. Two options considered included (1)&#13;
the use of water directly from Tuyamuyen reservoir, or (2) the use of waters from the Kaparas reservoirs,&#13;
which would then be restricted for potable use only. In either case, a water treatment plant would be&#13;
required which would pump water through a 180 km long pipe line to a storage reservoir near the city&#13;
of Dashkhovuz. Other pump stations and transmission mains would be required to provide water for the&#13;
etrap cities. Work began about 1989. About 90% of the un-lined, un-wrapped steel pipeline has been&#13;
installed, and about 50% of the civil works for the treatment plant has been completed. A lack of funds&#13;
has brought a virtual halt to construction since 1993. There are serious questions about the expected life&#13;
of the completed pipeline, and the quality of civil works completed to date is poor. The estimated cost&#13;
to complete the scheme as originally planned for all urban areas in the Velayet is $515 million. The cost&#13;
just to complete the works needed to supply the city of Dashkhovuz is $215 million. Completion of the&#13;
Tuyamuyen scheme, even if it were within the financial limitations of the proposed project, would not&#13;
meet the objectives of the project in providing improved supplies in both urban and rural areas. The&#13;
majority of the new water would go to Dashkhovuz City, at the expense of the etrap centers. The&#13;
feasibility study concluded that the costs of the scheme are not justified by the improvement in quality.&#13;
2.14   Lebat Balqui Aquifer. There is a major groundwater resource in the neighboring Velayet of&#13;
Lebat, although this would require a pipeline 250 km long to convey the water to Dashkhovuz. Further&#13;
exploration is needed to define the yield of the source, but work carried out to date indicates that only&#13;
a small proportion of this resource has salinity levels of less that 1.5 g/l, considered the maximum&#13;
concentration for a marginally acceptable water supply. The combination of a limited volume of&#13;
marginally acceptable water with the very high cost of transporting it to Dashkhovuz indicates that this&#13;
cannot be considered as a viable source. The estimated cost to transport the water to the city of&#13;
Dashkhovuz is $85 million if the Tuyamuyun-Dashkhovuz pipeline is utilized, or $240 million if the&#13;
water is to be pumped independently to Dashkhovuz. The project feasibility study concluded this is not&#13;
a viable option for the Velayet.&#13;

B. Sanitation&#13;
2.15   Sanitation Service Levels: Urban Areas. Sanitation, as used in the project, refers to the safe&#13;
disposal of excreta. Only Dashkhovuz city has a waterborne sewerage system, and this serves mostly&#13;
high-rise residential housing units, industries and commercial developments that use large volumes of&#13;
water. In the etrap centers, the sole method of sanitation is the basic pit latrine. Temporary latrines are&#13;
those with a temporary hand dug sub-structure (unlined pits 1-2 meters deep) and a temporary super-&#13;
structure. When the pit is full it is closed with soil and the super-structure is shifted. Permanent latrines&#13;
are elevated pit latrines with a permanent super-structure and substructure which can be emptied either&#13;
manually or by truck. The evacuation of the private latrines is the responsibility of the homeowners, and&#13;
generally it is not done. Both types of pit latrines are used in public areas such as schools, markets and&#13;
public buildings, and also in private homes. In urban areas outside of Dashkhovuz City, i.e. the etrap&#13;
centers, 90 percent of urban households have a latrine (37 percent are permanent) typically used by 6-7&#13;
people; the other 10 percent of households rely on public latrines. Emptying public latrines is the&#13;
responsibility of the Department of Housing and Conmmunal Services in the Velayet. To carry out this&#13;
task, they are equipped with pump trucks, tractor trailers, dumpers, and workers. At present, most of&#13;
the required equipment is in disrepair. There is no independent budgetary provision for excreta disposal&#13;
and expenditure is incurred for this purpose from the general budget of street cleaning works. Individual&#13;
home owners either pay privately for emptying their latrines, or else the owner digs a new pit and moves&#13;
the latrine superstructure to the new location. Whether public or private, the latrines are usually poorly&#13;
constructed, most are highly unsanitary, most are without handwashing facilities adjacent to or even near&#13;
the latrine, and soap is not available. All etrap center schools have pit latrines, generally permanent&#13;
latrines, with approximately 100 students/latrine. Observation finds that the latrines are usually very dirty&#13;
and no hand washing facilities are apparent.&#13;
2.16   Sanitation Service Levels: Rural Areas. The situation is similar for the rural areas, apart from&#13;
the fact that there is no authority responsible for emptying the pit latrines. In rural areas 95 percent of&#13;
households have pit latrines: 72 percent of households have temporary latrines, 23 percent have&#13;
permanent latrines. Five percent use communal latrines. For those with "permanent" latrines (those with&#13;
substantial buildings housing the latrine), it is usually the householder's responsibility to arrange for the&#13;
collective farm's transport authority to transport the contents of the pit latrine to designated disposal&#13;
areas, although there appears to be no formal obligation for the collective farms to assist in this way.&#13;
Owners with temporary latrines fill in old pits when they are full, then dig a new pit and move the&#13;
latrine's above-ground enclosure. This is done about once or twice a year. Rural schools are equipped&#13;
with latrines, usually of the permanent type with about 50 students/latrine. Reported hand washing&#13;
facilities are less common than in urban schools, and again, observation finds the latrines to be very dirty.&#13;
2.17   Disposal of Latrine Wastes. Reuse of human waste is not practiced in the region. There are no&#13;
facilities for the proper treatment and disposal of wastes removed from latrines. As there is practically&#13;
no use of flush toilets outside Dashkhovuz Velayet, the wastes to be disposed of are not liquid septage&#13;
but relatively solid material. The present practice is to dispose of such wastes in areas on the fringes of&#13;
the communities where most solid wastes and trash is taken for disposal. Neither the latrine wastes nor&#13;
the solid wastes are covered. There is no effective regulation of this method of disposal of latrine wastes.&#13;
2.18   Disposal of Wastewater. Wastewater is generated only in Dashkhovuz city, which is not a part&#13;
of this project. The collected wastewater is pumped to a location on the edge of the desert, some 10 km&#13;
southwest of the city. About 1980 the wastewater was provided with primary treatment, but that plant&#13;
was abandoned in 1985 after only five years of operation. The wastewater now is pumped to the former&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 16                                       Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
sludge drying beds, which serve as heavily loaded anaerobic lagoons. Flow is believed to be in the order&#13;
of 15,000 m3/day, and any overflow from the rough earth lagoons either seeps into the ground or&#13;
evaporates in the desert.&#13;
2.19   On the household level, most households (78%) pour wastewater into a waste pit in their yard&#13;
or in the vicinity of the house. Some (10%) use sullage to water their garden but sullage is never used&#13;
to water animals. The rest (12%) pour sullage into surface water sources or only streets to reduce dust.&#13;
2.20   Monitoring/Regulation of Sanitation and Hygiene. Hygiene in the project is defined as the&#13;
practice of keeping oneself and one's surroundings clean. The Sanitary-Epidemiological Services (SES)&#13;
of the Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for sanitation and hygiene surveillance, but this function&#13;
seems to have a low priority compared with monitoring water quality. No institution is responsible for&#13;
construction and maintenance of handwashing facilities at public latrines, and SES does not require the&#13;
construction of washing facilities adjacent to latrines.&#13;
C. Health&#13;
2.21   Although much data exists on health conditions in Turkmenistan and in Dashkhovuz velayet,&#13;
health data collection, analysis and reporting are unreliable. Most diagnoses are purely clinical, and are&#13;
not confirmed by laboratory or other tests; autopsies are rarely performed; all data handling is done&#13;
manually, accounting for many errors and data inconsistencies; data is not collected by gender and, as&#13;
for age, only two groups are considered, the under and above 14 years of age. Therefore, data about&#13;
all diseases needs to be interpreted and used cautiously. Results of the Needs Assessment were used to&#13;
check correlation between child (age 0-15) diseases (reported in the survey) and primary source of&#13;
drinking water. Statistically significant correlation was found between (i) intestinal parasites and hand&#13;
pumps as primary drinking water source, and (ii) hepatitis A and surface water as primary drinking water&#13;
source. Like official health data, these results need to be used cautiously. What is certain is that water&#13;
supply, sanitation and hygiene are all very poor in the Velayet and these are factors commonly associated&#13;
with poor health. Annex G provides relevant national and local health data.&#13;
2.22    Factors Contributing to Poor Public Health. Cost effective interventions with an impact on&#13;
health including water quality monitoring and disinfection, breastfeeding, immunization, and treatment&#13;
of diarrheal disease could significantly reduce the burden of communicable diseases in Dashkhovuz&#13;
Velayet but the health services responsible for these interventions have not been able to perform an&#13;
adequate job. An imbalance exists between preventive and curative services. While access to health care&#13;
is universal, the concern for prevention appears to be low. Health promotion and health education are&#13;
very limited. Neither the general populace nor the local health officials make an association between&#13;
sanitation (proper excreta disposal) and personal hygiene with health. Nor do they consider diarrhea an&#13;
important health problem. The general population and health authorities blame environmental factors,&#13;
particularly the physical and chemical quality of the drinking water, as the most important cause of poor&#13;
health. Interest in water quality far exceeds interest in sanitation and hygiene, and concern with water&#13;
hardness and salinity exceeds concern with the bacteriological quality of water, which is extremely poor.&#13;
2.23   Health Education. The Centers of Health are responsible for health education activities. The&#13;
Ministry of Health (MOH) is developing some health education activities, and is collaborating with the&#13;
Ministry of Education in implementing a new health education curriculum that includes sanitation and&#13;
hygiene The MOH and UNICEF have been using health education materials developed by ATTA&#13;
(Assistance to Turkmenistan Association), a local NGO with external support, and some of these concern&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                        Page 17&#13;
hygiene and sanitation. The Centers of Health, however, are severely constrained due to lack of supplies&#13;
and equipment; and training and the impact of their activities is very limited.&#13;
2.24   Constraints to Water and Sanitation Sector Development. Progress in improvements to the&#13;
water and sanitation sector may be limited by the following constraints: (i) the absence of a focussed&#13;
responsibility for the sector at the national level; (ii) the weak enforcement abilities of MOH/SES in&#13;
monitoring the acceptability of water quality, and of the Ministry of Environment in monitoring the&#13;
acceptability of disposal of wastewater, septage and latrine wastes; (iii) most rudimentary requirements&#13;
for a well-managed sector utility are missing; and (iv) the national policy of free drinking water. In the&#13;
absence of the ability to charge users for the services performed, the sector utilities are dependent upon&#13;
grants from the national budget for both capital and operating costs. Since independence, the only&#13;
significant expenditure for new water facilities in Dashkhovuz Velayet has been for the Tuyamuyun water&#13;
transfer project. That project is incomplete and no additional funds have been made available for about&#13;
three years. More critically, funds for operating and maintaining the existing works have been acutely&#13;
inadequate for several years, resulting in the premature loss of benefits from previous investments.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin and Formulation&#13;
3.1    This proposed project forms Component 5.2 of the Aral Sea Program drawn up to address the&#13;
environmental impacts of the Aral Sea crisis. The project was specifically intended to improve the health&#13;
of the population in the region most affected by the Aral Sea disaster by investing in water and sanitation&#13;
infrastructure. The project would be the first infrastructure investment operation in Turkmenistan,&#13;
therefore it was designed to be focused and simple to implement both technically and administratively.&#13;
Project identification and preparation determined that piped water systems, already in place in many parts&#13;
of the region although in a state of disrepair, were appropriate for the region and the service of choice.&#13;
Since the loan amount could not rehabilitate and expand the piped water system for the entire velayet,&#13;
it was decided that the project would focus, in an equitable fashion across the etraps, on under-served&#13;
areas with particular attention to the rural population. Noting significant sector institutional weaknesses&#13;
on the national and regional level, the project was designed to include institutional restructuring and&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
3.2    Participatory Approach. The proposed project incorporates an extensive amount of participation&#13;
by stakeholders at all levels.  During Project preparation, nine workshops were held with project&#13;
stakeholders to discuss the project concept and design, and key project issues including cost recovery,&#13;
reorganization of the water and wastewater sector, community participation components, and project&#13;
implementation arrangements. In these workshops, stakeholders endorsed the project concept and design&#13;
and agreed upon the approaches taken within the project design to address the key issues. Beneficiaries&#13;
indicated willingness to participate on a household and community level in operation and maintenance of&#13;
the water systems and sanitation activities. A Rapid Needs Assessment was conducted during project&#13;
identification followed by a Social Needs Assessment which included 790 household surveys; inventories&#13;
of communal water supply and sanitation facilities; and fourteen focus group discussions. Results were&#13;
used to provide baseline information and guide project development and were presented at Stakeholder&#13;
Workshops. During preparation additional focus group discussions were used routinely to guide two&#13;
demonstration projects conducted under preparation and to provide additional background information.&#13;
Additionally, a local NGO has been actively engaged in project preparation and implemented the&#13;
community components of the two demonstration projects. The demonstration projects successfully&#13;
utilized community based approaches to water supply systems and sanitation and these approaches have&#13;
been incorporated into the project.&#13;
3.3    Project Preparation. The Ministry of Water Resources has undertaken project preparation with&#13;
technical assistance from Electrowatt Engineering. Feasibility work has been financed by a PHRD grant&#13;
of Yen 85.6 million (about US$800,000). The feasibility work included two demonstration projects: the&#13;
installation of effective taps on street standpipes in Gubadagh; and the construction of improved latrines&#13;
and handwashing facilities at a school in Boldumsaz. Results of the street standpipe demonstration form&#13;
the basis for the standpipe rehabilitation component and the development of community involvement in&#13;
operation and maintenance. The results of the sanitation project were used to design the community-&#13;
based school sanitation component, as well as the hygiene and health education activities. Annex H&#13;
describes the demonstration projects in detail.&#13;

B. Objectives&#13;
3.4    The objectives of the proposed project would be to: (i) improve water supply and sanitation in&#13;
seven etrap centers and nine collective farms in Dashkhovuz velayet; and (ii) initiate institutional changes&#13;
in the water and sanitation sector to ensure that the project is financially and technically sustainable.&#13;
C. Description&#13;
3.5    Project Components. The proposed project comprises four main components: (a) water supply&#13;
improvements; (b) sanitation and health; (c) institutional strengthening; and (d) project management and&#13;
construction supervision. The components and their estimated costs are described in the following&#13;
sections.&#13;
3.6    Water Supply Improvements (US$ 20.1 million, or 70 percent of project base cost.) The aim&#13;
of this component is to rehabilitate and expand water systems to seven etrap centers and nine collective&#13;
farms (spread out amongst the etraps), and to provide a supply of spare parts and repair materials to assist&#13;
in operating these systems for the first year after completion. Project identification and preparation&#13;
determined that the piped water systems already in place, although in a state of disrepair, were&#13;
appropriate for the region and the least cost solution for improving drinking water supplies. The&#13;
household survey revealed that piped water systems were the service of choice. Furthermore, from a&#13;
public health perspective the piped water systems offer the best quality water and the opportunity to&#13;
disinfect the public water supply. During project identification it was determined that improvements to&#13;
Dashkhovuz City water supply system would 1) be of such magnitude that there would be little financing&#13;
available for the rural areas; and 2) require major rehabilitation of the wastewater collection and treatment&#13;
facilities. Since the major needs for access to a safe water supply are found outside the capital city, it&#13;
was determined to focus the project on the secondary cities, etrap centers, and rural farms  The three&#13;
subcomponents of the water supply improvements include:&#13;
a.     Urban Water Supply System Improvements Rehabilitation of water facilities in urban&#13;
towns (US$ 8.7 million). This subcomponent will rehabilitate the water supply systems in seven&#13;
etrap centers in the Velayet (Akdepe, Boldumsaz, Gubadagh, Kune-Urgench, Niyazovsk, Tagta&#13;
and Yilanly) from the water source to public street standpipes. No yard or household connections&#13;
would be included. The project would repair existing street standpipes and provide new taps as&#13;
required to provide spacing of about 70 m between taps, which was the Soviet standard. This&#13;
amounts approximately to 3-5 households per standpipe.  The project will include the&#13;
rehabilitation of 26 km of transmission mains with diameters ranging from 400 mm to 250 mm,&#13;
and 211 km of distribution pipework between 300 mm and 100 mm in diameter. The existing&#13;
wellfields will be rehabilitated and new borehole pumps and controls installed. The water&#13;
distribution centers will be renovated, and new electrical systems, mechanical plant, and&#13;
appropriate chlorination equipment will be installed. The present street standpipes will be replaced&#13;
with an improved design that will reduce wastage and freezing during winter months. This&#13;
subcomponent will reduce water losses, reduce operation and maintenance costs, improve water&#13;
quality by reducing the risk of groundwater infiltration to the system, as well as providing&#13;
extended hours of supplying water under pressure to the towns. These improvements will allow&#13;
chlorinated water to be supplied to 108,000 consumers throughout the daytime hours (at least 15&#13;
hours per day, with the goal of 24 hrs/day) instead of the few hours per day that unchlorinated&#13;
water is now available. The component would finance civil works and technical assistance.&#13;

b.     Rural Water Supply System Improvements Rehabilitation and expansion of water supply&#13;
systems in collective farms (US$ 10.4 million). This subcomponent will rehabilitate and expand&#13;
the water supply systems in 47 villages in nine collective farms (Ersarieva, On Yil Abandanlik,&#13;
Bereket (Gubadagh etrap), Maslahat, Shodlik, Magtimguli, Andalip, Kirk-Giz, and Darjalik),&#13;
distributed amongst the seven etraps. Delivery will be through public street standpipes. It will&#13;
include rehabilitation of 64 boreholes in nine wellfields, including installation of new pumps and&#13;
control equipment. A total of 94 km of transmission main will be rehabilitated, and 31 km of new&#13;
mains installed. The seven water distribution centers will be renovated and new mechanical and&#13;
electrical equipment installed. In the distribution systems, 125 km of new mains will be&#13;
constructed, and 2,025 km rehabilitated, along with upgrading of 1,800 existing street standpipes&#13;
and installation of 3,400 new standpipes. This subcomponent will reduce water losses, reduce&#13;
operation and maintenance costs, improve water quality by reducing the risk of groundwater&#13;
infiltration to the system, as well as providing extended hours of supplying water under pressure&#13;
to the collective farms. These improvements will allow chlorinated water to be supplied to 82,000&#13;
people (including 62,000 not previously served by a piped water system) throughout the daytime&#13;
hours (at least 15 hours per day, with the goal of 24 hrs/day) instead of the few hours per day&#13;
that unchlorinated water is now available to only 20,000 people in these collective farms.&#13;
c.     Operational Support Provision of supplies to operate and maintain the water systems&#13;
(US$ 1.0 million). This subcomponent will provide additional spare parts (beyond those provided&#13;
by manufacturers of equipment), tools, chemicals and other equipment which are essential for&#13;
operation and maintenance of the systems. The items provided will include pipe tapping&#13;
equipment, spare pipes and fittings, repair clamps and other spares. Chemicals for two years&#13;
operation will also be provided. This subcomponent will protect the investment in the water&#13;
supply systems by allowing the operators to maintain the systems using the stocks provided until&#13;
normal purchasing channels can be arranged with neighboring countries.&#13;
3.7    Sanitation and Health (US$ 3.4 million or 12% of project base cost). The objective of this&#13;
component is to optimize the project's health benefits by improving sanitation facilities and hygiene&#13;
practices; health promotion and hygiene education; water quality monitoring; and hygiene surveillance.&#13;
The component will utilize the community based approaches to the provision of basic sanitary services&#13;
developed under the school sanitation demonstration project. Since preparation results found low demand&#13;
on the household level for improved sanitation but very poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, this&#13;
component was designed to target under-served, communal facilities and to demonstrate, and educate, with&#13;
strong community participation, to larger audiences the benefits of improved sanitation facilities. It will&#13;
rehabilitate and construct latrines and install handwashing basins in rural schools and markets in the areas&#13;
covered by the project. The three subcomponents include:&#13;
a.    Improvement of Sanitation, Hygiene and Water Supply Facilities Utilizing Communitv-&#13;
Based Approaches (US$ 0.8 million). The objective of this subcomponent is to improve sanitation&#13;
and hygiene. This subcomponent will finance the rehabilitation of latrines and installation of hand-&#13;
washing basins in about 35 schools in the nine collective farms for which water supply&#13;
improvements are being provided, and in one market in each of the etrap centers included in the&#13;
water supply component. The community involvement model developed during the school&#13;
sanitation project will be utilized in the sanitation and hygiene school program. The community&#13;
involvement model developed during the community water supply demonstration project will be&#13;
utilized and further expanded to include community activities in the operation and maintenance&#13;
of the new systems. The subcomponent will be managed by the Department of Housing and&#13;
&#13;

Communal Services assisted by local and foreign sanitation engineers and community development&#13;
specialists. . The component would finance the purchase of one vehicle and equipment for each&#13;
etrap, workshops and local study tours.&#13;
b.     Health Promotion and Hygiene Education in Rural Areas (US$ 0.7 million). This&#13;
subcomponent aims at changing knowledge, attitudes and practices related to water, sanitation and&#13;
health. Health promotion and hygiene education will be carried out in the schools and markets&#13;
covered by subcomponent (a) above, and also in other rural areas. This subcomponent includes&#13;
the rehabilitation of the Dashkhovuz Center of Health. provision of equipment, training of trainers,&#13;
workshops and a study tour.&#13;
c.     Water Quality, Sanitation. Hygiene and Health Services in the Dashkhovuz Velayet (US$&#13;
1.9 million). This subcomponent aims at improving SES capabilities to test water quality , to&#13;
survey sanitation and hygiene conditions, and to conduct environmental epidemiological studies.&#13;
It would improve the performance of the Sanitary and Epidemiological Services (SES) division&#13;
of the Ministry of Health in the Velayet through purchase of equipment and supplies, technical&#13;
assistance, and training. This subcomponent will:&#13;
(i)    Improve water quality monitoring system and sanitation and hygiene surveillance&#13;
systems. Responsibility for this activity would rest with the Dashkhovuz Velayet SES,&#13;
with assistance from local and foreign specialists. This item includes purchase of vehicles&#13;
and equipment, as well as workshops for SES staff.&#13;
(ii)    Upgrade SES laboratories in Dashkhovuz Velayet. The existing 8 SES&#13;
laboratories, one per etrap, will be refurbished and equipment for bacteriological and&#13;
chemical analysis purchased. This subcomponent would finance workshops, training, and&#13;
local and foreign technical assistance.&#13;
(iii)   Improve data collection, analysis and reporting; and conduct epidemiological&#13;
studies. Training will be provided to SES staff in data collection and analysis methods.&#13;
Reporting procedures will be revised. Equipment will be furnished to improve data&#13;
analysis. Technical assistance and training in environmental epidemiology will be&#13;
provided. Epidemiological studies will be conducted as a training vehicle as well as to&#13;
investigate linkages between water and sanitation and health, and to document impacts of&#13;
the project's interventions. This subcomponent would finance technical assistance and&#13;
training from local and foreign epidemiologists and statisticians, workshop training, a&#13;
study tour, and one epidemiological study per year for 5 years.&#13;
3.8   Institutional Strengthening  (US$ 2.4 million, or 8% of project base cost.) The objective of&#13;
this component is to improve the effectiveness of the delivery of water and sanitation services to the&#13;
population of Dashkhovuz Velayet. The component is designed to address the principle sector weaknesses&#13;
which are: (1) allocation of responsibility for the sector among too many governmental agencies, (2) the&#13;
wide range of responsibilities other than water and sanitation assigned to the principal agency charged with&#13;
providing water supply, (3) lack of technical and management skills throughout the sector, (4) the absence&#13;
of a coherent program for the effective operation and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities, (5)&#13;
inadequate focus on the importance of providing effective means of excreta disposal, (6) inadequacy of&#13;
funding for both capital construction of new and replacement facilities, and for operation and maintenance&#13;
of existing facilities, (7) inadequate communication between management and consumers, and (7) a&#13;
&#13;

national policy which provides water and sanitation services at no cost to the users. The Institutional&#13;
development component of the project will finance a two-year program of technical assistance, training&#13;
and equipment to strengthen the capacity of the government to manage, operate and maintain the facilities&#13;
which provide water and sanitation services to the people of Dashkhovuz. The centerpiece of this&#13;
component is the establishment of a Dashkhovuz Regional Water and Wastewater authority (DRWASA).&#13;
Four sub-components for building capacity for the effective provisions of water and sanitation services&#13;
are: (I) identification of national sector reforms; (2) reorganization of the water and wastewater sector in&#13;
Dashkhovuz velayet; (3) strengthening of the newly established DRWASA; and (4) a public awareness&#13;
campaign. Annex C describes these activities in detail.&#13;
a.     National Sector Reform Study. (US$ 0.2 million) The objective of this sub-component&#13;
is to recommend improvements and develop an action plan to strengthen, on the national level.&#13;
the capacity in Turkmenistan to provide water and wastewater services. Technical assistance will&#13;
be provided to conduct a study which will identify the most serious constraints at the national&#13;
level, recommend legislative or other reforms where the national constraints are the most serious&#13;
and recommend a plan of action for transferring responsibility for the sector from the national&#13;
level to Dashkhovuz velayet.&#13;
b.     Establishment of the Dashkhovuz Regional Water and Sanitation Authority. (US$ 1.0&#13;
million) The objective of this sub-component is to establish a specialized regional water supply&#13;
and wastewater authority under the jurisdiction of the Dashkhovuz velayet, which would be&#13;
granted the responsibility and powers to provide sector services to all the people of the Velayet.&#13;
A provisional table of organization for the new regional authority is presented in Annex 1. Results&#13;
of the National Sector Reform study are expected to guide development of the Authority.&#13;
Technical assistance and equipment would be financed to develop: (I) reporting relationships&#13;
between the Authority, Dashkhovuz velayet, and the national government; (2) the legal form of&#13;
the authority (3) transfer procedures for personnel, equipment and responsibilities of the existing&#13;
sector organization to the Authority, (4) new laws and regulations to strengthen the sector; (5)&#13;
sector planning; and (6) a program for strengthening the Authority (to be conducted under the&#13;
following sub-component).&#13;
c.    Institutional strengthening of the Regional Authority. (US$ 1.1 million) The objective of&#13;
this sub-component is to strengthen the capability of the newly established water and wastewater&#13;
authority to meet its responsibilities. The regional and local organizations that would be included&#13;
under the new regional organization have few of the skills or resources required to develop an&#13;
effective utility, e.g. operation and maintenance of facilities; management; collection and&#13;
dissemination of information; finance; administration; personnel; customer relations. This sub-&#13;
component will support the Government in analyzing options for cost recovery and in reaching&#13;
a decision on which option is most suitable.  This sub-component would finance technical&#13;
assistance, training, equipment and supplies.&#13;
d.     Public Awareness Campaign. (US$ 0.1 million) This subcomponent will carry out a&#13;
public awareness campaign to inform the population in the project area about improvements in&#13;
service provision and cost-recovery, as well as to educate the general population about water&#13;
conservation; safe practices for water collection and storage; linkages between water, sanitation&#13;
and health; and the role of the household and community in properly operating and maintaining&#13;
the systems. This last item will be linked with the community development activities for&#13;
community participation in water supply and sanitation systems. Feedback from numerous&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                    Page 23&#13;
community focus groups and stakeholder workshops has found that beneficiaries want more public&#13;
education regarding the new systems so that they can identify specific and appropriate mechanisms&#13;
for their participation.&#13;
3.9    Project Management and Construction Supervision (US$ 3.0 million or 10% of project base&#13;
cost). This component will cover the costs of project management (US$1.9 million) and supervision of&#13;
construction of the water supply improvements (US$1.2 million). Overall project management will be&#13;
provided by personnel in a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which will have personnel in both&#13;
Ashgabat and Dashkhovuz. The construction supervision team will be based in Dashkhovuz. It will&#13;
consist of two full time expatriate foreign construction supervisors for about 20 months, short-term&#13;
construction specialists, about 12 full-time local construction supervisors, and local support staff. The&#13;
details of the Project Management portion of this component are presented in Chapter IV. The project&#13;
implementation plan is presented in Annex J.&#13;
D. Estimated Costs&#13;
3.10   The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$33.7 million equivalent. The estimated cost and&#13;
foreign exchange by components are shown in Table 3.1. Detailed cost estimates by type of expenditure&#13;
are contained in Annex K.&#13;

3.11   Basis of Cost Estimates. Project costs have been estimated in US dollars. Civil works and&#13;
equipment costs have been derived from a detailed feasibility study delivered in November, 1996 during&#13;
preparation of the Project. Cost for consulting services have been derived on the basis of recent cost&#13;
estimates for comparable services in other Bank financed projects in Turkmenistan including training (both&#13;
local and overseas). The costs of consulting services would include, fees, recruitment/relocation costs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

housing, subsistence, and overheads.&#13;
3.12   Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component has been estimated as follows:&#13;
(a) civil works (75%); (b) goods consisting of water supply and sanitation equipment, vehicles, educational&#13;
materials and chemicals (100%), furniture (80%) and local supplies (70%); (c) international consultants&#13;
and studies (100%); (d) overseas training (100%); (e) local consultants (0%); and (1) local training (30%).&#13;
These percentages have been determined assuming that basically all goods (equipment and related&#13;
supplies) would be imported, and that international consultants would be recruited internationally.&#13;
Including contingencies, the resulting foreign exchange component is estimated at US$ 25.2 or 83% of&#13;
total project costs.&#13;
3.13   Contingency Allowances. Price contingencies, representing about 3.6% of the total project cost,&#13;
are based on estimated inflation rates of 2.2% for 1998, 2.6% for 1999, 2.8% for 2000, 2.6% for 2001,&#13;
and 2.5% for 2002. Price contingencies on local costs (expressed in US dollars) are therefore based on&#13;
the same international inflation rates. Physical contingencies were estimated at 15% of civil works and&#13;
equipment, 10% of training and 5% of supplies and materials.&#13;
3.14   Taxes and Duties. All Goods (equipment and related supplies) specifically imported for the&#13;
Project would be exempt from custom duties and taxes. International consultants would be exempt from&#13;
the Government's personal income tax. Civil work contracts would be subject to all applicable local taxes&#13;
which will be paid by the Government as part of their contribution.&#13;
E. Project Financing&#13;
3.15   The total project cost is estimated at US$33.7 million with a foreign exchange component of&#13;
US$25.2 million. The financing plan is shown in Table 3.2 below. The proposed Loan of US$30.3&#13;
million would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs and about 60 percent of local costs&#13;
excluding taxes. The proposed Loan of US$30.3 million would finance about 90% of total project costs&#13;
and the Government would contribute US$3.4 million equivalent or about 10% of total project costs.&#13;

operating costs have been included in the project. Operating costs for operation and maintenance of the&#13;
water systems are discussed in the Economic and Financial Analysis, Annex R. The institutional&#13;
strengthening component will include technical assistance to develop a tariff structure sufficient to recover&#13;
operation and maintenance costs of the new systems, as has been agreed with the Government (Annex A-&#13;
2).&#13;
3.17   The total Government contribution is estimated at US$3.4 million. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtained that the Borrower would deposit its counterpart funds for the Project annually and in&#13;
advance in the project account, establishment of which in a commercial bank is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
F. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.18   Requirements for Environmental Review. For the purposes of the Bank's guideline OD.4.01,&#13;
the project is classified as Category B, which requires only a limited environmental review to determine&#13;
potential negative environmental impacts and suggest mitigation measures as required to overcome any&#13;
identified negative impacts. The required limited review was initiated during project preparation and&#13;
concluded by the preparation team and Bank consultants. The review concluded that the project would&#13;
generate significant environmental benefits with no negative impacts of consequence anticipated.&#13;
3.19   Environmental Consequences of the Project. The project is expected to have a positive impact&#13;
on public health while maintaining or improving quality and quantity of regional water resources.&#13;
Rehabilitation of disinfection systems; leak repair; improved sanitation facilities; and increased water&#13;
delivery periods would reduce levels of bacteriological contamination in the drinking water supplies.&#13;
Currently, operation of well fields often does not follow well field rules (due to malfunctioning&#13;
equipment). Such operation may lead to disruption in the design flow regime and increases the chance&#13;
of drawing water of relatively poor quality. By improving the well field equipment and operation, the&#13;
project would ensure that the highest quality water is delivered.   Technical improvements to the&#13;
distribution system including leak repair and the provision of automatic shut-off valves on public&#13;
standpipes combined with public awareness and education efforts would promote water conservation.&#13;
3.20   The project would have no adverse environmental impacts.  No resettlement, international&#13;
waterways or property rights issues are involved since the project focuses on rehabilitation of existing&#13;
facilities. All works would be executed either within the premises of existing facilities, existing public&#13;
streets or publicly owned property. The project will not affect any archeological or historical sites.&#13;
Contractors will be responsible for notification to authorities of the discovery of any previously unknown&#13;
archeological or historic sites, and the suspension of work until decisions are taken concerning necessary&#13;
steps to protect such sites.&#13;
3.21   Under the terms of the bidding documents, the contractors would be responsible for keeping&#13;
worksites pollution free, returning sites to their original condition, and minimizing dust, noise or other&#13;
work-related nuisances, and for utilizing environmentally sound practices when handling materials and&#13;
chemicals. Water soluble hypochlorite will be used for the water disinfection systems. The two year&#13;
supply of hypochlorite provided under the project will be packaged in non-hazardous small packages and&#13;
containerized as appropriate.  The construction contractor shall conform  with the manufacturers&#13;
recommendations for safe storage and handling of the chemicals. The project includes training in the safe&#13;
handling and storage of chlorination equipment and chemicals.&#13;
&#13;

3.22  The project recognizes that water pollution control of the region's waterways is key to water&#13;
resource management and the sustainability of the drinking water supplies. It is beyond the scope of the&#13;
project to address the causes of water pollution but the public education program will include information&#13;
regarding water pollution control at the household and community levels. Furthermore, it is envisioned&#13;
that future environmental dialogue with the Government will include discussions on water pollution&#13;
control. A National Environmental Action Plan has been discussed and would provide an excellent&#13;
opportunity to advance water pollution control initiatives.&#13;

IV. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Overall Project Management&#13;
4.1    Responsibilities  for Project Implementation  and  Management Responsibility  for the&#13;
implementation of the three major components of the project would rest with the specific implementing&#13;
agencies: the Ministry of Health (MOH) for the Sanitation and Health component, and the Ministry of&#13;
Water Resources (MWR) for the Water Supply and Institutional Strengthening components. The local&#13;
authorities in Dashkhovuz Velayet and the participating etraps will also be assigned responsibilities for&#13;
specific components of the project as appropriate. Overall responsibility for project management would&#13;
rest with a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) which has been established within the MWR. Details of&#13;
the PIU are presented in Annex M. In addition to overall coordination, the PIU would be responsible&#13;
for implementation functions such as project accounting, procurement, disbursements, consolidation of&#13;
quarterly and annual progress reports, annual work programs and budgets. The PIU will also provide&#13;
training and technical assistance coordination, project supervision, and assistance to the Component&#13;
Coordinators (CCs).&#13;
4.2    Organization of the PIU. The PIU will report to the Deputy Minister of the MWR responsible&#13;
for Construction and Operations. The PIU will be staffed with a director (local), an economist/planning&#13;
specialist (local), an accountant/disbursement specialist (local), an interpreter/translator (local), a secretary&#13;
(local), a project management specialist (foreign), and a procurement specialist (foreign). In addition,&#13;
the project will provide a limited number of short-term foreign consultants, including a financial&#13;
specialist. Annex M presents the organization of the PIU.&#13;
4.3    Role of the Foreign Project Management Specialist. The lead foreign specialist will provide&#13;
overall project management support and guidance to the PIU. The specialist's tasks will include an&#13;
emphasis on capacity building, as well as coordination of long-term and short-term technical assistance,&#13;
consolidation of quarterly and annual progress reports, work programs, budgets, and project accounts.&#13;
Contracting of consulting firms to assist with the implementation of the project will be coordinated by&#13;
the PIU and initiated under financing of a Project Preparation Facility (PPF).&#13;
4.4    Assurances were obtained at negotiations that as a condition of Loan Effectiveness, the&#13;
Borrower would have employed consultants to provide the technical assistance services to the PIU for&#13;
project management and construction supervision. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
PIU will be maintained throughout the project implementation period with staffing, funds, facilities, and&#13;
other resources in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
4.5    Preparation of a Project Implementation Manual. A Project Implementation Manual (PIM) will&#13;
be required in order to facilitate the management and implementation of the project. The PIM will&#13;
summarize procedures for monitoring project implementation, processing of withdrawal applications under&#13;
the loan, various methods of procurement to be followed according to the Procurement Schedule in the&#13;
Loan Agreement, use of Statement of Expenditures and overall project funds, procedures for&#13;
replenishment of project special and project accounts. The PIM will be prepared by the foreign project&#13;
management and procurement specialists in the PIU, and will be translated into Russian. The PIU's&#13;
foreign specialists will be required to organize training for the PIU's local staff, and the Component&#13;
Coordinators, in order to ensure an understanding of the procedures specified in the PIM. Submission&#13;
of a satisfactory draft of the PIM to the Bank is a condition of Loan Effectiveness. The Borrower would&#13;
adopt the PIM by December 31, 1997. Between effectiveness and the adoption of the PIM, the Borrower&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

adopt the PIM by December 31, 1997. Between effectiveness and the adoption of the PIM, the Borrower&#13;
would implement the project in accordance with the draft PIM.&#13;
4.6    Project Coordination Committee.  The PIU will be supported by a Project Coordination&#13;
Committee (PCC), already established, whose main task will be to oversee project implementation. The&#13;
PCC will be an inter-ministerial committee to provide policy guidance for the implementation of the&#13;
project. The PCC is chaired by a senior management official in the Cabinet of Ministers (COM).&#13;
Membership in the PCC will include high-level representatives from the COM, the Ministries of Finance&#13;
and Economy, Water Resources, Health, Education, Environment and velayet authorities. The PCC&#13;
would be expected to meet quarterly, or more frequently if necessary. CCs will be invited to participate&#13;
in these meetings and the PIU will serve as the Secretariat of the PCC. The PCC will review and help&#13;
resolve all issues raised during project implementation that cannot be resolved by the responsible&#13;
implementing agencies or the PIU. Assurances were obtained at loan negotiations that the PCC will&#13;
be maintained for the duration of the project.&#13;
B. Component Coordination&#13;
4.7    Appointment and Purpose of Component Coordinators.  The implementing agencies have&#13;
appointed Component Coordinators (CCs) at the velayet level to assist the in managing the project. The&#13;
CCs will work under the direction of a Regional Component Coordinator (RCC), who will also be linked&#13;
to the Dashkhovuz Velayet. The RCC and the CC responsible for coordinating construction supervision&#13;
of the water supply component of the project have been appointed by the MWR. The two CCs&#13;
responsible for coordinating the health and sanitation component of the project will be appointed by the&#13;
MOH, specifically the Sanitary and Epidemiological Services and Center of Health divisions of the&#13;
MOH. In addition to directing the work of all the component coordinators, the RCC will be responsible&#13;
for coordinating the institutional strengthening component of the project. The relationships between the&#13;
CCs and the PIU, and to each other, are shown in the organization chart in Annex M. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at loan negotiations that the RCC and CCs will be maintained with resources and under Terms&#13;
of Reference satisfactory to the Bank for the duration of the project.&#13;
4.8    Overall Role and Training of Component Coordinators. The CCs will be the focal points for&#13;
all project activities related to their components. The CCs will be the first point of contact between their&#13;
respective implementing ministries, the PIU, and the PCC. These arrangements will remove the need&#13;
to create separate structures within each implementing ministry. A project launch workshop with the&#13;
participation of all CCs and key officials of the member ministries of the PCC, to ensure a clear&#13;
understanding of the project, proposed implementation arrangements, and the Bank's procedures and&#13;
practices will be organized immediately after Board Presentation.&#13;
4.9    Duties of the Component Coordinators. With support from technical assistance financed under&#13;
the project, all CCs will be responsible for coordinating the planning and implementation of project&#13;
activities in their respective components. Specifically, the CCs would be responsible for the preparation&#13;
of the annual work programs and budgets, ensure that project accounts and records are maintained, and&#13;
that supporting documentation is kept in an organized manner for the preparation of funding requests&#13;
from the Special Account. In addition, they will be responsible for the preparation of quarterly and&#13;
annual progress reports.  The CCs also would be responsible for coordinating the planning and&#13;
implementation of project activities at the etrap level, consolidating the annual work programs and&#13;
budgets and ensuring that the project financing requirements are incorporated in the velayat budgets&#13;
before they are sent to the PIU, and subsequently to the MOF, during the annual budget preparation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

process. They will also review and consolidate the annual programs and annual reports before they are&#13;
sent to the PIU.&#13;
C. Project Reporting&#13;
4. 10   Work Programs (WPs). Implementation of the project will require the preparation of annual&#13;
work programs and budgets. Separate work programs would be prepared for the components under the&#13;
two implementing ministries. WPs would also be prepared for each participating etrap. The first draft&#13;
WPs would cover the period July through December 1997. Subsequent WPs would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to the Bank by October 31 of each year to coincide with the normal Government budget cycle.&#13;
The draft WPs would be submitted to the Etrap Council as part of the etrap budget for approval. In the&#13;
budget proposals, project activities would be clearly identified and set aside for any follow-up. The WPs&#13;
would be forwarded to the Velayet Administration through the Velayet CCs, who would consolidate all&#13;
the WPs from the etraps. The Velayat Council would then approve the consolidated WPs and forward&#13;
them to the PIU through the CCs.&#13;
4.11   Contents, Submission and Review of Work Programs. The WPs would include the following:&#13;
(1) a statement of the objectives to be pursued for the coming year; (2) an up-dated inventory of all&#13;
works/services to be undertaken during the period; (3) total costs for the budget year for rehabilitation,&#13;
equipment, supplies, and recurrent costs; and (4) conclusions and recommendations of the work program.&#13;
The details of the investment costs included in the work programs would be clearly identified. The PIU&#13;
would review and consolidate the WPs received from the velayet (and etraps) through the MOH and&#13;
MWR CCs. The PIU would be responsible for submitting the consolidated report on WPs and budgets&#13;
to the Ministry of Finance for inclusion in the national budget to ensure that appropriate allocations are&#13;
made for the financing of the share of project recurrent costs that is the responsibility of the&#13;
velayat/etraps.  The WPs would be submitted to the Bank for review and comments at the same time&#13;
they are submitted to the PIU. The Bank would review the WP report and make comments and&#13;
suggestions as appropriate. The consolidated WP would form the basis for the implementation of project&#13;
activities in any given year.&#13;
4.12   Quarterly Progress Reports.  Quarterly progress reports must be prepared by the PIU  and&#13;
presented to the Bank and the PCC. The first report would be issued three months after Loan&#13;
Effectiveness. The reports would include: (1) a summary of project activities by component; (2) a&#13;
description of the main achievements against agreed implementation targets and disbursement schedules,&#13;
and the problems encountered; (3) recommendations on how to solve problems and comments on progress&#13;
in implementing previous recommendations; (4) a description of component activities; (5) a presentation&#13;
of the financial situation of the project in terms of actual versus budget for the major expenditure&#13;
categories and the financing of these categories; and (6) a presentation of the financial situation of each&#13;
component. Each implementing ministry would prepare an annual implementation progress report by&#13;
February 15, 1998 and by the same date each subsequent year, which would then be made available to&#13;
the Bank through the PIU. The quarterly and annual reports would be prepared by the CCs in each&#13;
implementing agency. The reports would be prepared for each etrap, including the etrap city and the&#13;
kolkhos, and would include a summary describing the major achievements and problems. These reports&#13;
would be consolidated by the CCs before being submitted to the PIU for final clearance. The reports&#13;
cleared by the PIU would be forwarded to the Bank. Assurances were obtained during the Loan&#13;
Negotiations that, within one month from the end of each quarter, each implementing ministry would&#13;
prepare such quarterly reports.&#13;
&#13;

4.13   Mid-Term Review. At the time of the estimated mid-point completion of the project, the&#13;
Borrower would be required to undertake a mid-term review of the implementation of the project. This&#13;
review would be undertaken in consultation with, and in a manner satisfactory to, the Bank. By March&#13;
31, 2000, the Borrower would prepare and furnish to the Bank a report regarding the results of the mid-&#13;
term review, including progress achieved in the implementation of the project and measures recommended&#13;
to ensure the achievement of the project's operational and development objectives during the remainder&#13;
of the project life.  By July 31, 2000, the Borrower shall review this report with the Bank.&#13;
D. Project Monitoring&#13;
4.14   Project Monitoring. Project Monitoring would be carried out in five main areas: (1) the&#13;
procurement and physical delivery of goods; (2) the physical implementation of project activities; (3) the&#13;
impact on service delivery; (4) the financial management and control of project funds; and (5) the&#13;
capacity building under the project. A continuous assessment of these activities would be carried out&#13;
under the context of the Project Implementation Plan described in Annex J, and, more specifically, the&#13;
annual work programs. Project implementation programs and the effective utilization of project resources&#13;
would be monitored through well defined Performance Monitoring Indicators similar to those listed in&#13;
Annex 0.&#13;
E. Bank Supervision&#13;
4.15   Bank Supervision. Intensive supervision by the Bank would be required for the first year&#13;
following Loan Effectiveness, principally because the implementing agencies and other responsible&#13;
government agencies lack experience, not only with the Bank, but also with project management and&#13;
procurement methods. Initially, supervision would focus on project management, procurement, project&#13;
financing, Bank disbursement procedures, and methods of payment and reporting. In the second year,&#13;
attention would focus on the institutional and financial aspects of the project. The Supervision Plan in&#13;
Annex N estimates a requirement of 37 staff weeks for the first year of the project (PYI), spread over&#13;
three missions, and 72 staff weeks for eight additional supervision missions, two missions for each&#13;
subsequent year. The Bank's Liaison Officer would participate in important meetings during missions&#13;
and would facilitate day-to-day communications with the PIU. The Performance Monitoring Indicators&#13;
(Annex 0) would be used for measuring progress in project implementation by the Bank's supervision&#13;
missions. Electronic mail would be installed at the PIU to facilitate communication with the Bank in&#13;
Washington.&#13;
F. Procurement&#13;
4.16   Summary of Procurement Procedures. The Project Implementation Unit would be responsible&#13;
for managing procurement for overall project management and coordination. Specialized Procurement&#13;
Consultants would assist the PIU in development of technical specifications. Procurement of civil works,&#13;
goods and services would be in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 and Revised January and August 1996 and "Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated&#13;
August 1981. Standard Bidding Documents and Form of Contracts issued by the Bank would be used as&#13;
appropriate for the Civil Works, Goods and Services to be procuired. Both works and goods would be&#13;
grouped in the most efficient manner possible and the proposed packaging would be reviewed by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

indicating the number of procurement packages, their value and method is presented in Annex P.&#13;
4.17   Procurement of Civil Works (US$24.8 million). Civil works are for the rehabilitation and&#13;
upgrading of facilities (7 etrap centers and 9 collective farms) as well as sanitation facilities and testing&#13;
laboratories in the eight etrap centers. The contractor will supply all necessary equipment. The following&#13;
methods of procurement would be followed:&#13;
(a)    International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be used for contracts&#13;
estimated to cost more than US$ 300,000. Approximately $24.0 million will be procured&#13;
under international competitive bidding. The Government will contribute approximately&#13;
US$2.5 million. Given the size of the contract, the contract will be based upon unit costs&#13;
and the contractor will supply all necessary goods. Given the size of the contract and the&#13;
complexity of works, prequalification will be required.&#13;
(b)    Procurement of Small Works procedures would be used for contracts estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$ 50,000. Approximately $0.5 million for small scale civil works (pit&#13;
latrines) will be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written&#13;
invitation. The Borrower shall use bidding documents developed in the ECA region. The&#13;
invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications,&#13;
the required completion date, and relevant drawings where applicable. Short letters of&#13;
invitation and a brief standard form of contract will be developed and reviewed and&#13;
accepted by the Bank (sample invitation and contract will be included in the PIM). The&#13;
award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the&#13;
required work, and who has the experience and resources to successfully complete the&#13;
contract.&#13;
4.18   Procurement of Goods (US$2.6 million) consisting of water supply and sanitation equipment and&#13;
related supplies, furniture, and vehicles would be grouped to the extent practical to encourage competitive&#13;
bidding. The following methods of procurement would be followed:&#13;
(a)    International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be used for goods estimated&#13;
to cost US$0.8 million related to contracts estimated to cost more than US$300,000&#13;
equivalent each;&#13;
(b)    International Shopping procedures (IS) would be used for the procurement of goods&#13;
that cannot be grouped in packages above US$300,000. Quotations from at least three&#13;
suppliers from at least two different eligible countries would be required for contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$300,000 and more than US$50,000. An aggregate limit&#13;
of US$1.5 million worth of goods would be procured through IS; and,&#13;
(c)    National Shopping (NS) procedures for contracts up to US$50,000 each would be used&#13;
for locally available, off-the-shelf equipment and furniture items of small value and&#13;
standard specifications up to an aggregate amount of US$0.3 million; three quotations&#13;
would be required.&#13;
&#13;

4.19   Preference for Domestically Manufactured Goods. For contracts for goods, to be awarded on&#13;
the basis of ICB, the Borrower may grant a margin of preference of 15% or the amount of applicable&#13;
customs duties, whichever is lower, to qualified domestic manufacturers of goods in accordance with&#13;
World Bank Procurement Guidelines (January 1995 and Revised January and August 1996).&#13;
4.20   Procurement of Consulting Services (US$4.7 million). Specialists and/or consulting firms&#13;
financed under the Project would be hired in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated August., 1981.&#13;
Consultants will be sought for the sanitation and health component ($1.7 million), the institutional&#13;
strengthening component ($1.7 million), and project management ($1 .3 million - of which $0.3 is technical&#13;
assistance under the PPF). Most of the consultants contracts shall be awarded on the basis of shortlist of&#13;
firms.&#13;
4.21   Training (US$0.4 million). For local and overseas training and study tours financed under the&#13;
Project, the qualifications of candidates along with their course of study, and proposed training institutions&#13;
and costs, and in-country local training courses would be subject to prior review and approval by the&#13;
Bank. Candidates would be selected on the basis of established criteria, to be agreed upon with the Bank&#13;
as part of the annual reviews.&#13;
4.22   Operating Costs (US$1.2 million) will comprise sanitation facilities maintenance, PIU staff&#13;
salaries, utilities, office rent and office operating costs including supplies and equipment. The Bank will&#13;
finance 28% of operating costs and the Government will finance 72% of operating costs over the life of&#13;
the Project.&#13;
4.23   Notification of Business Opportunities. A General Procurement Notice was published in the&#13;
February 16, 1997 edition of the UN publication Development Butsiness and, as appropriate, would be&#13;
updated and published annually thereafter.  For goods to be obtained by ICB, individual bidding&#13;
opportunities would be advertised in Development Business and in a major local newspaper 30 days prior&#13;
to availability of bidding documents and transmitted to potential bidders who expressed interest in bidding&#13;
in response to the published General Procurement Notice. The local advertisement procedure would be&#13;
repeated for all bidding packages utilizing ICB. These advertisements would be in the English language.&#13;
4.24   Project Preparation Facility (PPF). PPF P-3120-TM  in the amount of US$0.43 million was&#13;
signed on November 4, 1996 to help finance the establishment of the PIU. Work includes consulting&#13;
services to the PIU for the preparation of procurement arrangements. Study tours, local training and a&#13;
limited amount of equipment and supplies are also eligible expenses. Procurement of consultants will&#13;
follow Bank Guidelines.&#13;
4.25   Prior Review By the Bank of Procurement Decisions. The documentation for all procurement&#13;
transactions not subject to prior review by the Bank would be subject to ex-post review during the Bank's&#13;
periodic project supervision missions. To ensure compliance with the World Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines, the following procurement actions would be subject to prior Bank review: (a) with respect to&#13;
each contract under international competitive bidding for goods or works estimated to cost the equivalent&#13;
of $300,000 or more; (b) the first two contracts for small works awarded under procurement of small&#13;
works estimated to cost the equivalent of $20,000 or more; and (c) for the first three contracts for goods&#13;
awarded under international shopping, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Appendix I to&#13;
the Guidelines shall apply. The PIM prepared by the PIU (para 4.5) will be submitted to the Bank for&#13;
prior review.&#13;

(a)    Civil Works: Civil works (including repairs to existing facilities and installation of equipment)&#13;
shall be procured using the Standard Bidding Documents, Procurement of Works, January, 1995. All&#13;
prequalifications, bidding documents, evaluation reports, awards and contracts will be subject to prior&#13;
Bank review. For the sanitation rehabilitations (pit latrines) the PIU will use a simplified version of the&#13;
standard bidding documents, developed by ECA region, which would be based on a simplified bill of&#13;
quantities including, inter alia, the method of payment and a form of contract. The PIU would be&#13;
responsible for the evaluation and recommendation of award of contracts. Technical verification of the&#13;
work carried out would also be the responsibility of the PIU in cooperation with the MOH. Prior to award&#13;
the Bank would review the first two rehabilitation contracts for works on sanitation facilities (see para 4.25&#13;
above) and monitor other awards and works on a selective basis during project supervision.&#13;
(b)    Goods: In general, pre-identified master lists of goods, indicating grouping, along with estimates&#13;
of cost and proposed method of procurement would be pre-reviewed by the Bank. Items would be&#13;
grouped to the extent practical to encourage competitive bidding and to permit bulk procurement. Bidding&#13;
documents, evaluations and recommendations of awards for goods procured under ICB and first two&#13;
contracts under IS would be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
(c)    Consultants: The selection of consultant firms and individuals would be in accordance with the&#13;
World Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants (August, 1981). Terms of Reference for all consulting&#13;
assignments would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Terms and conditions of contracts for all&#13;
technical assistance assignments, invitation packages and evaluation reports of assignments costing more&#13;
than US$100,000 each for firms, and US$50,000 each for individual consultants would be subject to prior&#13;
review by the Bank.&#13;
4.26   After award, should any material modifications or waiver of the terms and conditions of a contract&#13;
result in an increase above 15% of the original price, the Bank would reserve the right of prior review&#13;
of such modifications (included would be modifications in contracts for consulting services).&#13;
4.27   General Review: The Bank would monitor procurement activities, contract management, and&#13;
project record-keeping during supervision missions. The Bank would undertake a focussed project launch&#13;
workshop in July, 1997 and a comprehensive mid-term review of project progress; both activities would&#13;
place special emphasis on implementation including procurement matters.&#13;
4.28   Procurement Monitoring and Reporting. The PIU would be responsible for establishing and&#13;
maintaining a computerized procurement monitoring and reporting system acceptable to the Bank. Status&#13;
reports from this system would accompany the PIU's regular quarterly project progress reports sent to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
4.29   Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). There are no plans for a Country&#13;
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) for Turkmenistan. A quick review will be done under the public&#13;
procurement reform initiative under a recently approved IDF grant which is expected to be implemented&#13;
during 1997. In general experience with competitive bidding is limited and close supervision by the Bank&#13;
and the consultants will be exercised.&#13;
G. Disbursements&#13;
4.30   Schedule. The proposed Loan would be disbursed over about six years which includes six months&#13;
for the finalization of accounts and submission of withdrawal applications and other reports. No standard&#13;

4.32   The standard disbursement profile for water supply and sanitation project requires approximately&#13;
32 quarters or 8 years to disburse a Loan. However, since the only major contract which will be&#13;
executed is for four years, the disbursement forecast is based on the ECA disbursements profile. Annex&#13;
Q shows a detailed disbursement forecast of the Loan. Funds disbursed under the PPF would be repaid&#13;
from the proposed Loan Funds after effectiveness. A six year period is shown above as it is expected&#13;
that the Loan will become effective in the first quarter of FY98. The last year of disbursement anticipates&#13;
final disbursements in mid-FY03. The Project's administrative arrangements are already in place and&#13;
operating under the PPF. Procurement actions for civil works have been prepared under the PPF and&#13;
would be ready to initiate upon Loan effectiveness. The disbursement schedule in Table 4.3 allows for&#13;
some lag time in actual disbursements to account for normal delays in preparation and presentation of&#13;
documentation.&#13;
4.33   Statements of Expenditure. Reimbursements would be made on the basis of Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs) for expenditures relating to (1) contracts for goods valued at less than US$ 300,000&#13;
equivalent each with the exception of the first three contracts for goods, awarded on the basis of&#13;
international shopping procedures, and (2) contracts for works individually valued at less than US$&#13;
50,000 equivalent each with the exception of the first two contracts for small works costing the equivalent&#13;
of $20,000 or more. The documentation to support these expenditures would be retained by the PIU,&#13;
the MOH, and the Dashkhovuz Velayat for the respective project activities for at least one year after&#13;
receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement is made. This&#13;
documentation would be made available for review by the external auditors and Bank supervision&#13;
missions. Disbursements for all other items would be made against full documentation and in accordance&#13;
with procurement guidelines. Supervision missions would review documentation retained by the borrower&#13;
in the field. If ineligible expenditures are presented, including those that are not justified by the evidence&#13;
furnished, or amounts in excess of agreed disbursement percentages as financed from the Special Account&#13;
(described in paragraph 4.36), the Bank would have the right to withhold further deposits in the Special&#13;
Account. The Bank may exercise this right until the Borrower has: (1) refunded the amounts involved,&#13;
or (b) if the Bank agrees, submitted evidence of other eligible expenditures that the Bank can use to offset&#13;
the ineligible amounts. The minimum application size for payment directly from the Loan Account or for&#13;
issuance of Special Commitments is 20% of the current Special Account authorized allocation.&#13;
4.34   Certification of Statements of Expenditures. The etrap accountant would submit SOEs to the&#13;
CCs for presentation to the Chief Accountant at the Dashkhovuz Velayat Administration. The latter&#13;
would consolidate the SOEs from the etraps and have them certified by the Hakim of the Etrap&#13;
Administration before they are forwarded to the Hakim of Dashkhovuz Velayat for transmission to the&#13;
PIU. The PIU would provide the official certification for the Bank when requesting the replenishment&#13;
of the Special Account.&#13;
&#13;

4.35   Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the borrower has opened under&#13;
conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in US dollars in the Central Bank in Ashgabat.&#13;
During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation of the Special Account would be limited to US$&#13;
200,000. However, when the aggregate disbursement under the Loan have reached the level of US$ 3.0&#13;
million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of US$ 500.000 by&#13;
submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted at&#13;
least every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate&#13;
supporting documents.&#13;
4.36   Administration of the Special Account. The Special Account has been established in the name&#13;
of the Borrower and would be administered by authorized staff of the PIU.&#13;
4.37   Requirements of the Bank for Local Banking Capacity. The pre-appraisal mission confirmed&#13;
that the Central Bank is capable of meeting the requirements of the Bank with respect to operating and&#13;
maintaining the SA. The Central Bank (1) is financially sound as demonstrated by its latest accounts, as&#13;
audited by an internationally recognized auditing firm; (2) has a significant foreign correspondence&#13;
network covering all major currencies; (3) has reasonable capacity and experience for issuing letters of&#13;
credit, for making direct foreign payments and other international transactions with appropriate&#13;
arrangements for the training and development of its staff; (4) is capable of performing a wide range of&#13;
local banking services, including cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks, issuance of debit&#13;
notes, application of conversion rates from foreign currencies, and maintenance of adequate accounts for&#13;
the SA; (5) is a member of Swift and uses or plans to use this facility to expedite payment transfers; (6)&#13;
is willing to issue a Comfort Letter to assure the amounts deposited in the SA would not be set off or&#13;
otherwise seized or attached to satisfy amounts due to the Bank by the Borrower; (7) is willing to&#13;
maintain adequate accounts as required by the Bank and to provide to the Bank monthly bank statements&#13;
and any other information considered necessary by the Bank (copies of all transactions would be routinely&#13;
submitted to the implementing agencies); and (8) is willing to charge reasonable rates for its services and&#13;
pay reasonable interest on balances held from time to time.&#13;
H. Project Accounts, Budgets and Audits&#13;
4.38   Project Accounts and Budgets. Financing of project activities would proceed through a Project&#13;
Account (PA) to be opened by the PIU, through which project funds would be channeled.&#13;
4.39   Accounts and Audits. The Borrower would be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the&#13;
funds provided by the Bank under the Loan, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring that&#13;
audits of the financial statements or reports are submitted to the Bank. The project accountant in the PIU&#13;
would maintain consolidated accounts for the Project and would prepare quarterly financial reports. The&#13;
accounts would be maintained for all project funds, i.e. Loan funds and local contribution.&#13;
4.40   All project records and accounts, including those for the SOEs, the SA, and PA would be audited&#13;
annually in accordance with the "World Bank Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank," (March 1982). An international auditing firm would be appointed to&#13;
perform project audits. The Bank would be provided within six months of the end of each fiscal year&#13;
with an audit report of such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate&#13;
opinion by the auditor on disbursements against certified statement of expenditures.&#13;

V. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Scope of Analysis&#13;
5.1    Introduction. This chapter summarizes the results of the financial and economic analysis of the&#13;
project, which is presented in Annex R. The analysis is divided into four sections: financial analysis;&#13;
fiscal impact and cost recovery; economic analysis; and affordability. These analyses are limited to the&#13;
water supply component, which represents about 70% of the basic project cost. For the purposes of this&#13;
analysis, the water supply project is desegregated into the component for upgrading water supply in the&#13;
seven etrap cities and that for the nine collective farms selected for the project. The analysis considers&#13;
these two groups of beneficiaries separately.&#13;
5.2    With and Without Project Scenarios. The analyses in Annex R are based on a comparison of&#13;
"with project" and "without project" scenarios for the costs and revenues of the water supply services&#13;
in the two groups of beneficiaries. The "without project" scenario supposes that existing inefficiencies&#13;
would continue. The summary of Annex R in this chapter only discusses the "with project" situation.&#13;
B. Financial Analysis&#13;
5.3    System  Inefficiency and the Current Cost of Delivered Water.  All aspects of the water&#13;
systems are in very poor condition. In the existing water systems in the etrap cities and kolkhoses to be&#13;
included in the project, only about 20% of the water produced is utilized by the customers. The water&#13;
estimated to be currently delivered to consumers amounts to only 12 liters per capita per day (Ipcd). The&#13;
resulting operational cost per cubic meter (CM) delivered to customers is $0.59 in the etrap cities and&#13;
$1.03 in the kolkhoses.&#13;
5.4    Inefficient Use of Electricity. The systems use electricity very inefficiently. In the etrap cities,&#13;
a reported 1.43 KWH are used for every cubic meter of water produced. In efficient systems, electricity&#13;
use is in the order of 0.4 KWH/CM. This inefficiency does not result in a financial burden to the water&#13;
utilities because the electricity price is heavily subsidized. However, the real economic cost of these&#13;
wasted resources is considerable.&#13;
5.5    Financial Analysis of Improvements for the Etrap Cities. With the completion of the proposed&#13;
improvements for the etrap cities, delivery of water to customers is expected to rise by a factor of 4.5&#13;
to about 2.9 million m3/year by the year 2000. By the year 2017, consumption is expected to reach about&#13;
6.6 million m3/year. However, operating costs are expected to be reduced by 7% between 1997-2000,&#13;
in spite of the nearly six-fold increase of the volume of water delivered to clients. The average tariff&#13;
necessary fully to cover the total financial costs of the system, or "full cost tariff" is estimated at US$&#13;
0.42 per cubic meter. This is a relatively high rate, largely because of the small size of the etrap cities,&#13;
which makes economies of scale elusive in both production and distribution systems. The cost of water&#13;
is also affected by the high estimated capital costs expected because of difficulties of attracting contractors&#13;
to execute projects in Turkmenistan. A tariff sufficient to cover the full cost of operations and&#13;
maintenance ("O&amp;M Tariff") is US$ 0.14 per cubic meter. This is much lower than the full cost tariff,&#13;
once more pointing out the disproportionate weight of capital costs compared to O&amp;M costs, in the full&#13;
cost tariff.&#13;
5.6    Consideration of Least Cost Alternatives. The proposed plan represents the least-cost solution&#13;
for improving water supply in the seven etrap cities. All other possible plans would still require the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Proiect                                        Page 39&#13;
improvements to the disinfection, storage, transmission, distribution and delivery components of the&#13;
project, which represent about 90% of the total capital cost of the improvements. Any other alternative&#13;
to the proposed supply of water by improving the existing well system would be more costly by a factor&#13;
ranging from the hundreds to the thousands. The proposed principal means of delivery is by street&#13;
faucets, which is also less expensive than providing yard taps or direct house connections.&#13;
5.7    Financial Analysis of Improvements for the Collective Farms. With the completion of the&#13;
proposed improvements for the nine collective farms, piped water would be delivered to a total of 82,000&#13;
people compared to the 20,000 now served. The volume of water expected to be delivered to users&#13;
would be about 1.6 million m3/year in the year 2000. By the year 2017 annual consumption is expected&#13;
to reach about 4.0 million m3/year. The "full cost tariff" for the collective farms is US $0.74 per cubic&#13;
meter. The cost of water is higher than that for the etrap cities because of the lower density of the&#13;
populations. The tariff needed to cover operations and maintenance ("O&amp;M Tariff") for the kolkhos&#13;
component of the project is US$ 0.16 per cubic meter, the same figure reported for the etrap cities.&#13;
Again, the differences between the two projects' costs lie in their capital cost requirements, not in unit&#13;
operating costs. As with the etrap cities, the proposed plan represents the least-cost solution for improving&#13;
water supply in the nine collective farms.&#13;
C. Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery&#13;
5.8    Fiscal Impact. The fiscal impact of the project would depend on the cost recovery mechanisms&#13;
adopted. If the government applies a full cost tariff the fiscal impact of the project would be zero for the&#13;
government. (Potential impact on users is discussed in the section on Affordability.) That is, the users&#13;
would bear the entire burden of the project costs. If an O&amp;M tariff is applied, the net present value of&#13;
the implicit subsidy (the cost of repaying the loan) for the etrap cities would be US $6.4 million over the&#13;
life of the project. For the collective farms, it would be US $7.26 million.&#13;
5.9 Cost Recovery.  The institutional strengthening component of the project would support the&#13;
government in analyzing options for cost recovery, and reaching a decision on which option is most&#13;
suitable for Turkmenistan at this stage. The following cost recovery options could be considered: (a)&#13;
a flat rate user fee (or tax) for all beneficiaries; (b) user fees differentiated between households with and&#13;
without yard taps; and (c) a program to introduce metering for households with yard taps. In the initial&#13;
stage, a metering program is not recommended because of the cost and organizational complexity of this&#13;
basis for a tariff system.&#13;
D. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.10   Types of Benefits Estimated. The analysis concentrates on the private benefits to be derived&#13;
from increased water delivered, improved water quality, and improved reliability of the water supply.&#13;
No attempt is made to quantify possible externalities such as health benefits and increased output due to&#13;
a healthier population. The analysis is based on an estimate of the increase in consumer surplus to be&#13;
derived by households as a result of the reduction in the time they spend carrying water and as a result&#13;
of the increase in their future consumption of water, due to the improved supply. For each type of&#13;
consumer, the average welfare gain was calculated per cubic meter of water consumed .&#13;
5.11   Estimate of Benefits. Separate estimates were made for the gains in welfare from improved&#13;
water supplies for the users of street faucets, yard taps and direct household connections. In each case,&#13;
a linear demand curve was estimated, based on the average amount of time spent per household at present&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 40                                       Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
carrying water, and the average volume carried; the estimated average consumption of unrationed&#13;
households facing a zero marginal price for water with, respectively: a household connection; a yard tap;&#13;
and a street faucet. The analysis reports an economic internal rate of return of 22.2 % for the etrap cities&#13;
project component and 10.6% for the collective farm project component. The latter is below that of the&#13;
etrap city project component because of the higher unit costs of production.&#13;
5.12   Sensitivity Analysis. The results of the financial and economic analysis did not vary significantly&#13;
throughout the probable range of values of the main independent variables.&#13;
E. Affordability&#13;
5.13   Income and Impact of User Fees. According to the government statistical agency, Goskomstat,&#13;
the average household monthly disposable income in Dashkhovuz Velayet in 1995 was 13,600 manats,&#13;
or about $68 per month. The dollar equivalent, however, was based on the then rate of exchange of 200&#13;
manats per dollar, but the current rate (September 1996) is about 4,800 manats per dollar. Incomes&#13;
certainly have not kept pace with this difference in dollar exchange rates, so the $68 per month income&#13;
is not considered realistic in comparisons with late 1996 equivalent dollar income levels. According to&#13;
the Bank's Social Assessment, average household income was under $30 per month in November 1995.&#13;
It is likely that the very rapid depreciation of the exchange rate during 1996 has resulted in a further&#13;
reduction in the dollar value of household incomes, perhaps to about $20 per month. A tariff sufficient&#13;
to cover operations and maintenance costs for a household consuming 9 cubic meters per month (which&#13;
represents a consumption level of about 50 lpcd) would be $1.35. This represents 4.5 % of an income&#13;
of $30/month and 6.8% of an income level of $20/month. These levels are not far removed from the&#13;
rule of thumb indicator that spending about 5-6% of household income on water is generally considered&#13;
affordable.&#13;
5.14   Other Factors Affecting Incomes and Impacts of User Fees. As a first step, it is proposed that&#13;
water charges be levied only against those with yard taps or direct connections to houses and buildings.&#13;
Households with yard taps appear to be more prosperous than families that must depend on street faucets&#13;
or wells for their water, and logic supports that conclusion. Accordingly, the impact on the yard-tap&#13;
households of fees in the order of those described above may be considerably less than indicated. In&#13;
addition, with electricity, health and other typical costs either free or highly subsidized, households should&#13;
be able to spend a higher portion of their disposable income for water than households that must pay the&#13;
full burden of the benefits currently being provided by the government of Turkmenistan.&#13;
5.15   Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Household Income. The proportion of GDP received as&#13;
household disposable incomes is very low. The official data for household income imply a per capita&#13;
annual disposable income which is about 20% of per capita GDP. It appears that most of the GDP is&#13;
retained by the public sector and is used to finance state-controlled investments and to subsidize the&#13;
provision of some food items and free public services (including electricity, gas and water). This in turn&#13;
reflects the slow progress on economic reform and privatization registered since independence. In cases&#13;
where the state retains some 80% of GDP and households dispose of only 20%, there is likely to be&#13;
resistance to paying for public services.&#13;
5.16   Share of GDP Relative to Affordability of Water. In this context, the issue of the affordability&#13;
of water assumes a much broader significance. Policy dialogue with the authorities would emphasize the&#13;
potential efficiency gains to be had from linking the incomes of the bodies responsible for producing&#13;
services to their delivery. The dialogue would also emphasize that the result of privatization would be&#13;

to increase the proportion of total income received by private individuals and lower the proportion&#13;
received by the state. While these issues clearly go well beyond the water sector, in the interim, the&#13;
institutional strengthening component of the project should also aim to show that even with the collection&#13;
of a limited user fee sufficient to contribute to pay for operation and maintenance costs, the efficiency&#13;
of the system's operation can be greatly increased, compared with systems which depend on state budget&#13;
allowances for all their operating revenues.&#13;

VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
6.1 Direct Benefits. The direct benefits of the project would be to provide a safe, reliable water supply&#13;
to 108,000 people in the seven etrap cities and to 82,000 in 47 villages in nine collective farms. 62,000&#13;
people in these collective farms would be receiving water from a piped system for the first time. Other&#13;
direct beneficiaries would be the children in 35 schools in the nine collective farms and people who attend&#13;
the markets in the seven etrap cities that would be provided with new latrines as part of a demonstration&#13;
project.&#13;
6.2 Indirect Benefits. The people of Dashkhovuz would benefit from improvements to the Dashkhovuz&#13;
Center of Health and the health and hygiene education programs to be funded by the project. They would&#13;
also benefit from improvements to enhance the capabilities of the Dashkhovuz office of the MOH/SES&#13;
in such areas as water quality monitoring, and sanitation and hygiene surveillance. The country and the&#13;
velayet would benefit from the demonstration of how to improve water and sanitation services, and be&#13;
able to apply these lessons to serve the remaining people outside the project area. Both nationally and&#13;
regionally, the project would strengthen the water and sanitation sector through reconmmendations for&#13;
reorganization and internal strengthening of the Dashkhovuz Regional Water and Sanitation Authority.&#13;
Finally, the country would benefit from the skills acquired in the management of large development&#13;
projects through the establishment of the project implementation unit.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
6.3 Categories of Risks. The various categories of risks include (a) the willingness of the national&#13;
government to commnit itself to sector reform, including adoption of recommendations for institutional&#13;
reorganization and strengthening, and of a policy of cost recovery for the provision of sector services,&#13;
(b) completion of the project facilities on time and within budget, (c) the establishment of a water and&#13;
sanitation sector utility in Dashkhovuz capable of operating and maintaining the facilities for which they&#13;
are responsible, and (d) the success of changing water users attitudes toward conservation of water and&#13;
willingness to pay for the improved services being provided.&#13;
6.4 Consequences of Risks. Failure to overcome one or two of these risks would threaten the success&#13;
of the project. Should three or four of these risks occur, the project would almost certainly fail. The&#13;
project has several safeguards to mitigate these risks. Dialogue between the government and the Bank&#13;
is ongoing to encourage the government's commitment to sector reform, and the loan agreement&#13;
incorporates specific actions to be accomplished to affirm this commitment. Strong project management,&#13;
which would include a blend of knowledgeable local expertise with the support of experience foreign&#13;
consultants, would be in place at the start of the project. Technicai assistance would be provided to&#13;
assist the government in implementing needed reforms and in strengthening the capability of the regional&#13;
water and sanitation sector organizations in carrying out their responsibilities. This support would be&#13;
made available to both the utility providing the services and the organization responsible for ensuring that&#13;
the services provided meet the government's quality standards. Finally, the project would incorporate&#13;
public education programs to encourage improved water and sanitation practices.&#13;

ANNEX A-1: POLICY LETTER&#13;
December 5, 1996&#13;
Mr. James Wolfensohn&#13;
President&#13;
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
1818 H Street, N.W.&#13;
Washington, D.C.&#13;
Dear Mr. President:&#13;
The Government of Turkmenistan is negotiating with the World Bank a loan in support of a water&#13;
supply and sanitation project designed to improve the living conditions of the population living in the area of&#13;
Turkmenistan most severely impacted by the Aral Sea disaster.&#13;
Despite its desert climate, Turkmenistan has a long history of agriculture and settlement and thus the&#13;
provision of water in adequate supply and good quality has been a major concern from the time of our&#13;
ancestors until the present day. Large irrigation systems of the country most notably the 1400 km Kara Kum&#13;
Canal are indicative of this objective. The negative environmental impacts which Turkmenistan is now&#13;
experiencing as a result of the Aral Sea Basin degradation, have challenged our ability to provide adequate and&#13;
safe drinking water. Therefore, the Government of Turkmenistan has decided to implement a potable water&#13;
supply and sanitation project in the Aral Sea disaster zone of Turkmenistan, Dashkhovuz Velayet.&#13;
The Government finds it necessary to increase water supply coverage and water quality and to ensure&#13;
sustainability of the systems servicing our people living in small towns and collective farms. We intend to&#13;
maximize the health benefits associated with improved water supplies by integrating water, sanitation and&#13;
hygiene education interventions. The Government intends to advance the development of the water and&#13;
sanitation sector through achieving the following objectives:&#13;
Increased access to potable water and improved sanitation facilities in particular those groups living&#13;
in the most disadvantaged areas&#13;
Development of the institutions in charge of production and distribution of potable water and sanitation&#13;
services and improvement of their technical and financial capacities&#13;
Protection of the environment and of public health&#13;
Protection of water resources and their optimum utilization&#13;
With regard to the proposed project, our principal goals in their regional context can be summarized&#13;
as follows:&#13;
Restructuring of the institutions charged with the delivery of water and sanitation services by creating&#13;
a regional specialized water and wastewater authority for Dashkhovuz Velayet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 46                                         Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
Increasing the responsibility and accountability of the management of the water sector&#13;
Initiation of cost recovery mechanisms including a tariff setting policy whereby revenues would cover&#13;
the full cost of operation, variations in working capital requirements and regular preventive maintenance.&#13;
In order to achieve these goals, we commit ourselves to the following:&#13;
Institutional Restructurinp Program&#13;
The Government is prepared to establish a specialized Dashkhovuz Regional Water and Wastewater&#13;
Authority by merging the responsibilities of the numerous organizations currently responsible for parts of the&#13;
sector delivery system. Our ultimate goal is to put into place a system whereby the water utilities would be&#13;
independent and operate in a transparent system of regulation and control.&#13;
Tariff Policy&#13;
Initiating the Project the Government of Turkmenistan is aware that one of the requirements regarding&#13;
water supply projects supported by the Bank, is implementation of cost-recovery mechanisms.  The&#13;
Government of Turkmenistan undertakes to allow for the introduction of charges to beneficiaries of the new&#13;
and rehabilitate water systems. While the water supply systems are being constructed, the institutional&#13;
mechanisms needed to implement operation and maintenance cost recovery will be established within the newly&#13;
formed Dashkhovuz Regional Water and Wastewater Authority. When the newly renovated water supply&#13;
systems are operational, we will take all necessary steps to ensure the collection of fees to cover operation and&#13;
maintenance costs. We will begin by targeting those beneficiaries who have chosen to receive higher levels&#13;
of service, i.e yard standpipes. Furthermore, we shall see to it that the agencies involved in the production and&#13;
distribution of this costly water will take all steps necessary so that costs are minimized. The combination of&#13;
water pricing and technical improvements to the water supply systems is expected to significantly reduce&#13;
wastage of water and lead to increased water conservation efforts.&#13;
In closing we would like to mention that the aforementioned institutional reforms are being carried&#13;
out on a regional level in order to gain experience. Depending on progress, reforms can be carried out in other&#13;
regions of the country with the overriding objective of improving the effectiveness of the sector throughout&#13;
the country.&#13;

ANNEX B. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: NEEDS ASSESSMENT&#13;
1.    In 1994, the Government of the Republic of Turkmenistan requested World Bank assistance for&#13;
improving water supply and sanitation in the velayet of Dashkhovuz, the part of the country most affected&#13;
by the Aral Sea crisis. In preparing an investment to respond to this need, the project designers&#13;
recognized the importance of ensuring that its objectives and interventions would address the actual needs&#13;
of the affected population and would be acceptable to all beneficiaries, especially the poor. As a result,&#13;
the World Bank collaborated closely during the early project preparation activities with local experts to&#13;
carry out a needs assessment, as part of a broader social assessment.&#13;
Country Background&#13;
2.     Turkmenistan is the southernmost Republic situated in the Aral Sea basin. About 90 percent of&#13;
the country's territory consists of sand deserts characterized by an arid climate with very hot summers and&#13;
drastic changes in temperature during the winter. The total population as of January, 1995 was 4.4 million&#13;
people of which 45 percent is urban and 55 percent is rural. The infant mortality rate is the highest&#13;
among FSU countries (46/1000) and life expectancy is the lowest (66 years).  Agriculture is the&#13;
predominant economic activity accounting for 42 percent of employment.&#13;
3.     The main source of water for Turkmenistan is the Amu Darya River. Diversion of the Amu Darya&#13;
River from its inflow to the Aral Sea for expansion of an irrigated cotton monoculture in the Aral Sea&#13;
Basin over 30 years has resulted in severe hydrological and ecological impacts, including ground water&#13;
depletion, soil erosion, soil salinization, and ground and surface water pollution.  Located at the&#13;
downstream reaches of the river, Turkmenistan is amongst the hardest hit of the Aral Sea Basin countries&#13;
by accumulation of contaminants in the river.&#13;
4.     The largest of the five administrative regions or provinces of the country ("Velayets") is&#13;
Dashkhovuz, located in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya. Dashkhovuz, which is largely a cotton&#13;
growing agricultural area, has a population of 907,636 (as of January 1995), of which 70 percent is&#13;
classified as rural. The velayet is divided into eight districts (etraps), each of which has a district center,&#13;
a small city of 10,000 to 30,000 inhabitants. The velayet capital is Dashkhovuz City, with a population&#13;
of 140,000.&#13;
5.     Dashkhovuz is characterized by high population growth (two-three percent), and high infant&#13;
mortality (55/1000). Of all the velayets in Turkmenistan, Dashkhovuz is the most directly and severely&#13;
impacted by the Aral Sea ecological disaster. Environmental degradation, insufficient access to safe&#13;
drinking water, poor sanitation practices and poorly functioning health care facilities have contributed to&#13;
a substantial increase of respiratory and infectious diseases in the last 15 years, and a general degradation&#13;
of public health in the area. Currently, piped water coverage (mostly through public standpipes and yard&#13;
pipes) is about 73 percent in urban and 15 percent in rural areas (see Table 4.12). Other water sources&#13;
used by the population are tankers, dug wells and boreholes equipped with hand and electric pumps, and&#13;
surface water. Water collected from infiltration wells constructed adjacent to the canals is frequently&#13;
contaminated and is distributed without treatment. Intermittent supply further adds to this contamination.&#13;
Excessive water losses occur as a result of inadequate maintenance of pipe systems at both the household&#13;
and community levels. Sanitation coverage is even lower than pipe water coverage, and unhygienic&#13;
disposal of human waste is a major contributor to the high incidence of mortality and morbidity.&#13;

Needs Assessment: Objectives and Methodology&#13;
6.     The importance of considering the needs of populations either directly or indirectly affected by&#13;
a project is increasingly recognized as a general strategy in social development. The basic premise of this&#13;
strategy is that interventions should satisfy the needs and priorities as expressed by the project population.&#13;
Advocates of the needs approach further maintain that project success is determined by: the involvement&#13;
of those it intends to serve in identifying their interests, needs, and priorities; and the extent to which a&#13;
project recognizes, accepts, and is responsive to people's expressed needs. Moreover, there is solid&#13;
evidence demonstrating that no matter who initiates a project, its sustainability is greatly enhanced when&#13;
local needs are addressed and existing social groups and structures are mobilized for implementation.&#13;
7.     The overall objectives of the needs assessment for the Turkmenistan Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
Project were to (I) provide baseline information on socio-economic conditions, water supply, hygiene and&#13;
sanitation practices in the area for consultants engaged in other preparatory research work for the project,&#13;
(2) to help identify suitable locations for planned pilot projects on sanitation methods in schools and for&#13;
standpipe repair, and (3) to help identify the most critical interventions to be undertaken immediately to&#13;
improve the water supply and sanitation situation in the project area.&#13;
8.     The needs assessment was conducted in seven of the eight etraps (districts) of Dashkhovuz velayet&#13;
(velayet). The eighth etrap, Turkmenbashi, was excluded because it is receiving US$ three million in&#13;
assistance for water supply and sanitation from USAID. In each etrap, data was collected in the etrap&#13;
center and in two collective farms. The needs assessment consisted of the following activities:&#13;
A community profile study focusing on overall socio-economic conditions in and around the&#13;
selected communities. Data for this part of the survey was supplied by local administrative bodies&#13;
and management units of collective farms.&#13;
*      A household survey, including 790 households from the 7 etrap centers and the 14 collective&#13;
farms. Local specialists collected household data on demography, income, housing, economic&#13;
activities, problems and needs, water supply, sanitation, and health.&#13;
*      A study of water supply and sanitation facilities ("Institutional Analysis"), in schools, health&#13;
facilities, and enterprises. A team of ten local scientists collected data in all schools (128) and&#13;
health facilities (97) and selected enterprises (74) in the 7 etrap centers and 14 collective farms.&#13;
9.     The needs assessment was the first stage of a broader social assessment, which in addition to the&#13;
activities mentioned above, also included focus group discussions and a stakeholder seminar.&#13;
Main Findings of the Needs Assessment&#13;
10.    The needs assessment revealed clearly that the major concern of the population in the project area&#13;
is the lack of basic food products. Concerns about the quality of water rank second, and water supply&#13;
improvements are considered by many households as a major step towards an improvement of their living&#13;
conditions. Hygiene and sanitation related needs are generally not reported to be priorities by the&#13;
households included in the sample. However, from the limited amount of informnation that could be&#13;
gathered regarding household hygiene and sanitation practices, coupled with observations from the project&#13;
identification mission and surveyors, it appears that hygiene and sanitation practices in the project area&#13;
are rather unsafe. Although this area warrants more study, improvement measures in this sector, such&#13;
as the construction of safe latrines and hand washing facilities are highly recommended.&#13;
&#13;

Socio-economic Information&#13;
11.    A household's income in Dashkhovuz typically consists of various components: salaries earned&#13;
by working persons, unemployment benefits, extra earnings from participation in the annual cotton harvest,&#13;
earnings from the sales of home garden products and privately owned livestock, and income from other&#13;
informal activities, including trade. While earnings from unemployment benefits and home produce sales&#13;
contribute only to a very small extent to total annual income, income from the sales of livestock&#13;
constitutes a substantial share of total annual income for both urban and rural households. Adding&#13;
earnings from all sources, rural households actually earn 12 percent more per year than urban families,&#13;
who receive, on average, higher salaries. Overall, the assessment revealed the importance of income from&#13;
secondary and informal sources to Dashkhovuz households, especially to rural families.&#13;
12.   In rural communities based on the collective farmn system, part of annual income is paid in&#13;
monthly installments, and the rest is paid as an annual "bonus" at the end of the fiscal year. For many&#13;
rural families, this income system results in considerable uncertainty and financial vulnerability. In many&#13;
cases, monthly salaries are several months in arrears, resulting in a loss of real income due to inflation.&#13;
Also, because of the fluctuating prices for many agricultural goods, especially cotton, it is difficult for&#13;
houselholds to forecast the amount they can expect to be paid by the farm management at the end of the&#13;
year, and plan their investments accordingly.&#13;
13.    Overall, households spent close to 85 percent of their earnings on food, with little difference&#13;
between urban and rural areas. The high share of income spent on food by households living in the&#13;
surveyed communities is a clear indicator of high food prices and severe and widespread poverty in the&#13;
project area.&#13;
Water Supply and Water Use&#13;
14.    Around 40-45 percent of all interviewed households have access to piped water. This percentage&#13;
is much lower for rural households than for urban families (10 percent versus 70 percent). In rural&#13;
communities, piped water is available mainly through communal stand pipes, while in etrap centers, most&#13;
households receive piped water through yard pipes. Indoor pipe connections are available to only six&#13;
percent of urban and one percent of rural families. Wells constitute the second most common source of&#13;
drinking water, supplying between 27 and 31 percent of households. The third most common source are&#13;
hand pumps, which are used by 20-21 percent of families. Water vendors and surface water sources play&#13;
only a minor role as drinking water sources. In rural communities, stand pipes are used by over twice&#13;
as many households in summer as in winter. This fact is a result of technical break downs of many rural&#13;
pipe systems during the cold period of the year.&#13;
15.   In general, households switch from piped water and hand pumps to wells and surface water bodies&#13;
to draw water for washing and cleaning. To water their home gardens, households use mainly water from&#13;
surface water sources, such as irrigation canals, rivers, and ponds. On the contrary, water for livestock&#13;
is in most cases drawn from the same source that supplies households with drinking water. In all etrap&#13;
centers, piped water is the main source of water for livestock. Although the measurement of the exact&#13;
amount of water consumed by individual households' livestock was beyond the scope of this study, it can&#13;
be assumed that livestock water consumption increases the average household's water supply needs&#13;
substantially.&#13;
16.    Respondents, in general, consider neither the reliability of their drinking water source nor the&#13;
quality of their drinking water to be better than barely satisfactory. Hand pumps and wells, the most&#13;
common sources of drinking water in rural communities, received slightly higher reliability and water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                         Page 51&#13;
quality ratings than pipe systems and other drinking water sources. While higher reliability ratings for&#13;
non-pipe sources are mainly based on better water availability in hours/day compared to pipe systems,&#13;
higher quality ratings for water from wells and pumps are most likely based on perceived lower saltiness&#13;
of water from these sources, since saltiness is the drinking water feature that most households find the&#13;
least desirable. Only 1.3 percent of all respondents are more worried about bacteria or other carriers of&#13;
illnesses that may be present in their drinking water source than about other undesirable water features.&#13;
17.    Piped water is available for roughly four hours/day to both urban and rural households with pipe&#13;
water access. In comparison, administrative bodies claim that pipe water is supplied for five-seven&#13;
hours/day. This shows either the unreliability of official data on water supply issues or the unawareness&#13;
of water agencies that real water availability is curtailed by substantial water losses in the system.&#13;
Furthernore, less than half of the respondents reported to have received pipe water every day in the last&#13;
month. Both figures indicate clearly the unreliability and intermittency of piped water supply in the&#13;
project area. To increase water availability, all families included in the survey and with access to a pipe&#13;
water system have water storage facilities, with an average storage capacity of 2m3.&#13;
18.    An indoor pipe connection, combined with a waste water facility, is for the majority of households&#13;
(75 percent) the most desirable water system, regardless of the type of water source they are currently&#13;
using. On average, households would be willing to pay a one-time fee of $17, or 5 percent of total annual&#13;
income ($355) for the installation or construction of the water supply system of their choice. In addition,&#13;
they would be willing to pay a monthly fee of 50 cents, or one-twxo percent of their monthly income ($30).&#13;
for the usage of the new system.&#13;
19.    A households' willingness to pay for an improved water supply system is directly related to its&#13;
income. The wealthiest quartile of households included in the sample is willing to pay the highest&#13;
absolute one-time installation fee ($20), but in terms of percentage of annual income, the poorest segment&#13;
of households is willing to pay the most, close to 10 percent of total annual income, compared to 3&#13;
percent of total income in the highest income group. Given the widespread poverty among the population&#13;
in the project area, people's willingness to pay for the water supply system of their choice, which in most&#13;
cases is an indoor pipe connection, is remarkably high.  [his indicates again the high level of&#13;
dissatisfaction with current water sources, as well as very high expectations regarding the improvement&#13;
of water supply and quality by means of a pipe connection.&#13;
HTygiene, Sanitation and Health&#13;
20.    In both urban and rural communities, the most common place for household members to wash&#13;
themselves, is a makeshift shower facility in the yard. One fifth of households were found to have indoor&#13;
washing facilities, while 15 percent of families rely on public bath houses for personal hygiene. While&#13;
most households have access to washing facilities, the frequency of taking a shower or bathing is&#13;
alarmingly low for both adults and children, especially in rural areas. Bath houses are only visited one-&#13;
four times per month, even though an alternative washing facility may not be available. In over 15&#13;
percent of families, children are washed less frequently than once a week in winter. In 15 percent of&#13;
urban and 30 percent of rural households, no soap was found near the washing facility.&#13;
21.    Most households (93 percent) use unventilated, unlined outside latrines; close to 5 percent of&#13;
households, all of them living in etrap centers, use public latrines. Only around 2 percent of respondents&#13;
claim to have a latrine inside their home. Yard (outside) latrines are permanent constructions in only 25&#13;
percent of households that use this kind of excreta disposal system. In all other cases, latrines need to be&#13;
moved when the pit is full, in most cases once a year. In many cases the level of ground water&#13;
determines the capacity of a latrine pit and thereby the frequency with which the location of a latrine must&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 52                                         Turkmenistan: Water Supplv and Sanitation Project&#13;
be changed. In most cases, latrines are cleaned only once a week or less frequently. These observations&#13;
stand in stark contrast with the fact that adequate sanitation is considered a major problem by less than&#13;
one percent of respondents.&#13;
22.    Based on both observed facts and people's own perception, the state of health of Dashkhovuz&#13;
residents must give reason for concern. Close to 40 percent of households describe the general state of&#13;
health of their members as "not very healthy", or "in poor health". In 34 percent of all households with&#13;
children six years old or younger, a child had been ill during the week preceding the survey. The flu was&#13;
reported to be the most common illness among children. Cases of diarrhea and intestinal parasites were&#13;
reported more frequently in rural than in urban areas.&#13;
23.    While no statistically significant correlation between child diseases and hygiene and sanitation&#13;
related behavior in families (frequency of washing children, frequency of cleaning latrine, etc.) was found&#13;
for the survey sample, the type of water source for drinking water used by individual families seems to&#13;
have an influence on the occurrence of certain diseases among children. Diseases related to intestinal&#13;
parasites, for example, are more common in households that use water from hand pumps, while the&#13;
occurrence of hepatitis A among children is higher in families that use water from surface water sources.&#13;
Subsequent studies during the preparation of the proposed project will be necessary to further explore and&#13;
explain these correlations.&#13;
Policy Implications&#13;
24.    Although etrap centers and rural communities centered around collective farms show very similar&#13;
characteristics with regard to infrastructure, architecture and lifestyle, they differ significantly with regard&#13;
to water supply and water use. Rural households are especially disadvantaged with respect to piped water&#13;
access and availability. It is therefore recommended that the first stage of the planned project focus on&#13;
the rehabilitation and expansion of existing piped systems in rural areas.&#13;
25.    An improvement of piped water systems already in place must be accompanied by the&#13;
revitalization or construction of chlorination facilities. As established in the report, only a third of existing&#13;
rural pipe networks are equipped with a chlorination facility, and in both urban and rural areas, only 31&#13;
percent of chlorination devices actually function. Adequate water chlorination would not only reduce the&#13;
risk of the population's exposure to water borne diseases, but also help save energy necessary to boil&#13;
water, a commonly used disinfection method in households and public institutions.&#13;
26.    Most households do not know which agency is responsible for the installation, operation and&#13;
maintenance of piped water systems in their community. Also, people generally have no idea about the&#13;
costs attached to these activities. Proper repair and maintenance services of public utilities are, however,&#13;
closely linked to the customers' (end users') possibility to report damage and address complaints to a&#13;
clearly visible, transparent institution.  It is, therefore, important to accompany actual technical&#13;
improvements of piped systems in individual communities with the provision of better customer service&#13;
and outreach by the responsible local water agency.&#13;
27.    As established above, people's willingness to pay for the water supply system of their choice, as&#13;
expressed in percentage of annual income, is surprisingly high. However, given the irregularity of salary&#13;
payments, and a family's high reliance on uncertain secondary income sources, it is doubtful that such fees&#13;
could actually be collected. The project should therefore build on in-kind contributions based on labor&#13;
for installation and maintenance of system components, rather than cash payments. However, a reasonable&#13;
annual fee should be collected to promote among the population the concept of resource pricing and to&#13;
enhance water conservation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supplv and Sanitation Proiect                                        Page 53&#13;
28.    The hygiene behavior of the population in the project area, as described by the existence of&#13;
washing facilities, the frequency of washing children, the presence of a hand washing facility near latrines&#13;
and other indicators, must give reason for concern in the whole region. Consequently, a campaign on the&#13;
importance of personal hygiene and sound sanitary facilities should be launched. Such an outreach effort&#13;
should focus strongly on institutions, where many people share cafeterias and sanitation facilities, and the&#13;
risk of transmission of diseases through unsafe hygienic behavior is especially high.&#13;
29.    The most common excreta disposal system  used by over 65 percent of households in the&#13;
communities included in the survey is an unventilated pit latrine in the yard. Only a fourth of these&#13;
latrines were found to be permanent constructions that can be emptied and used for an unlimited period&#13;
of time. However, the construction or installation of better sanitation facilities ranks very low on&#13;
households' list of problems and needs therefore any technical efforts to improve sanitation facilities in&#13;
the project area must be accompanied by a public awareness campaign on sanitation, hygiene, and health&#13;
in order to create a demand for improved services. Alternative, low cost latrine designs should be&#13;
considered.&#13;
30.    Project preparation includes a demonstration sanitation activity in schools. Most of the visited&#13;
institutions could benefit from such a demonstration. From the greatest need-based perspective, the pilot&#13;
project should be implemented in one of the schools in rural Boldumsaz, where the worst sanitary&#13;
conditions were encountered.&#13;
3 1.    An attempt was made throughout the needs assessment to find links between water consumption,&#13;
sanitation behavior and health. The findings presented in this report, such as the higher occurrence of&#13;
specific diseases among users of certain drinking water sources, and the more pessimistic self evaluation&#13;
regarding health by residents of specific etraps, should be further discussed during focus group meetings,&#13;
and, if possible, scientifically tested. Also, further research will be necessary to collect more information&#13;
on water treatment and water storage in order to gain a better picture of the risk of water contamination&#13;
incurred by households in the project area.&#13;

ANNEX C: INSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT6&#13;
A. Existing Organizational Framework&#13;
1.     Central Government Institutions With Sector Responsibilities&#13;
a.     Introduction This section presents a broad overview  of the principal institutions within the&#13;
Government of Turkmenistan with responsibilities for water, sanitation and health. These organizations&#13;
are briefly described below, with their areas of interest in the sector noted.&#13;
b.      Comments on Names of Organizations   The English versions of the names of government&#13;
organizations often seem strained when literally translated from Russian. Simplified translations have&#13;
been used in these notes to indicate the essence of the duties of the organizations, with titles more&#13;
commonly understood in English. Approximations of the literal Russian translation of the various&#13;
organizations described below appear in parentheses following the simplified name.&#13;
c.      Ministry of Water Resources (MWR)  This ministry has control over the allocation of the&#13;
country's water sources. Any "enterprise" (agricultural farms, industries, communities or others) wishing&#13;
to extract water (from surface or ground sources), or to discharge used or wastewater, must obtain written&#13;
authorization from this ministry to do so. Other entities also are involved in the application and review&#13;
process, but ultimate approval lies with the ministry. MWR also has a construction division, which is&#13;
responsible for constructing the major works for augmenting water supply to Dashkhovuz.&#13;
d.      Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) This ministry is the principal user of the country's water&#13;
resources in the form of irrigation. As such, it has a major impact on potable water supply because much&#13;
of the municipal water supply in Dashkhovuz is taken from shallow wells which are hydraulically linked&#13;
to the irrigation canals.  As a consequence, while the amounts removed for potable water are&#13;
inconsequential relative to irrigation usage, the quality of the irrigation water directly impacts that of the&#13;
potable water.&#13;
e.      Ministry of Environment (MOE) (Ministry of Nature and Ecology) This ministry has broad&#13;
statutory powers to approve applications for use of waters and disposal of wastewaters, but ultimately the&#13;
MWR appears to have the final say in such matters. The MOE was only established in 1989, and had&#13;
very little authority until 1992. Like similar ministries in other countries of the FSU, their legal powers&#13;
appear to be greater than their actual powers. They also have broad responsibilities over a wide range&#13;
of environmental issues, including use of pesticides, fertilizers and defoliants. They set standards for air&#13;
quality and wastewater treatment, and are currently following the GOST standards established by the&#13;
Soviet Union. They maintain a Department of Control and Inspection, with branches in all five regions&#13;
and the Caspian Sea, which is responsible for enforcing standards and compliance with agreements&#13;
reached for extraction of water, the quantity and quality of wastewater discharges, and air quality.&#13;
Unfortunately, this ministry does not have enforcement capabilities to match its legal powers.&#13;
f.      Ministry of Health (Sanitary and Epidemiological Services) (MOH/SES). SES is the division of&#13;
the MOH of most importance to the water, sanitation and health sectors. SES maintains a total of 67&#13;
"stations". There is a station in the capital city district of Ashgabat, each of the five velayets, all of the&#13;
6The information on which this is assessment was based comes from the project identification mission and background notes, Feebruary,&#13;
1995. Since Turkmenistan has been moving forward with reforms and reorganizations in several sectors, some of the information under&#13;
"Existing Organizational Framework" may have changed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Proiect                                    Page 55&#13;
etraps, and additional stations for inspecting ships and planes. In Dashkhovuz, for example, there are&#13;
stations in the city and Velayet of Dashkhovuz and in each of the etraps, for a total of 10 stations. SES&#13;
maintains 9 laboratories in Dashkhovuz. One serves both the city and velayet, and there are laboratories&#13;
in each of the etraps. The principal responsibilities of MOH/SES include: (1) monitor (collect samples&#13;
periodically and analyze the samples in their labs) the quality of potable water in public water systems&#13;
to ensure compliance with current standards (they use GOST standards), (2) collect and record&#13;
information on illnesses and diseases, and (3) investigate factors that could be harmful to the water, air,&#13;
ground and food environments.&#13;
g.     Turkmen Geology Committee   (TGC) The structure of the Geology function is that of a&#13;
Committee, headed by a General Director, and is not a ministry. It may be a "State" Committee, in that&#13;
it reports directly to the Cabinet of Ministers rather than through another ministry. A state committee&#13;
has most of the autonomy of a ministry, but ranks just below a ministry in importance. There are two&#13;
major divisions in the TGC. The Water Division is headed by a Chief Hydrogeologist, and the Mineral&#13;
Division is headed by a Chief Geologist. The Water Division has offices in all five velayets. These&#13;
branch offices can be either "Expeditions", which perform projects using only budgeted government&#13;
funds, or "Concerns", which work either with budgeted funds or under contract to other parties. At the&#13;
national level, the principal responsibility of the Water Division is to conduct research and carry out&#13;
investigations and planning to locate fresh water sources. Dashkhovuz has a "Concern", the South Aral&#13;
Hydrogeology Company (SAHC). Responsibilities at the velayet level are to conduct studies, drill wells,&#13;
monitor groundwater levels, advise "enterprises" of the availability of groundwater resources and approve&#13;
licenses for the extraction of groundwaters (which the enterprises need to obtain further permits from the&#13;
MOE and MWR to use those waters), and give advice to enterprises about the proper operation of wells&#13;
drilled by the TGC.&#13;
h.    Institute of Design  (IOD) (State Scientific Research, Design and Investigation Institute) IOD is&#13;
subordinate to the Ministry of Water Resources. Although there are other small design institutes&#13;
conducting minor projects, IOD is the only institute with the capability of undertaking planning and&#13;
design for major projects. Among its other duties, the IOD serves as a the technical planning entity for&#13;
studies and designs of water and wastewater projects. IOD is also said to supervise the construction of&#13;
works that they designed. If so, this is unusual in FSU practice, where construction supervision is rarely&#13;
practiced. They receive assignments from various governmental organizations at the national and&#13;
regional (velayet) levels. IOD became involved in the Dashkhovuz water supply schemes (source&#13;
augmentation) at the invitation of GOSTROI, the former soviet construction institute. IOD is also&#13;
responsible for the plan to ensure that all potable water is supplied by groundwater rather than from&#13;
surface supplies. This plan was developed in support of the recent Presidential Decree that established&#13;
this as official policy.&#13;
i.    Institute of Chemistry  (IOC) (Institute of Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences) Among its&#13;
other duties, the IOC maintains the only laboratory in Turkmenistan that has the capability of performing&#13;
water quality testing at the level of internationally acceptable standards. The IOC acts as an advisor to&#13;
various government organizations in matters of water quality.&#13;
j.     Housing and Communal Services (HCS) Up to about 1991, the HCS was a ministry. The duties&#13;
and responsibilities of HCS are now delegated to the velayet level, but a small group of advisors at the&#13;
Cabinet of Ministers serves to coordinate the HCS activities at the regional level. This national group&#13;
appears to have no executive powers or responsibilities. HCS is discussed in more detail in the following&#13;
sections on organizations at the regional level, where it appears to operate as a "trust". As part of the&#13;
old ministry establishment, there was a national Communal Design Institute (Communproyect). This&#13;
institute was responsible for the design of many of the water and wastewater systems in the country. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 56                                       Turkmenistan: Water Supplv and Sanitation Project&#13;
institute still exists, and now serves as a quasi-private consulting firm, specializing in water and&#13;
wastewater projects.&#13;
k.     Desert Research Institute  (DRI) Some 80% of the country is desert. The DRI is said to be one&#13;
of some ten similar institutes in the world, and is linked to the UN agency ESCAP. DRI has been&#13;
involved in a project for producing small, portable water filters. They have also proposed a study of the&#13;
environmental impact of irrigation and drainage as it effects desert lands, but this has not been approved&#13;
by the Government. DRI publishes bi-monthly scientific journals, which are available in English. The&#13;
next issue will discuss water and sanitation conditions in Turkmenistan, and is based on the conference&#13;
on this subject held in Ashgabat in September 1994. Officials report that nomads obtain water for&#13;
themselves and their livestock from dug wells as deep as 30 meters.&#13;
2.    Dashkhovuz Velayet Organizations with Sector Responsibilities&#13;
a.     Hakimlik of Dashkhovuz Velavet The five velayets or regions of Turkmenistan have considerable&#13;
authority, and the powers in the Velayet are vested in the Hakimlik. The term Hakimlik is roughly&#13;
translated as "the office of the leader". The leader of the Hakimlik is the Hakim, or governor. Each&#13;
etrap, or sub-region, is also headed by a Hakim. The etrap Hakims are responsible to the Velayet Hakim.&#13;
Etrap cities and collective farm are headed by an Archin. There are typically about four Vice-Hakims&#13;
which report to the Hakim. Allocation of duties varies, but broad categories include (1) transport,&#13;
construction, communications, housing and communal services, and rural water supply, (2) agriculture,&#13;
(3) commerce, business, legislation and administration, and (4) health, sanitation, culture and women's&#13;
issues. Petroleum may supplant agriculture in some velayets. Housing and communal services includes&#13;
public housing, central heating, water supply and piped wastewater collection and disposal (rare), but not&#13;
latrines, except for pumping out public latrines. Sanitation includes food handling in markets and&#13;
restaurants, and water quality.&#13;
b.     City of Dashkhovuz  In a manner somewhat comparable to Ashgabat, the City of Dashkhovuz&#13;
has its own organizations, including a separate department of Housing and Communal Services. This&#13;
department is responsible for water supply and piped wastewater collection and disposal in the city. This&#13;
responsibility is vested in the Dashkhovuz Vodocanal (water and sewer utility).&#13;
c.     City of Kuneurgench  Dashkhovuz and Kuneurgench are the only officially designated "cities"&#13;
of the Velayet. The urban capitals of the other etraps are called "city-type settlements" (or etrap centers).&#13;
Like Dashkhovuz, Kuneurgench has responsibility for its own water supply, and has its own Vodocanal.&#13;
d.     Regional Offices of National Organizations   Most ministries have local representatives at the&#13;
velayet level. There appears to be a dual relationship to the parent ministry and the Hakimlik of the&#13;
Velayet. HCS, no longer a ministry, operates as a "trust" at the Velayet Hakimlik, but, at the etrap&#13;
level, HCS appears to be subordinated to the Vice-Hakims of the etrap Hakimliks. The significance of&#13;
operating as a trust is not clear. There does not appear to be a regional branch of the Institutes for&#13;
Design and Chemistry. The Expeditions or Concerns of the TGC appear to be independent of the&#13;
Hakimlik.&#13;
e.     Rural Water Supplv Department (RWSD) The responsibilities for the provision of potable water&#13;
in Dashkhovuz Velayet are widely scattered. As noted, Dashkhovuz and Kuneurgench have their own&#13;
Vodocanals, which report to HCS at the velayet level. Water supply in the etrap centers is the&#13;
responsibility of a Vice Hakim who has links to the housing and communal services department at the&#13;
Velayet level, but is directly responsible to the etrap Hakim. However, some 69% of the velayet&#13;
population lives in rural areas. Primary responsibility for serving these people with potable water is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supplv and Sanitation Proiect                                      Page 57&#13;
assigned to the Rural Water Supply Department of the Hakimlik of Dashkhovuz. This arrangement&#13;
appears to be peculiar to Dashkhovuz. In other velayets, the MWR has this responsibility. Even in&#13;
Dashkhovuz, MWR arranges for the construction of the works, which are then turned over to RWSD for&#13;
operation. The great majority of the rural population live on collective farms. RWSD currently&#13;
maintains water systems in less than half the 104 collective farms in the velayet. Based on experiences&#13;
in other countries of the FSU, the Ministry of Agriculture was probably responsible for providing&#13;
drinking water to the farms, but this appears to be no longer the case. RWSD operates some 48 rural&#13;
water systems. Most other collectives have either no system or inoperative systems. In those cases, the&#13;
Archins or managers of the collective farms are said to have responsibility for water supply. In practice,&#13;
most people meet their own water needs, largely through dug or drilled wells with handpumps.&#13;
5.     Etrap Sector Responsibilities&#13;
Hakimliks of the Etraps As noted, there are eight developed etraps in Dashkhovuz Velayet. Of these,&#13;
one (Turkmenbashi) has no settlement capital, and Dashkhovuz etrap has a settlement that is not a capital&#13;
(Niyazovsck). The etraps have structures similar to those of Dashkhovuz Velayet, with a Hakim and&#13;
several (usually four) Vice-Hakims. The MOH/SES and HCS organizations have local staffs in the&#13;
etraps, under Vice-Hakims, for water, sanitation and health. These responsibilities appear to be limited&#13;
to the settlement cities for water supply, but the health services may be extended to the rural areas within&#13;
the etraps. HCS offices appear to have responsibility for pumping out public latrines in the cities and&#13;
settlements, but not in rural areas. No organization appears to have responsibility for the design,&#13;
construction, and promulgation of latrines, nor in the education of people as to their use and the&#13;
importance of such use to their health.&#13;
B. Institutional Assessment&#13;
1.     Organizational Weaknesses&#13;
a.     Lack of Focus on Sector Responsibilities Housing and Comnmunal Services (HCS), before it was&#13;
disbanded as a ministry, was responsible for the provision of water supply to the people of Turkmenistan.&#13;
Since disbandment, that responsibility has not been represented at the ministerial level. The Ministry of&#13;
Water Resources has the important responsibility of serving as the adjudicator of how the country's scarce&#13;
water resources are to be allocated and it is presently the ministry most closely associated with the&#13;
provision of public water supply. However, MWR has no department with responsibility for the public&#13;
water supply sector. At the velayet level, HCS is responsible for public water supply and for wastewater&#13;
collection and disposal. However, HCS has many other responsibilities, and water and wastewater is just&#13;
one of many communal services in its portfolio.&#13;
b.     Gaps in Responsibilities The most obvious gap in sector responsibilities is that for the provision&#13;
of safe and convenient means of excreta disposal. Current analyses of health studies indicate that&#13;
hygienic disposal of human excreta is one of the most critical requirements to assure the health of the&#13;
people. The Housing and Communal Services department is responsible for the provision of piped&#13;
sewerage systems for the disposal of wastewater, but there is only one such system in the entire velayet,&#13;
in Dashkhovuz City. As no other urban settlement has any significant levels of interior plumbing, there&#13;
is currently no need for other piped sewer systems. HCS also has the responsibility for pumping out&#13;
public latrines, but this is a very limited effort. There are no safe and economic means presently&#13;
available for the sanitary removal and disposal of household excreta wastes. The great majority of the&#13;
people in Dashkhovuz utilize very simple but unhygienic pit latrines, and no organization appears to have&#13;
responsibility for the design, construction or promulgation of adequate latrines, or programs for the&#13;
education of the people in the importance and hygienic use of latrines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 58                                        Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
c.     Overlapping Responsibilities  Some 69% of the population of Dashkhovuz live in rural areas,&#13;
yet less than half of these people are served by the Rural Water Supply department. In other velayets,&#13;
MWR has reponsibility for rural water supply. Even in Dashkhovuz, MWR has the responsibility for&#13;
the construction of rural water systems, while RWS only has operational responsibilities.  The water&#13;
systems that RWS operates are very similar to those in the urban settlements, yet RWS and HCS, which&#13;
operates the urban systems, function independently.&#13;
e.     National Sector Policy Problems One of the problems with national policy is its failure to assign&#13;
clear responsibility for the water, wastewater and sanitation sector. Another problem is the existing law&#13;
preventing sector utilities from collecting fees for the services they perform. The lack of long term&#13;
planning for the sector is one of the consequences of failure to assign overall sector responsibility to a&#13;
specific government agency. The inadequacies of the existing systems and the large numbers of people&#13;
without adequate water or sanitation services have several causes, but inadequate funding is one of the&#13;
principal ones. National pricing policies and lack of focussed responsibility are among the principal&#13;
causes of the lack of funding.&#13;
2.     Operational Weaknesses&#13;
a.     Planning and Management There is little evidence of long term planning to overcome existing&#13;
deficiencies. Even the current crisis of providing water only a few hours per day appears to be accepted&#13;
with resignation, though there is evidence that water is being wasted under present procedures in volumes&#13;
which considerably exceed the amounts required to meet the needs of the people 24 hours per day. In&#13;
many tables of organization, far too many departments report to the head of the organization. There was&#13;
little evidence of any systems for the accurate collection of financial and technical operating data, and for&#13;
the distribution of this information to managers. Except for antiquated personal computers (286 units,&#13;
with 1 MB of RAM  and 40 MB hard disk was typical) at the Geology Committee and Institute of&#13;
Chemistry, no computers were observed at the offices visited. Realistic budgeting and cost estimating&#13;
are not practiced at the water supply utility level.&#13;
b.     Operation and Maintenance  The current financial difficulties contribute to severe operational&#13;
problems. Critical parts and supplies are rarely available. Equipment is often cannibalized, and any but&#13;
the simplest of repairs usually must be made in Dashkhovuz City or, more commonly, back in Ashgabat.&#13;
Procurement procedures are centralized and complicated, and operators have little control over obtaining&#13;
the equipment and supplies they require. There was little evidence of preventive maintenance, or the&#13;
tools with which to accomplish it. On the other hand, there is often no budget for grease, pump packing&#13;
I tools or other materials and supplies. Operators rarely have copies of the plans and specifications for&#13;
the works under their responsibility, and no operating manuals or guidelines were noted.&#13;
Almost all the piped water systems in Dashkhovuz Velayet utilize water from shallow wells adjacent to&#13;
irrigation canals.  It appears that some of the problems with degraded water quality from these wells&#13;
results from operation of the wells in a manner that does not comply with recommendations from the&#13;
authorities of the TGC's hydrogeological companies. Given the importance of these wells, consideration&#13;
should be given to providing TGC a stronger role in ensuring the proper operation of these wells.&#13;
c.     Human Resources   Salaries of employees in the water, sanitation and health sectors in&#13;
Dashkhovuz Velayet are extremely low, particularly in relation to the Capital. For instance, employees&#13;
of the carpet factory in Ashgabat earn twice the pay of a senior engineer in most departments in&#13;
Dashkhovuz, where typical salaries at the senior levels are in the order of less than US$ 20 per month.&#13;
Working conditions are poor, with inadequate vehicles for transport, poor communications and sparsely&#13;
equipped and furnished offices. Training programs are few and generally inappropriate. Training (most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

of it dating back to pre-independence) often seemed to focus on design and advanced technologies rather&#13;
than meeting actual needs.&#13;
3.     Summary of the Existing Institutional Situation of the Sector&#13;
The principal weaknesses of the sector include (1) allocation of responsibility for the sector among too&#13;
many governmental agencies, (2) the wide range of responsibilities other than water and sanitation&#13;
assigned to HCS, the principal agency charged with providing water supply, (3) lack of technical and&#13;
management skills throughout the sector, (4) the absence of a coherent program for the effective operation&#13;
and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities, (5) inadequate focus on the importance of providing&#13;
effective means of excreta disposal, (6) inadequacy of funding for both capital construction of new and&#13;
replacement facilities, and for operation and maintenance of existing facilities, and (7) a national policy&#13;
which provides water and sanitation services at no cost to the users.&#13;
C. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
1.     Proposed Approach to Sector Reform&#13;
There are three components of the proposed approach for building capacity for the effective provision&#13;
of water and sanitation services in Dashkhovuz: (1) reform of the sector at the national level, (2)&#13;
reorganization of the sector at the velayet level, and (3) internal strengthening of the velayet sector&#13;
organizations.&#13;
2.     Sector Reform Needs at the National Level&#13;
a.     Assignment and Clarification of Responsibilities The various laws and regulations of the country&#13;
should be reviewed and revised to clarify responsibilities for the water, wastewater and sanitation sector.&#13;
The following general principles are suggested for adoption:&#13;
(1)    Primary Responsibility to the Velayets  Assign primary responsibility for providing&#13;
water, wastewater and sanitation services (the sector) for the people of Turkmenistan to&#13;
the five velayets, or regions&#13;
(2)    Regulatory and Support Role for the National Government Retain the responsibility and&#13;
improve the capacity for regulation, policy setting and broad sectoral planning; and&#13;
provide sector support such as training of facility operation and maintenance staff&#13;
(3)    Inter-Ministerial Coordination Clarify the relationships and responsibilities among all&#13;
ministries to ensure that (a) the regulatory functions of MOH, MOE, MOF and MWR&#13;
(for water quality and health; wastewater and septage disposal and environmental&#13;
concerns; budgeting, finance and personnel policies; and priority allocation of water&#13;
resources) are appropriate and clear, and (b) that the planning, design, construction,&#13;
operation and maintenance of sector facilities are reserved to the velayet sector&#13;
organizations, and not by any other ministry.&#13;
b.     Required Actions at the National Level In order to achieve these reforms, the actions to be taken&#13;
include:&#13;
(1)    Obtain national approval of the proposed program for institutional development of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 60                                        Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
water, wastewater and sanitation sector (the sector)&#13;
(2)    Appoint the Ministry of Water Resources, or such other national ministerial level body&#13;
as the government may decide, to assume sector responsibilities for broad national&#13;
planning, adoption of national policies and the provision of support as appropriate&#13;
(3)    Draft legislation which will (a) set forth and assign the national sector responsibilities&#13;
described above, (b) assigns responsibility for the planning, design, construction,&#13;
operation and maintenance of the sector to new "Regional Water and Sanitation&#13;
Authorities" at the velayet level, and (c) grants autonomy to the velayets in such&#13;
important matters as control over personnel, setting tariff levels, controlling finances, and&#13;
planning and execution of projects. (Note: Until such time as the velayet water and&#13;
sanitation organizations are financially self-supporting, the central government should&#13;
provide adequate funds for the construction and replacement of needed facilities, and for&#13;
the operation and maintenance of existing facilities)&#13;
3.     Reorganization of the Sector in Dashkhovuz Velayet&#13;
a.     Identification of Existing Sector Responsibilities and Needs in Dashkhovuz The first step toward&#13;
reorganization would be to identify existing responsibilities and needs. It appears that responsibility for&#13;
water supply and wastewater collection in urban centers, and for institutional sanitation in both urban and&#13;
rural areas is vested in the department of Housing and Communal Services (HCS). Responsibility for&#13;
water supply in rural areas is vested in the Rural Water Supply department of the velayet, but many rural&#13;
areas have little or no public water service. No organization has responsibility for excreta disposal or&#13;
sanitation services for homes or other private interests. While this may represent a general outline of the&#13;
sector in Dashkhovuz, full understanding will be required before the sector can be reorganized.&#13;
b.     Suggested Regional Sector Reorganization The proposed name of the new organization is the&#13;
"Dashkhovuz Regional Water Supply and Sanitation Authority" (Dashkhovuz Velayet Vodocanal). The&#13;
Authority could report to a new "Division of Water Supply and Sanitation" within the Ministry of Water&#13;
Resources, or some other arrangement as may be determined. The Authority would be governed by a&#13;
seven person Board of Directors and headed by a Managing Director.&#13;
The Authority would have three basic operating divisions: the Dashkhovuz Vodocanal (for facilities in&#13;
the velayet capital), the Etrap Centers Vodocanal (for facilities in all the etrap centers and the city of&#13;
Niayozovsk), and the Kolkhos or Rural Vodocanal (for facilities in the remaining areas of the Velayet).&#13;
The Authority would also contain five support divisions: Finance and Administration, Personnel,&#13;
Engineering, Quality Control and Customer Services. In addition, three functions would report directly&#13;
to the office of the Managing Director: Internal Audit, Legal and Public Relations. A provisional&#13;
organization chart for the new regional authority is presented as Annex 1. The basic duties of each of&#13;
the support divisions is listed on the chart.&#13;
4.      Strengthening the New Regional Organization&#13;
a.     Source of Personnel and Equipment for the New Organization The new organization would draw&#13;
heavily on the various sector organizations that already are functioning in the velayet. The operating&#13;
personnel for Dashkhovuz city now exist in the water and wastewater divisions of the Dashkhovuz&#13;
Vodocanal. The etrap Vice Hakims and their staffs, and the staff of the Rural Water Supply department&#13;
would become the core personnel for the operating divisions of the Etrap and Rural divisions,&#13;
respectively. All three groups would contribute personnel to be assigned to the support divisions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Proiect                                  Page 61&#13;
according to their skills. However, the component organizations that would become a part of the new&#13;
regional organization have inadequate skills and limited resources compared to what would be required&#13;
to develop an effective water and sanitation utility.  Some of these skills include operation and&#13;
maintenance of facilities, management, collection and dissemination of critical information, finance,&#13;
administration and personnel. To build capacity in these areas would require training and the provision&#13;
of equipment and supplies.&#13;

ANNEX E: COST RECOVERY CONSIDERATIONS FOR&#13;
DASHKHOVUZ VELAYET&#13;
A.    World Bank Experience and Policy on Cost Recovery for Water Projects&#13;
The World Bank has over twenty years' experience with water supply and sanitation projects worldwide,&#13;
and has closely examined the results of these investments. In the past, many projects have experienced&#13;
implementation and operational problems. Analysis of the Bank's water and sanitation portfolio has&#13;
shown that, underlying these problems, is a vicious cycle of poor water quality and unreliable service&#13;
delivery that results in consumer's reduced willingness-to-pay, which, in turn, generates inadequate&#13;
operating funds and a further deterioration in services. Experience has proven that water must be&#13;
recognized as an economic good, and that most of the financing must come from users in order for&#13;
investments in water supply projects to be sustainable. These results from the World Bank investment&#13;
projects in water supply and sanitation have led to the adoption of the Bank's policy that water pricing&#13;
and cost recovery are essential to project sustainability and must be included in all projects. The World&#13;
Bank policy states that cost recovery should be sufficient to pay both for operation and maintenance, as&#13;
well as a fair return on capital investment. User fees not only address the financial sustainability of water&#13;
supply systems but they also serve to conserve scarce water and thus contribute to the environmental&#13;
sustainability of World Bank funded projects.&#13;
B.    Financial Analysis of the Current Project&#13;
1.    Tariff Rates Required to Recover all Proiect Costs  The Turkmenistan Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation project preparation has included an economic and financial analysis which is summarized in&#13;
the Bank's Staff Appraisal Report. The analysis calculated the average tariff necessary to fully cover the&#13;
total financial costs of the project, including (1) the cost to operate and maintain the new and rehabilitated&#13;
water system (O&amp;M costs), and (2) the cost to repay the loan required to finance the project. The tariffs&#13;
required to finance the water systems in the etrap cities is about $0. 53 per cubic meter, and the tariff&#13;
rate required to recover all the costs for the collective farm systems is about $0.63 per cubic meter.&#13;
These values may change somewhat as final adjustments are made to the project.&#13;
2.     Tariff Rates Required to Recover O&amp;M Costs While the Bank policy proposes full cost recovery,&#13;
this may be unrealistic at this time under the conditions which exist in Turkinenistan. As a consequence,&#13;
the financial analysis also considered the tariff rates required to recover only the O&amp;M component of the&#13;
total project costs. The analysis determined that a tariff rate of about $0.15 per cubic meter would be&#13;
sufficient to recover this component of project costs for water supply system improvements in both the&#13;
etrap cities and the collective farms.&#13;
3.     Rule-of-Thumb for Determining Affordability Experience in developing countries has indicated&#13;
that people can afford and generally are willing to pay from 4 to 6% of their monthly income for a&#13;
dependable supply of safe drinking water. Household income data for Dashkhovuz are difficult to&#13;
determine with accuracy, but average monthly income for households with yard connections (which tend&#13;
to be more affluent than households served by street faucets) are in the order of $25 per month.&#13;
Applying the above "affordability" test, households with yard connections should be able to afford from&#13;
$1.00 to $1.50 per month to pay for a dependable supply of water. At current (mid-January 1997) rates&#13;
of exchange, this amounts to about 5,500 to 8,000 manats per month. As described in paragraph 5 of&#13;
Section D, the estimated cost to households with yard connections would be about 7,000 manats, or 5.4%&#13;
of household income. Such a charge appears to be affordable.&#13;

C.    Common Methods of Charging for Water Provided to Customers&#13;
1.    Introduction Whether water utilities are owned by the government or a private company, almost&#13;
without exception, these utilities charge their customers for the water which is delivered to them. With&#13;
some variations, the water is charged to the user in one of the following four ways:&#13;
2.     Metering The most common means of determining the amount to be charged is to provide a&#13;
metering device on the pipe that delivers the water to the customer. This system requires that each&#13;
customer (household) has its own water connection. It also requires the cost of installing and reading the&#13;
meter, sending out the bills, and collecting the amounts due. It is the most expensive and complex&#13;
system, but it is also the fairest, since the user pays directly for the amount of water received. It has the&#13;
added advantage of encouraging users to conserve water and minimize waste.&#13;
3.     Flat Rate Charging This system is much simpler and much less expensive to administer. All&#13;
customers are billed a flat or equal charge each month, regardless of usage. The biggest disadvantage&#13;
is that the system is not fair, since large and small users pay the same. The system encourages waste and&#13;
discourages conservation.&#13;
4.     Component of Real Estate (Housing) Tax In communities where municipal taxes are charged&#13;
to owners of homes or apartment buildings, it is possible to add a surcharge to the real estate or housing&#13;
tax bill to allow for the cost of delivering water to these buildings. In this way, the home owner pays&#13;
for his water indirectly, and the apartment renter also pays indirectly for his water as a component of his&#13;
monthly rent. Some municipal or other governmental agencies object to acting as the "bill collector" for&#13;
the water utility. In addition, this system does not discourage water waste habits as the charge for water&#13;
is hidden in the tax bill.&#13;
5.     Charges Based on Household Size or Plumbing Fixtures Some water utilities base the charge for&#13;
water use on the number of square meters in the house or apartment (this was common in the former&#13;
Soviet Union) or the number and type of water-using plumbing fixtures in the house or apartment. These&#13;
systems are difficult to administer because of problems in measurement of living space, or changes in the&#13;
number and type of plumbing units. This system also does little to discourage water waste habits as the&#13;
charge for water is not related to the amounts used.&#13;
6.     Conditions in Dashkhovuz Which Affect Water Pricing  The systems of charging for water&#13;
described above are based largely on systems under which water is delivered directly to each household.&#13;
In Dashkhovuz, most people receive their water through public street faucets (sometimes called&#13;
standpipes), and some by yard connections. Billing for water delivered by street faucets (or yard&#13;
connections) is more difficult, but has been done in other locations. Strategies for charging for water in&#13;
Dashkhovuz are discussed in the following section.&#13;
D.    Strategies for Charging for Water in Dashkhovuz&#13;
1.    Background There are several impediments to levying charges for water in Dashkhovuz. One&#13;
is the current national policy that water is considered to be a benefit to be provided to the people without&#13;
cost. Another is the relative poverty of the people in the area. Other impediments include the very poor&#13;
quality of the water service currently being provided, and the sense of being treated fairly. "Why should&#13;
I pay if others don't have to?" is a question that deserves a reasonable answer.&#13;
2.     Strategy No. 1 The first strategy is to make it clear to everyone that no one should be asked to&#13;
pay for water until there is a demonstrable improvement in the quality of the service being provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                    Page 65&#13;
Only those users who receive water from the new or rehabilitated water supply systems in their&#13;
communities will be asked to pay for the water they receive from the systems.&#13;
3.     Strategy No. 2 The next strategy is to start now to inform the people of the intentions of the new&#13;
water supply improvement scheme; which is to provide safe, disinfected, water under pressure to their&#13;
neighborhood street faucet or their yard connection for most hours during the day. At the same time,&#13;
the people will be advised that it will cost money to maintain this new, improved level of service, and&#13;
that this level cannot be maintained without the financial support of the users. The answer to their&#13;
question as to why they should have to pay when others don't, is that the others aren't getting this better&#13;
level of service. A public education program should be prepared and conducted to introduce these&#13;
concepts, the need for water conservation, and to demonstrate that water is a valuable commodity worth&#13;
paying for.&#13;
4.     Strategy No. 3 The third strategy is to provide differential levels of payment for those who have&#13;
to carry their water from street faucets and those who have it delivered to their yards by a direct piped&#13;
connection. As the service improves, it is expected that there will be an increased demand by more&#13;
people for yard connections. The Social Needs Assessment clearly demonstrated that yard connections&#13;
are greatly preferred over the use of public street faucets. Households will have to pay the cost of&#13;
making this connection to the system to pipe water to their yards. They will then have to make larger&#13;
monthly payments to the water utility once the connection is completed, further increasing the revenues&#13;
to the utility. People with yard connections should be expected to pay two to three times as much for&#13;
their service as those who have to carry their water, and the tariff structure should provide for this.&#13;
5.     Strategy No. 4 The initial stage of cost recovery would be based on charging fees for water used&#13;
by those with yard connections at a level which provides for the full recovery of the estimated operation&#13;
and maintenance (O&amp;M) cost component of the water used. In the absence of water meters, charges&#13;
would be based on their estimated water usage. The convenience of direct yard connections will increase&#13;
the amounts of water used, so it was assumed that water usage by those with connections would amount&#13;
to 50 liters per capita per day (Ipcd). Assuming six persons per household, a typical household would&#13;
use nine cubic meters per month. The estimated cost of the O&amp;M component of the total cost of water&#13;
is $0.15 per cubic meter. For nine cubic meters per month, this represents a cost of $1.35 per household&#13;
per month. At current exchange rates, this amounts to about 7,000 manats per household per month, or&#13;
about 5.4% of estimated monthly household income. The charge to those receiving water from street&#13;
faucets could be in the order of 2,000 to 3,000 manat per month per household, and could vary (below&#13;
or above this range) depending on the number of persons per household.&#13;
6.     Strategy No. 5 In order to collect information about actual water usage, it is recommended that&#13;
some of the yard connection customers be provided with water meters. A pilot program of installing&#13;
meters on about 20% of all yard connections is suggested. These customers would be billed on the same&#13;
estimated rate as other yard connection customers, not on the basis of the metered water use. At some&#13;
future date, the water utility may wish to install meters on all yard connections and bill for actual water&#13;
used, but this probably should not be done initially. Water metering is currently being studied in a pilot&#13;
program in Ashgabat under a UNDP-funded program, and the results of that study may be applied to&#13;
future programs in Dashkhovuz.&#13;
7..    Strategy No. 6  An early decision should be made on the method of charging for water in&#13;
Dashkhovuz, and a system for collecting the amounts charged. The system of charging and collection&#13;
should be in place and operational as soon as the improvements to the water system are available to the&#13;
people. Prior to implementation, this system should be fully explained by means of a public information&#13;
program.  Through gradual tariff increases in unit charges for water and increased use of yard&#13;
&#13;

connections in place of street faucets, the full costs of operation and maintenance to support the new&#13;
water systems should be recovered by the time the project is implemented.&#13;
E.    Summary and Future Considerations&#13;
This paper has described some of the various systems used to recover the costs of water supply systems,&#13;
and has suggested a specific set of strategies to consider to implement cost recovery in Dashkhovuz.&#13;
Even though the system described in this paper will not result in full cost recovery, it will generate a&#13;
substantial flow of funds to contribute to the costs of operating and maintaining the new water supply&#13;
systems. Equally important, it will begin the process of educating people to the economic value of this&#13;
valuable resource, and the importance of paying for this service. The project will support the Government&#13;
in identifying, selecting and implementing a system of cost recovery which is best suited for the&#13;
conditions in Turkmenistan.&#13;

ANNEX F: REVIEW OF THE TUYAMUYUN AND&#13;
LEBAT REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SCHEMES&#13;
1.    Introduction. Two regional water supply schemes have been proposed by technical organisations&#13;
within the Government of Turkmenistan as solutions for the water supply problems of the Velayet of&#13;
Dashkhovuz. These are the Tuyamuyun surface water scheme, and the Lebat groundwater source.&#13;
Extensive investigations have been carried out on both these schemes by local organisations, and&#13;
construction has conmmenced on the Tuyamuyun supply scheme. As part of the project preparation&#13;
activities, a review of the two schemes has been carried out, and this annex summarises this work.&#13;
The Tuyamuyun Scheme&#13;
2.    Background. Water supplies for the velayet have historically been obtained from the irrigation&#13;
canal system, which is fed chiefly from the Shavat Canal. As the quality of this water deteriorated&#13;
significantly during the 1970s and 1980s, as a result of excessive use of agro-chemicals in the irrigated&#13;
areas upstream, alternative sources were sought to try to guarantee water of reasonable quality for the&#13;
velayet. The only source with a large enough yield is the Tuyamuyun reservoir on the Amu Darya, some&#13;
190 km upstream of Dashkhovuz, and this was selected for development. At the time the Government&#13;
of Uzbekistan was planning its own schemes based on the reservoir as a source. The reservoir, although&#13;
geographically within Turkmenistan, is jointly owned by Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.&#13;
3.    The Tuyamuyun Reservoir. The reservoir has a retained volume of 2,340 million cubic metres,&#13;
and although largely used for hydropower and irrigation, is also used as a source of potable water for&#13;
two regions of Uzbekistan. The withdrawals for potable water (400,000 cubic metres per day for the&#13;
Uzbek schemes) are negligible in comparison to both the reservoir capacity and the water requirement&#13;
for irrigation. There are three other reservoirs, Kaparas, Sultan Sandjiran and Kozbulat, which are linked&#13;
to Tuyamuyun, and are at present used for irrigation storage, although there are plans to reserve the&#13;
Kaparas reservoir for use as a potable water source.&#13;
4.    The Kaparas Scheme. The Kaparas scheme was planned as a means of optimising the quality&#13;
of raw water available to the region for potable supplies. Water would be admitted to the reservoir&#13;
between April and July, when the snow melt from the headwaters of the Amu Darya results in&#13;
improvements in water quality. This water would then be abstracted for potable use when the water&#13;
quality in the Tuyamuyun reservoir deteriorated in the autumn and winter. Work was put in hand in 1990&#13;
by the Government of Uzbekistan to isolate the reservoir from the Tuyamuyun reservoir, and to construct&#13;
the intake arrangements and transfer pipelines needed for the Uzbek water supply schemes.&#13;
5.     Following the independence of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, the use of agro-chemicals fell&#13;
dramatically, and one consequence was that river water quality improved, to the extent that agro-chemical&#13;
residues and heavy metals are no longer an important water quality issue in the Amu Darya. The most&#13;
significant quality issue is now water salinity, and despite extensive studies in Uzbekistan there are still&#13;
conflicting opinions on whether or not the water from a Kaparas scheme will be of significantly better&#13;
quality than water from the existing Tuyamuyun reservoir. The need for the Kaparas scheme, and&#13;
justification for the cost needed to complete it, is still unproven. In the meantime construction of the&#13;
isolating structures, and intake arrangements for the Uzbek schemes, is proceeding slowly. The cost of&#13;
construction of the additional intake needed for Turkmenistan, together with the transfer pipelines, is&#13;
estimated as US$ 82 million: this assumes that the isolating structures are completed by the Uzbeks.&#13;
&#13;

6.    The present scheme. The intake for the present scheme for Turkmenistan is located on the&#13;
Pitnyak-Arna canal, immediately downstream of the Tuyamuyun barrage. This will pump the raw water&#13;
10 km to a treatment plant, from where the treated water will be pumped a further 175 km to a main&#13;
distribution center near Dashkhovuz. Five pumping mains, with a total length of 292 km, will carry the&#13;
water from this distribution center to the etrap centers, including Dashkhovuz. Storage reservoirs would&#13;
be provided at each of the etrap centers, along with rechlorination facilities. There are no plans to supply&#13;
the collective farms from this system.&#13;
7.    The scheme has been planned in two phases: Phase 1, which is partially completed, would supply&#13;
109 Mid by 1995 , whilst Phase 2 would increase the scheme capacity to 337 Mid and was planned to&#13;
be completed in 2010. Work on Phase 1 commenced in 1989, but following the independence of&#13;
Turkmenistan, funding for construction became increasingly scarce, and work is now at a virtual&#13;
standstill. During the project identification mission the scheme was reviewed and it was considered that&#13;
the it represented a sufficient level of investment by the Government of Turkmnenistan to warrant&#13;
examining in detail the feasibility and costs of completing the first stage of the scheme, and determining&#13;
whether this could form part of this project.&#13;
8.    The design and concept of the scheme is in general appropriate although the pipeline sizing is&#13;
such that high operating costs will be incurred at the design flows. This may be because power at the time&#13;
of design was cheap, and it was advantageous to reduce the capital costs by installing smaller pipe&#13;
diameters. The treatment process is sophisticated and it may be possible to simplify this without&#13;
compromising the effectiveness of the treatment.&#13;
9.    At the present time, the civil engineering works on the intake and water treatment plant are&#13;
around 50% complete. The workmanship is not to usual international standards, although it is customary&#13;
in the region that extensive remedial works are carried out to most structures prior to their being put into&#13;
service. No mechanical and electrical equipment has been purchased to date. About 8.5 km of the raw&#13;
water pipeline has been laid, and 167 km of the treated water pipeline to Dashkhovuz. A small length&#13;
(20 km out of 292 km) of the pipelines from the distribution center near Dashkhovuz have been laid,&#13;
though work has not started on any of the pumping stations and reservoirs needed within the velayet.&#13;
10.   Costs to completion. The cost of completing Phase 1 of the scheme has been estimated as US$&#13;
514.5 million, as shown in Table x. 1: to provide a supply to Dashkhovuz alone will require an investment&#13;
of US$ 215 million. One of the major elements essential for completion of any variant of the original&#13;
scheme is the laying of the final sections of the raw and treated water pipelines, and lining of the existing&#13;
mains to prevent corrosion. The total cost of this work is estimated as US$ 150 million.&#13;

11.   A revised scheme has been proposed in the consultant's feasibility report that would supply 75&#13;
Mld at a cost of US$ 322 million. The cost savings have been made by limiting the output, thus reducing&#13;
the size of the pumps and other scheme components that have not yet been built, and omitting some&#13;
treatment processes which are not considered to be needed following the improvement in quality of the&#13;
Tuyamuyun water. The scheme will then have the capacity to supply the etraps of Dashkhovuz,&#13;
Niyazovsk, Yilanly, Akdepe and Tagta, including the rural areas, although the cost estimate does not&#13;
include the cost of the pipelines to the rural centers.&#13;
12.    Conclusions. The Tuyamuyun scheme as presently conceived would supply only the etrap centres,&#13;
including Dashkhovuz. Completion of the scheme, even if it were within the financial limitations of the&#13;
proposed project, would not meet the objectives of the project in providing improvements to supplies in&#13;
both urban and rural areas across the velayet; indeed, it is probable that the majority of the water from&#13;
the new scheme would go to Dashkhovuz, at the expense of the etrap centres. The revised scheme&#13;
proposed by the consultants is an improvement in this regard, but the fact remains that whilst the local&#13;
sources remain viable in terms of water quality, the additional capital and operating costs (up to $&#13;
0.46/cu.m) of the scheme are not justified by the improvement in quality.&#13;
13.    There are doubts about the long term sustainability of the scheme, because of the reliance on&#13;
imported chemicals to treat the surface water, the durability, given the poor quality of construction&#13;
apparent in the works constructed to date, and the current lack of a suitable organisation to operate and&#13;
maintain the scheme. It is critical for such a large investment that an adequate operation and maintenance&#13;
organisation is set up well before the scheme is completed, and at the present time there is no clear&#13;
picture of where such an organisation will be developed from.&#13;
14.    The cost of completing the scheme, even at the reduced output proposed by the consultant, is far&#13;
in excess of the maximum loan amount envisaged for this project, or indeed any loan contemplated by&#13;
the Bank for the country in the near future.&#13;
15.    For the above reasons, it is concluded that it is not appropriate for the Bank to consider&#13;
supporting continued construction of the scheme at the present time. The viability of the scheme in the&#13;
longer term is dependent on the relative water quality in the irrigation canals in the velayet, and the&#13;
Tuyamuyun reservoir: if the canal water quality remains as at present, then there is no clear case for&#13;
expenditure on such a scale for a marginal improvement in water quality. However, the quality of both&#13;
waters needs to be closely monitored in the short term to detect any deterioration as early as possible.&#13;
The Lebat Groundwater Scheme&#13;
16.   This scheme would use the Balqui aquifer in the northern Kara-Kum desert, some 60 km south&#13;
of the Tuyamuyun canal and 220 km from Dashkhovuz. The aquifer is formed from alluvial sands,&#13;
possibly deposited by the Amu Darya in the period when it flowed to the Caspian Sea, and the water&#13;
resoures within the aquifer are essentially fossil water: some recharge from rainfall (annual average is&#13;
80 to 110 mm) and condensation does occur, but this is thought to be small compared to any likely&#13;
exploitation.&#13;
17.    Exploration of the aquifer has been carried out by the South Aral Hydrogelogical Expedition&#13;
(SAHE), who have determined that the aquifer is between 100 and 200 m thick, with the water table&#13;
between 19 and 38 m below ground level. The water in the aquifer varies in salinity, becoming more&#13;
saline with depth, and also as the alluvium becomes thinner at the edges of the aquifer. SAHE have&#13;
determined that the 1.5 g/l iso-salinity line (deemed to be the maximum salinty exploitable for potable&#13;
supplies) lies between 15 and 45 m below the water table for an area of 240 sq km. Total fresh&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 70                                       Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
groundwater reserves are estimated to be 210 million cu.m.&#13;
18.   In order to abstract only fresh water, it would be necessary to install doublet wells, with one deep&#13;
well (average depth 83 m) to draw the saline water away from the shallower (average 38 m deep)&#13;
freshwater well. The manageable yield with this configuration is estimated to be 8,640 cu.m/day, and it&#13;
is estimated that 100 doublet wells would be required. At this rate of abstraction the aquifer life would&#13;
be 66 years. To put the yield into context, the water demand for the seven etrap centers and seven&#13;
kolkhozes in the present project is 12,000 cu.m/day. The water wold be collected into a single&#13;
transmission main and pumped 60 km to the Tuyamuyun-Dashkhovuz pipeline, where it would be blended&#13;
with the Tuyamuyun water. As the Tuyamuyun-Dashkhovuz main is limited in capacity, the wellfield&#13;
would not therefore provide an additional resource, but would partially replace Tuyamuyun water.&#13;
19.    As a consequence of the method of abstraction, there will be 29,000 cu.m of saline water per day&#13;
to be disposed of at the peripheries of the aquifer. As well as adding to the cost, the environmental&#13;
consequences of these discharges would need to be assessed. The less saline water could be used for&#13;
agriculture, but this would require the establishment of farms in the area, and in such a manner that the&#13;
freshwater reserves were not compromised.&#13;
20.    The costs of the scheme have been estimated as US$ 84.5 million, assuming that the water would&#13;
be pumped to the Tuyamuyun-Dashkhovuz pipeline, then blended with the Tuyamuyun water. However,&#13;
if the scheme was constructed as an independent scheme (thus providing an additional resource for the&#13;
velayet) with a pipeline direct to Dashkhovuz, the cost would be US$ 240 million.&#13;
21.    As an independent source, the scheme would provide a small amount of water at a high capital&#13;
cost: in addition the supply of this water in itself would not meet the aim of the project, that is to direct&#13;
water supply improvements to as wide a population as possible. For these reasons it is considered that&#13;
the scheme is not appropriate for inclusion in this project, and also that it is not a viable source for&#13;
Dashkhovuz velayet.&#13;

ANNEX H: DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.    Three demonstration projects were designed during project identification and included in the nine&#13;
month project preparation consultancy (March 1996 - December 1996): (1) a school sanitation, hygiene&#13;
and health education project; (2) a community water supply system demonstration, and (3) an artificial&#13;
recharge demonstration project.demonstrate and health. Projects #1 and #2 demonstrated community&#13;
based approaches to water supply and sanitation. Project #3 was a technical project to demonstrate&#13;
artificial recharge of a well field to increase the volume of fresh water available.&#13;
2.     Project #3 was dropped from the project preparation consultancy due to lack of interest on the&#13;
Government's part - which largely resulted from the recognition that the nine month timeframe was not&#13;
sufficient to realize useful results. The Bank agreed with this decision.&#13;
3.    The two remaining demonstration projects were carried out from March, 1996 to December,&#13;
1996, under the project preparation consultancy with Electrowatt Engineering. Electrowatt sub-contracted&#13;
a local NOG, Assistance to Turkmenistan Area (ATTA), for the non-engineering components of the&#13;
demonstration projects. Local contractors were engaged for construction.&#13;
B. Results&#13;
4.     The demonstration projects provided an opportunity to introduce new, community-based&#13;
approaches to water supply and sanitation; to assess unforeseen problems in implementing aspects of the&#13;
overall Water Supply and Sanitation project (WS&amp;S); to identify of consumer demand, design parameters,&#13;
operation and maintenance of the water supply and sanitation systems; to develop community participation&#13;
activities for the WS&amp;S systems; to assess needs in health and hygiene education and develop appropriate&#13;
education materials; and initiate interaction between water and health sector staff as well as between the&#13;
community and local officials. The demonstration projects were designed and conducted in close&#13;
collaboration with the work of other NGOs and donors in the water supply and sanitation sector. In&#13;
particular, the school sanitation demonstration was developed by UNICEF staff participating in the project&#13;
identification mission and was coordinated with the UNICEF ASPERA school water supply and sanitation&#13;
project in Dashkhovuz. Thus the school sanitation project served to bring together those working in&#13;
WS&amp;S, including ATTA, and to build on one another's efforts.&#13;
5.     The demonstration projects were dynamic in nature. Results were evaluated by the community&#13;
and stakeholders throughout the project preparation period and adaptations made in the projects. Results&#13;
were presented during preparation in several workshops. The workshops served the added purpose of&#13;
providing a forum for participatory planning. Final results of the school sanitation and community water&#13;
supply system have guided the design of the sanitation and health component and the water supply and&#13;
institutional strengthening components of the project, respectively. Additional benefits of the projects&#13;
include the strengthening of skills and capabilities of a local NGO, ATTA, which was engaged in&#13;
execution of the projects. NGOs are rare in Turkmenistan, and ATTA's involvement in the project&#13;
preparation increased its visibility and scope of work.&#13;
6.     A brief summary of the demonstration projects is given below. Detailed project descriptions,&#13;
health materials produced, and technical drawings can be found in the Projects Documents File,&#13;

Main Feasibility Study Report" December, 1996.&#13;

C. School Sanitation Project (SSP)&#13;
7.     The SSP was implemented in one school in the project area, Boldumsaz School #15. The local&#13;
community was involved in the school site selection. A project committee was established and included&#13;
representatives from local government; local water and health offices; school administration; teachers;&#13;
students; and parents.   The project committee along with community representatives and local&#13;
administrators attended workshops to learn about school sanitation options and to choose the option most&#13;
appropriate for their school. The group chose to substantially rehabilitate and expand a communal pit&#13;
latrine. Local competitive bidding was used to select a local contractor for the construction work. The&#13;
existing facility was converted into a Ventilated Pit Latrine (VIP) with provision for future conversion&#13;
to pour-flush toils. Hand washing basins were installed. Construction was carried out during the summer&#13;
montsh when school was not in session. The project committee developed and O&amp;M program for the&#13;
new facilities.&#13;
8.     The SSP project was designed in a school in order to provide hygiene and health education to&#13;
the most receptive audience, children. The Social Needs Assessment, focus group discussions and&#13;
observation had made clear that there is no demand for improved sanitation in the region despite the&#13;
deplorable (to outsiders) conditions of sanitation facilities. Furthermore, it was clear that both the health&#13;
professionals and general population were largely unaware of the linkages between sanitation, hygiene&#13;
and health. Therefore, the SSP project was designed to include improved hygiene and health education&#13;
activities. Questionnaires were provided to students to assess hygiene and sanitation practices at school&#13;
and at home. Based on these results and discussions with health professionals, over summer months,&#13;
lessons on san sanitation hygiene and disease transmission were prepared with ATTA staff, teachers, and&#13;
health professionals. When school began, a five session teacher training program began to train the&#13;
teachers in the hygiene and health curriculum. The new curriculum has now been introduced and will&#13;
be part of the 1996-1997 school program. The health education program was closely linked to the new&#13;
sanitation facilities.&#13;
D. Community Water Supply System:&#13;
9.     Few, if any, of the public standpipes in the project area have functioning taps, with the result that&#13;
water runs freely from almost every connection during the service periods. Besides the huge wastage of&#13;
water, this practice also results in a decrease in pressure and thus a decrease in the service delivery area.&#13;
In many places the taps have been broken off. The demonstration project was designed to show the&#13;
benefits of strong, durable taps on standpipes with automatic shut-off valves as well as the convenience&#13;
of customer access to public standpipes. The technical components were coupled with a public education&#13;
program on appropriate use and maintenance of the public standpipes and a community based program&#13;
of site selection, standpipe design, and operation and maintenance. Since success of the technical&#13;
components of this demonstration rests with the community's safe use and protection of public standpipes,&#13;
a health education program was incorporated to present the benefits of safe water gathering and storage&#13;
and clean standpipes.&#13;
10.   The first step in the demonstration was the assess the water supply system in an etrap center.&#13;
Gubadag was chosen by local administrators. A community workshop was conducted in March, 1996,&#13;
and included administrators, local water and health officials, teachers, small enterprises, and community&#13;
members. The demonstration project concept was presented. It was determined that fourteen new public&#13;
standpipes would installed in a concentrated area somewhere in the city to demonstrate the aforementioned&#13;
benefits. Electrowatt staff worked with the participants to design an appropriate standpipe with a tap and&#13;
automatic shut-off. The participants chose a three block section of town for the site. The need for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                    Page 77&#13;
community survey on current water use practices was raised ; and a survey agreed upon and conducted&#13;
in May, 1996. The benefits of an increased water supply (due to the increased pressure and water&#13;
conservation) were quickly identified. Public housing residents said there would be less work carrying&#13;
water, more time available for other work, and improved personal hygiene. Single story families&#13;
identified the most important benefit as increased property value, improved personal hygiene and a&#13;
reduction in illness.&#13;
11.   Local competitive bidding was used to engage a local contractor to do the work. Design and&#13;
manufacture of the standpipes was done locally with local materials. Selection of the standpipe sites was&#13;
done by the residents of the city blocks involved. Construction of the standpipes were completed in July,&#13;
1996, and performance evaluation began immediately.  Almost immediately residents on the blocks&#13;
involved saw improvements in service delivery. The use of the shut-off valves increased pressure in the&#13;
pipes sufficiently to provide water at points not previously functional.  The new design, with&#13;
modifications made based on experience, was user friendly. The users of the standpipes evaluated the&#13;
performance with forms they had developed.&#13;
12.   The project developed health education materials (brochures) with comnmunity input on disease&#13;
transmission; use and care of public standpipes; water conservation measures; hygiene practices, e.g.&#13;
handwashing. These materials were distributed at all community meetings on the project; during the&#13;
survey. Health materials were given to the local public health services and to teachers. Teacher training&#13;
was conducted on use and care of standpipes and hygiene education.&#13;
13.    Results of performance evaluation were used to modify the design of the standpipes. Overall&#13;
results of the project have been incorporated into the design of the water supply component as well.&#13;
Health education materials continue to be reproduced and distributed in the commnunity. Results of the&#13;
health education activities were used to design the health promotion sub-component of the project.&#13;

ANNEX L: ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Project Impact and Envirornental Rating&#13;
1.    The Turkmenistan Water Supply and Sanitation Project is designed to improve the health and quality&#13;
of life of the target population by providing safe and adequate supplies of drinking water and improve&#13;
sanitation. Approximately 108,000 people living in the seven Etrap centers and 82,000 in nine collective&#13;
farms (including 62,000 new consumers) would benefit from improved water supplies. The project is&#13;
expected to have a positive impact on public health while maintaining or improving quality and quantity of&#13;
regional water resources. Rehabilitation of disinfection systems; leak repair; improved sanitation facilities;&#13;
and increased water delivery periods would reduce levels of bacteriological contamination in the drinking&#13;
water supplies. Technical improvements to the distribution system including leak repair and the provision&#13;
of automatic shut-off valves on public standpipes combined with public awareness and education efforts&#13;
would promote water conservation. Improvements to the water quality laboratories and training would&#13;
improve the region's water quality monitoring capabilities.&#13;
2.    The project has been assigned a Category 'B' rating.  Project activities involve primarily&#13;
rehabilitation and small expansions of the existing well fields, pipelines, and treatment facilities. No&#13;
resettlement or property rights issues would be raised since the project focuses on rehabilitation of existing&#13;
facilities. All works would be executed either within the premises of existing facilities, existing public streets&#13;
or publicly owned property. The project will not affect any archeological or historical sites. Under the terms&#13;
of the bidding documents, the contractors would be responsible for keeping worksites pollution free,&#13;
returning sites to their original condition, and minimizing dust, noise or other work-related nuisances.&#13;
Contractors would be responsible for notification to authorities of the discovery of any previously unknown&#13;
archeological or historic sites, and the suspension of work until decisions are taken concerning necessary&#13;
steps to protect such sites. The project will have no impact on the flow regime or quality of water in the&#13;
Amu Darya River, and therefore does not require notification for the purposes of OD.7.50.&#13;
B. Project Background and Environmental Issues&#13;
3.     Surface Water Resources. The study area is arid and is located in the lower plain of one of the Amu&#13;
Darya river, a flat plain gently sloping westwards towards the Sarykamish lake. The essentially agricultural&#13;
plain is marked by a dense network of irrigation and drainage canals. There are five large-scale irrigation&#13;
systems all taking origin from the Amu Darya. The main canals are: Shavat, Gazavat, Klychbay,&#13;
Dzumabaysana and Soviet Yab (now Kazak Yab). The latter excepted, the remaining four canals cross&#13;
Khorezm, an agricultural area in Uzbekistan, and receive the region's agricultural, industrial and municipal&#13;
effluents. The drainage of the irrigation water is conveyed into four large collector canals: Chagat, Atabent,&#13;
Ozemy, Daryalyk and the main Kunya Urgench. The collector main follows the trace of a fossil river bed&#13;
of the Amu Darya river and conveys the drained water into the Sarakamysh basin, a 40 meter deep&#13;
depression. The system has been in operation for thirty years and has created the present Sarakamysh lake&#13;
which has a total a surface of 3,000 km2.&#13;
4.     Groundwater Resources. Geologically, the Dashkhovuz area is a sedimentary basin formerly&#13;
occupied by a Neogene sea, constituted by a Triassic basement overlain by mesozoic-cenozoic deposits.&#13;
Neogene deposits with interspersed recent quaternary alluvia constitute a widespread shallower formation.&#13;
In general terms, shallow bearing deposits exist in the upper 20 to 30 m thick series of Neogene-Quaternary&#13;
sediments. These are underlain by a 90 to 120 m thick sequence of paleogene clays, acting as a regional&#13;
impermeable substratum to the shallower water bearing sediments. The shallow groundwater in the&#13;
Dashkhovuz Plain is generally highly mineralized, with total salinity between 15 and 30 g/l and generally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

increasing towards the depth.&#13;
5.     Piped Water Supply Systems. Recharge of the shallow aquifer occurs essentially through seepage&#13;
from the irrigation canals. Shallow aquifer lenses along the canals benefit by recharge of relatively fresh&#13;
water (salinity &lt; 1.5 g/l) from the canals. In comparison with the quality of the regional ground water&#13;
system, and the surface water, this system provides a relatively fresh water supply for the region. The&#13;
infiltrated canal water forms lenses of fresh water reaching a maximum thickness of 20-30 m beneath the&#13;
canal and becoming thinner progressively at perpendicular distances from the canal. The piped water supply&#13;
systems for both the etrap centers and the collective farms in the study use shallow wells adjacent to, and&#13;
as described above hydraulically linked, with an irrigation canal as the water source. These wells are&#13;
typically 10-25 m deep, and between 4 and 12 are provided for each system. Operation of the well fields&#13;
often does not follow well field rules recommended by hydrogeologist (due to malfunctioning equipment).&#13;
This may lead to a disruption in the design flow regime and increases the chances of drawing water of&#13;
relatively poor quality.&#13;
6.     Sanitation. Pit latrines are the only form of sanitation practiced in the project area. Although&#13;
household sanitation coverage is almost universal, the facilities are often in very poor condition and hygiene&#13;
is poor.&#13;
C. Project Activities and Impacts&#13;
7.     Piped Water Supply Systems. The project will rehabilitate and expand piped water system to seven&#13;
etrap centers and nine collective farms and provide a supply of spare parts and repair materials. The project&#13;
would repair existing street standpipes and provide new taps as required to provide space of about 70 m&#13;
between taps. The existing well fields will be rehabilitee and new borehole pumps and control installed.&#13;
Chlorination systems would be installed. The major environmental concern related to this component is the&#13;
impact on groundwater resources. Improvement to the wellfields would reduce water wastage and improve&#13;
water quality. In the seven Etrap centers the increase of the per capita water service would be achieved&#13;
through improvement of the distribution system and consequent reduction of the water losses. The need of&#13;
groundwater production will only slightly increase from the present 6,331 m3/day to 6,482 m3/day and&#13;
would have no consequence in the groundwater balance of the wellfields. In the ten collective farms, the&#13;
production of groundwater will increase from the present 155 m3/day serving 15,793 rural population to&#13;
2,461 m3/day for the needs of the rural population. The groundwater production potentials of the near-canal&#13;
groundwater bearing lenses identified on the basis of hydrogeological investigations and from inventory of&#13;
existing and programmed wells (as documented in the project feasibility report) appear in all cases large&#13;
enough to satisfy the required present and projected quantities of groundwater to be produced (Table 1).&#13;
Thus the induced recharge to the aquifer lenses from the canals is large enough to sustain increased&#13;
groundwater withdrawal projected at the horizon 2001 and there will be no impact on the hydrodynamic&#13;
equilibrium of the aquifers.&#13;

8.     Wastewater. Upon implementation of the water supply component of this project in the year 2001,&#13;
74% of the present population of the seven Etrap centers and 85% of the inhabitants of the ten collective&#13;
farms would have access to water supply delivered by standpipes at very accessible distance for each&#13;
household. Each Etrap center and rural inhabitant will have access to 48 and 26 I/day respectively. This&#13;
means 274 and 148 I/household per day in the urban and rural areas respectively. A large percentage of this&#13;
will become wastewater. The wastewater would result mostly from washing and other various household&#13;
activities. Currently, sullage is disposed of by putting it in a pit in the yard or reuse for gardens. Since the&#13;
project is not providing yard or household connections, and standpipe wastage would be reduced by use of&#13;
automatic valves, the project keeps any negative impact of wastewater at a minimum. Considering the large&#13;
spaces available and the arid climate, the current methods of wastewater disposal should continue to be&#13;
effective. Obviously, in the longer term, as households move towards house connections and flush toilets,&#13;
the wastewater disposal issue would need to be addressed.&#13;
9.     Sanitation. The project would involve rehabilitation of pit latrines and installation of hand washing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                  Page 93&#13;
facilities at schools and markets. The schools selected would be in villages receiving improved water supply&#13;
systems and the markets in the etrap centers, all of which are receiving improved water supply systems.&#13;
This component addresses the most urgent needs of unsanitary facilities and poor hygiene in communal&#13;
facilities and is not likely to have any adverse environmental impacts. As part of this component, water&#13;
quality monitoring and testing equipment, and training, would be provided to laboratories in each of the&#13;
etrap centers thus enhancing the regional water quality surveillance program. Health education activities&#13;
would complement the sanitation component and are an integral element of the overall strategy for improving&#13;
public health. No adverse impacts are likely to occur from these activities.&#13;
D. Overall Environmental Impact&#13;
10.   The overall impact of the project would be to provide an additional 108,000 urban and 82,000 rural&#13;
consumers with improved water supplies. The entire population of the velayet, 950,000, is expected to&#13;
benefit from the health and hygiene education program to the extent that this program has an impact on&#13;
changing hygiene practices and on health, especially among children. Both urban and rural populations&#13;
would benefit from improved sanitation at schools and markets. While providing better water supply and&#13;
sanitation facilities, the project would also strengthen management of the water sector by establishing a&#13;
regional water and wastewater authority in Dashkhovuz and strengthening management capabilities of the&#13;
new authority.&#13;
11.   Overall the project is envisaged to contribute substantially to the improvement of public health and&#13;
quality of life in the project area with no adverse environmental impacts.&#13;
&#13;

million over the years to finance consulting services in project management, procurement, and financial&#13;
management, local staff, training, equipment, and incremental recurrent costs. Construction Supervision&#13;
would receive and additional US $1.2 million for foreign staff, training, and equipment.&#13;
D. Record Keeping, Reporting and Evaluation&#13;
11.          PIU Record Keeping. The PIU would maintain records and accounts of all financial&#13;
transactions made with contractors, suppliers, and consulting firms. In addition, it would maintain records&#13;
of all project related reports prepared during the life of the project.&#13;
12.          Project Reporting. The PIU would prepare quarterly and annual progress reports on each&#13;
component and the overall project.  These reports would be prepared with inputs from the specific&#13;
implementing agency. The PIU would only consolidate the reports and prepare a summary of main findings&#13;
and recommendations (para 3.10). Reports would be submitted to the Bank.&#13;
13.          Project Component Monitoring and Reporting. Monitoring would be carried out in five&#13;
main areas: (a) the procurement and physical delivery of goods and construction contracts; (b) the physical&#13;
implementation of project activities; (c) the impact on service delivery; (d) the financial management and&#13;
control of project funds; and (e) the capacity building under the project. A systematic assessment would be&#13;
carried out in the context of the Project Implementation Plan (Annex ...), Performance Monitoring Indicators,&#13;
and, more specifically, the annual work programs. The indicators would be specifically indicated in the work&#13;
programs and then be reported in the quarterly and annual reports along with the basic financial infornation.&#13;
E. Financial Management and Accounting Control&#13;
14.          Chart of Accounts. The project financial accounting transactions and reports would use a&#13;
Chart of Accounts which would be maintained through regular posting of transaction detail and monthly&#13;
development of trial balances for all accounts.&#13;

status of accounts and progress against spending plans of the project. These financial reports would then be&#13;
consolidated and presented as part of the quarterly progress reports.&#13;
16.           Auditing and Control of Project Accounts. Annually, the project accounting and financial&#13;
records must be subjected to an independent audit by a certified professional auditing firm. To maintain&#13;
control of project assets such as capital equipment, the project would establish and maintain a system of&#13;
equipment and property control which provides for allocation of formal responsibility for all project-related&#13;
items through signed personal responsibility vouchers.&#13;

ANNEX R: FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    Data. All monetary figures are reported in 1996 US $, unless otherwise specified. The exchange&#13;
rate used is M.3,550 = $1.00, the average market rate in the second quarter of 1996. The official and&#13;
market exchange rates were unified in March 1996 when an auction system was introduced. However, at&#13;
September 1996 a 15% gap had arisen between the market rate and the auction rate.&#13;
2.     Data for costs of operation of the existing water supply operations are based on real (as opposed&#13;
to planned or budgeted) expenditures in nominal Manats for the first half of 1996, converted to dollars at&#13;
the exchange rate of 3,550.&#13;
3.     GDP data and inflation. There is considerable confusion about national accounts, due both to the&#13;
transformation from Soviet accounting standards and to the effects of very high inflation and currency&#13;
depreciation in 1993-1995. The following estimates for GDP, per capita GDP and inflation are taken&#13;
from IMF documents, but are not official figures.&#13;
1992      1993     1994        1995&#13;
GDP (mln Manat)                                     653      9,397    97,000    1,107,000&#13;
GDP per capita (US$, Atlas methodology)            1,49()     1,290    1,070       920&#13;
Retail price index (% change during period)         644      9,743     1,469&#13;
Consumer price index (% change during period)                          1,328       1,262&#13;
4. Nominal GDP in 1995 is estimated by the IMF at M.1,107,000 million. However, in September 1996,&#13;
Goskomstat estimated 1995 nominal GDP at M.464,457. The IMF reports a real reduction of GDP of 39%&#13;
between 1993 and 1995, due principally to declining gas production. However, gas still accounted for 51 %&#13;
of GDP (1995). Neither the Govemment nor the IMF has published official estimates of dollar GDP for&#13;
recent years. However, estimates made using the Atlas methodology show a sharp reduction, of 38%&#13;
between 1992 and 1995, in which year per capita dollar GDP stood at $920. Inflation (Consumer Price&#13;
Index, point to point) in 1994 was 1,328% and in 1995, 1,262%. However, following the implementation of&#13;
a stablilization program based on fiscal and monetary control, in the first 8 months of 1996, the&#13;
accumulated rise in the price index was down to 263%.&#13;
5.  Scope of this analysis. This annex presents a financial and economic analysis of the project, following&#13;
the guidelines established in the World Bank Handbook on the Economic Analysis of Investment&#13;
Operations (1996) and in the memorandum Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects, issued by the&#13;
Chief Economist of ECA dated February 29 1996. The main body of the analysis is divided into four&#13;
sections: financial analysis; analysis of the project's cost recovery mechanisms and fiscal impact; economic&#13;
analysis; and analysis of poverty considerations and affordability.&#13;
6.     The project has four components: water supply improvements, sanitation and health, institutional&#13;
strengthening, and project management and construction supervision. The quantitative economic analysis&#13;
presented here is limited to the water supply improvements component, for which the benefit stream is&#13;
well defined and quantifiable (the private benefits and externalities to be derived from increasing the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page  110                                       Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
supply of potable water).' The water supply component represents 70% of the total value of the proposed&#13;
loan. For the purposes of this analysis, the water supply project is disaggregated into the component for&#13;
upgrading water supply in seven Etrap Cities and that for nine Kolkhozes. This procedure has been&#13;
adopted because each component has clearly identifiable cost and benefit streams.&#13;
7.   Country context. The country context of Turkmenistan, detailed in Chapter 1, Section A of the SAR,&#13;
is problematic for a water and sanitation project. The Bank Group's program has developed slowly but&#13;
steadily in this environment reflecting the limited but growing Bank-Govemment dialogue on development&#13;
issues and approaches. A first Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has been prepared, at the&#13;
request of the Government, for discussion by the Board on May 27, 1997, together with the Urban&#13;
Transport project and this operation. The most important problem from a sectoral point of view is that the&#13;
Government is committed to a policy of public services, including water supply for human consumption,&#13;
free at the point of demand. This runs directly against the grain of the Bank's policies for sustainability in&#13;
water supply, via cost recovery from the users. No corporate framework exists within the sector; water&#13;
services are organized as government departments (variously local and national) and are financed on an&#13;
annual budget basis. There is considerable duplication of functions. The organizations responsible for urban&#13;
water supply in small towns are multi-purpose departments, also responsible for housing and communal&#13;
services. The project will address these problems through an institutional strengthening component which&#13;
will promote cost recovery and the creation of a specialized water and wastewater authority in Dashkhovuz,&#13;
subject to a new regulatory framework (see Annexes C, I and S-2).&#13;
Financial analysis&#13;
8.  Operational inefficiencies in the existing systems. The financial analysis is based on a comparison of&#13;
"with project" and "without project"scenarios for the costs and revenues of the water supply services in the&#13;
two groups of beneficiaries. Data for operating costs and water production in the first half of 1996 are&#13;
summarized in Table I . In each case, the water utilities' performance reflects the inadequacy of the existing&#13;
regulatory framework. In the first place, since capital resources are free to the utilities, there is little&#13;
attention to economy in their use. On average, pumps, which should last for between four and five years, are&#13;
replaced annually. The budget for replacing equipment is 58% of total expenditure in the Etraps and 59% in&#13;
the Kolkhozes; an efficient proportion would be below 20%.&#13;
9.  The distribution system is severely decayed, and the low pressure in the system has led to a vicious&#13;
circle, with the deliberate removal of faucets from street standpipes, in an effort to facilitate access to the&#13;
small amount of water which arrives, and resulting in astronomical physical losses (estimated at 80% by the&#13;
Consultants who prepared the investment plan).&#13;
10. As a result, in the seven Etrap Centers to be included in the project, water production is an estimated&#13;
2.3 million M3 per year, but only 462,000 M3 are delivered to clients. In the nine Kolkhozes to be covered&#13;
by the project, production is estimated at 370,967 M3 per year, but only 74,193 M3 are delivered to clients.&#13;
I For the other two components, the benefit stream is indirect. The institutional strengthening component seeks to improve sector&#13;
performance in the medium to long run through the creation of a unitary water and waste water authority in Dashkhovuz. The health&#13;
and sanitation component seeks to improve institutional capacity through technical assistance to the regulatory authorities and to&#13;
increase future demand for improved public health conditions through demonstration projects in sanitation. The Social Needs&#13;
Assessment revealed that at present there is little demand for improved sanitation; however, unsatisfactory sanitary conditions are&#13;
believed to be the principal cause of the high level of infant mortality from diarrhea. In the future, it should become feasible to&#13;
finance investment projects to improve sanitation, justified by the increased willingness to pay which the demonstration projects will&#13;
create.&#13;

In each case, this amounts to around 12 liters per person per day for the corresponding population. The&#13;
resulting op,erational cost per M3 delivered to clients is $0.59 in the Etrap Centers and $1.03 in the&#13;
Kolkhozes.&#13;

11. Due to the enormous losses and the deteriorated condition of the wells and pumping facilities, the&#13;
system is unable to achieve the designed pressures and supply volumes. In most places, there is supply in&#13;
the standpipes only four to six hours per day. In addition, overpumping of the wells in an effort to&#13;
compensate for losses in the system leads to high salinity in the water supplied, as well as further&#13;
contributing to the accelerated depreciation of the pumps. Virtually all the chlorination facilities are in&#13;
disuse.&#13;
12. Although in the Etrap Centers, an estimated 45% of households have yard taps and 5% have household&#13;
connections, these normally are not functional. As a result, the inhabitants must resort to coping strategies to&#13;
meet their water needs. Water is taken from wells, handpumps or (in the limited hours when it arrives) the&#13;
piped supply from the stand pipes. None of these supplies is treated with chlorine, and Dashkhovuz reports&#13;
the highest rate of infant mortality in Turkmenistan, a significant part of which is likely to be attributable to&#13;
water-related infections.&#13;
13. The systems also use electricity very inefficiently. This is a predictable result of receiving a supply at&#13;
the average price of $0.01 per KWH (marginal supply price is actually one tenth of this, as the fixed charge&#13;
for installed capacity accounts for most of the total). Pump sizes are normally inefficient and pumps&#13;
normally are run outside their optimal operating ranges. This results in very large consumption of electricity&#13;
per cubic meter of water delivered to clients. In the Etrap Centers, a reported 1.43 KWH are used for every&#13;
2 Operating costs do not include any element for the financial costs of capital investments, since these resources are granted&#13;
from the state budget. Although there is a depreciation provision in the HCS accounts for operating costs of the Etrap Centers water&#13;
supply, recent inflation has severely eroded the real value of the historic costs at which assets are depreciated, so there is effectively&#13;
no accounting for capital consumption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 112                                  Turkmenistan:Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
M3 of water produced. An efficient level would be around 0.4 KWH/M3. Although this inefficiency does&#13;
not result in a financial burden to the water utilities, because the electricity price is heavily subsidized, the&#13;
real economic cost of these wasted resources is considerable.&#13;
14. Project strategy to improve performance. The project will address these problems by rehabilitating the&#13;
existing production system, repairing and replacing pumps and boreholes, and installing automatic controls&#13;
to prevent overpumping and avoid pressure surges in the system. It will restore the chlorination systems and&#13;
replace as necessary the deteriorated pipes of the distribution network. Street stand pipes with improved&#13;
design, including automatically closing faucets and anti freezing devices, will be installed.&#13;
15. As a result of these improvements, physical losses are expected to be reduced to 20% and the system&#13;
will offer a reliable supply, between 12 and 20 hours per day, of drinkable water. The correct operation of&#13;
the wells will optimize the quality of the water and should gradually reduce salinity. Improved pressure in&#13;
the system will allow the water to reach the existing installed yard taps and household connections. This is&#13;
likely to lead to a steady rise in the proportion of households with yard taps and household connections,&#13;
since the Social Needs Assessment revealed a high preference for these, over the use of stand pipes. The&#13;
rehabilitated distribution systems in the Etrap Centers will have sufficient capacity to allow a doubling of&#13;
water supplied, with only relatively minor additional investments in production capacity (additional&#13;
boreholes and pumping equipment), up to 2011. At that point further expansion of the distribution network&#13;
will be necessary. In the Kolkhozes the distribution networks established with the initial investment will be&#13;
sufficient to absorb anticipated demand through 2017.&#13;
16. The following financial analysis, presents projections for 20 years of the impacts of the Etrap Center&#13;
and Kolkhoz investment programs. First, the assumptions made in each case are explained in detail. Then&#13;
the results of the projections are presented. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key variables&#13;
is presented at the end of the financial and economic evaluation.&#13;
17. "Without project" scenarios. It is assumed in each case that the physical and financial performance&#13;
registered in the first half of 1996 would continue unchanged over the proposed 20 year life of the project.&#13;
Data for a the first half of 1996 were used as the basis for the projection, due to the difficulty of&#13;
standardizing intertemporal series in the climate of high inflation / rapid devaluation experienced by&#13;
Turkmenistan in the last three years. For Etrap Centers, Table Al presents projected operating expenditure&#13;
and Table A2 presents projected net financial flows without the project. For Kolkhozes, the corresponding&#13;
tables are A6 and A 7. In each case, capital expenditure is set at zero because we are analyzing the people&#13;
covered by the existing system (expansions of the system would be alternative projects). Water produced&#13;
and delivered remain constant. Income is set at zero, on the assumption that without the project, the&#13;
Government would continue with its policy of 100% subsidies for water.&#13;
18. Cost recovery and its impact on demand. The Government is expected to introduce a system for direct&#13;
cost recovery from the users of the improved system (see paragraphs 51-60 below). However, it is expected&#13;
in the medium term that whatever mechanism is adopted for charging, it will be a flat rate system (in which&#13;
the marginal cost of water to the user is zero). For this reason, it was not necessary to estimate demand&#13;
elasticities in order to complete the financial analysis of the project (since the volume of demand will not be&#13;
affected by a flat rate tariff).&#13;
19. Demand projection - Etrap Centers (Table A3). In the "with project" scenario, production (called&#13;
"system demand" in the table) will be 3.7 million M3 in 2000 when the works are complete, compared with&#13;
2.3 million M3 produced in the "without project" scenario. The rehabilitation of the distribution network&#13;
allows the loss ratio to fall to 20%, so that delivery of water rises spectacularly, to 2.9 million M3 in 2000,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                               Page 113&#13;
compared with 462,000 M3 per year without the project. Thereafter, production and delivery are assumed to&#13;
grow steadily over the next 20 years, permitting (and responding to) a steady growth in demand,&#13;
attributable to a projected population growth rate of 2.2% within the area covered by the distribution&#13;
network, coupled with the gradual conversion of stand pipe users to yard tap or household connexion users,&#13;
which is likely to be stimulated by the increased reliability of the system. Yard taps and household&#13;
connections generate much higher per capita consumption than stand pipes, because the water does not have&#13;
to be carried. According to this projection, total annual consumption will more than doubled, from 2.7&#13;
million M3 in 1998, to 6.6 million by the year 2017.&#13;
20. Operating costs - Etrap Centers (Table A4). The profile of operating expenditure will be radically&#13;
altered, due to the imposition of efficiently designed and operated pumps. This would a) reduce the budget&#13;
for replacement of equipment from 57% of the total down to under 20% and b) reduce the consumption of&#13;
electricity from 1.43 KWH per M3 produced, to 0.33. The projection assumes that real salaries for system&#13;
staff will double, to allow the recruitment and retention of adequate professionals, but the total salary bill&#13;
will increase by under 10% in real terms, due to more efficient staffing policies. Finally, a provision has&#13;
been made for the cost of chemicals needed to operate the chlorination system; at present, there is little&#13;
chlorination. As a result of all these factors, total operating costs will be reduced by 7% between 1997-&#13;
2000, in spite of the fivefold increase of the volume of water delivered to clients. Thereafter, operating costs&#13;
will rise gradually, as increasing output pushes up the electricity and chemicals bills. It is assumed that the&#13;
other components of operating expenditure will not rise in line with output.&#13;
21. Cost and tariff calculations - Etrap Centers (Table AS). The average tariff necessary fully to cover&#13;
the total financial costs of the system, including the operating costs and the debt service of the loan which&#13;
finances the investment, has been calculated. The estimate assumes that the Bank loan will be for 20 years&#13;
with a 5 year grace period, and annual interest rate of 7.5%. The resulting 'full cost tariff' of US $0.42&#13;
per cubic meter gives a good measure of the average total cost of the water to be supplied by the revamped&#13;
system.&#13;
22. The cost is relatively high, due to the small size of the Etrap Centers, which makes both scale&#13;
economies in production and network economies in distribution elusive. It is also affected by the high&#13;
estimated capital costs, due to the difficulties of attracting contractors to execute projects in Turkmenistan.&#13;
The Consultant Engineers who prepared the project consider that 100% of the resources used in the&#13;
construction will be imported to the country - including the manual labor. This is consistent with the pattern&#13;
observed in other civil works contracts underway in the country, where Turkish and Pakistani manual labor&#13;
is being used.&#13;
23. Nevertheless, the proposed plan represents the least-cost solution for improving water supply in the 7&#13;
Etrap cities. The alternative of completing the unfinished aqueduct from Tuyamuyun to Dashkhovuz was&#13;
evaluated by the consultant and found to be far more costly; requiring $502 million to complete the works.&#13;
The engineers also considered the option of utilizing surface water (canal water) coupled with the&#13;
introduction of sand pressure filters, as an alternative to the existing borehole supply source. This option did&#13;
not report lower unit costs than the proposed project and was considered technically more complex, and&#13;
therefore rejected because it would increase project risks. However, the option of complementing the&#13;
revamped system with surface water and filtration should be kept open, in the event that salinity does not&#13;
fall in the well water following improved management of the pumping regime, since the surface water at&#13;
present registers lower salinity than groundwater and salinity is an important consideration in demand for&#13;
water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

24. The reported tariff is calculated on a cash-flow basis, using a discount rate of 12%. To simplify the&#13;
calculation, the depreciation rate on the investment is set equal to the amortization rate on the loan. This is&#13;
justifiable, as a twenty year life is a reasonable average for the types of investment being made. The tariff&#13;
calculated is an average total cost tariff, based on the whole output and costs of the system if the&#13;
investment goes ahead - it is not based on average incremental cost.&#13;
25. Since at present the water utilities in Dashkhovuz velayet have no charging policy, it is unlikely that&#13;
they will move directly to a full cost tariff. For this reason, we have also calculated a tariff sufficient to&#13;
cover the full cost of Operations and Maintenance ("O&amp;M Tariff'). This tariff, also reported in Table A5,&#13;
is US$ 0.14 per cubic meter. This is much lower than the full cost tariff, underlining the high weight of&#13;
capital costs in the full cost tariff, and also illustrating the expected efficiency of the operation of the&#13;
improved system. This tariff would be sufficient to cover the full cost of staff, repairs and maintenance,&#13;
electricity and chemicals at the existing unit costs of these inputs and at the efficiency (productivity) levels&#13;
projected by the project engineers.&#13;
26. Financial internal rate of return - Etrap Centers (Table AS). The expected financial internal rate of&#13;
return of the project (at market prices) is 10.7%, if a full cost tariff is applied. This rate of return is&#13;
calculated on the basis of incremental real incomes and expenditures which will arise in each period if the&#13;
project is implemented, compared with the situation if it is not implemented. The cost of investments is&#13;
registered in full in the year they are made and the debt service flow is excluded from the calculation.&#13;
27. Demand projection - Kolkhozes (Table A8). In the "with project" scenario, production ("system&#13;
demand" in the table) will be 1.98 million M3 in 2000 when the works are complete, compared with 0.51&#13;
million M3 in the "without project" scenario. In addition, the rehabilitation of the distribution network&#13;
allows the loss ratio to fall to 20%, so that delivery of water rises to 1.59 million M3 in 2000, compared&#13;
with 102,000 M3 per year without the project. Thereafter, production and delivery are assumed to grow&#13;
steadily over the next 20 years, permitting (and responding to) a steady growth in demand, attributable to a&#13;
projected growth rate from 2002 onwards of 2.2% of the population within the are covered by the expanded&#13;
network, and to the gradual conversion of stand pipe users to yard tap or household connexion users, which&#13;
is likely to be stimulated by the increased reliability of the system. By the year 2017, total annual&#13;
consumption would have tripled, from 1.3 million M3 in 1998, to 3.97 million.&#13;
28. Operating costs - Kolkhtozes (Table A9). The profile of operating expenditure will be radically altered,&#13;
due to the imposition of efficiently designed and operated pumps. This would a) reduce the budget for&#13;
replacement of equipment from 63% of the total down to under 20% and b) reduce the consumption of&#13;
electricity from 1.43 KWH per M3 produced, to 0.33. The projection assumes that real salaries for system&#13;
staff will double, to allow the recruitment and retention of adequate professionals, and staffing levels will&#13;
also be increased significantly from their present levels, which are too low for efficient operation. As a&#13;
result, the total salary bill will increase from just over $10,000 without the project, to a projected $66,600&#13;
with the project. Finally, a provision has been made for the cost of chemicals needed to operate the&#13;
chlorination system; at present, there is little chlorination. As a result of all these factors, total operating&#13;
costs will be doubled, from their present level of $105,000 per year to $216,000 a year in 2000, when the&#13;
works are complete. But this will be compensated by a fifteen-fold increase of the volume of water&#13;
delivered to clients (from 102,000 M3 a year now to 1.58 million M3 in 2000). Thereafter, operating costs&#13;
3 Since this discount rate is higher than the 7.5% interest rate on the loan, the project benefits from the high gearing (100% loan&#13;
financed) and the resulting tariff is lower than would be a tariff calculated on the flow of real expenditures. The net present value of&#13;
the flow of real transactions is negative at $2.8 million when the full cost tariff is levied (Table A5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                 Page 115&#13;
will rise gradually, as increasing output pushes up the electricity and chemicals bills. It is assumed that the&#13;
other components of operating expenditure will not rise in line with output.&#13;
29. Cost and tariff calculations - kolkhozes (Table A10). The "full cost tariff' (see definitions above, in&#13;
discussion of Etrap Centers) is US $0. 74 per cubic meter. The cost is higher than for the Etrap Centers, due&#13;
to the even lower density of the populations, which makes scale economies in production and network&#13;
economies in distribution elusive. As with the Etrap Centers, it is also affected by the high estimated capital&#13;
costs, due to the difficulties of attracting contractors to execute projects in Turkmenistan. Nevertheless, the&#13;
proposed plan represents the least-cost solution for improving water supply in the 9 Kolkhozes. The&#13;
engineers also considered the option of utilizing surface water (canal water) coupled with the introductioll&#13;
of sand pressure filters, as an alternative to the existing borehole supply source. The observations made with&#13;
respect to the Etrap Center project on this point also apply here.&#13;
30. The tariff needed to cover operations and maintenance ("O&amp;M Tariff") for the Kolkhoz project is&#13;
US$ 0.16 per cubic meter (Table A10). This is only slightly liigher than the $0.14 reported for the Etrap&#13;
Centers; the differences between the two projects' costs lie mainly in their capital-output ratios, not in unit&#13;
operating costs.&#13;
31. Financial internal rate of return - Kolkhozes (Table A1O). The expected financial internal rate of&#13;
return of the project (at market prices) is l0. 7%, if a full cost tariff is applied. As for the Etrap Centers, this&#13;
rate of return is calculated on the incremental real incomes and expenditures which will arise in each period&#13;
if the project is implemented, compared with the situation if it is not implemented. The cost of investments&#13;
is registered in full in the year they are made and the debt service flow is excluded from the calculation.&#13;
Fiscal impact and cost recovery&#13;
32. The fiscal impact of the project will depend on the cost recovery mechanisms adopted. If the&#13;
government applies a full cost tariff the fiscal impact of the project will be zero. If an O&amp;M tariff is applied,&#13;
the net present value of the implicit subsidy (the cost of the loan finance) for the Etrap Centers will be US&#13;
$6.4 million over the life of the project (calculated as the present value of the difference between the&#13;
projected income from a full cost tariff and projected O&amp;M costs - see Table A5). For the Kolkhozes. it will&#13;
be US $7.26 million (Table AI 0). The Institutional Strengthening component of the project will support the&#13;
Government to analyze options for charging for the improved water service and to reach a decision on&#13;
which option is most suitable for Turkmenistan at this stage. The following options are under discussion:&#13;
a) A flat rate user fee (earmarked tax) for all beneficiaries, to be collected directly by the HCS (Etrap&#13;
Centers) and either by the Rural Operations Department or (possibly) by the Kolkhoz authorities&#13;
(Kolkhozes).&#13;
b) A user fee differentiated between households with and without yard taps. Within this framework, a&#13;
possible option is a zero fee for users without yard taps. This would allow the project to comply with&#13;
the President's free water policy, since everyone can use the stand pipes. There might also be a&#13;
connexion fee for establishing yard taps, including a component for the direct cost of the connexion&#13;
and a component for increasing production capacity in the system.&#13;
c) A program to introduce metering for households with yard taps. This would be dependent on the&#13;
overall development of a commercial function and on the establishment of tariff levels sufficiently&#13;
high to allow the benefits from metering to offset the costs of the same.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 116                                 Turkmenistan:Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
33. In the initial stage, it is not recommendable to begin a metering program, due to the organizational&#13;
complexity of this sort of tariff system and the fact that there will be excess supply capacity in the system&#13;
for 10 years, according to the demand projections. The rationale for metering will grow stronger, in the&#13;
degree that total demand approaches the distribution system's capacity. In this context, it is important to&#13;
remember that the main economic benefit from metering arises from the double incentive:&#13;
a) To the user, to reduce his consumption at the margin, because this reduces his water bill; this allows&#13;
the water company to supply more water to other clients who derive a higher marginal utility from the&#13;
water.&#13;
b) To the water company, to increase the number of cubic meters supplied to clients (since this&#13;
increases the company's income); this gives the company a direct interest in increasing the efficiency&#13;
of production.&#13;
Economic analysis&#13;
34. Methodology. The economic evaluation of the two projects was undertaken by adapting the financial&#13;
analysis through the substitution of economic opportunity costs for financial costs, and the substitution of&#13;
the estimated economic benefits for the financial revenues. This section describes in general terms the&#13;
problems faced and the methodological decisions made in the course of the analysis and then presents the&#13;
results of the economic analysis for the Etrap Center and Kolkhoz projects.&#13;
Cost conversions&#13;
35. Numeraire. The analysis was undertaken in dollars at border prices. This was the most convenient&#13;
numeraire because the virtually the whole of the capital costs will be incurred in dollars.&#13;
36. Shadow exchange rate. The economy of Turkmenistan is still largely state controlled. Nevertheless,&#13;
considerable headway has been made on exchange and trade liberalization. At the time of the Pre Appraisal&#13;
Mission, there was a unified exchange rate, whose value was not significantly below the black market rate.&#13;
Import demand is highly elastic, but imports are virtually tax and duty free (there is a 2% excise tax on&#13;
which VAT of 20% is added, for a total of 2.4%). Although the regulation of the exchange auction can be&#13;
presumed to involve a significant degree of administrative channeling of foreign exchange towards state&#13;
corporations, in accordance with their planned resource needs, it was not considered practicable in the time&#13;
available for the present analysis to try to quantify the implicit tariff to which such procedures might give&#13;
rise. Turkmenistan's exports (gas, cotton, oil) are highly price inelastic. The country's strong natural&#13;
resource base has given it comfortable foreign exchange reserves and the expectation in the medium term of&#13;
a relatively strong currency (subject to the adoption of satisfactory fiscal and monetary discipline). In mid&#13;
1996 the exchange rate had stabilized and the monthly inflation rate had been reduced to single digits. For&#13;
these reasons, it was decided that it was inappropriate to presume the existence of a shadow exchange rate&#13;
above the market rate; the economic analysis was conducted using the average market rate of exchange&#13;
applicable in the first half of 1996 (M.3550 = US$ 1.00).&#13;
37. Conversion factors for domestic costs. As was mentioned above, the capital costs of the project&#13;
(including labor) are expected to be incurred almost entirely in foreign exchange; no conversion is therefore&#13;
necessary. The required revenue costs for imported materials such as chemicals have also been estimated&#13;
directly in dollars at border prices. Since Turkmenistan does not have a labor surplus economy, and in the&#13;
"with project" scenario it is presumed that there should be a 100% real wage increase, in order to attract and&#13;
retain adequate staff in the reformed water utility, it would clearly be inconsistent to apply a shadow price&#13;
for labor, lower than that amount.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                          Page II1&#13;
38. Electricity. The only component of operating costs which is clearly priced well below its economic&#13;
opportunity cost is electricity. Turkmenistan trades electricity internationally over the Uzbek border, at&#13;
prices ranging from $0.04 to $0.05 per KWH, both importing and exporting. During the last year, electricity&#13;
was imported to Dashkhovuz from Uzbekistan at the price of $0.05 per KWH. However, the average price&#13;
at which electricity is supplied to the water utilities is only $0.01. For this reason, a conversion factor of 5&#13;
was applied to the average price of electricity (raising it from US$ 0.01/KWH to US$ 0.05).4 This has an&#13;
important positive impact on the result of the economic analysis in the Etrap Centers, where the project will&#13;
reduce total electricity consumption.&#13;
39. Taxes. The capital costs include a tax component of 15% of the total investment cost. This cost has&#13;
been removed for the purposes of the economic evaluation.&#13;
40. Benefit estimate. The project will deliver an improved water supply to the populations which benefit&#13;
from the investment. Given the economic cost of the improvement in water supply (discussed in the&#13;
previous section), its economic rate of return depends on the value assigned to that water by the users (their&#13;
"willingness to pay", WTP) plus the value of any additional benefits to society which are not reflected in&#13;
WTP (externalities), such as improved health status, resulting in lower medical costs to the public sector&#13;
and in increased output whose economic value is greater than the private incomes to which it gives rise.&#13;
However, following standard practice in the evaluation of drinking water projects, this analysis concentrates&#13;
on the private benefits to be derived from increased water delivered, improved water quality, and improved&#13;
reliability of the water supply. No attempt is made to quantify possible externalities such as health benefits&#13;
and increased output due to a healthier population.&#13;
41. Normally, the willingness to pay for the improved service would be analyzed through a detailed study&#13;
of the revealed preference of water users who have access to different types of supply option at present, on&#13;
the basis of which, a demand curve would be estimated. Failing this, a willingness to pay survey would be&#13;
used to establish a contingent valuation for the improved service. However, in this case, no data of either&#13;
sort were available, because there is no relevant survey information, and the existing formal water supply is&#13;
not charged for. The following paragraphs describe the procedure used to estimate the value of the benefit&#13;
stream.&#13;
42. The economic analysis is based on an estimate of the increase in consumer surplus to be derived by&#13;
households as a result of the reduction in the time they spend carrying water and as a result of the increase&#13;
in their future consumption of water, due to the improved supply. According to the findings of focus groups&#13;
conducted during the Pre-Evaluation Mission, on average a household in Tagta spends 1.5 hours per day or&#13;
45 hours per month carrying an average total of 3.6 cubic meters of water to their house.5 This amounts to&#13;
4 It would be possible to justify an even higher conversion factor. Turkmenistan generates electricity using natural gas. It charges the&#13;
electricity company M.500 per thousand cubic meters. The border price of gas is M.213,000 ($40); this amount is expected to rise&#13;
during the life of the project, since Turkmenistan is planning pipelines to Pakistan and Turkey, where the selling price would be&#13;
between $60 and $80. At the present price, gas costs represent just 3.6% of electricity generation costs in Turkmenistan. However, if&#13;
the border price were applied, the price of gas would rise by a factor of 426 and the total cost of electricity would in consequence rise&#13;
by a factor of 16.3 (1630%). Nevertheless, since gas reserves are so great that there is no effective short term trade-off between&#13;
domestic consumption and exports. the analysis uses a more cautious basis for the shadow price estimation.&#13;
5 Unfortunately, the Household Survey conducted during the Social Needs Assessment did not gather data on time used fetching&#13;
water. It did attempt to produce willingness to pay data for an improved system. but used an open-ended question which invited&#13;
strategic responses, and did not in general comply with the standard requirements for producing valid responses in contingent&#13;
valuation surveys. The survey did not use the Referendum method; did not limit the consultation to one price per household; and did&#13;
not specify to the household what sort of service was being offered. Rather, it allowed the household to say what service it would like&#13;
&#13;

12.5 hours per cubic meter. This water is for all uses. In the present analysis, the time spent at present&#13;
carrying water is accounted for at the value it would have in the labor market at present. At the average&#13;
money wage of M.40,000 per month (1996, September) or $11.2, the average hourly wage (assuming a 20&#13;
day working month) is $0.07. Therefore the value of the labor time used to carry each meter of water is&#13;
$O.88.6&#13;
43. This is reasonable, because there is not a significant amount of unemployment in the Turkmenistan&#13;
economy. If anything, it may result in an underestimation of the likely economic value of the time savings&#13;
during the life of the project, because dollar wages are at present highly devalued, due to depreciation&#13;
outstripping domestic price and cost inflation during 1995-96, and can be expected to grow significantly&#13;
once the macroeconomic stabilization program is completed. Also, the economy can be expected to grow in&#13;
real terms during the life of the project, increasing the economic opportunity cost of the time which would&#13;
be spent carrying water if the project does not go ahead. However, for the purposes of this analysis we have&#13;
left the value constant in real dollar terms throughout the analysis; the benefit estimate reported here is&#13;
therefore a conservative one. In the following sections we describe the application of this methodology to&#13;
the Etrap Center and Kolkhoz projects and present the results.&#13;
44. Economic evaluation - Etrap Centers. Separate estimates are made for the gains in welfare from&#13;
improved water supplies for the users of: stand pipes; yard taps; and household connections (Table A13 and&#13;
Chart 1). In each case, a linear demand curve is estimated, with the form P = a + fQ, where P = price per&#13;
cubic meter, Q is cubic meters consumed per month and cx and f3 are constants which reflect the elasticity of&#13;
demand. The three estimated demand curves are based on:&#13;
a) The average amount of time spent per household at present carrying water, and the average volume&#13;
carried (this is the same for each category, because at present most yard taps and household&#13;
connections are inoperative due to the system's collapse. and everyone must use wells or standpipes).&#13;
This gives a point on the demand curve with a price per meter of US$ 0.88 and consumption per&#13;
household/month of 3.6 M3.&#13;
b) The estimated average consumption of unrationed households of 6 people facing a zero marginal&#13;
price for water with, respectively: a household connexion (23.4 M3 / month, based on 130 l.p.d. and&#13;
average household size of 6); yard tap (10.8 M3.) and stand pipe (6.3 M3). For yard taps and&#13;
household connections, the marginal price for the unrationed supply is zero (because the tariff is&#13;
expected to be a fixed charge). In the case of stand pipe users, it is assumed that the fetching time per&#13;
meter is reduced by 80% due to system improvements (better reliability and closer spacing of&#13;
standpipes). This gives an implicit price of $ 0.18 / M3 corresponding to the projected consumption&#13;
level of 6.3 M3 / month.&#13;
45. In each case, the welfare gain has two components: the cost saving from not having to carry water at&#13;
present (area A in the graph), and the welfare gain from the increased consumption (area B). For each type&#13;
of consumer, the average welfare gain per cubic meter consumed is calculated (Table A 13). The gain is&#13;
to have and then invite the respondent to say what they would like to pay for this service. For all these reasons, the resulting data&#13;
have not been used in the present analysis.&#13;
6 Another indicator of the alternative cost of coping strategies are the large private investments made by many households to&#13;
install wells, with both handpumps and electric pumps, to substitute for the inoperative piped water system. According to focus group&#13;
respondents, between 45% and 5% of residents in different etrap centers and kolkhozes have invested amounts equal in value to 1.5&#13;
months wages to establish such systems. However, these systems do not supply chlorinated water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                 Page  11&#13;
estimated at $0.51 per M3 for household connections; $0.59 for yard taps and $0.55 for stand pipes. On the&#13;
basis of these amounts, the total consumer surplus is estimated for each year, from the structure of&#13;
consumption in the demand projection (Table A14). As mentioned in the section on the financial analysis,&#13;
since the price of water will for the time being be zero at the margin, there was no need to adjust the&#13;
demand projection for the impact of possible tariffs. The results of the cost-benefit analysis are presented in&#13;
Table A14 The project has an estimated economic internal rate of return of 22.2%. A sensitivity analysis is&#13;
presented below.&#13;
46. Economic evaluation - Kolkhozes. The demand curves estimated for the Kokhozes are presented in&#13;
Table A17 and Chart 2. They differ in two ways from those estimated for the Etrap Centers. In the first&#13;
place, due to the larger average lot size in the Kolkhozes, estimate demand per capita with the improved&#13;
water system is higher, for yard taps and for stand pipes. In addition, average household size in the rural&#13;
area of Dashkhovuz is 7, compared with 6 for urban households, making for a further factor of adjustment.&#13;
As a result, monthly average household consumption is expected to be 27.3 M3 for a household connection,&#13;
14.7 M3 for a yard tap and 8.4 M3 for a stand pipe user. It should be noted that these volumes do not&#13;
include irrigation of private plots - the Kolkhozes have separate irrigation systems which use canal water for&#13;
this purpose.&#13;
47. The second important difference between the demand curves estimated for the Etrap Centers and the&#13;
Kolkhozes, is that the estimate of time presently used to fetch water is higher for the Kolkhozes. This is&#13;
reasonable, because they have a far inferior water service at present, with large areas outside the range of&#13;
the network, and the population density is far lower, so that traveling time to the available sources is likely&#13;
to be high. For these reasons, we have estimated an average time per M3 one third above that which is&#13;
prevalent in the Etrap Centers, giving an implicit price per M3 of $1.17.7 The resulting demand curves are&#13;
plotted in Chart 2. They imply a total welfare gain per M3 consumed from the improved system of between&#13;
$0.66 and $0.73, depending on the type of connection. Together with the demand projection for Kolkhozes&#13;
(Table A3), these values are used to calculate the projected economic benefit reported in Table A18. The&#13;
Kolkhoz project has an estimated economic internal rate of return of 10.6%, somewhat below that of the&#13;
Etrap Center project, due to the higher unit costs of production. A sensitivity analysis is presented below.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis&#13;
48. Table A19 presents the results of a sensitivity analysis for the financial analysis and economic&#13;
evaluation of each project. For the financial analysis, we explored the impact on the estimated unit cost of&#13;
production of varying the assumptions made on physical loss levels, population growth, the electricity price&#13;
and the discount rate used in the analysis. In both projects, the only factor which had any significant impact&#13;
on the tariff is the population growth rate, which affects the growth of total consumption. However, a large&#13;
change in the assumed growth rate in the Etrap Centers, from 2% to 3%, would only change the estimated&#13;
cost per M3 from $0.42 to $0.40; the change is similar for the case of the Kolkhozes. We can conclude that&#13;
the results of the financial analysis are robust in the face of all likely values of the most important&#13;
independent variables.&#13;
49. The sensitivity analysis for the economic evaluation investigates the way in which the economic&#13;
internal rate of return varies with key independent variables. Once again, it studies the impact of physical&#13;
losses and population growth, and finds their impact to be minor over likely ranges. The impact of changes&#13;
7 The hourly value of labor is estimated at the same rate in the Etrap Centers and Kolkhozes; according to household survey data,&#13;
per capita earnings are very similar in the two groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 120                                Turkmenistan:Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
in the shadow price assigned to electricity is also relatively small in the case of the Etrap Centers, and is&#13;
insignificant for the Kolkhozes.&#13;
50. However, the impact of the value assigned to the labor used to carry each M3 of water in the "without&#13;
project" scenario has a very important impact on the results of the analysis. This is because the estimated&#13;
demand curves and the associated estimates of consumer surplus flow from this cost (which is taken as the&#13;
implicit price of each M3 of water supplied in the "without project" scenario). For this reason, in each case,&#13;
we have calculated the value of this variable which would return an economic internal rate of return of zero&#13;
for the project. In the case of the Etrap Centers, the rate of return falls to zero when the imputed cost of&#13;
water at present falls to $0.21 / M3 (compared with the value of $0.88 used in the baseline case). For the&#13;
Kolkhozes, a zero rate of return is reached when the imputed price falls to $0.55 (compared with the&#13;
baseline assumption of $1.17. We can conclude that the economic opportunity cost of labor used for&#13;
carrying water, in each scenario, would need to be radically below that which we have assumed, before&#13;
either of the projects ceases to report a positive economric rate of return.&#13;
Poverty analysis and affordability&#13;
5 1. This section discusses the prospects for cost recovery in the social and economic setting of&#13;
Dashkhovuz. It briefly describes the economic situation of the country, then presents evidence on household&#13;
incomes and real and nominal wages from the Turkmen authorities and from the Household Survey (see&#13;
Annex B and the Needs Assessment report, November 1995 from the Project files for more details), and&#13;
discusses the political economy of public service provision in Turkmenistan in that context.&#13;
52. The economic situation in Turkmenistan. The Bank Group's program has developed slowly but&#13;
steadily in this environment reflecting the limited but growing Bank-Government dialogue on development&#13;
issues and approaches. A first Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has been prepared, at the&#13;
request of the Government, for discussion by the Board on May 20, 1997, together with the Urban&#13;
Transport project and this operation. The economy is highly dependent on the production of natural gas,&#13;
which in 1995 accounted for 51 % of GDP (data from the IMF). Turkmenistan is the world's fourth largest&#13;
producer of natural gas and has proven reserves sufficient for some 200 years' production at the present rate&#13;
of extraction. Following independence, Turkmenistan has had difficulty in exporting gas to the FSU states,&#13;
especially Ukraine, due to their inability to pay in hard currency. The accounting value of gas exports is $42&#13;
per 1,000 cubic meters, but 57% of this is paid for in barter, where goods are substantially overvalued, and&#13;
there are large arrears in cash payments. In an effort to press for higher real revenues, Turkmenistan has&#13;
halved gas exports to the FSU. As a result, production has fallen from 80 billion cubic meters a year at&#13;
independence, to around 40 billion at present. As a result, GDP has declined sharply in real terms.&#13;
According to the IMF, real GDP declined by 10% in 1993, 19% in 1994 and 14% in 1995 - a cumulative&#13;
reduction of 39%. Per capita dollar GDP has also declined sharply. Estimates made using the Atlas&#13;
methodology show a reduction of 38% between 1992 and 1995, in which year per capita dollar GDP stood&#13;
at $920.&#13;
53. Future prospects for GDP growth will depend on the development of gas, oil and agricultural&#13;
production. To increase value added in gas production, Turkmenistan will need to open new export markets&#13;
through the construction of pipelines to Turkey and possibly to Pakistan. However, the political problems&#13;
faced by this land-locked country in establishing such pipelines (through, respectively, Iran and&#13;
Afghanistan) are severe. Both the construction of gas pipelines and increased oil production will require&#13;
foreign investment, which will in turn depend on the extension of adequate guarantees to investors. In&#13;
agriculture, liberalization is needed in order to allow the countrv to maximize the income produced on the&#13;
limited irrigated territories in its possession.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

54. Household incomes in Dashkhovuz. GDP accounts are available only on a production basis; they are&#13;
not available on either an income or an expenditure basis. However, it is clear that the proportion of GDP&#13;
received as household disposable income is very small. According to the government statistical agency,&#13;
Goskomstat, in 1995 the average household monthly disposable income in Dashkhovuz velayet - where the&#13;
project is based - was M.13,587, or $68 at the average exchange rate for the year (Table 2).&#13;
55. However, according to the Social Needs Assessment conducted during 1995, monthly household&#13;
disposable income is even lower than the official figures suggest. Annual household income in Dashkhovuz&#13;
is reported as $355 (urban $336, rural $375); monthly income is therefore under $30 on average. The same&#13;
exchange rate was used for each of these figures, so the differences arise in the estimated value of income in&#13;
Manats. It is likely that the very rapid depreciation of the exchange rate during 1996 has resulted in a further&#13;
sharp reduction in the dollar value of household incomes. At the time of writing, the average wage is&#13;
M.40,000, which would correspond to a household income of around M.100,000 a month (assuming 2.5&#13;
incomes per household) or $20. This is much lower than the figures estimated for 1995, and reflects the&#13;
severe erosion of the dollar equivalent values of Manat incomes during 1996. However, this is likely to be&#13;
corrected in some degree once the stabilization program is complete.&#13;

on food (%)                                  _&#13;
56. The proportion of income used to buy food is relatively high. According to official data, food&#13;
expenditure is on average 58% of total expenditure. For rural households, the proportion spent on food is&#13;
lower (51%) and for urban households, it is higher (70%). The Social Needs Assessment estimated a far&#13;
higher proportion (85%). These data should be interpreted with care; the high weight of food spending&#13;
reflects in part the fact that a wide range of basic services are supplied either free of charge or at nominal&#13;
rates which are effectively free, including housing, electricity, gas, water, phones, health care and education.&#13;
Therefore, the high share of food in total expenditure is not an indicator of abject poverty, so much as an&#13;
indicator of the unreformed nature of the economic system.&#13;
57.  The proportion of GDP received as household disposable incomes is very low indeed. The official&#13;
data for household income imply a per capita annual disposable income of $117, which is around 13% of&#13;
per capita GDP. It appears that most of GDP is retained by the public sector and goes to finance state-&#13;
controlled investments and to subsidize the provision of food and free public services (including housing,&#13;
electricity, gas and water). This in turn reflects the slow progress on economic reform and privatization&#13;
registered since independence. The economy of Turkmenistan is still in the initial phases of the transition&#13;
from a Soviet-style planned economy to a market economy. Perhaps the most important part of that&#13;
transition is the shift from state control of consumption decisions, to private control. For that to happen, the&#13;
proportion of national income which is received as private disposable household incomes will have to rise&#13;
radically from its present low level. While the state retains some 87% of GDP and households dispose of&#13;
only 13%, there is always likely to be resistance to paying for public services: many people will feel (not&#13;
unreasonably) that they have a right to expect free or subsidized services out of the part of national income&#13;
which is retained in the public sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 122                                 Turkmenistan:Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
58. Turkmenistan is clearly at a level of development where the country is able to pay for piped water with&#13;
household connections for the great majority of its population. However, if this is done through a centrally&#13;
subsidized arrangement, with cash household incomes remaining low, then the resulting service is likely to&#13;
be inefficient. The state of the existing services in Dashkhovuz velayet is testimony to this. If, on the other&#13;
hand, public services were to be supplied at their full cost, on a pay-as-you-use basis, with the installation of&#13;
water meters, the system would be likely to be far more efficient. However, the distribution implications of&#13;
requiring the population to pay in full for their basic services, while their disposable incomes remain at the&#13;
low levels registered at present, are clearly unacceptable.&#13;
59. In this context, the issue of the affordability of water tariffs assumes a much broader significance.&#13;
Policy dialogue with the authorities should emphasize the potential efficiency gains to be had from tying the&#13;
incomes of the bodies responsible for producing services, to their delivery. It should also emphasize that the&#13;
result of privatization will be to increase the proportion of total income received by private individuals and&#13;
lower the proportion received by the state. While these issues clearly go far beyond the water sector, in the&#13;
interim, the institutional strengthening component of the water and sanitation project should also aim to&#13;
show that even with the collection of a limited user fee sufficient to cover operation and maintenance, the&#13;
efficiency of the system's operation can be greatly increased, compared with systems which depend on state&#13;
budget assignations for all their operating revenues.&#13;
60. The water tariff necessary to cover operations and maintenance in the present project, is estimated at&#13;
$0.14 and $0.16 per cubic meter in the Etrap Center and Kolkhoz projects, respectively. Households with&#13;
yard taps are likely to consume around 15 M3 a month - which would imply a tariff of $2.25 per month.&#13;
This would represent 7.5% of average monthly household incomes, on the income estimate made by the&#13;
Social Needs Assessment, or 3.5%, on the estimate of Goskomstat. At present (September 1996) incomes, it&#13;
might represent just over 10%. The establishment of a tariff in the range suggested is clearly not impossible;&#13;
in this context, it is also important to bear in mind that the provision of subsidized housing, power,&#13;
transport, health and education all help to reduce the pressure on the household budget.&#13;

Notes:         Collection rate:  90%&#13;
1. Tariff calculations are on a cashflow basis (see note 3.); depreciation is set equal to the amortization of the loan.&#13;
2. The financial IRR is calculated for the full tariff, on the basis of the net financial impact of the project (as defined in note 5 below).&#13;
3. Total cash flow is defined as total cash receipts less total cash expenditure (inc. debt service) in each period. Debt-financed capital expenditures are netted out of the flow.&#13;
4. Net real transactions is cash income less investment and O&amp;M expenditures. This includes the value of investments in the year they are made; it excludes debt service.&#13;
5. Equal to the net real transactions of the with project" scenario less the net income stream of the "without project" scenario.&#13;

1. Tanff calculations are on a cashflow basis (see note 3.); depreciation is set equal to the amortization of the loan.&#13;
2. The financial IRR is calculated for the full tariff, on the basis of the net financial impact of the project (as defined in note 5 below).&#13;
3. Total cash flow is defined as total cash receipts less total cash expenditure (inc. debt service) in each period. Debt-financed capital expenditures are netted out of the flow.&#13;
4. Net real transactions is cash income less investment and O&amp;M expenditures This includes the value of investments in the year they are made: it excludes debt service.&#13;
5. Equal to the net real transactions of the "with project" scenario less the net income stream of the "without project" scenario.&#13;

ANNEX S: TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
ANNEX S-1: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
ADVISORY SERVICES&#13;
A. Background&#13;
I.    The Central Asian Republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan&#13;
are involved in the Aral Sea Program, which was designed in cooperation with the United Nations Development&#13;
Program (UNDP), the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), and the Bank to improve environmental,&#13;
social, and economic conditions in the regions affected by the Aral Sea crisis. The Bank has taken a leading role&#13;
in the development and implementation of the Program, including donor coordination, technical assistance to all&#13;
projects, and capacity building assistance to regional institutions.&#13;
2.     The Velayet of Dashkhovuz is the area of Turkmenistan most affected by the crisis, being to the north of&#13;
the country and closest to the Aral Sea, and receiving its potable and irrigation water supplies from the irrigation&#13;
canals fed by the Amu Darya River. The water from these canals has in the past been heavily polluted with&#13;
residues from upstream industries, particularly agriculture, which has had severe effects on the health of the&#13;
population and agricultural production. The Velayet has a population of 951,000, of whom 300,000 live in&#13;
Dashkhovuz and eight etrap centers and 651,000 on collective farms (kolhozes), of whom only half have access&#13;
to sonme sort of piped supply.&#13;
Existing Water Supplies.&#13;
3.     The principal potable water sources for the project area are the irrigation canals fed from the Amu Darya&#13;
River, augmented by small quantities of groundwater in areas distant from irrigation canals. The potable water&#13;
supplied in the velayet is obtained from boreholes, which abstract from the shallow aquifers adjacent and&#13;
hydraulically linked to the irrigation canals. The quality of the borehole water is highly dependant on the quality&#13;
of water in the irrigation canals, as the effect of the shallow aquifer is limited to filtering out suspended solids.&#13;
The boreholes are typically 10 to 25 m deep, and between 4 and 12 are provided for each system, depending on&#13;
the size of the settlement and the well performance. The water is pumped to a nearby ground reservoir where&#13;
chlorine is added. The distribution pump station then draws water from the reservoir and pumps directly into the&#13;
distribution system.&#13;
4.     Maintenance of the water supply systems falls far below acceptable standards, as a result of lack of spares&#13;
and chemicals, and inadequate funding. Very few of the systems have operating chlorination systems, with the&#13;
result that water is usually delivered to supply with no disinfection. Pumps and pumping station pipe work is&#13;
usually a mixture of different sizes and types of equipment, much of it broken down, which leads to frequent&#13;
supply failures. In most towns, water is provided for between 4 and 6 hours per day, and often this limited supply&#13;
does not reach consumers at the extremities of the distribution systems. The systems themselves suffer from high&#13;
leakage and frequent bursts.&#13;
5.    The majority of the population are supplied through street standpipes, although some households have yard&#13;
taps, and in Dashkhovuz city there are a limited number of house connections. Because system operation is often&#13;
limited to 6 hours per day, the street standpipes are either broken or missing, so that a large proportion of the&#13;
water supplied by the system runs to waste. Similarly, yard taps are often left on, and water collected in&#13;
containers, or left to run into gardens.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

B. Project Objectives&#13;
6.     The objectives of the proposed project are to: (i) improve water supply and sanitation in seven etrap centers&#13;
and nine collective farms in Dashkhovuz velayat; and (ii) initiate institutional changes in the water and sanitation&#13;
sector to ensure that the project is financially and technically sustainable. The proposed project will comprise&#13;
four main components: (a) water supply improvements: (b) sanitation and health; (c) institutional strengthening;&#13;
and (d) project management and construction supervision.&#13;
C. Overall Project Management&#13;
7.    Implementation of the specific components would be the responsibility of the respective implementation&#13;
agency (Ministry of Health (MOH) for the Sanitation and Health Component, the Ministry of Water Resources&#13;
(MWR) for the Institutional Strengthening Component, and the local authorities in Dashhawuz Velayat and the&#13;
participating etraps for the Water Supply and Distribution Improvements Component). To support project&#13;
management and coordination responsibility, a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been established to support&#13;
and coordinate overall project activities including, administration, project planning, organizational development,&#13;
operating procedure development, implementation oversight, training, and technical assistance coordination. The&#13;
PIU is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of Bank Guidelines on procurement of services and goods&#13;
are understood and met, as well as disbursement responsibilities. In addition to overall coordination, the PIIJ&#13;
would be responsible for common implementation functions such as project accounting, procurement,&#13;
disbursements, consolidation of quarterly and annual progress reports, and annual work programs and budgets.&#13;
The PIU would also provide training and technical assistance coordination, project supervision, and assistance to&#13;
the Component Coordinators (CCs).&#13;
8.     The PIU reports to the Deputy Minister of Water Resources, responsible for Construction and Operations.&#13;
It is being staffed with a Director (local), an Economist (local), a Health Specialist (local) an&#13;
Accountant/Disbursement Expert (local), an interpreter/translator (local), a Secretary (local), a Project Management&#13;
Specialist (foreign), and a Procurement Specialist (foreign). In addition, the project will finance a limited number&#13;
of short-term consultants such a Financial Management Specialist, and a Computer Specialist (to help design a&#13;
Project Management and Information System). The PIU will be provided with suitable office space, and local&#13;
communications, and office equipment, although the consultants should be prepared to arrange for their own&#13;
logistical support in transportation, international communications and lodging.&#13;
9.     The project is expected to be approved by the World Bank Board by end of May 1997. The loan is&#13;
expected to be effective by end of August 1997. The PIU has begun operations with financing from an advance&#13;
approved by the Bank in November 1996 (PPF). The consultant services for project management, administration&#13;
and construction supervision (this contract) will be divided into two phases: (i) establishment of the PIU and&#13;
preparation and execution of initial procurement actions for the major technical assistance contracts to the MWR&#13;
and the participating velayat; (ii) continued procurement of necessary consultants, initiation of purchasing of&#13;
material and equipment, and setting up arrangements for rehabilitation of selected facilities; supervising on-going&#13;
work and providing general support for policy and operational aspects of the project's execution to the project's&#13;
conclusion. In addition, the consultant will be expected to train PIU staff and Component Coordinators (CCs) in&#13;
the implementing agencies/departments in how to meet Bank Guidelines, operating procedures and reporting&#13;
requirements, and design and implement a Management Information System for project activities. Consultants&#13;
selected for phase one will be expected, if performance warrants and Loan funding becomes available, also to&#13;
provide services in the second phase.&#13;
D. PIU Functions&#13;
10.    The PIU is the focal point for the project and is responsible for its overall coordination. The PIU headed&#13;

E. PIU Organization and Staffing&#13;
12.   The PIU is being headed by a Director with demonstrated management and engineering abilities, and&#13;
knowledge of local budgetary processes, and vested with authority to carry out the responsibilities of the PIU at&#13;
the ministerial level and act as project spokesperson in relations between the implementing agencies and the Bank.&#13;
For the Water Supply Improvement and the Institutional Strengthening Components, the PIU will act as the&#13;
coordinator of necessary inputs to the velayet and etraps, and facilitate the execution of the technical services&#13;
offered to the etraps&#13;
F. Scope of the Consulting Services&#13;
General&#13;
13.    The services will be provided by a consulting firm (consultants) over a 40 month period starting from four&#13;
weeks after contract signature.  The (consultants) firm  will be responsible for assisting the PIU and the&#13;
implementing agencies in setting up systems and managing and executing their procurement actions. In addition,&#13;
the consultants will provide selected technical inputs to the activities financed under the Water Supply Component,&#13;
which while executed and directly connected to relevant agencies of the implementing velayat and etrap&#13;
administrations, will depend administratively upon the PIU for contract administration and support. Accordingly,&#13;
the first six months (phase one) will be dedicated to intense assistance to the PIU and the implementing agencies&#13;
in pre-contract award activities including design of a Project Financial and Management Information System&#13;
covering procurement, status of project components, and Project Work Programs and Budgets. Short term&#13;
specialized consultant services are expected during this phase to help design the Project Management Information&#13;
System. In addition, during this Phase One, and assuming Loan effectiveness and the availability of Loan funding,&#13;
a review of consultant performance will be carried out and, if positive, authorization will be given for the&#13;
consultant to proceed with Phase Two Activities.&#13;
14.   Phase Two will involve managing the day-to-day operations of the PIU in procurement, financial and&#13;
accounting systems, information systems, and monitoring and coordination activities as well as initiation of the&#13;
procurement of equipment and material and the design and execution of rehabilitation activities.&#13;
G. Implementation of Components&#13;
15.   The respective agencies would be responsible for implementation of their components. As noted before,&#13;
the Project Implementation Unit would be responsible for overall project coordination. At the level of Dashhawus&#13;
Velayat, a PIU Regional Coordinator (RC) has been appointed to coordinate/oversee all project activities for the&#13;
velayat.  In addition to the RC, Component Coordinators (CCs) would be appointed for each of the three&#13;
components. The Regional Coordinator also serves as Component Coordinator for the Institutional Strengthening&#13;
Component. Two CCs would be appointed for the Sanitation and Health Component (Sanitary Epidemiological&#13;
Services and Center of Health), and one for the Construction Management Component. The CCs would be the&#13;
focal points for all project activities related to their components. The CCs, through the RC would be the first&#13;
point of contact between MOH, the PIU, the Bank, and the PC. These arrangements would remove the need to&#13;
create separate structures within each implementing agency. A seminar was held during Project Appraisal, with&#13;
the participation of staff of the PIU and key officials of implementing agencies for better understanding of the&#13;
project, and proposed implementation arrangements. In addition, a project launch workshop will be organized&#13;
immediately after Board Presentation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 150                                     Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
16.   With support from technical assistance, all CCs would be responsible for coordinating the planning and&#13;
implementation of project activities in their respective components. Specifically, the CCs would be responsible&#13;
for the preparation of the annual work programs and budgets. The CCs would also help ensure that project&#13;
accounts and records are maintained, and that supporting documentation is kept in an organized manner for the&#13;
preparation of funding requests from the Special Account. In addition, they would be responsible for the&#13;
preparation of quarterly and annual progress reports. At the velayat level, the CCs would be responsible for&#13;
coordinating the planning and implementation of project activities at the etrap level, consolidating the annual work&#13;
programs and budgets and ensuring that the project financing requirements are incorporated in the velayat budgets&#13;
before they are sent to the PIU and subsequently to the MO during the annual budget preparation process. They&#13;
would also review and consolidate the annual programs and annual reports before they are sent to the PIU.&#13;

ANNEX S-2: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING COMPONENT&#13;
GENERAL INFORMATION&#13;
Background&#13;
Turkmenistan achieved political independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. At that time the country inherited&#13;
the organizational structure of the former Soviet Union for the provision of water, sanitation and wastewater&#13;
services (the sector). Essentially that system assigned responsibility for the sector to the Ministry of Housing and&#13;
Commnunal Services (MHCS), and the operating utilities at the municipal level had little control over the planning,&#13;
design, funding or construction of the facilities they were charged to operate. Turkmenistan continued that system&#13;
in the early years of its independence, but then abolished the MHCS as a ministry and converted the regional or&#13;
velayet offices of the MHCS to "trusts" with substantially the same responsibilities they had before when they&#13;
reported to a central ministry instead of to a velayet. However, there is a lack of clarity about the roles of the&#13;
many national and regional (velayet) organizations with responsibilities that effect the sector, and this confusion&#13;
adversely impacts on the abilities of the local sector utilities to meet their obligations.&#13;
Purpose&#13;
The goals of the Turkmenistan Water Supply and Sanitation project are to (1) improve water supply and sanitation&#13;
in seven etrap capital cities and nine collective farms in Dashkhovuz Velayet and (2) initiate institutional changes&#13;
in the water and sanitation sector to ensure that the project is financially and technically sustainable. The project&#13;
has four components: (1) water supply systems (2) sanitation and health (3) institutional strengthening and (4)&#13;
project management and construction supervision. This consultancy addresses the institutional strengtheing&#13;
component and the consultancy's purpose is to develop and improve the institutional capacity to operate and&#13;
maintain the water supply and sanitation improvements. The scope of work tasks are divided into three parts,&#13;
described as follows:&#13;
1.    National Sector Reform Study The first part is to conduct a study, make recommendations and develop&#13;
an action plan for making improvements at the national level to strengthen the capacity in Turkmenistan to provide&#13;
water and wastewater services more effectively to the country's 4.5 million people. This study is intended to&#13;
reconmmend changes that will provide the support necessary to accomplish the second part, the establishment of&#13;
a regional sector utility authority in Dashkhovuz.&#13;
2.     Establish a New Regional Sector Organization The second part is to evaluate existing sector capabilities&#13;
within Dashkhovuz Velayet, to provide specific commendations and draft necessary legislation for the creation of&#13;
a new regional water and sanitation authority in the Velayet, and to assist the government in establishing this new&#13;
authority.&#13;
3.    Strengthen the New Regional Sector Organization The third part will provide institutional strengthening&#13;
of the new authority in order to develop the skills and capabilities within the authority to meet its responsibilities.&#13;

PART III - STRENGTHENING THE NEW REGIONAL SECTOR AUTHORITY&#13;
TASKS TO BE PERFORMED&#13;
The basic intent of Part III is that the consultant will assist the Authority in improving its institutional capacity&#13;
through the implementation of the consultant's recommendations arising from the completion of the tasks described&#13;
in Part II. The tasks described below assume that the Authority will be established not later than 12 months from&#13;
the start of work under the consultant's scope of work, and that an additional 12 months will be available to&#13;
implement these tasks. It is unlikely that the consultant will be able to assist the new Authority to obtain full&#13;
capability in all the subjects described in this section. The tasks have been framed as actions required to achieve&#13;
goals, but with the understanding that attainment of these goals will be dependent to a large extent upon factors&#13;
not under the control of the consultant. Such factors include the timing and extent to which the Authority actually&#13;
exists, in terms of its charter; the capacity and suitability of assigned personnel and office quarters; and such&#13;
physical resources as office furnishings and equipment, vehicles, and spare parts and materials for operation and&#13;
maintenance of facilities.&#13;
Task A        Strengthen Authority's Administration and Management Capabilities&#13;
Background Administration and management are broad terms which embrace the policies, procedures, systems&#13;
and skills necessary for conducting all the operations that permit the Authority to fulfill its obligations as the&#13;
organization responsible for water supply, sanitation and wastewater services throughout the Velayet. There are&#13;
many alternatives for dividing these responsibilities between the Managing Director of the Authority and a&#13;
separate department of administration. The consultant will perform the following tasks:&#13;
Task A. 1     Develop Key Polices and Procedures&#13;
Compile and review significant policies and procedures now in effect, or under consideration, that relate to the&#13;
Authority's responsibilities. Revise the key existing or draft policies and procedures and develop new policies and&#13;
procedures as appropriate. Review all such policies and procedures with the Authority. Based on that review,&#13;
prepare and translate new policies and procedures for the Authority.&#13;
Task A.2      Establish Program for Computer Technical Support&#13;
Develop a computer technical support center and train staff to implement the responsibilities of this center. The&#13;
consultant will determine the duties and responsibilities of this center, but they should include the capability of&#13;
training staff in other divisions of the Authority to provide essential employees with needed skills in word&#13;
processing, spread sheets, accounting programs, desk top publishing or other computer skills required for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                     Page 169&#13;
performance of the duties of their divisions. The center should also serve as a source of technical support and&#13;
troubleshooting, and in \the development of new programs to enhance the capabilities of the various divisions of&#13;
the Authority.&#13;
Task A.3      Establish Basic Management Information System&#13;
Review the current level and type of information being generated, and the procedures for distribution of such&#13;
information. Based on the results of this study, develop and implement a program for the determination of what&#13;
type of information is required for senior and middle level managers, the level of detail to be provided, its&#13;
frequency, and assignment of responsibilities for the preparation and dissemination of the desired information.&#13;
These activities will be used to develop a comprehensive management information system for the Authority. The&#13;
purpose of this effort is the prompt provision of accurate information to key managers sufficient to support&#13;
decision-making or other actions leading to the achievement of the Authority's goals.&#13;
Task A.4      Define and Develop a Legal Office&#13;
Prepare a description of duties and responsibilities for an internal legal office within the Authority. Duties are&#13;
expected to include review and recommendations for approval of all contracts which the Authority is planning to&#13;
execute, advice to the Managing Director on any potential legal problems arising from the Authority's activities,&#13;
interpretation of GOT laws that may constrain the Authority's ability to function autonomously, or any other legal&#13;
matter which may arise. This probably should be a single lawyer with a small administrative staff, with occasional&#13;
support from staff on loan from other departments during peak workloads.&#13;
Task A.5      Define and Develop an Internal Audit Capability&#13;
Prepare a description of duties and responsibilities for an internal audit office within the Authority. The internal&#13;
audit office should be independent of the financial division, and should have such responsibilities as reviewing all&#13;
of the Authority's financial dealings, suggesting changes in policies and procedures to ensure strict accountability&#13;
of all revenues and expenses, and advising the Managing Director of any inadequacies or potential problems&#13;
relative to the Authority's financial practices. This office should also monitor compliance of the financial&#13;
department with GOT laws and regulations that affect utility financial activities. Staffing of an internal audit office&#13;
will be dependent upon the extent to which financial activities of the Authority are to be reviewed.&#13;
Task A.6      Define and Develop a Public Relations Capability&#13;
Prepare a description of duties and responsibilities for a public relations office within the Authority, and an outline&#13;
plan of action for this office. Public support will be critical to the success of the Authority as an effective sector&#13;
utility organization meeting the needs of the Velayet.  Possible activities include the development and&#13;
implementation of a program to routinely inform customers of the Authority's activities of benefit to customers&#13;
and the various communities of the Velayet, to respond to adverse media publicity, to educate customers about&#13;
the need for adequate user fees, to develop means of communicating information to employees and fostering&#13;
improved staff morale, and to conduct activities in any other areas in which the Authority could obtain benefits&#13;
in improving its public image so as to further its goals of autonomy and sustainability. Initially this office&#13;
probably should consist of a single professional person and a small administrative staff, with occasional support&#13;
from staff on loan from other departments as the workload requires.&#13;
Task A.7      Define and Develop a Customer Services Capability&#13;
Prepare a description of duties and responsibilities for a customer services office within the Authority. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 170                                      Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
purpose of this office is to serve the interests of the customers. Possible activities include the opening and&#13;
publication of a customer complaint telephone line, development and implementation of a program to train and&#13;
assign people to answer the phones, transmit the complaints to the appropriate department, and follow up to ensure&#13;
that legitimate complaints are addressed. This office should be sympathetic to, and, to the extent possible,&#13;
encourage the development of, consumer action groups in Dashkhovuz Velayet. This office would serve the&#13;
function of "ombudsman", or in-house representative of the interests and concerns of the Authority's customers.&#13;
Such a function will, in the long run, enhance the Authority's public image as a caring organization. This office&#13;
probably should consist of the customer's representative, and a small staff to answer phones and assist the&#13;
representative in ensuring that complaints are addressed promptly.&#13;
Task A.8      Define and Develop an Improved System of Stores and Parts Management&#13;
Based on the evaluation of existing conditions and assessment of future needs, recommend a new system of stores&#13;
and parts management, including record keeping and the development of physical facilities. Assist the Authority&#13;
in developing a basic capacity for this purpose which is appropriate for the initial needs of the Authority.&#13;
Task A.9      Define and Develop a Capability for Vehicle and Transport Management&#13;
Based on the evaluation of existing conditions and assessment of future needs, recommend a new system of&#13;
vehicle, heavy equipment and transport management, including allocation of such facilities based on priority needs.&#13;
The system should include record keeping, repairs and physical facilities such as garages and maintenance and&#13;
repair equipment. Assist the Authority in developing a basic capacity for this purpose which is appropriate for the&#13;
initial needs of the Authority.&#13;
Task B        Strengthen the Authority's Technical and O&amp;M Capabilities&#13;
Background There are several categories of technical expertise which require strengthening to better serve the&#13;
Authority's needs. These include (1) long-term planning, (2) operation, maintenance and repair of the physical&#13;
works of the system and also of the Authority's buildings and equipment, (3) mapping and record keeping, (4)&#13;
construction management, (5) basic design of standards for commonly needed facilities (building connections,&#13;
latrines and procedures or facilities for emergency repairs), (6) management of wastewater, septage and latrine&#13;
waste disposal, and (7) capability to procure and monitor the services of private sector engineers for conducting&#13;
feasibility studies and the design of major new works.&#13;
Task B. 1     Reorganize the Technical Department&#13;
Suggest an appropriate organization of the technical department which ensures the establishment of sections, and&#13;
appoints section leaders, with responsibilities for the proposed divisions and sub-divisions of the department,&#13;
including those described in the following tasks.&#13;
Task B.2      Define and Develop Planning Capabilities&#13;
Define the Authority's planning needs, in terms of the purpose and the information needed upon which to base&#13;
such plans. The basic purposes of planning should include an identification of the description, size, type, location&#13;
and cost of facilities needed to meet future demands, either from growth in new areas or increased water needs,&#13;
wastewater flows or latrine wastes from existing customers, as estimated for various periods in the future.&#13;
Similarly, the planning should identify the need to replace aging components of the system as they reach the end&#13;
of their useful life. Develop the capability within the Authority to identify planning needs, conduct the planning,&#13;
ensure that these plans are subject to review and approval, and that the approved plans become the basis of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

estimated costs for capital development and replacement needs incorporated in long-term financial planning. In&#13;
some organizations, the long-term planning function is part of the office of the Managing Director of the&#13;
Authority.&#13;
Task B.3      Define and Develop O&amp;M Capabilities&#13;
Based on the evaluation of existing O&amp;M capabilities, assess the Authority's O&amp;M needs, in terms of both the&#13;
Authority's facilities for providing sector services such as wells, pipelines and pump stations, and also for its own&#13;
buildings, laboratories and equipment. Develop a system for guiding operators in the proper operation of all&#13;
facilities, and for both periodic, preventive maintenance, and routine and emergency repairs. Assist the Authority&#13;
in developing a basic capacity for these purposes which is appropriate for the initial needs of the Authority.&#13;
Task B.4      Define and Develop Mapping and Record Keeping Capabilities&#13;
Based on the evaluation of existing conditions and assessment of future needs, recommend a new system of&#13;
mapping and record keeping. The mapping and record keeping should make use of the identification of the&#13;
description, size, type, location and condition of facilities as described in Task B.2.  Assist the Authority in&#13;
developing a basic capacity for this purpose which is appropriate for the initial needs of the Authority.&#13;
Task B.5      Define and Develop Construction Management Capability&#13;
Based on the evaluation of existing conditions and assessment of future needs, recommend a program for&#13;
developing a capability within the Authority for managing and supervising the construction of facilities which are&#13;
being constructed by others for the Authority. Assist the Authority in developing a basic capacity for this purpose&#13;
which is appropriate for the initial needs of the Authority, making full use of the water supply improvement&#13;
program which is part of this project. This task should be closely coordinated with the services being provided&#13;
by the project management contractor.&#13;
Task B.6      Define and Develop Basic Design Capabilities&#13;
Based on the evaluation of existing conditions and assessment of future needs, recommend a program for&#13;
developing a capability within the Authority for preparing basic designs. Basic designs are considered to be those&#13;
required for making standard drawings for repetitive works such as customer service connections to the Authority's&#13;
pipelines, improvements to street faucets, designs required on short notice for emergency repairs, and similar&#13;
purposes. Assist the Authority in developing a basic capacity for this purpose which is appropriate for the initial&#13;
needs of the Authority.&#13;
Task B.7      Define and Develop Capabilities for Utilization of Private Sector Engineers&#13;
In previous years, engineering plans and specifications were the responsibility of national design institutes. As&#13;
a condition to receiving Bank funding, designs and specifications for the current water supply improvement project&#13;
were conducted by a foreign private sector consultant. Most efficient utilities make use of private sector consultants&#13;
for the design of the major new works, rather than maintain their own in-house design teams. Develop procedures&#13;
for the fair and efficient procurement of private sector consultants, and for monitoring their performance. Develop&#13;
the capabilities of the Authority technical staff in the use of such procedcures.&#13;
Task C        Strengthen the Authority's Capabilities in Finance and Revenues&#13;
Background Current capabilities in the Velayet in the areas of finance and revenue are very limited. Financially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 172                                      Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
self-sustaining sector organizations   require the capability of developing and using such systems as&#13;
payroll/personnel, general ledger and inventory control systems, and systems for revenue billing, collection and&#13;
cash flow monitoring.&#13;
Task C. 1     Define and Develop a Capacity for Budgeting&#13;
Based on the evaluation of existing conditions and assessment of future needs, recommend a new system of&#13;
budgeting for both capital and O&amp;M costs. The system should be suitable for a modern water and sanitation&#13;
utility, but also must be adaptable to the requirements of the Government's approved system of budgeting. Assist&#13;
the Authority in developing a basic capacity for this purpose which is appropriate for the initial needs of the&#13;
Authority.&#13;
Task C.2      Develop and Assist in Installing a System for Purchasing&#13;
Based on the evaluation of existing conditions and assessment of future needs, recommend a new system of&#13;
purchasing for the various types of equipment, commodities and services required by the Authority. The system&#13;
should be suitable for a modern water and sanitation utility. Depending upon the flexibility provided in the&#13;
Authority's charter, the system may have to meet the requirements of the Government's approved system of&#13;
purchasing. Assist the Authority in developing a basic capacity for this purpose which is appropriate for the initial&#13;
needs of the Authority.&#13;
Task C.3      Develop and Assist in Installing an Improved Accounting System&#13;
Based on the evaluation of existing conditions and assessment of future needs, recommend a new system of&#13;
accounting suitable for a modern water and sanitation utility. The system should include general ledger, payroll&#13;
and inventory control systems. Depending upon the flexibility provided in the Authority's charter, the system may&#13;
have to meet the requirements of the Government's approved system of accounting. In any event, the proposed&#13;
new accounting system must be adaptable to the requirements of the Government's approved system of accounting.&#13;
Assist the Authority in developing a basic capacity for this purpose which is appropriate for the initial needs of&#13;
the Authority.&#13;
Task C.4      Develop Systems for Billing and Collection of Revenues&#13;
At the present time there are no user charges for water, sanitation and wastewater services, so the only systems&#13;
for billing and collection relate to the small charges which are made for making connections to the system. Based&#13;
on the evaluation of existing systems and an assessment of future needs, as noted under Task B. 10 of Part II,&#13;
reconmmend a new system of billing and collection of revenues suitable for a modern water and sanitation utility.&#13;
Assist the Authority in developing a basic capacity for this purpose which is appropriate for the initial needs of&#13;
the Authority.&#13;
Task D        Strengthen the Authority's Capabilities in Personnel Management&#13;
Background Current levels of skills and payment schedules are inadequate to the Authority's needs. Control over&#13;
personnel, the capacity to train staff to meet the greater demands of an efficient sector organization, and the ability&#13;
to properly compensate trained staff will be dependent upon the ability of the Authority to become financially self-&#13;
sustaining. As long as the Authority is dependent upon the national government for funding it will be difficult&#13;
to achieve its objectives.&#13;
Task D. 1     Develop and Institutionalize a New Personnel System&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supplv and Sanitation Project                                   Page 173&#13;
Based on the evaluation of existing conditions and assessment of future needs, recommend a new personnel system&#13;
suitable for a modern water and sanitation utility. The system should include personnel policies, criteria for hiring&#13;
and firing, promoting and motivation, personnel performance reviews and record keeping, and training.&#13;
Depending upon the flexibility provided in the Authority's charter, the system may have to meet the requirements&#13;
of the Government's laws relative to personnel. Assist the Authority in developing a basic capacity for human&#13;
resource development and management which is appropriate for the initial needs of the Authority.&#13;
Task D.2     Identify Areas of Basic Skill Deficiencies and Suggest Programs for Overcoming Such Deficiencies&#13;
Based on the findings of existing conditions in the various departments following the completion of the sub-tasks&#13;
listed under Task A of Part II, identify the deficiencies in personnel capabilities which must be overcome in&#13;
strengthening the Authority as proposed under Part III. Recommend a program for overcoming deficiencies in&#13;
basic skills.&#13;
Task D.3     Identify Areas of Critical Skill Deficiencies and Develop Options for Obtaining Such Skills from&#13;
the Private Sector&#13;
Based on the results of Task D.2 above, determine which of these deficiencies occur among the "critical " skills&#13;
required by the Authority. Critical skills may be considered skills in the development, management and training&#13;
of others in the use of computers and software programs, development, management and monitoring of O&amp;M&#13;
programs; or other technical or management skills in short supply in Turkmenistan. Recommend a program for&#13;
overcoming deficiencies in critical skills, including consideration of contracting with the private sector for such&#13;
services until such time as these skills can be developed within the Authority.&#13;
Task E        Strengthen the Authority's Capabilities in Quality Control&#13;
Task E. I     Laboratories&#13;
Based on a review of pre-project evaluations of existing laboratories in the Velayet, and verification of the&#13;
adequacy of existing laboratories by means of selected field investigations, make recommendations for&#13;
consolidation and upgrading water quality laboratories in the Velayet. This evaluation is not meant to include&#13;
those laboratories operated by MOH/SES or other parties, but only those required to ensure that the Authority's&#13;
operations meets the legal requirements for providing potable water and for the adequacy of treatment of collected&#13;
wastewaters prior to disposal.&#13;
Task E.2      Define and Develop an Environmental Department&#13;
Prepare a description of duties and responsibilities for an environmental office within the quality control division&#13;
of the Authority. The environmental office should be independent of the engineering division, and should have&#13;
such responsibilities as conducting studies of the environmental consequences of current Authority activities,&#13;
reviewing plans for future activities for their environmental consequences, and advising the Managing Director&#13;
of any potentially adverse consequences of existing or planned activities, suggesting mitigation measures. Initially&#13;
this office probably should consist of a single professional person and a small administrative staff, with occasional&#13;
support from staff on loan from other departments as the workload requires.&#13;
Task E.3      Quality Control&#13;
Based on water quality standards for potable water and wastewater effluent quality standards, and on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

important aspects of the Authority's activities, including the delivery of potable water, satisfaction of wastewater&#13;
effluent standards, ensuring the reliability of water service, and meeting such other performance factors as may&#13;
be adopted by the Authority.&#13;
Task F        Develop Performance Indicators and Initiate Performance Monitoring&#13;
Task F. 1     Develop Key Performance Indicators for the Authority&#13;
Prepare a list of suggested key performance indicators for the Authority, similar to those suggested below, and&#13;
suggest target goals over time, as appropriate, in the following areas:&#13;
a.     Water Supply For each community water system: Number of hours per day that water is supplied under&#13;
pressure; Percent of water quality samples that meet bacteriological standards; Percent of community&#13;
population served; Total water produced; Number of leaks/breaks repaired per month; Percentage of&#13;
households with direct connections; Percentage of people within 50 meters of a functioning street faucet;&#13;
Number of street faucets and percentage of functioning street faucets; Hours per month that service is&#13;
unavailable to street faucets because of freezing; Average number of persons served per street faucet; and&#13;
similar indicators. Suggest a program to develop base-line data for the number of hours spent by&#13;
households in collecting water, and the amounts carried, for those dependent upon street faucets for their&#13;
water supply.&#13;
b.     Wastewater and Sanitation Performance indicators to be developed by the consultant, based on conditions&#13;
appropriate to the various communities.&#13;
c.     Finance and Administration  For each community water system, and for those two communities with&#13;
wastewater systems: Total operation and maintenance costs; O&amp;M costs per cubic meter of water&#13;
produced or wastewater collected; Revenues collected per month by type of customer (residential street&#13;
faucets, residential yard taps, commercial/industrial or other); Number of Authority employees per&#13;
customer served (all communities); Accounts receivable (revenues billed but not collected); Average age&#13;
of accounts receivable (how many months has it been, on average, since the accounts receivable were&#13;
billed); Information on the date of establishment, existence and effectiveness of such programs as training,&#13;
management information systems, financial systems, or other Authority functions; and other performance&#13;
indicators as appropriate.&#13;
Task F.2      Measurement of Performance&#13;
Suggest programs for the utilization of these performance indicators by management as a means of measuring&#13;
overall performance of the Authority, and for the publication and dissemination of reports on performance to the&#13;
Authority's Board of Directors, other supervisory organizations or groups which represent the interests of the&#13;
consumers.&#13;
Task G        Develop and Implement a Public Awareness Campaign&#13;
Background In addition to the institutional strengthening of the Authority as described in the previous tasks, the&#13;
consultant will develop and assist officials of the Velayet in the implementation of a public awareness campaign&#13;
(1) to inform the population in the project areas about improvements of services in water supply, sanitation and&#13;
health; (2) to introduce the principle of cost-recovery from those who benefit from the improved service; and (3)&#13;
to educate the general population about the value and importance of water conservation; safe practices for water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                                  Page 175&#13;
collection and storage; linkages between water, sanitation and good hygienic practices and health; and community&#13;
and household involvement in operation and maintenance of the water supply system. The public awareness&#13;
campaign is linked with the community development activities for community participation in water supply and&#13;
sanitation systems (which are being developed under the sanitation and health component of the project). Feedback&#13;
from numerous community focus groups and stakeholder workshops has found that beneficiairies want more public&#13;
education regarding the new systems so that they can identify specific and appropriate mechanisms for their&#13;
participation. The public awareness program will be implemented coincident with the establishment of the&#13;
Authority, and will be coordinated with the sanitation and health component of the project, and with the UNDP&#13;
national public awareness program on water conservation and usage.&#13;
Time Period and Responsibility for the Program The consultant will be responsible for this program for a period&#13;
of 18 months until the conclusion of the consultant's contract. At the completion of the consultant's contract, it&#13;
is intended that one or more of the local personnel trained by the consultant will be employed by the Authority&#13;
for assignment to the Customer Services Department described under Task A.7. The Authority will be encouraged&#13;
to continue the program at least until the end of construction, and preferably beyond that on a continuing but&#13;
reduced basis. The tasks to be performed are described as follows:&#13;
Task G. 1     Develop a Draft Public Awareness Program&#13;
Develop a draft public awareness program which includes (1) conducting initial surveys of public knowledge and&#13;
understanding of the issues mentioned in the campaign objectives (cost-recovery, water conservation, proprer water&#13;
usage, and community participation in the system operation and maintenance), (2) establishes measurable&#13;
objectives, (3) evaluates communication strategies, (4) determines target audiences, (5) recommends the media mix&#13;
to be utilized, (6) drafts the themes and contents of the messages to be imparted (including proper use of street&#13;
faucets and possibly neighborhood policing of such use), (7) determines the resources required, (8) prepares a&#13;
budget for the program to be implemented by the consultant, and (9) suggests annual budgets for a reduced&#13;

ANNEX S-3: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR&#13;
SANITATION AND HEALTH COMPONENT&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I.    The Government of Turkmenistan has received a loan from  the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) in support of a program of investments to improve and&#13;
expand water supply, sanitation and health in the regions affected by the Aral Sea disaster. The&#13;
objectives of the proposed project would be to: (i) improve water supply and sanitation in etrap centers&#13;
and selected collective farms in Dashkhovuz velayet; and (ii) initiate institutional changes in the water&#13;
and sanitation sectors to ensure that the project is financially and technically sustainable. Within the&#13;
scope of this project, the Government has decided to contract the services of consultants (the Consultant)&#13;
to carry out the Sanitation and Health Component.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.     Health status.  Health status in Turkmenistan is poor, compared with other countries of the&#13;
former Soviet Union, and health status is poorer in Dashkhovuz velayet than in the rest of the country.&#13;
The poor and declining health is attributed to degradation of the environment; qualitative and&#13;
quantitative deterioration of the drinking water supply; poor sanitation and hygiene practices; protein and&#13;
vitamin deficiency; and inadequate and declining health care services.&#13;
3.     Responsibilities for water provision and quality, sanitation and hygiene. In urban areas of&#13;
Dashkhovuz Velayet, the Department of Housing and Communal Services (DHCS) have responsibility&#13;
for operating and maintaining the Dashkhovuz City piped wastewater system, through the Dashkhovuz&#13;
Vodocanal. They also are said to have responsibility for the provision and maintenance of latrines in&#13;
public areas such as government buildings, markets and clinics or hospitals. Installation of latrines in&#13;
schools appears to be under the control of individual school authorities. No official government&#13;
organization has responsibility for any aspect of latrines or other means of excreta disposal for private&#13;
households or businesses. While the Sanitary and Epidemiological Services of the Ministry of Health&#13;
(MOHMI/SES) is primarily a regulatory agency to monitor the performance and quality of the water and&#13;
wastewater services being provided, they also appear to be involved in the "treatment" (addition of lime)&#13;
and disposal of latrine sludges from some institutional latrines, such as those in schools. Whether or not&#13;
DHCS, MOHMI/SES or any other governmental organization has responsibility for them, most&#13;
institutional latrines are in deplorable condition.&#13;
4.     The MOHMI/SES has the clear responsibility for monitoring the quality of the water supplied to&#13;
the people of Turkmenistan through municipal water supply systems. No agency concerns itself with the&#13;
quality of water used by people from their private sources of water. SES samples water quality from&#13;
public systems at the point of supply, the distribution system, and selected users, including schools and&#13;
homes. The frequency and number of tests depends upon the size of the system being monitored.&#13;
Sampling is said to take place about once or twice a month, on average. As noted hereinafter, water&#13;
quality frequently fails to meet drinking water standards. SES has the authority to levy fines against&#13;
communities which fail to chlorinate, and to shut down systems which fail bacteriological tests.&#13;
Officials whose systems frequently fail to meet the standards are subject to criminal prosecution. It&#13;
appears that these sanctions are rarely imposed. As a result of severe budget limitations, SES suffers&#13;
from a shortage of operable vehicles, buildings of limited size and poor quality, and laboratories with&#13;
failing equipment and inadequate supplies of chemicals. These problems constrain SES in fulfilling its&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 178                        Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Proiect&#13;
5.     The project.  On the Aral Sea Basin regional level, the project originates from the Aral Sea&#13;
Program 5 "Clean Water and Health" and constitutes Project 5.2 Turkmenistan Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation. The project was specifically intended to address the demand for improved water supplies for&#13;
the population most affected by the Aral Sea disaster. It is also based on optimizing the health benefits&#13;
realized by improvements in water supply systems by improving sanitation and hygiene. The project&#13;
would be the first infrastructure investment operation in Turkmenistan, therefore the project was&#13;
designed to be focused and simple to inplement both technically and administratively. During project&#13;
preparation it was determined that a long-term investment in excess of US$ 140 million would be&#13;
required to rehabilitate and expand the water supply infrastructure to the entire velayet. Therefore it was&#13;
decided that the project would focus on the immediate needs (which are in the secondary cities and farms&#13;
rather than the capital city) in an equitable fashion by improving services in one secondary city and one&#13;
farm in each etrap. Noting significant sector institutional weaknesses on the national and regional level,&#13;
the project was designed to include institutional restructuring and financial reforms on the regional level.&#13;
The project would serve as a demonstration for institutional reforms.&#13;
6.     The Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Resource Management has undertaken project&#13;
preparation with technical assistance from Electrowatt Engineering. The feasibility work included two&#13;
demonstration projects: the installation of effective taps on street standpipes in Gubadagh; and the&#13;
construction of improved latrines and handwashing facilities at a school in Boldumsaz. Results of the&#13;
street standpipe demonstration have been taken into account in the water supply rehabilitation&#13;
component and form the basis for the development of community involvement in operation and&#13;
maintenance. The results of the sanitation project forn the basis of the school-based sanitation, hygiene&#13;
and health education component of the project. The results of these two demonstration projects were&#13;
used in the project formulation. During preparation, participatory methods, such as focus group&#13;
discussions, were used routinely to guide the two demonstration projects and to provide additional&#13;
background information. A local NGO has been actively engaged in project preparation and is assisting&#13;
in the implementation of the community involvement components of the two demonstration projects.&#13;
During appraisal, the role of the community in the project was discussed in a stakeholder workshop&#13;
conducted in Dashkhovuz, and in subsequent discussions with local community residents; water, health&#13;
and education authorities; non-governmental organizations (NGOs); donors; and government officials.&#13;
Based on these discussions, the principle of increased community participation to strengthen the&#13;
involvement of beneficiaries in system design, usage and operation and maintenance has been agreed&#13;
upon and emphasized in the project.&#13;
Objectives and approach&#13;
7.     The Consultant will provide technical assistance to the Government of Turkmenistan and local&#13;
authorities in Dashkhovuz to implement the Sanitation and Health Component of the Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation Project. The component aims at improving sanitation, health and hygiene through the&#13;
installation of improved public toilets, especially in schools and markets, as well as through health&#13;
promotion and hygiene education. The component combines activities aiming at changing the population&#13;
and authorities knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to health, water supply, sanitation and&#13;
hygiene; with improvements in the water supply and sanitation facilities, namely by improving access to&#13;
safe water, and to handwashing and sanitation facilities in target sites such as schools and markets. The&#13;
objectives and subcomponents of the Sanitation and Health component are the following:&#13;
8.     Sanitation and Health. The objective of this component is to optimize the project's health&#13;
benefits through improved sanitation, health promotion, hygiene education, the improvement of water&#13;
quality monitoring and sanitation, and better hygiene surveillance. Almost all households in urban and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Turkmenistan: Water Supply and Sanitation Project                        Page 179&#13;
rural areas have a sanitation facility (pit latrine), but coverage is less complete in schools, markets, and&#13;
other communal facilities. Most sanitation facilities are in very poor condition and few have&#13;
handwashing facilities. This project component will target the under-served and receptive beneficiaries&#13;
by improving sanitation and hygiene schools and markets. It will rehabilitate and construct latrines and&#13;
install handwashing basins in target schools and markets in the areas covered by the project. The three&#13;
subcomponents include:&#13;
9.    Improvement of Sanitation, Hygiene and Water Supply Facilities Utilizing Community-&#13;
Based Approaches. The objective of this subcomponent is to demonstrate the benefits of safe water&#13;
usage and conservation, and of improved sanitation and hygiene through community-based activities.&#13;
Results of the school sanitation and health education demonstration project conducted as part of project&#13;
preparation have been used to design this sub-component. The subcomponent will provide local and&#13;
foreign technical assistance in community participation to develop community-based activities to&#13;
improve water supply and sanitation. The Consultant will assist the Department of Housing and&#13;
Communal Services (DHCS) to implement this subcomponent in Dashkhovuz velayet. This&#13;
subcomponent will finance the rehabilitation of latrines and installation of hand-washing basins in about&#13;
45 schools in the nine collective farms for which water supply improvements are being provided, and in&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Water Supply and Sanitation Project
            aims to: (1) improve infrastructure in administrative zones
            (etrap centers) and collective farms in the Dashkhovuz
            administrative region (velayet); and (2) initiate
            institutional changes to make the project financially and
            technically sustainable. The project comprises four main
            components: (a) water supply improvements -to rehabilitate

            repairing and replacing street standpipes and providing new
            taps; rehabilitating transmission mains, well fields,
            distribution centers, and installing new electrical systems,
            mechanical plant, and appropriate chlorinating equipment to
            reduce water loss and operation and maintenance costs,
            improve water quality, and extend water supply time; (b)
            sanitation and health -to improve sanitation facilities and
            health practices by rehabilitating latrines and installing
            handwashing basins in schools and markets using
            community-based approaches; finance buying vehicles and
            equipment; promote health and hygiene education; improve
            water quality monitoring and sanitation and hygiene
            surveillance systems; upgrade laboratories; and improve data
            collection, analysis and reporting; (c) institutional
            strengthening -to improve service delivery with technical
            assistance, building capacity of a specialized regional
