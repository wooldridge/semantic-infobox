The inclusion of a gender component in initiatives that seek to     In the water and sanitation sector in Latin America and the&#13;

comes to develop specific tools, which should help integrate        and Sanitation Program (WSP) has promoted the inclusion of&#13;
the concept of gender in daily work. This document attempts         gender equity in the projects implemented in the Region,&#13;
to contribute to the debate on how to promote equal relations       carrying out diagnosis and validating methodologies at three&#13;
between men and women in terms of access to, control                levels: political, institutional and community.&#13;
and benefits of water and sanitation services, on the basis&#13;
of a concrete experience.                                           This document is based on the experience of the Small&#13;

 1. Starting points&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.1 Gender and citizenship                                                   territory, as well as the fact that citizenship is not acquired&#13;
                                                                             at the same time by all1:&#13;
Citizenship is a concept that refers to the relationship between          · The concept of citizenship is linked to participation in the&#13;
citizens and between citizens and the state. These relations have            public sphere and therefore to the social construction of&#13;
been historically established and are constantly evolving in daily life      the masculine space. While the private domain, which is&#13;
and in diverse political and social contexts. Therefore the focus of         basically constructed as a feminine space, does not seem&#13;
the agenda of the discussion on citizenship must also include an             to be linked to citizenship.&#13;
emphasis on social rights and the social politics of each country.&#13;
                                                                          · Women, who are looked upon solely as wives and mothers,&#13;
&#13;
In the British tradition, led by Marshall (1992), citizenship is defined     are frequently being represented but do not represent.&#13;
&#13;
as the status granted to all actual members of a community, who              In many cases, they remain dependent on their husbands,&#13;
&#13;
are equal with respect to their rights and obligations. There are            like their children.&#13;
&#13;
three aspects to this concept: 1) civil citizenship, linked to the&#13;
need for expression and thought; 2) political citizenship, linked to      In the specific case of the relation between citizenship and&#13;
&#13;
the exercising of political power by vote or the right to be elected      access to water and sanitation services, a gender focus allows&#13;
&#13;
and 3) social citizenship linked to the right to welfare and economic     visibilisation of a situation that this debate talks about. The strong&#13;
&#13;
and social security.                                                      relationship that exists between women and water is restricted to&#13;
                                                                          the private family sphere and the inadequate presence of women&#13;
&#13;
This classical approach to the concept of citizenship did not             in decision-making processes for management of the water&#13;
&#13;
include a gender dimension; a fact that highlights the                    resource has been documented in various studies carried out&#13;
&#13;
differentiated processes of access to and the exercise of civil,          (García: 2000). As a step towards improving this deficient&#13;
&#13;
political and social rights for men and women. The inclusion of           situation, some basic guidelines have been defined to bring about&#13;
&#13;
a gender perspective in the debate compels the adoption of a              a change in the relationship between women and the management&#13;
&#13;
different approach to this concept. Batthyany Karina (2004)               of the water resource. Besides promoting human development&#13;
&#13;
reviews these dimensions, which are summarized below:                     and equal opportunities, the inclusive focus also proposes that&#13;
                                                                          access to, control and the benefits of resources must be equitable&#13;
· The most radical critiques place the notion of universal                for both men and women. Access is defined as the capacity to&#13;
  citizenship at the center of the discussion, proposing an               have material, economic, political, informative, educative and&#13;
  ideal definition of citizenship that is based on differences,           time-related resources at one's disposal; Control is the capacity&#13;
  distinguishing between men and women as individuals and                 to decide on the utilization of these resources and benefits are&#13;
  therefore acknowledging gender differences in the access to             defined as the earnings from these resources or the effect that&#13;
  and the exercise of rights.                                             they have on the living conditions of men and women (Niño de&#13;
· The inequalities between men and women in terms of power in             Guzmán and Zevallos: 2002).&#13;
  the political space are a result of the inequities that exist within&#13;
  families and in the professional space.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                            1&#13;
· It is necessary to acknowledge the existence of differentiated             For example political citizenship in Peru was first granted to men, before&#13;
                                                                             women acquired it; and the literate were granted citizenship first before&#13;
  access to civil, political and social rights for people from a certain     the illiterate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A scenario in which the people are excluded from access to&#13;
information, to mechanisms of participation in decision-making&#13;
processes, as well as access to the services and it's benefits,&#13;
for example in the case of good quality water and sanitation&#13;
services, implies a situation where the minimum, essential&#13;
conditions for the exercise of full citizenship are not being met.&#13;
The exercise of citizen's rights and duties in terms of access&#13;
to basic services, such as water and sanitation, is achieved by&#13;
establishing mechanisms for equitable access, decision&#13;
making and utilization of resources for men and women, thus&#13;
contributing towards good governance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This process requires ensuring equitable access to basic&#13;
information on water and sanitation services and also on future&#13;
development projects. It also requires the creation and/or widening&#13;
of the scope of mechanisms for participation in decision-making&#13;
processes and including both men and women, seeking quality            the projects2. A study carried out by WSP/IRC in 15 countries,&#13;
                                                                                                                            3&#13;
&#13;
water services, in the management of these services. Only in this      in 2001, showed that specific strategies to work with gender&#13;
way will the precedent be set for good exercise of citizenship,        and poverty showed differences in terms of the sustainability&#13;
through which not only will they evaluate and pay for the services,    of services and investments. In a comparative analysis of 88&#13;
but will also actively participate in the management of these          communities participating in the water and sanitation projects, it&#13;

contribute to the town's development.                                  effective services had incorporated gender focus and poverty-&#13;
                                                                       sensitivity criteria in community participation. In comparison, only&#13;
If the water and sanitation projects are linked to improved            30% of the communities that did not show sustainability had&#13;
access to citizenship and improved living conditions, changes          incorporated the above mentioned elements.&#13;
resulting from these processes can be effectively monitored.&#13;
In this regard, various institutions have sought to document the       On the other hand, people's understanding of the relationship&#13;
benefits obtained by incorporating a gender focus in interventions     between improved health and quality water and sanitation&#13;
related to supply and management of water and sanitation               services had a positive effect on its valuation and on health&#13;

                                                                        to strengthen capacities to manage local development in an&#13;
&#13;
Promoting responsible citizenship of women and men in the               efficient manner.&#13;
&#13;
management of water and sanitation services has been one&#13;
of the challenges before the Small Town Pilot Project (STPP).           The Small Town Pilot Project in Peru was launched with the&#13;
                                                                        objective of improving water and sanitation management services&#13;
&#13;
Part of the decentralization process that the country is going          in towns with less than 30,000 inhabitants. The project proposed&#13;
&#13;
through at present; this project is linked with the building of         a change in the model for management of services, moving from&#13;
&#13;
good governance. One of the challenges has been to ensure               a municipal operator to a specialized operator. This model seeks&#13;
&#13;
participative management of development, by employing various           to forge an alliance between three actors: the municipality, a&#13;
&#13;
mechanisms: Concertation Committees, Regional and Local                 specialized operator and a neighborhood council, where each&#13;
&#13;
Consultation Committees, Neighborhood Councils, among                   actor plays a certain role for the efficient management of the&#13;
&#13;
others. But to improve this, it is indispensable to first "resolve      service. The operator offers quality service, the municipality&#13;
&#13;
secular problems", that is to say, "resolve inequalities and            oversees the completion of the management contract and invests&#13;
&#13;
inequities" (SDC: 2003). For example, regarding the issue at            in infrastructure and the neighborhood council supervises the&#13;
&#13;
hand, it means resolving differences in access to water and             quality of the service provided by the operator.&#13;
&#13;
sanitation services offered in small towns or resolving difficult&#13;
access to basic services. It is an issue of shortage compounded         The promotion of new management models implies that the&#13;
&#13;
by gender inequity, which prevent and restrict the building of a        municipality, private sector and the people establish new rules&#13;
&#13;
democratic culture.                                                     of play. Understanding and openness are expected of the local&#13;
                                                                        municipality in order to establish relations built on dialogue,&#13;
&#13;
Decentralizing decision-making powers and financial resources           discussion and consensus between the state, the private sector&#13;
&#13;
has for long been a demand made by local governments to the             and citizenship. Citizens must change their perception of the role&#13;
&#13;
central government. Although the recent political process of            of the local government as a supplier of services and accept it&#13;
&#13;
decentralization and regionalization was initiated in 2003, water       as an administrator and supervisor of agreements and contracts;&#13;

&#13;
services are deficient, characterized by low quality, poor coverage,    women and men will have the opportunity to ensure 1) access&#13;
&#13;
subsidies, deteriorating infrastructure, lack of updated and reliable   to quality services in terms of water and sanitation and 2) the&#13;
&#13;
information9, a fact that has led to dissatisfaction among the          right to participate in decision-making on services, as part of the&#13;

people. This is a situation that clearly demonstrates the urgent        citizenship exercise.&#13;

The project was developed in the three regions of the country,                            3. In effective terms, did the project improve relations between the&#13;
the coastal area, mountain region and amazon jungle and in                                   state and the people, in aspects relating to water and sanitation&#13;
diverse political, social and economic contexts. An important effort                         by promoting the exercise of good governance?&#13;
was made by the project implementation team to use media to&#13;
stimulate active participation and equitable distribution of work                         To respond to these questions, a qualitative and quantitative&#13;
between men and women, both in the institutional space as well as                         study was carried out, attempting to document the experience.&#13;
in the community space, keeping in mind the proposed objectives.                          For this study primary and secondary sources were used .      10&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Access to remunerated employment and education is intimately&#13;
linked to higher education, better employment and vice versa. In all&#13;
the districts of the STPP, women tended to have lesser educational&#13;
qualifications and therefore lesser access to the professional&#13;
market, as in the case of Sechura in which approximately eight&#13;
in every ten persons without access to remunerated employment&#13;
are women11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In this context, women take care of the household and the&#13;
children, and are thus directly concerned with any issues in the&#13;
drinking water service, which affects their daily chores; cooking,&#13;
washing the clothes, cleaning the house, children's hygiene, etc.     Source: Results of the 10th National Population Census and Fifth Housing Census 2005.&#13;
Even in the case of women who work outside home, it is likely&#13;
that they are the ones responsible for the domestic chores.           The conditions described above contribute to the fact that both&#13;
                                                                      men and women recognize that it is they who best understand&#13;
In the towns participating in the project, access to water in the     the situation in terms of the service and who also suffer the&#13;
home was very limited, especially in the mountain and forest          consequences of any deficiencies. Women, in particular recognize&#13;
regions, as Graphic 1 shows. This situation increases the burden      the importance of their presence in discussions and decision-&#13;
on women and has repercussions on their utilization of time and       making on the services, as the following testimonies show:&#13;
theirs as well as their children's health.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
However, in spite of the close relationship that many of them&#13;
have with water services and the acknowledgement that they&#13;
are knowledgeable about it, women had not been participating&#13;
actively in this sphere, in terms of decision-making on the services&#13;
in their localities. In Tumán, a town located in the north of Peru,&#13;
for example, when the STPP project was started, it was found&#13;
that more than 80% of the women had never participated in the&#13;
decisions made for implementation of water and sanitation works.&#13;
The main obstacles that came in the way of their participation were&#13;
explained as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Overload of work at home&#13;
· Lack of training and&#13;
· Active exclusion demonstrated by the non-involvement of                of their scarce resources, provides an opportunity for women&#13;
  women in decision-making.                                              to become partners in changing traditional conditions of&#13;

This situation reveals the fact that the social confinement of           and collaboration between men and women. The result of&#13;
women to the private family space appears to be an attempt to            strengthening the management of these services with their&#13;

by statements such as women are less educated, less informed&#13;
and therefore less capable of making decisions.                          1. are well aware of the drinking water and sanitation situation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
However, the affirmation of their potential as housewives, who           2. recognize the improvement of services as a benefit, and&#13;
&#13;
are knowledgeable and have experience in the management                  3. value the water resource.&#13;

consultations take place, where it is important to make a decision          The JVCSS is constituted by an assembly of male and female&#13;
that would benefit the entire family. Thus if the acceptance of an          delegates, who are representatives of the localities or sectors of&#13;
increase in the tariff is backed by women, so that the service              the town. The assembly in turn elects a directive board, which is&#13;
may improve, men in turn bring to the discussion the limitations in&#13;
their income, so that a fair tariff is then arrived at, which can&#13;
be included in the household budget of the majority.&#13;
&#13;
    "Men asked about the cost, if it was going to vary, if this was&#13;
    really going to be privatized, this was their main concern"&#13;
    (JVCSS woman, Tabalosos)&#13;
&#13;
    "The proposal more or less was that you were going to have&#13;
    water in your house and people said yes we are ready and the&#13;
    mothers were saying that they were even willing to pay one sol&#13;
    a day but a man who sees the financial part of it sees that one&#13;
    sol a day means 30 soles a month" (JVCSS man, Sechura)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Thus in this way a Social Agreement was arrived at in terms of&#13;
the tariff and quality of service that would benefit the families and&#13;
which both men and women have undertaken to respect,&#13;
&#13;

In order to guarantee equitable participation of both men and                                         of JVCSS delegates&#13;

                                      and 50% women was established,&#13;
  "Each locality will elect           thus ensuring that there was&#13;

                                      to the JVCSS.&#13;
&#13;
In practice not all localities managed to fill the established quota,                       Graphic 7: Distribution of the members&#13;
however all of them had a significant participation of men and                                   of the JVCSS Directive Board&#13;
women, both in the Assembly of Delegates as well as in the&#13;
Directive Board.&#13;

                                                                                Once the Neighborhood Board (JVCSS) was formed this was&#13;

                                                                                  accordance with the contractual obligations assumed by the&#13;
                                                                                  specialized operator.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
· Promote fulfillment of the obligations of the users of services,        Graphic 8: Distribution of attendance of men&#13;
  such as: the duty to use water and sewage services correctly            and women in the JVCSS training workshops&#13;
&#13;
  and the duty to pay for the services.&#13;
&#13;
· Ensure compliance with the principles that govern public&#13;
  services: equality, continuity, compulsoriness, continuity and&#13;
  regularity.&#13;
&#13;
To carry out these functions the members of the JVCSS must&#13;
strengthen their capacities to participate in these decision-making&#13;
spaces. Training workshops for men and women have been the&#13;
mechanism used. These workshops have dealt with the roles&#13;
and functions of the JVCSS, the quality of water and sanitation&#13;
services, the duties and rights of the users of services. Both men&#13;
and women have thus started their functions as supervisors of&#13;
the services, defenders of rights and educators in terms of good&#13;
utilization of resources and full exercise of citizenship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4. Building citizenship: local government,&#13;
        male and female citizens&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
All the mechanisms of participation, consultation and                 The changes perceived by the participants of the qualitative study&#13;
management, which were implemented brought about a                    can be summarized in two points:&#13;
change in the relationship of the municipality with citizens,&#13;
                                                                      · The introduction of mechanisms for information and citizen&#13;
and led to the creation of mechanisms for citizen participation&#13;
                                                                        participation ­namely the Promotion and Communication&#13;
that brought the authorities closer to the community. Qualitative&#13;
                                                                        Committee, Citizen Consultation and the Board for Water&#13;
information shows that people felt included in the process thanks&#13;
                                                                        and Sanitation Service Supervision.&#13;
to greater information and the creation of spaces for consultation&#13;
and communication, which led them to assume responsibility            · The perception of citizens with regard to their relationship with&#13;
&#13;
within the project, such as the commitment to pay for the               the local government, which was transformed from the role of&#13;
&#13;
services, which the municipal management had not managed                a beneficiary to the role of citizens with rights and duties, that&#13;
&#13;
to achieve in many towns.                                               is to say jointly responsible for local development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Graphic 9: Changes during the STPP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In response to the third question that was posed, the project&#13;
effectively improved relations between the state and civil society,&#13;
contributing to the creation of a new concept and image of a&#13;
citizen, with the right to be informed and involved in development&#13;
processes and at the same time aware of having duties and&#13;
responsibilities that must be fulfilled. The people thus stop being&#13;
"beneficiaries" of the work of the authorities, and become "citizens"&#13;
that is to say active agents in community and personal change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The changes, in order to be lasting must occur not only at the&#13;
structural level but must also be a conscious process of change at&#13;
the personal level. In the analysis of benefits besides the access to&#13;
the resource, we found that men and women valued the learning&#13;
process and the opportunity to serve the community. Women also&#13;
valued access to information, spaces where they could express&#13;
their opinion and the opportunity for free expression of ideas in an&#13;
environment characterized by horizontal and democratic relations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. Lessons Learned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· The incorporation of a gender component strengthens                   · Women and men decide together on the tariffs,&#13;
  the expression of the citizen's demand for access to                    contributing their different perspectives. The main&#13;
  quality services and the willingness to pay a fair tariff.              concern of women with regard to the services tends to be&#13;
  Mainstreaming a gender approach in the STPP has been efficient          regarding an improvement in the quality of these services and&#13;
  because it has promoted and facilitated the processes of social         they are willing to pay a fair price for a quality service. Men,&#13;
  change, which resulted in the identification and strengthening of       on the contrary, tend to prioritize the increase in tariff as a&#13;
  a more qualified and sustained demand by citizens for access to         concern, without establishing the relationship between cost&#13;
  quality services and also responsibility on their part in terms of      and quality of service. However, based on these two&#13;
  the payment of a fair tariff.                                           perspectives, a process of negotiation is undertaken which&#13;
                                                                          highlights the quality-cost relation and subsequently results&#13;
· A participative methodological proposal like the one                    in the setting of a fair price.&#13;
  adopted in the project establishes a strong link with&#13;
  aspects that are highly valued by men and women.                      · Women and men who are trained on the water and&#13;
  Valuing of collective effort and cooperation. Both must be              sanitation issue also created local capacity for&#13;
  stressed on in the manner in which water and sanitation                 management of resources. The continued training of men&#13;
  services are organized in small towns.                                  and women during the course of the project, favored the&#13;
                                                                          creation of new capacities that are required in the management&#13;
· The relationship that women have with water is an                       of the service, thus incorporating the experience gained from&#13;
  opportunity to promote their recognition in the public                  citizen surveillance and supervision.&#13;
  space. The intense relationship between women and water,&#13;
  for domestic use, favors the social recognition of a whole set        · The inclusive mechanisms for men and women in&#13;
  of experiences and know how, as well as the capacity for                development contribute to the exercise of good&#13;
  contribution and the right to participate in the public space for       governance. Access to greater information for both genders&#13;
  management of this resource. The diverse mechanisms used                results in better informed citizens and widens access to&#13;
  during the development of the project, which have led to the            decision-making mechanisms and the capacity for management&#13;
  visibilization of aspects ranging from the right to information         of water and sanitation services, mechanisms that are part of&#13;
  to the right to participation in public spaces for management           development management. These capacities that are acquired&#13;
  of this resource, have helped in recognizing the woman-water            result in deeper links between the local government and men&#13;
  relationship and taking it out of the domestic space has allowed        and women who are exercising their citizenship, bringing them&#13;
  it to be legitimately represented in the political decision making      closer, in this manner to good governance.&#13;
  space, that is to say in the public domain.&#13;
