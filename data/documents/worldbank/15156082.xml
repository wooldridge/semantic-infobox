&#13;
The lives of girls and women have changed dramatically over the past quarter century. Today,&#13;
more girls and women are literate than ever before, and in a third of developing countries,&#13;
there are more girls in school than boys. Women now make up over 40 percent of the global&#13;
labor force. Moreover, women live longer than men in all regions of the world. The pace of&#13;
change has been astonishingâ&#128;&#148;indeed, in many developing countries, they have been faster&#13;
than the equivalent changes in developed countries: What took the United States 40 years to&#13;
achieve in increasing girlsâ&#128;&#153; school enrollment has taken Morocco just a decade.&#13;
    In some areas, however, progress toward gender equality has been limitedâ&#128;&#148;even in devel-&#13;
oped countries. Girls and women who are poor, live in remote areas, are disabled, or belong&#13;
to minority groups continue to lag behind. Too many girls and women are still dying in child-&#13;
hood and in the reproductive ages. Women still fall behind in earnings and productivity, and&#13;
in the strength of their voices in society. In some areas, such as education, there is now a gen-&#13;
der gap to the disadvantage of men and boys.&#13;
    The main message of this yearâ&#128;&#153;s World Development Report: Gender Equality and Develop-&#13;
ment is that these patterns of progress and persistence in gender equality matter, both for&#13;
development outcomes and policy making. They matter because gender equality is a core&#13;
development objective in its own right. But greater gender equality is also smart economics,&#13;
enhancing productivity and improving other development outcomes, including prospects for&#13;
the next generation and for the quality of societal policies and institutions. Economic develop-&#13;
ment is not enough to shrink all gender disparitiesâ&#128;&#148;corrective policies that focus on persist-&#13;
ing gender gaps are essential.&#13;
    This Report points to four priority areas for policy going forward. First, reducing gender&#13;
gaps in human capitalâ&#128;&#148;speciï¬?cally those that address female mortality and education. Sec-&#13;
ond, closing gender gaps in access to economic opportunities, earnings, and productivity.&#13;
Third, shrinking gender differences in voice and agency within society. Fourth, limiting the&#13;
reproduction of gender inequality across generations. These are all areas where higher incomes&#13;
by themselves do little to reduce gender gaps, but focused policies can have a real impact.&#13;
    Public actions need to address the underlying determinants of gender gaps in each pri-&#13;
ority areaâ&#128;&#148;in some cases, improving service delivery (especially for clean water, sanitation,&#13;
and maternal care), for others, tackling constraints that originate in the workings of mar-&#13;
kets and institutions to limit progress (for example, in reducing gender gaps in earnings and&#13;
productivity).&#13;
    Development partners can complement public action. In each of the four priority areas,&#13;
efforts need more funding (particularly to support the poorest countries as they address&#13;
female mortality and gender gaps in education); better gender-disaggregated data; more&#13;
experimentation and systematic evaluation; and broader partnerships that include the private&#13;
sector, development agencies, and civil society organizations.&#13;

          Gender equality is at the heart of development. Itâ&#128;&#153;s the right development objective, and&#13;
      itâ&#128;&#153;s smart economic policy. The World Development Report 2012 can help both countries and&#13;
      international partners think through and integrate a focus on gender equality into develop-&#13;
      ment policy making and programming.&#13;

DATA NOTES&#13;
The countries included in regional and income groupings in this Report are listed in the&#13;
Classiï¬?cation of Economies table at the end of the Selected World Development Indicators.&#13;
Income classiï¬?cations are based on GNP per capita; thresholds for income classiï¬?cations in&#13;
this edition may be found in the Introduction to Selected World Development Indicators.&#13;
Group averages reported in the ï¬?gures and tables are unweighted averages of the countries in&#13;
the group, unless noted to the contrary.&#13;
   The use of the word countries to refer to economies implies no judgment by the World&#13;
Bank about the legal or other status of a territory. The term developing countries includes low-&#13;
and middle-income economies and thus may include economies in transition from central&#13;
planning, as a matter of convenience. The term advanced countries may be used as a matter of&#13;
convenience to denote high-income economies.&#13;
&#13;
Note: Dollar ï¬?gures are current U.S. dollars, unless otherwise speciï¬?ed. Billion means 1,000&#13;
million; trillion means 1,000 billion.&#13;

   Baruani is reï¬&#130;ecting on how womenâ&#128;&#153;s and menâ&#128;&#153;s lives have changed over the past decade in&#13;
   Ijuhanyondoâ&#128;&#148;a village in Tanzania. â&#128;&#156;Ten years back was terrible,â&#128;? she recalls. â&#128;&#156;Women were very be-&#13;
   hind. They used to be only at home doing housework. But now, they are in businesses, they are in poli-&#13;
   tics.â&#128;? Others hold similar views. â&#128;&#156;We do not depend a lot on men as it used to be,â&#128;? says Agnetha. â&#128;&#156;We&#13;
   have some cash for ourselves, and this assists us in being free from men and to some extent controlling&#13;
   our lives.â&#128;? In addition to managing their businesses, the women now make up half the members of the&#13;
   street committee that runs the village.&#13;
&#13;
   Despite these positive changes, many challenges continue to weigh on womenâ&#128;&#153;s daily lives. Fewer than&#13;
   half the homes in the village have piped water. Even more difï¬?cult, Tungise and other women of the&#13;
   village still fear violence by their partners: â&#128;&#156;When they are drunk, they can begin beating up women and&#13;
   children in the house. The worst bit of it is forcing sex with you.â&#128;? Although legally women can inherit&#13;
   land or a house, tradition prevails. â&#128;&#156;Yes, women can inherit property,â&#128;? says Flora, the executive secretary&#13;
   of the street committee. â&#128;&#156;In fact, in the will the father is supposed to give each son and daughter some-&#13;
   thing, and nowadays the law is strict, equally. But still, men give to their sons and argue that women&#13;

      BOX 1     What do we mean by gender equality?&#13;
&#13;
      Gender refers to the social, behavioral, and cultural attributes,                 that arise from circumstances beyond the control of individuals and&#13;
      expectations, and norms associated with being a woman or a man.                   those that stem from differences in preferences and choices. A sub-&#13;
      Gender equality refers to how these aspects determine how women                   stantial body of research documents such male-female differences in&#13;

      power between them.                                                               follows that if men and women differ, on average, in attitudes, prefer-&#13;
          This Report focuses on three key dimensions of gender equality                ences, and choices, then not all observed differences in outcomes&#13;
      identified by men and women from Afghanistan to Poland to South                   can be attributed to differences in opportunities.&#13;
      Africa, as well as by researchers: the accumulation of endowments                     Those who argue for equality of outcomes argue that differ-&#13;

      and the application of those endowments to take actions, or agency,               that lead men and women to internalize social norms and expec-&#13;

      ences are of particular relevance to the analysis of gender equality.             opportunity.&#13;
      First, the welfare of women and men living in the same household                      Despite this debate, it is difficult in practice to measure oppor-&#13;
      is difficult to measure separately, a problem that is compounded by               tunities separately from outcomes. Indeed, equality of opportuni-&#13;

      ences, needs, and constraints can differ systematically between                   in measurement. For this reason, the Report takes a pragmatic&#13;
      men and women, reflecting both biological factors and â&#128;&#156;learnedâ&#128;?                   approach, focusing on both outcomes and opportunities in relation&#13;
      social behaviors. Third, gender cuts across distinctions of income                to endowments, agency, and access to economic activities. Follow-&#13;
      and class. These characteristics raise the question whether gender                ing Sen, we also believe that while people may disagree in what is&#13;
      equality should be measured as equality of outcomes or equality of                just or fair, they will agree on eliminating what are â&#128;&#156;outrageously&#13;

          Those who defend framing gender equality as equality of oppor-                ties, most will agree that gross manifestations of gender inequality&#13;

Note: The measure of inequality refers to the percentage of total opportunities that must be reallocated to ensure that all the circumstances groups have the same average cover-&#13;
age rate. Low inequality is between 1.0 percent and 3.2 percent, moderate inequality is between 3.4 percent and 5.2 percent, and high inequality is between 5.2 percent and&#13;
22.0 percent. Results are sorted by size of gender contribution to total inequality.&#13;

Note: The measure of inequality refers to the percentage of total opportunities that must be reallocated to ensure that all possible combinations of circumstances have the same&#13;
average enrollment. Low inequality is between 0.3 percent and 2.1 percent, moderate inequality is between 2.3 percent and 6.4 percent, and high inequality is between 6.5 per-&#13;
cent and 26.7 percent. Results are sorted by size of gender contribution to total inequality.&#13;

      BOX 4.7     Why do social norms persist?&#13;
&#13;
      Cultural beliefs shape views. Evidence from psychology and other                    was abandoned only when community members collectively&#13;
      social sciences shows that the beliefs of individuals shape what they               decided to end it, by pledging not to bind their daughters or not to&#13;
      pay attention to and how they interpret it. People have a cognitive                 let their sons marry bound women. When practices are nearly uni-&#13;
      bias that leads them to misinterpret new information in ways that                   versal, individuals might simply be unable to imagine alternative&#13;

      Indeed, if two groups have different initial beliefs, the same new                  morality of cut and uncut women (ensuring sexual morality is one&#13;
      information may lead both groups to strengthen their confidence                     of the common justifications for cutting).&#13;
      that their original beliefs are correct.                                                 Power shapes views. When a social norm benefits a particular&#13;

      set of beliefs may serve widely in a society as an unconsciously                    as god given or the natural order of things, and withholding infor-&#13;

      in some domains may shape individualsâ&#128;&#153; self-conceptions and per-                         Pluralistic ignorance shapes views. The benefit of following a&#13;

          Widespread practices shape views. When (nearly) all households                  accept it: â&#128;&#156;no one believes but everyone thinks that everyone else&#13;

    agency has increased, it has led to improvements in womenâ&#128;&#153;s welfare        THE POWER OF NORMS&#13;

    difficult to achieve. In some aspects of agency, such as political voice&#13;

    despite a century of womenâ&#128;&#153;s activism and change in other domains.&#13;

    incomes, greater access to services, and expanded infrastructure.          WHAT THIS MEANS FOR POLICY&#13;
    However, this potential impact relies in part on womenâ&#128;&#153;s increased&#13;

                                                                               but policies can change the costs or benefits of complying with pre-&#13;

    Although expansion of womenâ&#128;&#153;s rights has fostered agency in some           well as institutional structuresâ&#128;&#148;at times limit women from influenc-&#13;
    realms, the effect of laws has been weakest in areas regulating rela-      ing policies through formal political channels, womenâ&#128;&#153;s collective&#13;
    tions within households, especially as they pertain to control over        agency can work effectively through less formal channels. This in&#13;
    resources and family matters. Nor does progress in the form of legal       turn can influence policy debates, choices, and the factors that&#13;
    change necessarily result in improvements in agency, because the           themselves shape womenâ&#128;&#153;s individual agency.&#13;

                 matters most for policy?&#13;

      Asset ownership and use are often measured for         to generate income than those with a high depen-&#13;

          But comparisons of female- and male-headed         households with a male present often fare better&#13;
      households can exaggerate gender differences,          than those with no maleâ&#128;&#148;and, in some cases, do&#13;
      because they fail to account for the number of         as well as male-headed households. This finding&#13;
      working-age adults in the household and the num-       suggests that a more nuanced categorization of&#13;

      dependents to working-age adults are better able       and targeting.&#13;

    At the societal level, constraints on womenâ&#128;&#153;s      Policies aimed at increasing womenâ&#128;&#153;s participa-&#13;

            World development report 2012 : gender
            equality and development
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main message of this year's
            World Development Report is that these patterns of progress
            and persistence in gender equality matter, both for
            development outcomes and policy making. They matter because
            gender equality is a core development objective in its own
            right. But greater gender equality is also smart economics,
            enhancing productivity and improving other development
            outcomes, including prospects for the next generation and
            for the quality of societal policies and institutions.
            Economic development is not enough to shrink all gender
            disparities-corrective policies that focus on persisting
            gender gaps are essential. This report points to four
            priority areas for policy going forward. First, reducing
            gender gaps in human capital-specifically those that address
            female mortality and education. Second, closing gender gaps
            in access to economic opportunities, earnings, and
            productivity. Third, shrinking gender differences in voice
            and agency within society. Fourth, limiting the reproduction
            of gender inequality across generations. These are all areas
            where higher incomes by themselves do little to reduce
            gender gaps, but focused policies can have a real impact.
            Gender equality is at the heart of development. It's
            the right development objective, and it's smart
            economic policy. The World Development Report 2012 can help
            both countries and international partners think through and
            integrate a focus on gender equality into development policy
            making and programming.
