&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Top-Line Results&#13;
In the past year, the Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project has gone through a&#13;
period of intense implementation and learning. Global and country-level targets&#13;
for reach across all three communication channels either have been achieved or&#13;
are on track to be achieved by the end of the project (EOP):&#13;
&#13;
   · From July through December 2009, more than 20 million people&#13;
     across the four countries were exposed to mass media activities, while&#13;
     nearly 18 million were exposed from January through June 2010.&#13;
   · More than 800,000 people have been engaged through interpersonal&#13;
     communication (IPC), bringing the total number reached to more than&#13;
     2.1 million (68 percent of the EOP target).&#13;
   · More than 230,000 people have participated in direct consumer con-&#13;
     tact (DCC) events, totaling more than 615,000 reached through DCC&#13;
     (91 percent of the EOP target).&#13;
&#13;
The past six months also have provided an opportunity to learn from the inter-&#13;
ventions; adjust the approach based on lessons, additional research, and monitor-&#13;
ing information; and prepare for a final concerted push of interventions in the&#13;
final six months of the calendar year. Following the conclusion of interventions,&#13;
the impact evaluation endline surveys will roll out to capture the results of the&#13;
behavior change activities.&#13;
&#13;
The project teams have also begun working toward the transition that will take&#13;
place with the close of the project in November 2011, in the hope that implemen-&#13;
tation activities will continue afterward. Each country has undergone a process of&#13;
defining the goals of the transition and the key activities necessary to reach those&#13;
goals, and linking them back to the enabling environment plans. This exercise&#13;
has helped teams to prioritize the actions necessary in the remaining 17 months&#13;
of the project to strengthen the likelihood that interventions will be sustained&#13;
post-project.&#13;
&#13;
Enabling Environment&#13;
Each country team has made significant progress in improving the enabling envi-&#13;
ronment (EE) to sustain interventions after the project ends in November 2011.&#13;
One key area of progress has been in the establishment of partnerships with both&#13;
public and private sector organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Partnerships--In Peru, the team has achieved integration of project approach-&#13;
es with the Ministry of Education, as well as with several regional govern-&#13;
ments. In Vietnam, the Memorandum of Understanding between the Water&#13;
and Sanitation Program (WSP) and the Women's Union has already resulted&#13;
in handwashing training in 60 additional provinces in Vietnam outside of the&#13;
original areas targeted by the project. In Senegal, the project has leveraged&#13;

     In three countries, progress          partnerships with PEPAM (the French acronym for the country's Water and&#13;
                                           Sanitation Millennium Project) and the National Nutrition Program (CLM&#13;
     has been made in facilitating         in French) to strengthen sustainability of interventions. In Washington, DC,&#13;
                                           the team solidified a partnership with the Public-Private Partnership for&#13;
     the creation and distribution         Handwashing with Soap (PPPHW), developed an agenda for the University&#13;
     of handwashing stations that          of Handwashing, and facilitated support for this partnership at the global and&#13;
                                           country levels.&#13;

                                           Handwashing Stations--In three countries, progress has been made in facili-&#13;
     change after the project ends.        tating the creation and distribution of handwashing stations that will help to&#13;
                                           sustain behavior change after the project ends. For example, in Peru, 37,000&#13;
                                           Super Jaboncín soap dispensers were distributed free of charge throughout the&#13;
                                           country and are being used in households, schools, health clinics, and private&#13;
                                           sector firms to increase easy access to soap and water and are thereby reducing&#13;
                                           a major barrier to washing hands with soap. In Senegal, an assessment of hand-&#13;
                                           washing stations spurred the team to begin identifying consumer-responsive&#13;
                                           handwashing technologies.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Knowledge Products&#13;
                                           The project has accelerated production of knowledge products with a fully func-&#13;
                                           tional knowledge production and management system that routinely captures and&#13;
                                           disseminates the knowledge, lessons learned, and methodologies generated in the&#13;
                                           countries, turning them into user-friendly tools that target specific audiences. Dur-&#13;
                                           ing the past six months, 14 knowledge products were published and disseminated&#13;
                                           through a variety of channels, including international conferences, workshops,&#13;
                                           learning events, and electronically via posting on the WSP Web site. Eleven prod-&#13;
                                           ucts are in draft or in production. In addition, 25 learning events were held for local&#13;
                                           and national government representatives and nongovernmental partners.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Monitoring&#13;
                                           The global and country-level performance monitoring systems are providing im-&#13;
                                           portant performance data that helps the project management team better oversee&#13;
                                           implementation and delivery of results. The data are also shared with implement-&#13;
                                           ing agencies, clients, and the grant donor through formal meetings and reports,&#13;
                                           as well as informal discussions. The global performance monitoring system is now&#13;
                                           being used as a model for a results-based reporting system for the new WSP&#13;

                                           Impact Evaluation&#13;
                                           During the last six months, baseline data entry was completed in each of the&#13;
                                           project countries. In Peru, data analysis was completed and results from the base-&#13;
                                           line report were shared with technical teams of the ministries of education; health;&#13;
                                           women's affairs and social development; and infrastructure and sanitation. In&#13;
                                           Vietnam, baseline data was analyzed and the report distributed for comment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Because low levels of diarrhea prevalence in Vietnam make it impractical to mea-&#13;
sure sizable changes in diarrhea, a decision was made to halt the collection of&#13;
longitudinals. In Senegal, baseline data has been entered and analysis is under-&#13;
way. The team recently received data for the first four longitudinal rounds and is&#13;
currently analyzing it. In Tanzania, baseline data entry was completed and a sim-&#13;
plified baseline report is currently being developed.&#13;
&#13;
Expectations for the Next Six Months&#13;
In the remaining months of the project, the EE component assumes even more&#13;
importance as the results achieved in this component will shape the way in which&#13;
the project is scaled up, replicated, and sustained over time. By the end of Decem-&#13;
ber 2010, project activities will end in Peru, Senegal, and Vietnam and only ac-&#13;
tivities related to the impact evaluation will continue. In Tanzania, activities are&#13;
estimated to conclude no later than April 2011. Over the next six months, project&#13;
teams in all of the countries will work on formalizing their transition strategies&#13;
with key government clients and partners. Specific areas of focus include the&#13;
following:&#13;
     · Vietnam will launch DCC interventions, which are expected to reach&#13;
        about 30,000 people (the EOP target).&#13;
     · In Tanzania, DCC events will start in July and end in early October.&#13;
        A national DCC event on Global Handwashing Day will be held No-&#13;
        vember 19. The larger district DCC events (10 out of the 200) will hold&#13;
        a competition in which audience members can nominate their mothers&#13;
        for being heroes. Participants will be selected to go on stage and tell&#13;
        stories about their mothers, and the crowd will select the best story. The&#13;
        winner from each district will win a trip to participate in Global Hand-&#13;
        washing Day.&#13;
     · The Senegal team will work on packaging the M&amp;E component into a&#13;
        system easily used by the government. The team will provide training to&#13;
        government staff in the use of the monitoring system.&#13;
     · In the coming months, work will focus on further disseminating impact&#13;
        evaluation (IE) knowledge products, revising longitudinal rounds, revis-&#13;
        ing and piloting questionnaires, strengthening measurement training, and&#13;
        designing and collecting endline surveys.&#13;
     · Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit studies will be launched.&#13;
     · In November 2010, the Global Scaling Up Handwashing team will hold&#13;
        its annual meeting in New Delhi, India. This site has been chosen to maxi-&#13;
        mize the potential for integration into sanitation activities.&#13;
     · An enabling environment endline will be launched to measure progress&#13;
        made in each country on the sustainability of the interventions.&#13;
     · Finally, it is anticipated that the project team will be able to report on&#13;
        progress in improving determinants in Senegal and Vietnam.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;I.       Reaching Scale and Strengthening&#13;
         Sustainability--The Global Story&#13;
&#13;
    "We have the scientific evidence, but how to reach the mothers has been&#13;
    our weakness. The handwashing methodology has provided us with a&#13;
    practical tool to reach and to motivate mothers to adopt the habit. We&#13;
    now have the skills to better reach and engage these women."&#13;
          --Dr. José Maria Rivera Chumbes, Health Director, Moquegua, Peru&#13;
&#13;
In this reporting period, the Global Scaling Up Handwashing project intensified&#13;
implementation of programming activities to improve handwashing with soap&#13;
behaviors, and strengthened the enabling environment conditions to sustain in-&#13;
terventions beyond the end of the project in November 2011. Through the work&#13;
of the project, access to handwashing with soap (HWWS) behavior change inter-&#13;
ventions has increased dramatically in the intervention areas. This achievement&#13;
has been possible through close collaboration with partners and clients who are&#13;
supporting the interventions. This reporting period also marked a crucial period&#13;
to learn from implementation and adjust activities to achieve the greatest possible&#13;
outcomes in the final months of the project.&#13;
&#13;
The intensified implementation period has yielded significant results. Targets for&#13;
reach across all three communication channels have either been achieved, or are on&#13;
track to be achieved by the end of the project (Box 1; Figures 1 and 2; Table 1). More&#13;
than 37,000 community-based front-line workers have been trained and are deliver-&#13;
ing handwashing with soap behavior change programs to women and children (ex-&#13;
ceeding the EOP target by 20 percent). The program methodology has been refined&#13;
to better stimulate behavior change, although it will need to be adapted to the par-&#13;
ticular actors who will carry interventions forward. Project teams have used lessons&#13;
gathered from assessments, implementation, and participatory learning activities to&#13;
improve the messaging, targeting, and design of interventions. Based on these les-&#13;
sons, the final stage of activities represents WSP's best learning to date.&#13;

Through the evidence shared during the reporting period--including the increasing                Changes in the determinants&#13;

being developed. The increased capacity is manifested in improved skills to deliver the&#13;
interventions, refine monitoring approaches, improve planning, and grow a reposi-&#13;
tory of materials for training and delivering behavior change interventions.&#13;
&#13;
Considerable momentum has been generated through the large reach and in-&#13;
creasing adoption by counterparts of the HWWS activities. However, sustain-&#13;
ability of the interventions rests on the ability to demonstrate improved behavior&#13;
change and a resulting positive impact on the health and poverty status of poor&#13;
people. Under the logic of the project's results chain, WSP believes that exposure&#13;
to well-designed and evidence-based behavior change interventions will result in&#13;
improved handwashing behavior. Thus far, WSP has been unable to demonstrate&#13;
improved handwashing behavior, and the impacts are only expected after the ac-&#13;
tivities conclude. As an interim measure--to assess whether the interventions are&#13;
effective--WSP is attempting to measure changes in behavioral determinants.&#13;
Changes in the determinants are a more appropriate predictor of behavior change&#13;
than reach alone. Measuring determinants has proven to be difficult as well, with&#13;
logistical challenges in preparing the instruments, as well as difficulties in gather-&#13;
ing data for analysis. Nonetheless, the team has been able to measure some deter-&#13;
minants reliably through two different mechanisms: the piloting of scales (scaled&#13;
questions) in Peru and event impact surveys (EIS) in Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
At the conclusion of this reporting period, the project has 17 months left. In that&#13;
time frame, we will focus on capitalizing on the momentum generated through the&#13;
large-scale and on-track reach to further influence and empower our counterparts.&#13;
This will involve both drawing them more closely to the project to build their skills&#13;
and capacities, as well as supporting them in their institutional processes to for-&#13;
malize their ongoing commitment to improving handwashing behaviors. We ex-&#13;
pect to gather the necessary evidence and impacts to bolster this support, and will&#13;
continue disseminating the lessons the team is collecting globally.&#13;

                                      line workers have been trained to deliver IPC to women, caregivers, and children&#13;
                                      (exceeding the EOP target by 20 percent). As of June 30, 2010, more than&#13;
                                      2.1 million women and children have been engaged through IPC (68 percent of&#13;
                                      EOP target and up from 1.3 million just one year ago). More than 615,0000&#13;
                                      women and children have attended DCC or community promotional events&#13;
                                      (91 percent of the EOP target). During this reporting period, an estimated&#13;
                                      20.46 million (July through December 2009) and 17.98 million (January through&#13;
                                      June 2010) have been reached by mass media, in particular through radio and&#13;
                                      television spots. Given the gains in reach across these indicators, the project team&#13;
                                      is confident that Programming will reach the intended numbers of women and&#13;

contracted to support and oversee activities in 14 of the 24 regions; in eight other&#13;
regions, four regional coordinators were recruited; in the other two regions, where&#13;
only mass media and DCC events have been held, the project team decided that&#13;
neither a field-based coordinating firm nor a coordinator was required. The facili-&#13;
tating agencies and regional coordinators play a pivotal role in the intervention&#13;
execution. They engage partners to broaden the reach of the project and share&#13;
tools that contribute to consistent messaging. They also train master trainers, who&#13;
in turn train the IPC front-line workers--principally health care providers, local&#13;
community development workers, and teachers.&#13;
&#13;
IPC activities target two audiences: i) mothers via community-based workers,&#13;
including health providers and community development volunteers; and ii) pri-&#13;
mary school students via teachers. Based on formative research conducted in&#13;
2004, the IPC seeks to build motivation to wash hands, increase knowledge on&#13;
the importance of handwashing with soap, and improve skills to manage soap&#13;
and water. The IPC is delivered through front-line workers who convene small&#13;
group meetings or visit mothers at home (Box 2). Their aim is to reach mothers&#13;
through two to three sessions, during which three main topic areas are discussed&#13;
in the order indicated in Table 3.&#13;

                                                       communications concept for mass media and direct consumer contact, featuring&#13;
       DCC events focus on the                         a superhero named Super Jaboncín (SJ) who gains the power to fight germs by&#13;
       power of soap and water                         adding soap to water. The SJ concept forms the basis of DCC events. Larger&#13;

       soap and water through the                      developed, which includes: i) a superhero costume; ii) three games with large&#13;
       Super Jaboncin character.                       props to engage audience participation; iii) support materials (such as posters and&#13;
                                                       comic strips featuring the superhero) to distribute to the audience; and iv) a guide&#13;
                                                       on how to use the kit materials and conduct an event. The kit also includes an&#13;

                                                       first introduces SJ and his power (I discover the power); in the second, the audience&#13;
                                                       learns they can appropriate SJ's power by using soap (I have the power); in the&#13;
                                                       third, the listener lets others have the power of SJ (I share the power). Together, the&#13;
                                                       spots mirror the development of a new social norm--that of handwashing with&#13;

soap. The radio spots and a related song or jingle have been broadcast in three&#13;
waves: October­December '09, April­July '10, and August­October '10. In&#13;
terms of content, the radio spots are designed to remind mothers of the four criti-&#13;
cal times to handwash with soap, and stress the importance of washing hands&#13;
with soap immediately before or after these critical times. They also remind moth-&#13;
ers to place the soap next to the latrine or in the kitchen. To build continuity from&#13;
the first phase, the radio spots (and related print materials) reprise the first-phase&#13;
slogan, Manos Limpios, Niños Sanos (Clean Hands, Healthy Children).&#13;
&#13;
Over the life of the project, nearly 300,000 women and children have been&#13;
reached through IPC, with 300,000 through DCC events. Mass media activities&#13;
in Peru have exposed hundreds of thousands of people, and in one period, mil-&#13;
lions, to the handwashing with soap message:&#13;

                                                       tions, and as of June 30, 2010, an additional 40,000 women and children had&#13;
                                                       been reached through IPC activities and 27,000 by DCC events.&#13;

                                                       team built on insights generated from a learning event held in December 2009,&#13;

&#13;
2,000 people at a time. Delivered by specially trained animateurs, the program&#13;
focuses on building the intention and commitment of women to improve hand-&#13;
washing. It involves, among others things, presentations of the television com-&#13;
mercial, handwashing with soap demonstrations, and a question and answer&#13;
session to engage audience members and refresh basic knowledge. The events also&#13;
include testimonials from women and government authorities to reinforce the&#13;
emerging local norms of improved handwashing behavior. Two firms implement&#13;
the DCC, one each in northern and southern regions.&#13;
&#13;
Mass media channels such as billboards, television, and radio are useful to convey&#13;
the overarching communications concept and provide an umbrella slogan or vi-&#13;
suals for all other channels. Senegal enjoys a good coverage of mid-sized bill-&#13;
boards even in peri-urban areas. Television and radio broadcasts in Senegal have&#13;
relatively high coverage, and for habitual behaviors such as handwashing, the TV&#13;
and radio spots provide reminders or cues to action, particularly if aired during&#13;
times when mothers are preparing meals. The mass media plan also utilizes the&#13;
results of research to focus on building the intention and commitment of women&#13;
to practice improved handwashing behavior, and is executed through billboards,&#13;
television and radio spots. Two firms are executing the mass media: one designed&#13;
the concept and produced materials; another developed the media plan and pur-&#13;
chased radio, television, and billboard space. This same firm also monitors the&#13;
airwaves to ensure the media plan.&#13;
&#13;
Over the life of the project, behavior change interventions in Senegal have been&#13;
scaled up, reaching--and in some cases surpassing--intended targets. An esti-&#13;
mated 2.7 million people have been reached by almost 120 television and 1,700&#13;
radio spots (exceeding EOP targets by 63%); more than 160,000 have been&#13;
reached through DCC events (75% of EOP); and 189,000 have been reached&#13;
through IPC programs by 219 trained community outreach workers, or relays&#13;
(57% EOP). The project has strong monitoring and supervision mechanisms in&#13;
place to ensure quantity and quality of the interventions.&#13;

Mass media involving radio spots, call-in shows, and DJ mentions ran from Feb-&#13;
ruary through April of 2009 and focused on the health benefits of handwashing&#13;
with soap at critical junctures. The programs were aired on national stations and&#13;
one regional station, reaching an estimated 16 million women and children. In&#13;
the second phase, the radio programs will carry the "Ahsante Mama" message ex-&#13;
ecuted through radio spots, soap operas, and DJ mentions. Radio spots highlight&#13;
the many important things mothers teach us, such as washing hands with soap.&#13;
The soap operas, which integrate handwashing and sanitation, have included a&#13;
mother who is recognized for her importance in the family. In DJ mentions, the&#13;
DJ will invite people to write a letter with the reason their mother is a heroine,&#13;
which the DJ then links to the many important things mothers teach us, includ-&#13;
ing washing hands with soap. Each week leading up to Global Handwashing Day,&#13;
the DJ will choose the top three stories. All three components will run every day&#13;

Vietnam&#13;
The project in Vietnam has delivered improved handwashing behavior inter-&#13;
ventions at a truly large scale. Since 2007, the program has improved the inter-&#13;
ventions to incorporate learnings from the field. In particular, IPC has evolved&#13;
from traditional health education to practical skills and solutions, as well as&#13;
aspirational messaging aligned with the DCC and mass media. During this re-&#13;
porting period, almost 620,000 women and children in the target group were&#13;
reached through IPC and 14,620,000 through mass media. DCC activities&#13;
have not been implemented in the past six months but are anticipated to roll&#13;
out in Fall 2010.&#13;
&#13;
IPC activities have all been completed in four out of the seven project provinces,&#13;
and will continue in the three remaining provinces included in the impact evalua-&#13;
tion up to October 2010. IPC interventions have benefitted from multiple stages&#13;
of implementation. Now on the third iteration, IPC activities are implemented by&#13;
the Vietnam Women's Union, and are based on formative research, lessons from&#13;
the project implementation in Peru, and the implementation experience. It seeks&#13;
to build motivation to wash hands, increase knowledge on the importance of&#13;
handwashing with soap at critical times, and improve skills to manage soap and&#13;
water through three sessions. The activities are carried out in a variety of venues:&#13;
Mother's Group member meetings, household visits, Grandparent's Group mem-&#13;
ber meetings, Women's Union member meetings, Women's Club member meet-&#13;
ings, and market meetings (Illustration 5). Through this comprehensive targeting,&#13;
women receive behavior change messages multiple times.&#13;

the tagline "Remember to Wash Your Hands with Soap for Children's Health and&#13;
Development" was developed to include in all promotional products and materi-&#13;
als. Television spots were re-launched in March 2010 and will air nightly until&#13;
January 2011.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the project has also researched, developed, and implemented a pro-&#13;
gram for primary school-age children. The children's program features the adven-&#13;
tures of Bi, a boy who discovers the power of soap and water, and is carried out&#13;
via IPC, DCC, and mass media. During a first round, IPC and DCC were carried&#13;
out in 272 schools in 260 communes, along with 12 urban schools under the&#13;
Three Coastal Cities project, ultimately reaching almost 108,800 students. Dur-&#13;
ing a second round, IPC and DCC activities were carried out in one school per&#13;
each of 240 communes, reaching approximately 96,000 students. Additionally,&#13;
comic strips were published in 10 issues of a Vietnamese youth magazine from&#13;

Component 2: Strengthening the Enabling Environment&#13;
&#13;
     The Enabling Environment (EE) is designed to develop and/or strengthen the&#13;
     institutional and policy/strategy environment in which handwashing with&#13;
     soap programs can be scaled up and sustained. The EE for this project has&#13;
     nine dimensions: policy, strategy, and direction; institutional arrangements;&#13;
     program methodology; implementation capacity; availability of products and&#13;
     tools; financing; cost-effective implementation; monitoring and evaluation;&#13;
     and partnership. Each project country updates progress in the EE component&#13;
     across the nine dimensions once a year using a spider diagram.&#13;
&#13;
During this reporting period, significant gains have been made in the way in&#13;
which WSP's clients use the technical support, advice, tools, and approaches pro-&#13;
vided. The extent to which this use is affecting the scale and reach of project&#13;
programs, the integration of project components into existing projects, and fund-&#13;
ing levels defines important outcomes of the project.&#13;
&#13;
In the remaining months of the project, the EE assumes even more importance&#13;
because the results achieved in this component will shape the way in which&#13;
the project is scaled up, replicated, and sustained over time. As part of the EE,&#13;
each country team developed a measurable transition strategy focusing on key&#13;
entry points for uptake and use of project results. Many of these entry points--&#13;
whether public institutions, development partners, non-formal groups, or private&#13;
sector organizations--are already using many of the products and approaches de-&#13;
veloped by the project. The objective of the transition strategy is to maintain and&#13;
advance the scaling up of national handwashing promotion after completion of&#13;
the project in November 2011. The strategy defines what at-scale handwashing&#13;
promotion would look like in 2012 and, with that outcome identified, works&#13;

Regional governments have played a critical role in implementing the hand-&#13;
washing initiative, issuing policies to promote the adoption of the project ap-&#13;
proach (both behavior change and monitoring methodologies); allocating&#13;
budgets for handwashing promotion; integrating handwashing behavior change&#13;
into various programs aimed at improving children's health and nutrition; and&#13;
promoting community events and mass media campaigns. In addition, they&#13;
scale up training of trainers and monitor the effectiveness and impact of behav-&#13;
ior change. Arequipa has approved US$300,000 to widen the scope of the proj-&#13;
ect in the region; Cajamarca and Tumbes have developed similar projects now&#13;
awaiting approval.&#13;
&#13;
NGOs have been contracted by WSP to carry out the School and Community&#13;
program (IPC, DCC and mass media) in some regions. With this strengthened&#13;
capacity, they will play a role as a resource for regional governments and other&#13;
initiatives to contract to implement interventions.&#13;
&#13;
Private sector companies, such as those in mining and agriculture, have allocated&#13;
resources--human and financial--to the promotion of handwashing activities.&#13;
Following the transition, they will play a role in financing and occasionally imple-&#13;
menting interventions within regions and districts, in partnership with the local&#13;
and regional public sector.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has utilized the project in support of water and health projects,&#13;
adopting some components for the Juntos program and the Pronasar water proj-&#13;
ect. The Bank would continue to play a critical role in supporting national and&#13;
local efforts to promote handwashing at scale, through operations in nutrition,&#13;
health, education, and water and sanitation.&#13;

Additionally, a national M&amp;E system is emerging through the development of&#13;
new sanitation and hygiene indicators and targets in the National Growth and&#13;
Poverty Reduction Strategy (MKUKUTA II) and standardized definitions within&#13;
the new sanitation and hygiene policy, all of which WSP has contributed to along&#13;
with development partners and government.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare's Department of Preventative Services&#13;
has been pushing the passage of a national Sanitation and Hygiene Policy (which&#13;
is set to go before the cabinet in December). Additionally, it has supported the&#13;
formation of a pan-ministerial National Sanitation and Hygiene Steering Com-&#13;
mittee and has been supporting development of a National Sanitation and Hy-&#13;
giene Program. In the future, it is envisioned that the MoHSW will take the lead&#13;
on implementing a combined training package of rural sanitation and HWWS&#13;
for IPC activities. If DCC will be used in the future by the MoHSW under rural&#13;
sanitation initiatives then HWWS messages can be integrated into those events.&#13;
Mass media activities would potentially come from Water Sector Development&#13;
Program (WSDP, the government of Tanzania's water supply and sanitation&#13;
SWaP) funding. It will also work on improving school handwashing.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Water and Irrigation has been responsible for implementing&#13;
sanitation and handwashing activities under the WSDP. However, the ministry&#13;
has been focused on delivering its water responsibilities, and so the sanitation&#13;
and handwashing work has not received adequate attention, and may be moved&#13;
to the MoHSW. In the future, the MoWI would be responsible for school in-&#13;
frastructure, providing handwashing facilities and promoting handwashing&#13;
with soap in schools. Additionally, MoWI has contracted consultants for each&#13;
district to develop District Water and Sanitation plans. There is an opportunity&#13;
to influence the consultants' guidance to include project approaches in the dis-&#13;
trict plans.&#13;
&#13;
Other ministries, such as the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training and&#13;
the Prime Minister's Office­Regional Administration and Local Government&#13;
have been working with MoHSW and MoWI on school hygiene, including de-&#13;
veloping new national guidelines hygiene promotional materials and curriculum&#13;
for teachers.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has been funding the WSDP, and has been critical in advocating&#13;
for sanitation and hygiene. It is currently restructuring its loan in order to&#13;
strengthen the sanitation and hygiene component, including strengthening the&#13;
approach and indicators.&#13;

activities to be carried forward after project funding ends. The interventions will&#13;
likely be a limited version of the IPC, carried out during quarterly meetings and&#13;
possibly through the household sanitation program of "The Three Cleans and&#13;
Five Nos." Additionally, WSP will participate with the national Women's Union&#13;
in a visioning exercise about how the organization will carry handwashing with&#13;
soap to a larger scale under alternate funding sources after the project ends. The&#13;
Women's Union may conduct some DCC activities on a limited scale around&#13;
festival days at the communal level. To support this work, WSP will need to de-&#13;
velop a menu of DCC options that the Women's Union can draw from.&#13;
&#13;
The Department of Education and Training implemented with WSP support a&#13;
children's program in 2009 that has been carried out in 512 schools, reaching ap-&#13;
proximately 200,000 students. After the transition, the vision is for the Women's&#13;
Union to advocate for the provincial Departments of Education and Training to&#13;
scale up the children's program to the remaining schools in the seven project&#13;
provinces and three coastal cities.&#13;
&#13;
Unilever is currently implementing a mass media campaign around five critical&#13;
junctures (the four usual junctures, plus body washing), and promotes handwash-&#13;
ing with soap in ten provinces via coordination with the MoH's immunization&#13;
work, wherein mothers are given soap and reminders about proper handwashing&#13;
when their children receive vaccines. After the transition, it is envisioned that Uni-&#13;
lever will implement Lifebuoy handwashing promotion through mass media ac-&#13;
tivities and DCC events around festival days.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has implemented handwashing activities in two projects, Three&#13;
Coastal Cities and Red River Delta. Looking toward the transition, the World&#13;
Bank has several projects being developed that may provide opportunities for&#13;
integration of handwashing activities.&#13;

Component 3: Learning&#13;
&#13;
     Learning is designed to take a proactive and strategic approach to the learn-&#13;
     ing process to ensure responsive knowledge products are developed and shared&#13;
     with other programmers in the field to encourage knowledge uptake, adapta-&#13;
     tion and replication.&#13;
&#13;
This period marked the successful scaling up of production and the dissemination&#13;
of knowledge products, learning activities, and presentations.&#13;
&#13;
In January 2010, design templates for Working Papers/Technical Papers, Learn-&#13;
ing Notes, and a brochure were finalized and implemented, providing a common&#13;
look-and-feel for all project publications. In the past six months, 14 publications&#13;
were produced and disseminated (Table 4, Illustrations 6 and 7) and 11&#13;
more were in draft or production. To facilitate the development of knowledge&#13;

conducted pre- and post-DCC event. Results suggest that the two key behav-&#13;
ioral determinants, knowledge and intention, being targeted are improving&#13;
among those exposed to the DCC. Figures 4 and 5 show findings for a total of&#13;
1474 respondents (727 pre- and 747 post-event) surveyed at 28 events con-&#13;

Performance Monitoring&#13;
WSP's global monitoring system has been in place now for three reporting&#13;
periods. During this reporting period, the global and country teams have&#13;
improved the design and use of the monitoring systems. In a sector known&#13;
to be lacking in monitoring capacities and consensus on approaches and in-&#13;
dicators to use when monitoring behavior change and handwashing with&#13;
soap in general, the project teams have moved the field forward, demonstrat-&#13;
ing that performance monitoring is a key component of a handwashing in-&#13;
tervention. In an effort to further refine the design of the global Management&#13;
Information System (MIS) and apply what has been learned in the countries&#13;
and globally, in the next reporting period WSP will hold a learning event on&#13;
the MIS.&#13;

     useful to the school environmental committee and to see where we are&#13;
     failing."&#13;
       --Husares de Junin School Principal, El Agustino District, Lima Province&#13;
&#13;
There is now evidence at the national and local levels that government clients and&#13;
other partners are using project monitoring tools to monitor newly emerging&#13;
handwashing programs:&#13;
   · The Ministry of Education is now using and quoting project monitoring&#13;
       and evaluation (M&amp;E) data as part of the national program.&#13;
   · The project helped the Cajamarca M&amp;E Committee develop a presenta-&#13;
       tion on the Regional Nutrition Program, including IPC data and monitor-&#13;
       ing information from the project.&#13;
   · The project provided IPC M&amp;E training to staff of the regional govern-&#13;
       ment, municipalities, health and education sectors, and private firms&#13;
       in Piura. Each institution will collect relevant information, consolidate&#13;
       the data, and deliver it to the GORE using the formats proposed by the&#13;
       project.&#13;
   · The Regional Health Office (DIRESA) in Lima is using the project's IPC&#13;
       quality assessment form to evaluate handwashing sessions implemented by&#13;
       health staff, and using project tools to monitor their activities.&#13;
   · The Local Education Unit (UGEL) of Requena participated in an immer-&#13;
       sion workshop where participants received IPC monitoring training.&#13;
&#13;
Senegal&#13;
Earlier reports have described Senegal's monitoring system. During the final&#13;
phase of intervention activities, the monitoring system will capture IPC and&#13;
DCC progress through reports from the contracted firms. These will be validated&#13;
independently through four field supervisors hired directly by the Senegal proj-&#13;
ect. Mass media implementation will be monitored via reports against the media&#13;
plan from the media placement agency. The information will be aggregated into&#13;
the MIS which can produce standard and customized reports that enable the&#13;
team to track actual results and analyze the situation along a variety of dimen-&#13;
sions, such as region and implementing agency.&#13;
&#13;
The government of Senegal has expressed interest in getting support for M&amp;E,&#13;
and over the coming months the Senegal team will work on packaging the M&amp;E&#13;
component into a system usable by the government, and then training them in&#13;
its use.&#13;

                                                        (FLA). The FLA records the number and type of meetings held, the demograph-&#13;

                                                        because FLAs are volunteers, there is little incentive for them to submit the forms&#13;
                                                        (roughly 22 percent of FLAs submit forms), so data is spotty. Additionally, there&#13;
                                                        is a challenge of validating the data, which is currently entirely self-reported. To&#13;

&#13;
Based on this data, WSP and the Women's Union agreed on the need to move the&#13;

hands with soap, convincing more people to put soap in handwashing areas, and&#13;
motivating those who wash their hands with soap to make it a habit.&#13;

Impact Evaluation&#13;
During the last six months, baseline data entry was completed in each of the&#13;
project countries, and we anticipate having cross-country data analysis in the next&#13;
reporting period.&#13;
&#13;
Peru&#13;
Data analysis was completed and results from the baseline report were shared in&#13;
February in a meeting with the technical teams of the ministries of education;&#13;
health; women's affairs and social development; and infrastructure and sanitation.&#13;
WSP presented the details and design of the Peru IE study and shared results of&#13;
the baseline data. Government counterparts expressed interest in the rigor and&#13;
depth of the study, and specifically requested additional capacity building and&#13;
knowledge transfer activities. The Peru baseline report is in press. Six rounds of&#13;
longitudinal data have been collected and analyzed. Early analysis showed signs&#13;
of fatigue and decreasing diarrhea rates, suggesting a need to halt further&#13;
collection.&#13;
&#13;
Vietnam&#13;
Baseline data has been analyzed, and a baseline report was drafted and distributed&#13;
for comments to the country and expert teams. Because low levels of diarrhea&#13;
prevalence in Vietnam make it impractical to measure sizable changes in diarrhea,&#13;
a decision was made to halt the collection of longitudinals.&#13;
&#13;
Senegal&#13;
Baseline data has been entered and analysis is underway. The team recently re-&#13;
ceived data for the first four longitudinal rounds and is currently analyzing it.&#13;

&amp;#12;III.             Challenges, Emerging Learnings,&#13;
                 and Project Responses&#13;
&#13;
Three-and-a-half years into the project, a number of challenges and learnings&#13;
have emerged. These include:&#13;
   · Importance of a handwashing station to support behavior change in-&#13;
      tentions: The hardware serves a number of purposes in the intervention:&#13;
      It facilitates the practice of handwashing, may strengthen the social norm&#13;
      of improved handwashing, may inspire aspirational motivations to im-&#13;
      prove handwashing behaviors, and, if properly placed, reminds families&#13;
      of the need to wash with soap at critical junctures. Additionally, when&#13;
      working with counterparts who are uncomfortable with software (often&#13;
      ministries of water), promoting a technology is something to which they&#13;
      can relate. This makes a strong case for attention to handwashing stations,&#13;
      particularly to investing resources into products that respond to consumer&#13;
      demand within cost constraints.&#13;
   · Changing the mind-set of clients and agencies takes time and evi-&#13;
      dence: Many counterparts--from public, private, and NGO sectors--&#13;
      come to the intervention with preconceived ideas of hygiene interventions&#13;
      and typically fall back on germ-focused messages along with PHAST-type&#13;
      interventions. It takes considerable time, effort, attention, and handhold-&#13;
      ing to work with these counterparts to move to a positive-orientation,&#13;
      evidence-based approach to behavior change.&#13;
   · Monitoring effectiveness of behavior change interventions requires&#13;
      follow-up research: So far, WSP's monitoring system can capture the&#13;
      reach of the IPC, DCC, and MM interventions, but to understand the&#13;
      quality of the interventions, the team must conduct special surveys or&#13;
      wait for the endline surveys and the impacts. There is clearly a need to&#13;
      ensure that interventions are effective in changing behaviors, and if not,&#13;
      they must be adjusted. This becomes a greater challenge at large scale. In&#13;
      Tanzania, the team is implementing event impact surveys to understand&#13;
      how an event changes knowledge and intention, but a systematic approach&#13;
      must be developed. This may require a balance among supervision and&#13;
      independent spot checks, with an emphasis on regular learning meetings,&#13;
      quality monitoring tools to track indicators such as increases in handwash-&#13;
      ing stations, and capacity building.&#13;
   · Changing the role of community outreach workers into a commu-&#13;
      nity resource requires specialized skills: It's common for community&#13;
      outreach workers to simply disseminate information. To help them take&#13;
      on an expanded role in which they help caretakers identify solutions to&#13;
      handwashing challenges and negotiate with other members of the family&#13;
      to prioritize handwashing, they need special skills in communication. To&#13;
      date, the focus of the interventions has been on building their understand-&#13;
      ing of the content rather than on facilitating behavior change among the&#13;
      target groups.&#13;

&amp;#12;     IV.   Project Management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       In March 2010, the project TTL in Tanzania, Abdul Badru, left WSP for another&#13;
                       organization. Yolande Coombes, the WSP-AF regional sanitation and hygiene&#13;
                       specialist based in Nairobi, Kenya, was assigned the TTL responsibilities for the&#13;
                       HWWS project in Tanzania. To provide additional assistance to the Tanzania&#13;
                       team, Craig Kullmann, previously based in Washington, D.C., has temporarily&#13;
                       relocated to Dar es Salaam from June to December 2010.&#13;
&#13;
                       In June 2010, Hnin Hnin Pyne, the senior technical advisor for the Global Scal-&#13;
                       ing Up Handwashing project, moved to the World Bank Institute for 67 percent&#13;
                       of her time until December 2010. After that date, her duties will be assumed by&#13;
                       task-specific consultancies, as well as by Nathaniel Paynter, water and sanitation&#13;
                       specialist in D.C.&#13;
&#13;
                       As the program concludes implementation of activities in 2010 and moves to&#13;
                       learning and transition activities in 2011, country staffing may be reduced. This&#13;
                       is to be expected as staff members begin looking for other jobs in anticipation of&#13;
                       the close of project in November 2011. WSP is working to ensure there is suffi-&#13;
                       cient staffing at national and global levels to deliver on the project goals and&#13;
                       commitments.&#13;

            Global Scaling up Handwashing Project :
            progress report (July 1, 2009 - June 30, 2010)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Global scaling up handwashing is a Water
            and Sanitation (WSP) project focused on applying innovative
            behavior-change approaches to improve handwashing with soap
            behavior among women of reproductive age (ages 15-49) and
            primary school age children (ages 5-9). It is being
            implemented by local and national governments with technical
            support from WSP in four countries: Peru, Senegal, Tanzania,
            and Vietnam. In the past year, the Global Scaling Up
            Handwashing Project has gone through a period of intense
            implementation and learning. Global and country-level
            targets for reach across all three communication channels
            either have been achieved or are on track to be achieved by
            the end of the project (EOP): 1) from July through December
            2009, more than 20 million people across the four countries
            were exposed to mass media activities, while nearly 18
            million were exposed from January through June 2010; 2) more
            than 800,000 people have been engaged through interpersonal
            communication (IPC), bringing the total number reached to
            more than 2.1 million (68 percent of the EOP target); and 3)
            more than 230,000 people have participated in direct
            consumer contact (DCC) events, totaling more than 615,000
            reached through DCC (91 percent of the EOP target).
