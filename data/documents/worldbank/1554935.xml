INDIA: PAPERS ON DEMAND AND SUPPLY PROSPECTS FOR AGRICULTURE&#13;
October 1981&#13;
Since India's foodgrain situation began to improve after the&#13;
mid-1970s, the World Bank's economic work on Indian agriculture has&#13;
concentrated on the implications of this development both for foodgrains and&#13;
for other major agricultural commodities.   This volume contains several&#13;
papers that report on work accomplished so far. Jon Hitchings' paper&#13;
projects demand for major agriculture commodities through the year 2000 based&#13;
on consumption expenditure data from the 1973/74 National Sample Survey along&#13;
w4th estimates of future population and income growth, rates of urbanization&#13;
and trends in the distribution of income. The analysis reveals the&#13;
differential effects of long-run income growth, and other factors, on demand&#13;
for various crops. The individual commodity papers were prepared to analyze&#13;
the long-run supply prospects and to compare these with the projected demand.&#13;
The foodgrain paper, prepared by James Harrison and John Wall, raises the&#13;
distinct possibility of foodgrain self-sufficiency and even a potential for&#13;
an eventual exportable surplus.   The vegetable oil paper, by John Wall, is&#13;
less optimistic and projects a persistent domestic shortage of vegetable&#13;
oils. This underlines the need for greater efforts by the agricultural&#13;
support institutions to stimulate oilseed production and for an incentive&#13;
pricing policy. The sugar paper, by James Harrison, analyzes the sugar cycle&#13;
and stresses the disruptive effects of very large fluctuations around the&#13;
production trend, which is essentially adequate to meet domestic requirements&#13;
and provide for some exports. The utility of maintaining a buffer stock of&#13;
sugar to stabilize year-to-year sugar supply is discussed.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
This paper reports a set of demand projections for agricultural&#13;
commodities in India.   The main objective was to assess the effects of&#13;
income growth, population growth and other non-price variables on the&#13;
future pattern of consumption of agricultural commodities in India. A&#13;
second objective was the development of a projection model that would be&#13;
compact, flexible and fully documented. The model should be capable of&#13;
projecting demand for any number of commodities and future time periods&#13;
in a single pass with a minimum of file manipulation. It should also&#13;
readily accommodate altered assumptions regarding urbanization,&#13;
expenditure growth, income redistribution and population growth. The&#13;
resulting model is documented separately. 1/&#13;
The 28th Round of the National Sample Survey (1973/74) is the most&#13;
recent large-scale expenditure survey available. The 32nd Round (1977/78)&#13;
is also directed to household expenditures, but it has not yet been&#13;
released. Restricted to this data base, the projections assume relative&#13;
prices are constant, and model only the demand side of the market.&#13;
Projections for 17 commodities at five year intervals, expenditure&#13;
elasticities, and calorie demand per capita are presented and compared&#13;
with other research. Changes in income distribution and consequent&#13;
effects on demand received particular attention. 2/ Sensitivity analysis&#13;
was performed on expenditure and population growth, expenditure&#13;
distribution, and urbanization. As a final step in sensitivity analysis,&#13;
estimates were made of the elasticities of future demand with respect to&#13;
key assumptions.&#13;
I. DATA AND METHODOLOGY&#13;
A. Population Projections. Four types of data were required for&#13;
the projections: population and urban share projections, the starting&#13;
quantities of consumption, the sectoral distribution of initial&#13;
consumption, and expenditure data from a household consumption survey.&#13;
The population and urbanization forecasts that were used are given in&#13;
Table 1. Historical figures for the urban share of the population show a&#13;
growth rate of about 0.2% per year. 3/ Projections made by the UN&#13;
Population Division/Urbanization show a general but bumpy continuation of&#13;

Hitchings, Division Paper for ASADB (March 25, 1981). Available from&#13;
the India Division of the World Bank, Washington, D.C.&#13;
2/ Appendix II contains a program for estimating Gini coefficients.&#13;

share, Population Reference Bureau, which interpolated&#13;
projections from U.N. Population Division/Urbanization.&#13;
The urban share for 1999/2000 was somewhat arbitrarily&#13;
lowered from a U.N. projection of 34.0% which implied&#13;
an abnormally large increase in the last five years of&#13;
the century. The population forecasts are also reported&#13;
in Population Projections 1980-2000, World Bank, DEDHR,&#13;
(July, 1980), p. 212.&#13;

this trend and are used without modification by the World Bank and the&#13;
Population Reference Bureau. Their figures were utilized in this analysis&#13;
except that the estimate for 1999/2000 has been modified. 1/&#13;
The latest World Bank population projections were used in this&#13;
study. However, provisional 1981 population census data have been&#13;
released which show higher-than-expected rates of growth during the 1970s.&#13;
Although the population forecasts have not yet been altered accordingly,&#13;
the potential implications of the new census data for the demand&#13;
projections are presented and discussed with other sensitivity analysis&#13;
issues in Section IV.&#13;
B. Baseline Consumption.    Estimates of total baseline consumption&#13;
for 1973/74, the year of the household expenditure survey, are compared in&#13;
Table 2. The organization of the table follows the expenditure&#13;
classifications of the NSS survey. A list of commodities in each category&#13;
appears in Appendix V. World Bank estimates were used whenever available.&#13;
Total consumption of cereals was allocated to categories such as wheat,&#13;
maize, etc., using weights implicit in FAO data. Sweeteners were&#13;
disaggregated using unpublished tabulations from the NSS survey. The&#13;
quantity of clothing estimate is based on production minus non-fabric2&#13;
uses. 2/ However, using the standard industry conversion rate of 10 m2/kg,&#13;
0.722 million tons of "clothing" corresponds to 7.22 billion square meters&#13;
of material which is only 6% below an independent industry estimate of&#13;
7.68 billion square meters. 3/ The industry estimate for woven textiles&#13;
includes cotton, synthetic, and blended fabrics. Technically, the&#13;
projections should be increased by a few percent to better represent&#13;
expenditures on non-cotton textiles which were recorded in the survey, and&#13;
which increased the expenditure elasticities. Using the lower base allows&#13;
the projections to be interpreted more in terms of demand for cotton, but&#13;
introduces a small downward bias.&#13;
1/ See the note on Table 1.&#13;
2/ In the expenditure survey, "clothing" includes bedding, upholstery,&#13;
and other textiles.&#13;

Fixed grossing factors for non-household demand (seed, feed,&#13;
minimal industrial use, and loss) are shown for foodgrains and edible&#13;
oils. Future demand for these commodities represents total demand,&#13;
whereas projections for other items refer only to household demand.&#13;
As a consistency check, baseline quantities for food can be&#13;
compared with the population estimate in terms of calories per capita per&#13;
day. The conversion from weight to calories utilized foodgrain equivalent&#13;
factors shown in Appendix IV. The level of food availability implied by&#13;
the selected baseline quantities is quite consistent with other estimates:&#13;
1,952 calories per capita per day (Table 7).&#13;
Production indices in 1973/74 for foodgrains contracted somewhat,&#13;
but were comparable with other below-average years, such as 1970/71 and&#13;
1976/77. Cereal production in calendar 1973 was 5% below the surrounding&#13;
five-year average. However, an increase in net cereals imports in 1973,&#13;
which partially offset the production shortfall, the reasonableness of the&#13;
per capita calorie estimate, and the fact that FAQ base quantities which&#13;
were adopted for some commodities were already three-year averages, led to&#13;
a decision to dispense with more elaborate modifications of the base level&#13;
of total consumption to adjust for starting period aberrations.&#13;
Consumers may have been adjusting expenditures to rapid price&#13;
increases in 1973/74. Price indices for major agricultural commodities&#13;
rose rapidly in the early 1970's, particularly 1973-75, in contrast to the&#13;
more stable pteice environment of the late 1960's. These considerations&#13;
highlight a second area of potential sensitivity of the projections to the&#13;
base year chosen. Set against these precautionary notes is the rather&#13;
uniform set of expenditure elasticities obtained from various sources and&#13;
time periods which are compared with estimates from these data in the&#13;
following section. The similarity suggests typical patterns of demand may&#13;
not have been too disrupted by these price movements.&#13;
Weights for sectoral consumption are required to combine urban&#13;
and rural demand into a national estimate. Quantity-based weights should&#13;
be used to avoid price differentials and these were derived from the NSS&#13;
survey for edible oils, sweeteners, and cereals. Value-based weights&#13;
without price adjustment were used for the other commodities.&#13;
A detailed exposition of the methodology adopted for projections&#13;
is presented in a separate paper, available from the India Division of the&#13;
World Bank, "Documentation of a Demand Projection Model Prepared for&#13;
India." The principal features of the approach are outlined below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
C. Estimation Approach. Cross-sectional survey data from the NSS&#13;
28th round were used to estimate expenditure regressions and elasticities.&#13;
1/ Generalized least squares (GLS) regressions were run on the expenditure&#13;
survey data using the ratio semilog inverse functional form. 2/ This form&#13;
automatically satisfies the Engel aggregation condition of consumer demand&#13;
theory since the dependent variables are budget shares. 3/ (If this&#13;
condition were not met, the sum of marginal propensities to consume would&#13;
not exhaust marginal expenditure which would introduce awkward&#13;
inconsistencies into a set of demand projections). The functional form&#13;
also does not impose an a priori relationship between the income level and&#13;
the elasticity. One regression per commodity or commodity group was used&#13;
to estimate the elasticity expression for all expenditure classes. The&#13;
expression yields distinct elasticities for each expenditure class when it&#13;
is evaluated using that group's mean total expenditure, and mean&#13;
commodity-specific expenditure. Thus projections for each income level&#13;
utilize separate elasticities, although they are derived from a single&#13;
regression. GLS methods are needed to compensate for the heteroscedastic&#13;
properties of grouped data having different numbers of observations per&#13;
group. Persons per household times households per class formed the&#13;
weights.&#13;
Future demand was geared to the growth rate of expenditure in the&#13;
economy, which can be selected at will during a computer projection run.&#13;
From this growth rate, urban and rural per capita expenditure growth rates&#13;
were derived for each projection period (base date to projection date)&#13;
which are consistent with:&#13;
a) the selected total rate of expenditure expansion;&#13;
b) population growth and urbanization rates;&#13;
1/ National Sample Survey Organization, Tables on Consumer Expenditure,&#13;
28th Round, No. 240, Department of Statistics (1977), New Delhi.&#13;
2/ This form is Y/X = a + b ln X + c/X where Y is the commodity expendi-&#13;
ture and X is the total expenditure. The expenditure elasticity is&#13;
then e = (a + b + b lnX) X/Y.&#13;
3/ Price data would be necessary to check the other conditions, namely&#13;
the negativity of the own substitution effect, the symmetry of&#13;
cross-substitution effects, and homogeneity of degree zero for the&#13;
system of demand equations. (The last condition implies that multi-&#13;
plication of prices and income by a constant would leave demand pat-&#13;
terns unchanged, i.e., there is no "money illusion" in consumption.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
c) historical rates of growth between the base year and the most&#13;
recent observation--about 3.5% in real terms from 1973/74 to&#13;
1979/80.&#13;
Table 3 of the documentation paper provides evidence that since 1961,&#13;
there has been very little difference between the sectors in nominal per&#13;
capita expenditure growth rates. Consequently, none is assumed here.&#13;
An annual rate of change in the Gini ratio can also be selected&#13;
during program execution. The effects of redistribution on demand are&#13;
incornporated through a reallocation rule which satisfies the Gini ratio&#13;
modification in such a way that changes in expenditure are proportionate&#13;
to an income group's distance from income equality.&#13;
Per capita demand growth for each commodity was projected for&#13;
every income class, both sectors, and the future time periods of interest&#13;
given the rate of redistribution and the derived per capita expenditure&#13;
growth rate. The future periods chosen were five year intervals beginning&#13;
in 1979/80 (to better coincide with the Plan period) and ending in&#13;
1999/2000. Rural and urban population growth factors were applied, the&#13;
income classes were aggregated, and the sectors combined, using&#13;
appropriate weights. Since demand growth is expressed as a multiplicative&#13;
increase, the outcome can be multiplied by grossing factors for&#13;
non-household demand (for foodgrains and edible oils) and by the base&#13;
levels of consumption. The result is final demand in quantity terms.&#13;
The adopted approach assumes that relative prices are constant&#13;
through time, and equal for all consumers within same sector, either rural&#13;
or urban. Non-household demand is neglected except for edible oils and&#13;
foodgrains. Proportionality assumptions are made to infer non-household&#13;
demand from household demand for these commodities. Individual household&#13;
data such as occupational category or educational level of the&#13;
head-of-household, caste/ethnic group, farm characteristics of farming&#13;
households, etc., were not available, although they can illuminate&#13;
consumption patterns. A final important assumption is that&#13;
real-expenditure growth per capita is equal in the rural and urban&#13;
sectors. This assumption at least holds in nominal terms since 1961.&#13;
(Evidence to this effect is presented in the model documentation paper.)&#13;
The programs in the model print out the expenditure elasticities,&#13;
the starting and ending Gini ratios, expenditure shares held by population&#13;
groups, projected demand for all commodities and time periods under the&#13;
redistribution and expenditure growth assumptions, and aggregate demand&#13;
for foodgrains and sweeteners.&#13;

II. ELASTICITIES AND PROJECTION RESULTS&#13;
A. Comparisons of Expenditure Elasticities. The expenditure&#13;
elasticities in this study satisfy the Engel aggregation condition for the&#13;
rural and urban sectors (Table 3): the sum of expenditure elas5icities&#13;
weighted by budget shares equals one. 1/ The' lowest adjusted R for the&#13;
underlying generalized least squares reg essions was around 0.95 and most&#13;
were 0.98 or above. However, the high R s are partly the consequence of&#13;
using observations grouped by income class. 2/ The elasticities for a&#13;
number of commodities are quite similar to previous estimates. Note, for&#13;
example, comparisons with estimates from the National Commission on&#13;
Agriculture (NCA) for pulses, meat/fish/eggs, sugar and khandsari,&#13;
beverages, clothing, milk and maize. 3/&#13;
Although the expenditure elasticities for wheat and rice are&#13;
higher than found by NCA, the estimates for foodgrains as a whole are&#13;
consistent with other research. Desai's estimates of the rural and urban&#13;
elasticities for foodgrains are 0.52 and 0.30 (not shown in Table 3) which,&#13;
are close to the present estimates of 0.63 and 0.39. 4/ Mellor's national&#13;
estimate is the same as the present urban figure.    The national estimate&#13;
of the expenditure elasticity for foodgrains is 0.59 in the present&#13;
study, 5/ whereas the middle of the range reported by Scandizzo and Bruce&#13;
for India is 0.60. The estimates they report use longitudinal data&#13;
1/ Meeting this condition is an attraction of using the&#13;
ratio-semilog-inverse form in which budget shares are dependent vari-&#13;
ables. The weighted expenditure elasticities equalled 1+ 0.001 in&#13;
each case.&#13;
2/ This is an additional reason why the correlation coefficient is not&#13;
particularly suited for choosing among functional forms even after&#13;
appropriate weighting and econometric techniques have been applied.&#13;
3/ The "Other" category in Table 3 includes fuel and light, footwear,&#13;
miscellaneous goods and services, rents, taxes, and durable goods. An&#13;
elasticity for this category must be estimated to check the Engel&#13;
aggregation condition. The projections for this category are&#13;
expressed in terms of a multiplicative increase over the base level.&#13;

through the mid to late sixties. I/ The similarity of estimates from&#13;
longitudinal data, cross-sectional data a decade earlier, and the current&#13;
analysis, (Desai--1963/64, current--1973/74) indicates stability in the&#13;
demand pattern for foodgrains and increases confidence in the projections.&#13;
Several factors motivated re-estimating the elasticities despite&#13;
their availability in other sources. Foremost among these is the fact&#13;
that the elasticities derived here and used in the projections vary&#13;
between expenditure classes, although they are only shown in Table 3 as&#13;
they appear after evaluation at the grand mean. Moreover, while many&#13;
functional forms have this property, the elasticities are usually forced&#13;
to vary in the same direction across income groups, regardless of the&#13;
commodity. The derivative of the elasticity with respect to income is&#13;
negative a priori for certain estimation forms. In the regressions&#13;
estimated in this study, the direction in which the elasticity changes&#13;
depends on the commodity. This variation was required.since future demand&#13;
for a given commodity was projected for each expenditure class, and&#13;
marginal propensities to consume generally are not constant across income&#13;
groups. Additional advantages of these estimates include more commodity&#13;
disaggregation, weighting by persons per household and households per&#13;
income group, and the consistency of Engel aggregation, as already&#13;
mentioned. Thus the similarity of some elasticities at the overall mean&#13;
to other estimates does not greatly detract from the fruitfulness of the&#13;
exercise.&#13;
Some of the notable features of this set of expenditure&#13;
elasticities are:&#13;
1) the urban and rural preference for wheat and pulses compared&#13;
with rice as total expenditure increases (a pattern supported&#13;
by NCA estimates); 2/&#13;
2) higher foodgrains elasticities in rural than in urban areas;&#13;
3) very low rural and negative urban elasticities for maize,&#13;
sorghum, and millet; and&#13;
4) high elasticities for clothing, milk, milk products, fruit and&#13;
nuts.&#13;
These relationships among the elasticities foreshadow certain&#13;
characteristics of the projections and sensitivity analysis, namely:&#13;
1/ See Footnote 4/, Table 3.&#13;
2/ This preference may have implications for the proportions of wheat&#13;
and rice the public sector should hold for distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
1) the increase in the proportion of wheat and pulses demanded out&#13;
of foodgrains if expenditure growth is rapid (Table 16);&#13;
2) the apparent dampening effect of faster urbanization on the&#13;
growth in foodgrains consumption (Table 14);&#13;
3) the somewhat reduced demand for coarse cereals given&#13;
accelerated economic growth; and&#13;
4) the sensitivity of projections for clothing, milk, and milk&#13;
products to expenditure growth rates.&#13;
B. Quantity Projections. The projections for two rates of&#13;
expenditure growth, assuming no income redistribution, are given in Tables&#13;
4A and 4B. The projections for various foodgrains and edible oils contain&#13;
grossing factors listed above (Table 2) for non-household demand.&#13;
Foodgrain demand would more than double by the end of the century under&#13;
the lower rate of growth, and increase by 220% if 5% expenditure growth&#13;
were experienced. 1/ Higher expenditure growth adds at least one percent&#13;
to the growth rate of demand for sweeteners, edible oils, wheat and pulses&#13;
through 1984/85 (Table 5). Although the growth in demand slackens&#13;
somewhat after 1984/85 for these commodities, rice, and all foodgrains, it&#13;
remains well above 3.0% for sugar/khandsari and edible oils even under the&#13;
lower alternative. Pressures, therefore, may persist either to continue&#13;
the importation of large volumes of edible oils, or to let prices rise&#13;
sufficiently to induce a substantial supply response.&#13;
1/ These increases are relative to the 1973-74 base year.&#13;

a/ The "Low" and "High" growth rates assume 3.5% and 5.0% total expenditure&#13;
growth, respectively.&#13;
The reasonableness of the projections can be examined through:&#13;
1) coinparisons with actual demand (availability) in 1979/80, which&#13;
is the first projection period;&#13;
2) comparisons with other quantity projections;&#13;
3) converting food demand to calories per capita and comparing&#13;
these figures with expected levels of consumption and other&#13;
calorie projections.&#13;
The actual availability of foodgrains for calendar year 1979 is&#13;
estimated to be 114.11 million tons (103.44 million tons cereals and 10.66&#13;
million tons pulses) which can be compared with the projection for fiscal&#13;
1979/80 of 119.46 million tons (108.1 million tons cereals, 11.36 million&#13;
tons pulses), which is about 5% higher. Foodgrain production in 1979/80&#13;
was 17% below the previous year's record level and availability in&#13;
calendar year 1980 was sharply reduced. The projections would therefore&#13;
further exceed availability if 1979 and 1980 were averaged. Nevertheless,&#13;
it is to be expected that the decline in incomes and upward pressure on&#13;
prices following a sharp decline in the production of foodgrains would&#13;
have dampened demand beneath its forecast level and this undoubtedly&#13;
explains part of the discrepancy.&#13;
&#13;

Household consumption of sweeteners, averaged for 1978/79 and&#13;
1979/80, was 13.1 million tons whereas the projection was 13.6 million&#13;
tons. 1/ The 1979/80 consumption of edible oils (including non-household&#13;
consumption) was estimated to be 3.55 million tons compared with a&#13;
projection of 3.36 million tons. 2/ The projections for these commodities&#13;
are fairly close to observed and estimated consumption, particularly if&#13;
allowances are made for the 1979/80 crop year.&#13;
Projections for the year 2000 by the National Commission on&#13;
Agriculture for rice, wheat, foodgrains, sugar and khandsari, edible oils&#13;
and meat/fish/eggs are very much in line with those in the present study&#13;
(Table 6). Estimates of demand in 1984/85 for rice from several sources&#13;
lie in a narrow range. The present projections for sugar also closely&#13;
match EPD's longitudinal estimates.&#13;
Converting food demand to calories per capita allows a&#13;
determination of whether the projected demand levels for all foods are&#13;
reasonable in comparison with the population projections. First, the&#13;
grossing factors were removed (since household consumption alone is&#13;
relevant here), then quantities were converted to foodgrain equivalents&#13;
with food energy weights, and finally the cross-commodity summation was&#13;
expressed in calories per capita per day (Table 7). 3/ The resulting&#13;
figure of 1,952 calories for 1973/74 is similar to estimates by NCA, The&#13;
Brookings Institution, FAO, and the World Bank in its World Development&#13;
Report. 4/ NCA's high projection for 2000 differs by only 22 calories per&#13;
capita per day from the present analysis, and the low projections are&#13;
eight calories apart. These differences are negligible in per capita&#13;
terms. This is a remarkable concurrence considering that different&#13;
consumption data, population projections, and methodologies were used.&#13;

3/ The food energy weights and conversion factors are reported in Appen-&#13;

4/ Some FAO base figures were adopted which makes this estimate less&#13;
independent of the present study, but differences in population,&#13;
foodgrains and some other crops remained which balanced out in terms&#13;
of calories per capita.&#13;

is similar to the high case here and in the NCA study. However, their&#13;
high projection appears to be-unrealistic.&#13;
Per capita food energy demand would increase by about 15% by year&#13;
2000 at a 3.5% expenditure growth rate. 1/ A moderate rate of expenditure&#13;
redistribution, i.e., a 0.5%/year drop in the Gini ratio, would leave the&#13;
mean level of food energy demand virtually unaltered. However, a gradual&#13;
increase in equality might have a more significant effect on the&#13;
distribution of consumption. The next section presents evidence that the&#13;
Gini ratio based on personal expenditures has actually been falling at&#13;
this rate. The sensitivity of the projections to various assumptions is&#13;
examined in Section IV.&#13;
In general, the projections in Tables 4A and 4B appear consistent&#13;
with actual consumption of some commodities in 1979/80. The projections&#13;
into the 1980's and 1990's accord well with other research on consumer&#13;
demand in India, expressed both in terms of quantities and in terms of&#13;
calories per capita.&#13;
III. INCOME REDISTRIBUTION&#13;
Since demand is projected for each expenditure class using unique&#13;
elasticities, income redistribution would alter the-aggregate. There are&#13;
a number of measures of income distribution available to summarize the&#13;
level of economic equality in a society: the Gini coefficient, Kuznets'&#13;
Index, Theil's Index, the Pareto coefficient, the equally distributed&#13;
equivalent, the coefficient of variation, and the standard deviation of&#13;
the log-normal distribution, to name a few. Atkinson presents an&#13;
interesting comparison of several of these.2/ Despite the ambiguities of&#13;
crossing Lorenz curves inherent in the Gini coefficient, it remains the&#13;
most widely recognized measure, and has been calculated frequently with&#13;
historical data which facilitates trend comparisons. Since changes in&#13;
income distribution affect the pattern of consumption, the projection&#13;
1/ It should be noted that the increase is moderated by the fact that&#13;
the average energy requirement per capita is also rising slightly.&#13;
As the population growth rate slows, the age structure of the popula-&#13;
tion matures, and the mean requirement rises.&#13;
2/ Anthony B. Atkinson "On the Measurement of Inequality", Journal of&#13;
Economic Theory, Vol. 2 (1970), pp. 244-257. Atkinson shows that the&#13;
ranking of countries according to inequality obtained from the Gini&#13;
ratio, the standard deviation of logarithms, and the coefficient of&#13;
variation are similar to the rankings found with the equally dis-&#13;
tributed equivalent measure using a different index of aversion to&#13;
inequality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

programs were designed to model assumptions about an altered distribution&#13;
and their impact on demand. Changes in the income distribution are&#13;
summarized in terms of the Gini coefficient and shares of the total&#13;
expenditures accounted for by given shares of the population.&#13;
Redistribution is assumed to be proportionate to a population group's&#13;
departure from economic equality. Crossing Lorenz curves (which may&#13;
present problems when countries are compared with one another) are not,&#13;
therefore, introduced. This section reviews an estimation procedure for&#13;
the Gini ratio, makes historical and international comparisons, and&#13;
reports the effects of redistribution on demand. The following section&#13;
expands on the issue of redistribution in a sensitivity analysis&#13;
framework, although the commodity focus is narrower.&#13;
A. Gini Ratio Estimation and Comparisons. Gini ratios lie in a&#13;
fairly tight band even when taken from a broad spectrum of countries.&#13;
Ratios from a selection of countries which are based on similar years and&#13;
population coverages are shown in Table 8. When countries are ordered by&#13;
the ratios, a clear inverse pattern emerges between the Gini coefficient&#13;
and the percent of income held by the least affluent 40% of the&#13;
population. However, exceptions to this generalization can be found.&#13;
Most of the estimates listed in the table rely on household income&#13;
data. Changes in the distribution of individual consumption expenditure&#13;
will obviously be related more closely to the demand pattern. Gini ratios&#13;
derived from these data will be lower since savings behavior is&#13;
disregarded. The Ranadive Gini ratio estimates for individual consumption&#13;
in India are, therefore, the most pertinent series for this analysis&#13;
(Table 9). They indicate an improvement in the distribution evidenced by&#13;
a 8.3% drop in the Gini ratio over 15 years. Ahmed's figures on Gini&#13;
coefficients derived from the personal income of individuals support this&#13;
trend. Some of the series calculated by other investigators are more&#13;
ambiguous in trend.&#13;

The national estimate is very close to the figure from Ranadive&#13;
(0.308) and indicates a continuation of the trend of increasing equality.&#13;
:Over .twenty years (1953/54 to 1973/74), the Gini ratio of individual&#13;
*expeniditure has fallen at an annually compounded rate of 0.55%. The&#13;
pattern is reinforced by observations of the ratio for intermediate&#13;
years. 1/&#13;
An improving distribution is at variance with cross-sectional&#13;
relationships between GDP per capita and the Gini ratio derived from total&#13;
,income (Figure 1). Countries at income levels similar to India's&#13;
experience more inequality as income rises. The reconciliation of the&#13;
longitudinal trend with the cross-sectional pattern probably lies in the&#13;
difference-between consumption expenditure and incom"e. The multi-country&#13;
study. was based on total income. The personal income distribution could&#13;
be worsening (suggested by Ojha and Bhatt, Table 9)r while the consumption&#13;
distribution improves. Some researchers, however, also show India's&#13;
income distribution becoming more egalitarian which would make India&#13;
somewhat unique when viewed against a background of cross-sectional&#13;
data.2/ Changes in expenditure shares and Gini coefficients for three&#13;
1/ However, Gini ratios for the more recent period 1977/78 were estimated&#13;
with the same technique using the decile distribution of private&#13;
consumption from the 32nd NSS Round reported in the Sixth Five Year&#13;
Plan, 1980-85. The rural, urban, and national ratios were 0.31, 0.34,&#13;
and 0.32, which would imply a reversal of the trend. However, these&#13;
estimates may not be comparable since it is not stated whether the&#13;
deciles are based on the household or the individual population dis-&#13;
tribution, and biases may have been introduced during interpolation to&#13;
deciles.&#13;
2/ A recent Bank paper on income distribution in India concludes there&#13;
has virtually been no trend. V. V. Bhanoji Rao, "EPD Income Distribu-&#13;
tion Project Data on Income Distribution in India," Division Working&#13;
Paper No. 1980-2, p. 19. However, Ahmend's figures show some improve-&#13;
ment through the mid-1960's.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
rates of change in the Gini ratio are presented in Table 11.    The middle&#13;
case, -0.5%/year, matches the historical movement. Somewhat over 2.0% of&#13;
the total income is transferred from the upper 15% of the income&#13;
distribution to the poorest 45% of the population by 2000 at this modest&#13;
rate. A faster decline in the Gini ratio, -1.0%/year, would approximately&#13;
double the size of the transfer.&#13;
B. The Effects of Income Redistribution on Demand Projections.&#13;
A more egalitarian income distribution would tend to reduce&#13;
demand for some preferred and luxury items, and expand the consumption of&#13;
basic. commodities, compared with a base case of an unaltered income&#13;
distribution. 1/ A falling Gini ratio for personal expenditures would&#13;
dampen the growth of demand for fruits and nuts, beverages, clothing, and&#13;
milk. The demand for fuel and light, footwear, miscellaneous goods and&#13;
services, rents and durable goods would also slacken freeing more revenue&#13;
in the economy for the increased consumption of other goods. Projections&#13;
for these items, however, are not reported since base-level quantities of&#13;
consumption for most of these categories were not available or&#13;
interpretable at a national level. 2/&#13;
The demand for clothing is affected more by redistribution than&#13;
the other commodities studied. Most of the effects of moderate&#13;
redistribution on consumption are relatively minor. Demand for foodgrains&#13;
would rise 1.0% and 1.8% by 1984/85 given the present and an accelerated&#13;
rate of improvement, respectively in the Gini ratio. The increase at the&#13;
turn of the century would be 2.3 and 4.0%, respectively. Since the Gini&#13;
ratio for personal consumption expenditures has actually been falling by&#13;
0.55% per year, the projection adjustments given in the left-hand columns&#13;
of Table 12 may prove applicable. The projection tables for a falling&#13;
Gini ratio, with 3.5% and 5.0% expenditure growth, appear in Appendix I.&#13;
A more detailed discussion of the sensitivity of demand to income&#13;
redistribution is contained in the following section.&#13;
1/ No distinction is made between income and expenditure for the purpose&#13;
of this discussion.&#13;
2/ Although projections are not given in quantity or value terms, they&#13;
are presented as multiplicative increases over the 1973-74 level.&#13;

The effects of redistribution actually reflect changes in the&#13;
marginal propensities to consume (MPC) at different income levels. Twenty&#13;
percent of additional income would be spent on clothing in rural areas at&#13;
160% the mean income level in the survey (MPC = 0.20) whereas only 6%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
would be allocated to clothing at 60% of the mean income level. 1/ Hence&#13;
redistribution significantly reduces the demand for clothing. The&#13;
corresponding high and low MPCs for gur and other sweetners are 0.01 and&#13;
0.03. This opposite ordering implies an elevated demand would accompany&#13;
redistribution. Likewise, in a neutral case in which demand was virtually&#13;
unaltered, the MPCs are similar across a range of incomes. The rural MPCs&#13;
for meat, fish and eggs at 160% and 60% of the mean income, for example,&#13;
are 0.027 and 0.034.&#13;
IV. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
Sensitivity analysis was performed on the projections for&#13;
foodgrains, edible oils, sweeteners, and the share of wheat in foodgrains&#13;
by varying the assumptions regarding population growth, urbanization,&#13;
expenditure growth, and income distribution. The proportions of rice and&#13;
pulses demanded out of total foodgrains were also considered. The&#13;
population parameters were altered in a few discrete cases, but&#13;
sensitivity analysis for expenditure growth and income distribution&#13;
proceeded from a set of 27 projections with a blend of assumptions.&#13;
Regressions were then run treating the set of demand levels as&#13;
observations on a dependent variable. This approach yielded elasticities&#13;
of future demand with respect to rates of expenditure growth and&#13;
"income" 2/ redistribution. In most cases, sensitivity analysis was&#13;
referenced to the projected demand in the year 2000. 3/&#13;
A. Population Growth and Urbanization. Population growth rates&#13;
were varied by +0.1% and +0.05%, and urbanization by +1% of the total&#13;
population per five years. 4/ A very high rate of urbanization was also&#13;
tested in which the urban share was 2% higher than the base case per five&#13;
years of projection. 5/ The span of the assumptions used for sensitivity&#13;
1/ The income levels selected for the comparison were chosen arbitrarily.&#13;
The asymmetry of 60% versus 160% is intended to reflect some of the&#13;
skewness of the income distribution.&#13;
2/ Technically, expenditure redistribution is being modeled since data&#13;
savings behavior were not collected.&#13;
3/ The previous section discussed the effects of two rates of income&#13;
redistribution on the complete set of commodities.&#13;
4/ In the "plus" case, for example, the urban share of total population&#13;
would be 4.0% higher at the end of 20 years.&#13;

analysis is indicated in Table 13.   At the extremes, the total population&#13;
in year 2000 is varied by +2.6% and the urban share by -5% to +10%.&#13;
The projections for total foodgrains demand vary in almost the&#13;
same proportion as population. The composition of foodgrains demanded is&#13;
hardly affected by altered population growth rates. Demands for&#13;
sweeteners and edible oils are relatively insensitive to population&#13;
assumptions compared with demand for foodgrains. These results are rather&#13;
intuitive.&#13;
The effects of urbanization rates are more interesting.&#13;
Projections for total foodgrains, sweeteners, and edible oils are modified&#13;
more by a 5% change in the urban share of population than by a 2.6% change&#13;
in total population. Unfortunately, estimating the future urban share is&#13;
more difficult and uncertain than forecasting the total population. Rapid&#13;
urbanization lowers the growth in demand for foodgrains and sweeteners and&#13;
raises the growth in demand for edible oils. The proportion of wheat&#13;
demanded in total foodgrains would also increase somewhat, at the expense&#13;
of demand for coarse cereals. 1/&#13;
Overall, the projections for these commodities are fairly&#13;
insensitive to reasonable variations in population growth and urbanization&#13;
rates, which supports the approach of using one set of population&#13;
parameters for the primary presentation of results. 2/ Further testing&#13;
confirmed that the effects of changing the population and urban share&#13;
figures were independent and additive, and indicated that the compound&#13;
result could therefore be inferred from Table 14. For instance, if rapid&#13;
population growth coincided with faster than expected urbanization, the&#13;
impact on foodgrain demand would be offsetting, resulting in a -0.3%&#13;
change from the base case (+1.8% from population growth -2.1% from&#13;
1/ Caution must be used when interpreting the effects of urbanization&#13;
since abstracting the differences in demand patterns between urban and&#13;
rural consumers involves altered relative prices, subsistence consump-&#13;
tion opportunities, income, and commodity availability, all of which&#13;
affect the acquisition of new "tastes and preferences". In addition,&#13;
urbanization will have unexplored second round effects on patterns of&#13;
production and distribution, and on prices. To the extent that dif-&#13;
ferences in consumption are explained by differences in income, income&#13;
growth would have to be faster to allow for the acquisition of urban&#13;
migration. Yet for the purposes of sensitivity analysis, urbanization&#13;
and expenditure growth were varied independently.&#13;
2/ Therefore, complete sets of alternative projections were not reported&#13;
in which population parameters were varied simultaneously with expen-&#13;
diture growth rates. The number of cases under consideration was&#13;
thereby reduced.&#13;

urbanization). The effects of population pressure on arable land might&#13;
lead to the expectation that the rates of population growth and&#13;
urbanization would be positively related. The foodgrain projections are&#13;
satisfactorily robust with respect to popujlat-ion assumptions even if&#13;
trends have a reinforcing effect on demand. Reinforcement would occur if&#13;
population growth were accelerated and urbanization were retarded, or vice&#13;
versa.&#13;
Provisional census figures have recently been released reporting a&#13;
population of 683.8 million as of February 1981. 1/ The census implies a&#13;
higher-than-expected population growth rate of 2.2% over the seventies and&#13;
about 0.1% higher for the last half of the decade than used in the demand&#13;
projections. Revised population projections incorporating the census data&#13;
have not appeared yet, but it is unlikely that they will reflect a 0.1%&#13;
higher growth rate than earlier projections for the rest of the century.&#13;
However, if this more rapid trend continues, demand for foodgrains may be&#13;
1-2% higher (2-4 million tons) by 2000. 2/&#13;
B. Expenditure Growth and Income Redistribution. The projections&#13;
of foodgrain demand are sensitive to the expenditure growth assumptions.&#13;
The demand for wheat and pulses as a proportion of total foodgrains in&#13;
2000 rises by about one-half of a percent (say 2 million tons) per&#13;
one-half percent rise in the expenditure growth rate over the projection&#13;
period. This generalization approximately holds for a wide range of&#13;
growth rates extending from 2.5% to 6.0%. The proportion of rice in&#13;
foodgrain demand is more stable and only begins to drop at the higher&#13;
expenditure growth levels. These trends indicate that rapid economic&#13;
expansion in real terms would stimulate a marked shift in consumption&#13;
patterns in favor of wheat (Table 16) by the turn of the century.&#13;
Future demand for sweeteners and edible oils is more critically&#13;
influenced by expenditure assumptions than projected foodgrain consumption&#13;
(Table 15). The higher expenditure elasticities for these two less&#13;
essential foods are of course responsible for their sensitivity.&#13;

In order to study the interactions of income redistribution and&#13;
expenditure growth in more detail, a set of 27 projections was produced&#13;
using a grid of changes in the Gini ratio and expenditure growth rates. 1/&#13;
The projected levels of demand in 2000 were then regressed on these&#13;
parametric variables. The Gini variable was converted to a multiplier&#13;
over the time period to facilitate interpretation. For example, an&#13;
original income redistribution variable was -0.5 signifying a 0.5% per&#13;
year drop in the Gini ratio. The ratio is then 12.2% lower in the year&#13;
2000, so the value 0.878 was used in the regression. Expenditure growth&#13;
was left in percent per year terms. The elasticities are shown in&#13;
Table 17.&#13;
According to these elasticities, if expenditure growth were 20%&#13;
higher than the mean in the simulation (1.2 x 4.22% = 5%/year) foodgrain&#13;
demand would increase by about 4% (20% x 0.20 = 4%), relative to the mean&#13;
projection in the simulation set. This relationship is approximately&#13;
confirmed by projection runs at 5% expenditure growth and a fixed Gini&#13;
ratio.&#13;
Interpreting the elasticities of demand with respect to Gini&#13;
ratios is even more direct since the mean of the multiplicative variable&#13;
in the parametric set is nearly one. 2/ Thus a 10% decrease from the mean&#13;
in the regressions is in fact a 10% lower Gini ratio in year 2000. This&#13;
improved distribution would raise foodgrain consumption by about 1.8%.&#13;
The elasticities of projected demand with respect to modelling variables&#13;
1/ The previous section discussed the expenditure share implications of&#13;
changes in the Gini coefficient (Table 11).&#13;
2/ This is the rationale behind the change in the variable definition.&#13;
A multiplier of one of course corresponds to a zero percent change in&#13;

compress a volume of sensitivity analysis into a readily interpretable&#13;
form.&#13;
Referring to Table 17, it can be concluded that:&#13;
1) A percentage change in the Gini ratio over the entire period&#13;
would have an opposite and nearly equal effect on the demand for&#13;
foodgrains as a similar proportionate change in the annual expenditure&#13;
growth rate. (A 10% fall in the Gini ratio multiplier over the period&#13;
would have an effect similar to a 10% rise in the mean expenditure growth&#13;
rate from 4.2% to 4.6%: demand would increase by 2% in year 2000.)&#13;
2) The sensitivity of demand for foodgrains, wheat, I/&#13;
sweeteners, and edible oils is fairly similar with respect to&#13;
changes in the income distribution. (An improved distribution would boost&#13;
demand among the lower income groups for all items but would decrease&#13;
demand among upper income groups especially for commodities with high&#13;
marginal propensities to consume.)&#13;
3) The sensitivity of demand with respect to expenditure growth&#13;
rates, unlike the response to redistribution, varies greatly between&#13;
commodities, as expected.&#13;
Appendix III contains the "data" used in the elasticity calculations,&#13;
i.e., the set of parameter combinations and projection results.&#13;
Graphing isoquants of projected demand against expenditure growth&#13;
and altered Gini ratios is another approach to interpreting sensitivity&#13;
analysis (Figure 2). The slopes of the isoquants describe the relative&#13;
importance of the two modelling variables. The flatter the slope, the&#13;
less important economic growth is relative to income redistribution since&#13;
small changes in the Gini coefficient would offset larger changes in total&#13;
expenditure and leave demand unaltered. The isoquant map conveys results&#13;
from a large number of projection runs.&#13;
The Gini ratio change scale used in Figure 2 is matched against&#13;
annual change rates in Table 18. The discussion of historical rates of&#13;
redistribution in the previous section highlights a scale value of 0.88&#13;
(-0.5%/yr) as a likely possibility. Although severe redistribution of&#13;
income, improving or worsening, would have a decided effect on demand, the&#13;
probable range of outcomes is narrow. The expenditure growth rate&#13;
therefore remains the most critical and uncertain parameter in the&#13;
projection model.&#13;
l/ The demand for wheat would respond in a fashion similar to the demand&#13;
for foodgrains in view of the low elasticity of the percent of wheat&#13;
in the total.&#13;

V. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
The absence of prices is the most obvious and important limitation&#13;
to projections based on cross-sectional expenditure data. Relative prices&#13;
are necessarily assumed to be fixed, whereas they would respond to&#13;
changing consumption patterns, production levels, factor prices, trade&#13;
flows, and government policies in a number of areas.&#13;
Not only are relative prices assumed fixed over the projection&#13;
period, but prices between consumers in the survey should be the same for&#13;
expenditures to carry a constant quantity interpretation. One step in&#13;
overcoming this obstacle has been taken:   separate urban and rural&#13;
projections have been combined using quantity weights for some&#13;
commodities.&#13;
Key assumptions were that real per capita expenditure growth would&#13;
be equal in rural and urban areas, and that any income distribution which&#13;
did occur would follow a symmetric and proportional re-allocation rule in&#13;
both sectors.&#13;
Projections for 1979/80 for cereals, pulses, edible oils, and&#13;
sweeteners are comparable with actual consumption if some allowances are&#13;
made for the poor crop year. Demand in terms of calories per capita was&#13;
closely aligned with other base period estimates and future projections,&#13;
projections were fairly robust with respect to moderate variations in&#13;
population growth and income redistribution.&#13;
This study and projections by the National Commission of&#13;
Agriculture indicate a 15% increase in per capita calorie demand to 2300&#13;
calories per day by year 2000 under the low economic growth alternative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Foodgrain demand would grow by 2.6% through the mid-1980s, and then slow&#13;
to an average rate of 2.3%. The total increase in the last two decades of&#13;
the century would be 60-70% if real expenditure growth is 3.5-5.0% per&#13;
year.&#13;
The composition of foodgrains demanded would shift away from&#13;
maize, sorghum, and millet in favor of wheat and pulses. If foodgrain&#13;
demand grew by 60-70%, wheat demand would grow by 75-100%, and coarse&#13;
cereals by 33-16%. There would be less increase in demand for the less:&#13;
preferred grains if expenditure growth were more rapid. The proportion of&#13;
rice demanded in foodgrains would remain almost fixed at 43-44% under a&#13;
wide range of economic growth assumptions. At a 5% expenditure growth&#13;
rate, the proportion of wheat demanded would increase 5% by 2000, and the&#13;
share of coarse cereals would drop 7%. One percent of foodgrain demand&#13;
would be 2 million tons in 2000, so the shift would be considerable.&#13;
Faster urban migration would slightly dampen foodgrain demand, ceteris&#13;
paribus.&#13;
Demand for sugar/khandsari and edible oils is expected to be very&#13;
buoyant even given slow expenditure growth. In the case of edible oils,&#13;
this trend has strong implications for future prices and/or imports.&#13;
Improvement in the expenditure distribution would affect demand&#13;
according to differences in marginal propensities to consume at various,&#13;
income levels. These differences cannot be inferred from expenditure&#13;
elasticities at the mean. 1/ A continuation of the 0.5%/year drop in the&#13;
Gini ratio would contract demand (relative to the constant ratio case)&#13;
for fruits and nuts, beverages, clothing, milk and milk products by a few&#13;
percent and slightly expand demand for edible oils, gur, rice and wheat.&#13;
The predominant determinant of the projections and the primary&#13;
source of uncertainty, is the expenditure growth rate. Elasticities of&#13;
the projections with respect to the growth rate indicated that demand for&#13;
foodgrains, sweeteners and edible oils would respectively be 4, 2, and 0.5&#13;
million tons higher at the turn of the century for each half of a percent&#13;
increase in this critical parameter.&#13;
1/ The elasticities were one or above for edible oils, sugar/khandsari,&#13;
and milk/milk products, but redistribution had positive, neutral and&#13;
negative effects, respectively.&#13;

The data called in line 50 give urban and rural population and expend-&#13;
iture shares, RP, UP, RE, and UE. Cumulative shares have variables ending&#13;
in "S", and the total shares "TPS" and "TES" use weights given in lines 1100&#13;
and 1200. The rest of the syntax corresponds to the discussion in Section III,&#13;
given the following: (Note that lines 60-70 simply load zeros into vectors)&#13;
= ETA&#13;
= FRUITPI&#13;
a  = ln(COEFFICIENT(l))&#13;
O   = COEFFICIENT(2)&#13;
= COEFFICIENT(3)&#13;
The "GAMMA" in the program is the gamma function, not the gamma variable&#13;
used in the text.&#13;

1/ Calorie weights are relative to rice which has about 357 kcals/100 g.&#13;
Although there is some nutritional value in spices, beverages, and pan,&#13;
they were assumed to make a negligible contribution to the diet.&#13;
Source: FAO, Food Composition Tables for International Use, 1954.&#13;
Foodgrain equiValents can be found by replacing the grossing&#13;
factor vector in line 1380 of COMB.PROJ.PGM with these weights, with zeros&#13;
inserted for other items. (Grossing factors are, thereby, implicitly&#13;
assumed to be one since non-household demand is not included in estimates&#13;
of calories per capita.) Line 1470 is replaced by a vector of ones, and&#13;
the "Foodgrains" output can then be interpreted as rice equivalents in million&#13;
tons. Multiplication by 9780.82 and division by the population in millions&#13;
converts rice equivalents to calories per capita per day.&#13;

The Foodgrain Economy&#13;
Introduction, Summary and Conclusions. Foodgrains dominate&#13;
Indian agriculture in their share of the value of crop output, area&#13;
cultivated and area irrigated (see Table 1), and in their overriding&#13;
importance in Indian diets, particularly the diets of the poor.&#13;
Developments in the foodgrain economy during the 1970s have raised hopes&#13;
that a basic constraint limiting development in India -- domestic scarcity&#13;
of staple food -- may have eased. In the last half of the 1970s,&#13;
foodgrain production met domestic consumption, government stocks grew&#13;
large, small quantities of grain were exported, and foodgrain prices fell&#13;
relative to other prices in the economy. It is important to know whether&#13;
this situation is a temporary result of unusually good weather or whether&#13;
it is a lasting result of forces stimulating foodgrain production and&#13;
controlling demand growth.&#13;

demand for foodgrains for the next twenty years.1/ The historical data&#13;
reveal a convergence of the supply and demand lines in the last half of&#13;
the 1970s. The projections suggest the possibility of continued&#13;
self-sufficiency or even an emerging surplus in foodgrains in the future.&#13;
Nevertheless, bad weather in 1979/80 resulted in a drop of 23 million tons&#13;
or 17% from the record production of foodgrains achieved in 1978/79.&#13;
Through the judicious use of foodgrain stocks built up over the past&#13;
several years, the Government was able to contain the worst effects of the&#13;
drought -- preventing serious famine, moderating foodgrain price&#13;
increases, avoiding foodgrain imports, even managing to export a modest&#13;
amount of grain. As creditable as this achievement is, the drop in&#13;
production which made it necessary should serve as a reminder that the&#13;
balance between the supply and demand for foodgrain is still precarious.&#13;
While the performance of the recent past and the probable future trends&#13;
point to India's self-sufficiency and emerging export potential in&#13;
foodgrains, the balance remains delicate and a succession of poor monsoons&#13;
could still result in a need for foodgrain imports to maintain consumer&#13;
supplies or adequate buffer stocks.&#13;
In this.context, the decision to resume imports in 1981/82 to&#13;
rebuild stocks drawn down following the 1979 drought was a prudent measure&#13;
to avoid speculative price pressures. The weaknesses of the 1981 monsoon&#13;
made the need for imports even clearer. The resort to imports to maintain&#13;
foodgrain supplies indicates the Government's continued commitment to use&#13;
market mechanisms for this purpose rather than resorting to administrative&#13;
controls on foodgrain movement and compulsory procurement.&#13;
Changes in foodgrain prices will cause these projections to&#13;
vary. The projections in Graph 1 have been made for illustrative purposes&#13;
assuming prices remain essentially constant in real terms. In reality,&#13;
prices will operate on both the supply and demand side, shifting both to&#13;
offset persistent large imbalances. As can be seen in Graph 2, the real&#13;
prices of foodgrain have varied in the past. They rose in real terms from&#13;
the early 1960s (a period during which relative prices of agricultural&#13;
commodities were among the lowest since Independence) through the&#13;
unprecedented drought years early in 1967. They then fell in response to&#13;
the Green Revolution until the spate of bad weather and constrained&#13;
imports of the early 1970s, when they again began to rise. Good weather&#13;
beginning in 1975, along with a well-designed pricing policy backed up&#13;
with a large public stocks, initiated a fall in the real foodgrain price&#13;
1/ Apparent consumption is defined here as gross availability of&#13;
foodgrains in the economy -- gross production plus net imports less&#13;
changes in public stocks.&#13;

that has continued through 1980 despite bad weather and a short crop in&#13;
1979/80. The trend rate of decline of the real prices from 1968 through&#13;
1980 is 2.2% per annum.&#13;
A continuation of a low, and even falling, real price of&#13;
foodgrains is one option facing India. A lower real price has a&#13;
beneficial impact on equity of consumption, as foodgrains occupy a&#13;
dominant place in the consumption budget of the poorest families in India.&#13;
By the same token, lower prices will stimulate demand and dampen the&#13;
production increase so that the projected surplus would disappear.&#13;
Supply-Demand Balances. Historical trend rates of growth of&#13;
foodgrain production vary considerably from as low as 2% to as high as 3%,&#13;
depending on the time periods chosen for calculating the rates. Finding&#13;
rates as low as 2% is a result of including a very bad year at the end of&#13;
the period and rates as high as 3% is a result of including a very good&#13;
year at the end, as well as a bad year at the beginning. The supply lines&#13;
in Graph 1 are based on two alternative trend rates, 2.3% per annum and&#13;
2.7% per annum. The lower rate is slightly below that calculated over&#13;
the period 1967/68 through 1977/78, both fairly good years.l/ The high&#13;
rate is that calculated over 1949/50 through 1979/80, a period which&#13;
incorporates all of the information available. 2/&#13;
The demand projections presented in Graph I are taken from Jon&#13;
Hitchings' "Demand Projections for India", the first paper in this volume.&#13;
The method of projection and underlying assumptions are discussed in&#13;
detail there. The main difference between the low and high cases is the&#13;
assumed rate of growth of total consumption expenditure. The low case is&#13;
based on a 3.5% per annum growth, which is just below the historical&#13;
trend. The high case is based on a 5% per annum growth in total&#13;
consumption expenditure, a rate roughly consistent with the Sixth Plan&#13;
projections and achievable under stimulative economic policies.&#13;
1/ If production in 1978/79, a very good year, is added to the period of&#13;
calculation, the trend rate becomes 2.7% per annum. If production in&#13;
1979/80, a very bad year, is added, the trend rate drops to 2.1%. If&#13;
production in 1980/81 is taken to be 133 million tons and added, the&#13;
trend rate is again 2.3%.&#13;
2/ This is also the rate calculated for the period 1960/61 through&#13;
1978/79. If production for the year 1979/80 is added, the rate falls&#13;
to 2.6%. If production for 1980/81 (assumed to be 133 million tons)&#13;
is added, the rate remains 2.6%. This indicates that the sensitivity&#13;
in the rates to individual years falls as the period is lengthened.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 --&#13;
It should be noted that the high demand line probably is not&#13;
economically consistent with the low supply line. Foodgrain production is&#13;
such a large proportion of the value of agricultural output (c.60%) and&#13;
agriculture constitutes such a significant portion of value added in the&#13;
economy (c.40%) that to generate a 5% per annum growth in consumption&#13;
expenditure in practice depends on a fairly rapid growth in foodgrain&#13;
production. Slowly growing production of foodgrain dampens the rise in&#13;
total income, and consumption expenditure, in proportion to its weight in&#13;
value added. It also causes the price of India's main wage good (grain)&#13;
to rise, dampening demand and raising costs of producing other goods so&#13;
that overall growth is constrained. Moreover, foodgrain imports, when&#13;
needed, take priority over other imports necessary for sustained rapid&#13;
growth elsewhere in the economy. The Sixth Plan, which projects a 4.7%&#13;
per annum growth in consumption expenditure through 1984/85 and 5% per&#13;
annum from 1984/85 through 1994/95, projects foodgrain output to rise&#13;
between 3.1% and 3.7% through 1984/85 and between 2.9% and 3.5% from&#13;
1984/85 to 1994/95. These are the rates of growth for foodgrain&#13;
production internally consistent with the target rates of growth of&#13;
expenditure. While it is logically conceivable for the economy to grow&#13;
rapidly while foodgrain production lags, the history and structure of the&#13;
Indian economy make this unlikely. Consequently, the relevant supply line&#13;
to compare with the high demand line is. the high supply projection, as it&#13;
is probably not possible to reach the high demand line if production is as&#13;
low as on the low supply line.&#13;
Government Projections. Government supply projections are&#13;
higher than either of the trend lines discussed above (see Table 2). The&#13;
National Commission on Agriculture (NCA) and the Planning Commission both&#13;
project foodgrain production based on an analysis of projected land use,&#13;
irrigation availability, technological potential and fertilizer&#13;
consumption. In the cases of NCA supply projections, rough rules of thumb&#13;
were used to convert these factors into expected foodgrain production. 1/&#13;
The production targets from the Sixth Five Year Plan 2/ are based on the&#13;
production technology and inputs expected to be available during the Plan&#13;
period, although the Plan document is not explicit about the methods used&#13;
in the projections.&#13;
1/ In the NCA projections, one additional hectare of area under irriga-&#13;
tion is assumed to add 0.5 tons of foodgrain production and one addi-&#13;
tional ton of fertilizer applied to foodgrains is assumed to yield 10&#13;
additional tons of grain. (Report of the National Commission on&#13;
Agriculture, 1976, Part III, pp. 96-98.&#13;
2/ Sixth Five Year Plan, 1980-85, p. 25 and p. 119.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
The NCA supply projections assume little change in the total&#13;
area under foodgrains from the 1970/71 base period to the year 2000, but&#13;
the proportion of foodgrain area irrigated is assumed to rise from about&#13;
25% in 1970/71 to 42% by the year 2000. It is notable that while&#13;
virtually all of the projected increase is from an increase in average&#13;
yields rather than area, the yield increases are expected to be generated&#13;
primarily by applying increased inputs of water and fertilizer, rather&#13;
than by any substantial change in technology itself or any increased&#13;
efficiency in input use. The assumed rates of growth of fertilizer (7% to&#13;
8% per annum) and irrigation (1.5 million hectares per year) are well&#13;
below actual achievements in recent years. The two NCA projections differ&#13;
in assumed rates of growth of fertilizer consumption between 1970/71 and&#13;
1984/85, with the low path assuming a rate of growth of 7.2% and the high&#13;
path a rate of 10.2% per annum. For the entire 1970/71 to 2000 period,&#13;
the rate of growth of fertilizer consumption is projected to be 6.3% to 7%&#13;
per annum. Both of NCA's supply paths converge by the year 2000.&#13;
The Sixth Plan targets, while lower than the NCA projections,&#13;
are higher than past trends. The lower target of 149 million tons implies&#13;
a rate of growth of 3.1%. While such growth rates have been achieved in&#13;
past periods, as noted above such periods usually included a base year&#13;
well below trend or an end year well above trend. The links between&#13;
Government policies, programs and input supplies on the one hand and&#13;
output on the other are not explicit in the Plan document. The Plan&#13;
targets for agricultural input use are quite ambitious, with irrigated&#13;
area expected to rise an average of 2.7 million hectares per year,&#13;
fertilizer consumption to rise 12.9% per annum, gross cropped area to rise&#13;
10 million hectares and total area under high yielding varieties of&#13;
foodgrains to rise more than 20 million hectares. Other agricultural&#13;
support programs are expected to increase their coverage similarly.&#13;
The NCA demand projections are considerably higher than those of&#13;
Hitchings. The NCA projections are based on growth in consumption&#13;
expenditure at lower rates than Hitchings' (NCA high: 4.7% per annum&#13;
through 1980 and 3.5% per annum from 1980 through 2000; NCA low: 3.0% per&#13;
annum through 1980 and 2.8% per annum from 1980 through 2000).&#13;
Nevertheless, the projected quantities are higher due to a much higher&#13;
starting base and a much greater provision for animal feed than in&#13;
Hitchings' projections. The base year chosen for the NCA projections,&#13;
1971, had one of the highest per capita consumption levels in recent&#13;
times. Starting from that base the NCA projects demand in 1979/80 at 133&#13;
(low) to 140 million tons (high). Hitchings' projections used 1973/74 as&#13;
a base and project 1979/80 consumption at 120 million tons. Apparent&#13;
availability (gross production plus net imports minus change in stock) was&#13;
114 million tons in 1979/80, well below trend due to the drought. Actual&#13;
consumption no doubt was higher than 114 million tons, allowed by some&#13;
drawdown of private stocks. Although the extent of drawdown of private&#13;
stocks is not known, trend consumption cannot be much greater than the&#13;

trend of availability. Trend availability in 1979/80 would be the same as&#13;
trend production (125 million tons), given the lack of imports.&#13;
Consumption in 1979/80 will be below trend due to the fall in income.&#13;
Consequently, actual consumption in 1979/80 is likely to have been much&#13;
closer to Hitchings' projected 1979/80 base of 120 million tons than the&#13;
NCA's 133 to 140 million tons.&#13;
The NCA projections incorporate provision of foodgrain for&#13;
animal feeding, derived from an accelerated and modernized animal&#13;
development program contained in the NCA report, that grows to reach 20 to&#13;
25 million tons by the year 2000. World Bank estimates, based on animal&#13;
husbandry sector work, suggest animal feed requirements considerably lower&#13;
than this, perhaps less than half. The Hitchings demand estimates&#13;
presented here incorporate an allowance for seed, feed and waste of 12.5%&#13;
of gross production. The provision for animal feed from this is generally&#13;
placed at 5%, or 9.5 million tons and 10.2 million tons for the low and&#13;
high projections, respectively, by the year 2000. The NCA also makes a&#13;
slightly greater allowance for wastage, 4% (8 to 9 million tons by 2000)&#13;
than Hitchings' allowance of 2.5% (4.8 to 5.1 million tons).&#13;
In summary, it is unlikely that foodgrain consumption will reach&#13;
the levels projected by the National Commission on Agriculture. The Sixth&#13;
Plan's projection of demand for 1984/85 of 150 million tons is similarly&#13;
unlikely in light of Hitchings' demand analysis. Consumption is likely to&#13;
reach the levels projected under Hitchings' high demand alternative only&#13;
if growth of foodgrain production is also fairly high. The high supply&#13;
projection easily meets Hitchings' high demand projection, just as the low&#13;
supply projection covers his low demand projection. Government&#13;
projections of supply lie considerably above either of the supply&#13;
projections. Although the Government's demand projections also lie&#13;
considerably above Hitchings', they are probably even less plausible than&#13;
those for supply.&#13;
Implications. The projections suggest the real possibility of&#13;
India moving into a period of sustainable foodgrain self-sufficiency or&#13;
surplus. This outlook is substantially more optimistic than many past&#13;
projections. As a new conclusion, it deserves to be treated with caution&#13;
and interpreted with perspective. Foodgrain production will still depend&#13;
on the moonsoon and a failure of the monsoon could lead India to import&#13;
grain. As Graph 1 indicates, actual foodgrain production has fluctuated&#13;
significantly around the trend. In some years, weather conditions are&#13;
likely to make it necessary to draw down stocks and/or import, while in&#13;
years of good monsoons stocks are likely to be replenished and/or some&#13;
grain exported. The analysis contains new projections based on the&#13;
prospects for population growth, household expenditure patterns and&#13;
production which lead one to the optimistic conclusion as far as market&#13;
supply/demand balances are concerned. The optimism of this conclusion&#13;
should not translate into complacency about the prospects for eliminating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
poverty and undernutrition in India by the year 2000. The projections&#13;
imply rising per capita consumption of foodgrains, and this, together with&#13;
the possibility of falling real prices for foodgrains discussed below,&#13;
would have a beneficial impact on poverty and nutrition. But the&#13;
projected rise in per capita consumption would take place from a base&#13;
which is very low on average and pitifully low for the poorer segments&#13;
of the population. Nor should there be complacency that the projected&#13;
supply/demand balances will come about without continued efforts on the&#13;
supply side to develop the technological base, input supply system,&#13;
irrigation infrastructure and incentives needed for sustained production&#13;
growth and, on the demand side, to moderate the rate of growth of&#13;
population.&#13;
Foodgrain self-sufficiency or surplus, if it comes about, will&#13;
be an impressive achievement of a long standing goal of Indian economic&#13;
development. It indicates that India, by continuing its major efforts in&#13;
agriculture, may be in the desirable position of having a range of options&#13;
which were not available during the period when domestic foodgrain&#13;
supplies were inadequate. Among these options are the following:&#13;
(a) Increase Consumption. A slowly falling real price of&#13;
foodgrains would absorb a greater quantity of foodgrains in&#13;
household consumption and slow production growth, so that&#13;
the projected surpluses would not arise. The past several&#13;
years have already seen a modest decline in real foodgrain&#13;
prices and rise in per capita consumption, and the current&#13;
level of household foodgrain consumption is approximately&#13;
equal to a caloric-sufficient quantity, on average, for the&#13;
Indian population. With unequal distribution of this&#13;
consumption, this means undernutrition for lower income&#13;
groups. It is the lowest income groups, who spend the&#13;
greatest proportion of their income on foodgrains, for whom&#13;
lower real prices are the most important. Effects of lower&#13;
price on producer incentives are also important but so far&#13;
at least technical change has offset the decline in&#13;
producer prices and has kept profits sufficiently high to&#13;
encourage greater production.&#13;
(b) Exports of Foodgrains. The Bank projections are not&#13;
reliable enough to predict exports, which are a small&#13;
residual between two very large and fluctuating variables,&#13;
demand and supply. Nevertheless, the prospects of&#13;
foodgrain exports are real ones. The Sixth Plan projects&#13;
the export of 3 million tons of rice by 1984/85 which, on&#13;
the basis of the Bank projections, appears feasible from&#13;
the point of view of domestic supply, keeping in mind the&#13;
caveats concerning fluctuations in individual years. The&#13;
prices at which the Government procures foodgrains relative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
to world market prices become important in this regard.&#13;
Currently, Indian procurement and market prices for rice&#13;
are not higher than world market prices, and rice could be&#13;
exported without losses to the Government.&#13;
(c) Diversification in Agriculture. The demand projections&#13;
contained in the first section of the paper indicate the&#13;
demand for several other important agricultural commodities&#13;
will grow faster than for foodgrains (see Table 3). Most&#13;
farmers grow a variety of crops in which foodgrains are&#13;
dominant (Table 1). Changes in foodgrain production&#13;
technology or prices can increase the relative&#13;
profitability of foodgrains, causing farmers to plant a&#13;
greater proportion of their area to them. Alternatively,&#13;
farmers who see greater profit opportunities in other crops&#13;
can apply yield-increasing technology to meet their own&#13;
foodgrain needs on less area, thereby freeing land for&#13;
other crops. The introduction of shorter duration&#13;
varieties of foodgrains (especially paddy) gives farmers&#13;
greater opportunities for planting a second crop.&#13;
Relatively small shifts in foodgrain area can mean&#13;
substantial shifts in area and production of other crops.&#13;
For example, 1% of the foodgrain area is equivalent to 8%&#13;
of the oilseed area, 17% of the cotton area or 40% of the&#13;
sugarcane area. Thus management of foodgrain supply and&#13;
demand is of central importance for both foodgrains and for&#13;
most other agricultural commodities as well. Moreover, if&#13;
the foodgrain situation is under control, India's&#13;
substantial agricultural infrastructure, with its technical&#13;
(research and extension), physical (irrigation and other&#13;
investments), logistical (input supply and distribution)&#13;
and economic (pricing policy, procurement and distribution)&#13;
dimensions, has more flexibility to meet the needs of other&#13;
crops.&#13;

None of these options will be available to India without sustained&#13;
efforts to raise foodgrain yields. Any significant slackening of the rate&#13;
of growth of productivity would return the foodgrain.economy to its previous,&#13;
unhappy position of scarcity, fluctuating prices and large cereal imports.&#13;
Continued work on basic and adaptive research, seed development, irrigation&#13;
and extension will be required to fulfil the promise of an emerging&#13;
foodgrain self-sufficiency or surplus.&#13;

Introduction. Oilseeds constitute one of the most important groups&#13;
of agricultural commodities in India. Oilseeds (including cottonseed and&#13;
coconut) occupy about 15% of gross cropped area and contribute about 10% of&#13;
the value of output from agriculture. The oilseeds group contains a large&#13;
number of field crops: groundnut, rape and mustard, castor, sesame, linseed,&#13;
niger, safflower, sunflower, cottonseed and soyabean. In addition vegetable&#13;
oil is extracted from rice bran and a variety of tree crops: coconut, oil&#13;
palm and various forest seeds such as sal and neem. Vegetable oil is an item&#13;
of mass consumption in India and is the main source of the basic human require-&#13;
ment for essential fatty acids. Most vegetable oil is consumed directly as&#13;
food, although the demand for vegetable oil for soaps and paints is rising&#13;
more rapidly than for food purposes. A growing proportion of edible oil,&#13;
reaching about 17% in 1979, is consumed in the form of hydrogenated oil,&#13;
mainly in urban areas and northern parts of India. The remainder is consumed&#13;
as either unrefined or refined liquid oil. Total consumption of vegetable&#13;
oils of around 6 kg per capita is low compared with over 25 kg per capita in&#13;
developed countries and over 10 kg per capita for the world average.&#13;
Oilseeds and vegetable oils loom large in India's foreign trade.&#13;
India is a traditional exporter of oilseed cakes and meals, particularly&#13;
deoiled groundnut and cottonseed meals; of speciality oils such as castor and&#13;
linseed; and of handpicked, selected (1iPS) groundnuts. Recently, deoiled rice&#13;
bran has become a major export. During the period 1975/76 to 1978/79, exports&#13;
of oilseeds and their derivatives averaged over US$200 million per year, about&#13;
14% of all agricultural exports and 3% of all exports. Since 1976/77, imports&#13;
of vegetable oils have grown large, to 1 million tons or more per year with&#13;
import values of US$600-800 million through 1979/80. Next to petroleum vege-&#13;
table oils have been the largest item in the import bill, replacing cereals,&#13;
which had been the largest item of food imports up to 1975/76.&#13;
Almost half of all vegetable oil produced in India is derived from&#13;
groundnut (see Table 1). Groundnut is grown mainly as a rainfed crop in&#13;
semi-arid areas of western and southern India--particularly Gujarat, Tamil&#13;
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka--in the kharif (June to October) season.&#13;
About 11% of groundnut area and about 19% of groundnut produced is planted in&#13;
January and February and harvested in May (hot weather or summer groundnut).&#13;
Rape and mustard seed is the next largest source of oil. Rape/mustard is&#13;
grown in the rabi season (October to April) in the northern and eastern parts&#13;
of India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which alone accounts for more than&#13;
half of total area. Cotton is grown mainly in Gujarat, Punjab, Maharashtra&#13;
and Karnataka in the kharif season, mainly for cotton fiber and only secon-&#13;
darily for the seed. A lower proportion of cottonseed is crushed for oil than&#13;
other oilseeds as a higher proportion of the seed is fed directly to cattle.&#13;
Nevertheless an increasing proportion of cottonseed is being processed to&#13;
extract its oil. Coconut is a perennial crop grown in tropical coastal areas&#13;
of India, mainly in Kerala, which accounts for more than half of total coconut&#13;
production, followed by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Linseed is grown mainly in&#13;
Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Castor is grown mainly in&#13;
Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.&#13;

Supply Trends. The growth in production of oilseeds has tended&#13;
to slow over the last decade (see Table 2). Through the mid-1960s oilseeds&#13;
yields grew very little and almost all growth in production was due to growth&#13;
in area. Since then, the rate of growth of yields has improved, but not&#13;
enough to offset the much slower growth in area.&#13;

During the period 1967/68 to 1978/79, domestic production of vege-&#13;
table oil grew on average by 2.5% per annum, substantially faster than total&#13;
supply of oilseeds. This is due to several factors. An increasing proportion&#13;
of some oilseeds, mainly cottonseed, has been processed for oil. The intro-&#13;
duction of solvent extraction methods has meant an increasing proportion of&#13;
the oil in the seed has become available for use. Finally, there has been a&#13;
growing extraction of oil from sources other than those included in the above&#13;
definition of oilseeds. These other sources are minor oilseeds of tree origin&#13;
such as sal, neem and kusum, and rice bran.&#13;
Demand Conditions. Household,consumption data indicate that demand&#13;
for vegetable oils for food increases at roughly the same rate as income, pro-&#13;
viding relative prices are constant. The growth in consumption would be dam-&#13;
pened by a relative price rise since households would substitute other goods.&#13;
With per capita income growing at 1.5% per annum and population growing at 2%&#13;
per annum or more, growth in total demand would exceed 3.5% per annum, assum-&#13;
ing no relative price movements. However, from the early 1960s through the&#13;
mid-1970s, growth in demand of vegetable oils was, constrained by growth in&#13;
supply, which was lower than 3.5% per annum. Vegetable oil imports were insig-&#13;
nificant between 1960/61 and 1975/76, so fluctuations in domestic production&#13;
directly caused fluctuations in domestic supply and domestic prices. In years&#13;
of short harvests, prices rose rapidly to choke demand back to available supply.&#13;
Through the mid-1970s, there was a tendency for relative prices of vegetable&#13;
oils to rise, although the fluctuations were so wide as to obscure any strong&#13;
trend. These relationships can be seen in Graphs 1, 2 and 3.&#13;
Starting in 1976/77, large scale imports of edible oil allowed demand&#13;
to rise by more than domestic supply. Imports in the oil year (November to&#13;
October) of 1976/77 through 1979/80 were one million tons or more per year,&#13;
comprising one-fourth or more of domestic supply. Per capita availability&#13;
rose from an average of five kg for the period 1974 to 1976 to an average of&#13;
over six kg for period 1977 to 1980. These imports of vegetable oil kept the&#13;
vegetable oil prices from rising significantly relative to other commodities&#13;
despite low oilseed production during this period. Indeed some have argued&#13;
that the large scale import of vegetable oils had adversely affected the&#13;
production of oilseeds by keeping their prices low. The imports now also&#13;
contribute to India's very large trade deficit which must be reduced.&#13;
Supply-Demand Balance. Assuming stable relative vegetable oil&#13;
prices and based on past trends, World Bank projections of demand lie above&#13;
projections of supply for the foreseeable future (see Graph 3). The supply&#13;
projection is based on a simple extrapolation of past trends. DL, the low&#13;
demand projection, is based on a 3.5% per annum rate of growth in total expen-&#13;
diture. DH, the high demand projection, is based on a 5% per annum growth in&#13;
total expenditure. With either demand line the gap between supply and demand&#13;
becomes quite large. By 1990, filling the gap through imports would mean&#13;
spending between US$3-4 billion (6-8% of total imports) and absorbing between&#13;
8-10% of total projected world exports of vegetable oils. The alternative to&#13;
importing to fill the gap is to increase the rate of growth of domestic supply&#13;
and decrease the rate of growth of demand. Decreasing the rate of growth of&#13;
demand in a country with such low per capita consumption as in India would&#13;
not be desirable in itself but a consequence of pursuing other policies.&#13;

Supply Prospects. India has under-utilized potential for raising&#13;
domestic supply of vegetable oils. There is scope to increase the supply&#13;
of traditional oilseeds by increasing cropped area and by increasing yields&#13;
through use of better land, improved varieties, good seed, pest protection&#13;
and more effective cultural practices. There is also the possibility of&#13;
introducing new oilseeds, such as soyabean, that could contribute signifi-&#13;
cantly to India's oil supply. Improvements in the organization of oilseeds&#13;
processing can yield extra oil from under-utilized sources such as rice bran,&#13;
cottonseed and a variety of oilseed expeller cakes not yet processed in sol-&#13;
vent extraction plants. Finally, an increasing proportion of minor oilseeds&#13;
of tree origin, such as sal and neem can be collected and utilized for oil&#13;
extractions.&#13;
Oilseed Production. Although the rate of growth of cropped area&#13;
under oilseeds has been very low since 1969/70, it could be increased with&#13;
appropriate policies. Farmers in India shift their cropping patterns in&#13;
ways that reflect the relative profitability of crops. As the technology of&#13;
producing oilseeds has been fairly stagnant, prices farmers receive have been&#13;
particularly important in determining cropped area devoted to oilseeds. 1/&#13;
Despite the relatively slow improvement in oilseeds varieties there&#13;
is considerable scope to increase yields from their present levels. Yields in&#13;
India are generally much lower than in many other large countries (see Table&#13;
4). A fundamental reason for the low yields is that oilseeds are grown on&#13;
marginal lands without assured moisture. hence oilseeds compete with other&#13;
low-yielding crops, such as sorghum and millets, which can better withstand&#13;
moisture stress. On better quality and irrigated land oilseeds currently lose&#13;

rainfall, prices and time on area, production and yield of the five major&#13;

cropped was found to be very sensitive to the previous year's price,&#13;

out to other crops such as cotton, paddy and sugarcane. Only about 8% of&#13;
oilseed area is under irrigation. Irrigated summer groundnut yields are&#13;
virtually double those of rainfed kharif groundnut, 1,500 kg versus 800 kg&#13;
per hectare. The irrigated yield potential already realized on some farms&#13;
is 2,500 kg per hectare.&#13;

Improved varieties of some oilseeds exist in India but dramatic&#13;
gains in yields are not yet in sight. Improved groundnut varieties exist that&#13;
have the potential to yield perhaps 25% more than traditional varieties. Some&#13;
early maturing rape/mustard seed varieties exist that have encouraged farmers&#13;
to insert them in a crop rotation where they did not fit before. Hybrid coco-&#13;
nut trees have the potential to yield two or even three times as many nuts per&#13;
tree as traditionfal varieties. Coconut trees take six years or more to yield&#13;
nuts after planting. In the case of all of these crops supplies of the improved&#13;
seeds or hybrid seedlings are in short supply.&#13;
Significant yield increases are however possible through improved&#13;
cultural practices and disease and pest control. For example, in the case of&#13;
groundnut 20-30% yield increases are probably possible as a result of using&#13;
effective techniques to raise the plant population in the fields. Agricul-&#13;
turalists concerned with groundnut consider that, with a combination of good&#13;
quality improved seed and sound cultural practice, it is possible to raise&#13;
groundnut yields by 50%, from 800 kg to 1,200 kg per hectare as a practical&#13;
matter over large areas. Many states in India are improving the organization&#13;
of their extension services in ways that should enable progress in oilseed&#13;
production, along with other crops.&#13;
The Government has tried to introduce several non-traditional oil-&#13;
seeds in India. In the early 1970s the Government promoted the introduction&#13;
of both sunflower and soyabean in various areas of India. The growing of sun-&#13;
flower presented several problems, such as poor seed-filling and pest damage,&#13;
that have so far limited its spread, although researchers are optimistic that&#13;
solutions to the problems have been found. Results from introducing soyabean&#13;
have been more encouraging, as it found a place in the cropping pattern in&#13;
the hilly areas of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh in the kharif (June to&#13;
November) season. Area sown to soyabean has increased very rapidly since it&#13;
was first introduced and now is about half a million hectares. Yields are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
fairly low, about 800 kg per hectare and the oil yield per hectare is consi-&#13;
derably lower than groundnut or rape and mustard. However, much of it is now&#13;
grown in hilly areas which otherwise would lie fallow. Therefore, any increase&#13;
in such areas represents a net addition to India's oil supply.&#13;
Oilseed Processing. The growth in the production of vegetable oil&#13;
has exceeded growth in oilseed production because an increasing proportion&#13;
of oil potentially available has been extracted due to improvements in the&#13;
organization of oilseed processing. Animal-powered wooden village oil presses&#13;
have given way increasingly to electric-powered mechanical presses that are&#13;
able to expel a higher proportion of oil in the seed, although some oil is&#13;
still left in the oil cake. An increasing proportion of oil cake has been&#13;
processed in modern solvent extraction plants, which extract most of the&#13;
remaining oil left in the cake. Solvent extraction plants also are necessary&#13;
to extract oil from rice bran and other seeds which have a relatively low oil&#13;
content, such as soyabean, sal and other forest seeds. As the number of sol-&#13;
vent extraction plants has grown, an increasing proportion of the previously&#13;
under-utilized oil-bearing material has been processed for oil. There is&#13;
currently excess solvent extraction capacity in the aggregate, although most&#13;
of this capacity is concentrated in a few areas, such as Bombay.    Neverthe-&#13;
less, there is scope to increase the oil extraction of under-utilized sources&#13;
by changing certain policies and by further improving the organization of&#13;
processing.&#13;
One policy that restricts the solvent extraction of expeller oil&#13;
cake and rice bran is the restriction on the export of deoiled meals. Such&#13;
restrictions were placed on exports during years when domestic supplies were&#13;
short due to bad weather. The domestic market for deoiled meals in India is&#13;
limited by the extent of the market for compound feed, which is very small.&#13;
Most Indian farmers feed their animals a diet formulated of feedstuff--mainly&#13;
straw, stalks, cane and oil cakes--available in the village or nearby towns.&#13;
Farmers are said to prefer oil cakes to deoiled meals as feeds because they&#13;
feel their animals need the oil residual in the cake. In any case, a domestic&#13;
market has not developed for deoiled meal beyond the very small one provided&#13;
by compound feed manufacturers. After that market is satisfied, solvent&#13;
extraction of the oil in expeller oil cake occurs only when the deoiled meal&#13;
can be exported. Only then can a solvent extractor make a profit by buying&#13;
oil cake, solvent extracting the oil and selling the oil and meal.&#13;
The Government restricts the export of various oilseed products to&#13;
increase their domestic availability. Exports of groundnut, cottonseed and&#13;
rice bran deoiled meals are restricted, although not soyabean meal. This&#13;
increases domestic availability and reduces the domestic price of oil cakes.&#13;
The oil left in the cake is used by animals as a high grade source of calories&#13;
to produce milk, butter fat, eggs and poultry, expensive sources of fat when&#13;
compared with vegetable oil. The Government also restricts the export of hand-&#13;
picked, selected (HPS) groundnuts and linseed oil to increase the domestic&#13;
availability of vegetable oil. Paradoxically these restrictions actually&#13;
reduce India's vegetable oil supply.&#13;
Table 5 presents calculations of the net effect of the export of&#13;
oilseeds and their derivatives on domestic vegetable oil supply. The year&#13;
1976/77 is taken as it reflects a period when the export of oilseeds products&#13;
was relatively unrestricted and in fact when the exports of HPS groundnut,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
castor oil and linseed oil were much higher than they have been since. It&#13;
was also a record year for the export of groundnut meal and deoiled rice bran.&#13;
Exports of oilseeds reduce oil supply by the recoverable oil content of seeds&#13;
exported. Export of deoiled meals increases domestic oil supply by the amount&#13;
of oil recovered from expeller cake by the solvent extraction method. This&#13;
solvent extraction would not take place if the export market for the meal&#13;
did not exist. In 1976/77, the export,of oilseed products resulted in a net&#13;
addition to Indian vegetable oil supply as the extra oil produced due to the&#13;
solvent extraction to produce deoiled meals slightly exceeded the oil exported&#13;
in the form of seeds and oil. In addition, as indicated in the last column,&#13;
the export of oilseed products could finance many times the oil exported. At&#13;
1980 prices, the export of HPS groundnut could finance the import of ten times&#13;
the oil content of nuts exported.   The export of specialty oils, which are&#13;
considered inedible, could finance at least the same quantity of edible oils,&#13;
and usually more.&#13;
The easing of restrictions on exports of deoiled meals, expansion&#13;
of the market for compound feeds,and farmers' increased acceptance of deoiled&#13;
meals as animal feeds will increase the solvent extraction of vegetable oils&#13;
now left in the cakes. Other improvements in the organization of oilseed&#13;
processing also will lead to an increased proportion of the potentially&#13;
available vegetable oil being produced. Perhaps the most important of these&#13;
is in the organization of rice milling to increase the availability of rice&#13;
bran for oil extraction.&#13;
Rice bran contains up to 15% oil which is recoverable through sol-&#13;
vent extraction. In 1978/79 if all the potentially available rice bran oil&#13;
had been recovered in India it would have amounted to 590,000 tons of oil.&#13;
Recovery of a large portion of this is a long way off. Only about 12-15%&#13;
of the available oil is recovered at present. Much of the paddy in India is&#13;
still processed in hullers, which yield about two-thirds of paddy in the form&#13;
of rice and one-third in a mixture of hulls, bran, broken rice and foreign&#13;
matter. The hull/bran/brokens mixture is unsuitable for solvent extraction&#13;
mills, as the oil percentage is only about 5%. It is also unsuitable for&#13;
animal feed, given the high hull content. Paddy processed in huller-and-&#13;
sheller and modern rice mills, which first separate hulls from the unpolished&#13;
rice using rubber rollers, yields a high quality rice bran suitable for solvent&#13;
extraction. Modern mills have the added advantage of having a higher daily&#13;
outturn, which expedites the collection of bran for shipment to extraction&#13;
plants. One way to increase the production of rice bran oil is to encourage&#13;
an increased proportion of rice or rice bran to be processed in modern mills.&#13;
Several Government policies work against this, particularly the levy procure-&#13;
ment of rice from modern mills at below market price, which smaller rice&#13;
processors escape. At the moment, levy prices of rice are not far below&#13;
market prices in surplus areas but the continuation of the levy itself dis-&#13;
courages investment in modern rice mills.&#13;

Forest oilseeds such as sal, neem and mahua would hold some promise&#13;
for contributing to India's total supply of vegetable oil, if their collection&#13;
and processing were better organized. Altogether these naturally occurring&#13;
forest products could contribute an estimated one million tons of vegetable&#13;
oil if all the seeds were collected and their oil were extracted. Full&#13;
utilization probably will never be possible. So far less than 10% of this&#13;
potential has been realized (see Table 6). Two-thirds of the total poten-&#13;
tial lies with sal alone. Sal is also the seed experiencing the fastest&#13;
growth in oil extraction. It has a ready market within India as one of many&#13;
vegetable oils for soap production. However, it has a much higher-value use&#13;
as cocoa butter extender in the international market. The main constraint to&#13;
the production of sal seed oil is the collection of seeds. The seeds fall in&#13;
forested areas far from roads and organized labor; moreover, their collection&#13;
is not yet well organized.&#13;
Pricing Policy. A supportive pricing policy is an important element&#13;
of any effort to raise agricultural production. In the case of rice and wheat,&#13;
the Government has developed an effective pricing policy (along with the facil-&#13;
ities to implement it) which recently has succeeded in maintaining sufficient&#13;
incentives for farmers even in years of heavy production, while keeping real&#13;
prices to consumers fairly stable, even in years of greatly reduced production.&#13;
This has encouraged farmers to grow more wheat and rice while protecting low&#13;
income consumers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
The oilseed and vegetable oil economy would benefit similarly from&#13;
a judicious pricing policy. Oilseed prices fluctuate more widely than many&#13;
other crops because, as mainly rainfed crops, their production fluctuates&#13;
more. Although vegetable oils take up a much smaller portion of the budgets&#13;
of consumers, particularly of low income consumers, than foodgrains, price&#13;
fluctuations in oilseeds are nevertheless disruptive and contribute to infla-&#13;
tion. The average levels around which prices fluctuate are also important in&#13;
their effect on production through the response of cropped area and on demand&#13;
management.&#13;

The Agricultural Prices Commission recommends support prices for&#13;
soyabean, sunflower and groundnut and the Government of India subsequently&#13;
adopts a set of support prices. however, an effective nationwide system to&#13;
maintain these support prices through procurement, storage aAd disposal does&#13;
not yet exist. The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation&#13;
(NAFED) has been appointed agent for the Government of India to procure&#13;
soyabean and sunflower as a price support operation. NAFED has been able to&#13;
accomplish this in the so far quite limited areas in which these two oilseeds&#13;
are grown. The price support for soyabean has been quite important in popu-&#13;
larizing the crop among farmers and NAFED has purchased significant propor-&#13;
tions of the crop in the first years after its introduction. NAFED is still&#13;
active in the soyabean markets. Outside of the soyabean area NAFED's procure-&#13;
ment organization is weak and needs to be strengthened.     There is no insti-&#13;
tution corresponding in size and reach to the Food Corporation of India to&#13;
procure groundnut in the many and widely spread areas in which it is grown.&#13;
The support price historically has been far enough below the harvest prices&#13;
in most areas to make the lack of procurement capability largely an academic&#13;
matter.&#13;
The Government needs to proceed with caution in further developing&#13;
its oilseed pricing policy. On the one hand there is a need to provide some&#13;
meaningful price support to guard farmers against sharp price falls when the&#13;
nation's oilseed crop is very large. In addition there is a need to provide&#13;
a guaranteed market at incentive prices in areas where the Government hopes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
to introduce a new crop. On the other hand the Government must be careful&#13;
not to set the price too high so that it is required suddenly to buy large&#13;
quantities in the face of a good harvest. There are two important considera-&#13;
tions to bear in mind at the present. The first is that weather conditions&#13;
for oilseeds production have been poor for the past two years and harvest&#13;
prices are higher than they otherwise would be, considering the edible oil&#13;
imports. A return to good weather should increase the crop and reduce harvest&#13;
prices. The second is that there is no tested system to procure, store and&#13;
subsequently dispose of oilseeds across India should the support price become&#13;
effective in a large number of markets. If the market prices fell below&#13;
the support prices at the moment, the Government would be hard pressed to&#13;
maintain the support price level.&#13;
These considerations argue for only gradual increases in the support&#13;
prices of oilseeds to the extent warranted by the desire to avoid price fluc-&#13;
tuation, while keeping close watch over market developments. Should market&#13;
prices approach the support prices in certain markets, the Government should&#13;
make adequate arrangements to procure some of the crop in those markets if&#13;
necessary. The Government's procurement agent, NAFED, for instance, would&#13;
need to be alert and responsive to these market conditions. If, over time,&#13;
certain areas became heavily and chronically surplus in a particular oilseed&#13;
and Government procurement were heavy, then a more permanent arrangement&#13;
for Government procurement would become necessary. However, it is not yet&#13;
necessary to build a nationwide system, such as the Food Corporation of India&#13;
has for foodgrains, for oilseeds. Some experience with the higher support&#13;
prices in good years and bad is first required.&#13;
The Government also affects the prices farmers receive by its import&#13;
and export policies for the crop. In the case of oilseeds, the effect of&#13;
Government trade policies has been important in the last several years. The&#13;
Government has imported large quantities of vegetable oil--one-quarter of&#13;
domestic supply for several years--and restricted the export of oilseed&#13;
products. The imported vegetable oil has been released to vanaspati manu-&#13;
facturers and through the fair price system at prices somewhat below those&#13;
prevailing in the market, although still above the even lower import prices.&#13;
These policies no doubt have kept domestic prices of vegetable oil and oil-&#13;
seeds lower than they would have been otherwise.&#13;
Nevertheless the prices of vegetable oils in India are currently&#13;
higher than those in international markets. Graph 4 compares the Bombay and&#13;
Rotterdam prices for groundnut oil, the oil for which the price differential&#13;
is least among oils common in India; for other oils, such as rape and mustard,&#13;
the Indian prices exceed international prices by a greater margin.&#13;
The prices of oilseeds and deoiled meals have been generally lower&#13;
in India than in international markets since 1974. The paradox of Indian&#13;
prices of oil being higher and of seeds and meals being lower than interna-&#13;
tional prices is, at least partially, explained by different demand patterns&#13;
for oilseed products. In India demand is relatively small for animal products,&#13;
and the protein meals and cakes used to feed animals, compared with that in&#13;
developed countries, and demand is therefore relatively greater for vegetable&#13;
oils for direct human consumption. The situation would seem to provide an&#13;
excellent opportunity for India to gain from an increased trade in oilseed&#13;
products, selling more seeds and meals while importing oil, if necessary.&#13;

Allowing more exports of seeds and meals would tend to strengthen oilseed&#13;
prices, calling forth more production. As this would result in more produc-&#13;
tion of vegetable oil, it would be a way of increasing oilseed prices while&#13;
easing vegetable oil prices. Whether or not the vegetable oil prices would&#13;
end up below the level that would have prevailed without the increased exports&#13;
would depend on the level of vegetable oil imports. Even if total oil avail-&#13;
ability did not increase, there would be foreign exchange savings from the&#13;
reduced level of oil imports.&#13;
If imports of vegetable oils of the magnitude discussed earlier are&#13;
to be avoided, prices will have to rise to encourage increased production and&#13;
to dampen demand growth. However, this prospect raises the perplexing ques-&#13;
tion of at what cost are imports to be avoided. Table 7 presents Indian and&#13;
world market prices of selected vegetable oils. It is clear vegetable oils,&#13;
such as soyabean and palm oil, are available on the world market at consider-&#13;
ably lower prices than current market prices in India. World market prices of&#13;
these oils are projected to rise only slightly in real terms over the foresee-&#13;
able future. This suggests that if it is not possible to significantly reduce&#13;
the costs of production of oilseeds and vegetable oils in the long run by&#13;
improved productivity, India would be better off in relying on more imports&#13;
for supplying domestic demand. This situation simply underlines the need to&#13;
bring about the increased productivity that is possible by raising oilseed&#13;
yields.&#13;

Medium-Term Management of the Vegetable Oil Economy and the Plan.&#13;
Expanding the domestic production of oilseeds and supply of vegetable oils by&#13;
the appropriate set of policies and programs is a longer-term solution which&#13;
will take some time to show results. In the meantime India faces an existing&#13;
supply-demand gap, the closing of which is currently absorbing an unduly large&#13;
amount of India's dwindling foreign exchange reserves. The broad outlines of&#13;
the medium-term strategy have been clarified somewhat by the Sixth Plan and&#13;
by Government indications on the vegetable oil import strategy. Briefly&#13;
the strategy can be characterized as one of taking such measures as are&#13;
possible both to increase vegetable oil supply in the short- and medium-term&#13;
and to progressively limit vegetable oil imports. The Plan adopts the objec-&#13;
tive of complete self-sufficiency in vegetable oils by 1984/85. This will be&#13;
difficult to achieve and some price rises in vegetable oils no doubt will be&#13;
necessary to close what remains of the supply-demand gap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
The main thrusts in the Sixth Plan to increase oilseed production&#13;
through 1984/85 are to increase the area under groundnut in irrigated areas in&#13;
the summer season (January to May) and to increase area under soyabeans. The&#13;
Plan anticipates an increase in summer groundnut cropped area from 800,000&#13;
hectares in 1979/80 to 1.4 million hectares by 1984/85. It also expects&#13;
yields to increase from an average of 2 tons per hectare of groundnut in the&#13;
shell to 2.5 tons per hectare. This would increase summer groundnut produc-&#13;
tion from 1.6 million tons to 3.5 million tons - an increase of 119%. Area&#13;
under soyabean is expected to increase from about 430,000 hectares in 1979/80&#13;
to 1.1 million hectares by 1984/85. Yields are expected to increase from 0.8&#13;
tons to 1 ton per hectare. This is an increase from 0.4 million tons to 1.0&#13;
million tons of soyabean, or 225%. Yields of kharif groundnut are expected&#13;
to rise as well. Some oilseeds, such as castor, linseed and nigerseed, are&#13;
expected to increase in production only modestly. Overall production of oil-&#13;
seeds is expected to grow by 5% per annum over the five years of the Plan.&#13;
These are quite optimistic projections. The trend rate of growth of&#13;
oilseeds production was only 1.6% per annum over the period 1967/68 to 1978/79.&#13;
There have been efforts in the past to promote summer groundnut cultivation&#13;
in selected irrigated areas but these have met with only limited success.&#13;
In these areas groundnut must compete with paddy, which is a profitable crop&#13;
in which farmers are well experienced and which benefits from a program of&#13;
Government support including an assured, incentive price through Government&#13;
procurement operations. Summer groundnut also must fit into an irrigation&#13;
system that up to now handles mainly paddy. This is impossible where paddy is&#13;
irrigated by field-to-field irrigation, because groundnut plants would drown&#13;
under so much water. Only where water is distributed by channels is groundnut&#13;
growing possible. Water releases in the rabi season are generally regulated&#13;
to suit paddy, although adjustments to suit groundnut are sometimes possible.&#13;
The Government intends to localize parts of canal commands for groundnut&#13;
(i.e., delineate areas in which farmers are supposed to grow groundnut) and&#13;
release water to these areas on a schedule suitable for groundnut. The&#13;
Government has localized areas in the past for dry crops without complete&#13;
success. The fact that farmers in many areas pay only token amounts for&#13;
rights to irrigation (and nothing for using extra water) further enhances the&#13;
relative profitability of paddy, which requires far more water than irrigated&#13;
groundnut. The increase in soyabean area has been quite rapid since its&#13;
introduction. The expected increase, although quite large, may be possible,&#13;
depending on the availability of suitable, otherwise fallow areas in Madhya&#13;
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.&#13;
Pricing policy will be quite important in this effort. While it is&#13;
very difficult to force a farmer to grow a crop which he does not want to, it&#13;
is equally difficult to stop him growing it when it is more profitable than&#13;
competing ones. Maintaining special procurement mechanisms for soyabean and&#13;
offering an incentive price were important parts of the strategy to encourage&#13;
the introduction of soyabean. Perhaps a special arrangement to procure ground-&#13;
nut at incentive prices in the summer season in selected irrigated areas would&#13;
be helpful in encouraging farmers to adopt groundnut cropping. This would have&#13;
its main value as a temporary measure while private marketing channels have a&#13;
chance to develop. Another policy measure that should be taken is to remove&#13;
restrictions on the export of oilseed products. Removing restrictions on the&#13;
export of deoiled rice bran and solvent extracted oilseed meals has the dual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
benefit of raising domestic availability of vegetable oil and increasing&#13;
foreign exchange earnings. These benefits would outweigh the burden of the&#13;
somewhat higher cost of animal feeding within India. Removing the restrictions&#13;
on the export of HPS groundnut and speciality oils increases the foreign&#13;
exchange earnings by more than the increased import cost of replacing the oil&#13;
exported.&#13;
Short-term measures to increase the supply of oilseeds and vegetable&#13;
oils are only part of a program to manage the vegetable oil economy. Some&#13;
policy with regard to imports is also required. A policy progressively reduc-&#13;
ing the volume of imports in consideration of the balance of payments situation&#13;
can be expected. It is clear that a complete elimination of oil imports, which&#13;
now supply one-fourth of total availability, before domestic production picks&#13;
up would raise prices precipitously. Nevertheless some curtailment combined&#13;
with increases in domestic production and some increase in price to further&#13;
stimulate production and dampen demand do seem necessary.&#13;
Table 8 presents a supply-demand projection through 1984/85 that&#13;
incorporates increased domestic supply along the lines expected in the Plan&#13;
and alternative demand projections that are dampened by a mild price rise&#13;
and volume imports that either remain constant or decline slightly, depending&#13;
on the growth of total expenditure. Total supply of vegetable oils is pro-&#13;
jected to rise by the Plan's 5% target growth rate for oilseed production.&#13;
Demand projections presented earlier are dampened by a 1% per annum rise in&#13;
the relative price of vegetable oils. The high demand projection is related&#13;
to a 5% growth rate in total income while the low projection is related to a&#13;
3.5% annual increase, which is approximately equal to the historical trend.&#13;
Under the high demand alternative the continuation of 1 million tons of&#13;
vegetable oil imports would close the remaining gap. Under the low demand&#13;
alternative, the-volume of imports would decline to 700,000 tons by 1984/85.&#13;
Imports could decline further if higher price rises were projected.&#13;
These projections contain many uncertainties and are useful mainly&#13;
for illustrative purposes. The supply projections may well prove optimistic,&#13;
given past rates of growth. Nevertheless the projections in Table 8 suggest&#13;
that reducing imports below their current level of 1 million tons may well&#13;
result in rises in vegetable oil prices higher than the overall rate of&#13;
inflation. Such price rises are probably desirable to stimulate production&#13;
and dampen demand and should be considered as corrective in nature rather&#13;
than unfortunate. In any case they may be necessary to manage India's&#13;
deteriorating balance of payments situation.&#13;

THE SUGAR ECONOMY&#13;
1.        The Role and Scope of the Sugar Economy.    India is the world's lar-&#13;
gest producer of sugarcane. Although sugarcane covers only 1.8% of India's&#13;
gross cultivated area, it is one of the most important non-foodgrain crops,&#13;
for it contributes about 6.3% of the gross value of agricultural output, about&#13;
3.5 times as much per hectare as the average of all other crops. About 80% of&#13;
the sugarcane area is irrigated which is equivalent to about 5.6% of India's&#13;
total irrigated area. Fertilizer used on cane was about 84 kg of nutrients&#13;
per hectare in 1975/76, about four times the average for all crops. While&#13;
sugarcane is grown in nearly every state, its greatest concentrations are in&#13;
U.P. and Maharashtra where 45% and 14%,, respectively, of India's cane is pro-&#13;
duced. Sugarcane is cultivated by about 25% of India's 80 million farmers, on&#13;
farms of all sizes, though the proportion of area devoted to cane is somewhat&#13;
higher on the smaller farms.&#13;
2.         Sugarcane processing, including the production of mill sugar, khand-&#13;
sari and gur, is a major industry. It employs nearly 8% of all manufacturing&#13;
workers and about 3.6% of the capital invested in manufacturing to produce&#13;
about 2% of the total value added in manufacturing. Throughout the two decades&#13;
before 1980, India has been an exporter of sugar, but exports were generally&#13;
low before 1974/75, when they rose rapidly, peaking at levels of over 1 million&#13;
tons in 1975/76, providing 12% of India's foreign exchange earnings. Since&#13;
then exports have been much lower and highly volatile. In 1980, India is&#13;
likely to be a net importer of sugar. Sugar is a large item of personal con-&#13;
sumption accounting for about 5% of private consumption expenditures. The&#13;
7.7% weight of sugar products in the wholesale price index suggests its sensi-&#13;
tive role. In 1979/80, the rise in the prices of sugar products alone accounted&#13;
for about 30% of the entire 20% rise in the wholesale price index of all com-&#13;
modities. Rising prices of sugar thus provoke sharp consumer reactions and&#13;
give rise to considerable political controversy. The high volatility of output&#13;
and prices which often characterizes the sugar economy in India (and other coun-&#13;
tries as well) is thus a matter of serious concern. The underlying importance&#13;
and visibility of the sugar economy have led to extensive and varied Government&#13;
interventions in its operations.&#13;
3.        Market Structure and Public Policies.    Virtually all sugar products&#13;
in India are based on sugarcane. The structure of the market for sugarcane&#13;
and its products and the network of public policies governing sugar production&#13;
strongly influence the performance of the sugar economy. In contrast with&#13;
many countries, sugarcane is not grown in large blocks on plantations as a&#13;
monocrop, but rather in relatively small patches forming a part of the crop-&#13;
ping pattern of millions of individual farmers. Thus cane production is&#13;
scattered rather widely among vast numbers of independent farmers who grow a&#13;
range of other crops. Sugarcane production is highly seasonal with the bulk&#13;
of the crop in most areas harvested in the December-March period. The sugar&#13;
content of cane in most areas drops sharply with the onset of warmer weather.&#13;
The sugar content and weight of cane drop rapidly after harvesting, making it&#13;
necessary to process the cane as soon as possible, usually within two days of&#13;
cutting. The production of sugar products is thus also highly seasonal with&#13;
70% of sugar being produced between December and March. Cane is a relatively&#13;
long-duration crop, standing in the field 9 to 18 months between planting and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
harvesting. It is a common practice to allow a second or ratoon crop of cane&#13;
to grow from the stubble of a harvested field. Thus there is a considerable&#13;
time lag between the decision to plant an area under cane and the full effect&#13;
of that decision on the supply of cane.&#13;
4.        An estimated 11-12% of the cane crop is used for seed, animal feed&#13;
and direct human consumption, or disappears as post-harvest loss. On average,&#13;
about 46% of the crop is used to produce gur, which consists of condensed and&#13;
solidified cane juice produced with very simple equipment in rural areas,&#13;
often by farmers themselves. Gur typically weighs about 10% of the weight of&#13;
the cane used to produce it and contains about 60-65% sucrose. It is by far&#13;
the most important sweetener, particularly for the rural population and for&#13;
low income consumers. Gur's weight in the wholesale price index is more&#13;
than twice that of sugar and nearly ten times that of khandsari, yet it has&#13;
attracted the least direct public intervention, a pragmatic recognition that&#13;
efforts to control such large numbers of tiny scattered units would be imprac-&#13;
tical. About 8-9% of the cane crop is used for khandsari, a white crystal&#13;
sweetener similar to mill sugar but produced through a smaller-scale, less&#13;
technically efficient process. The quality of khandsari is generally consi-&#13;
dered inferior to mill sugar and this is reflected in the 15-20% price dif-&#13;
ferential between the two products. An average of about 34% of cane crop is&#13;
used by large-scale sugar mills to produce sugar, often referred to as "mill&#13;
sugar" to distinguish it from other sweeteners. Sugar mills are much larger&#13;
in scale than khandsari units (the average sugar mill produces about 20,000&#13;
tons of sugar a year while a large khandsari unit produces about 750 tons),&#13;
and more efficient physically, extracting 9.5-10.5% of the weight of cane as&#13;
sugar compared with 6-7% for khandsari units.&#13;
5.        Gur and khandsari units are virtually free from controls on the&#13;
prices they pay for their cane or the prices they charge for their products.&#13;
Gur production is not taxed and while khandsari is taxed, it is at much lower&#13;
effective rates than mill sugar (in 1977/78, excise tax revenues on khandsari&#13;
were Rs 93 per ton compared with Rs 466 per ton of sugar). Although the sugar&#13;
mills are neither the largest consumers of cane nor the major producers of&#13;
sweeteners, the importance of their product on the urban market, their size&#13;
and their manageably small numbers, have made them the main focus of govern-&#13;
ment intervention in the sugar economy. The primary instruments of government&#13;
control have been: (a) setting a minimum price for cane purchased by the&#13;
mills; (b) varying controls over the monthly releases; (c) requiring mills to&#13;
sell to the Government a fixed proportion of their production at a fixed&#13;
price, usually below the market price; and (d) imposition of excise taxes of&#13;
varying levels and partial excise tax rebates. The blend of these various&#13;
policies has changed significantly at least ten times since 1960/61 and many&#13;
more times than that if one counts changes in the formulae for calculating&#13;
the fixed sugar prices or excise taxes. The present policy, and the one which&#13;
was dominant through most of the 1970s, is partial control: minimum prices&#13;
which mills must pay for their cane are set by the Central Government and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
often augmented by State Governments; mills must sell the bulk of their pro-&#13;
duction (usually and at present 65%) to the Government at fixed prices, 1/&#13;
while the remainder is sold in the free market, with the Government control-&#13;
ing the monthly releases of both levy and free market sugar. The levy sugar&#13;
is sold in government fair price shops at the same fixed price all over India,&#13;
with this retail price based on the average ex-factory price plus some&#13;
allowances for transportation and distribution.&#13;
6.        Short-Term Market Instability.   The aspects of market structure dis-&#13;
cussed above help explain the large fluctuations in the production of sugar-&#13;
cane and sugar products over the past several years. Variations in weather&#13;
combine with the lagged response of cane production to prices (see para 3&#13;
above) to produce oscillations in the production of cane. A short crop sends&#13;
prices up, but the full impact on production is felt only one to two years&#13;
later due to the long time between planting and harvesting, and the practice&#13;
of ratooning. These oscillations, however, are amplified by the controls on&#13;
sugar mills so that the fluctuations in sugar production are even more violent&#13;
than those in cane production. The reason for this is clear: in years of a&#13;
short crop, gur and khandsari producers are able to offer higher prices to far-&#13;
mers, and since the prices of gur and khandsari are not controlled, pass the&#13;
cost on to the consumers. Sugar manufacturers lack this flexibility since the&#13;
price of the bulk of their output is fixed and since their profit margins are&#13;
already under pressure due to high excise taxes. Consequently, in such years&#13;
farmers sell as much cane as they can to the gur and khandsari producers,&#13;
causing mill sugar production to fall proportionally more than cane production.&#13;
When the cane crop is large the reverse takes place. The cane price drops,&#13;
and the gur and khandsari units, unbound by the statutory minimum cane price,&#13;
pay as little as the market will bear. Since they are competitive, much of&#13;
the cane cost reduction is passed on to consumers. The mills, in contrast,&#13;
are bound to pay the statutory minimum price, so farmers clamor to sell as&#13;
much of their cane to the mills as possible. In such years the mills are&#13;
often obligated to extend the crushing season into unprofitable months and&#13;
to build up stocks which are a drain on profits. The relationship between&#13;
the size of the cane crop and the proportion of it that is crushed by sugar&#13;
mills emerges clearly in Graph 1. 2/ A measure of the instability in sugar&#13;
production generated by this set of policy instrumunts is that while the&#13;
standard deviation of cane production is only about 18% of its mean, for sugar&#13;
production it is 31% of its mean.&#13;
1/   These ex-factory selling prices for levy sugar are calculated separately&#13;
for each of 16 sugar zones, adding to the zone's average cane cost&#13;
(including cane purchase taxes if any) and the zone's average cost of&#13;
converting cane to sugar, a fixed return equal for all zones. In 1979/80&#13;
these prices ranged from Rs 2.44/kg in Gujarat to Rs 3.06 in South Bihar.&#13;
Rs 0.23/kg was calculated "return" for all zones.&#13;
2/   The asterisks in the graph are data points and the diagonal solid line&#13;
is an equation fitted to those points relating the total cane (TC) crop&#13;
(in million tons) to the percentage of cane sold to the mills, PMC. The&#13;
equation (PMC = 7.3 + 0.18TC) explains 84% of the variation in PMC. See&#13;
Annex.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
7.        Cane production rose very rapidly after 1974/75.    As expected,&#13;
prices of khandsari and gur began falling from 1975 and 1976, respectively,&#13;
reflecting the emergence of excess supplies of cane. This should have reduced&#13;
the average prices cane farmers received, but this signal was obscured by&#13;
two factors: farmers increased the proportion of cane sold to mills (since&#13;
the fixed statutory minimum price was much higher than the open market price&#13;
offered by gur and khandsari units), and reinforcing this, a number of state&#13;
governments required the mills to pay "state advised prices" which were sub-&#13;
stantially above the minimum. The results can be seen in Graph 2. Even&#13;
though the index of gur prices was falling after 1976, the index of average&#13;
realized cane prices 1/ fell only slightly in 1975/76 and rose to a then&#13;
record level in 1976/77. Thus, even though gur prices fell sharply in 1977,&#13;
farmers were encouraged by the cane price signals (and excellent weather in&#13;
the 1977 planting season) to plant a record area and achieve a record produc-&#13;
tion of 177 million tons in 1977/78. This was 16% higher than the 1976/77&#13;
crop of 153 million tons which itself had been substantially higher than any&#13;
previous crop. Naturally, with gur and khandsari prices already falling,&#13;
farmers made every effort to sell the greatest possible quantity of their&#13;
cane to the mills.&#13;
8.        Urged by State and Central Governments, the mills extended the crush-&#13;
ing season and produced 6.46 million tons of sugar in 1977/78--33% more than&#13;
the previous year, and about 16% above rated capacity. Despite this, farmers&#13;
average cane realization fell sharply because of the very low prices offered&#13;
by gur and khandsari units. In some areas farmers reported prices of about&#13;
Rs 40 per ton, while in others they were not able to sell their cane at all&#13;
either burning it or leaving it in the ground for next year. Even farmers&#13;
selling to mills did not get full payment because as the mills' stocks of&#13;
unsold cane peaked over the year to 4.6 million tons, many mills simply did&#13;
not have the funds to pay for the cane, despite obtaining large and costly&#13;
bank advances against these stocks. As this large sugar glut emerged, in&#13;
August 1978, the Government announced the complete decontrol of sugar. Sugar&#13;
prices dropped 18% over the next six months as many mills sought to liquidate&#13;
their stocks before the price dropped further. This was possible since the&#13;
Government had also lifted all restrictions on monthly sales. For a while,&#13;
sugar was sold at less than the levy price, and even substantially below cost.&#13;
In March 1979, the sugar industry introduced voluntary distribution controls&#13;
and by June 1979, the Government had reintroduced controls on releases followed&#13;
by full price control in September 1979. Due to low prices, internal consump-&#13;
tion of sugar in 1978/79 was a record 6.2 million tons, necessitating a large&#13;
drawdown in stocks, despite production of a near record 5.8 million tons of&#13;
sugar in that year. By the end of the 1979 season, stocks of sugar were down&#13;
to 2.05 million tons.&#13;
1/   Since the official wholesale price index reflects only the statutory&#13;
minimum price, an index of "average realized cane prices" was calculated&#13;
as an average of the gur price index at harvest time and the index based&#13;
on the statutory minimum price, weighted by the proportion of cane sold&#13;
to the mills. This index does not reflect the state advised prices or&#13;
the higher prices offered by cooperatives.   *Some states require mills&#13;
to pay 20%-30% higher than the statutory minimum. Where cooperatives&#13;
6perate, mill profits are normally passed on to grower members as higher&#13;
cane prices since agricultural income is not taxed. Both these factors&#13;
further distort the prices perceived by farmers.&#13;

9.        Meanwhile, the farmers reacted to the low 1978 cane prices by plant-&#13;
ing little new area to cane and relying mainly on a ratoon crop, bringing&#13;
cane production down to 156 million tons in 1978/79. This was still a large&#13;
crop, and with gur and khandsari prices still low, farmers sold a record&#13;
38.2% of their crop to the mills. Their average realizations, however, were&#13;
lower than in 1978. There were signs of gur prices beginning to rise but&#13;
these were not as clear as they might have been due to the unusually high&#13;
availability of unusually cheap mill sugar. The full impact of the effective&#13;
cane price reductions was felt at the time of planting the 1979/80 crop.&#13;
With little new planting the previous year, there was little scope for a&#13;
ratoon crop and little incentive for new planting. Weather conditions were&#13;
unfavorable. Area and yield both dropped sharply, resulting in a crop of 128&#13;
million tons, the lowest in seven years, and 38% below the 1977/78 record.&#13;
By harvest time, gur and khandsari prices had risen sharply, resulting in&#13;
only 30% of the crop being sold to the mills. Mill sugar production fell to&#13;
3.9 million tons, 40% below the 1977/78 record. During the year the full&#13;
price controls on sugar were lifted and partial controls (65% levy, 35% open&#13;
market) went into effect December 1979 and continue to date. From November&#13;
1979 through most of 1980, sugar prices rose at unprecedented rates and on&#13;
occasion sugar disappeared entirely from the open market. While sugar prices&#13;
rose by 52% between September 1979 and September 1980, gur prices rose 110%.&#13;
Although there was press speculation of unfair trade practices in the sugar&#13;
industry, the far more rapid and significant rise in gur and khandsari prices&#13;
--where trade is decentralized and competitive--suggests the real reason for&#13;
the price increase was a severe shortage of cane, a shortage brought on, para-&#13;
doxically, by the glut two years earlier. The rise in prices of sweeteners&#13;
alone accounts for 35.2% of the rise in the general wholesale price index&#13;
during that period.&#13;
10.       With cane prices high in the planting season for the 1980/81 crop,&#13;
cane production is expected to recover to about 155 million tons. Poor&#13;
weather conditions at planting time (February-March 1980) probably prevented&#13;
a more rapid recovery. With even higher statutory prices and high gur and&#13;
khandsari prices in the early months of 1981, 1/ one can expect the 1981/82&#13;
crop to be even larger--possibly on the order of the 1977/78 record.    The&#13;
following sections assess the longer-term supply and demand prospects. It&#13;
is worth noting, however, that the structural causes of the volatility in&#13;
the cane and sugar products markets remain. Without an appropriate balance&#13;
between the price of cane and its products and between the price of cane and&#13;
alternative crops, it is difficult to see how these wide oscillations can&#13;
be avoided. Ways of obtaining such balance are discussed below in the section&#13;
on policy implications.&#13;
11.       Long-Term Supply and Demand Trends.   The production of sugarcane&#13;
has grown significantly over the past two decades. As Table 1 indicates,&#13;
however, the aggregate growth trends have varied among regions and between&#13;
decades. Graph 3 shows very sharp year-to-year fluctuations around these&#13;
longer-term trends. Over the past twenty years as a whole, the rate of growth&#13;
of cane production has been 2.70% per annum. Over the last decade, it has&#13;
1/   The Government raised the statutory minimum price of cane by 25% in&#13;
1979/80 and by another 4% in 1980/81. The price index for gur in&#13;
December 1980 was about 50% higher than it was a year earlier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
accelerated to 3.78% per annum. The increase in the rate of growth, however,&#13;
has been due to an increase in the growth of area from 1.44% per annum to&#13;
2.75% per annum, while growth in yield has been somewhat lower in the past&#13;
10 years than for the 1960/61-1978/79 period as a whole. It is particularly&#13;
disturbing that yields have virtually stagnated in U.P. and the tropical&#13;
states other than Maharashtra, which together account for 70% of India's&#13;
cane production.&#13;

12.       The profitability of sugarcane cultivation has been a major force&#13;
behind its rapid growth. Farm management studies in the late 1960s and early&#13;
1970s show sugarcane earning two to five times more than most competing crop&#13;
combinations, more than enough to compensate for sugarcane's longer duration&#13;
(9-18 months). Notable technological advances in some alternative crops--&#13;
mainly foodgrains--and a gradual, although not statistically significant,&#13;
decline in cane prices relative to some competing crops, have tended to narrow&#13;
sugarcane's competitive edge somewhat.   Still, partial cost of cultivation and&#13;
crop budget data, combined with the continued strong growth in cane production&#13;
even during the green revolution period, indicate that sugarcane is substan-&#13;
tially more profitable than most other crop combinations in most years.&#13;
13.       There are striking regional differences in cane production trends.&#13;
Cane is grown in two broadly different zones--sub-tropical (predominately&#13;
UP) and tropical. Over the past two decades, production in the tropical&#13;
zone has grown more than twice as fast as in the sub-tropical zone. Growing&#13;
conditions in the tropical zone are technically superior for cane cultivation,&#13;
as Table 2 suggests. Cane growers in the south enjoy a longer productive&#13;
growing season giving more cane per unit of land and more sugar per unit of&#13;
cane. The apparent technical superiority of the tropical belt, however, does&#13;
not tell the whole story. Although available cost of cultivation data are&#13;
fragmentary, they suggest that the much higher costs of growing cane in the&#13;
tropical zone substantially offset the region's greater technical efficiency.&#13;
The duration of a significant portion of tropical zone cane crop is 12-18&#13;
months, versus 9-10 months in the sub-tropical zone. Much of the cane grown&#13;
in the sub-tropical zone is grown in relatively fertile soil requiring little&#13;
or no irrigation.&#13;

14.       This point is brought out in Table 3 which compares cost of pro-&#13;
duction and net return estimates for Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. In recent&#13;
years the cost of cultivation in Maharashtra has been about twice the U.P. level&#13;
so that net returns are not significantly different, given the inexact nature&#13;
of the data. To some extent the cost of production data may overstate the eco-&#13;
nomic production costs both because of the methodology used (e.g., labor valued&#13;
at market wages) and because those providing the data (the farmers) may know&#13;
they are used to justify increases in the minimum sugarcane price. On the&#13;
other hand, other costs, particularly water, may not be valued at their full&#13;
opportunity cost. This would further reduce Maharashtra's apparent comparative&#13;
advantage since the Maharashtra crop requires substantially more water because&#13;
of its longer duration and the soils and climate in which it is grown.&#13;

15.       As noted earlier, the longer-term growth in India's sugar production&#13;
is marked by sharp year-to-year fluctuations. Measures to reduce such insta-&#13;
bility are discussed below. Here an effort is made to discuss the level and&#13;
adequacy of the long-term growth rates. Graph 4 shows actual production&#13;
and domestic consumption of all sweeteners from 1960 to 1980 and alternative&#13;
projections of. production and domestic demand from 1980 to 2000. The three&#13;
production projections are based on extrapolations of: (a) the higher his-&#13;
torical growthrate (3.8%) in cane production experienced since 1967/68 (the&#13;
high production projection); (b) the lower growth rate (2.7%) experienced over&#13;
the period since 1960/61 (the low projection); and (c) an equation relating&#13;
cane production to a time trend and lagged cane prices relative to prices of&#13;
competing crops (the medium projection). The consumption projections are&#13;
based on: (a) an extrapolation of the historical growth rate in consumption&#13;
(2.44%) (the lowest projection); (b) estimates of per capita expenditure&#13;
elasticity of demand for sweeteners based on NSS cross-sectional survey data&#13;
and World Bank population projections assuming, alternatively, 5% and 3.5%&#13;
rates of growth in total expenditures; and (c) estimates of expenditure and&#13;
price elasticities for sweeteners derived from time series data, again assum-&#13;
ing 5% and 3.5% as alternative expenditure growth rates. 1/&#13;

16.        The projections suggest that if past growth rates in cane production&#13;
can be sustained, serious chronic shortages of sweeteners are not likely to&#13;
emerge. 1/ The projection of recent growth in cane production more than&#13;
covers even the highest demand scenario. The two highest demand projections&#13;
assume an unprecedented growth in expenditure of 5% per annum sustained over&#13;
20 years and may be assumed to represent the upper limit to likely demand.&#13;
Even if the highest demand projection is taken as given, cane prices would&#13;
need to rise relative to competing crops by only about 0.4% per annum above&#13;
present levels to bring the medium production projection into balance with&#13;
1/   It should be emphasized that this statement refers to average trends.         If&#13;
the wide fluctuations in production described above in paras 6 to 10&#13;
remain, there will be years of acute shortage (as well as years of excess&#13;
supply).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
this very high demand projection. 1/ If the lower expenditure growth assump-&#13;
tions are taken as more probable--and they certainly are more consistent with&#13;
historical behavior--then the situation would be even more comfortable.&#13;
17.       The tapering off of yield growth, particularly in the main cane pro-&#13;
ducing areas (para 13 above), is a cause for concern and raises the question&#13;
whether the future scope for expanding production is great enough to allow&#13;
past trends to continue. Nevertheless, even if sugarcane only maintains its&#13;
share of irrigated area (5.6%) and yields do not increase at all, the 13.6&#13;
million ha additional irrigation projected for the Sixth Plan would imply cane&#13;
production increases by 1984/85 greater than the highest production projection&#13;
on the graph. Moreover, an analysis of present cane yields and cultivation&#13;
practices suggests there is ample scope for further yield increases and/or&#13;
cost reducing innovations which would maintain the relative profitability of&#13;
cane production, stimulating both higher production per hectare and further&#13;
area growth as well. A range of fairly well-tested simple techniques are known&#13;
which would substantially increase yields of both newly planted and ratooned&#13;
cane. These include careful selection and treatment of planting material,&#13;
appropriate spacing, weeding, combined with moderate doses of fertilizer and,&#13;
for the ratoon crop, close shaving, trash burning and gap filling. When such&#13;
techniques were systematically adopted by farmers in Chambal, Rajasthan, an&#13;
area not specially suited for cane cultivation, yields rose over 45%. 2/&#13;
Research findings suggest substantial water savings can be obtained through&#13;
skip-furrow irrigation. While farmers who do not pay for water on a volumetric&#13;
basis may have little incentive to adopt this practice, many farmers who irri-&#13;
gate with private pumps can cut costs substantially. Research also indicates&#13;
that inter-cropping with such crops as oilseeds, potatoes and wheat gives&#13;
virtually a full yield of each crop and helps control weeds during the early&#13;
stages of cane growth. The joint profitability of the crops is substantially&#13;
enhanced. 3/ These and a number of other promising innovations have yet to be&#13;
widely adopted and adapted to farmers' field conditions.&#13;
18.       This suggests strongly that where a strong link can be established&#13;
between farmers, extension workers and research, cane yields and profits can&#13;
rise. Unfortunately, as the yield growth data suggest, in some areas this is&#13;
not happening. Research stations often have useful results on hand which have&#13;
not reached farmers. Yet some of the farmers' constraints are not fully&#13;
reflected in research stations, and a disproportionate research effort is&#13;
often devoted to topics (e.g., sugarbeet) which have little relevance to most&#13;
farm conditions. In some of the most important cane growing areas, the link&#13;
between extension agents, research and the farmers on technical matters is&#13;
very weak. There are good reasons for this as virtually all the time of&#13;
1/   Such a rise in cane prices would also tend to reduce demand implying that&#13;
an equilibrium would be reached without cane prices rising even that much.&#13;

special cane development staff is taken up in necessary administrative and&#13;
logistical matters (such as organizing cane deliveries). In one major cane&#13;
growing area none of the farmers interviewed had received technical advice on&#13;
improved techniques and varieties. Moreover, since cane is only one of many&#13;
crops grown by the farmers, an extension service focussing on cane alone is&#13;
not ideal for the job. Fortunately, most states in India are in the process&#13;
of reorganizing extension services to provide a strong channel for effective&#13;
technical advice to farmers and feedback to research. Such a reform should&#13;
strengthen the technical basis for growth not only of sugarcane but also for&#13;
all other crops. The Plan program for improving the technological base of&#13;
cane cultivation should be designed to reinforce these extension reforms&#13;
rather than strengthening special schemes dealing with cane alone. One way to&#13;
do this would be to use funds earmarked for centrally designed demonstrations&#13;
for field trials adapted to local conditions. Where the extension reforms are&#13;
operative in major cane areas, consideration could be given to adding a tech-&#13;
nical subject matter specialist in sugarcane to the subject matter specialists&#13;
already in place.&#13;
19.       Sugar Production and Export.   The present profitability and future&#13;
technical possibilities make it probable that sugarcane production can con-&#13;
tinue to grow at rates similar to those in the recent past. If so, cane pro-&#13;
duction can exceed domestic demand, offering export possibilities. To give an&#13;
approximate idea of the orders of magnitude of potential exports, the gaps&#13;
between two alternative production and demand scenarios are given in Table 4&#13;
These figures are not meant to indicate projections of actual exports---they&#13;
are simply not that precise. Moreover, the gap between supply and demand&#13;
on which they are based is not likely to be closed only by exports--some fall&#13;
in relative sugar prices and consequent increase in demand and slower supply&#13;
growth would also narrow the gap. As the projections are pushed further&#13;
into the future, the mix of developments which will bring about equilibrium&#13;
becomes increasingly speculative.&#13;

20.       The table does suggest that India's objective of bringing sugar&#13;
exports to a level of one million tons per year by 1985 is feasible in terms&#13;
of total balances of supply and demand for sweeteners. The high NSS demand&#13;
estimate, combined with the increasing proportion of sugar in total sweetener&#13;
consumption, suggest an upper limit to domestic demand for sugar of about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
6.8-6.9 million tons in 1985. This is consistent with the targeted increase&#13;
in installed sugar mill capacity to about 8.04 million tons by 1984/85. The&#13;
targeted investment of about Rs 8,050 million would increase total crushing&#13;
capacity by about 171,250 tons of cane per day, with about 60% of new capacity&#13;
to be from new plants and 40% from expansions of existing mills. While this&#13;
is higher than the 150,000 tpd capacity strictly needed to reach 8.04 million&#13;
ton production level, it is probably wise to allow for some slippage and cost&#13;
increase. Most of the investment is likely to be in the cooperative sector&#13;
since government policy offers cooperatives highly favorable financing terms.&#13;
If Plan resources are constrained, incentives to encourage a higher proportion&#13;
of private investment could be considered. Careful consideration should also&#13;
be given to increasing the proportion of expansions of existing plants in the&#13;
total increase in capacity. Expansions cost 40% less than new plants per ton&#13;
of capacity, and probably involve shorter gestation periods and fewer logis-&#13;
tical problems. The locations of new plants will have to be selected care-&#13;
fully to ensure adequate cane supplies. The reintroduction of incentives for&#13;
new mills and mill expansion 1/ combined with the recovery of sugar prices has&#13;
increased the attractiveness of investments in this sector substantially, but&#13;
the violent fluctuations in cane supplied to the mills will remain a major&#13;
disincentive unless remedial measures are taken.&#13;
21.       The volatility of sugar both in India and in the world market makes&#13;
it difficult to project the competitiveness and profitability of India's&#13;
sugar exports. Both Indian and world sugar markets appear cyclical and the&#13;
profitability of India's sugar exports depends on India's cycle being in or&#13;
out of phase with the world market. Prior to 1973/74 the unit value of&#13;
India's exports was generally below both domestic market prices and the&#13;
ex-factory levy prices. In 1974 and 1975 world market prices were high and&#13;
resulted in sharp increases in the volume and value of India's sugar exports.&#13;
Between 1976 and 1979 world prices were generally lower than Indian domestic&#13;
price but higher than ex-factory levy prices (which exclude excise taxes). In&#13;
1980 world sugar prices were high and are expected to remain well above Indian&#13;
production costs through 1981. Indian cane yields and sugar production costs&#13;
appear fairly competitive with other suppliers. From the Annual Survey of&#13;
Industries 1977/78 and from the calculations used to determine the ex-factory&#13;
levy price, Indian sugar production costs appeared to be about US$171-208 per&#13;
ton of D-29 sugar in 1977/78, a year when developing country sugar production&#13;
costs were estimated at US$220-310 per ton for raw sugar of lower quality. 2/&#13;
World market prices for raw sugar in 1985 are estimated at US$412 per ton in&#13;
1980 dollars compared with 1980 Maharashtra production costs of about US$320&#13;
for a more refined grade of sugar. 3/ Continued improvements in cane produc-&#13;
tivity, such as those discussed earlier, would help ensure the continued&#13;

a greater proportion of their sugar in the free market, with the propor-&#13;
tion falling gradually over several years to the same level as that of&#13;
existing plants. Moreover, they face lower excise taxes intially.&#13;

competitiveness of India's sugar exports by keeping costs down. The availabil-&#13;
ity of a buffer stock would give India greater control over the timing of sugar&#13;
exports to take advantage of fluctuations in world market prices.&#13;
22.       Policy Implications.   Sugarcane and sugar products policy in India&#13;
has been the subject of many detailed studies, each of which called for a&#13;
long-term, stable policy. The very volatility of the sugar economy, however,&#13;
has prevented this, and as noted earlier, sugar policies in India have been&#13;
changed frequently and substantially. As the sugar economy emerges from the&#13;
acute shortage and rapid price rises of the past year it is difficult to look&#13;
ahead to implementing longer-run policies. Yet successful implementation of&#13;
longer-term policies could also contribute to resolving the short and medium-&#13;
term problems of supply management.&#13;
23.       Sugarcane price policy is clearly central to the sugar economy.&#13;
The recent past has suggested that the prices set by the Agricultural Prices&#13;
Commission (APC) provided a reasonable stimulus to cane production. The price,&#13;
which has been uniform across states but linked to the sugar content of cane,&#13;
helps promote locational efficiency. The state advised prices and cooperative&#13;
profits distribution to cane growers, however, counteracted the APC efforts&#13;
and encouraged excess production in 1977/78 which led directly to the short-&#13;
ages and price rises in 1980. Hopefully, this experience will lead to greater&#13;
reliance on the APC's technical judgment and a realization that unrealisti-&#13;
cally high cane prices do not really benefit most farmers in the long run.&#13;
While it will be difficult to resist political pressures from farm groups to&#13;
raise prices, avoiding excessively high minimum support prices will be essen-&#13;
tial if the 1977/78 experience is to be avoided in the near future.&#13;
24.       A well executed cane price policy is an essential element but only&#13;
one element in a longer-term policy. Weather and price variations in other&#13;
sugarcane uses will continue to cause year-to-year variations around longer-&#13;
term trends in cane production. Due to the duration of the cane crop and&#13;
ratooning, these variations will tend to take time to even themselves out by&#13;
which time new shocks will have destabilized the system. A buffer stocking&#13;
policy implemented at a suitable time would offer the Government a useful tool&#13;
for controlling supply variations and dampening the price swings, thereby&#13;
reducing one of the sources of instability in cane production. Moreover, a&#13;
buffer stock could give the Government flexibility in the timing of its export&#13;
sales to take advantage of world market conditions. The suggestion of a&#13;
buffer stock dates back at least as far as the 1965 Sugar Enquiry Commission&#13;
Report and is included in the Sixth Plan. Concern over the cost of such a&#13;
policy has been one major reason why it has not been tried. Also, without&#13;
an appropriate cane price one could envision ever-increasing stocks of sugar&#13;
accumulating with the Government. With an appropriate cane price policy,&#13;
however, the costs of such a buffer stock could be kept reasonably low. By&#13;
keeping the stocks with the mills themselves (which managed stocks over 4&#13;
million tons in 1978) the Government could restrict its financial outlay to&#13;
the interest charges. Since India is just emerging from a sugar shortage, now&#13;
is obviously not the time to start a buffer stock. Next year, however, the&#13;
cane crop is likely to be much larger, perhaps approaching the 1977/78 level.&#13;
World market prices may be such that excess sugar production could be profit-&#13;
ably exported, but ISA quotas may limit such possibilities. In any case it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -&#13;
would seem to make sense for the Government to be ready from next year to&#13;
start establishing a buffer stock, should the domestic crop be large enough.&#13;
25.       In years of a short cane crop, mills will continue to have difficul-&#13;
ties in competing with gur and khandsari units since controls on sugar prices&#13;
put effective limits on prices mills can offer for cane. In this context and&#13;
after building up a sugar buffer stock, the possibility of gradually relaxing&#13;
and eventually removing the sugar levy system should be considered carefully.&#13;
While the rather disastrous experience with the recent decontrol may make it&#13;
difficult to advocate decontrol now, it is clear in retrospect that the timing&#13;
(when sugar stocks were over 4 million tons) and abruptness (including decon-&#13;
trol of monthly releases) of the 1978 decontrol had more to do with the&#13;
results than decontrol itself. If the Government maintained buffer stocks&#13;
plus controls on monthly releases, such wild market fluctuations would not be&#13;
possible. In addition to allowing mills to compete more effectively for cane,&#13;
such a decontrol would remove some of the locational inefficiencies built into&#13;
the present levy price system which pays higher prices for levy sugar to mills&#13;
located in areas with higher cane costs and which have higher conversion costs.&#13;
With decontrolled prices, mills would face the same prices, which would encour-&#13;
age new investment in low cost areas. In striving for better locational&#13;
efficiency the Government should also consider whether the present system of&#13;
greater investment incentives (in the form of lower proportions of levy sugar)&#13;
in areas with lower sugar recovery is in the long-term interest of the sugar&#13;
industry. 1/&#13;
26.       The mix of policies--an appropriate minimum price for cane, buffer&#13;
stocking, and gradual relaxation of the levy system--would go far in reducing&#13;
the year-to-year fluctuations in cane production and cane available to the&#13;
sugar mills. This would reduce' the market risks faced by farmers and mills&#13;
alike and would help to ensure that the Plan's investment goals in this indus-&#13;
try are met. Under this system the mills would be more certain of a steady&#13;
supply of cane and would not bear the entire burden of excessive stock buildup&#13;
should it develop in years of a large crop. The reciprocal instability in the&#13;
gur and khandsari sectors, which mirrors the instability in sugar would also&#13;
be reduced. By reducing the proportion of levy sugar gradually, incentives&#13;
for shifts to more efficient locations would build up gradually so that such&#13;
shifts would also be gradual, avoiding the hardship of a rapid dislocation.&#13;
27.       The long-term competitiveness of India's sugar economy depends on&#13;
its technical base. Continued emphasis should be placed on improving research&#13;
and extension efforts in both the cane production and the cane processing&#13;
fields. The general programs now underway to improve agricultural research&#13;
institutions and extension services in most states in India should continue&#13;
to receive high priority.&#13;
1/   It is by no means clear where locational advantages really lie.    We have&#13;
seen that Maharashtra's high yields and sugar recovery may be offset by&#13;
higher costs. Moreover, changes in technology and relative prices may&#13;
cause locational advantage to shift over time.&#13;

THE SUGAR ECONOMY&#13;
ANNEX&#13;
Supply and Demand Projections for Sugarcane&#13;
1. Sugarcane Production:&#13;
Three equations were estimated to project sugarcane production:&#13;
(i) an estimation of the rate of growth achieved over the 1967/68-1978/79&#13;
period:&#13;
ln (SCP) = 4.65520 + .03785(T); R2 = .69&#13;
(84.67)   (5.066)&#13;
where SCP equals sugarcane production in millions of tons and T = time&#13;
(1967/68 =1...).     Fiaures in parentheses are t statistics.&#13;
ii) an estimation of the rate of growth over the 1960/61-1978/79 period:&#13;
ln (SCP) = 4.5447 + .02700(T);   R2 = .66&#13;
(88.49)   (5.995)&#13;
where T = time (1960/61=1,...)&#13;
iii) an equation including the response of production to relative prices&#13;
as well as its trend rate of growth:&#13;
ln (SCP) = 4.455 + .02995(T) + .4487(ln(Pc)); R2 = .72&#13;
(77.7)   (7.10)      (3.086)&#13;
where T = time (1960/61=1,...) and Pc = an index of the average realized&#13;
cane price for the preceding two years deflated by the price index of&#13;
major competing crops (foodgrains, oilseeds, cotton). The average real-&#13;
ized cane price index was constructed by calculating a weighted average of&#13;
the index of statutory minimum cane prices (the official cane price index)&#13;
and the price index for gur during the main harvest months (Decem-&#13;
ber-March). The weights were the proportion of cane crushed by mills and&#13;
the proportion crushed by gur and khandsari units. For projection pur-&#13;
poses, the 20 year average value for Pc was used (1.122). The value for&#13;
Pc as of January 1981 was about 1.3183. This would imply a 1981/82 crop&#13;
of over 180 million tons. Using the 20 year average Pc(l.122) shifts the&#13;
production projections down from what they would have been had present&#13;
price levels been used. Thus this projection has an implicit assumption&#13;
of a 15% fall in relative cane prices.&#13;
2. Sweetener Production&#13;
To relate a given level of cane production to production of&#13;
sweeteners, the following equation was estimated:&#13;
TSP = .08774 SCP;     R2 = .9996&#13;
(218.14)&#13;
although this equation gives an excellent fit to the historical data it is&#13;
somewhat conservative to use it in the projections because the proportion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
of sugarcane being used for mill sugar is rising and mill sugar production&#13;
has higher extraction rates in terms of sugar (sucrose) than gur and&#13;
khandsari. Thus the sucrose content in the total volume of sweeteners&#13;
would tend to rise. Moreover, technical improvements in the sugar content&#13;
of cane and in extraction rates are probable during the projection period.&#13;
Consequently, the use of this fixed coefficient gives a somewhat downward&#13;
bias to the sweetener supply projections.&#13;
3. Sweetener Consumption&#13;
Total consumption for all sweeteners was estimated in several&#13;
different ways:&#13;
i) The historical trend was estimated using the equation:&#13;
ln(TSC) = 9.006 + .02444(T);    R2 = .83&#13;
(293.6) (9.54)&#13;
where TSC is total sweetener consumption and T is time (1960/61=1).&#13;
ii) Estimates of the relationships between total consumption of&#13;
sweeteners, total expenditures on all commodities and real prices&#13;
of sweeteners. These estimates were based on time series data for&#13;
the 1960/61-1978/79 period:&#13;
ln(TSC) = 5.01182 + .7631   ln(E) - .2178 ln(Ps); R2 = .98&#13;
(26.74)    (23.10)      (9.07)&#13;
where E is total private consumption expenditure in billions of&#13;
1970/71 Rupees (from CSO, National Accounts Statistics) and Ps&#13;
is the weighted average price index for sweeteners deflated by&#13;
the price index for all other commodities. For projection&#13;
purposes, E was assumed to grow alternattively at 5% and 3.5%&#13;
from its 1976/77-1979/80 average base of Rs. 356 billion. Ps&#13;
was assumed to be at its 20 year average of 1.294 whereas its&#13;
actual 1979/80 value was 1.395. Using the 20 year average Ps&#13;
shifts the demand projections up somewhat.&#13;
iii) The projections given in Tables 4A and 4B of Jon Hitchings&#13;
paper, Demand Projections for India, were used to provide&#13;
another set of demand projections after adjustments. The&#13;
figures in Tables 4A and 4B of that paper were used to calcu-&#13;
late separate growth factors for sugar and khandsari and gur.&#13;
Khandsari consumption (about 1 million tons in 1973/74) was&#13;
substracted from sugar and added to gur. The growth factors&#13;
were then applied to the 1973/74 base figures of 3.52 million&#13;
tons sugar and 8.35 million tons gur and khandsari. The total&#13;
sweetener demand projections thus calculated were then adjusted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
downward slightly to be consistent with the 13.1 million ton&#13;
1979/80 demand estimated from equation 3(ii) above. The&#13;
adjusted projections are given below in paragraph 5.&#13;
4. Sugar Consumption&#13;
The share of sugar in total sweetener consumption is growing,&#13;
reflecting changing consumer preferences. To project the quantity of&#13;
sugar in total consumption the following equation was estimated from&#13;
1960/61-1980/81 historical data:&#13;
ln(SPTSC) = -1.4034 + .02076 T;    R2 = .54&#13;
(27.06)   (4.80)&#13;
where SPTSC is sugar as a percent of total sweetener consumption. This&#13;
yields the following proportions of sugar for the future:&#13;
1985                  41.3%&#13;
1990                  45.8%&#13;
1995                  50.8%&#13;
2000                  56.4%&#13;
5. Production and Consumption Projections&#13;
The above equations and assumptions yield the following projections&#13;
for production and consumption.&#13;

6. Export Projections&#13;
Alternative projections of sweeteners available for export were&#13;
estimated by a) subtracting the NSS high consumption projection from the&#13;
"recent trend" production projection (equation 1(i) less 3(iii)) and b)&#13;
subtracting the time series, 3.5% expenditure growth demand projection&#13;
from the "long term trend with price effect" supply projection (equation&#13;
l(iii) less 3(ii)). Total domestic sugar consumption was estimated by&#13;
applying the proportions of sugar to total sweeteners estimated in&#13;
paragraph 4 above to the total domestic sweetener consumption projection.&#13;
This amount was then added to the export projection to given an estimate&#13;
of total sugar production requirements, for comparison with planned sugar&#13;
production capacity.&#13;

            India : demand and supply prospects for agriculture
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Since India's foodgrain situation
            began to improve after the mid-1970s, the World Bank's
            economic work on Indian agriculture has concentrated on the
            implications of this development both for foodgrains and for
            other major agricultural commodities. These papers report
            on: (i) projected demand for major agriculture commodities
            through the year 2000 based on consumption expenditure data
            along with estimates of future population and income growth,
            rates of urbanization and trends in the distribution of
            income; (ii) analysis of the long-run supply prospects
            compared with the projected demand; (iii) the possibility of
            foodgrain self-sufficiency and potential for an eventual
            exportable surplus; (iv) a possible persistent domestic
            shortage of vegetable oils, underlining the need for greater
            efforts by the agricultural support institutions to
            stimulate oilseed production and for an incentive pricing
            policy; and (v) an analysis of the sugar cycle stressing the
            disruptive effects of very large fluctuations around the
            production trend, which is essentially adequate to meet
            domestic requirements and provide for some exports.
