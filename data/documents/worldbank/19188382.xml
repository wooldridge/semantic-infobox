&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors&#13;
of 16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success&#13;
factorsâ&#128;&#153; selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this&#13;
prompted countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put&#13;
them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since the early years of the 2000s, Benin and its                  Overall, it remains possible for Benin to achieve its&#13;
development partners have been a leading example to the            Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for the water&#13;
subregion for using programmatic approaches to drive               supply subsectors provided the current level of financing&#13;
progress in the water supply sector forward.                       is sustained; the targets set for the sanitation subsectors,&#13;
                                                                   however, are still a long way from being attained.&#13;
The rural water supply subsector, in particular, has benefited&#13;
from both significantly increased levels of financing (both        The main challenge for the water supply and sanitation&#13;
domestic and donor) and accelerated coverage.                      (WSS) sector over the next few years remains&#13;
                                                                   decentralization, for which improvements in the necessary&#13;
The urban water supply subsector, which was separated              competencies at both deconcentrated and decentralized&#13;
from the electricity sector in 2004, has also seen positive        levels are required. An additional challenge consists&#13;
results, but efforts to mobilize finance need to be sustained      of ensuring the management of facilities is carried out&#13;
if demand from the rapidly increasing urban population is          in a more professional manner so as to safeguard the&#13;
to be met.                                                         sustainability of investment made in the rural water supply&#13;
                                                                   subsector.&#13;
The rural sanitation subsectorâ&#128;&#153;s adoption of a programmatic&#13;
approach is more recent, but its development is dependent          This second AMCOW Country Status Overview (CSO2)&#13;
upon promotional activities, the results of which have so far      has been produced in collaboration with the Government&#13;
been unsatisfactory. In urban areas there is still no sanitation   of Benin and other stakeholders.&#13;
policy: reform of the subsector only began in 2008.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                 Water Supply and Sanitation in Benin: Turning Finance into Services for 2015 and Beyond&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Secure employment conditions and further train contract employees working for the General Directorate of Water. At&#13;
     central and at deconcentrated levels, strengthen human resource capacity in both the General Directorate of Water&#13;
     and the Directorate of Hygiene and Basic Sanitation (DHAB: Direction de lâ&#128;&#153;HygiÃ¨ne et de lâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement de Base).&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Reinforce the planning, management, coordination, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation capacities of&#13;
     the DHAB and its deconcentrated departments.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Reinforce the human and financial resources dedicated to water supply, sanitation, and hygiene within the communes&#13;
     and improve their access to back-up support.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Continue to mobilize domestic and donor financing, as funding levels have been falling since 2009; in particular,&#13;
     increase financing for sanitation in both the urban and rural subsectors.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Systematically direct new financing towards those areas with the lowest access rates to water supply and sanitation&#13;
     to reduce regional disparities.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Improve the operation and management of the public expenditure system (public procurement procedures,&#13;
     disbursement procedures, and the transfer and authorization of expenditure) without creating parallel structures or&#13;
     channels, to improve the proportion of finance utilized.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Review the standards and definitions for access to water supply in rural areas so that access rates can be updated.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Update DG Waterâ&#128;&#153;s Integrated Database with additional facility and population data.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Improve monitoring and evaluation of the water supply and, in particular, the sanitation subsectors in rural areas by&#13;
     ensuring that the monitoring sheet templates are used by all external support agencies active in the sector and by&#13;
     ensuring that the data collection process involves the communes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Direct new finance towards the most poorly-covered areas (OuÃ©mÃ©, Atlantique, and Borgou) to reduce geographical&#13;
     disparities.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Assess and review the recruitment procedures for operators including specifications and contracts to improve the&#13;
     technical and financial performance of village water systems.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Provide capacity-building to communes and delegated operators on the technical and financial aspects of managing&#13;
     water supply services through the further development of an ongoing training program and back-up support from&#13;
     the deconcentrated technical departments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Increase the mobilization of finance required to meet MDG targets.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Reduce network losses by putting a rehabilitation program and preventative maintenance schedule in place.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Increase, systematize, and formalize the dialogue between SONEB (National Water Company of Benin: SociÃ©tÃ©&#13;
     Nationale des Eaux du BÃ©nin) and DG Water on planning within those communes where the two organizations operate,&#13;
     and between SONEB and the communes for the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of facility construction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                      3&#13;
&amp;#12;An AMCOW Country Status Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Increase the Ministry of Health and development partner funding allocated to sanitation and direct it to communes&#13;
       to empower them to act as contracting authorities.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 When allocating resources, ensure disadvantaged areas are taken into account.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Assess and review the approaches used to promote sanitation to the most disadvantaged populations.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Roll out a large-scale hygiene and sanitation promotion program that puts communes in the driving seat.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Put financing mechanisms in place to support and stimulate household demand for improved sanitation facilities,&#13;
       such as subsidies for the most disadvantaged households.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Develop and implement a human resources development plan for the DHAB and its divisions, in accordance with&#13;
       the 2007 audit, and improve the training provided to staff working in the sanitation and hygiene subsector at the&#13;
       commune level.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Accord greater priority to sanitation, notably at commune planning level, and consolidate the sanitation BPO based&#13;
       on commune planning and on a bottom-up approach.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Improve coordination between the different subsector stakeholders.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Improve the legal and regulatory framework of the sanitation and hygiene subsector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Implement the wastewater management strategy action plan, and notably:&#13;
    	     o	 Request funding from the state and development partners to finance the development of sanitation master plan&#13;
             and priority investments;&#13;
    	     o	 Put a sustainable finance mechanism in place for the urban sanitation subsector by introducing a sewerage&#13;
             surcharge to the water bill;&#13;
    	     o	 Develop pit emptying and sludge disposal services in the large towns and secondary centers; and&#13;
    	     o	 Improve consultation and coordination between all stakeholders.&#13;

&#13;
1.	Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in&#13;
collaboration with the Government of Benin and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

Coverage: Assessing Past Progress                             It should be noted that the access rates, shown in Figure&#13;
                                                              1, are based on combined rural and urban data. They&#13;
According to the Government of Beninâ&#128;&#153;s (GoB) estimates,       therefore conceal large differences, with rural areas clearly&#13;
the access rate to drinking water in the country stood        lagging behind urban areas as regards both water supply&#13;
at 51 percent at the end of 2008.3 If the current rate of     and sanitation (see Sections 7 to 10).&#13;
progress is maintained, the country will achieve its target&#13;
access rate of 73 percent in 2015.4 The Joint Monitoring      Investment Requirements:&#13;
Programme (JMP), which does not use sector data but           Testing the Sufficiency of Finance&#13;
rather the results of the household surveys undertaken by&#13;

exercising real leadership over the sector is the DHAB,     public procurement procedures. The deconcentrated&#13;
public policy and project implementation are dispersed      departments, themselves, also need to be further&#13;

   Priority actions for financing&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Continue to mobilize domestic and donor financing, as funding levels have been falling since 2009; in&#13;
      particular, increase financing for sanitation in both the urban and rural subsectors.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	   Systematically direct new financing (including that from NGOs) towards those areas with the lowest access&#13;
        rates to water supply and sanitation to reduce regional disparities.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	   Improve the operation and management of the public expenditure system (public procurement procedures,&#13;
        including those within SONEB, disbursement procedures and the transfer and authorization of expenditure)&#13;
        without creating parallel structures or channels, to improve the proportion of finance utilized.&#13;

Framework (MTEF) has improved the way in which state                       made to the rural water supply (RWS) subsector increased&#13;
financing is forecast. The monitoring of domestic and donor                fivefold between 2001 and 2008, rising from US$8.7 million&#13;
financing, in particular, has improved considerably since                  to US$44 million.17 Since 2009, however, a downward&#13;
2007.16 The number of external support agencies active in                  trend in funding levels has been observed in both the water&#13;

rural areas and US$90 million per year for urban areas        compared to peer group20&#13;
need be addressed if the MDG targets are to be achieved.&#13;
Regional equity is also not being respected: in both the                                RWS&#13;
water supply and sanitation subsectors, urban areas are&#13;
being overlooked in favor of rural areas (see Figure 5).&#13;
&#13;
The levels of financing committed by external support&#13;
agencies have increased at a faster rate than those               USH                               UWS&#13;
committed by the government: donors currently finance&#13;
around 80 percent of investment, increasing the&#13;
dependence of the sector on international aid.19&#13;
&#13;
Aid is still mainly provided in the form of project aid,                                RSH&#13;
particularly in the sanitation subsector; however, Benin&#13;

also set up, first for RWS, then for the urban water supply&#13;
(UWS) subsector. These new financing mechanisms were&#13;
made possible by the adoption and regular monitoring of       suitably qualified staff at both central and deconcentrated&#13;
BPOs on the one hand, and by increased dialogue between       levels are the two main factors impacting on the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

utilization of domestic commitments and 40 percent of&#13;
donor commitments utilized over the 2006â&#128;&#147;09 period.21         As far as financing the sector is concerned, the CSO2&#13;
The fact that the utilization rate is so low constitutes a    scorecard performance of Benin is satisfactory for RWS,&#13;
major constraint for the sector. The cumbersome nature        but results for the other three subsectors are below the&#13;
of the public procurement procedures and the lack of          peer-group average (see Figure 6).&#13;

   Priority actions for sector monitoring and evaluation&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Review the standards and definitions for access to water supply in rural areas so that access rates can be&#13;
      updated.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	   Update DG Waterâ&#128;&#153;s database with additional facility and population data.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	   Improve monitoring and evaluation of the water supply and, in particular, the sanitation subsectors in rural&#13;
        areas by ensuring that the monitoring sheet templates are used by all external support agencies active&#13;
        in the sector (inclusive of any facilities built outside the BPO, particularly those constructed by NGOs and&#13;
        decentralized cooperations) and by ensuring that the data collection process involves the communes.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Provide support to the communes and reinforce their competencies to enable them to undertake&#13;
      monitoring and evaluation tasks.&#13;

catalyst for reinforcing both the M&amp;E system and sector             compared to peer group22&#13;

Specific targets and indicators have been defined in the&#13;
BPOs. A system for collecting physical and financial data&#13;
is in the process of being set up, notably in the RWS&#13;
subsector, which will serve to inform sector budget support              USH                                      UWS&#13;

carried out in 2004â&#128;&#147;05, which gives a clearer indication&#13;
of the situation regarding access to drinking water. This&#13;
was then fed into the DG Waterâ&#128;&#153;s integrated database&#13;

the reliability of the statistics produced. Furthermore, the&#13;
standards and calculation methods used in relation to               The number of facilities constructed annually, notably&#13;
access to water supply need to be updated.23                        by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), is poorly&#13;

According to the JMP, the situation is even worse as            Figure 19&#13;
the 2008 access rate is estimated at only 4 percent. The        Average RSH scorecard scores for enabling,&#13;
discrepancy in access rate estimates is mainly due to the       developing and sustaining service delivery, and&#13;
fact that latrines shared between several households are        peer-group comparison&#13;
not considered improved by the JMP. As a result, they are                                   Enabling&#13;
excluded from the access rate, even though at least one&#13;
in 10 people use this type of latrine.39 Regardless of the&#13;
data source used, however, it is clear that Benin will not&#13;
achieve its 2015 targets for rural sanitation coverage (see&#13;
Figure 16).&#13;
&#13;
The fact that the anticipated increase in access rates has&#13;
not materialized is mainly due to the lack of financing.40&#13;
Although the budget allocated to sanitation and hygiene                   Sustaining                   Developing&#13;

around US$100 million per year between 2009 and&#13;
2015. Moreover, this figure only corresponds to capital         programs that have been conducted to date. The impact&#13;
investment (latrines) and excludes the cost of social           of community outreach has been equally poor as no&#13;
intermediation and training activities. A further US$8          financial support (subsidies, prefinancing, and repayment&#13;
million per year also needs to be added for facilities          mechanisms or others) has been provided to encourage&#13;
maintenance (see Figure 17). The funding requirements           households to invest in latrines. Households are expected&#13;
are therefore huge yet, since 2009, there has been a            to find their own means of financing their access to&#13;
reduction in public financing of the subsector.41 Financing     sanitation facilities. This approach has so far had little&#13;
levels need to increase a hundredfold, with priority funding    success: it is unrealistic given the level of poverty seen in&#13;
being given to those dÃ©partements with the lowest access        rural areas. As a result, an insufficient number of latrines&#13;
rates, namely Donga, Atacora, Plateau, Borgou, Collines         have been built (a few thousand latrines are constructed&#13;
and Alibori, and Couffo (where access rates are below           per year, mainly SanPlat latrines, whereas around 45,000&#13;
20 percent, whereas in Littoral the rate stands at nearly       latrines need to be built if the targets are to be met) and&#13;
80 percent42).                                                  projects provide no assistance to the poorest populations.&#13;
&#13;
The 2005â&#128;&#147;15 strategy and the national program advocate          A further bottleneck hindering the development of access&#13;
the promotion of sanitation facilities that are adapted         to sanitation is caused by the lack of large-scale, long-&#13;

huge effort is therefore required. At the moment, the&#13;
2015 target remains unattainable given the total lack of&#13;

&#13;
Awareness of the severity of the situation has come about&#13;
only recently. The first step taken to improve the subsector&#13;
involved clarifying the institutional set-up and defining&#13;
the strategic direction of the subsector. This led to the&#13;
                                                                         Sustaining                    Developing&#13;

also included the management of excreta, domestic,                     Averages, LICs, GNI p.p. &gt;$500&#13;
and industrial wastewater and stormwater. The strategic             Sources: CSO2 scorecard.&#13;
directions were very general, as these were mainly aimed&#13;
at laying the foundations of a subsector which had&#13;
previously been neglected. This strategy advocated that             surcharge is proposed which would be added to the water&#13;

&#13;
There is currently no sewerage service in place in Benin.           The development of on-site sanitation will require the&#13;
The strategy calls upon the communes and SONEB to                   simultaneous development of the pit emptying service&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Benin :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs2) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and
            what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's water and
            sanitation program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with United Nations
            Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization
            (WHO) in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has
            been produced in collaboration with the Government of Benin
            and other stakeholders during 2009-10. The analysis aims to
            help countries assess their own service delivery pathways
            for turning finance into water supply and sanitation
            services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water
            supply, and rural and urban sanitation, and hygiene. The
            CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past
            coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of future
            investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of
            particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.
            The CSO2's contribution is to answer not only whether
            past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector
            targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to
            ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated
            coverage in water supply and sanitation. In this spirit,
            specific priority actions have been identified through
            consultation. A synthesis report, available separately,
            presents best practice and shared learning to help realize
            these priority actions.
