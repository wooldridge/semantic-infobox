1. THE COUNTRY AND THE ECONOMY&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.1   The Country. El Salvador is the smallest country in Central America and,&#13;
with a population of about 5.4 million in an area of 21,000 sq. km., is the most&#13;
densely populated country in the&#13;
western hemisphere. Although    Box 1.1: Regional Indicators (1992)&#13;
social indicators are lower than    B . e a            to 1&#13;
the Latin America average, its                Illit-   Primay   Infant    GNP&#13;
per capita GNP of US$1,320 in                 eracy    School   Morta-    per&#13;

Almost 60% of the population&#13;

1.2    The Economy and the Energy Sector Before Reforms. During the 1980s El&#13;
Salvador's key macroeconomic and social indicators declined due to structural&#13;
imbalances, the 1986 earthquake and the civil war. Inflation, which averaged about&#13;
12% p.a. before 1980, reached as high as 32% in 1986. By 1994 it had slowed to&#13;
under 7%, down from 10% in 1993. It is predicted to be in the region of 5% in 1995&#13;
and 1996. GNP, which was US$6.5 billion in 1979, decreased in real terms to&#13;
US$5.9 billion in 1990, reducing per capita income from about US$1,270 to US$850.&#13;
Total energy demand per capita decreased over the period 1979-1989 by an average of&#13;
2.2% per year. However, electricity sales per capita increased by 2.5%, driven by a&#13;
shift in consumption from non-commercial energy (mainly fuelwood) to modern forms&#13;
of energy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. The Government's Reform Program&#13;
1.3   Initial Reforms. In   Box 1.2: El Salvador Indicators&#13;
1989, when the previous&#13;
government took office, its                                     1980   1993&#13;
goals were to: (a) end the   GNP per capita (1993 US$)          1,306  1,320&#13;
civil war; (b) reintroduce   External Debt/capita (1993 US$)   335    380&#13;
market discipline through a    Infant Mortality (per thousand)  75    40&#13;
structural adjustment        Life Expectancy at Birth (years)  57    65&#13;
program; and (c) alleviate   Energy Demand/capita (Mcal)       4,497  4,510&#13;
poverty. Impressive progress   Electricity Sales/capita (kWh)  278    465'&#13;
has been achieved on all&#13;
three fronts. After two years&#13;
of very difficult negotiations&#13;
and 12 months of armed peace, the war formally ended in December 1992 and a&#13;
peaceful political situation was established. With regard to market discipline, the&#13;
Government of El Salvador (GOES) launched a comprehensive macroeconomic reform&#13;
program in 1989 supported by the IMF and the Bank (Structural Adjustment Loan&#13;
(SAL) 1, 1991) which renewed growth from 1.1 % in 1989 to 3.4% in 1990, 3.5% in&#13;
1991, 4.6% in 1992, 5.1 % in 1993 and 5.8% (provisionally) in 1994, and reduced&#13;
inflation (see para 1.2). Social programs to alleviate poverty have improved&#13;
employment rates and increased real minimum wages by around 70% over the period&#13;
1989-1993.&#13;
1.4    Recent Reforms. The second phase of the reform program is now underway,&#13;
aiming to sustain and deepen the adjustment process. This phase is supported by the&#13;
IMF and the Bank, the latter through a US$50 million SAL 11 and a US$11 million&#13;
Technical Assistance Loan (TAL), Loan 3389-ES, approved by the Bank in 1991. The&#13;
reforms focus on: (a) modernizing the public sector; (b) fostering private sector&#13;
export-led growth; (c) improving the efficiency of social services and reducing&#13;
poverty; and (d) ensuring that development will be environmentally sustainable over&#13;
the long term. The SAL also supports reforms in the petroleum sector including the&#13;
elimination of price distortions and developing alternative systems of subsidies, and&#13;
the preparation of a new hydrocarbons law. The TAL supports the preparation of a&#13;
legal framework for protection of the environment.&#13;
1.5    Energy Sector Restructuring. As part of the reform effort, the government&#13;
has begun an ambitious restructuring of the energy sector. In September 1991 it&#13;
adopted an energy sector policy more consistent with the market-based economy being&#13;
developed in El Salvador. Its four objectives were to: (a) create an appropriate legal&#13;
and institutional framework for the sector; (b) adopt pricing policies and procedures&#13;
based upon economic costs and market forces; (c) increase private sector participation&#13;
in the energy sector; and (d) establish an institutional and policy framework to address&#13;
environmental issues. To support this, the TAL has financed studies on the sector's&#13;
legal and institutional framework, electricity pricing, the privatization of power&#13;
distribution, and the liberalization of oil prices. Also funded were engineering studies&#13;
to assess the best strategies for the rehabilitation, modernization and expansion of the&#13;
power generation, transmission and distribution systems. These studies form the basis&#13;
for the proposed project. The TAL has also financed the preparation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
environmental legislation regarding the energy and power sectors which has&#13;
subsequently been incorporated into the National Environmental Law, and will finance&#13;
the preparation of a Sectoral Environmental Assessment for the Power Sector (see&#13;
para 4.13).&#13;
II. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. Energy Resources and Consumption&#13;
2.1    Energy Resources. El Salvador's indigenous energy resources consist of&#13;
hydropower and geothermal potential, bagasse and other biomass products.&#13;
Hydroelectric potential is estimated at 1,600 MW, of which only 24% has so far been&#13;
installed. Geothermal potential is estimated at 330 MW, but extensive field&#13;
exploration is needed to assess its commercial viability. To date, 105 MW have been&#13;
installed and about 60 MW are expected to be installed within the next ten years. No&#13;
commercially exploitable oil or gas deposits have been identified and El Salvador&#13;
continues to rely on imports of oil, mainly from Venezuela and Mexico, through the&#13;
San Jose Agreement.&#13;
2.2    Energy Consumption and Losses. Economic growth in the last four years&#13;
has accelerated the demand for energy and shifted consumption away from traditional&#13;
forms of energy such as firewood. Total end-use energy consumption grew at 6%&#13;
p.a. from 1989-1993, but firewood's share of the total declined by 17% and the share&#13;
of petroleum and electricity increased by 4% and 2%, respectively. The share of total&#13;
energy consumed by transport, industry and agriculture combined grew by 3.9%&#13;
while that of commercial and residential sectors declined by 4%, reflecting the growth&#13;
in the economy. In 1993, the residential and commercial sectors accounted for 54%&#13;
of the total, followed by transport (22%), industry/agriculture (22%) and other (2%).&#13;
2.3    The chief energy source for   Box 2.1: Energy Balance for El Salvador,&#13;
domestic use is fuelwood, which      1993&#13;
accounted for 49 % of the total energy&#13;
consumed in 1993. Oil (crude and&#13;
derivatives) accounted for 31 %,        l                 TCal    %&#13;
geothermal energy (to generate&#13;
electricity) for 8%, bagasse and other    Hydroelectric   1737    5.7&#13;
biomass for 6.5%, and hydroelectricity    Geothermal      2324     7.7&#13;
for 6%. Diesel oil and gasoline, used     oil Products    9276    30.6&#13;
mainly by the transport sector,&#13;
accounted for 64% of petroleum            Fuelwood        15006    49.5&#13;
consumption and fuel oil, used mainly     Biomass         1961     6.5&#13;
by the industrial sector, accounted for&#13;
18%.                                     Total           30305    100.0&#13;
2.4    Electricity consumption has      Source: Balance Energetico 1993, CEL&#13;
grown strongly over the five years to&#13;
1994, averaging 9%, with the largest&#13;
increases coming from commercial (10.9% average p.a.) and industrial (8.9% average&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
p.a.) customers. This has been due largely to the increase in economic activity, and&#13;
was in spite of a near doubling of electricity prices in real terms (see Box 2.2). Per&#13;
capita power consumption is relatively low compared to that of other Latin American&#13;
countries, although access to electricity increased from 33% of the population in 1980&#13;
to 61 % in 1993 (91 % of people in the urban centers have electricity service,&#13;
compared with only 27 % in rural areas). The negative impact of the dislocation&#13;
during the 1980s is shown by the longer term growth rates for electricity sales.&#13;
Industrial consumption, 31 % of total consumption in 1994, was lower in 1989 than in&#13;
1980, and over the period 1975-1994 grew at only 3.4%. Residential (35%), and&#13;
government and municipal (16.5%) consumption grew steadily (7.3% p.a. and 7.4%&#13;
p.a., respectively) during the same period; consumption by commercial consumers&#13;
(16%) grew at 6.6% p.a.&#13;
B. Organization and Management&#13;
2.5    The Ministry of Economy through the Directorate of Energy, Mines and&#13;
Hydrocarbons (DEMH), regulates the hydrocarbons sector, while Comisi6n Ejecutiva&#13;
Hidroelectrica del Rio Lempa (CEL), a government owned public utility, is in charge&#13;
of the power sector, under the supervision of the Ministry of Economy. Annexes 2.1&#13;
and 2.2 show the organizational arrangements of the GOES and of CEL. In the past,&#13;
the government exercised heavy control over the energy and power sectors. Until&#13;
1989, CEL formulated energy policy, planned development and issued regulations,&#13;
spanning upstream activities in the petroleum subsector, hydrocarbon imports and fuel&#13;
distribution, as well as the entire power sector. In 1990, with the creation of the&#13;
DEMH, the government removed CEL's responsibilities to supervise activities related&#13;
to petroleum products.&#13;
2.6   In spite of the reforms introduced in the last three years, public and private&#13;
monopolies still dominate the energy sector in El Salvador. In the petroleum sector,&#13;
the government holds a monopoly on crude oil imports. Firms wishing to import&#13;
refined products require permits from the DEMH. In addition, DEMH regulates&#13;
retail prices for petroleum products. The Oil Refinery of Acajutla (RASA) owned by&#13;
ESSO (65%) and Shell (35%) has a de facto monopoly to import crude oil and refined&#13;
products, except for those imported directly by CEL, since it has the country's only&#13;
storage facilities and access to this has not yet been liberalized.&#13;
2.7    Within the power sector, CEL continues to operate as a vertically integrated&#13;
monopoly. Until 1986, power distribution (except for rural areas) was in the hands&#13;
of the private sector through concessions that finished that year. At that time, GOES&#13;
bought the assets of the distribution companies and CEL became responsible for&#13;
power distribution with the previously private sector concessions being administered&#13;
by CEL, although they have been maintained in their original structure to facilitate&#13;
their eventual reprivatization. CEL generates almost all the power supplied to the&#13;
public grid. The Electric Power Company of El Salvador (CAESS), the main power&#13;
distribution company, distributes electricity in the capital city and environs,&#13;
representing 68% of the total retail consumption in 1994. The other six power&#13;
companies and CEL account for 17% and 11% of the country's retail consumption&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
C. Energy Pricing&#13;
2.8   In spite of recent reforms, which have liberalized the setting of margins and&#13;
aligned prices near to those in international markets, diesel oil for public transport and&#13;
LPG for home consumption are still subsidized (totalling about US$30 million in&#13;
1993).&#13;
2.9    Electricity prices are currently  Box 2.2 Average Retail Electricity&#13;
set by the Ministry of Economy, based    Prices (Colones/kWh)&#13;
upon proposals put forward by CEL. At&#13;
present no legislation in force                       Current  Curren   Real&#13;

respectively). Box 2.2 shows the              1990     0.20     2.7   0.28&#13;

condition to negotiate the proposed loan.   July 1994    0.66   7.6   0.56&#13;
An additional increase over present&#13;
levels, of about 40%, will be needed in   Source: CEL and the World Bank&#13;
real terms to align tariffs with marginal&#13;
costs.&#13;
2.10   Under the terms of a loan with the Inter-American Development Bank, the&#13;
GOES is committed to increasing tariffs to 85% of long run marginal costs (LRMC)&#13;
by 1996. As a condition under this loan, the GOES has agreed to increase tariffs to&#13;
100% of LRMC by 1999 (para 8.4).&#13;
D. Sector Restructuring&#13;
2.11   In the Energy Sector Policy issued by the government in May 1991, and in&#13;
further policy developments, it was determined that the following would be some of&#13;
the main objectives of energy sector reform: (a) the power subsector would be&#13;
liberalized and partly privatized; (b) the distribution companies would be transferred&#13;
to the private sector; and (c) the petroleum subsector, currently operated by the&#13;
private sector, would be further deregulated, monopolies broken up, and the&#13;
remaining fuel subsidy eliminated. Legislation embodying these principles was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
presented to the Legislative Assembly in April 1995, aiming to foster competition,&#13;
eliminate inefficient regulation and reduce government intervention in the business&#13;
functions of the publicly-owned entities. The marginal cost and tariff study carried&#13;
out by CEL in 1993, funded by the Bank Power Sector TAL, defined tariff adjustment&#13;
mechanisms to meet marginal costs and to offset inflation and exchange rate&#13;
variations. The study also delineated tariff regulations for monopolistic activities&#13;
(transmission rates and retail distribution sales). The new legislation incorporates&#13;
these mechanisms and principles. The inter-governmental coordinating body, Unidad&#13;
Estudios Sectoriales (UES) is responsible for executing the studies funded by the&#13;
TAL. UES is composed of representatives of the Ministries of Planning and Economy&#13;
and of CEL. Under the proposed project, UES will assist in the execution of the&#13;
technical assistance components.&#13;
2.12   The GOES presented to the Legislative Assembly in April 1995 three laws&#13;
related to the electricity sector: the Electricity Law, and the legislation to establish,&#13;
respectively, the National Energy Council (NEC) and the Electricity and&#13;
Hydrocarbons Regulatory Commission (EHRC), the proposed planning and regulatory&#13;
bodies for the sector. The Hydrocarbons Law has already been presented to Congress.&#13;
The Electricity Law separates planning, regulatory and operating functions in the&#13;
power sector, and ensures open access of power generators to the national&#13;
interconnected grid and distribution networks. In addition, it establishes the&#13;
procedures for IPPs participation in bidding to supply energy to power distribution&#13;
companies (and others) and for regulating retail prices. It also calls for environmental&#13;
assessments of proposed projects and proof of project clearance by the appropriate&#13;
environmental authority as part of sector licensing requirements. The proposed NEC&#13;
and EHRC Laws establish responsibilities, organization and financing procedures for&#13;
the functioning of these entities. The new legislation will also establish a concession&#13;
regime that will define the private sector's responsibilities. The GOES is strongly&#13;
committed to the legislation, which is expected to pass through Congress later in the&#13;
year. As evidence of this commitment to reform, in 1994 Congress approved&#13;
legislation permitting the privatization of distribution, and CEL presented on April 4,&#13;
1995, a time-bound plan for their privatization to the President of El Salvador (the&#13;
plan is known as the Power Distribution Plan, or Plan Integral de Gestion del Servicio&#13;
Publico de Distribucion de Energia Electrica). CEL has already contracted to&#13;
purchase 80 MW from an American independent power producer, due to start&#13;
operation in late 1995.&#13;
2.13   The Hydrocarbons Law will correct most of the inefficiencies of current&#13;
policy, which discourages foreign investors from exploration activities, and is the&#13;
basis for the government monopoly for crude oil imports. The law will also improve&#13;
conditions for competition, specify minimum technical and quality standards for&#13;
petroleum products and introduce measures to protect the environment against oil&#13;
spills and pollution.&#13;
2.14   When the new laws are enacted and with the entry of the private sector into&#13;
the power subsector, a new generation and transmission planning scheme and a new&#13;
regulatory framework will be in place. The proposed NEC and the EHRC would deal&#13;
with planning and regulatory activities, respectively. NEC would be responsible for&#13;
energy policy and indicative planning, currently assumed by CEL for power and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Ministry of Economy for petroleum. NEC would only perform indicative expansion&#13;
planning. It would be composed of representatives of CEL, the Ministry of Planning,&#13;
Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Agriculture. The responsibilities of NEC and&#13;
EHRC will also include environmental quality control clearance of projects with&#13;
regard to satisfaction of environmental guidelines and verification that licenses and&#13;
authorizations have been obtained from appropriate authorities.&#13;
2.15   EHRC would be an independent entity with the power to regulate rates for&#13;
transmission services and for the distribution companies. The latter would be based&#13;
upon a benchmarking technique which would involve the estimation of the cost of&#13;
service for an "efficient" distribution company, taking into account the consumer&#13;
density and other factors specific to the service area. Charging for transmission&#13;
services would be based upon an average cost methodology, allowing for the cost of&#13;
capital and of operations and maintenance. Finally, EHRC would regulate prices&#13;
charged for generation until the time at which it determines that the market for&#13;
generation is competitive. After this point, prices for generation would be subject to&#13;
negotiation between the generators and their customers which could include both&#13;
distributors and final consumers of electricity. Until this time, generation costs would&#13;
be calculated as the short run marginal costs of energy, as modelled by the EHRC and&#13;
subject to discussion with generators and distributors, and the cost of peaking&#13;
capacity.&#13;
2..16 Autonomy of the EHRC is expected to be achieved by rigorous qualifications&#13;
and phased nominations of commissioners and by the requirement of both the&#13;
Executive and Legislative authorities approval for appointments. EHRC would also&#13;
authorize the operation of some types of power plants (geothermal, hydro and&#13;
nuclear), and verify environmental and technical aspects of proposed projects and&#13;
award power distribution concessions. In petroleum, EHRC would be mainly&#13;
responsible for granting exploration concessions and regulating the price of refining&#13;
activities as long as de facto monopoly conditions persist.&#13;
2.17   A Sectoral Environmental Assessment to be undertaken for the power sector&#13;
(see paras. 4.13 - 4.15), which has been initiated prior to negotiations, will review the&#13;
new environmental and energy sector laws and regulations and will recommend&#13;
allocations of responsibilities among different agents in the power sector. It will&#13;
propose: (a) environmental assessment guidelines for future projects; (b) pollution&#13;
emission and ambient quality guidelines for future projects; and (c) management and&#13;
control procedures to be followed during construction and operation of power&#13;
facilities.&#13;
E. Overall Energy Demand Forecasts&#13;
2.18   The rate of growth of energy demand, and the composition of this demand, is&#13;
expected to reflect the growth and modernization of El Salvador's economy.&#13;
Assuming a 4% per annum increase in GDP, the demand for energy would increase&#13;
by 5.2% per annum overall. The share of firewood is expected to decline from over&#13;
40% of the total at present to 28% by the year 2010. Commercial forms of energy&#13;
(petroleum products, electricity) are forecast to increase their share from a present&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
level of 50% to over 65% by 2010. Forecasts of electricity demand are reported in&#13;
Section 3.&#13;
III. THE POWER SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. Electricity Consumption and Supply&#13;
3.1    Trends in Electricity Consumption. From 1980 to 1990, electricity&#13;
consumption grew on average at a rate of only 3.8% per year, due to the civil war,&#13;
earthquake and prevailing economic problems. The move towards a more stable&#13;
macroeconomic environment prompted an acceleration of growth, with annual&#13;
increases of 6.0% in 1991, 5.8% in 1992, and 15.8% in 1993 (the latter year&#13;
reflecting an easing of supply shortages). In 1994, growth of 9.5% meant that total&#13;
sales of electricity were 2,591 GWh, with per capita consumption of 465 kWh&#13;
(compared to 1,277 in Costa Rica, 1,110 in Panama, 340 in Honduras, 323 in&#13;
Nicaragua and 295 in Guatemala - these representing 1993 estimates). In El Salvador&#13;
61 % of the population has access to electricity, compared to 94% in Costa Rica, 64%&#13;
in Panama, 39% in Honduras, 42% in Nicaragua and 38% in Guatemala. Sales to&#13;
residential consumers make up 35% of the total, representing the largest category.&#13;
This group has shown the highest growth rate in sales over the longer term (1975-94)&#13;
of 7.3% per annum on average. The industrial sector presently accounts for just over&#13;
30% of sales. Sales to the commercial sector, and to government and municipalities&#13;
account for the remainder of consumption (Annexes 3.2 and 3.3 provide more details&#13;
on historical sales and number of connections in the sector). Box 3.1 below presents&#13;
a comparison of GDP growth and growth in electricity sales.&#13;
3.2    Power demand is expected to grow rapidly in El Salvador over the period&#13;
1995-2000, driven by GDP growth and a shift from traditional fuels to commercial&#13;
fuels, such as electricity. In conjunction with the consultants Econometria, CEL has&#13;
developed a set of demand forecasts (see Annex 9. 1 for reference), based upon&#13;
modelling the demand for&#13;
both energy and power of    Box 3.1: GDP and Electricity Demand Evolution&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
conditionalities under the IDB Loan (para 2.10). Sales to the commercial and&#13;
industrial sectors are forecast to grow most rapidly (see Annex 3.4). By the year&#13;
2000, total final sales are forecast to be 3532 GWh. The decline in the share of&#13;
residential consumers means that system load factor is forecast to improve slightly,&#13;
from 61 % to 63%. Low case and high case sales forecasts were developed, resulting&#13;
in a forecast growth in electricity sales of 2.4% per annum and 6.7% per annum&#13;
respectively over the period 1995 to 2000. Under the low case, total sales would be&#13;
3023 GWh in the year 2000, and under the high case 3785 GWh (see Annex 3.4).&#13;
3.3    Demand Side Management. In El Salvador, demand side management has&#13;
not received the attention it warrants over the past decade, because of: (a) economic&#13;
disruptions caused by the civil conflict; (b) the high priority assigned to containing&#13;
damage to electricity supply system during the conflict; and (c) the supply orientation&#13;
of the state monopoly. In electricity systems with serious quality and reliability&#13;
problems, the most effective demand management instrument is pricing and&#13;
billing/collection which the GOES has begun effectively using over the past two years.&#13;
Significant progress has been made and is planned over the next three years with&#13;
respect to tariff levels, their structure, and adjustment mechanisms to bring pricing&#13;
into line with marginal costs of service (para. 2.10). These measures, together with&#13;
improvements in commercial performance (ie reductions in non technical losses),&#13;
provide strong incentives to consumers for efficient use of electricity. In addition, the&#13;
government and CEL have prepared a program for energy conservation which focuses&#13;
on developing and marketing energy efficient equipment for final users and for&#13;
disseminating information on efficient use of energy more generally. The IDB project&#13;
is providing technical and financial support for the implementation of this program.&#13;
B. The Existing Power System&#13;
3.4   Installed Generating Capacity. In 1993 the installed public service capacity&#13;
of the country (i.e. excluding industrial own-generation, of approximately 50 MW)&#13;
was 833 MW. CEL's total installed capacity was 817.5 MW, of which 388 MW was&#13;
hydro, 324.5 MW conventional thermal units and 105 MW geothermal plants. CAESS&#13;
has 11.5 MW of hydro capacity; combined, the other distribution utilities own 4.4&#13;
MW of hydro capacity. In 1994 gross power generation amounted to 3146 GWh.&#13;
3.5    Generation, transmission and distribution facilities seriously deteriorated over&#13;
the 1980s, due to sabotage and the continuous overloading of facilities to compensate.&#13;
Plants were poorly maintained because the limited resources were used to repair&#13;
sabotage damage, resulting in a low reliability of service and high voltage and&#13;
frequency variations. The situation worsened in 1990-1992, due to the drought and the&#13;
rapid increase in demand that occurred with economic recovery. As an emergency&#13;
measure, CEL installed three gas turbines with a total capacity of 155 MW in 1993&#13;
and imported additional energy from Guatemala. Almost all thermal plant have now&#13;
been rehabilitated, funded by IDB and international donors. Further, the Soyapango&#13;
thermal plant is being repowered, financed by CEL's own funds and with commercial&#13;
loans. The refurbishment of hydroelectric plants, including upgrading of&#13;
technologically obsolete equipment, would be financed by the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
3.6    The Transmission System. In the 1980s, there were over 2,000 attacks on&#13;
substations and 3,800 on transmission lines, costing CEL about US$200 million.&#13;
Repeated damage lead to temporary repairs and CEL had insufficient resources to&#13;
follow up with permanent repairs. As a result, the current operation of the system is&#13;
unreliable, and transmission losses have increased from 4% in 1986 to around 6% at&#13;
present. Based on an engineering study funded by the Bank's TAL, the rehabilitation&#13;
of the transmission system is underway, with financing from the IDB and the&#13;
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan.&#13;
3.7    The Distribution System. Sabotage, particularly in rural areas, and low levels&#13;
of investment in the network, combined with the rapid increase in demand in recent&#13;
years have lead to a heavily overloaded power system. Network investments have&#13;
been low because: (a) the former owners of the distribution networks were uncertain&#13;
about the political environment and the compensation that they would receive for their&#13;
assets from GOES once their concessions were terminated (they reached an agreement&#13;
with the government and were finally reimbursed); and (b) after the distribution&#13;
companies were transferred to CEL, a lack of resources. Congress has authorized the&#13;
privatization of the distribution sector and CEL has presented a plan for their transfer&#13;
to the private sector to the President of El Salvador (para. 2.12). Private investors will&#13;
therefore be funding the bulk of the rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution&#13;
network, although the GOES may still have some role in funding rural electrification&#13;
in areas that are commercially unattractive.&#13;
C. Power System Expansion&#13;
3.8    CEL, working with the consultants MONENCO Agra Inc. has developed a&#13;
least-cost expansion plan for the power sector (see Annex 3.5 for a more detailed&#13;
description of the plan). Based on this, CEL has produced a modified expansion plan&#13;
which includes the addition of a third unit at the Cerron Grande scheme (see Annex&#13;
9.1 for reference). Although this addition was not within the strict least cost&#13;
expansion plan, the present value of cost between the expansion with Cerron Grande 3&#13;
and without is less than 0.4% of the total. The inclusion of this unit provides CEL&#13;
with some operating cost savings and a reduction in anticipated unserved energy. The&#13;
scheme will provide CEL with additional peaking capacity and generation reserve. It&#13;
is also a relatively simple scheme, as the civil works are already in place, having been&#13;
constructed in an earlier phase of the project and will provide CEL with some security&#13;
should other generating projects suffer delays. The addition of the third unit at Cerron&#13;
Grande 3 will be financed by the proposed project.&#13;
3.9    The modified expansion plan does not contain any other hydro developments&#13;
apart from the expansion of the 5 de Noviembre scheme. Under this plan, by the&#13;
year 2000 total installed capacity will be 1360 MW. Thermal power capacity would&#13;
increase from the current 40% of total installed to about 43% by year 2000, hydro's&#13;
share would decrease from 48% to 42% and geothermal's share would rise from 13%&#13;
to 15%. The TAL is financing pre-feasibility studies of four candidate hydro&#13;
projects; the proposed project will finance feasibility studies of the most promising&#13;
two of these. Based on their outcome, the hydro share in the long-term expansion&#13;
plan may increase. The 1995-99 time slice of the Power Sector Investment Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Ii&#13;
calls for a total of US$ 896 million of investment, of which 67% would be invested in&#13;
generation, 14% in transmission and 11 % in distribution (Annex 6. 1).&#13;
D. Bank Involvement in the Sector&#13;
3.10   So far, the Bank (IBRD and IDA) has approved one credit and eight loans for&#13;
the power sector, amounting to US$109.0 million (Annex 6.6). The first five&#13;
(totalling US$52.7 million) helped develop the Lempa river basin and the geothermal&#13;
field at Ahuachapan. A US$6.3 million credit helped finance the Soyapango gas&#13;
turbine plant. Two additional loans (totalling US$39.0 million) helped finance the&#13;
Ahuachapan geothermal power plant and its expansion. The latest loan (the US$1 1.0&#13;
million TAL) is helping the government and CEL carry out sectoral and engineering&#13;
studies aimed at improving the sector's efficiency.&#13;
IV. THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
4.1    GOES of El Salvador is currently engaged in a comprehensive effort to&#13;
increase its capacity to halt environmental degradation and improve management of its&#13;
natural resources. This effort is supported by IDB through the El Salvador&#13;
Environmental Program, a three-year project approved in June 1993, and by the&#13;
World Bank through the SAL 11 and TAL Projects. Amongst other initiatives, the&#13;
loans provide for the drafting of a National Environmental Law, preparation of a&#13;
National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan, and redefinition of the role,&#13;
position and internal organization of the National Council for the Environment&#13;
(CONAMA) and its Executive Secretariat (SEMA). The framework law, SEMA's&#13;
organic law and a set of six new or revised laws relating to specific environmental&#13;
aspects are scheduled for presentation to the National Assembly in 1995. The&#13;
Environmental Strategy and Action Plan are also scheduled for approval by&#13;
CONAMA in the near future.&#13;
B. Institutional and Regulatory Framework&#13;
4.2    SEMA's draft organic law defines the agency's role and organization, as well&#13;
as its relation to other public sector entities, such as CEL, whose operations have&#13;
significant environmental impacts. In the proposed institutional structure, all such&#13;
entities would participate in a committee of sectoral environmental units. Draft&#13;
environmental impact assessment (EIA) guidelines, which list the main elements (such&#13;
as screening criteria, project review requirements and procedures throughout the&#13;
project cycle) are already available and will be approved in 1995. Although work on&#13;
emission standards is included in the IDB project, authorities are giving more priority&#13;
to preparation of norms on water quality. Thus, it is unlikely that air pollution stan-&#13;
dards, which are directly linked to the operation of thermal power plants, will be&#13;
available shortly. The government has agreed with the Bank to use international and&#13;
Bank's standards until new national regulations are enacted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
4.3    EIAs will be required for most public and private energy projects. These are&#13;
to be prepared by the developers of the projects and reviewed through a decentralized&#13;
system involving local and sectoral agencies. EIAs for public sector projects would&#13;
also be reviewed by the Ministry of Planning, as part of the analysis of the projects'&#13;
feasibility. Final clearances from SEMA or other relevant environmental agencies&#13;
will also be required by the EHRC for projects to be authorized or licensed.&#13;
4.4    The proposed reforms emphasize SEMA's role in strategic planning and the&#13;
production of guidelines and standards, for example in the power sector, but imple-&#13;
mentation, monitoring and evaluation of projects will be carried out by decentralized&#13;
entities. For example, SEMA will not implement natural resource management&#13;
programs (such as in forestry) or directly monitor compliance with norms and&#13;
proposed mitigation measures (such as project-specific environmental action plans in&#13;
the power sector). Instead, monitoring and evaluation are to be conducted through the&#13;
sectoral environmental units in local and sectoral line agencies. For its part, SEMA&#13;
will supervise monitoring/evaluation activities and provide technical support to the&#13;
sectoral agencies through its environmental information system and training programs.&#13;
C. Environmental Issues&#13;
4.5    Existing Facilities. CEL has twelve power plants currently in operation.&#13;
Under the IDB project, environmental impact assessments have been carried out for&#13;
the Acajutla thermal plant and for the exploration of the Berlin and San Vicente&#13;
geothermal fields. A summary identification of environmental problems is available&#13;
for other power plants in operation (Guajoyo, Cerr6n Grande, 5 de Noviembre, and&#13;
15 de Septiembre hydropower stations; San Miguel and Miravalle thermal plants).&#13;
TMe proposed project will fund environmental impact assessments for the four hydro&#13;
plants mentioned above (para 6.6).&#13;
4.6    Existing operating facilities, with the exception of those associated with&#13;
geothermal generation, currently pose low risks to air and water quality and to the&#13;
loss of natural habitat. Nonetheless, environmental protection measures should be&#13;
introduced to avoid aggravation of these problems and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
should be carried out on a regular basis. Air pollution is of increasing concern in&#13;
urban areas such as San Salvador and Acajutla, where vehicular and industrial&#13;
concentration are most dense, and emissions from future or reactivated thermal plants&#13;
could become critical. The Soyapango thermal plant, located in a densely populated&#13;
neighborhood of the San Salvador Metropolitan region, has been idle since 1992 but is&#13;
to be repowered. The proposed Sector Environmental Assessment (see paras 4.13 -&#13;
4.15) will provide environmental impact assessments for CEL's existing generating&#13;
plants including the repowering of Soyapango (see Annex 4.1 for the terms of&#13;
reference for this study). The problem of water contamination caused by the&#13;
discharges of the Ahuachapan geothermal plant is being addressed in a satisfactory&#13;
manner with funds and technical assistance from the IDB.&#13;
4.7   Inappropriate agricultural practices and deforestation in the Lempa River basin&#13;
have lead to reservoir siltation and damage to equipment in four of CEL's&#13;
hydropower plants. Although CEL has carried out river basin management activities&#13;
in the most critical areas, a more comprehensive program is outside the company's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
mandate and its technical and financial resources. The IDB will finance these&#13;
activities for the upper and middle segments of the Lempa River basin, under the loan&#13;
for the SEMA project, in which CEL will also participate. CEL is undertaking a&#13;
study regarding removal of the sediment; a component in the proposed project will&#13;
provide for the purchase of equipment necessary for sedimentation control.&#13;
4.8    Future Facilities. In addition to rehabilitating and expanding existing plants&#13;
and transmission systems, CEL's expansion plan calls for the addition of 199.5 MW&#13;
of new capacity by 1999. Two hydroelectric projects will be selected for further&#13;
evaluation out of four for which pre-feasibility studies are now being conducted under&#13;
the Bank's Power Sector TAL. Preliminary environmental evaluations of these&#13;
candidate projects are already available. Feasibility studies of the two best options,&#13;
which will include complete environmental impact assessments, will be financed by&#13;
the technical assistance component of the proposed ESM project (para 6.6).&#13;
4.9    Under the power sector's proposed institutional reform, expansions in&#13;
capacity, especially through thermal plants, are to be undertaken preferably by&#13;
independent private producers (IPPs). Feasibility studies for these and any other&#13;
plants, whether developed by IPPs or by CEL, will be expected to include ElAs,&#13;
which are to be reviewed by sectoral and local agencies, in accordance with the&#13;
country's EIA legislation.&#13;
4.10   Environmental Review, Monitoring and Evaluation Functions. CEL needs&#13;
to strengthen its capacity to carry out environmental impact assessments and&#13;
implement environmental mitigation programs. EHRC and the DEMH will need to&#13;
develop their capacity to review the environmental impact assessments submitted by&#13;
public and private power producers and monitor/evaluate projects. The SEA will&#13;
recommend guidelines and procedures for preparation and review of environmental&#13;
impact assessments in the power sector and emission and/or ambient standards to be&#13;
used as a reference, until national standards are available (see Annex 8.1). The 80&#13;
MW IPP diesel-electric power plant contracted by CEL will follow international&#13;
emission standards.&#13;
D. CEL's Capacity for Environmental Assessment and Management&#13;
4.11   CEL's Environmental Unit was created in June, 1992 and brought together&#13;
various units that were engaged in environmental activities in diverse projects (such as&#13;
river basin management, maintenance of the grounds of CEL's facilities, hydrological&#13;
studies, non-conventional energy projects), and that were also responsible for&#13;
conducting environmental impact assessments. The unit's mandate, internal&#13;
organization and relative position within CEL's structure have been clarified.&#13;
However, its staff need to be trained. These issues are being addressed under the&#13;
ongoing El Salvador Emergency Project, financed by the IDB, whose main purpose is&#13;
to provide technical assistance for institutional strengthening of public entities. As a&#13;
first stage, this project will propose the unit's organization and a training program.&#13;
4.12   The proposed ESM Project will assist power sector entities to design an&#13;
institutional framework for environmental management, taking into consideration the&#13;
roles to be played by SEMA, the EHRC and DEMH. More specifically, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
organizational model for CEL's Environment Unit should be determined by the&#13;
environmental services it will be called upon to provide given CEL's revised mandate&#13;
and likely future involvement in activities such as expansion planning, engineering&#13;
studies, and plant operation. Definition of these services thus depends on the division&#13;
of responsibilities among sectoral entities, which is still to be approved and detailed,&#13;
as well as on the extent and timing of private sector participation which is envisaged.&#13;
The SEA will provide detailed proposals and recommendations on these issues, taking&#13;
into account the sector's new legislation. It is expected and highly desirable that the&#13;
management and key senior staff within CEL and the EHRC would take an active part&#13;
in the institutional analysis and the discussion of the Environment Unit's mandate,&#13;
relative position, internal organization, and staffing needs.&#13;
E. Environmental Assessment&#13;
4.13   For environmental purposes, the Bank has rated the proposed ESM project as&#13;
"Type B", since it focuses on technical assistance for sectoral reform and&#13;
rehabilitation of existing facilities. However, due to current environmental problems&#13;
in CEL's existing facilities and the scope of IDB's projects, the GOES agreed to the&#13;
implementation of a Sectoral Environmental Assessment for the power sector. CEL&#13;
prepared terms of reference acceptable to the Bank (Annex 4. 1). The consultant will&#13;
be selected during May 1995 and the study will be completed by the end of 1995.&#13;
4.14   The main objectives of the sectoral environmental assessment are to:&#13;
(a)    review, from a social and environmental perspective, the current legal,&#13;
institutional, and technical framework of the environmental sector;&#13;
(b)    propose the norms and procedures for the power sector's activities;&#13;
special emphasis will be placed on emission standards and on&#13;
guidelines for appropriate environmental impact assessment during&#13;
planning and for management of the project cycle;&#13;
(c)    evaluate the social and environmental impacts of existing major&#13;
facilities (which are not contemplated in the 1DB program); and&#13;
(d)    prepare action plans that include:&#13;
(i)  studies and mitigation measures for existing major facilities&#13;
(including responsibilities, budgets and timetables);&#13;
(ii)  monitoring/evaluation on a regular basis to measure baseline&#13;
parameters; and&#13;
(iii)  training for EHRC and CEL staff, as needed, to carry out&#13;
environmental assessments and management activities.&#13;
4.15   In a Statement of Energy Policy presented to the Bank (Annex 8.1) GOES&#13;
confirmed its commitment to execute the SEA. The recommendations of the study will&#13;
be given in two phases. The first will analyze the existing legislation and institutions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
and will review existing power installations. The second phase will prepare the&#13;
instruments for improved environmental management in the sector: EA methodologies&#13;
and procedures, emission and environmental quality standards and a monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system. The SEA will be completed by December 31, 1995. The Bank&#13;
and GOES will discuss the Action Plan which is expected to be implemented promptly&#13;
following the conclusion of the study. Its implementation will be discussed with the&#13;
Bank not later than June 30, 1996. The SEA is to be funded by the TAL; however, if&#13;
there is any shortfall in funds, the proposed project will provide the balance.&#13;
V. CEL'S MANAGEMENT AND FINANCES&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
5.1    Oversight of CEL's operations is the responsibility of the Ministry of&#13;
Economy, though with the significant involvement of other ministries. External&#13;
borrowing is approved by the Ministry of Planning, the annual budget by the Ministry&#13;
of Finance and rate increases by the Ministry of Economy. The President of the eight&#13;
member Board of Directors is appointed by the Minister of the Interior. The Board&#13;
approves major investment plans, borrowing proposals and corporate policies, and&#13;
recommends tariff changes to the government.&#13;
5.2    CEL's financial management is the responsibility of the Finance Department,&#13;
which is headed by the Financial Director. Accounting and control functions are well&#13;
developed. Current policies and procedures are weighted to controlling cash operating&#13;
budgets and satisfying the reporting requirements of the Corte de Cuentas (Court of&#13;
Accounts). Internal auditing supports these control procedures by carrying out ex-ante&#13;
audits of expenditures. Other financial management functions are less well developed.&#13;
Treasury functions are non-existent, as are general asset and liability management.&#13;
Cash management, investments, and risk and exposure analysis are undertaken in only&#13;
a limited way. Some financial management systems are under development, e.g. fixed&#13;
assets, inventory and management accounting.&#13;
B. Financial Performance&#13;
5.3    Past performance. (See Annex 5.2 for details) During the 1980s and early&#13;
1990s, CEL encountered operating difficulties that led to significantly diminished&#13;
financial performance. Real average tariffs declined throughout the 1980s. The civil&#13;
strife caused severe damage to transmission installations, devaluations of the colon&#13;
added to the burden of servicing CEL's long-term debt and reduced earnings, and in&#13;
1991 and 1992 fuel expenses increased nearly seven-fold over the previous two years&#13;
as a result of a severe drought which restricted hydro generation. CEL also had prob-&#13;
lems collecting revenue from the power distribution companies and other major&#13;
clients, which led to deteriorating liquidity. As a result, during this period CEL relied&#13;
heavily on short-term debt and revenues from the commercialization of imported&#13;
petroleum to finance its operating and capital budgets, and on central government&#13;
transfers to remain solvent. The government restructured CEL's long term debt in&#13;
1990, helped settle overdue accounts receivable from the distribution companies and&#13;
assumed its debt service obligations to the international financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Additionally, the government financed oil purchases in 1991 and 1992, and peri-&#13;
odically provided interest-free, short-term working capital loans.&#13;
5.4    By the start of the decade, the government had recognized that tariff&#13;
adjustments were essential to CEL's financial recovery. Thus, in 1991 and 1992 rates&#13;
were increased significantly though their impact on net income was masked by the&#13;
dramatic increase in fuel purchases due to the prolonged drought. A modest profit was&#13;
recorded in 1994. Other signs of an improved financial situation have emerged in&#13;
recent years: income from operations has increased significantly, and liquidity has im-&#13;
proved due to better internal cash generation and the mobilization of external loans.&#13;
The government is committed to continue to address the tariff issue and has agreed,&#13;
under the terms of a loan with the Inter-American Development Bank, to increase&#13;
tariffs to reach 85% of LRMC by 1996, and, under an agreement with the Bank for&#13;
this project, to raise tariffs to 100% of LRMC by 1999. Bringing rates into line with&#13;
LRMC, though it will require annual increases over the next five years, will address&#13;
the most immediate financial needs of CEL (see para. 5.9 and Annex 5.5).&#13;
5.5    Projections. Based on these tariff assumptions, and projections of growth in&#13;
demand and improved operating efficiency, CEL's finances will improve steadily from&#13;
1995 to 1999. Enhanced profitability will yield an average annual rate of return on&#13;
net fixed assets of 7% (Table 5.1). Demand is expected to increase from 2,816 GWh&#13;
in 1994 to 3,605 GWh in 1999, an average annual growth rate of about 5%. CEL's&#13;
operating expenses will shift also, with a greater reliance on purchased power. Also,&#13;
in 1994 the government instituted a value added tax that, for CEL, currently functions&#13;
as an additional operating expense. CEL is obliged to pay the tax but is unable to pass&#13;
it on to its clients'. CEL's improved profit margins and the magnitude of the&#13;
payments allow it to absorb the impact of the tax. However it is petitioning the&#13;
government to redress the situation. The favorable profit projections will also lead to&#13;
a considerably strengthened financial structure. Total assets will expand rapidly in the&#13;
initial years, principally due to additions to the physical plant; overall, total assets will&#13;
grow by 15% per year through 1999. Shareholder equity, which was negative in&#13;
1990, will grow by about 12% per year during 1995-1999. Government additions to&#13;
shareholder equity will end in 1995. The overall flow of funds will improve&#13;
gradually but the composition will shift away from government support and towards&#13;
greater internal cash generation and loans.&#13;
5.6    Financial management efficiency indicators will improve. CEL expects its&#13;
collection rate on accounts receivable will drop to 40 days in 1995 and decline&#13;
gradually thereafter. This target seems optimistic, but because CEL has reached&#13;
agreement on the resolution of longstanding amounts due from the distribution&#13;
companies and is essentially a wholesaler of power, an improved accounts receivable&#13;
collection rate is well within its capacity. Inventory turnover has also improved, from&#13;
187 days in 1989 to 59 days in 1994, and is forecast to remain in this region through&#13;
to 1999.&#13;
1. VAT is also currently not applied to water, sewerage, financial services, and the bulk of&#13;
construction activities. Broadening the VAT base is part of a wider dialogue on taxation&#13;
revenue issues being conducted between the Bank and GOES.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
5.7     CEL's projections contemplate significant investments over the next five&#13;
years. Most of the foreign cost components of the investments will be financed by&#13;
external borrowing, through multilateral and bilateral agencies. Though the level of&#13;
external debt is projected to increase significantly over the next five years, it is within&#13;
CEL's capacity to incur this debt due to higher profits and internal cash generation.&#13;
Its debt management indicators are within the targets of the Performance Plan agreed&#13;
with the Bank (see para. 6.19 and Annex 5.4). CEL's current long term debt is most-&#13;
ly held by development banks, with an average cost of just under 7%, on fixed terms&#13;
and with an average maturity of 18 years. Future borrowing is expected to be on&#13;
similar terms, except for a shift to variable interest rates. The investment program,&#13;
however, includes some projects that may be financed by the private sector (in&#13;
generation) and an allowance (around 5%) for investment in rural distribution&#13;
networks. Under the new framework for the distribution sector, the government may&#13;
make direct contributions to the expansion of distribution networks in areas that are&#13;
not commercially attractive and it is therefore unlikely to continue to be an obligation&#13;
that CEL will bear. For these reasons the investment program should be considered a&#13;
pessimistic estimate of the investments that CEL will undertake, and one that could be&#13;
curtailed in the event of an unexpected decline in internal cash generation.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
5.8    Risks. (See Annex 5.5 for details) Both external and internal factors pose&#13;
risks to the successful implementation of CEL's financial plan. Although CEL's risk-&#13;
management strategies are still relatively undeveloped, these risks can be mitigated&#13;
and CEL has initiated discussions with an international commercial bank on the&#13;
management of financial risks. In addition, CEL's modernization of existing capacity&#13;
will significantly enhance efficiency and contribute to greater profit margins, thus&#13;
providing more capacity to absorb risks. CEL's own financial structure carries three&#13;
additional elements of risk: (a) interest rates. More than half the value of the long&#13;
term debt will be on variable terms by 1995 and a 1 % increase in interest rates would&#13;
cause net income to drop by 2%; (b) exchange rates. CEL's financial projections take&#13;
into account currency devaluations on the order of 3 % -4% per year. A further 5 %&#13;
devaluation of the colon in any year during the projection period would reduce income&#13;
by about 3%; and (c) fuel supply. Recognizing this, CEL has managed to somewhat&#13;
stabilize fuel purchases through an annual contract with a local supplier. While the&#13;
price is about 30% greater than the average import price, it is significantly less&#13;
volatile than the prices CEL paid for imported diesel fuel. Many power companies&#13;
have a similar risk structure, especially when revenues are not denominated in the&#13;
same currency as borrowings and fuel purchases. In the case of CEL, risks of this&#13;
magnitude are manageable in the light of it's projected improved financial structure.&#13;
In the event of much larger swings in interest rates, exchange rates or fuel prices,&#13;
CEL would have to curtail its investment program to offset these impacts. The Bank&#13;
will be reviewing progress on implementation of the investment program under the&#13;
project.&#13;
5.9    At the sector level, the introduction of IPPs adds a competitive risk previously&#13;
unknown to the power sector in El Salvador. A failure to attract IPPs could mean&#13;
higher investments for CEL (paras. 5.5 and 5.7). Without sufficient resources, this&#13;
could delay the construction of generating capacity and thus translate into CEL&#13;
making expensive energy purchases or shedding load. Private sector interest in the&#13;
sector has been high, however, and the first contract with an IPP has been signed (see&#13;
para. 2.12). In the event of a deterioration in interest by the private sector, CEL may&#13;
need to adjust its investment program. However, the new IPPs (additional to those&#13;
envisaged being undertaken by the private sector in CEL's expansion program, see&#13;
Annex 5.1) are relatively far in the future (see Annex 5.3). CEL would therefore&#13;
have the opportunity to revise its investment program to accomodate the new&#13;
investment requirements. Another possibility is that highly successful IPPs could win&#13;
market share, and leave CEL with excess capacity and diminished rates of return.&#13;
However, this risk is low because CEL's generation is mainly from hydro and&#13;
geothermal plants, which have small incremental cost and should be priority&#13;
dispatched. A second external risk is that posed by a delay or outright cancellation of&#13;
tariff increases. Without such increases, CEL's rates of return would be unacceptable&#13;
and its long term viability in doubt. A failure to increase tariffs above present levels&#13;
would turn CEL's finances negative, leading to average annual rates of return of -1 %&#13;
over the next five years. Under this situation, CEL's long term expansion plan would&#13;
not be viable. A one-year delay in the implementation of tariff targets would reduce&#13;
annual profits over 1995-1999 by one third. This could lead to CEL reducing the&#13;
scale of its investment program. The recently-elected government, however, has&#13;
declared it commitment to continued tariff adjustments (para 5.4) and reform of the&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VI. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
6.1    The proposed project will support the government's objectives for the power&#13;
sector, which are: (a) to improve service reliability and increase coverage by&#13;
rehabilitating, modernizing and expanding power generation, transmission, sub-&#13;
transmission and distribution systems; and (b) to assist in the restructuring of the&#13;
sector's legal and regulatory framework through the preparation of secondary&#13;
legislation and procedures, and to support the EHRC and NEC when their respective&#13;
laws are enacted. At the same time the government is introducing policies to promote&#13;
environmentally sound investments and operating procedures by establishing project&#13;
guidelines and quality standards and by strengthening management and enforcement&#13;
capacities.&#13;
B. The Power Sector Investment Program&#13;
6.2    The Energy Sector Modernization Project is a part of the 1995-1999 time slice&#13;
of the GOES's Power Sector Investment Program. This Program includes the&#13;
following components (see Annex 6.1 for more details):&#13;
(a)    Studies and technical assistance related to the rehabilitation of existing&#13;
generating plants and transmission and distribution equipment, to the development of&#13;
geothermal resources, to the optimal expansion of the network and of generation, to&#13;
CEL's planning and management activities and the environment. A Sectoral&#13;
Environmental Assessment and an action plan will be carried out;&#13;
(b)    Renovation and modernization of existing power plants and installation&#13;
of 200 MW of new generating capacity, of which at least 80 MW would be developed&#13;
by the private sector;&#13;
(c)    Renovation of existing transmission and distribution facilities, damaged&#13;
during the civil war, and construction of new transmission lines and expansion of&#13;
distribution systems; it is envisaged that this will add 900 km of new and rehabilitated&#13;
line to the transmission network . The telecommunications and central load control&#13;
systems will also be renewed and reinforced.&#13;
6.3    At the end of 1999, the implementation of the Power Sector Investment&#13;
Program would result in an expansion of the power sector highlighted below:&#13;

6.4   In conjunction with the investment program, GOES is also embarking on a&#13;
program of structural and institutional reform for the power sector, with the objective&#13;
to: (a) facilitate and encourage private sector participation in generation; (b) regulate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
concession procedures and the pricing of monopolistic transmission and distribution&#13;
activities; (c) create an environmental framework for the power sector, including&#13;
privately funded generation projects; (d) create new planning and regulatory&#13;
institutions (NEC and EHRC) and trust to the Ministry of Economy and other&#13;
governmental institutions the oversight of energy and environmental activities;&#13;
(e) privatize the power distribution companies; (f) restructure CEL to accommodate&#13;
the sectoral regulatory and institutional changes envisaged; and (g) improve CEL's&#13;
administrative, financial and environmental management capacity.&#13;
6.5    Under the Power Sector Investment Program, energy conservation will be&#13;
promoted through: (i) a reduction in losses on the distribution network; (ii) an&#13;
increase in the operational efficiency of generating plants; (iii) an improvement in the&#13;
reliability of supply; and (iv) a restructuring of, and an increase in, electricity tariffs&#13;
to bring them into line with economic costs.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
6.6    The proposed Energy Sector Modernization Project includes the following&#13;
components (Annex 6.2):&#13;
Part A: Studies and Technical Assistance. (US$9.4 million including contingencies&#13;
or 10% of total project cost). This includes:&#13;
(a)    Energy Sector Restructuring. MIPLAN will coordinate this&#13;
component; this would involve technical assistance and studies to (i)&#13;
prepare secondary legislation and/or regulations/decrees for the power&#13;
sector to implement the Electricity Law (including private sector&#13;
participation in generation and access to the transmission and&#13;
distribution grids); and (ii) assistance in the implementation of EHRC&#13;
and NEC and to develop their operational capabilities, including the&#13;
provision of training to their personnel. Financing of this will be&#13;
subject to the passage of the respective laws establishing the EHRC&#13;
and NEC (paras. 2.12 - 2.16).&#13;
(b)    Power Sector Restructuring. CEL and MIPLAN will coordinate this&#13;
component; this would include: (i) defining the role for CEL under the&#13;
framework provided by the new Electricity Law and to assist CEL in&#13;
restructuring, where necessary; and (ii) assistance in encouraging&#13;
further private sector participation in generation.&#13;
(c)    Engineering Studies and Training. To be developed by CEL with the&#13;
assistance of consultants: (i) feasibility studies for the two most&#13;
promising hydroelectric projects (under consideration are the El Tigre,&#13;
Paso del Oso, San Marcos Lempa and El Zapotillo schemes); (ii) the&#13;
detailed design and technical specification for the expansion of the&#13;
Cerron Grande hydro plant; (iii) a detailed feasibility and design study&#13;
for the rehabilitation of the Guajoyo hydroelectric station; (iv) studies&#13;
of the environmental impacts of the Guajoyo, 15 de Septiembre, 5 de&#13;
Noviembre and Cerron Grande power stations; (v) the improvement of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
CEL's information and telecommunications systems; and (vi) the&#13;
training of CEL's staff in technical, financial and managerial&#13;
techniques.&#13;
Part B. Rehabilitation, Modernization and Expansion of Hydroelectric Plants.&#13;
(US$75.2 million including contingencies, or 81 % of total project cost). This&#13;
involves the following:&#13;
(a)    " 5 de Noviembre" (81.4 MW installed capacity): the project will&#13;
support the refurbishment, modernization and upgrading of the power&#13;
station and its substation, in particular the turbine runners, guide&#13;
vanes and covers, generator voltage regulators, turbine speed&#13;
governors, control panels and protection equipment. The base cost of&#13;
this rehabilitation is expected to be US$19.1 million;&#13;
(b)    "Cerr6n Grande" (135.0 MW): the project will support the&#13;
refurbishment and modernization of the station control and supervisory&#13;
system. At present, the lack of an adequate control and supervisory&#13;
system causes unreliable operation of the plant and high water and&#13;
energy losses. The base cost of this rehabilitation is US$2.7 million;&#13;
(c)    "Guajoyo" (15.0 MW): this station consists of one unit (commissioned&#13;
in 1962) which is presently subject to frequent outages due to its&#13;
outdated operating systems. The project will support the&#13;
refurbishment of the plant, substituting its generation control systems&#13;
to increase plant availability and reduce forced outages and energy&#13;
losses. The base cost is estimated at US$4.7 million;&#13;
(d)    installation of a third unit at "Cerr6n Grande" (67.5 MW): The&#13;
existing station consists of two 67.5 MW units; during the first phase&#13;
of construction the bulk of the civil works to allow the addition of&#13;
third and fourth units were put into place. Therefore the project will&#13;
finance the installation of a turbine and generator (67.5 MW) and&#13;
some more minor civil works. The base cost of this is estimated at&#13;
US$30.9 million; and&#13;
(e)    sedimentation control equipment: CEL is in the process of&#13;
undertaking a study, funded by the Power Sector TAL, on siltation&#13;
problems at these hydroelectric stations (arising as a result of&#13;
deforestation and soil erosion in the Lempa River valley). This&#13;
component of the project will provide for the purchase of equipment&#13;
required for the control of sedimentation and siltation at these sites,&#13;
and is expected to total US$3.0 million (base cost).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Part C. Modernization of CEL's Telecommunications and Information Systens.&#13;
(US$7.9 million including contingencies, or 9% of total project cost). This&#13;
component includes the modernization of:&#13;
(a)    CEL's telecommunication system: the telecommunications system for&#13;
control of the interconnected power system is now obsolete, and in&#13;
addition was seriously damaged during the civil war. The project will&#13;
support the repair and substitution of the analogic microwave system,&#13;
composed of a digital microwave network and line carrier networked&#13;
for the El Salvador-Guatemala interconnection, a VHF-UHF radio&#13;
system covering the interconnected system and a telephone system&#13;
connected to the microwave network; this will provide CEL with a&#13;
system adequate for the operation of the national system, at an&#13;
estimated base cost of US$3.1 million; and&#13;
(b)    CEL's information system: this will include the purchase and&#13;
installation of required computer hardware and software; the estimated&#13;
base cost of this is US$3.2 million.&#13;
D. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
Cost and Financing of the Power Sector Investment Program&#13;
6.15   The five year time slice (1995-1999) of the Power Sector Investment Program&#13;
would have a total cost of US$ 896 million (see Annex 6.1), of which 67% would be&#13;
invested in generation, 14% in transmission, 11 % in distribution, 7% in studies and&#13;
1% in other investments. Financing would be provided by: (a) IBRD and&#13;
EXIMBANK under the proposed Energy Sector Modernization Project which has a&#13;
cost of US$101.2 million and is 11.3% of the cost of the five year time slice; (b) IDB&#13;
under two already approved projects which together cover US$293 million or 33 % of&#13;
the program; (c) CEL with its own resources; (d) the private sector for IPP&#13;
generation and for investments in rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution&#13;
system; and (e) by other co-financiers (including OECF).&#13;
Cost of the Bank Financed Project&#13;
6.16   Details of the proposed Energy Sector Modernization Project are shown in&#13;
Annex 6.2, and are summarized below in Table 6.1.&#13;
E. Project Implementation&#13;
6.17   Project Financing. Total financial requirements for the proposed Energy&#13;
Sector Modernization Project, including interest during construction and duties and&#13;
taxes are US$101.2 million, of which 87% are foreign currency. The proposed Bank&#13;
loan of US$65.0 million would finance 64% of total cost. CEL would finance&#13;
US$16.2 million (16%) from its own resources and the remaining US$20 million&#13;
(20%) would be financed by EXIMBANK of Japan. This loan would follow&#13;
procedures for the Japan Accelerated Cofinancing Facility under which the Bank&#13;
would supervise procurement and disbursements to CEL, with the same procedures as&#13;

the Bank loan. The Borrower of the proposed Bank and EXIMBANK loans would be&#13;
the Republic of El Salvador, and CEL and the Ministry of Planning (MIPLAN) will&#13;
be the Beneficiaries. Procurement procedures of the EXIMBANK loan will be&#13;
according to Bank guidelines. The combined Bank and EXIMBANK loans will cover&#13;
about 96% of total foreign currency costs. The Bank loan will finance 100% of the&#13;
cost of consultants for studies, technical assistance and training (including the cost of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
office equipment)2 and 67% of the costs of goods and works required for the&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion of the hydroelectric stations and for the rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of the telecommunications and information systems (see para 6.26).&#13;
Out of the proposed Bank loan, US$3.0 million would remain with GOES to cover&#13;
the costs of the technical assistance to be managed by MIPLAN, and US$62.0 million&#13;
would be on-lent to CEL. The full amount of the EXIMBANK loan would be on-lent&#13;
to CEL. On-lending terms for both loans would have the same terms as the loans to&#13;
the Government. CEL will service the subsidiary loans and bear the interest rate and&#13;
foreign exchange risks.&#13;
6.18   Executing Agencies. MIPLAN will be the executing agency for the&#13;
component related to technical assistance, restructuring CEL, organizing the planning&#13;
and regulatory agencies and supervising the execution of the SEA, through the inter-&#13;
governmental coordination body UES. CEL will be the executing agency for the&#13;
technical assistance component related to supporting engineering and plant-specific&#13;
environmental studies and for the rehabilitation of the hydroelectric plants and of the&#13;
modernization of the telecommunication systems.&#13;
6.19   Project Monitoring. The following actions would be monitored by MIPLAN&#13;
and by the Bank during project implementation: (a) GOES should develop the energy&#13;
sector as defined in the Policy Letter provided to the Bank; (b) the new planning and&#13;
regulatory institutions (NEC and EHRC) should be implemented and that these&#13;
institutions should operate in the manner currently envisaged under their draft laws;&#13;
(c) the Power Distribution Plan should be executed as planned and completed during&#13;
the implementation period of the project; (d) an Environmental Action Plan, to be&#13;
recommended by the SEA, should be executed as agreed; (e) CEL's Performance Plan&#13;
(Annex 5.4) should be implemented as agreed; and (f) the strategy for tariffs during&#13;
the transitory period prior to EHRC's normal operation should be implemented as&#13;
agreed, if the pertinent legislation is enacted.&#13;
6.20   Accounts and Audit. The Borrower and CEL will establish and maintain&#13;
project accounts for all expenditures financed under the loan. The special account as&#13;
well as the project accounts and records pertaining to goods and services financed&#13;
under the loan, will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, and the audit reports submitted within four months after the close of the fiscal&#13;
year. CEL's financial statements would be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, and the audit reports submitted within four months after the&#13;
close of CEL's fiscal year.&#13;
F. Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
6.21   A country procurement assessment was carried out for El Salvador in 1990.&#13;
In general, Borrower's procurement regulations are compatible with Bank policies.&#13;
Particularly, CEL, which will be the executing agency for most of procurement, has&#13;
substantial experience in procurement including experience with Bank Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents. In addition, a procurement and disbursement workshop will be&#13;
2. With the proviso that the Bank will finance 85% of the costs of locally procured imported&#13;
items for this category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
carried out as part of a project launch seminar. Procurement of the proposed Bank&#13;
and EXIMBANK loans will follow Bank Guidelines for Procurement of goods and&#13;
works (published in January 1995), and Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants. To&#13;
the extent feasible and practicable, procurement of goods and works will be done in&#13;
bid packages costing respectively the equivalent of at least US$250,000 and&#13;
US$500,000 or more per package. In the case of rehabilitation of hydroelectric&#13;
plants, contracts estimated to cost more than US$8 million may be executed under the&#13;
"turn-key" modality, with pre-qualification of bidders.&#13;
6.22   Procurement of Goods. A margin of preference for national goods shall be&#13;
granted in accordance with the Bank guidelines on procurement. Bids estimated to&#13;
cost more than US$250,000 will follow ICB procedures. Contracts for foreign&#13;
manufactured goods (including office supply and equipment, vehicles and data&#13;
processing equipment) estimated to cost between US$100,000 and US$250,000 will be&#13;
procured through limited international competitive bidding (LIB). Contracts for&#13;
foreign manufactured goods costing less than US$100,000, not exceeding US$500,000&#13;
in aggregate, will be procured through international shopping. Contracts for locally&#13;
manufactured goods estimated to cost between US$25,000 and US$250,000, will be&#13;
procured under national competitive bidding procedures (NCB) up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$500,000. Goods costing less than US$25,000 per contract, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$500,000, may be procured under contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of national shopping procedures, in accordance with the guidelines. All ICB,&#13;
LIB and the first two NCB procurement packages will be subject to the Bank's prior&#13;
review in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
6.23   Procurement of Civil Works. Procurement of civil works estimated to cost&#13;
the equivalent of US$500,000 or more will be done following ICB procedures.&#13;
Contracts estimated to cost less than US$500,000 up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$2.5 million equivalent will be procured through NCB procedures satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank. All ICB bids and the first two NCB bids would be subject to the Bank's&#13;
prior review. These prior review requirements for works, along with those for goods,&#13;
would cover 97% of the total value of Bank-financed contracts.&#13;
6.24   Selection and Contracting of Consultants. Consultants are required for&#13;
institutional strengthening, engineering design, studies, supervision of works and&#13;
training. These services will be contracted in accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
Contracts with individual consultants with a maximum estimated value of US$50,000&#13;
and contracts with consulting firms, with an estimated value of less than US$100,000&#13;
would not be subject to prior review, and only the terms of reference will be subject&#13;
to prior review. For all other consulting services, terms of reference, qualifications&#13;
of the proposed consultant, and the draft contract will require prior Bank approval.&#13;
For complex, time-based assignments, consultants will be retained under contracts&#13;
using the Bank's standard form and contract for consultant services (Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency).&#13;
6.25   Summary of Procurement Method. Table 6.2 summarizes procurement&#13;
arrangements for the project. Details are shown in Annex 6.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
6.26   Disbursement. The project would be financed in part with funds from the&#13;
proposed loan (US$65 million) and cofinancing from EXIMBANK (US$20 million).&#13;
The proceeds would be disbursed over a five year period (1995-1999) according to the&#13;
schedule shown in Annex 6.4. The closing date would be June 30, 2000. As shown in&#13;
Annex 6.5, the proposed Bank financing would be disbursed against:&#13;
(a)    100% of currency expenditures for consulting services for studies and&#13;
for technical assistance, including training and office equipment for&#13;
NEC and EHRC (however, the Bank would finance only 85% of&#13;
locally procured imported items, principally office equipment, under&#13;
this category); and&#13;
(b)    67% of expenditures for goods and civil works needed for the&#13;
rehabilitation of hydro plants, and for the modernization of CEL's&#13;
telecommunications and information systems.&#13;
6.27   Disbursements for: (a) goods contracts valued less than US$250,000&#13;
equivalent; (b) civil works and erection contracts valued less than US$500,000&#13;
equivalent; and (c) consulting service contracts below US$100,000 for consulting&#13;
firms and US$50,000 for individuals, will be made against certified statements of&#13;
expenditures (SOEs) prepared by CEL. Supporting documentation for the SOEs will&#13;
not be sent to the Bank, but will be retained by CEL for inspection by Bank staff&#13;
during supervision missions. All other disbursements will be fully documented. To&#13;
expedite project execution, a Special Account in U.S. dollars will be established in the&#13;
Central Bank of El Salvador with an authorized allocation of US$4 million equivalent,&#13;
estimated to cover the average amount equivalent to four months of eligible&#13;
expenditures that are expected to be paid from the account. A condition for&#13;
disbursement for consultants services (for studies and technical assistance) for power&#13;
and energy sector restructuring shall be the passage of the NEC Law, the EHRC Law&#13;
and the Electricity Law, and the establishment of the NEC and the EHRC to the&#13;
satisfaction of the Bank.&#13;
6.28   Expenditures for eligible project equipment, materials and consultancy&#13;
services incurred by CEL and MIPLAN since April 1, 1995, under contracts resulting&#13;
from advanced actions and awarded with prior Bank approval, will be eligible for&#13;
retroactive financing under the proposed loan up to US$6 million equivalent. This&#13;
retroactive financing will be used to finance consultant support for GOES and CEL&#13;
for implementing the sector restructuring program and preparing final engineering&#13;
designs for investments to be funded by the project. It will also be used to anticipate&#13;
urgent up-grading needed by power plants and facilities.&#13;
G. Environmental Impacts&#13;
6.29   Substantial environmental benefits are expected from the execution of the five&#13;
year time slice of the Investment Program and of the proposed Energy Sector&#13;
Modernization Project. There are no negative social or environmental impacts&#13;
resulting from project activities, because most components involve sector restructuring&#13;
and modernization of existing equipment. The benefits will stem from: (a) energy&#13;
saved by generation efficiency gains, which would, although on a small scale,&#13;
&#13;

project would help CEL and other sector entities, mitigate eventual environmental&#13;
impacts in existing equipment, incorporate sound criteria in its long term planning,&#13;
and improve its capacity to assess environmental impacts and implement mitigation&#13;
programs.&#13;
H. Lessons Learned from Bank Operations&#13;
6.30    Regional experience in the power sector shows that the most pervasive&#13;
problems arise from inadequate sector policies, weak institutions, political interference&#13;
and unsound pricing policies. The ongoing TAL project has enabled the Bank to build&#13;
a constructive dialogue with GOES and the energy and power sectors on these issues,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
and the proposed project would continue it, in the expectation that it would lead to&#13;
sustainable achievements. The investment component of the proposed project would be&#13;
executed mainly by CEL, which has a good project implementation record (the Fifth&#13;
and Sixth Power Projects and the Ahuachapan Project were rated as satisfactory by&#13;
the Bank's audits and PCRs, and the Power Sector TAL Project is being efficiently&#13;
carried out). However, CEL has no experience in dealing with environmental action&#13;
plans, and has at times had problems using the Bank's new mandatory standard&#13;
documents for procurement. Further, although UES has gained experience in quality&#13;
control techniques (through the sectoral studies of the Power Sector TAL), it is not an&#13;
implementing agency with the capacity to face political and union opposition to the&#13;
sector's restructuring, which includes privatization programs. Moreover, in terms of&#13;
decision making, it is inefficient, as representatives must consult with Ministers about&#13;
each option.&#13;
6.31   To solve the problems, GOES and CEL have agreed to the following:&#13;
(a) GOES would provide more decision-making power to UES, appointing as its&#13;
Director a person empowered to carry out the energy sector reforms and privatization&#13;
programs; (b) CEL's environmental capabilities would be strengthened through an on&#13;
going program funded by IDB; (c) GOES is committed to implement sectoral reforms&#13;
and electricity rates in line with economic costs; (d) CEL's capability in financial and&#13;
commercial management, including the negotiation of PPAs, would be improved by&#13;
technical assistance provided by the proposed loan; and (e) a project launch seminar&#13;
would be held to improve CEL's staff skills for carrying out Bank procedures on&#13;
procurement and disbursement.&#13;
VIl. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
7.1     Efficient development of the power sector is critical for the future of El&#13;
Salvador's economy. The Bank is uniquely placed to provide the support needed as a&#13;
result of the work undertaken on the Power Sector TAL. The proposed project would&#13;
help El Salvador: (a) increase power sector efficiency by refurbishing existing&#13;
facilities, allowing the system to serve consumers that are currently without&#13;
electricity; (b) continue legal and institutional reforms in the energy sector; and&#13;
(c) undertake engineering studies for future projects. The technical assistance&#13;
components related to energy and power sector restructuring will only go forward if&#13;
the relevant legislation (Electricity Law, EHRC Law and NEC Law) is passed and the&#13;
EHRC and NEC are established to the Bank's satisfaction. However, the Bank's&#13;
involvement in the sector via this project would be justified in the event that these&#13;
technical assistance components (which represent around 4% of project costs) do not&#13;
go forward, because of the great need for investment to modernize and rehabilitate&#13;
existing generation facilities.&#13;
7.2    The country assistance strategy (CAS) was discussed in conjunction with the&#13;
Board presentation of the SAL II on September 17, 1993. The proposed project is&#13;
fully consistent with the CAS and the Bank's strategy for lending operations in the&#13;
energy sector. The project focuses on improving sectoral efficiency and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
productivity of existing facilities, and expanding the role of the private sector. Bank&#13;
presence is essential to help the government and CEL prepare legislation, restructure&#13;
the sector and execute the privatization program. In addition, the Bank can play a&#13;
catalytic role in securing and coordinating cofinancing for future operations, and&#13;
reducing private investors' perceptions about risks.&#13;
B. Project Benerits&#13;
7.3    The technical assistance components of the project can be expected to bring&#13;
substantial benefits to the sector, in terms of strengthening the capabilities of CEL and&#13;
other existing government entities involved in the energy sector, as well as providing&#13;
support to the new bodies to be created under the GOES's legislative program and&#13;
assisting the GOES in furthering the restructuring of the sector. In conjunction with&#13;
the proposed project, CEL is undertaking a Sectoral Environmental Assessment,&#13;
which will help introduce environmental considerations into management and planning&#13;
activities in the sector. Although these benefits can be expected to be substantial, they&#13;
have not been quantified. Economic appraisal has been undertaken for the (a)&#13;
rehabilitation and modernization of the hydroelectric stations; and (b) addition of a&#13;
third unit at Cerron Grande. The benefits of the modernization and rehabilitation of&#13;
the telecommunications and information systems are not quantified given the inherent&#13;
difficulties and uncertainties in this. Annex 7.1 presents the assumptions and working&#13;
details for the economic analysis.&#13;
7.4    As far as the 1995-1999 time slice of the Power Sector Investment Program is&#13;
concerned, expansion of the power system would allow the connection of an&#13;
additional 185,000 consumers by 1999, so that 68% of the population (4.2 million)&#13;
will have access to electricity compared to 61 % in 1993. The rehabilitation of existing&#13;
facilities would reduce network losses and improve generating plant efficiency,&#13;
allowing some additional energy to be served without increasing production. Finally,&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion of the system will also improve the reliability and quality&#13;
of service, reducing the incidence of unserved energy. The investments in this&#13;
program are part of the least cost expansion plan for the system (see Annex 3.5 and&#13;
paras. 3.8 and 3.9), modified to include the expansion of Cerron Grande. The Bank&#13;
has reviewed the least cost plan prepared by CEL in conjunction with the consultants&#13;
MONENCO-Agra Inc, as well as the modified scenario including Cerron Grande 3&#13;
and has found the analysis to be satisfactory.&#13;
C. Economic Justification&#13;
Rehabilitation of the Hydroelectric Stations&#13;
7.5    The scope of this proposed component is rehabilitation and modernization of&#13;
the " 5 de Noviembre", "Cerr6n Grande" and "Guajoyo" stations.&#13;
7.6    Annex 7.1 presents details on the methodology and assumptions used. In each&#13;
case it is assumed there is an incremental O&amp;M cost associated with the investment.&#13;
The inclusion of this is debatable as the refurbishment may actually lead to an overall&#13;
decrease in O&amp;M costs. Therefore results have been calculated with and without the&#13;
estimated incremental O&amp;M costs. The increase in energy from the station is valued at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
a forecast of the bulk supply tariff, with returns being evaluated over the economic&#13;
life of the equipment.&#13;

7.7    Table 7.1 below presents estimates of the economic internal rate of return&#13;
(EIRR) and the net present value (NPV) associated with the project (evaluated using a&#13;
discount rate of 12%). These are 12.6% and US$0.14 million for Guajoyo; 25.1%&#13;
and US$17.35 million for 5 de Noviembre; and 34.1% and US$2.20 million for&#13;
Cerron Grande. Excluding the incremental O&amp;M costs (see para. 7.6) increases the&#13;
EIRRs and NPVs, in the case of Guajoyo to 14.1 % and US$0.52 million.&#13;
7.8    The main project risks relate to capital costs being higher than anticipated and&#13;
the incremental output from the stations being lower than forecast. Table 7.1 presents&#13;
sensitivity estimates based upon variations in these factors. The EIRRs/NPVs are less&#13;
sensitive to changes in the capital costs than to changes in the incremental output&#13;
provided by the rehabilitation. The sensitivity analysis shows that returns from the&#13;
rehabilitation works at 5 de Noviembre and Cerron Grande are robust, with EIRRs&#13;
3.The choice of the bulk supply tariff, rather than tariff to final consumers less losses at the&#13;
distribution network, reflects the vertically disaggregated framework for the sector envisaged&#13;
by the Government in the Electricity Law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
being above 12% for all cases considered. Guajoyo, which at 15 MW is the smallest&#13;
of the stations being rehabilitated (representing 6% of the capacity being rehabilitated&#13;
and less than 6% of overall project cost) is more marginal. The rehabilitation works&#13;
at Guajoyo would provide an increase in output of approximately 20% over present&#13;
levels. The factor that is most likely to cause incremental output to be lower than&#13;
anticipated would be inadequate maintenance, which would reduce the overall&#13;
performance of the plant. However, reductions in forecast output in the range of 15%&#13;
would require a reduction of similar magnitude in availability and plant capability.&#13;
This in turn would imply that maintenance would be dramatically below required&#13;
levels. This situation may arise if CEL were to find itself in very difficult financial&#13;
circumstances (for example, if the planned tariff increases in 1996 and 1999 are not&#13;
implemented, see para. 5.9). However, the relatively low O&amp;M costs (on average)&#13;
for hydroelectric generation, for example as compared to thermal generation means&#13;
that maintenance of these plant will not require major financial resources from CEL.&#13;
Drought conditions could temporarily suppress output from the station. However, the&#13;
assets being invested in under the project have lives of between 10 and 20 years,&#13;
under which an averaging of hydrological conditions would take place.&#13;
Addition of a Third Unit at the Cerron Grande Hydroelectric Station&#13;
7.9    Although the expansion of Cerron Grande was not originally part of the least&#13;
cost expansion plan, CEL has undertaken some analysis to produce a modified plan&#13;
including this scheme (see Annex 3.5 and para 3.9). This shows that the total costs of&#13;
expansion with Cerron Grande 3 are less than 0.4% greater than the strict least cost&#13;
plan. The increase in investment costs are almost completely offset by the savings in&#13;
operating costs and in the expected cost of unserved energy. The scheme has&#13;
additional merits because it would provide the system with additional peaking power,&#13;
system reserve and insurance in case other schemes envisaged in the plan are delayed.&#13;
The relative simplicity of this project (the civil works for the project are already in&#13;
place) means that it is an ideal scheme for providing such insurance.&#13;
7.10   Within the time frame being examined, the alternative to expanding Cerron&#13;
Grande would be to construct a gas turbine, because the scheme will provide peaking&#13;
power and system reserve. An economic appraisal has been undertaken comparing&#13;
these two alternatives. Detailed methodology and assumptions are presented in Annex&#13;
7.1. The expansion of Cerron Grande would involve higher capital costs, but lower&#13;
O&amp;M cost than the combustion turbine unit as well as fuel cost savings.&#13;
7.11   The results of the comparison are presented in Table 7.2 below. These show&#13;
that the expansion of Cerron Grande would yield an EIRR of 19.4% if the benefits&#13;
are represented by the cost savings over the costs of the combustion turbine unit. On&#13;
this basis, the NPV would be US$4.55 million. This indicates that the addition of&#13;
peaking power is better met by the addition of Cerron Grande 3 than with a&#13;
combustion turbine. The robustness of this is shown by the results of scenarios&#13;
reflecting 20% higher O&amp;M costs and capital costs for Cerron Grande 3 as well as&#13;
lower availability (of 80% for Cerron Grande 3). It should be noted that the cost&#13;
estimate for Cerron Grande 3 already includes a 15% allowance for physical&#13;
contingencies and that the extent of civil works on this project is quite limited.&#13;

D. Project Risks&#13;
7.12   The investment components of the project, rehabilitation and expansion of&#13;
hydroelectric and modernization of the telecommunications and information systems&#13;
do not contain any unusual technical difficulties. Risks of slow implementation will be&#13;
mitigated by the requirement that CEL appoint a Project Director to head a Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (paragraph 8.2) to ensure smooth project implementation.&#13;
Although the GOES is strongly committed to the legislative program (Electricity Law,&#13;
NEC Law and EHRC Law), there is a possibility that the laws may not achieve&#13;
passage through Congress in a manner acceptable to the Bank. Under the project,&#13;
passage of the legislation and taking of the necessary subsequent actions for the&#13;
establishment of the NEC and EHRC will be conditions for disbursement against&#13;
expenditure for all technical assistance components related to energy and power sector&#13;
restructuring (see para. 8.6). The legislative package has been developed in extensive&#13;
consultation with the Bank, and the GOES's commitment to sector reform reduce the&#13;
risk that the package will not be passed in an acceptable form. The legislation is part&#13;
of wider sectoral reforms (see para. 7.14).&#13;
7.13   The main risk to viable economic returns for the rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of the existing hydroelectric stations is that the increase in output&#13;
attributable to the rehabilitations will not be as high as anticipated. Sensitivity&#13;
analysis (see Table 7.1) shows that this is a concern for the smallest plant, Guajoyo&#13;
(representing 6% of the capacity being rehabilitated and modernized under the&#13;
project). This in turn is most likely to be caused by inadequate maintenance which&#13;
would reduce overall plant availability. However overall plant availability would have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
to fall substantially in order to produce large reductions in the anticipated increase in&#13;
output (para. 7.8). On the financial side, the main risk is that tariff increases will not&#13;
be implemented as planned (see para. 5.9). If tariffs are not increased from present&#13;
levels, then CEL would face increasing losses over the next five years and be unable&#13;
to fund its planned investment program. A slippage of one year of the planned tariff&#13;
increases would reduce profits and force CEL to delay part of the investment&#13;
program. If the tariff increases are applied as planned, then CEL will enjoy increased&#13;
profit margins; although its external debt is forecast to rise substantially, CEL's&#13;
higher profit and internal cash generation will allow it to bear this increased debt.&#13;
The Government's commitment to aligning tariffs with marginal costs, as shown by&#13;
the recent tariff increases (see para. 2.9) and by agreements reached under this loan&#13;
(see para. 5.4) reduce the extent of this risk. The Bank will be reviewing CEL's&#13;
investment plan on a semi-annual basis (see para. 8.4). Beyond the risks associated&#13;
with tariffs, CEL, like other electric power utilities, must manage risks related to&#13;
currency and interest rates and fuel supply costs. These risks, however, will be&#13;
manageable with higher projected profit margins and better cash generation and&#13;
through strengthened financial risk management procedures (see paras. 5.8 and 5.9).&#13;
7.14   As far as success in achieving the project objectives is concerned, the actions&#13;
of GOES to date have shown that it is strongly committed to reform of the power&#13;
sector and substantial progress has already been made. In 1994 Congress passed&#13;
legislation authorizing the privatization of the distribution companies. CEL has&#13;
presented to the President of El Salvador a plan for the privatization of this sector.&#13;
CEL has also contracted with an independent power producer for 80 MW of power,&#13;
due to be on-line by mid 1995. This, together with the agreements reached between&#13;
the Borrower and the Bank and CEL and the Bank (see paras. 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4), show&#13;
the strength of commitment to reform.&#13;
VIII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED&#13;
8.1    Satisfactory understandings were reached with GOES and CEL on major&#13;
sectoral policy issues, particularly on the legal, institutional, environmental, technical&#13;
and pricing aspects. The Bank has discussed these subjects with IDB and the&#13;
objectives and content of their US$ 225 million loan for the Programa de Desarrollo&#13;
Elctrico 11J (Electric Development II Program), approved in December 1994, have&#13;
been coordinated with the proposed ESM project. Conditions for the operation are&#13;
given below.&#13;

EL SALVADOR&#13;
ENERGY SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Least Cost Expansion Plan for the Electricity Sector&#13;
1. CEL, working with the consultants MONENCO-Agra Inc., has developed a least cost expansion&#13;
plan for the El Salvador power system for the period 1995 to 2010 (see Annex 9.1). The plan, which&#13;
takes as its starting point the forecasts of sales, losses and energy and power requirements presented&#13;
in Annex 3.4, was developed using the generation expansion model SUPER which uses a probabilistic&#13;
approach. Under the base case forecasts, energy requirements are expected to grow at 4.8% from&#13;
1995 to 2000, and thereafter at 4.7%. An expected improvement in the load factor over the period&#13;
to 2000 results in a lower forecast growth in power requirements (4.1 %) in the first five years of the&#13;
plan.&#13;
2. Existing Capacity. Out of existing installed capacity of 817.5 MW on the interconnected system,&#13;
available capacity is at present 704 MW. Of this, 278 MW (40%) is thermal capacity, 378 MW&#13;
(54%) in hydroelectric with the remainder being geothermal (48 MW, or 7%). CEL is currently&#13;
undertaking a program of rehabilitation and modernization of a number of its existing facilities; this&#13;
will add 97 MW of firm capacity to the system. The schedule for this, along with the expected&#13;
addition of capacity is as follows:&#13;
1995  Repowering of Soyapongo Gas Turbine      55 MW&#13;
Stabilization of Ahuachapan I (Geothermal)   5 MW&#13;
1996  Stabilization of Ahuachapan 2 (Geothermal)   7 MW&#13;
Rehabilitation of Acajutla 1&amp;2 (Steam)   -&#13;
1997  Stabilization of Ahuachapan 3 (Geothermal)  10 MW&#13;
1998  Stabilization of Ahuachapan 4 (Geothermal)  20 MW&#13;
In addition, CEL has contracted to purchase 80 MW from an independent power producer, Nejapa&#13;
Power, scheduled to start production in late 1995.&#13;
3. Candidate Plants. The following options were considered as candidate plant:&#13;
a. Hydroelectric: expansion of 5 de Noviembre (120 MW) and Cerron Grande (67.5 MW); new&#13;
schemes at El Tigre (351 MW), Paso del Oso (74 MW); San Marcos (56 MW) and Zapotillo&#13;
(103 MW);&#13;
b. Geothermal: Berlin - option of 2 x 27.5 MW or I x 55 MW; Berlin Phase 11 (27.5 MW); San&#13;
Vicente (27.5 MW), the latter representing a new site;&#13;
c. Thermal: Coal-Fired Steam (75 MW, 100 MW and 150 MW units); Oil-Fired Steam (75 MW,&#13;
100 MW and 150 MW units); Combined Cycle at Acajutla (110 MW); Combined Cycle&#13;
options of 115 MW and 150 MW; Diesel Units of 60 MW (medium and low speed);&#13;
d. Gas Turbine: units of 35MW, 80 MW and 100 MW.&#13;
&#13;

For each of these, assumptions regarding capital costs, operations and maintenance costs and&#13;
operating efficiency were developed. These are described in greater detail in the report prepared by&#13;
MONENCO-Agra Inc., "Actualizacion del Plan de Expansion del Sistem de Generacion" (see Annex&#13;
9.1).&#13;
4. Additional Planning Assumptions:&#13;
a. Fuel Price Projections: the World Bank projections (dated June 1994) of international coal and&#13;
oil prices were used in the study;&#13;
b. Value of Unserved Energy: in the range of 0% - 2% the cost used is US$0.35/kWh; above&#13;
this level, a value of US$0.80/kWh was used; this reflects the greater economic disruption&#13;
associated with an increased volume of unserved energy;&#13;
c. Quantity of Unserved Energy: the plan was developed so that on average unserved energy&#13;
would represent less than 1 % of net generation;&#13;
d. Reserve Margin over Peak Demand: although this criteria was not used explicitly in the&#13;
modelling, CEL would typically ensure that the expansion plan provided a firm reserve&#13;
margin of at least 20% over peak demand.&#13;
5. Least Cost Expansion Plan. The least cost expansion plan is shown in Table A3.2. Of the&#13;
hydroelectric candidates, only the expansion of the 5 de Noviembre scheme is selected for the plan.&#13;
Expansion of the geothermal system (Berlin - 2 x 27.5 MW) is envisaged as well, but the bulk of&#13;
capacity additions are envisaged to be coal-fired steam units of 150 MW. On the basis of preliminary&#13;
studies of hydrology, output and cost, the new hydro schemes in 3.a. above were not selected as part&#13;
of the least cost plan. However, it is possible that they would be part of the expansion program with&#13;
a more accurate definition of their potential and costs. Accordingly, the proposed Energy Sector&#13;
Modernization Project (ESMP) would fund feasibility studies for two of the most promising hydro&#13;
schemes in 3.a. above. This may lead to a redefinition of their costs and output, and based on this,&#13;
subsequent expansion studies might select these plant as part of a least cost expansion program.&#13;
6. Expansion Plan with Cerron Grande Unit 3. The addition of a third unit at Cerron Grande does&#13;
not appear in the strict least cost expansion plan. However, this project would provide the system&#13;
with additional peaking capacity and reserve, and would provide insurance against delays in other&#13;
projects selected for the expansion plan. The civil works for the third unit at Cerron Grande are&#13;
already in place, having been completed as part of an earlier phase of development. CEL has&#13;
undertaken a comparison, using the SUPER model, of the costs of system expansion with and without&#13;
the Cerron Grande Unit 3 in 1998, presented in Table A3. 1. This shows that the inclusion of this&#13;
scheme would produce savings in system operating cost and the expected cost of unserved energy that&#13;
would almost outweigh the capital costs of the scheme, the increase in total expansion costs therefore&#13;
being less than 0.4%. This, combined with the simplicity of the project and the insurance it would&#13;
provide against delays in the envisaged least cost expansion scheme, indicate that the addition of the&#13;
third unit at Cerron Grande would assist in making the expansion plan more robust. It is intended that&#13;
the proposed ESMP finance the expansion of Cerron Grande.&#13;

Introduccidn&#13;
1.    La Repdblica de El Salvador estA preparando el Proyecto Modernizaci6n del Sector&#13;
Energfa (MSE), el cual se espera financiar con fondos del Banco Mundial y otras agencias&#13;
financieras internacionales. Como parte de la preparaci6n del Proyecto MSE, es necesario&#13;
disponer del estudio Evaluaci6n de Medio Amnbiente del Sector Electrico (EMASE), cuyos&#13;
alcances y terminos de referencia se indican en los parrafos siguientes.&#13;
2.     El propuesto Proyecto MSE tiene como finalidad modernizar el sector energfa,&#13;
apoyandose en los resultados de los estudios que estAn siendo elaborados como parte del&#13;
Proyecto de Asistencia Tecnica al Sector Electrico (PATSE), el cual tambien estA siendo&#13;
financiado por el Banco Mundial. La modernizacidn deseada se pretende obtener mediante las&#13;
siguientes actividades principales:&#13;
a) reestructuraci6n del marco institucional, legal y regulador del sector energfa&#13;
(subsectores electricidad e hidrocarburos), mediante la promulgaci6n de leyes y&#13;
aplicacion de medidas organizacionales y administrativas;&#13;
b) apoyo a la participaci6n privada en el sector energfa, orientado principalmente a:&#13;
(i) la reprivatizaci6n de las empresas de distribuci6n electrica; (ii) el desarrollo de&#13;

EL SALVADOR&#13;
ENERGY SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Financial Information&#13;
Financial Models&#13;
1.    CEL's planning and financial projections are based on models in use at CEL&#13;
since 1991. Projections for this Staff Appraisal Report were prepared in December 1993&#13;
and, updated in October 1994 and April 1995. Generation and other capital expenditures&#13;
are derived from an investment plan that is based on dry hydrological conditions and&#13;
contemplates private sector participation in projects coming on-stream in 1995 (80MW)&#13;
and 1997 (IOMW). Sales are forecast to grow at 5% p.a. over the next five years. Both&#13;
the investment plan and sales projections are updated at least annually.&#13;
2.     Average inflation and exchange rates are as follows (the projections are relatively&#13;
pessimistic but reflect conservative assumptions):&#13;
Actual                            Projected&#13;
1989   1990  1991  1992  1993  1994  1995  1996  1997   1998/99&#13;
lnflation(%)     17.6  24.0  14.4  11.2  17.3    7.0   9.0   9.0   8.0           8.0&#13;
Exch.Rate         6.5   7.6   8.1   8.4   8.7    8.75  9.4   9.8   10.0         10.5&#13;
(colones x US$)&#13;
Note: 1994 figures are estimates.&#13;
Load Forecast&#13;
3.     CEL's load forecast is based on an analysis of recent sales, surveys of main&#13;
industrial users, and long and short term elasticity of demand estimates. This forecast is&#13;
described in detail in Annex 3.4.&#13;
Accounting Policies&#13;
4.     CEL follows El Salvador's generally accepted accounting principles, which are&#13;
in line with internationally recognized norms. Financial statements are audited by an&#13;
internationally recognized firm that is appointed by CEL's Board of Directors. The&#13;
auditors' opinions have been qualified in recent years for: (i) inventory control (1992)&#13;
and (ii) fixed asset valuation (1991). CEL has changed its method of fixed asset valua-&#13;
tion to bring it in line with generally accepted accounting principles, and has initiated a&#13;
program to address deficiencies in inventory management. In some cases historical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
financial information has been re-stated in later externally audited financial statements.&#13;
The historical information presented here is the re-stated figures.&#13;
Statement Of Financial Results&#13;
5.     Tariff Revenues. The proposed sector restructuring will lead to liberalization of&#13;
power tariffs and rates. During the period 1995-1999, however, tariffs will be regulated&#13;
by the new regulatory agency. Also, beginning in 1994, automatic rate adjustments are&#13;
permitted for changes in exchange rates and international oil prices. After 1999, tariffs&#13;
and rates will be market determined and based, partially, on long term contracts with&#13;
independent power producers or individual consumers. CEL's financial projections&#13;
assume rates reaching 85% of LRMC by 1996, and move towards 100% of LRMC in&#13;
subsequent years. The projections also assume that CEL's structure of sales will remain&#13;
the same as that prevailing in 1994.&#13;
6.     Other Revenues. These are projected to be negligible throughout the period.&#13;
With improved financial prospects and a liberalized financial sector, treasury operations&#13;
within CEL could begin to contribute a greater share of total revenues, especially in the&#13;
latter part of the projection period (1994-1998) when cash balances are improved.&#13;
7.     Energy Losses and Plant Factors. Total energy losses in generation average&#13;
17.4% (of which 3.1 % is plant consumed). Transmission losses are currently 5.8%, and&#13;
are projected at 5.7% during the projection period.&#13;
Operational Expenses&#13;
8.     Fuel. Fuel will represent about 25% of operating expenses per year on average.&#13;
The fuel quantity and cost are estimated from the results of an optimization model of the&#13;
existing and projected generating plans and the load factor of each plant. Oil prices are&#13;
as follows:&#13;
Actual                   Projected&#13;
l______    1993      1994    1995    1996    1997    1998&#13;
Diesel   0.717    0.734   0.740   0.773   0.808   0.844&#13;
Bunker   0.378    0.387   0.389   0.406   0.422   0.440&#13;
Note: 1994 figures are estimates.&#13;
9.     Power Purchase Contracts. CEL will have the option of signing long term&#13;
contracts with independent power producers. The first such contract was for an 80MW&#13;
plant, to come on-stream in 1995. Contracts will be for 20 years, will be dollar&#13;
denominated, and will be on a take or pay basis. During this projection period (1995-&#13;
1999) CEL is assumed to have 2 such contracts for 80MW and 10MW. Alternatively,&#13;
IPPs can sell directly to individual clients. The projections assume that IPPs sell to CEL.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
10.   Personnel. CEL currently has 3300 staff, of whom 470 are professional/technical&#13;
staff. This staffing is acceptable for past operations, but a reduction has been assumed&#13;
for the projection period because the decrease in security staff (because of the achieved&#13;
peace) and private participation in power generation. CEL's labor force is unionized and&#13;
a contract is negotiated every year. Negotiations normally focus on wages, benefits and&#13;
work rules. The union does not have a seat on the CEL Board of Directors. Professional&#13;
and technical staff wages are governed by public sector wage laws.&#13;
11.   Depreciation. CEL's fixed assets were revalued in 1991 and 1992. The average&#13;
depreciation rate is forecast at 2.74% p.a., using a straight line method.&#13;
12.   Taxes. CEL is exempt from income taxes and pays only VAT (which was&#13;
instituted in late 1994) on some goods and services. It is not permitted, however, to&#13;
collect VAT on its sales. These taxes are therefore treated as operating expenses in the&#13;
financial projections and are included in individual line items.&#13;
13.   Financial Expenses. These represent interest charges to CEL. In 1990 they&#13;
include a foreign exchange loss of 343 million colones.&#13;
Flow of Funds: Sources&#13;
14.   Internal. The very strong profit performance between 1995 and 1999 leads to&#13;
equally robust internal cash generation (Annex 5.3).&#13;
15.   Government. Government support will cease in 1995.&#13;
16.   Donations and Other. Donations refer mainly to the rural electrification program&#13;
supported by USAID. Other sources of funds refer to the collection of certain accounts&#13;
receivable from the distribution companies.&#13;
17.   Loans. CEL's debt includes official donors, bilateral loans and smaller bridge&#13;
loans from commercial banks, mainly in dollars. Future borrowing are expected to be&#13;
under the same terms and conditions as the current portfolio.&#13;
Flow of Funds: Uses&#13;
18.   Debt Service. Because the terms and conditions of CEL's debt portfolio are not&#13;
expected to change significantly, the grace periods on CEL's most recent borrowing&#13;
would still be in effect during the period 1995-1999. This, combined with strong cash&#13;
generation would lead to better debt service coverage ratios. The targets given in CEL's&#13;
projections and Performance Plan are relatively conservative, based on improved profit&#13;
performance and stronger cash flow. In addition, the financing requirements for the&#13;
investment program represent a relatively pessimistic estimate of CEL's investment&#13;
obligations.&#13;
19.   Investment Program. CEL's investment program is based on an indicative sector&#13;
expansion plan that excludes private producers, and includes investment in rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
electrification. It is therefore a relatively pessimistic projection of CEL's investment&#13;
obligations. The expansion plan seeks to redress the very low levels of investment during&#13;
the years of conflict. Over the next five years (1995-1999) the average annual investment&#13;
undertaken by CEL (1,477 million colones) would be about four times greater than the&#13;
previous five years (330 million colones). Under the new sector structure CEL and&#13;
independent power producers will compete for projects, thus investments may be lower&#13;
than projected here (CEL could also be obligated to undertake a project in the event no&#13;
private producer submits an acceptable bid). Also, under the new structure for the&#13;
distribution sector, the GOES is to make direct investment contributions to build&#13;
electricity grids in rural areas.&#13;
Statement of Financial Position&#13;
20.   Fixed Assets and Revaluation. A revaluation was completed in 1991 and 1992.&#13;
Under El Salvadoran accounting rules assets can be revalued annually. CEL is currently&#13;
incorporating an automated system for calculating revaluations.&#13;
21.   Accounts Receivable. CEL has devoted considerable effort to reducing accounts&#13;
receivable. In 1992 it reached agreement with the central government on accounts&#13;
receivable from other government institutions. The goal of 40 days turnover is reached&#13;
in 1995, and turnover rates will improve gradually thereafter.&#13;
22.   Cash &amp; Short Term Investments. CEL's policy is to maintain at least two&#13;
months of operating needs.&#13;
23.   Notes Payable. These reflect short term borrowing denominated in colones.&#13;
Between 1989 and 1992 they included short term loans from the central government.&#13;
24.   Shareholders Equity. Government support increased fivefold between 1989 and&#13;
1994. Additional support is expected in 1994 and 1995, but in subsequent years&#13;
shareholder's equity is expected to change essentially only due to increased retained&#13;
earnings.&#13;

PROYECTO MODERNIZACION DEL SECTOR ENERGIA&#13;
PLAN DE DESEMPENO DE CEL&#13;
1.    ANTECEDENTE.  La Junta Directiva de CEL, que representa al Gobiemo y a la&#13;
Administraci6n de CEL, entidad Gubernamental, responsable del Subsector Electrico, ha acordado&#13;
el Plan de Desempefio Financiero e lnstitucional que se anexa, que permita medir la eficiencia del&#13;
Sector sobre el tiempo. Este Plan contiene valores de objetivos conjuntos para un horizonte de&#13;
cuatro anios y los indicadores seleccionados y definidos serviran para evaluar la productividad&#13;
administrativa, financiera y tecnica de CEL. A mas tardar el 31 de marzo de cada aiio, CEL&#13;
preparara un informe cumpliendo con el Plan, el cual el Consejo de Direcci6n examinara a mas&#13;
tardar el 30 de abril de cada ado. en este momento el Consejo puede decidir corregir el valor y/o la&#13;
definicion del indicador. corregir problemas especificos del Sector y continuar la urgencia por&#13;
mejorar el desempefio de CEL.&#13;
2.     Las siguientes definiciones seran utilizadas para el calculo de los diferentes indicadores:&#13;
(a)   MWH vendidos por empleado. Total de Mwh facturados entre Enero I y diciembre 31&#13;
del respectivo afio, divididos por el numero de empleados a Junio 30 del mismo ano.&#13;
(b)   Periodo Medio de Cobranza. Saldo de cuentas por cobrar vencidas o no descontada la&#13;
provision para cuentas de dificil cobro a Diciembre 31 de ese afio y multiplicado por&#13;
365.&#13;
(c)   Tasa de Rentabilidad. Ingreso neto de explotacion entre Enero I de un ano y diciembre&#13;
31 del mismo afio, dividido por el Activo Fijo Neto en operaci6n durante el aino. Este&#13;
uiltimo calculado como el promedio del activo fijo neto en operaci6n a Diciembre 31 del&#13;
aiio y el valor correspondiente al 31 de Diciembre del anlo inmediatamente antenor.&#13;
(d)   Tarifa Promedio/Costo Marginal. Las tarifas promedio de venta de CEL, calculadas&#13;
segutn lo indicado en el punto anterior, dividida cada una por el costo marginal&#13;
promedio al respectivo nivel de entrega de la energia. La tarifa promedio total se divide&#13;
por el costo marginal promedio ponderado.&#13;
(e)   Tarifa Promedio de CEL (ctsUS$/kWh). Se refiere a la facturacion total de energia&#13;
entre Enero I y Diciembre 31 para cada categoria de usuarios atendidos por CEL y el&#13;
agregado total, dividido por los respectivos kWh facturados en el mismo periodo. Estas&#13;
tarifas deberan ser expresadas en US$ dividiendolas por el tipo de cambio a Junio 30&#13;
del respectivo afio.&#13;
(f)   Margen de operacion %. Ingreso neto de explotaci6n entre enero I de un afio y&#13;
Diciembre 31 del mismo aflo, despues de descontados los gastos de operaci6n incluida&#13;
la depreciaci6n, dividido por los ingresos totales de operaci6n en el mismo periodo.&#13;
(g)   Cobertura del servicio de la deuda. Generaci6n intema bruta de fondos entre Enero 1&#13;
de un anio y Diciembre 31 del mismo afio, dividida por el servicio de las deudas, el cual&#13;
&#13;

incluye las amortizaciones al capital y los gastos financieros, sin incluir los gastos&#13;
financieros financiados con recursos del mismo prestamo.&#13;
(h)    Contnrbuci6n a inversiones (veces). La generaci6n interna neta de fondos entre Enero I&#13;
de un afio y Diciembre 31 del mismo afio, dividida por el monto total de inversiones.&#13;
incluidos los gastos financieros capitalizados. Se entiende por generaci6n intema neta&#13;
de fondos para un aiio dado, la generaci6n interna bruta de fondos entre Enero I y&#13;
Diciembre 31 del mismo aiio, descontado el servicio de las deudas en el mismo periodo;&#13;
este ultimo incluye las amortizaciones al capital y los gastos financieros, sin incluir los&#13;
gastos financieros financiados con recursos del mismo prestamo.&#13;
(i)    Coeficiente de Endeudamiento (veces). Relaci6n entre las deudas a largo plazo a&#13;
Diciembre 31 de un afio d el patrimonio de la entidad a la misma fecha.&#13;
(j)    Perdidas de Energia de CEL%. Energia disponible de CEL menos energia facturada&#13;
entre Enero I y Diciembre 3 1, divididas por la energia disponible. La energia&#13;
disponible incluye la energia generada mas las compras de energia, menos los consumos&#13;
propios de las plantas.&#13;

ENERGY SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
CEL's Financial Risks&#13;
1.    Tariffs, exchange rates, interest rates, and power purchase agreements with IPPs each pose&#13;
financial risks for CEL during 1994-1998. The exposure they create could affect income, cash flow and&#13;
financial structure. However, the new structure in the power sector will provide CEL with the&#13;
opportunity to manage its risks. For example, during the period in which the ERC sets prices, CEL's&#13;
financial risks can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher rates. Once prices are market&#13;
determined, CEL may not be able to do this and must thus be prepared to manage these risks. Although&#13;
CEL's risk-management strategies are still relatively undeveloped, some discussions have taken place&#13;
with an international commercial bank to identify potential actions. In addition, as it modernizes&#13;
existing capacity, this will significantly enhance efficiency and contribute to greater profit margins, thus&#13;
providing more capacity to absorb risks.&#13;
2.    Tariffs Risk. CEL's most critical financial risk, which depends entirely on government action,&#13;
is associated with a delay or outright cancellation of tariff increases. The latter would turn CEL's&#13;
finances decidedly negative, increasing losses over the next five years and leading to average annual&#13;
rates of return of about -1 %. Under these circumstances, CEL's long term expansion plan would not be&#13;
viable. A one-year delay would reduce projected annual profits over 1995-99 by one third, and lead to&#13;
an average annual rate of return of only 5%. However, this risk is unlikely because the former&#13;
government has already authorized a rate increase and the recently-elected government has declared it&#13;
will continue to liberalize the economy.&#13;
3.    Exchange  Rates  Risk.  CEL's    Estimated Impact of the Colon Depreciation&#13;
principal exchange rate exposure is through&#13;
its long-term  external debt, which, as of                    (1995)&#13;
December 31, 1993 was heavily weighted&#13;
toward US dollars (about 53%): nine of 29      Financial       Depreciation Amount&#13;
loans in the portfolio are denominated solely  Statement&#13;

predominant. CEL's  financial projections   flow&#13;
contemplate currency devaluations on the     LoT debt         I        1% 2w&#13;
order of 3 %-4%  per year. Additional,&#13;
adverse currency fluctuations would affect&#13;
CEL's annual financial performance. For&#13;
example, a further 5% devaluation of the&#13;
colon in 1995 would require an additional 14 million colones to service the external debt and would&#13;
reduce earnings. If CEL's debt structure were to remain the same, however, future devaluations would&#13;
have less of an impact as profit margins are expected to be larger. The currency-hedging instruments&#13;
available to CEL are limited, due to the lack of a market for colon-dollar transactions; thus, CEL's&#13;
principal option is to create a dollar reserve fund to offset, even partially, the risk exposure. Moreover,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

once the agreed automatic mechanism for tariffs adjustment is approved, this risk could be transferred&#13;
to customers.&#13;
4.    Fuel Supply Risk. In 1993 about 37% of CEL's total expenses were for fuel purchases. While&#13;
these are projected to decline to about 30% over the next five years, fuel supply will still represent a&#13;
major source of financial risk.  There are four dimensions of this risk: price volatility in the&#13;
international oil market; year-to-year fluctuations in CEL's overall demand for petroleum fuels due to&#13;
hydrological variations'; fluctuations in the colon value of imported fuels caused by changes in&#13;
exchange rates2; and fluctuations in domestic or international refiners' margins. The sensitivity to a&#13;
10% change in each of these factors, under normal and dry conditions, is high (Table A5.2).&#13;
Recognizing this, CEL has managed to somewhat stabilize fuel purchases through an annual contract&#13;
with a local supplier.&#13;

5.    Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The introduction of independent power producers&#13;
implies added dimensions of financial risk. At the sector level, a failure to attract IPPs would mean that&#13;
the expansion plan would have to be adjusted; and, under such a scenario, CEL would be obliged to un-&#13;
dertake additional projects. This could delay the construction of generating capacity and thus translate&#13;
into CEL making larger energy purchases -which are limited by current contracts- or shorten the&#13;
energy supply. Another possibility is that highly successful IPPs could win market share, and leave&#13;
The demand for diesel fuel increases by 135% under dry conditions while the demand&#13;
for bunker varies by only I %.&#13;
2  Eighty percent of fuel purchases are denominated in dollars and the remainder in colo-&#13;
nes.&#13;

CEL with excess capacity and diminished rates of return. However, this risk is low because CEL's&#13;
generation is mainly from hydro and geothermal plants, which have small incremental cost and should&#13;
be priority dispatched. The first power purchase agreement (PPA) was signed for an 80 MW project&#13;
(coming on-line in 1995), and future PPAs that likely will be negotiated on a similar basis, contain&#13;
additional financial risk for CEL: payment is likely to be made to the IPP in dollars on a take-or-pay&#13;
basis; changes in fuel prices are likely to be passed to CEL by the IPP in the form of an energy price&#13;
escalation formula; and the capacity charge component of the power price is likely to be indexed to the&#13;
LIBOR rate, or other international interest rate indicator, thus adding variable interest rate exposure.&#13;
However, these risks will be passed on to consumers. Tables A5.3 to A5.5 below illustrate this&#13;
scenario.&#13;

Lessons Learned in the Implementation of&#13;
Energy Projects in Central Arnerica and El Salvador&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The World Bank has been involved in projects in Central America since 1949,&#13;
and has provided significant support to the power sector development. One-third of&#13;
loan to the region were for the power sector, as shown below:&#13;

2.    Mainly because of macroeconomic issues, the Bank participation in the power&#13;
sectors of Central America slowed down at the end of the 1970s and at the beginning&#13;
of the 1980s. Lending operations for power stopped in 1979 for Costa Rica (Sixth&#13;
Power), in 1976 for El Salvador (Ahuachapan Expansion), in 1986 for Guatemala&#13;
(Power Distribution), in 1980 for Honduras (El Cajon IDA credit), in 1977 for&#13;
Nicaragua (Ninth Power) and in 1983 for Panama (Seventh Power)'. The lending&#13;
hiatus finally was reversed in 1991 for El Salvador (Technical Assistance Loan) and&#13;
Honduras (Energy Sector Adjustment Loan). The Bank cancelled the undisbursed&#13;
Power Distribution Loan of Guatemala in 1993, and recently has initiated a dialogue&#13;
with Nicaragua to support the modernization of the power sector, jointly with the&#13;
IDB, as a part of the Government efforts to restructure the economy.&#13;
The Seventh Power Loan was approved in 1985, but cancelled without disburse-&#13;
ment in 1990.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 6.6&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
3.    The Bank participated actively in lending operations to the Power Sector in El&#13;
Salvador from 1949 (a US$12.6 million loan was approved for funding the Rio Lempa&#13;
Hydro Power Plant) until 1981, when the Seventh Power Project -funding the&#13;
expansion of the Ahuachapan geothermal plant- was completed. A ten-year absence&#13;
from the country followed, interrupted only by the financing of the earthquake&#13;
reconstruction project in 1987, because no agreements were reached with the&#13;
Government on major macroeconomic issues. From 1989 new macroeconomic&#13;
policies were adopted, which helped to re-initiate a dialogue with the Governrment. In&#13;
this year, the Government introduced a comprehensive economic stabilization and&#13;
modernization program which relies on market forces and private participation to&#13;
promote sustained social and economic development. Simultaneously, efforts to reach&#13;
peace and programs to alleviate poverty were initiated.&#13;
4.     Economic policy measures taken by the Government since then, supported by&#13;
an IMF stand-by arrangement approved in August 1990, a Bank Structural Adjustment&#13;
Loan (SAL I) approved in February 1991, a follow-up IMF stand-up arrangement&#13;
approved in January 1992, and a SAL I1/TAL approved in August 1993, resulted in&#13;
important achievements: (a) the GDP, whose real growth was 1.5% per year in the&#13;
1985-1989 period, increased by 3.4% in 1990, 3.5% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992 and&#13;
5.1% in 1993; (b) real exports, which had been decreasing 11 % per year in the 1985-&#13;
1989 period, increased by 8.7% in 1990, 11.4% in 1991, 20.8% in 1992 and 11.8%&#13;
in 1993; and (c) inflation, which had average 23.5% in the 1985-1990 period,&#13;
decreased to 9.9% in 1991, 19.9% in 1992 and about 12.0% in 1993.&#13;
5.    In addition, the fiscal deficit, which stood at 4.2% of GDP in 1989, was&#13;
almost eliminated in 1990; and even though it increased to 2.5% in 1991 and 4.1% in&#13;
1992, it decreased again in 1993 to 1.8%. The deficit in 1991 was due fundamentally&#13;
to the increase in public expenditures caused by social programs. In 1992, the non-&#13;
financial public sector deficit was due mainly to: (i) an increase in the operating&#13;
deficit of the electric utility company (CEL), in part resulting from a prolonged&#13;
drought and low rates; (ii) expenditure overruns associated with a compensation&#13;
scheme for coffee producers; and (iii) unanticipated expenses related to the 1992&#13;
Peace Accord. Tax reforms (VAT) and an increase in public services rates approved&#13;
in September 1992 led to increased fiscal revenues, consequently reducing the fiscal&#13;
deficit, and lowering inflation. Expectations for 1994 are to have a fiscal deficit no&#13;
higher than 1.8% of GDP, and an inflation of about 8%. Nevertheless, this depends&#13;
on measures that are being taken by the new recently elected administration which&#13;
took office in June 1994.&#13;
6.    The past lending program for power sectors in Latin America, Central&#13;
America and El Salvador has taught the Bank important lessons which are presented&#13;
in the following paragraphs. The information was obtained from: (i) two OED reports&#13;
(Fifth and Sixth Power Projects); (ii) a PCR (Ahuachapan Expansion Project); (iii)&#13;
LA2IE's paper "Central America and Panama-Power Sector Strategy Paper" of&#13;
October 1991; (iv) LATIE's report "The Evolution, Situation and Prospects of the&#13;
Electric Power Sector in LAC" of August 1991; and (v) Bank files on El Salvador's&#13;
power sector (SAR, back-to-office reports, etc.).&#13;

The Bank's contribution to the power sector&#13;
7.     One credit and eight loans were made to El Salvador for the power sector,&#13;
amounting to US$109.0 million (Table 2). The first five loans (US$52.7 million)&#13;
helped develop: (a) the Lempa River and its tributaries; and (b) the geothermal field at&#13;
Ahuachapan. A credit (US$6.3 million) helped finance the Soyapango gas turbine&#13;
plant. Two additional loans (US$39.0 million) helped fund the Ahuachapan&#13;
geothermal power plant and its expansion. The latest loan (US$11.0 million)&#13;
-granted at the end of 1991- is being used to finance Technical Assistance required&#13;
by the Government and CEL to carry out studies for the restructuring the energy&#13;
sector and engineering studies aiming an improving of the physical efficiency of the&#13;
power sector.&#13;

4 As of December 31. 1993&#13;
8.     All the works financed by the credit and the first seven loans granted to El&#13;
Salvador were completed satisfactorily. OED's audit reports for the Fifth and Sixth&#13;
Power Projects (Credit 227-ES and Loan 889-ES) show that the projects were&#13;
completed satisfactorily, with minor delays but with about 35% cost overruns, due to&#13;
underestimation of civil works costs and weakness of the US dollar in relation to other&#13;
currencies (particularly because most of the equipment was purchased from Japanese&#13;
suppliers). OED's PCR for the Seventh Project (Loans 1288-ES and 1289-ES) rated&#13;
the performance of the project satisfactory and indicated that the physical goals of the&#13;
project were met, but with 47% cost overruns due to substantial increases in&#13;
exploration drilling of geothermal fields. More importantly, OED concluded that due&#13;
to adverse economic and political developments -concurrent with the 1979 coup-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
Annex 6.&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
the Government failed to implement electricity rate increases and prevented CEL from&#13;
complying with financial covenants.&#13;
9.     During the execution of the projects the Bank identified the following issues:&#13;
(a) need to improve the legal, institutional and regulatory framework; (b) need to&#13;
improve the electricity pricing method; (c) need to encourage private participation;&#13;
and (d) need to improve CEL's efficiency (planning, engineering, project execution&#13;
and financial procedures). These issues are being addressed under the ongoing Power&#13;
TAL and the proposed new operation is designed to assist the Government and CEL&#13;
in the implementation of the recommendations from such studies.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
10.    Legal, Institutional and Regulatory Framework. As for most developing&#13;
countries, El Salvador lacks a suitable legal, institutional and regulatory framework,&#13;
and this is perceived to stand in the way of expanded private sector participation. It&#13;
also results in excessive Government interference in utility management and&#13;
politization of key decisions (regarding rates and hiring and firing of personnel).&#13;
These deficiencies were analyzed under the Power TAL project and a detailed&#13;
restructuring program was prepared by international consultants based on:&#13;
(a) removing from CEL energy policy formulation, regulation and electricity tariff&#13;
setting functions; (b) creating a high-level inter-ministerial institution in charge of&#13;
energy policies and preparing sector legislation; (c) creating an independent regulatory&#13;
institution responsible for the application of current regulations to public and private&#13;
power companies; and (d) liberalizing the energy sector to increase competitiveness.&#13;
The proposed ESM project would help the Government to define these measures and&#13;
assist it in their implementation.&#13;
11.    Electricity Pricinz. Most of the Bank's borrowers in the power sector have&#13;
experienced financial problems due to inadequate electricity pricing, often handled by&#13;
the Govermnent based on political considerations. Low electricity rates and high&#13;
external debt service have become the main cause of poor financial performance of&#13;
utilities in the region and also in El Salvador. Rates for bulk and retail sales have con-&#13;
tinuously declined. Tariffs were last increased by the Government in June 1994, by&#13;
30%, reaching approximately 70% of LRMC. Under the proposed loan the&#13;
Government has agreed to increase tariffs to reach 85% of marginal costs by 1996 and&#13;
100% of marginal costs by 1999.&#13;
12.    Managerial and Financial Aspects. In a great number of developing countries&#13;
the power sector has failed to perform efficiently, providing poor service and&#13;
becoming a drain on public finances due to a weak sector organization, political&#13;
interference in utility operations and poor management of electricity companies.&#13;
However, the Salvadoran power sector performance is quite acceptable considering&#13;
the turmoil that the country has faced, as the electricity coverage has become the third&#13;
highest in the region (61 % in 1993). Moreover, CEL has the highest number of&#13;
customers by employee, ranks second in energy sales by employee and has the lowest&#13;
external debt. However, power sector financial capabilities should be improved, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
Annex 6.6&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
there are unsatisfactory accounting, internal audit controls, financial projections and&#13;
commercial procedures (i.e. receivables amount to about 200 days). Under the&#13;
proposed ESM project, the Bank would agree with CEL targets on managerial,&#13;
financial and commercial aspects, that would be closely monitored.&#13;
13.    Private Participation in the Power Sector. The Bank has concluded that even if&#13;
tariffs are set at economic costs, CEL will have serious difficulties in raising the&#13;
required capital to cover the ever-increasing costs of new investment programs. The&#13;
proposed ESM project would support the implementation of the recommended&#13;
regulatory framework and the creation and operation of the new planning and&#13;
regulatory institutions, which would create confidence in private investors to&#13;
participate in the ownership of the formerly private distribution companies, co-&#13;
generation and independent power production. Even though legislation has not yet&#13;
been enacted, GOES launched a program for private participation in power genera-&#13;
tion, which was supported by the Bank through the Power TAL. The first pre-&#13;
qualification of bidders to provide 80 MW under the independent power producer&#13;
(IPP) format was called in October 1993, the first power purchase agreement was&#13;
signed in July 1994 and the plant will be commissioned in 1995.&#13;
14.    Lessons Learn from the Implementation of the Power TAL Project. The&#13;
Power TAL, which was effective in December 1991, financed sectoral studies (institu-&#13;
tional-legal-regulatory reform, privatization and electricity pricing) and engineering&#13;
studies (hydroelectric pre-feasibility studies, Acajutla thermal plant extension,&#13;
assessment of the Berlin geothermal field potential, transmission system rehabilitation,&#13;
distribution system rehabilitation, CEL management and updating of the power&#13;
expansion plan). All the sectoral studies and most of the engineering studies were&#13;
completed by the end of 1993. Feasibility studies for geothermal and hydro power&#13;
projects are expected will be completed early in 1995. The progress of the project as&#13;
of February 28, 1994 is:&#13;

15.   Conclusions. The most important conclusions on the lessons learned are:&#13;
(i) the Government has shown its firm decision to reform the economy and restructure&#13;
the energy sector, in spite of politic implications. Consequently, the Government&#13;
should receive strong support -through the proposed project- to assure an adequate&#13;
implementation of sectoral reforms and to keep acceptable electricity rate levels;&#13;
(ii) because of the importance of the decided restructuring of the energy sector, and&#13;
the probable opposition from some institutions or group of persons, the Government&#13;
should appoint a high-level manager to lead the restructuring and privatization&#13;
process; (iii) the Government-assisted by the special unit created to execute the&#13;
Power TAL project (UES)- and CEL have demonstrated a good executing capacity,&#13;
therefore no major difficulties should be expected from the implementation of the&#13;
proposed project; and (iv) delays observed in the execution of most of the studies&#13;
funded by the Power TAL were caused mainly by procurement issues, aggravated by&#13;
the new procedures implemented by the Bank in bidding documentation, thus CEL's&#13;
staff competence in procurement aspects should be strengthened during the proposed&#13;
project launch seminar.&#13;

Project Implementation Plan&#13;
1.    A project implementation plan has been developed taking into consideration lessons learned&#13;
on past projects, in particular experience from the implementation of the ongoing Power TAL&#13;
project. The plan was designed in particular to: (a) have a strong sector executing agency&#13;
controlled by an inter-ministerial unit responsible for implementation of sector reforms (policy and&#13;
institutional components), and a Project Implementation Unit at CEL to be in charge of&#13;
implementation of the investment component; and (b) have a satisfactory procurement unit, using&#13;
experienced CEL staff providing assistance to both executing agencies. A full-time Project&#13;
Director would be appointed by the Government to coordinate activities and to act as the focal&#13;
point of dialogue with the Bank. This arrangement would be confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
2.    The inter-ministerial unit would be the existing CEPE (Executing Commission for the&#13;
Energy Project), which includes the Minister of Planning, the Ministry of Economy and the&#13;
President of CEL and was established by Executive Decree to implement sector reforms funded&#13;
under the Power TAL. CEPE, with the advise from the existing UES (Unit for Sector Studies)&#13;
would be the executing agency for the technical assistance supporting legal and institutional&#13;
reforms, and include: preparation of secondary legislation, restructuring of CEL, implementation&#13;
of the planning and regulatory agencies, and privatization programs. CEL's Project&#13;
Implementation Unit would be the executing agency for the investment component.&#13;
3.    The Project Director would have the responsibility to implement the project in accordance&#13;
with the agreed project implementation plan, which would be periodically reviewed and adjusted&#13;
when necessary. The chief features of the plan are:&#13;
(i)   effectiveness of the loan would be accomplished in no more than 90 days after&#13;
approval of the loan;&#13;
(ii)   TOR for technical assistance and short list of consultants would be prepared by&#13;
CEL and UES, with the assistance from the Bank if required. The studies would be comrnissioned&#13;
soon following effectiveness. Studies relating to restructuring of the power sector would be&#13;
completed by the October 1996, and the studies related to the strengthening of CEL's financial&#13;
systems would be completed in mid-1996. Finally, the engineering studies concerned with the&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion of hydro plants, and with telecommunications would be commissioned&#13;
following loan effectiveness and would be completed by the end of 1996. The study relating to the&#13;
development of future hydro resources would be commissioned in late 1995 and would be&#13;
completed by the end of 1997;&#13;
(iii) work on the rehabilitation and modernization of hydro plants would commence&#13;
in late 1995; the installation of the third unit at Cerron Grande may take three years, for&#13;

ENERGY SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Bank Supervision Plan&#13;
Bank Supervision Inputs for Project Supervision&#13;
1.    Because of the complexity of the project, which in addition to regular investment, includes&#13;
sector and institutional reform, Bank supervision will require additional resources, as indicated in&#13;
the table below. The requirements shown are in addition to the regular supervision requirements&#13;
at headquarters, to review progress, procurement actions, disbursement status, financial statements,&#13;
audit reports and related correspondence. A total of 56 sw will be required for site visits to&#13;
review policy, institutional and investment components, and establish appropriate procedures for&#13;
monitoring the Project.&#13;
Quarterly Progress Reports&#13;
2.     Semi-annual progress reports will be submitted by CEL with inputs from UES and&#13;
MIPLAN. These reports will provide an update of: (a) project implementation (physical and&#13;
financial progress), procurement activities, contract awards, disbursements and special account&#13;
balance; (b) compliance with the Performance Plan of CEL; and (c) operation of the restructured&#13;
sector (regulations, institutions and privatization programs). The reports will monitor performance&#13;
against appraisal schedules and expected goals, analyzing deviations and proposing mitigation&#13;
measures.&#13;
Project Management&#13;
3.     UES will act as a permanent group to coordinate and supervise the activities on the sector&#13;
restructuring, which is responsibility of the government. CEL will establish a Project&#13;
Implementation Unit to execute the investment component. UES will hold weekly meetings, and&#13;
in addition the Project Director will chair monthly UES-CEL review meetings to address issues in&#13;
project implementation and review each project component in detail for quarterly reporting.&#13;
Additional management-level meetings would also be convened at short notice when needed to&#13;
resolve urgent issues. The Project Director will also coordinate project activities with IDB and&#13;
other financing agencies, and act as the regular link with the Bank for project implementation&#13;
aspects.&#13;

ENERGY SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Economic Justification of the Project&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    This Annex presents the assumptions and working detail for the economic&#13;
justification of the project. This has been undertaken for, separately: (a) the&#13;
modernization and rehabilitation of the Guajoyo, 5 de Noviembre and Cerron Grande&#13;
hydroelectric stations; and (b) the expansion of Cerron Grande with the addition of a&#13;
third unit.&#13;
2.    Basis for Econoniic Costs and Monetary Benefits. All monetary costs and&#13;
benefits are expressed in 1994 prices. No corrections were made to monetary values&#13;
by shadow pricing factors because the domestic component is negligible and the&#13;
exchange rate is market valued. Costs are however based on border prices, i.e.,&#13;
exclusive of duties and taxes. Net Present Values were calculated using a 12%&#13;
discount rate.&#13;
Economic Appraisal of the Rehabilitation and Modernization of Hydroelectric Stations.&#13;
3.    The scope of this component of the project is described in para 6.6. The&#13;
main assumptions are as follows:&#13;
a. Guajoyo: the cost of the investment is US$4.28 million; incremental&#13;
operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs are estimated to be US$70,000 per&#13;
annum; the increase in utilization is expected to be 720 hours (representing an&#13;
increase in output of approximately 20%); the economic life of the renovated&#13;
assets is taken to be 20 years; station capacity is 15 MW;&#13;
b. 5 de Noviembre: the cost of the investment is US$19.12 million; this will&#13;
provide for both an increase in capacity of 9.4 MW and an increase in&#13;
utilization of 480 hours; incremental operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs&#13;
are estimated to be US$43,260 per annum; the economic life of the renovated&#13;
assets is again assumed to be 20 years;&#13;
c. Cerron Grande: the cost of the investment is US$2.62 million; incremental&#13;
operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs are estimated to be US$143,000 per&#13;
annum; the increase in utilization is expected to be 120 hours; the economic&#13;
life of the assets is again assumed to be 10 years, reflecting the shorter life of&#13;
control equipment; station capacity is 135 MW (the additional unit is not taken&#13;
into account).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4.    The above are based on engineering appraisals which have been reviewed by&#13;
the Bank and found to be satisfactory. That there will be an increment in O&amp;M costs&#13;
is to some extent debatable as rehabilitation will in general produce at least an initial&#13;
saving in O&amp;M costs. In each case, the increase in output has been valued at the&#13;
projected bulk supply tariff (approximately US$0.068/kWh). The use of this, rather&#13;
than the tariff to final consumers reduced by losses, reflects the vertically&#13;
disaggregated framework for the sector envisaged by the GOES in the Electricity&#13;
Law. A summary of the results is presented below in Table A7. 1. This shows the&#13;
EIRR and NPV for a range of scenarios reflecting assumptions regarding capital costs,&#13;
the level of O&amp;M costs, and the extent to which the predicted increase in incremental&#13;
output. The results show that the economic benefit is most sensitive to the latter and&#13;
that returns to the rehabilitation works at Cerron Grande and 5 de Noviembre are&#13;
robust.&#13;

Econmic Appraisal of the Expansion of the Cerron Grande Hydroelectic Station&#13;
6.    The scope of this component of the project is described in para 6.6. Although&#13;
this scheme was not in CEL's initial least cost expansion program for the country, a&#13;
modified plan developed by CEL shows that addition of Cerron Grande Unit 3 would&#13;
lead to an increase in total costs of only 0.4%; the higher investment costs would be&#13;
almost offset by savings in fuel costs and in a reduction in the expected volume of&#13;
unserved energy. In addition this scheme is relatively simple, as the civil works for&#13;
the project are already largely in place; this makes it a good candidate for providing&#13;
insurance against slippage in the timetable of technically more difficult projects. This&#13;
is discussed in more detail in Annex 3.5.&#13;
7.    The alternative to Cerron Grande Unit 3 would be a combustion turbine, in&#13;
terms of the need to provide capacity to serve peak demand and for reserve. The&#13;
economic appraisal of Cerron Grande 3 is therefore conducted using the costs of the&#13;
combustion turbine as the project benefits.&#13;
8.    The main assumptions are:&#13;
a. a combustion turbine of capacity of 71 MW is required to provide a similar&#13;
level of peaking and reserve capability to Cerron Grande 3, taking into&#13;
account differential forced and schedule maintenance rates (2.0% and 3.8%&#13;
respectively for Cerron Grande 3 and 15.0% and 5.5% for the combustion&#13;
turbine); the equivalent capacity is calculated using the formula used by the&#13;
Electric Power Research Institute (see EPRI "Pumped Storage Planning and&#13;
Evaluation Guide", Palo Alto, California, January 1990); the forced outage&#13;
rate for the turbine is also based upon EPRI's assumptions, and is&#13;
substantially below CEL's experience of 30%;&#13;
b. the capital cost of the combustion turbine is estimated to be US$435/kW,&#13;
including IDC; fuel consumption is assumed to be 10 kWh per gallon, with&#13;
the cost of fuel being US cents 70 per gallon (the fuel used is assumed to be&#13;
No 2 diesel oil); annual O&amp;M costs are anticipated to be US$433,100; after&#13;
25 years refurbishment of the assets would cost US$21.3 million;&#13;
c. Cerron Grande 3 is estimated to have a capital cost of US$630 per kW;&#13;
annual O&amp;M costs are estimated to be US$150,000; after 25 years&#13;
refurbishment of the assets would cost US$6 million; and&#13;
d. both options would provide on average 16.2 GWh per year; this figure is&#13;
based upon expected incremental energy from Cerron Grande 3 as calculated&#13;
by the SUPER model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 7.1&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
9.    The results of the analysis are shown in Table A7.2 below (and in more detail&#13;
in A7.6). This shows that Cerron Grande Unit 3 would have an EIRR of 19.4% and&#13;
an NPV of US$4.55 mn, taking the combustion turbine as the alternative under the&#13;
assumptions outlined above. An increase in the costs of Cerron Grande Unit 3 by&#13;
20% would give an EIRR of 10.0%. It should be noted that the construction cost&#13;
already includes a 15% allowance for physical contingencies, and that there is very&#13;
little civil works required in the expansion. A reduction in the availability of Cerron&#13;
Grande 3 (to give a combustion turbine equivalent capacity of 60 MW, implying a&#13;
decrease in availability to under 80%) would give an EIRR of 12.2%. The results in&#13;
Table A7.2 indicate the relative robustness of the project relative to the alternative,&#13;
addition of a combustion turbine.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Energy Sector Modernization Project
            will: (a) improve service reliability and increase coverage
            by rehabilitating, modernizing and expanding power
            generation, transmission, subtransmission and distribution
            systems; and (b) assist in the restructuring of the
            sector's legal and regulatory framework through the
            preparation of secondary legislation and procedures, and to
            support the Electricity and Hydrocarbons Regulatory
            Commission (EHRC) and the National Energy Council (NEC) when
            their respective laws are enacted. At the same time the
            government is introducing policies to promote
            environmentally sound investments and operating procedures
            by establishing project guidelines and quality standards and
            by strengthening management and enforcement capacities.
