ANNEX 1&#13;
Description of Activities, Expenditures and Governance for the DMF II Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all administration agreements for the&#13;
Trust Fund (collectively, the "Administration Agreements" and each an "Administration Agreement")&#13;
between the Bank and any entities that provide any funds to the Trust Fund (collectively, the&#13;
"Donors").&#13;
1.    Objectives and Governance Arrangements&#13;
The primary development objective of the Trust Fund is to help strengthen debt management capacity&#13;
and institutions in DMF 11 eligible countries, defined as all IDA-eligible countries, including those that&#13;
were IDA-eligible countries in 2008 when the DMF I (defined below) was launched even if they may&#13;
have graduated, and any additional IDA-eligible countries added over time, which at all times includes&#13;
all of the countries in the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) ("Eligible Countries").&#13;
The Trust Fund supports DMF II, whose objectives, basic principles, activities and governance&#13;
arrangements are described in the charter adopted on November 22, 2013 as such charter may be&#13;
amended from time to time in accordance with its terms (the "DMF II Charter"). The Trust Fund is&#13;
governed by the terms of this Administration Agreement and the DMF 11 Charter.&#13;
The current charter for DMF II is provided as Attachment I to this Annex 1 for informational purposes&#13;
only. Any amendments to the DMF 11 Charter, made in accordance with its terms, will become&#13;
applicable to this Administration Agreement as such amendments take effect without further need to&#13;
amend this Administration Agreement; provided that such amendments do not conflict with applicable&#13;
Bank policies and procedures and provided further that in the event of any conflict with other parts of&#13;
the Administration Agreement, the terms of this Administration Agreement shall prevail. Capitalized&#13;
terms used herein, but not otherwise defined in this Administration Agreement, shall have the&#13;
meanings ascribed to them in the DMF II Charter.&#13;
2.    Activities&#13;
The Trust Fund will finance the categories of activities set forth in Section IV.1 of the DMF II Charter,&#13;
as amended from time to time by decision' of the DMF II Steering Committee in accordance with its&#13;
terms. The specific activities will be set forth in the annual work program endorsed by the Steering&#13;
Committee.&#13;
These categories of activities are either (i) managed by the Bank ("Bank-Managed Activities") or (ii)&#13;
managed by the IMF ("IMF-Managed Activities"), as specified in the DMF II Charter. Bank-Managed&#13;
Activities are conducted under Bank responsibility, fiduciary and otherwise, in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's policies and procedures. IMF-Managed Activities are conducted under IMF responsibility,&#13;
fiduciary and otherwise, in accordance with the IMF's policies and procedures. DMF-ll activities that&#13;
are undertaken collaboratively between the Bank and the IMF are conducted, from operational, legal&#13;
and fiduciary perspectives, as a combination of separate Bank-Managed Activities and IMF-Managed&#13;
Activities. Any "joint" activities are undertaken with separate and distinct responsibility on the part of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿5&#13;
the Bank and the IMF as to their respective portions regardless of who is leading such activity. In&#13;
collaborating and coordinating with the IMF, including compiling documents for transmission to the&#13;
SC or donors, the Secretariat does not become responsible for IMF activities or obligations.&#13;
The Bank-Managed Activities may be Bank-executed and/or Recipient-executed, as specified below.&#13;
Bank-Managed activities which are Bank-executed (for which the Bank has implementation&#13;
responsibility), may include those listed in paragraphs (a) through (1) of Section 4.1.1. of the DMF II&#13;
Charter as amended from time to time by decision of the DMF II Steering Committee in accordance&#13;
with its terms.&#13;
Bank-Managed Activities which are Recipient-executed (for which one or more Recipients (as defined&#13;
in Annex 2) have implementation responsibility) may include those listed in paragraphs (a), (b), (c),&#13;
(d), (e), (f), (i), (k) and (1) of Section 4.1.1. of the DMF II Charter, as amended from time to time by&#13;
decision of the DMF II Steering Committee in accordance with its terms. During Trust Fund&#13;
implementation, the categories of activities listed in paragraphs (g) and (h) of Section 4.1.1. of the&#13;
DMF 11 Charter may also be Recipient-executed, if requested by the Steering Committee and accepted&#13;
by the Bank, subject to the Recipients' capacity to execute such activities.&#13;
IMF-Managed Activities may include those specified in the DMF II Charter, as amended from time to&#13;
time by decision of the DMF 11 Steering Committee in accordance with its terms.&#13;
3.    Eligible Expenditures&#13;
3.1   For Bank-Managed Activities which are Bank-executed, the Trust Fund funds may be used to&#13;
finance: (a) associated overheads; (b) consultant fees individuals and firms; (c) contractual services;&#13;
(d) equipment and office premises lease cost; (e) extended term consultants with no indirects; (f)&#13;
extended term consultants; (g) media, workshop, conference and meeting; (h) staff costs with indirect&#13;
costs; (i) staff costs with no indirect costs; (j) temporary support staff costs; (k) temporary staff costs&#13;
with no indirects; and (1) travel expenses.&#13;
3.2   For Bank-Managed Activities which are Recipient-executed, the Trust Fund funds may be used&#13;
to finance: (a) consulting services; (b) operating costs; and (c) training.&#13;
3.3   For IMF-Managed Activities, categories of expenditures applicable to the Trust Fund funds&#13;
transferred to the IMF shall follow IMF's applicable policies and procedures. Following disbursement&#13;
by the Bank of funds from the Trust Fund to the IMF, the Bank shall have no further responsibility for&#13;
the IMF's use of the funds and activities carried out therewith.&#13;
4.    Taxes&#13;
4.1   The foregoing activities and categories of expenditures may include the financing of taxes in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿6&#13;
5.    Program Criteria&#13;

I.    Introduction&#13;
1.1   The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("IBRD") and the International&#13;
Development Association ("IDA") (collectively, the "Bank"), the International Monetary Fund&#13;
("IMF") and certain donors to one or more trust funds for the Debt Management Facility ("DMF")&#13;
have adopted the present charter (the "Charter").&#13;
1.2   The DMF provides capacity building to support growth and poverty reduction in eligible&#13;
developing countries by strengthening their capacity to manage debt effectively. The first phase of the&#13;
DMF (the "DMF I") was launched in November 2008 with a multi-donor trust fund administered by&#13;
the Bank (the "DMF I Trust Fund") to address the need to strengthen public debt management in low&#13;
income countries ("LICs").' The second phase of the DMF (the "DMF II") is supported by one or&#13;
more new trust funds administered by the Bank (the "DMF II Trust Fund") and builds on the strong&#13;
partnership that has existed between the Bank and the IMF on the delivery of capacity building&#13;
(technical assistance ("TA") and training) on debt management and debt sustainability initiatives aimed&#13;
at debt relief (HIPC, MDRI) and debt management issues (particularly, the application of the medium&#13;
term debt management strategy framework (the "MTDS"2). The DMF II aims to foster closer&#13;
collaboration between the Bank and the IMF, both to leverage institutional expertise, and as the&#13;
designated implementing agencies that provide TA and training for DMF 11 activities. This&#13;
arrangement also seeks to promote collaboration among a wide range of institutions, including the&#13;
DMF II implementing partners ("IPs"), other bilateral agencies and multilateral development banks.&#13;
1.3.  This Charter sets out the governance arrangements of the DMF 11 that encapsulate this&#13;
collaborative arrangement, as endorsed by the donors to the DMF I Trust Fund who had expressed their&#13;
intention to participate in the DMF II by November 22, 2013.&#13;
II.   Basic Principles&#13;
2.1   The DMF 11 is conceived as a capacity building facility to help strengthen debt management&#13;
capacity in Eligible Countries (as defined below). It recognizes that debt management does not take&#13;
place in isolation. To be effective, the activities of the DMF II work program must be linked to, and&#13;
influenced by, the broader financial and economic circumstances that impact a country's debt portfolio.&#13;
2.2   "Eligible Countries" are all IDA-eligible countries, including those that were IDA-eligible&#13;
countries in 2008 when the DMF I was launched even if they may have graduated and any additional&#13;
IDA-eligible countries added over time, which at all times includes all of the countries in the IMF's&#13;
Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).    Any requests for coordinated activities from&#13;
government authorities in Eligible Countries will be centralized by and through the Secretariat,&#13;
including for record-keeping purposes.&#13;
I The DMF I successfully completed four years of activity since it became operational in May 2009. The DMF I Trust&#13;
Fund is scheduled to close on June 30, 2014.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿10&#13;
2.3    DMF-II activities are either (i) activities managed by the Bank ("Bank-Managed Activities") or&#13;
(ii) activities managed by the IMF ("IMF-Managed Activities").   Bank-Managed Activities are&#13;
conducted under Bank responsibility, fiduciary and otherwise, in accordance with the Bank's policies&#13;
and procedures. IMF-Managed Activities are conducted under IMF responsibility, fiduciary and&#13;
otherwise, in accordance with the IMF's policies and procedures.   DMF-II activities that are&#13;
undertaken collaboratively between the Bank and the IMF are conducted, from operational, legal and&#13;
fiduciary perspectives, as a combination of separate Bank-Managed Activities and IMF-Managed&#13;
Activities. Any "joint" activities are undertaken with separate and distinct responsibility on the part of&#13;
the Bank and the IMF as to their respective portions regardless of who is leading such activity. In&#13;
collaborating and coordinating with the IMF, including compiling documents for transmission to the&#13;
SC or donors, the Secretariat does not become responsible for IMF activities or obligations.&#13;
2.4    For DMF II, the Bank collaborates through the Economic Policy, Debt and Trade Department&#13;
(PRMET), and, regarding administrative and procedural issues, the IMF collaborates through the&#13;
Institute for Capacity Development (ICD).3 4 The ICD serves as the IMF's focal point of contact for&#13;
communicating and coordinating with the Bank, particularly the Secretariat. The Bank and the IMF&#13;
normally meet quarterly to assess the progress made, discuss outstanding issues and analyze country-&#13;
program specifics.&#13;
2.5    With respect to every contribution provided by donors to the DMF 1I Trust Fund, the Trustee&#13;
transfers 37% of the amount (net of the Bank's cost recovery fee5) to the IMF for implementation of&#13;
IMF-Managed Activities under the terms of a transfer agreement entered into between the Bank and&#13;
the IMF, provided that this percentage may be adjusted from time to time as agreed between the Bank&#13;
and the IMF. The Global Partnerships Division of ICD will manage the IMF portion of DMF II funds&#13;
that are transferred-out from the contributions received by the Bank.&#13;
2.6    The guiding principles ("Guiding Principles") for the activities and operational modalities of&#13;
the DMF 11 are as follows:&#13;
* The DMF II adopts a programmatic approach for strengthening debt management capacity in&#13;
Eligible Countries. This recognizes that capacity development is a longer term endeavor that&#13;
requires a sustained engagement over time.&#13;
Internal department designations may change over time, as notified by the Bank or the IMF, as the case may be, to the&#13;
members of the Steering Committee.&#13;
4&#13;
The ICD serves as the IMF's focal point of contact for communicating and coordinating with the Bank, particularly the&#13;
Secretariat. This point of contact is for all of the IMF's DMF II activities and represents all relevant IMF departments,&#13;
including the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM), Statistics (STA) and&#13;
the Strategy, Policy and Review Department (SPR). It is understood that these IMF departments may also communicate&#13;
directly with the Bank on the implementation of projects and other related issues.&#13;
The Bank's cost recovery fee is reflected in the Administration Agreement signed between the Bank and each donor.&#13;
These Administration Agreements are made publicly available once they are counter-signed by the respective donor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿11&#13;
*  The entire work program is demand-driven, i.e., Eligible Countries drive the application of&#13;
Debt Management Performance Assessments ("DeMPAs"), the design of debt management&#13;
reform programs, assistance to develop domestic debt markets, issuance in international capital&#13;
markets, establishing a risk management framework, undertaking debt sustainability analyses&#13;
("DSAs"), and applying the MTDS toolkit.&#13;
*  There is no established sequence for the activities, although it normally makes sense to begin&#13;
with a diagnostic followed by a more targeted intervention. These core activities are&#13;
supplemented by training activities, including on DSAs, and peer learning initiatives.&#13;
*  To avoid conflicts of interest in procurement, any involvement by an entity in a debt&#13;
management reform plan (as further described under "Activities" below) precludes involvement&#13;
by that entity in Bank-financed operations to implement such reform plan; provided that within&#13;
the Bank, this is understood to mean that individual staff working on a reform plan may not be&#13;
the same as staff working on implementation of such reform plan.&#13;
*  Any "downstream" activity resulting from DMF 11 activities, specifically implementation of&#13;
reform plans, will not be financed under the DMF 11.6&#13;
* Donor funding to the DMF 11 is used in part to fund grant agreements to IPs through allocations&#13;
to the Bank for Bank-Managed Activities.&#13;
*  The DMF 11 coordination activities are expected to catalyze IP services for building debt&#13;
management capacity and promote the transfer of responsibility to IPs, while ensuring that&#13;
quality is not compromised.&#13;
*  Improved coordination is sought among institutions that provide debt management TA and&#13;
training, share and disseminate sound practice in public debt management, and promote&#13;
international dialogue on debt management issues, including the Bank, the IMF and the IPs, in&#13;
order to benefit Eligible Countries.&#13;
III.  Governance Structure&#13;
111.1. Steering Committee (SC)&#13;
3.1.1 The DMF II has a Steering Committee (SC). The SC comprises one representative of each of&#13;
the donors to the DMF II Trust Fund that meets the funding eligibility requirements and one&#13;
representative from each of the Bank and the IMF. Under the eligibility requirements for the DMF 11,&#13;
donors are required to make a minimum commitment to contribute to the DMF 11 Trust Fund of USD&#13;
1.0 million over a two-year period to have a representative at the SC.7&#13;
3.1.2 The SC is co-chaired by the Bank and the IMF, also acting in decision making capacities.&#13;
Relevant staff from the Bank and the IMF may be invited by the co-chairs, each respectively as to its&#13;
institution, to attend SC meetings as observers. The regular SC meetings take place on an annual basis&#13;
6,"Downstream" activities are not envisaged for implementation under DMF II and may, for example, be included in&#13;
implementation of reform actions outlined in the "debt management reform/capacity building plan" mission report&#13;
Under the eligibility requirements for the DMF II Trust Fund, any donor must make a minimum contribution commitment&#13;
of USD 1.0 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿12&#13;
in connection with the Annual Stakeholders Forum of the DMF II. 8 The SC may also hold ad-hoc&#13;
meetings on the request of a representative. The organization of SC meetings is facilitated by the&#13;
Secretariat, in consultation with the IMF.&#13;
3.1.3 Decisions by the SC are made by consensus. For the purpose of this Charter, consensus is a&#13;
procedure for adopting a decision in a meeting when no participant blocks a proposed decision. It need&#13;
not reflect unanimity. A dissenting decision maker that does not wish to block a decision may state an&#13;
objection to be recorded in the meeting minutes. The Chair articulates the consensus view.&#13;
3.1.4 Decisions by the SC may also be made on an electronic no-objection basis. In such cases, the&#13;
Secretariat circulates to all representatives designated to the SC the proposed decision and specifies the&#13;
period during which any representative may object. An objection by any representative to a proposed&#13;
decision precludes a decision. If no objection is received prior to expiration of the specified review&#13;
period, the decision is recorded and notified to the representatives by the Secretariat.&#13;
3.1.5  The SC is responsible for the following:&#13;
*  Providing overall strategic guidance for implementation of the DMF II.&#13;
*  Reviewing the DMF 11 annual report.&#13;
*  Endorsing the annual DMF 11 work program and financial plan.&#13;
*  Reviewing adherence to the Guiding Principles and monitoring implementation of the endorsed&#13;
annual work program.&#13;
*  Reviewing M&amp;E reports on the Bank's and IMF's respective log frames&#13;
111.2. Secretariat&#13;
3.2.1 The DMF Secretariat is located in the Bank's headquarters in Washington, DC and operates&#13;
under the Bank's policies and procedures. The Secretariat is comprised of professional and&#13;
administrative staff employed by the Bank and headed by a Program Manager. The Bank is responsible&#13;
for the administrative and managerial oversight of all Secretariat staff (including consultants and any&#13;
secondees).&#13;
3.2.2  The Secretariat responsibilities include:&#13;
* Managing DMF II's day-to-day operations with respect to the Bank's DMF II activities.&#13;
* Providing administrative support to the SC, including coordinating meetings, handling no&#13;
objection processes, and maintaining records of SC business, such as meeting minutes,&#13;
decisions and Charter amendments.&#13;
* Submitting the annual DMF 11 work program and financial plan to the SC for endorsement.&#13;
* Submitting the DMF 11 annual report to the SC for review.&#13;
*  Submitting M&amp;E reports on the Bank's and IMF's respective log frames to the SC for review.&#13;
The Annual Stakeholders Forum is an annual stakeholders' event that provides a forum to discuss policy-relevant issues&#13;
on debt management and, current challenges faced by developing countries with respect to debt management and to foster&#13;
knowledge exchange among participants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿13&#13;
* Coordinating with donors, the IMF, and the IPs.&#13;
* Organizing and coordinating meetings and workshops for participation of donors and&#13;
stakeholders from time to time, to discuss broad issues, development agenda and strategies&#13;
related to debt management and debt market development in Eligible Countries.&#13;
* Identifying opportunities for DMF 11 assistance by working with key stakeholders.&#13;
* Leading the organization of the Annual Stakeholders Forum.&#13;

IV.   Work Program&#13;
IV.1. Activities&#13;
4.1.1 The categories of activities carried out under the DMF II, with specific activities constituting&#13;
the annual work program endorsed by the SC, are as follows:&#13;
a) Application of the Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) tool. This&#13;
provides benchmark country debt management performance using the Bank's DeMPA tool.&#13;
b) Design of Debt Management Reform Plans. This provides detailed and sequenced&#13;
country-owned capacity building project plans that aim to alleviate the weaknesses identified&#13;
and analyzed by the DeMPA or through other assessments. These plans detail expected&#13;
outputs and outcomes, actions, sequencing and milestones and provide an estimate of budget&#13;
and resources required to implement the respective plans.&#13;
c) Assistance in Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) development. This&#13;
provides TA on the joint Bank-IMF MTDS framework for formulating and implementing a&#13;
debt management strategy for the medium term.&#13;
d) Strengthening capacity in the application of the Joint Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability&#13;
Framework (DSF). This provides regional training and knowledge activities related to the&#13;
DSF in Eligible Countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿14&#13;
e) Domestic Debt Market Development. This builds on the "Local Currency Bond Market-A&#13;
Diagnostic Framework"9 to identify strengths and weaknesses of debt markets and to guide&#13;
the reform plan process taken at the government's request to design debt market reforms.&#13;
f) Subnational Debt Management. This applies the subnational DeMPA tool to provide&#13;
training on the subnational DSAs and TA on subnational debt management.&#13;
g) Risk Management. This aims at building capacity to better address macro-financial risks&#13;
involved in managing public debt portfolios and establishing a well-defined framework to&#13;
manage and mitigate those risks.&#13;
h) International Capital Markets Access. This assists Eligible Countries to fully assess the&#13;
likely impact of issuance in the international capital markets on the debt portfolio and&#13;
understand the relative costs and risks and provides advice to country authorities on the&#13;
operational systems that need to be put in place to transact effectively and manage risks&#13;
through the life of the transaction.&#13;
i) The Debt Managers' Network program (DMN). This is a community of government debt&#13;
management practitioners' aimed at sharing experience, exchanging information and helping&#13;
to foster peer learning through virtual meetings and is supported through a designated web&#13;
page that offers an online platform for information sharing and discussions.&#13;
j) Supporting knowledge activities such as the Debt Managers Practitioners' Program&#13;
(DMPP). This enables government officials from debt management offices in Eligible&#13;
Countries to be seconded to the Bank for three-month assignments and participate directly&#13;
in the DMF 11 work program.&#13;
k) Knowledge Products. This includes, for example, cover guidance notes on accessing&#13;
international capital markets and use of derivatives.&#13;
1) Organization of regional training events; the Annual Stakeholders' Forum, the DMF II&#13;
website, and the quarterly DMF II Newsletter; the mid-term review, and related&#13;
program management and administration.&#13;
4.1.2  With respect to the above activities: (1) (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (k) are carried out either&#13;
jointly or separately by either the Bank or the IMF; (2) (a), (i), (j) and (1) are carried out by the Bank;&#13;
and (3) (h) is carried out by the IMF but could in the future also be provided by the Bank.&#13;
IV.2. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E)&#13;
4.2.1 The Bank prepares a log-frame for M&amp;E of Bank-Managed Activities and the IMF prepares a&#13;
log frame for M&amp;E of IMF-Managed Activities. Each of the Bank and the IMF monitor their&#13;
9&#13;
Developed jointly by EBRD, IMF, OECD, and World Bank (2013). See also World Bank "Government Securities Market&#13;

DMF II Trust Fund under administration agreements/arrangements entered into by the Bank and each&#13;
of the donors. The Bank enters into a transfer agreement with the IMF to set forth the terms and&#13;
conditions of any funds transferred to the IMF from the DMF II Trust Fund. Following the transfer of&#13;
such funds by the Bank to the IMF, the IMF is responsible for the use of such funds, and the Bank has&#13;

VI.   Implementation Coordination Group (ICG)&#13;
6.1   The ICG meets at least twice a year, in person or virtually. One of the ICG meetings takes place&#13;
in connection with the DMF 11 Annual Stakeholders Forum or the Bank-IMF's Annual Meetings.&#13;
6.2   Each IP has one member representative on the ICG. The IPs at the start of the DMF 11 could be&#13;
drawn from the existing IPs of the DMF I, provided that they demonstrated appropriate capacity in&#13;
implementing DMF I activities. . The DMF II offers an open platform for IPs, with potential for the&#13;
Bank to select additional IPs in the future. The Secretariat participates as an observer in the ICG&#13;
meetings, along with the IMF.&#13;
6.3   The ICG has responsibility for coordinating implementation of DMF 11 activities among the&#13;
IPs, including:&#13;
*  Receiving information from the Secretariat on all DMF II Bank-Managed Activities and IMF-&#13;
Managed Activities.&#13;
*  Discussing and coordinating Bank-Managed Activities involving IP participation.&#13;
*  Providing inputs to the DMF 11 Secretariat regarding demand for DMF II activities in Eligible&#13;
Countries.&#13;

*  Sharing information with the Secretariat on regular basis (six-month) regarding "downstream"&#13;
implementing activities arising from DMF II activities.&#13;
*  Information sharing regarding efforts taken in Eligible Countries that have not adopted the&#13;
DMF II's programmatic interventions.&#13;
*  Highlighting specific issues that may impact DMF II activities.&#13;
6.4   The ICG is chaired by an elected member from the IPs, elected for a 2-year period. The&#13;
administrative support for the ICG will be provided by the Chair's organization. Any decisions by the&#13;
ICG are made on the basis of consensus. The decisions by the ICG are submitted in writing to the SC&#13;
and presented at SC meetings by the chair of the ICG.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿16&#13;
VII. Panel of Experts (PoE)&#13;
7.1   The PoE supports the SC in ensuring the quality and relevance of DMF II activities.&#13;
7.2   The PoE meets at least twice a year, in person or virtually. One of the PoE meetings takes place&#13;
in connection with the DMF II Annual Stakeholders Forum or the Bank-IMF's Annual Meetings.&#13;
7.3   The PoE comprises experts selected on the basis of their expertise in government debt&#13;
management. The Bank and the IMF jointly decide the selection criteria and the individuals selected.&#13;
The DMF II offers an open platform for experts, with potential for the Bank and the IMF to select&#13;
additional experts in the future.&#13;
7.4   The PoE has responsibility for:&#13;
*  Reviewing and commenting on the draft annual DMF 11 work programs prepared by the&#13;
Secretariat for the SC.&#13;
* Advising the Secretariat and the SC on any additional areas of debt management that could be&#13;
supported through the DMF II.&#13;
* At the request of the SC, providing advice on specific, technical issues.&#13;
*  Reviewing and commenting on specific reports prepared in connection with DMF 11 activities.&#13;
*  Provide any other recommendations that ensure quality and relevance of DMF 11 activities.&#13;
7.5   The PoE meetings are organized and moderated by the Secretariat, and any decisions by the&#13;
PoE are made on the basis of consensus. The Bank and the IMF participate as observers in the PoE&#13;
meetings. The PoE's decisions and recommendations are submitted in writing to the SC and presented&#13;
at SC meetings by a representative chosen on a consensus basis by the PoE.&#13;
7.6   To avoid conflicts of interest, PoE members must abstain from (a) reviewing any materials in&#13;
connection with a DMF 11 activity that includes their involvement; and (b) evaluating any DMF II&#13;
activity that includes their involvement.&#13;
VIII. Amendments&#13;
6.1   Amendments to this Charter can be proposed by any member of the SC through the Secretariat&#13;
or by the Secretariat at any time. Any amendments to the Charter require approval of the SC to&#13;
become effective in accordance with the decision making procedures set forth in this Charter.&#13;
IX.   Review&#13;
Following three years of implementation, a mid-term review will be conducted with external&#13;
participation, as coordinated by the Secretariat. Based on the findings, a specific strategy for the future&#13;
of the DMF will be agreed by the SC to coincide with closure of the DMF II Trust Fund.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between&#13;
the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or&#13;
trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement&#13;
shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of&#13;
Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its&#13;
framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use&#13;
of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the&#13;
relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United&#13;
Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank&#13;
under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an&#13;
individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be&#13;
kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee,&#13;
has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3   Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency&#13;
other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying&#13;
Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange&#13;
rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to&#13;
complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear&#13;
any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿18&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of&#13;
the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of&#13;
trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the&#13;
Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.    Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1   The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an&#13;
amount equal to one point six percent ( 1.6 %) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management&#13;
and Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as&#13;
an administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the Administration Agreements in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on&#13;
an actual basis up to a maximum of two point fifteen percent (2.15%) of the total Contributions under&#13;
all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3   Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund&#13;
Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first&#13;
Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the&#13;
Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section,&#13;
which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and&#13;
which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments&#13;
to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration&#13;
Agreements.&#13;

together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne&#13;
by the Bank.&#13;
4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an&#13;
external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall&#13;

with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;

the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs&#13;
incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation&#13;

Agreement; unless otherwise agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
7.    Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
