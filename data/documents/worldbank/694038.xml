Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower                           Republic of Yemen&#13;
Implementing Agency                The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources&#13;
Beneficiaries                      Poor rural families and communities in four southern&#13;
govemorates&#13;
Credit Amount                   :  SDR 17.7 million (US$24.7 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms                              Standard IDA terms with 40-year maturity, including&#13;
10 years of grace period&#13;
Commitment Fee                  :  Standard&#13;
Project Objectives                 Within the overall CAS objective of social protection,&#13;
the specific development objectives of the project are:&#13;
(i) to raise the incomes of very poor rural individuals&#13;
and their families (50-60,000 people) in the southern&#13;
govemorates of Yemen sustainably above the poverty&#13;
level; (ii) to promote overall economic and social&#13;
development in the approximately 40 extended rural&#13;
communities (up to about 150,000 people in total,&#13;
including those already benefiting under (i)) in which&#13;
the target population reside and in which there is a&#13;
very high concentration of poor people; and (iii) to&#13;
test innovations regarding the involvement of&#13;
beneficiaries in planning and implementation and&#13;
regarding a business approach to project management.&#13;
Project Description             :  Project components are: (i) land allocation and&#13;
development or rehabilitation on about 3,900 ha;&#13;
(ii) off-farm   income   development   activities;&#13;
(iii) economic and social development activities in&#13;
approximately   40    extended    communities;&#13;
(iv) preparation of future projects in the sector; and&#13;
(v) operation of a project management unit.&#13;
Environment                     :  The Project has been classified as a Category B for the&#13;
purpose of O.D. 4.01. The principal environment risks&#13;
are: groundwater overdraft or contamination, which&#13;
would be avoided by monitoring, management and high&#13;
technical specifications; and soil salination and wind&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
erosion, which would be mitigated through irrigation&#13;
management, leaching and wind-breaks.&#13;
Povertv                        :  The project is classified under the Program of Targeted&#13;
Interventions. It is aimed at the alleviation of the&#13;
poverty of poor people and communities in poor areas&#13;
of the rural south, particularly those adversely affected&#13;
by recent changes in land tenure and by the economic&#13;
transition consequent to unification.&#13;
Benefits                          The project would supplement the means of economic&#13;
livelihood for about 50-60,000 people, together with&#13;
improvements in welfare arising from community&#13;
development activities for a total of up to 150,000.&#13;
The farm units of 2 ha would generate incomes of&#13;
between $2,600 and $4,000 per farm family, varying&#13;
according to the crop mix. For the fisheries&#13;
component, annual fish catch per boat is expected to&#13;
be 28 tons, generating incomes in excess of $3,000 a&#13;
year for 280 poor families. Other revenue-earning&#13;
enterprise activities (training, credit, etc.) are expected&#13;
to provide greater surety of income and new-found&#13;
employment or business for up to 6,850 trainees, each&#13;
of whom is expected to attain annual earnings of&#13;
between $500 and $1,000 a year subsequent to&#13;
training.   Improvements  in  women's  animal&#13;
husbandry are expected to generate annual income of&#13;
about $185,000 throughout the project area,&#13;
supplementing the incomes of many women.&#13;
Risks                          :  Principal risks are: (a) the macroeconomic risk that&#13;
Government's stabilization and adjustment program&#13;
and decentralized poverty alleviation policy may falter&#13;
- this risk is minimized by the current strong&#13;
performance backed up by dialogue and adjustment&#13;
lending, and by the careful monitoring that will be&#13;
continuous throughout the project period; (b) the risk&#13;
that the project may not be well managed, or that it&#13;
may prove over-complex - this would be avoided by&#13;
the setting up of an autonomous project management&#13;
unit run on business lines and by the continuous&#13;
involvement of the community in planning and&#13;
execution; (c) the risk that water resources might be&#13;
insufficient - this risk has been reduced by careful&#13;
studies during preparation, by fitting the proposed&#13;
water development within an overall water resources&#13;
management framework, and by the provision for&#13;
monitoring during the project; (d) the risk that some&#13;
unanticipated claim could conceivably arise to lands&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
assigned for development under the project - this risk&#13;
has been substantially eliminated by the extensive&#13;
process of screening undertaken during project&#13;
preparation and appraisal, including the issue of a&#13;
Council   of   Minister's    Decree    establishing&#13;
Government title, an exhaustive title search, and&#13;
consultation with the local community; and (e) the&#13;
risk to farm productivity from farmner risk aversion, or&#13;
from the possible lack of credit for inputs or of&#13;
adequate profitable market outlets - this risk has been&#13;
reduced by the investment under the project in high&#13;
grade contract extension services that would help&#13;
farmers to prepare professional business plans.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
SOUTHERN GOVERNORATES RURAL&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Socio-Economic and Sectoral Background&#13;
1.1    The Government of Yemen has requested IDA assistance in financing the Southern Governorates&#13;
Rural Development Project. The project is designed to relieve rural poverty in the arid southern governorates&#13;
of the country. This introduction describes the challenge for the proposed project - how to raise incomes&#13;
sustainably in poor rural regions of Yemen in a context of general economic crisis, a marked deterioration in&#13;
public services and limited natural and human resource potential.&#13;
1.2.   Yemen Unification and Transition. The Republic of Yemen was created in May 1990 by agreement&#13;
between the governments of the former Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and People's Democratic Republic of&#13;
Yemen (PDRY). The political complexity of re-unifying the country after two decades of separation was&#13;
compounded by the needs of economic transition from the socialist economy of the south to a market based&#13;
economy.&#13;
1.3    The Economic Situation. While starting to re-link after unification, the country's two economies were&#13;
jolted again by the economic impacts of the Gulf War (1991). This triggered a massive return of migrant&#13;
Yemeni workers and a sudden decrease in financial inflows from remittances. Compounding these impacts, the&#13;
internal economic reforms started in the southern governorates with an ill-designed process of land de-&#13;
nationalization. This abruptly dispossessed a large number of cultivators of their income generating assets and&#13;
disrupted agricultural production over a wide area. As a result of these developments, the country has continued&#13;
to confront throughout the '90s major economic problems: the unemployment rate is currently over 20 percent;&#13;
real per capita income has halved, from about US$513 in 1990 to about US$216 in 1995; inflation rates reached&#13;
72 percent in 1994 (abating to single figures by mid-1997); and the currency devalued from an official rate of&#13;
YR12/US$1 in 1991 to about YR125/US$1 free market rate in mid-1997.&#13;
1.4    The Civil War. Unsolved political tensions from the unification process and growing social and&#13;
economic pressures reached crisis point in 1994, exploding in a civil war. Although the war was of short&#13;
duration, the cost, and the consequent disruptions, further aggravated the problems of the economy and&#13;
deepened poverty levels, particularly among the population of the southern governorates, making assistance&#13;
for reform and post-war reconstruction an even stronger imperative.&#13;
1.5    The Crisis in Government Services.! In this difficult economic climate, government services have&#13;
vastly weakened and in places collapsed. Fiscal constraints have reduced operating budgets to low levels, and&#13;
inflation reduced the real value of public sector pay in 1996 to 15 percent of its level in 1990. As a result, an&#13;
increasingly overstaffed and unmotivated civil service has little or no resources to actually do its job. The&#13;
delivery of many basic public services has dwindled to low levels.&#13;
1.6    Human Impact. The population is perceptibly suffering from the worsened economic situation and&#13;
impoverishment. In addition, there is a high population growth rate (estimated at 3.7 percent per annum),&#13;
with 52 percent of the population under 15 years of age and labor force growth of 4.5 percent per annum.&#13;
' See Public Expenditure Review, December 1996&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                       Southern Governorates Rural Development Project&#13;
With declining quality and coverage of education and health services, the resulting low educational standards&#13;
and very high rates of illiteracy (62 percent) give the population little advantage in the global economy.&#13;
1.7    Resource Advantages and Constraints.  Despite these very serious limitations, the country has&#13;
development potential in certain sectors, including limited oil resources and significant gas reserves. The&#13;
agriculture and rural sector has shown resilience over the last two decades, absorbing a huge increase in the rural&#13;
population into an increasingly market - oriented agriculture. Now, however, there is acute pressure on the&#13;
limited water resource and there has been little recent technological innovation that could improve productivity&#13;
and incomes.&#13;
1.8    Development Strategy. To achieve sustainable growth and to alleviate poverty, government has&#13;
adopted a new development strategy based on a reduced role for the public sector, the development of the&#13;
private sector, and direct interventions to reduce poverty. Thus, government's program currently focuses on:&#13;
(i) stabilization to restore macroeconomic balance and reduce inflation; (ii) structural reform and adjustment&#13;
to stimulate economic growth; and (iii) poverty alleviation and social protection measures. The structural&#13;
reforms are being supported by the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC, Credit No. 2840-YEM) approved in&#13;
April 1996. Poverty alleviation is to be achieved through different initiatives, including a rapid income&#13;
transfer through the Public Works Project (Credit No. 2878-YE), by the Social Fund Project (Credit No. 2953-&#13;
YE), and by the proposed project.&#13;
Agriculture and Rural Development&#13;
1.9    Yemen's agricultural sector provides about 18 percent of gross domestic product, gives employment&#13;
to about 70 percent of the economically active population, and provides about one third of the nation's staple&#13;
food supply. The principal crops are: cereals, especially sorghum and millet; legumes, notably lentils and&#13;
chickpeas; a wide variety of vegetables and fruits; and cotton and coffee. In recent years, the main areas of&#13;
growth have been qat (a plant with a mild drug content chewed locally), grapes, potatoes and onions, all of&#13;
which are very profitable for farmers. Extensive - albeit poor - pasture and widespread fodder production&#13;
support a large livestock herd, predominantly sheep and goats.&#13;
1.10   Over the last twenty years, Yemen had developed a range of services to the rural sector. However, as&#13;
a result of the crisis in Government services (para. 1.5), overstaffing and underfunding are pervasive, and the&#13;
level of basic service delivery has dropped considerably.&#13;
B. The Poverty Challenge&#13;
Background&#13;
1.11   Yemen's population growth rate of 3.7 percent per annum is one of the highest in the world. Among&#13;
countries in the Middle East and North Africa, Yemen has the lowest life expectancy (51 years), the lowest&#13;
adult literacy rate (38 percent), the highest fertility rate (7.5), and the highest infant mortality rate (11.7&#13;
percent of live births). Poverty is a major problem - in 1995, 19 percent of the population was poor (3.0&#13;
million people). Poverty is predominantly a rural phenomenon - 81 percent of the poor are living in rural&#13;
areas, where they make up 15 percent of the rural population.&#13;
1.12   The recently initiated stabilization and structural adjustment program can begin to lay the economic&#13;
foundation for a revival of economic growth and thereby the reduction of poverty. The first step in a poverty&#13;
eradication program is to redirect expenditures away from the wasteful universal subsidy program which cost&#13;
an estimated 16 percent of GDP in 1994. The second step is to take direct action to transfer resources to the&#13;
poor. The recent Poverty Assessment' thus recommends an approach that targets the poor directly, with&#13;

Southern Governorates Rural Development Project                                            3&#13;
particular emphasis on the non-governmental sector and local community groups. IDA is to support a&#13;
nationwide program on these lines through the Social Fund Project (Credit No. 2953-YE). At the same time,&#13;
the Assessment recommends special attention to the rural sector where the core of the problem lies.&#13;
1.13   The proposed project is set in the context of this special emphasis on action in the rural sector through&#13;
a community approach and through investment in sustainable increases in incomes. The objectives of the&#13;
proposed project are further defined by the dispossession of tenant farmers throughout the southern&#13;
govemorates that took place after unification. This process is explained in the next section.&#13;
Land Tenure and Rural Poverty&#13;
1.14 The general process of impoverishment in rural areas has been worsened in the southern governorates&#13;
by recent changes in land tenure. In 1970, the government of the former People's Democratic Republic of&#13;
Yemen (PDRY) passed a law that nationalized much privately owned land and assigned the land on a tenancy&#13;
basis to small farmers associated in cooperatives. After unification in 1990, the new government decided to&#13;
reverse the previous land nationalization policy and to encourage a return to private land ownership and&#13;
individual systems of production. The government passed a decree (Decree 65) that returned expropriated&#13;
land to former owners. As a result, up to 23,000 small tenant farmers in the southern governorates of&#13;
Hadramawt, Shabwa, Abyan and Lahej (see map) became liable to dispossession, and over the last five years&#13;
the great majority of them have surrendered the lands they were farming to the returning former owners.&#13;
1.15   The dispossessed tenants have been deprived of their farming income which was their principal - or in&#13;
most cases, sole - source of livelihood The process of dispossession thus aggravated the problem of rural&#13;
poverty in the area. According to the Participatory Needs Assessment conducted by IDA in 1994 as part of&#13;
project identification, income losses for the dispossessed averaged 41 percent. Most dispossessed tenants are&#13;
living below the poverty iine, and the majority of them (86 percent) are living in absolute poverty.&#13;
1.16 In 1994, Government requested help from IDA to finance a rural development project in the southern&#13;
governorates based on land development and community participation, aimed at raising incomes of very poor&#13;
people with particular focus on the dispossessed tenants, and ensuring environmentally sustainable economic&#13;
and social development in poor rural communities.&#13;
C. The Country Assistance Strategy and Lessons from IDA Lending Experience&#13;
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2&#13;
1.17   The CAS provides the underlying rationale for the decision of IDA to agree to Government's request&#13;
to consider financing the proposed project. The CAS has three main objectives:&#13;
(a)    Stabilization, Structural Reforms and Social Protection: the principal thrusts are to&#13;
support the stabilization and structural adjustment program by policy dialogue and adjustment&#13;
lending, and to attack poverty in a practical way through targeted interventions and support to&#13;
economic growth. The proposed project is designed to provide support to the poorest&#13;
segment of the community in a well-defined geographical area where targeting is possible&#13;
and where there are good prospects for a sustainable solution to poverty through economic&#13;
development. It is thus a prime means of implementing this CAS objective (see CASpara 46);&#13;
(b)    Portfolio Implementation and Sustainability of Investments: poor implementation&#13;
performance and a mixed record on sustainability of investments underlie this important&#13;
2Report 15286-YEM, January 19, 1996&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                      Southern Governorates Rural Development Project&#13;
objective. The principal tools proposed are selectivity of new investments (confined to&#13;
situations where there are good prospects of efficient implementation) and an emphasis on&#13;
cost-effective and innovative approaches to project management   The project would&#13;
contribute to the CAS objective of improving implementation and sustainability by&#13;
incorporating a change in project management approach, with an autonomous executing&#13;
agency, and by integrating beneficiary and community involvement, and self-management and&#13;
self-financing as the main foundations of sustainability (see CASpara 47fl); and&#13;
(c)    Sustainable Natural and Human Resource Development: human pressure on natural&#13;
resources is growing and the IDA program has to take up the challenge of helping sustain&#13;
incomes for a growing rural population whilst reducing the rate of mining of water and land&#13;
resources. This is being addressed at the policy and at the program level, notably through&#13;
work on the water strategy3 and the assistance program that flows from it The proposed&#13;
project is founded on detailed work on the nature and extent of the natural resource base&#13;
carried out by international consultants over the last ten years and thoroughly checked at&#13;
appraisal. Sustainable management of water, soil and the overall environment are built into&#13;
the proposed project, together with support to water resource monitoring systems (see CAS&#13;
para 51).&#13;
1.18   Because of the way in which the proposed project can contribute to the achievement of IDA program&#13;
objectives, particularly on a population segment most deprived by reform and economic transition, it was&#13;
incorporated in the CAS which was adopted after discussion by the Board on February 20, 1996.&#13;
IDA Lending Experience&#13;
1.19   Since 1973, IDA has financed a total of 24 agriculture and rural development projects and five&#13;
fisheries projects in Yemen and thus has considerable lending experience in the sector. At present, six&#13;
projects are under implementation. IDA financed projects in the sector have been of two main types: area&#13;
development projects, including five successive projects in the Tihama region, three in the Southern&#13;
Highlands, three in Wadi Hadramawt and others in Beihan, Al Jawf, Central Highlands, Northern Region and&#13;
Eastern Region; and national projects (research and extension, credit, land and water conservation etc.). On&#13;
the whole, area development projects have been more successful than national ones. The principal lessons&#13;
learned from lending experience can be summarized as: (i) good management is key - poor management&#13;
skills, weak management structures and cumbersome procedures have been the principal cause of project&#13;
failure; (ii) beneficiary participation helps improve performance - top down designs have usually had&#13;
weak impact; (iii) Government commitment is vital - where sector ministry partners have not been&#13;
committed to projects, implementation and impact have been poor; and (iv) projects should be simple -&#13;
complex designs have proved very hard to implement in the Yemen environment.&#13;
1.20  In recent years, IDA has been very active in addressing project implementation constraints. These&#13;
were addressed by decisions at the 1995 and 1996 Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPR), in&#13;
particular: simplification of procedures for procurement; denomination of local contracts in convertible&#13;
currencies; streamlining of disbursements; and improvements in management through competitive&#13;
recruitment of staff on contract at market salaries.&#13;
1.21   At the start of FY98, the portfolio in agriculture and natural resources contained six projects, of which&#13;
one is currently (September 1997) rated unsatisfactory: The National Agriculture Sector Management Project&#13;
is rated unsatisfactory on Development Objectives because, although implementation is satisfactory, the&#13;
overall environment of poorly-performing public services has made it more difficult to translate increased&#13;
capacity in sector institutions into improved service delivery at farmer level. Under the project, a process has&#13;
3Report 15718-YEM, August 31, 1996&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Southern Governorates Rural Development Project                                              5&#13;
now been launched to prioritize public service interventions in agriculture and to reallocate resources to the&#13;
delivery of essentially public services such as research and extension. Once the process of prioritization and&#13;
reallocation is underway, it will be justifiable to uprate the project; this is expected before the end of 1997.&#13;
Another project, Wadi Hadramawt III, was rated unsatisfactory until the most recent supervision (June 1997).&#13;
The project suffered from difficult cofinancing arrangements; one cofinancing loan was canceled early in the&#13;
project life, and another was not declared effective for six years, until the cofinancier unilaterally canceled the&#13;
loan in June 1997. As cofinancing arrangements were essential to implementation of the largest project&#13;
component (agricultural development), the project could not achieve its original objectives. However, the&#13;
principal component that has been actually implemented - spate irrigation improvement - has been successful,&#13;
mobilizing widespread community participation and exceeding quantitative targets. The project development&#13;
objectives were revised and the project is now rated satisfactory. The Credit will close in September 1997.&#13;
1.22   In order to ensure improved implementation, Government and IDA have agreed that each project has&#13;
to be designed as simply as possible in such a way that it can deliver benefits in a cost-effective and&#13;
sustainable way within a weak-capacity and low-budget public sector environment. The proposed project thus&#13;
incorporates: autonomous project management; maximum private sector and beneficiary participation; simple&#13;
cofinancing arrangements; and a clear vision of how post-project sustainability is to be achieved.&#13;
D. Project Area&#13;
1.23   The project area comprises five regions in four southern governorates of Yemen - these are (see map): (i)&#13;
Wadi Hadramawt in Hadramawt Governorate; (ii) Coastal Hadramawt in Hadramawt Govemorate; (iii)&#13;
Meifa'a/Ataq in Shabwa Govemorate; (iv) Ja'ar/Zinjibar/Ahwar in Abyan Govemorate; and (v) Al Hawta in&#13;
Lahej Govemorate. These regions contain a high concentration of dispossessed tenants and other rural poor (see&#13;
para. 1.14 ff). The five project regions are generally arid, with low and erratic rainfall. Natural resources&#13;
throughout the project area are limited, although oil has been discovered in the eastern part of the area.&#13;
Agriculture is the mainstay of the rural economy, with artisanal fisheries an important activity on the coast.&#13;
Despite the generally harsh environment, the area and its population still have untapped development potential:&#13;
(i) water resources in some areas, notably in Wadi Hadramawt and in major wadis in Shabwa and Abyan; (ii)&#13;
coastal fisheries resources; (iii) a tradition of enterprise and a generally higher level of education and skill than in&#13;
the rest of the country; and (iv) real potential for the development of cultural tourism.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Preparation and Design&#13;
Project Preparation&#13;
2.1    Government requested IDA assistance with the project in 1994. The first step in project identification&#13;
was a participatory needs assessment (PNA) that consisted of a series of systematic on-site consultations&#13;
(governorate by governorate) with the key local actors - both the dispossessed tenants and the returning&#13;
owners. The PNA was conducted to give these key stakeholders a voice in project design, to assess the&#13;
economic and social problems that had resulted from the dispossession process, and to identify both&#13;
individual and community level solutions.&#13;
2.2    Building on the results of the PNA, the project was identified during a joint Government/IDA mission&#13;
in January 1995. The basic methodology of this mission - and of subsequent field missions - was&#13;
participatory. Extensive consultations were held with communities, sub-groups and individuals in order to&#13;
understand the problems and the development opportunities, and to incorporate the proposals of potential&#13;
beneficiaries and of central and local government into project design. The result was a project proposal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                      Southern Governorates Rural Development Project&#13;
directed at rural poverty with an accent on cost effective implementation, participation and rapid benefits for&#13;
the poor. The components identified were: development of irrigated land; promotion of off-farm enterprise;&#13;
and community development activities.&#13;
2.3    The second step in project preparation was reconnaissance level studies under Japan PHRD grant&#13;
financing to screen areas proposed for irrigation development and to assess, through a variety of participatory&#13;
methodologies, the technical, social and institutional conditions for a project. This level of studies was&#13;
completed by the end of 1995, and confirmed the feasibility of the project proposal. Water resource&#13;
availability was checked by both site investigation and analysis of the wealth of existing data on water&#13;
resources, and sites where water resource sustainability was not clear were eliminated. The key issue at this&#13;
stage concerned doubts about the tenure of the land sites allocated by the government for development under&#13;
the project. Many claims had been lodged, alleging that these were private, rather than government, lands,&#13;
and it was necessary to assess these claims before a decision could be taken by government and IDA to&#13;
proceed.&#13;
2.4    By early 1996, government had begun the process of resolving claims and had decided to guarantee&#13;
the allocation of land developed under the project to poor small farmers on a freehold basis. As a result,&#13;
government and IDA took the decision to proceed with full-scale preparation. This was conducted through a&#13;
joint govemmentlconsultant team, with the consultant contract financed by a Japan PHRD grant. The&#13;
preparation team was in the field from April to August 1996, working continuously with communities and the&#13;
target population, and with representatives of central and local governments. The preparation report was&#13;
produced in October 1996; and a joint Government/IDA mission carried out a preappraisal mission in&#13;
November 1996. The preappraisal (i) defined the nature and scope of benefits to be delivered to project&#13;
beneficiaries; (ii) broadened the project's target population to include some of the poorest rural community&#13;
members residing in the project areas, even though they were not dispossessed; (iii) specified the non-land-&#13;
related project components; and (iv) launched the work of a "Committee for the Selection of Beneficiaries"&#13;
that used an innovative methodology of prompting the communities themselves to create the lists of&#13;
benefiting families, through a self selection process done jointly with the Committee.&#13;
2.5    Following pre-appraisal, the Bank-wide Operations Committee (OC) discussed (December 1996) this&#13;
project, in view of its unusual nature and important poverty reduction content, and fully endorsed its rural&#13;
poverty focus and innovative participatory approaches. The OC also instructed the appraisal mission to seek&#13;
from Government a legal decision to formally end the process of dispossession. As a condition of&#13;
negotiations, Government issued a decree that permanently halts the process of dispossession. The appraisal&#13;
took place in March 1997 and its results are presented in this report.&#13;
Project Design&#13;
2.6    The following paragraphs explain the reason for the choice of components and their integration in the&#13;
overall social design and implementation strategy.&#13;
2.7    Priority to Land-Based Poverty Alleviation.  Sustainable poverty alleviation requires the&#13;
development of income-producing assets and skills rather than temporary income transfer. Best practice has&#13;
shown that the surest means of restoring incomes for impoverished rural people is land development. The&#13;
impoverished population in the target group are all from a farming background and most of them are recently&#13;
dispossessed farmers (para. 1.14). Not surprisingly, the PNA and all the subsequent project preparation work&#13;
revealed that the dispossessed and other poor had an overwhelming preference for land-based support, if&#13;
available. This component was therefore a priority in project design. However, the scope of the component&#13;
was limited by the lack of sufficient water resources and by the high cost of water development in some areas,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Southern Governorates Rural Development Project                                             7&#13;
and hence other non-land-based development components have also been developed in order to reach as many&#13;
of the rural poor in the project area as possible at the least cost possible.&#13;
2.8    Non Land-Based Poverty Alleviation.  Throughout the preparation process, Government and&#13;
beneficiaries alike clearly expressed a preference - if there was not enough land in the project - for other rural&#13;
based poverty alleviating investments (rather than migration to towns). In situ poverty alleviation is certainly&#13;
lower cost. Most of Yemen's towns are suffering from rapid and uncontrolled expansion and from growing&#13;
physical constraints, notably in water supply and sanitation. The preparation process, therefore, focused on&#13;
working with the target group to identify profitable or potentially profitable enterprises in the rural sector for&#13;
which there is both a market and an interest on the part of the target group. This led to the inclusion in the&#13;
project of support to livestock (familiar to and practiced by most beneficiaries, scope for low cost animal&#13;
husbandry and health improvements identified, and ready sale market particularly in the fast growing coastal&#13;
towns); fisheries (a well-organized sector with good potential for sustainable extra production and a fast-&#13;
growing market both locally and in the highlands, with competitive market organization, good availability of&#13;
credit and equipment, and a working institutional support structure); new, farm-related activities (well-suited&#13;
to ex-farmers and complementary to the land development component of the project) and rural-based&#13;
handicrafts (a large unsatisfied potential market, well-suited to home production by women). In the case of&#13;
livestock and fisheries, the preparation process continued into a "subsector analysis" which identified specific&#13;
bottlenecks that the project could remove in order to help realize potential for the benefit of the target group.&#13;
In the case of these two subsectors, specific subcomponents have been designed. For other subsectors, and&#13;
building on the methodology, the project will conduct a series of such "subsector analyses" during&#13;
implementation - these analyses are pragmatic, hands-on exercises that will enable project staff (through a&#13;
participatory methodology) to identify bottlenecks and show where the project can effectively intervene.&#13;
2.9    Community Involvement. A clear finding of the PNA and of subsequent preparation work is that the&#13;
community has a responsibility and interest in poverty alleviation. Hence design brings in communities in the&#13;
selection of beneficiaries, in getting the community to acknowledge Government title to the land sites and to&#13;
agree to the allocation of these lands to the poor amongst their own community, and in the identification of&#13;
opportunities for non-land based poverty alleviation. The same logic led to the community development&#13;
component which involves the broader community in the project and brings benefits to the community as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
2.10   A "Business" Approach to Project Management. Throughout the preparation period there was&#13;
skepticism evident about the capability of a project to affect the problem of rural poverty. Rural people - and&#13;
Government officials - tended to see a project as a series of inputs that were placed in the hands of the&#13;
Government rather than as a set of outputs and impacts on the real problem. This perception, which is largely&#13;
based on past experience, led to proposals for project implementation which provide for a temporary, light&#13;
and efficient structure run on "business" lines, with low overhead and focused on the impact on the target&#13;
group. Beneficiary involvement in monitoring the efficiency of project management according to service&#13;
delivery standards to be developed by the project management would provide one of the checks on the&#13;
effectiveness of the proposed "business" approach.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
2.11    Within the overall CAS objectives (para. 1.17), the specific development objectives of the project&#13;
are:&#13;
(a)   to raise the incomes of about 8,750 very poor rural individuals and their families (50-60,000&#13;
people) in the southern govemorates of Yemen sustainably above the poverty level;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                       Southern Governorates Rural Development Project&#13;
(b)   to promote overall economic and social development in the approximately 40 extended rural&#13;
communities (up to about 150,000 people in total) in the which the target population under (a)&#13;
reside and in which there is a very high concentration of poor people; and&#13;
(c)   to test innovations regarding the involvement of beneficiaries in planning and implementation&#13;
and regarding a business approach to project management.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
2.12   The detailed project description is in Annex 1. Project components are summarized in the following&#13;
paragraphs.&#13;
Land Allocation and Development or Rehabilitation (base cost US$24.8 million)&#13;
2.13   This component would comprise a series of activities designed to establish about 1,950 very poor&#13;
landless families within the target communities in sustainable new farming operations on about 3,900 ha.&#13;
About 3,150 ha would be newly developed and about 750 ha would be rehabilitation work on former state&#13;
farms. Subcomponents would be: (i) land allocation - assignment of secure title for lands to be developed or&#13;
rehabilitated under the project to poor rural families, largely dispossessed; (ii) land development and&#13;
rehabilitation - about 3,900 hectares of irrigated land would be developed or rehabilitated, and water&#13;
monitoring set up or reinforced; and (iii) farmer services - training and extension (delivered by professionals&#13;
on a contract basis), help to access credit for equipment and inputs, and material support to farm&#13;
establishment.&#13;
2.14   About three quarters of the land (2,900 ha) comprises specific sites which have been appraised from&#13;
the technical, economic, social and legal standpoints. Government has formally certified that these sites are&#13;
free from claim, are state property and would be assigned irrevocably in freehold to project beneficiaries&#13;
(subject to certain covenants that would ensure that the beneficiaries used the land for the purpose intended -&#13;
see Annex 1). Action on this was a condition of negotiations. About one quarter (1,000 ha) is land that was&#13;
added to the project only at negotiations when cofinancing for its development under the IDA-supported Wadi&#13;
Hadramawt III Project (para 1.21) was canceled. The technical and economic characteristics of this land are&#13;
equivalent or superior to the land that has been fully appraised, and detailed studies will be completed in the&#13;
first year of the project. The same selection criteria and Government certification procedures (detailed in the&#13;
Manual of Procedures) will be applied as for existing sites. In the event of any sites proving unsatisfactory,&#13;
there are ample alternatives. During negotiations, assurances were received from Government that it would:&#13;
(i) demarcate all sites in accordance with the Manual of Procedures, and exclude lands with valid claims from&#13;
development under the project; and (ii) grant to beneficiaries freehold title on individual plots before land is&#13;
developed. In order to ensure that land is allocated to the poorest and that the community fully accepts and&#13;
endorses the allocation, a participatory process to select beneficiaries has already been conducted and about&#13;
two thirds of the beneficiary farmers have been selected. The sustainability of water resources on these sites&#13;
has been thoroughly checked and doubtful sites have been excluded. Groundwater monitoring in the project&#13;
area would be strengthened, and all project wells would be metered.&#13;
2.15   The following investments would be financed under this component: drilling wells; equipment of the&#13;
wells with pumps and engines; water conveyance and distribution systems; land leveling; farm establishment,&#13;
including leaching, deep ploughing, canal construction, tree planting and soil amendment; contract services&#13;
for extension and training during the initial years of farming; technical assistance and equipment for&#13;
groundwater monitoring; and engineering and supervision services, including vehicles and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Southern Governorates Rural Development Project                                             9&#13;
Off-farm Income Development (base cost US$5.0 million)&#13;
2.16   The component would comprise three sets of activities to provide assistance to poor people to set up or&#13;
develop very small or small businesses or to acquire the technical skills training needed to find remunerative&#13;
employment. The interest of the target group to take up these opportunities has been established through the&#13;
participatory preparation process. The component would comprise three sets of activities: (i) livestock&#13;
development - training and equipment in animal health and care to about 500 poor villagers, at least half of&#13;
them women, to enable them to set up as simple animal health providers ("paraveterinarians") - this activity&#13;
has been successfully piloted by a GTZ-financed project in the southern govemorates; (ii) fishing&#13;
development - training and equipment of about 280 new entrants to the profitable fisheries business on the&#13;
south coast; and (iii) promotion of other revenue-earning services and micro-enterprise. This activity&#13;
would provide assistance to: (a) establish start-up micro and small enterprisesI (MSEs); (b) assist already&#13;
existing MSEs; and (c) provide technical skills training in areas where employment opportunities exist. While&#13;
being poor is the overriding characteristic of the target group, opportunities for income generation would vary&#13;
based on individual characteristics, geographical areas, and community infrastructure. Phased&#13;
implementation of MSE development and technical skills training would occur based on findings of subsector&#13;
analysis and market studies as well as community dialogue. The project would pilot activities in both&#13;
financial and non-financial service delivery (the former executed on contract by other agencies, including the&#13;
Social Fund for Development). Because there is little experience within the project areas in MSE&#13;
development, a number of approaches would be used. As experience is gained, methods and activities would&#13;
be adjusted accordingly.&#13;
2.17   Investments would be: technical assistance contracts to provide training; apprenticeships; minor&#13;
equipment for trainees (such as initial kits of drugs and instruments for the paraveterinarians, or nets and&#13;
ropes as teaching aids for the fishermen); workshops and visits to other enterprises locally; the costs of&#13;
operating a group of business development advisers; technical assistance; and vehicles and equipment.&#13;
Economic and Social Development of Rural Communities (base cost US$6.8 million)&#13;
2.18   This component is aimed at the social and economic development of the 40 target communities as a&#13;
whole. The component would comprise two sets of activities. The first is development of community&#13;
management skills and institutions - the project would provide training and minor logistical support to&#13;
community organizations around specific projects of economic or social importance to the local community.&#13;
This would be backed up by the second component - a community development fund to finance small grants&#13;
for community projects on a cost sharing basis - spate irrigation, water supply and sanitation, a community&#13;
center, or flood protection works are some typical projects. Only communities where there was no land&#13;
development would have access to the community development fund. Investments would be in project staff,&#13;
vehicles and equipment, in training materials, in visits to other community projects; in workshops for the&#13;
communities, and in the grant fund.&#13;
Preparation of Future Projects (base cost US$1.0 million)&#13;
2.19   Investment would be in technical assistance and training to help prepare future projects in the sector,&#13;
including possible projects for irrigation improvement, field services and animal health.&#13;
1     A common definition of MSEs includes a wide range of enterprises (services, transport, agriculture, manufacturing) ranging&#13;
from part time, seasonal activities of a single person to small, formnal enterprises employing several non-family members.&#13;

EI[. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Management Arrangements&#13;
Business Approach&#13;
3.1    The project design provides for an innovation in management arrangements that can best be described&#13;
as a "business approach". Under this approach, the Government has created by Decree of December 1996 the&#13;
Project Management Unit (PMU, see para. 3.3 below) as a temporary autonomous legal entity with powers&#13;
and a structure equivalent to those of a private business. This was a condition of negotiations. The reason for&#13;
this business approach is to ensure that the project starts up rapidly and is implemented at lowest possible cost&#13;
with the maximum direct benefits being delivered in a timely and efficient manner to the beneficiaries - the&#13;
rural poor. The PMU will exist to achieve specific targets over the project period, and would be dissolved at&#13;
the end of the project. Low management overhead would be a key performance indicator, not exceeding 10&#13;
percent of project cost (compared to rates of 20 percent and upward experienced in projects in the sector that&#13;
have been implemented through ministries).&#13;
Steering Committee&#13;
3.2    By Decree of December 1996, Government created the project steering committee chaired by the&#13;
Minister of Agriculture. This was a condition of negotiations This committee has powers and functions&#13;
equivalent to the Board of Directors of a company. The steering committee comprises representatives (at&#13;
Deputy Minister level or equivalent) of MAWR, MOPD and the Governor's office in each of the four&#13;
governorates concerned. The committee would meet regularly twice a year, once in April to review and&#13;
approve the project annual report and audited accounts for the preceding year and once in about September to&#13;
review the draft budget and work program for the following year. The committee would ensure that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                   Southern Governorates Rural Development Project&#13;
implementation was carried out according to the manual of procedures (para. 3.3 ) and would approve the&#13;
appointment of the senior staff (para. 3.11 ff). Meetings of the steering committee would be in the project&#13;
governorates and in Sana'a in turn.&#13;
Project Management Unit&#13;
3.3   The PMU would have its headquarters at Seiyun, the principal town of Wadi Hadramawt, where the&#13;
largest regional share of project activities is located. The PMU would have the structure, powers, functions&#13;
and responsibilities of company management. The organization chart, terms of reference of staff and the&#13;
procedures of the PMU are laid down in a manual of procedures, the final version of which was agreed at&#13;
negotiations and which is in the project file. All PMU professional staff (22 in total) would be recruited on&#13;
contract after competition and would be paid salaries at market rates. Staff recruited who already held posts&#13;
in another institution, whether public or private, would have to resign or take long-term leave without pay.&#13;
Employment with the project would be full-time but fixed term. All staff would be liable to termination if&#13;
their services were considered inadequate.&#13;
3.4   The PMU would be headed by a project director with overall responsibility for planning,&#13;
implementation and reporting. Under the director, the PMU would comprise four groups, plus advisory staff:&#13;
(i) the participatory development group, headed by a senior community development specialist&#13;
(internationally recruited); (ii) the business development group, headed by a senior business development&#13;
adviser; (iii) the engineering group, headed by a senior engineer (internationally recruited); and (iv) the&#13;
finance and administration group, headed by afinance manager.&#13;
3.5   Participatory Development Group.  The group leader, the senior community development&#13;
specialist, would work from headquarters but would travel widely. The group's focus would be entirely field-&#13;
oriented with five participatory development coordinators (PDCs) resident in the project regions (one each in&#13;
Seiyun, Mukalla, Ataq, Zinjibar and Al Hawta). The PDCs would have front line responsibility, as&#13;
representatives of the project to the communities, would manage the community development component and&#13;
would coordinate overall implementation in their region of responsibility. With five PDCs and 40&#13;
communities, each PDC would work in about eight communities. The number of PDCs has been deternined&#13;
based on an analysis of the tasks they would have to undertake.&#13;
3.6    Business Development Group. The group leader, the senior business development adviser, would&#13;
work from headquarters but would travel widely. Four business development advisors (BDAs) would be&#13;
resident in the field (in Mukalla, Ataq, Zinjibar and Al Hawta) and responsible for implementing the off-farm&#13;
income development component (para. 2.16 and Annex 1). This would include: (i) conducting subsector&#13;
analyses and implementing interventions; (ii) liaising with credit projects/institutions and advising client&#13;
groups on accessing credit; (iii) providing business andlor marketing training and information; and (iv)&#13;
facilitating all aspects of technical skills training. Because micro- and small-enterprise development activities&#13;
are almost non-existent in Yemen, the project would contract with an international agency or firm with&#13;
relevant experience in the region to train the BDAs.&#13;
3.7   Engineering Group. The group leader, the senior engineer, would work from headquarters but&#13;
would travel widely. The senior engineer would have overall responsibility for supervising preparation of&#13;
final design and for overseeing contract implementation for all land development activities. Two (civil)&#13;
engineers would be posted in the field (Seiyun, and either Ataq, Meifa'a or Zinjibar) to supervise&#13;
implementation of the land development component.&#13;
3.8   Finance and Administration Group. The Finance and Administration Group would be based in&#13;
headquarters.  Under the Finance Manager, the group would comprise an accountant, a liaison&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Southern Governorates Rural Development Project                                         13&#13;
officer/clearing agent and a procurement officer. The Finance Manager would have overall responsibility&#13;
for the financial management and accounts of the project, including disbursements of the IDA Credit. The&#13;
accountant would be responsible, under supervision of the Finance Manager, for keeping records of&#13;
disbursements and the special account, and for preparing disbursement requests.&#13;
3.9   In addition to the four groups, there would be three other senior staff reporting to the Project Director:&#13;
an agricultural adviser to back up the field program in farming and livestock: a women-in-development&#13;
adviser to back up the PDCs and BDAs on gender and to ensure the integration of women's support in all&#13;
aspects of the project; and a monitoring and evaluation specialist to provide feedback to enable headquarters&#13;
and field staff to learn in a positive environment from both success and failure. A series of consultancies&#13;
would be available to back up the project team in areas where a full time staff member is not justified.&#13;
3.10   All staff would either have experience or demonstrated interest in participatory social development&#13;
approaches, and training in these approaches would be given to all staff early in their service. All professional&#13;
staff would be highly mobile and provided with the best available communication facilities. Government&#13;
would provide office space in the different regions for liaison purposes, but field staff would be expected to&#13;
spend at least 90 percent of their time in the field. Headquarters staff would be expected to travel about half&#13;
of their time.&#13;
3.11   The appointment of the senior professional staff (project director, group leaders, senior headquarters&#13;
staff) would be subject to IDA approval. Terms of reference for all staff were agreed at negotiations. A&#13;
project manager satisfactory to IDA has been appointed. The appointment of the four group leaders would be&#13;
required by December 31, 1997, and of five participatory development coordinators, four business&#13;
development advisers, a procurement officer, an economic adviser, a women-in-development adviser, and a&#13;
management and evaluation specialist by March 31, 1998. Assurances to this effect were received at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
Work Programming&#13;
3.12   The PMU will prepare Annual Work Programs for presentation through the Steering Committee to&#13;
IDA for approval before November 30 of each year. Assurances on this were obtained at negotiations. The&#13;
draft program for the first year of the project was agreed at negotiations.&#13;
Implementation and Contract Services&#13;
3.13   The project's three components would make up a "menu" offered by the PDCs during the community&#13;
dialogue process. Not all activities would be conducted in each community; it would depend on local&#13;
opportunities and community and individual requests. After dialogue within the community, the activities to&#13;
be implemented in each community would be agreed and the activities implemented as follows:&#13;
(a)    Land Allocation and Development. Allocation would be conducted by Government with&#13;
PMU support (both the participatory development group and the engineering group).&#13;
Preparation of detailed designs would be conducted by consultants under supervision of the&#13;
engineering group. Tendering and supervision for land development would be conducted by&#13;
the engineering group, execution would be by contractors. Crop development activities&#13;
(training, extension, physical works) would be carried out through contractors, with the PMIUJ&#13;
(agricultural adviser) responsible for tendering and supervision.&#13;
(b)    Off-Farm Income Development. The paraveterinarian  activity would be executed by a&#13;
contractor, with PMU responsible for tendering and supervision. The fisheries activity would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                   Southern Governorates Rural Development Project&#13;
be executed by the business development group, with the formal training done under contract&#13;
by the Fisheries Institute in Aden. The subsector analysis and the management of the&#13;
resulting interventions would be executed by the business development group. The business&#13;
training activity would be executed by the business development group. The technical&#13;
training activity would be executed by the business group, with the formal training done&#13;
under contract with VTCs and other training institutions. The microfinance pilot activity&#13;
would be implemented under contract by SFD, and the small enterprise credit pilot would be&#13;
implemented under contract by SEDU.&#13;
(c)    Economic and Social Development of Rural Communities. The development of community&#13;
management skills activity would be implemented by the participatory development group.&#13;
The community development fund activity would be implemented by the participatory&#13;
development group working directly with communities (see Annex I for a detailed&#13;
description of implementation arrangements), with works executed under contracts tendered&#13;
and supervised by the participatory development group.&#13;
(d)   Preparation of Future Projects in the Sector. This component would be executed by the&#13;
MAWR Directorate General of Planning and Monitoring.&#13;
3.14  It is estimated that a total of about 100 contracts would be managed during the project period, ranging&#13;
from major civil works and equipment supply contracts, through contracts with international specialist&#13;
organizations (e.g., with an international NGO for the paraveterinarian activity), down to local level contracts for&#13;
extension and training (contracts would be signed with consultants or with other local professionals of&#13;
demonstrated ability -- those working in the public sector would be required to take leave of absence during their&#13;
contract). It is expected that the use of contract services would prove much lower cost and more flexible and&#13;
speedy than the recruitment and training of a large cadre of PMU staff. However, it is experimental in Yemen&#13;
and would be closely observed during early supervision in order to ensure that the system is manageable and&#13;
giving the expected results. Design and management of performance criteria would be critical and the skills&#13;
needed for this would be key to the selection of PMU staff.&#13;
Credit&#13;
3.15   Beneficiaries receiving land would be responsible for their own working capital and equipment needs&#13;
beyond the costs of farm establishment. As beneficiaries are poor, it is expected that credit would be&#13;
required. Most formal rural credit is presently supplied by the parastatal Cooperative and Agricultural Credit&#13;
Bank (CACB). No special credit fund is proposed under the project. Instead, project field staff would work&#13;
closely with beneficiaries in order to help them to prepare well-structured credit applications either to CACB&#13;
or to other credit institutions present in the project area. As the financial sector is presently undergoing&#13;
reform as part of the overall adjustment program, it is expected that the offer of credit for well-structured&#13;
projects backed by freehold land collateral would increase. For the fisheries component, there is adequate&#13;
finance available in the existing Fisheries IV revolving fund, and credit for the project fisheries component&#13;
would therefore be handled through the existing fund without any special provisions under the project.&#13;
Finance for very small and small enterprises would be provided through the pilot programs to be run by SFD&#13;
and SEDU (para. 3.13).&#13;
Operation and Maintenance&#13;
3.16   The proposed typical Irrigation Unit (IU) for groundwater irrigation development would consist of 60&#13;
feddans divided among 12 farming families, with 5 feddans each. Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of the&#13;
irrigation systems will be managed by Water User Associations (WUAs), which would be organized and&#13;
supervised by the PMU. Operation of wells and day-to-day maintenance would be carried out by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Southern Governorates Rural Development Project                                         15&#13;
beneficiaries through arrangements established by the WUAs. Initial training in the operation of wells would&#13;
be given to the WUAs. More complicated technical maintenance work should be carried out by technicians&#13;
under the supervision of the PMU and the concemed WUAs. The same above procedures would be applied&#13;
also for O&amp;M of the spate irrigation scheme in the areas of Meifa'a State Farm which would included under&#13;
the Project.&#13;
3.17   Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the PMU would: (i) submit a plan for operation&#13;
and maintenance for each groundwater irrigation scheme to IDA for review by December 31, 1998; (ii)&#13;
submit a plan for operation and maintenance of the spate irrigation scheme to IDA for review by December&#13;
31, 1999; (iii) assist the water user associations to review and revise by December 31 of each year the charges&#13;
set by each WUA to ensure that they cover all operation and maintenance costs and submit that to IDA for&#13;
review; (iv) cause the irrigation systems under the Project to be maintained and inspected periodically in&#13;
accordance with sound engineering practices, under arrangements satisfactory to IDA; and (v) prepare and&#13;
submit to IDA by December 31, 1998 a water management program for the spate irrigation scheme that will&#13;
be included under this project to ensure that the irrigation system (headworks and distribution system) will&#13;
serve efficiently and equitably present and new owners in this site.&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
3.18   Procurement authority would be as agreed at the 1995 CPPR: the project director would approve&#13;
contracts up to US$200,000 and the Minister of Agriculture would approve contracts US$200,000 to US$ 1.0&#13;
million. Any contract awards beyond that level would be approved by the High Tender Board (US$1.0 - 3.0&#13;
million) or the cabinet (procurements over US$3.0 million).&#13;
3.19   Principal items to be procured under the project would be: civil works - land development contracts;&#13;
equipment - pump equipment, vehicles; and services - technical assistance and a broad range of support&#13;
activities, as described above (paras. 2.12 ff, and 3.13).&#13;
3.20  IDA will act as IFAD's cooperating agency, and will administer disbursements and procurement for&#13;
IFAD financing. Procurement of goods and works would be according to IDA Procurement Guidelines&#13;
(January 1995). ICB would apply: for goods of a contract value above US$200,000, and civil works of a&#13;
contract value above US$1 million. Contracts for works below US$1 million and goods between US$50,000&#13;
and US$200,000 would be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB). Goods estimated to cost&#13;
less than the equivalent of US$100,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$750,000&#13;
may be procured through intemational shopping Goods estimated to cost less than the equivalent of&#13;
US$50,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$250,000 may be procured through&#13;
national shopping. All bidding packages for works, equipment, materials and vehicles estimated to cost&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent or more would be subject to prior IDA review of procurement documentation. Other&#13;
contracts would be subject to ex-post review after the contract award. These limits would result in prior&#13;
review of about 75 percent of total IDA financing and about 90 percent of IDA financing of contract works by&#13;
ICB and NCB covering some 25 contracts. An exception to the above would be procurement for the IFAD-&#13;
financed community development component, amounting to less than US$2.0 million, which would include&#13;
community participation and provision of grants for community projects in water supply and sanitation,&#13;
community centers, flood protection works and other local community infrastructure. Goods and works&#13;
required for these activities shall be procured in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA. A second&#13;
exception would be for procurement of small works under both the off-farm income and community&#13;
development components. Works for these components estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 equivalent&#13;
per contract, up to an amount not to exceed US$4.0 million equivalent, may be procured under lump-sum,&#13;
fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in&#13;
response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including&#13;
&#13;

basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA, and relevant&#13;
drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation&#13;
for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to complete the contract successfully.&#13;
Services for consultants, training, and studies would follow the Guidelines for Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants (January 1997). Two training contracts for support to the livestock component and to the&#13;
business development activity would be procured through international competition under the Quality and&#13;
Cost Based Selection Process. All other contracts are expected to cost less than $100,000 and would follow&#13;
the selection process based on consultants' qualifications and the process for selecting individual consultants.&#13;
All contracts for the employment of consultants estimated to cost $100,000 equivalent or more for consulting&#13;
firms and $50,000 equivalent or more for individual consultants would be subject to IDA's prior review. All&#13;
other contracts would be subject to ex-post review by IDA. Procurement procedures were agreed at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;

C. Disbursements, Accounts and Audits&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
3.21   The credit would be disbursed over an estimated six and a half years. The disbursement profile is&#13;
based on the standard disbursement profile in the MENA region, adapted to the particular features of the&#13;
proposed project. IDA would not finance the costs of land nor any tax or tax element. The closing date for&#13;
the Credit would be June 30, 2004. The Project Preparation Advance would be refunded from the Credit upon&#13;
effectiveness. Disbursements would be by category as follows:&#13;

3.22   Disbursement for contracts for civil works, goods and services to be made on the basis of statements&#13;
of expenditure for expenditures would be as follows: (i) civil works under contracts of less than US$1 million&#13;
equivalent; (ii) goods under contracts of less than US$200,000 equivalent; (iii) contracts for consulting&#13;
services not exceeding US$100,000 equivalent; (iv) contracts for individual consultants and training not&#13;
exceeding US$50,000 equivalent; and (v) operating costs under such terms and conditions as the Association&#13;
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. All other disbursements would be fully documented.&#13;
Special Account&#13;
3.23   To facilitate d;sbursements, a Special Account of value US$500,000 (equivalent to about four months&#13;
of cash flow for the relevant expenditures) would be established in a commercial bank in Seiyun. Assurances&#13;
to this effect were received at negotiations.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.24   The Project Management Unit (PMU) would be responsible for project budgeting and accounting. The&#13;
PMU would install accounting and budgetary management information systems, to be operational at the start of&#13;
the 1998 financial year. Systems would incorporate intemal controls and checks. Accounting and procurement&#13;
monitoring will be computerized. The Finance Manager and his group (para. 3.8) would be responsible for&#13;
developing these systems, with input from the monitoring and evaluation specialist on the management&#13;
information systems. The Finance Manager and his group would prepare the chart of accounts and the&#13;
accounting manual, and will be responsible for producing monthly statements on expenditure against budget, on&#13;
the special account and on disbursements on sub-projects. The group will produce the annual accounting&#13;
statements ready for audit within two months of the year end. All these statements will be made available to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                    Southern Governorates Rural Development Project&#13;
Steering Committee and to IDA. The PMU would seek any necessary consultant support and finance is provided&#13;
for this under the project.&#13;
3.25 PMU autonomy needs to be balanced by internal controls and external supervision. Project accounts&#13;
would be audited by private auditors from a national or international accounting firm, selected by the Steering&#13;
Committee and subject to the approval of IDA. Assurances to this effect were received at negotiations. The&#13;
auditor will be selected before the start of the 1998 financial year and terns of reference will be agreed withIDA.&#13;
The project's audited accounts and the auditors' report would be submitted annually to the Steering Committee.&#13;
The committee would take note of the auditors' report before passing on the report and the audited accounts to&#13;
IDA, within six months of the end of the accounting period. It is expected that the firm selected would also&#13;
provide accounting system design support to the PMU, including help with the initial system design.&#13;
D. Monitoring, Supervision and Evaluation&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
3.26   Monitoring of project implementation and impact would be continuous throughout the project. The&#13;
basis would be the key performance indicators developed in the design summary (Annex 1), which were agreed&#13;
at negotiations. The detailed monitoring framework would be designed and supervised by the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation specialist. The finance manager and the M&amp;E specialist would be jointly responsible for the&#13;
Management Information System (MIS). Monitoring by the beneficiary target groups of project execution and&#13;
impact would be built in from the start, involving at least one formal meeting a year in each community.&#13;
3.27  In order to track the impact of the project on incomes and welfare at the household level, a limited&#13;
number of families would be monitored regularly throughout the project by the M&amp;E system set up by the&#13;
project's M&amp;E Specialist.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
3.28   A project launch workshop would be held shortly before the expected date of effectiveness. This&#13;
would provide "just in time" training in procurement, disbursement, accounting, auditing and management&#13;
procedures. Thereafter, regular IDA supervision would take place every six months, according to a&#13;
supervision plan that was worked out at appraisal (see Annex 10). Supervision would be led from the Yemen&#13;
Resident Mission, with support from headquarters. This will allow close and frequent follow-up, particularly&#13;
in the initial stages of the project. Supervision resources required are estimated at 25 weeks in FY98, and&#13;
thereafter 18 weeks annually, with a special provision of additional resources in FY 2001 to conduct the&#13;
proposed mid-term review (para. 3.29). At least once a year, supervision missions would contain a financial&#13;
analyst to verify procedures and give some hands-on training.&#13;
Mid-Term Review&#13;
3.29  In view of its novel implementation methodology and to allow for redesign and adjustment of project&#13;
inputs and components, a mid-term review should take place late in the third year of the project (target date -&#13;
November 2000). It would involve a social scientist specialised in participatory approaches, specialists in&#13;
irrigation, finance, project management, off-farm/SME, and others according to need. The mid-term evaluation&#13;
would examine the status of project execution and impact. It would also canvas the opinions of a representative&#13;
sample of beneficiaries. As necessary, it would propose restructuring or reallocation of funds and propose&#13;
methodological changes for the continuation of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Southern Governorates Rural Development Project                                             19&#13;
Impact Evaluation&#13;
3.30   Impact evaluation by an independent monitoring team would be conducted towards the end of the&#13;
project implementation period. It would be appropriate to repeat the exercise about eight or nine years after&#13;
project start up, i.e., two or three years after completion. The basic reference would be the development&#13;
objectives and the related performance indicators listed in the design summary. Ways in which the second&#13;
impact evaluation would be conducted and financed (the evaluation would be well after the IDA Credit had&#13;
closed) would be examined during implementation and decided at the time of the first evaluation.&#13;
Completion Report&#13;
3.31   Not later than six months after the completion of the project, the Govemment would submit to IDA a&#13;
Project Completion Report summarizing the achievements of the project and its impact vis-a-vis objectives.&#13;
Assurances on this were obtained at negotiations.&#13;
E. Cost Recovery&#13;
3.32   Beneficiaries would contribute about US$4.1 million (11 percent of project costs) to cover half the cost&#13;
of irrigated farm establishment, pumps and engines for irrigation. The quantum to be recovered has been set at&#13;
15 percent of net income (a level that is affordable by the averagely performing farmer on the lowest yielding&#13;
project land site (the worst case scenario). During the work of the Committee for the Selection of Beneficiaries,&#13;
the cost recovery provision proved a practical means of identifying able and suitable candidates, as only those&#13;
with the necessary management skills were prepared to accept land on these terms. Capital repayments would be&#13;
made over fifteen years with three years grace commencing from the start of the farming operations. The&#13;
Government shall appoint a financial institution satisfactory to the Association to collect the mortgage payments.&#13;
The repayments would be made to an escrow account according to a legally enforceable schedule contained in a&#13;
covenant to the land title. The funds in the escrow account would be used for local community projects. In the&#13;
event of default and after exhausting all possible remedies, the defaulting beneficiary would be obliged to&#13;
surrender the land, which would then be reallocated to a fresh beneficiary according to the same criteria and&#13;
process as used in the original allocation. Assurances on this were received at negotiations.&#13;
F. Project Sustainability&#13;
3.33   Sustainability of project interventions would be assured through the following main characteristics of&#13;
the project: (i) land development would only take place on sites where water availability is sustainable (see&#13;
para 4.12 and paras 4.19-4.20) and the basic knowledge for sustained, profitable farming is available; (ii) cost&#13;
recovery would ensure the commitment of beneficiaries and would ensure the financial sustainability of the&#13;
water user associations; (iii) the off-farm component would be market-driven - all activities would aim at&#13;
ensuring sustainability of the micro- and small enterprises established through finance, business and technical&#13;
support; (iv) institutionally the project would achieve sustainability through the provision of the necessary&#13;
support to community organizations to enable them to manage their affairs more efficiently by the end of the&#13;
project; and (v) the training and experience gained by the participatory development coordinators in the&#13;
project unit would create a small pool of experienced staff whose capacity could be used by other projects in&#13;
the country in the future, thus promoting the practice of participatory rural development in Yemen. Similarly,&#13;
the business development advisors would be in an excellent position to strengthen and support SEDU or SFD&#13;
after the project, thanks to the experience and training gained through their work in the project. The project's&#13;
organization/management arrangements, however, are not intended to endure beyond project end.&#13;
Sustainability here is intended primarily at the level of the target beneficiary group.&#13;
&#13;

IV. BENEFITS, RISKS AND IMPACTS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
Quantified Benefits&#13;
4.1    The project would supplement the means of economic livelihood for about 8,750 very poor&#13;
individuals and their families (50-60,000 people), together with improvements in welfare arising from&#13;
community development activities for a total of up to 150,000 people. The farm units of 2 ha would generate&#13;
incomes of between $2,600 and $4,000 per farm family, varying according to the crop mix (2 ha has been set&#13;
as the size that can be managed by a family and that provides a good income). These incomes are based on&#13;
conservatively estimated yields and prices for the area (e.g. onions 15-18 t/ha, tomatoes 10-15 tlha, sesame&#13;
0.6-1.2 t/ha), and on cropping intensities of 90-110 percent, which are below best practice in the region. For&#13;
the fisheries component, annual fish catch per boat is expected to be 28 tons (based on experience with&#13;
existing fishing operations under the ongoing Fisheries IV project), generating incomes in excess of $3,000 a&#13;
year for 280 poor families. Other revenue-earning enterprise activities (business advice, skills training, credit,&#13;
etc.) are expected to provide greater surety of income and new-found employment or business for about 6,000&#13;
beneficiaries. Three quarters of them are expected to attain annual earnings of between $500 and $1,000 a&#13;
year. Improvements in women's animal husbandry are expected to generate annual income of about $185,000&#13;
throughout the project area, supplementing the incomes of many women. The figure for other-revenue&#13;
earning activities are based on information on the local market collected during preparation.&#13;
Non-Quantified Benefits&#13;
4.2    Benefits from the Community Development Component. The benefits from the community&#13;
development component would include better community relations; greater ability to deal successfully with&#13;
the authorities to obtain services and support; improved health due to repair and rehabilitation of domestic&#13;
water supplies and drainage systems; and benefits from environmental awareness and actions. Although these&#13;
benefits are largely non-quantifiable, the success of this component would be evaluated in the scheduled&#13;
community monitoring meetings (para. 3.26).&#13;
4.3    Other Benefits. The project is intended to pioneer two new approaches to rural development in Yemen.&#13;
First, although there have been some pilot projects to test participation approaches to rural development, the&#13;
proposed project would be the first full-scale project in Yemen to work in partnership with rural communities.&#13;
Second, the proposed "business" approach to project implementation (para. 3.1) would test a new solution to the&#13;
problems of implementing rural development projects in Yemen. If these approaches are successful, there would&#13;
be an important benefit in the lesson for future projects.&#13;
B. Economic and Financial Evaluation&#13;
4.4   The full economic analysis is set out in Annex 3. Using the above projected benefits and the project&#13;
costs, and allowing for periodic asset replacements, individual components have the following EIRRs:&#13;
Land Allocation and Development (various sites)&#13;
- new land development                         9.17-16.57 percent&#13;
- rehabilitation                               21.89-28.19 percent&#13;
Livestock                                             19.64 percent&#13;
Fisheries                                            179.79 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Southern Governorates Rural Development Project                                                   21&#13;
4.5    For the land allocation and development component, the analysis was conducted separately for each&#13;
region and type of development, with a cut-off ERR of 10 percent.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
4.6    A sensitivity analysis was conducted on key project risks. The sensitivities modeled correspond to the&#13;
risks discussed in Section C. below. The analysis has been carried out only on the land development&#13;
component as: (i) this is the largest component subject to cost benefit analysis; (ii) the risks impact&#13;
predominantly on this component; and (iii) some of the ERRs for this component are close to or at the cut off&#13;
point. The risks modeled are:&#13;
Risk                  Description of Risk Modeled                    ERR range&#13;
-       Base case                                                  9-28%&#13;
#1       Divergence of 5% p.a. between official and market exchange rates  negative - 17%&#13;
(macroeconomic risk)&#13;
#2       Civil works costs increase by 30% (project complexity)     4-24%&#13;
# 3      Crop benefits decrease by 25% (water resources risk)       negative - 18%&#13;
# 4      Pumping costs increase by 50% (water resources risk)       2-21%&#13;
# 5      Farms in service decrease by 20% (land tenure risk)        5-23%&#13;
# 6      Cropping intensity reaches 1.0 only after five years (farm  9-28%&#13;
productivity risk)&#13;
The results of the sensitivity analysis show that for all but one of the risks modeled, some of the land&#13;
development component ERRs would drop below 10 percent This underlines the importance of: (i) the&#13;
mitigating and risk-avoiding measures that have been built into the project and which are discussed in Section&#13;
C below; and (ii) the need for close monitoring of all parameters throughout implementation (see para 3.26 ff)&#13;
for details).&#13;
Financial Evaluation&#13;
4.7    The financial rates of return to the project are in the range 15-187 percent (see Project File). Incomes&#13;
accruing to project beneficiaries would be adequate to raise all beneficiaries significantly above the poverty line&#13;
(estimated at US$85/person/year). A cost-effectiveness comparison between the proposed "business" approach&#13;
to project implementation and the alternative of implementing the project through a regular Government agency&#13;
shows that the proposed "business" approach would save about 60 percent on overhead in comparison to the&#13;
alternative (this was estimated by analysing the cost of MAWR executing the project through its Provincial&#13;
Departments of Agriculture; the calculation includes assumptions about implementation delays and cost overruns&#13;
that are based on actual experience in public sector-implemented projects in Yemen).&#13;
C. Risks and Issues&#13;
4.8    Macroeconomic Risk. The following are the main specific macroeconomic assumptions that would&#13;
condition success (see project design summary in Annex 1): (i) continued macroeconomic stabilisation; and (ii)&#13;
continued Government support for a decentralised rural poverty alleviation program as a major development&#13;
goal. Indications are that these assumptions are realistic and do not present a high risk. The macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                                     Southern Governorates Rural Development Project&#13;
stabilization program is on track and Government is negotiating a new facility with the IMF and a new&#13;
adjustment operation with IDA. Nonetheless, the macroeconomic context is vital. The sensitivity analysis below&#13;
shows the impact of just one macroeconomic parameter going off track (Risk # 1 models the impact of a&#13;
divergence between official and market exchange rates). Although this risk presently appears unlikely to&#13;
materialise, the results of the sensitivity analysis underscore the need for careful monitoring and for sustained&#13;
dialogue at the macroeconomic level in order to provide an enabling environment for the project to succeed.&#13;
4.9    Regarding Government support for decentralized rural poverty operations, Government has worked&#13;
actively with NGOs and donors on poverty alleviation and has made a commitment to major operations for&#13;
poverty alleviation (paras 1.8 and 1.12). There is a strong historic tradition of decentralised self-management and&#13;
community involvement in the development process, and this is reinforced not only by Government's present&#13;
policy and practice but also by a strong self-help movement from communities themselves. Donors at the recent&#13;
Consultative Group meeting showed strong support for this approach, and are backing it up with several&#13;
externally-financed initiatives in the way of decentralised and community led development. The risk that this&#13;
approach will not be sustained are therefore small.&#13;
4.10   Institutional Risk. Experience with IDA projects in the rural sector has been mixed, with problems of&#13;
both implementation and sustainability. The implementation strategy for the proposed project goes a long way to&#13;
reduce this risk - relying upon a demand-driven, field-oriented way of working; a "business approach" to&#13;
management with properly paid and qualified staff; decentralization in implementation; transparency and&#13;
accountability; and autonomy from over-bureaucratic procedures. However, the implementation design involves&#13;
innovative experiments and would require political commitment and good management to make it work.&#13;
Government has endorsed the proposed approach, and has acted decisively to create the steering committee and&#13;
the PMU, and to appoint the project director (para 3.1 ff). At the local level, the governors for the project areas&#13;
are committed to quick results on the ground. The early appointment of the project director will help to get early&#13;
results, so that the project could generate its own momentum of support.&#13;
Project Level Risks and Their Resolution&#13;
4.11   Project Complexity. One of the lessons from IDA lending experience has been that project design&#13;
should be as simple as possible. The sensitivity analysis (para 4.6) shows the possible impact of project&#13;
complexity leading to delays and cost increases (Risk # 2 modelled), and project design therefore focused on&#13;
maintaining as simple a design as is consistent with achieving project objectives and on ensuring workable&#13;
management arrangements. During preappraisal and appraisal, components of the proposed project were&#13;
reduced (the fisheries component) or eliminated (a proposed traditional building component) and the resulting&#13;
project has, in fact, a simple structure and a manageable implementation strategy. The key features are:&#13;
community dialogue and involvement as the unifying mechanism for project activities; the business approach to&#13;
project management; and implementation through contractors under supervision rather than by a heavy in-house&#13;
capacity. Although the project is spread geographically across five separated regions, this is nonetheless a viable&#13;
project area as the project intervenes in a finite number of communities (40) and staff are mandated to be highly&#13;
mobile and to use all means of communication (including the recently reintroduced cellular telephones, together&#13;
with fax, radio etc.). The project is thus manageable, provided the PMU is endowed with the powers and&#13;
attributes described in Chapter III. This again underlines the essential nature of the conditionality attached to the&#13;
PMU (para. 3.1 ff).&#13;
4.12   Risks Regarding Water Resources. Water scarcity is a major constraint in Yemen, and the economic&#13;
consequences on the project if water were to be insufficient or if pumping costs were to increase are very&#13;
striking (see Risks # 3 and 4 in the sensitivity analysis, para 4.6). Therefore, close attention was paid to the issue&#13;
throughout the preparation and appraisal process. Availability of sustainable water has been a prime factor in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Southern Governorates Rural Development Project                                          23&#13;
determining the sites which have been adopted for land development. During identification and preparation, site&#13;
investigations were carried out and the large number of existing studies of water resources and data collected by&#13;
public agencies were analyzed, including the nationwide Water Resources Assessment of Yemen (General&#13;
Department of Hydrogeology, with Netherlands Government aid), the survey of Wadi Hadramawt resources&#13;
(Murdoch McDonald, IDA-financed) and numerous local and regional surveys. As a result, Lahej governorate&#13;
was excluded from land development activities and only limited areas were selected in Abyan and Shabwa.&#13;
Further work was done at appraisal, when the mission included a hydrogeologist. Subsequent work published on&#13;
Hadramawt from a Canadian consultant study (KOMEX) confirms the adequacy of sustainable water in that area.&#13;
Based on these existing studies, new field work and expert opinion, sites have only been included where&#13;
extraction of water is sustainable. Proposed development of water resources under the project has been discussed&#13;
with the National Water Resources Authority (NWRA), which is responsible for approving water resource uses.&#13;
In addition, support is being provided under this and other projects for water monitoring and management.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government (through NWRA) would (i) submit to IDA by&#13;
December 31, 1998 and prepare a plan to control groundwater development in the project areas and limit&#13;
abstraction of each aquifer to those recommended by the available hydrological studies, and (ii) submit to IDA&#13;
by January 31 of each year an annual report on groundwater monitoring and assessment for each of the project&#13;
areas. More specific measures are discussed below (para. 4.20).&#13;
4.13   Risks Regarding Land Tenure. In the fluid conditions that prevailed in the southern govemorates&#13;
after unification and the civil war of 1994, there were many land claims. Notwithstanding the multiple&#13;
precautions taken during project preparation to deal with claims, and to drop sites where title was seriously&#13;
contested, under the Constitution of Yemen, citizens are always entitled to lodge claims, however speculative.&#13;
The sensitivity analysis carried out on the project rate of return (para. 4.6) shows that if problems over land&#13;
tenure were to reduce the number of farms in service (Risk #5 in the sensitivity analysis), project viability&#13;
would be at risk. However, this risk has been minimized by the actions of Government in clearing claims and&#13;
asserting and assigning freehold title, and also by the community validation procedure followed to select&#13;
beneficiaries (para. 2.14). This process has gone as far as possible to reduce the risk that further claims are&#13;
made on the lands once allocated, as there is both a formal declaration and assignment of a clean title&#13;
underwritten by government and a community commitment to the agreed distribution. Two further steps have&#13;
been built in to ensure that no claims could be made on land once developed. First, the sites would be&#13;
demarcated, further announcements made in the newspapers, and any resulting claims would be adjudicated&#13;
before the tender for development is launched. Second, Government would grant freehold title on plots to&#13;
beneficiaries before land is developed (para. 2.14).&#13;
4.14   Risks Regarding Farm Productivity. As beneficiaries receiving land are poor, they may be risk&#13;
averse and also have problems of access to investment and working capital. In addition, there is a risk that&#13;
markets may not be steady or able to absorb output, particularly high value produce. These risks could&#13;
threaten the economic justification of the project, as shown by Risk # 6 in the sensitivity analysis (para. 4.6).&#13;
These risks would be avoided by the emphasis placed on support to farmers in the early years of farming to&#13;
provide training, access to inputs and credit. The high grade contract extension services would help farmers&#13;
to prepare professional business plans matching produce to markets, and would ease fanner access to bank&#13;
financing. This risk also reinforced the case for farmers to share in the costs (para. 3.32), in order to ensure&#13;
that they have the incentive to earn the maximum possible return from their farming. Finally, the allocation&#13;
of land to beneficiaries on a freehold basis (para. 2.14) would both increase farmer incentives and ease access&#13;
to credit.&#13;
Remedies&#13;
4.15   Risks have been thoroughly analyzed and minimizing, avoiding and mitigating measures have been&#13;
deployed. Monitoring of all critical assumptions and risks would be continuous throughout the project period&#13;
(through project monitoring and evaluation, supervision missions, mid-term review, independent evaluation).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                     Southern Governorates Rural Development Project&#13;
In the event that these or other risks nonetheless threaten implementation, and the government would not&#13;
implement agreed upon solutions, then remedies would be employed, going from restructuring to cancellation.&#13;
Alternatives Considered and Strategic Choices&#13;
4.16   During identification and preparation the following alternative design elements were considered and&#13;
rejected:&#13;
(a)  no land development - because of the comparatively high cost of land development, the possibility&#13;
of a project without land was considered. This was rejected by Government and IDA because: (i)&#13;
the target population were farmers and knew best how to farm; (ii) the process of consulting&#13;
beneficiaries threw up an overwhelming preference for land; (iii) despite high cost, land&#13;
development offered the most assured and stable return of any component (and it had an&#13;
acceptable rate of return); and (iv) land development was seen by both Government and&#13;
communities as an "anchor" that held together the other project interventions.&#13;
(b) development of private lands and their transfer to beneficiaries - because many of the returning&#13;
owners were not interested in farming, the preparation and appraisal missions examined the&#13;
possibility that the project might invest in rehabilitation of private lands and their transfer to&#13;
beneficiaries. However, this proved impracticable as it would have involved either Government&#13;
purchasing the land from the owners - which was against public policy - or a long term mortgage-&#13;
style arrangement whereby beneficiaries would have committed themselves to capital repayments&#13;
to owners over an extended period before they received clear title. As the term of this&#13;
arrangement would have gone well beyond the life of the IDA Credit, IDA and Government&#13;
considered that the guarantees that the landowners would honor their side of the bargain were&#13;
inadequate. However, at negotiations, it was agreed that consultant services would be retained&#13;
under the project to investigate whether this approach could be tested on a pilot basis, with&#13;
appropriate safeguards to protect the beneficiaries.&#13;
(c)  implementation of the off-farm and community development components through another&#13;
agency - at the time of appraisal, the new Social Fund for Development was being set up, and the&#13;
mission reviewed the feasibility that implementation of these two components could be transferred&#13;
to the Social Fund which had similar objectives and activities. However, the management of the&#13;
Social Fund decided against this option as it was itself an embryonic institution and was unwilling&#13;
to take on extensive field commitments. Instead, it was agreed that the two projects would&#13;
cooperate in fields of mutual interest, and that the Social Fund would implement one pilot activity&#13;
for the Southern Governorates Project (microfmance pilot) as this was a field in which the Social&#13;
Fund had competence and experience.&#13;
D. Social Impact&#13;
4.17   The project is expected to have a direct impact on the socio-economic status of poor people in&#13;
particularly poor areas. This target group has been well defined (in the Participatory Needs Assessment (para.&#13;
2.1) and improvements would be monitored regularly during and after the project development period (para. 3.26&#13;
ff). In addition to specific monitorable changes in incomes and welfare, the community development component&#13;
is expected to contribute to the reintegration and social and economic development of generally poor&#13;
communities fragmented by the changes of recent years. The project does not involve any resettlement, as&#13;
selection of beneficiaries for the land development has included proximity to the site as one of the selection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Southern Governorates Rural Development Project                                            25&#13;
criteria. The project is not expected to affect tribal peoples nor any related traditional grazing rights on any&#13;
significant scale; in fact, most of the beneficiaries live within the tribal system, and would therefore profit. Any&#13;
impact on traditional grazing rights would be assessed during the demarcation procedure (para. 2.14) and&#13;
appropriate compensation made, but this impact is expected to be minimal or non-existent.&#13;
4.18   The project would have a particular impact on women through targeting of specific components under&#13;
the direction of the women-in-development adviser (para. 3.9). Targeting would include: women's role in&#13;
livestock care, where at least half of the "paravets" trained (250) are expected to be women; and women's role in&#13;
other off-farm activities where a number of handicraft activities would be developed and promoted specifically&#13;
for women. For all relevant activities, there would be special training arrangements for women. Half of those to&#13;
receive training in technical skills (1,500) are expected to be women.&#13;
E. Environmental Impact&#13;
4.19   The project carries a number of moderate environmental risks, especially with respect to water&#13;
management, sustainable land use, and sustainable farming practices. The subprojects under the community&#13;
development fund subcomponent would have summary environmental assessments and, where relevant,&#13;
mitigation plans. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.&#13;
Water Management&#13;
4.20   The availability of groundwater is a major constraint in Yemen and groundwater availability has been&#13;
a major factor in designing the land development component. In addition to the safeguards discussed above&#13;
(para. 4.12), project development would be phased at one site (Khabt al Asloom), in order to assess the water&#13;
situation before completing the scheme. No groundwater development would take place in coastal&#13;
Hadramawt or in Lahej where water resources are limited and mainly fulfilling urban demand. In addition, in&#13;
order to assess water use and flow, and to encourage farmers in sustainable water use, the project would&#13;
require and finance water meters on the wells drilled under the project.&#13;
4.21   The drilling of deeper wells brings a risk of contamination of lower aquifers through leakage from&#13;
surface water or the higher aquifer. The risk would be mitigated through careful site selection and through&#13;
requiring the sealing off the upper aquifers by concrete/grout casing through the upper aquifers and stainless&#13;
steel casing. Well design would be approved by IDA, and execution of well drilling, casing and welding&#13;
would be carried out by licensed drilling companies and carefully supervised by project staff, government&#13;
(including local water monitoring units) and international consultants.&#13;
Sustainable Land Use&#13;
4.22   The major environmental risks of farming at the southern governorates are salination of farm land and&#13;
wind erosion. In many areas, the salt levels in well water are moderate to critical and do not allow leaching.&#13;
Sites where serious risks of salination cannot be mitigated, have therefore been excluded from the project. In&#13;
general, the risk would be managed through training of farmers in irrigation management and in leaching&#13;
practices. Wind erosion would be reduced through careful monitoring of new constructions in irrigated fields&#13;
and through planting wind-breaks.&#13;
Sustainable Farming Practices&#13;
4.23   High productivity farming in the arid conditions of the southern governorates requires careful on-farm&#13;
husbandry, particularly soil and water management. The risk cf sub-optimal farming practices would be&#13;
mitigated by training, both through extension and on-site training for farmer groups. The project would not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                                                     Southern Governorates Rural Development Project&#13;
finance pesticides and would encourage the use of integrated pest management techniques. Efforts to enhance&#13;
animal health and care would increase efficiency of production and decrease non-productive use of grazing&#13;
and water resources.&#13;
Biodiversity&#13;
4.24   The project would have a minimal effect on biodiversity. The emphasis on traditional practices in&#13;
field school- and paravet training, as well as on bee-keeping as an off-farm activity, would increase&#13;
appreciation for plant and animal biodiversity, and would enhance the respect for traditional knowledge&#13;
systems.&#13;
4.25   The fisheries component would not affect the threatened coastal lobster population. Increased coastal&#13;
fishing, by providing and equipping a limited number of boats, is not expected to have a measurable impact&#13;
on the small (sardine, mackerel) and large pelagic (tuna, sharks, etc.) fish population.&#13;
Archeological Sites&#13;
4.26   The project is not expected to provide a risk to archeological sites. One proposed irrigation site was&#13;
in fact eliminated as it threatened an archaeological site, and others were dropped to avoid affecting the water&#13;
table in the cities in the region. Water use near or upstream of these sites would be monitored through the&#13;
water meters installed on newly drilled wells. It is expected that there may be some positive impact on the&#13;
Naqb al Hajr historic site, by better land management adjacent to the site.&#13;

SOUTHERN GOVERNORATES RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Land Allocation and Development (Base cost US$ 24.9 million)&#13;
1.    This component would comprise a series of activities designed to establish about 1,950 very poor&#13;
landless families in sustainable new farming operations on about 3,900 ha.&#13;
2.    Land Allocation. This would comprise the assignment of secure title for lands to be developed&#13;
or rehabilitated under the project to poor rural families, largely those who were dispossessed under&#13;
Yemen's reprivatization of farm land. The process of ensuring that the state has clear title to the lands to&#13;
be developed under the project has been a major activity (and success) of the project preparation process.&#13;
Government has issued a decree that formally certifies that the lands are free from claim, are state&#13;
property and are assigned irrevocably in freehold to project beneficiaries. Action on this was a condition&#13;
of negotiations. As a next step, Government will demarcate the sites, place further announcements in the&#13;
newspapers, and adjudicate any claims arising, informing IDA of its actions. In addition, before any&#13;
particular land site is developed under the project, Government will grant freehold title on each assigned&#13;
plot to the beneficiaries. The freehold would be subject to covenants that would ensure that the&#13;
beneficiaries would use the land for the purpose intended' . The criteria and process for selecting&#13;
beneficiaries of the land have been worked out to ensure that land is allocated to the poorest amongst&#13;
capable farmers and that the community fully accepts and endorses the allocation. The selection criteria&#13;
are: (i) poverty recognized by the community; (ii) proximity of dwelling to the site proposed; (iii) ability&#13;
to farm the land effectively; and (iv) willingness to enter into the obligations accompanying the title,&#13;
including the cost recovery obligations. A participatory process of selecting beneficiaries and obtaining&#13;
community validation has been conducted, and about two thirds of the beneficiary farmers have already&#13;
been selected on 22 sites in three governorates . The balance of the beneficiary farmers will be selected&#13;
closer to the time when land development begins.&#13;
3.    Land Development and Rehabilitation. About 3,900 hectares of irrigated land would be&#13;
developed or rehabilitated. About three quarters of the land (2,900 ha) comprises specific sites which&#13;
have been appraised from the technical, economic, social and legal standpoints. About one quarter&#13;
(1,000 ha) is land that was added to the project only at negotiations when cofinancing for its&#13;
development under the IDA-supported Wadi Hadramawt III Project was canceled. The technical and&#13;
to cultivate the land themselves, or with the help of nuclear family members;&#13;
- not to drill any shallow wells, individually or in smaller groups;&#13;
- to participate in irrigation network operation and maintenance, and in the activities and decisions of&#13;
their WUA according to the terms decided by the irrigation group;&#13;
- not to sell the land for a period of a minimum of 10 years;&#13;
- not to use the land for non-agricultural purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
economic characteristics of this land are equivalent or superior to the land that has been fully appraised,&#13;
and detailed studies will be completed in the first year of the project. The same selection criteria&#13;
(detailed in the Manual of Procedures) will be applied as for existing sites. In the event of any sites&#13;
proving unsatisfactory, there are ample alternatives. In fact, total land allocated to the project, prima&#13;
facie Government land free of claims and which is technically and economically viable, is considerably&#13;
more. In the event that any problem arose with any proposed project site before development another&#13;
site could thus be substituted.&#13;
4.    New Land Development would include the drilling of wells, the equipping of the wells with diesel&#13;
pumps and engines, the conveyance of water from wells to fields and the levelling of fields. Reclamation of&#13;
some lands which are sandy or saline would be needed.&#13;
5.    The average base cost per hectare of new land development is about $6,200. Well depths would&#13;
vary between sites, averaging 160 m (with up to 40m screen length per well) in Wadi Hadramawt, 70 m&#13;
in Shabwa and 87 m in Abyan. Well design will be based on diligent supervision at every stage of well&#13;
construction, development and test pumping. Sites in Wadi Hadramawt average 60 ha; those in Shabwa&#13;
are over 200 ha each; and those in Abyan over 400 ha each. Each beneficiary would receive a plot of 2&#13;
hectares size, which is adequate to maintain an average family. Farms would be arranged around wells,&#13;
with each well serving 5 -12 farms. Farmers would be organized in small groups and would cooperate in&#13;
operating and maintaining the wells, pumps and equipment, which would be the property of the group as&#13;
a whole. The group would also be responsible for all future capital replacements.&#13;
6.    Land rehabilitation would comprise about 750 hectares already developed for irrigation and&#13;
which was previously farmed by government as "state farms". The land to be rehabilitated is located on&#13;
three old "state farms" in Hadramawt Governorate, ranging in size from 130 ha to 385 ha.. The average&#13;
rehabilitation cost per ha is $880/ha. Land would be allocated in 2 ha plots as for new land, but&#13;
arrangements for farmer organisation and for operation and maintenance would vary by site depending on&#13;
the nature and layout of the irrigation system. One site, for example, has a number of wells discharging into&#13;
a main canal which serves relatively large farm areas; in this situation, all the farmers in the command area&#13;
would have to organise themselves to take responsibility for management of the system.&#13;
7.    There is an urgent need to resume regular and systematic groundwater monitoring at all well sites in&#13;
the Wadi Hadramawt region and to support ongoing monitoring programs in other project areas. This will&#13;
be done through the existing monitoring units and under the coordination of the National Water Resources&#13;
Authority (NWRA). In Wadi Hadramawt, the existing monitoring unit at Seiyun would be strengthened. In&#13;
the other two governorates, the monitoring units set up under the Land and Water Conservation Project&#13;
would conduct the monitoring..&#13;
8.    Crop Development. Support to crop development will be organized to help the new owners to&#13;
establish themselves. This support would include training and extension, help to access credit for&#13;
equipment and inputs, and material support to farm establishment, including leaching, deep ploughing,&#13;
canal construction, tree planting and soil amendment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Off-Farm Income Development (Base cost US$ 5.0 million)&#13;
9.    This component would comprise three sets of activities designed to create sustainable sources of&#13;
income for poor rural people within the target communities in activities for which they have a comparative&#13;
advantage and for which there is a market. The interest of the target group to take up these opportunities&#13;
has been established through the participatory preparation process.&#13;
10.   Support for Livestock Development. Many poor landless people, particularly women, survive&#13;
from the income from livestock rearing, and this component is designed to increase the productivity of&#13;
livestock and the incomes from it. The component would provide simple training in animal health and&#13;
care to about 500 poor villagers, at least half of them women, and provide each person trained with a&#13;
minimal "care" package of some equipment and medicines. The trained villagers would act as&#13;
"paraveterinarians" and would provide services both to their own animals and to other livestock owners&#13;
in their village; they will charge for their services, and gain full- or part-time employment.&#13;
Replenishment of medicines can be done through the market. International experience, and some limited&#13;
experience in Yemen, have shown that this activity should bring high pay-offs.&#13;
11.   Support for Fishing. Artisanal fishing is an important and profitable occupation of a large part&#13;
of the rural population along the coast. Some of the project target group - poor young landless farmers -&#13;
have indeed already taken up fishing, but there are constraints to entry and the project intends to&#13;
stimulate further employment generation in the fisheries sector. The component would select and train&#13;
about 280 participants in fishing skills and arrange for their practical "apprenticeship" with established&#13;
fishing boats. Initially, participants will receive six weeks of basic skill training in classes held in five or&#13;
six locations on the coast. Each class will contain 20-40 students and be led by an experienced instructor&#13;
with one or two assistants. After completing this basic course, the students will be assigned to work with&#13;
existing fishermen as apprentices, with the boat owner receiving a modest fee to take and train the&#13;
newcomer. The apprenticeship program would last one to two years, depending on individual&#13;
arrangements. Two week long training courses in advanced topics would be held for the students after&#13;
about 12 and 18 months of apprenticeship. Upon successful completion of the apprenticeship program,&#13;
the students would be eligible to participate in the revolving credit schemes established under the IDA&#13;
and IFAD-financed Fisheries IV Project (Cr. 2265-YE) in order to purchase their own boats and gear.&#13;
An international technical expert has been included to develop a training curriculum and monitor the&#13;
quality of the program. The local fisheries cooperative will administer the apprenticeship program. The&#13;
program would be limited to the south coast in areas west of Mukalla. This is because in Mukalla, and&#13;
east of there, ample opportunities exist for alternative employment. In Shabwa, some rehabilitation of&#13;
on-shore facilities will be necessary, and it is expected that this work will be carried out in the context of&#13;
the Fisheries IV Project.&#13;
12.   Promotion of Other Revenue-Earning Services and Enterprises. This component would&#13;
provide assistance to beneficiaries to set up or develop very small or small businesses ("micro and small&#13;
enterprises", MSEs, or to acquire technical skills training they need to find productive employment.&#13;
While being poor is the overriding characteristic of the target group, opportunities for income generation&#13;
would vary based on individual characteristics, geographical areas, and community infrastructure.&#13;
Phased implementation of MSE development and technical skills training would occur based on findings&#13;
of subsector analysis and market studies as well as community dialogue. The project would pilot&#13;
activities in both financial and non-financial service delivery. Because there is little experience within&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
the project areas in MSE development, a number of approaches would be used. As experience is gained,&#13;
methods and activities would be adjusted accordingly.&#13;
13.   The component would comprise four activities:&#13;
(a)    Analysis and development of economic subsectors that have particular promise for&#13;
absorbing new rural entrants. This is an upstream activity that will help define the other&#13;
three activities, and would also lead to specific project interventions. Priority subsectors&#13;
are those which include large numbers of the target population or subsectors which are&#13;
growing and offer opportunities for the target population. Examples of possible priority&#13;
subsectors include garnent manufacturing (large number of women), building&#13;
construction (growth potential), wool products (large number of target population&#13;
rearing sheep and producing wool products), handicrafts (large number of women), and&#13;
specific agricultural commodities important in the project areas. Types of interventions&#13;
might include developing market linkages (between MSEs and a larger enterprise),&#13;
facilitating subcontracting relationships, forming trade or business associations to&#13;
provide lower cost material sourcing, specific skill training, etc. The identification of&#13;
priority subsectors and the management of project interventions would be done by&#13;
project staff.&#13;
(b)   The second project activity under this component would be to provide basic business&#13;
training/information. Many of the project's target population are unemployed or&#13;
without skills or have no experience in how to start a business or develop a business&#13;
idea. In addition, some project clients would receive technical skills training and will&#13;
want to use this training to start-up their own enterprise and be in need of basic business&#13;
training. This business training would be offered in group formats for cost-effectiveness&#13;
and will initially use course materials that have been used successfully in the region or&#13;
other countries. Project staff would directly manage this activity.&#13;
(c)    During project preparation, communities expressed demand for a number of businesses&#13;
for which they believed there was a local market and which would require technical&#13;
skills training if the target population were to gain employment or start MSEs. The third&#13;
activity under this component would therefore be technical training. This provides&#13;
opportunities for apprenticeships combined with intensive short-term training During&#13;
project implementation, community and market assessments will further define the&#13;
potential for specific technical training activities. The project would contract with&#13;
existing vocational training centers (VTCs) and other training institutes in the project&#13;
area to deliver training, as well as with private businesses willing to provide&#13;
apprenticeship and/or employment opportunities.&#13;
(d)    The fourth activity to be conducted under this component would be to pilot the&#13;
development offinancial services for off-farm activities. The provision of MSE credit&#13;
has been shown to be an effective way of increasing the incomes and assets of poor&#13;
people worldwide. In Yemen, the unmet demand for MSE finance has been estimated by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 5 of 11&#13;
the well-established Small Enterprise Development Unit (SEDU)I and by others to be&#13;
very strong. Microfinance (finance in the range of US$50-US$1,000) can assist in the&#13;
start-up or growth of microenterprises needing little capital or training. In addition,&#13;
many potential enterprises which were identified during the preparation process require a&#13;
larger investment, generally in the $1,000-$3,000 range (as well as technical/business&#13;
training). Typically, this investment might finance the purchase of tools or a machine.&#13;
Therefore, two types of pilot projects are planned: microfinance (which includes&#13;
savings) and small enterprise credit. To leverage other resources, the project will&#13;
contract with other institutions which have an advantage for piloting MSE finance&#13;
activities in the project area: the Social Fund for Development (SFD) for a microfinance&#13;
project (advantage is that SFD wishes to invest in building the capacity of their staff in&#13;
this field) and SEDU for small enterprise lending (advantage is that SEDU has&#13;
experience and is planning on building a nationwide capability).&#13;
14.   Up to 3000 project clients (half of them women) will receive technical skills training. At least&#13;
seventy percent of these clients are expected to initiate (or expand) MSEs or obtain employment through&#13;
skills training. Over 1300 clients will receive business training (both those that receive technical skills/&#13;
apprenticeship training and those that do not). Over 3000 clients are expected to receive microfinancial&#13;
services and another 200 or more clients will receive small loans. Other subsector interventions are&#13;
expected to benefit at least 500 project clients (through provision of lower cost inputs, for examnple).&#13;
Important project benefits include the development of sustainable MSE finance activities, as well as the&#13;
testing and development of MSE training materials in the project areas.&#13;
15.   One problem with starting a new program in off-farm income generation is that there is so little&#13;
experience in Yemen that inevitably the costs will be high. Therefore, the design of the component takes&#13;
into account other existing capacity wherever possible, to keep costs down. Thus, in the financial&#13;
services activity, it is proposed to pass contracts with the two other institutions that have capacity: with&#13;
SFD (which is gaining expertise in building sustainable microfinance institutions) and SEDU (which has&#13;
a good track record in small enterprise finance lending). Similarly, the project will work with VTCs (in&#13;
Mukalla, Seiyun, Ja'ar, Zinjibar, Aden) to provide technical skills training. These VTCs are already&#13;
being  supported under IDA  and GTZ projects, and are developing good capacity.  Project&#13;
apprenticeships and short-term training workshops will be done in local communities and in group&#13;
situations thereby reducing costs. Off-the-shelf MSE development materials will be used whenever&#13;
possible.&#13;
Economic and Social Development of Rural Communities (Base cost US$6.8 million)&#13;
16.   This component would comprise a series of activities aimed at the social and economic&#13;
development of poor communities as a whole. During project implementation, about 40 broad&#13;
communities would be selected for support. Selection criteria would include: (i) high concentration of&#13;
dispossessed tenants and other poor people; (ii) willingness to participate in the project and work within&#13;
the participatory methodology; and (iii) (where possible) the presence of an existing community&#13;
SEDU was set up in 1990 under donor assistance as the small enterprise arm Industrial Bank of&#13;
Yemen. It is now becoming autonomous and is expanding into operations outside the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;

organization, e.g., a management committee for a domestic water supply scheme. With respect to the&#13;
project, communities are defined as individual large villages with populations over 2000 people or a&#13;
group of hamlets and smaller villages.  Communities so defined would have the following&#13;
characteristics: (i) a total population of 200 to 800 households; (ii) longest walking distance between the&#13;
hamlets included not to exceed one hour; (iii) social cohesion, i.e., there being no current or known&#13;
history of significant conflicts or disagreements between the hamlets; ard (iv) populated by people from&#13;
the same social stratum or strata, with known good relationships.&#13;
17.   Development of Community Management Skills and Institutions. The project would provide&#13;
training and minor logistical support to community organizations around specific projects of economic or&#13;
social importance to the local community. This could be backed up by the community fund described&#13;
below. Typical projects might include: development of village water supply and sanitation; maintenance&#13;
or rehabilitation of community infrastructure, whether productive (irrigation systems, terraces, etc.) or&#13;
social (schools, health clinics, etc.); and community environmental protection and awareness programs.&#13;
18.   A Community Development Fund. Of the 40 communities with which the project would work,&#13;
it is estimated that approximately 25 would not benefit from land development. These 25 communities&#13;
would have access to a grant fund (up to US $100,000 per community) to finance community projects on&#13;
a cost sharing basis. Through the participatory process, the needs of the communities would be&#13;
established and communities would make a request for financing from the project. Priority would be&#13;
given to investments directly supporting economic development (spate irrigation construction and&#13;
rehabilitation, community workshops, women's workshops/centers, marketing centers, etc.). Second&#13;
priority for project funding would go to environmentally relevant investments (domestic water and&#13;
drainage supply, flood protection structures, waste disposal, etc.) while third priority would be given to&#13;
direct social infrastructures (health centers or education facilities).&#13;
19.   Project field staff would negotiate directly with the community to reach agreement on a&#13;
subproject. Technical aspects would be prepared with support from project staff or consultants and the&#13;
proposal would finally be approved by project management according to rules set out in the Manual of&#13;
Procedures (usually from the engineering group). These rules would establish the criteria for acceptance&#13;
which would include the following:&#13;
-     that subprojects are of high value and benefit to the entire community;&#13;
-     that no subgroup within the community would benefit disproportionately from the&#13;
investment funded by the project;&#13;
-     that there is adequate commitment from the community demonstrated by comprehensive&#13;
sharing in the process and costs of the design and implementation of the project;&#13;
-     that the project would be sustainable under community management and that adequate&#13;
arrangements have been made to this effect; and&#13;
-     that the cost per beneficiary did not exceed the maximum agreed under the project.&#13;
Implementation would be by contracts made according to procurement rules that would give preference&#13;
to community associations and local contractors, whether for construction or for the provision of&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
20.   In view of the expected start-up of interventions of the Social Fund for Development (SFD)&#13;
(IDA Cr. 2953-YE) in the project area shortly after that of the proposed project, close coordination&#13;
would be established and maintained with that project's field staff as soon as they are appointed. During&#13;
appraisal, agreement was reached with SFD management on the cooperation mechanism for subprojects&#13;
which would be more suitable for SFD funding. The project would act as intermediary between&#13;
communities and the SFD for investments either in communities that are not eligible for the project's&#13;
own Fund, or for additional investments in other communities. In this case, project staff would assist the&#13;
communities in preparing a project to the standards required by the SFD and support the community up&#13;
to the point when the SFD accepted the project and integrated it into its own program. In addition,&#13;
agreement was reached during appraisal on cooperation on methodology, training and programming with&#13;
a GTZ-financed community development project that is working in other parts of the southern&#13;
governorates.&#13;
Future Projects Preparation (Base Cost US $ 1.0 million)&#13;
21.   The pipeline of projects in agriculture and rural development is very weak. Despite the&#13;
processing needs of the sector, particularly in rehabilitating rural services, no projects are ready.&#13;
Therefore, an allocation has been made under the present project, totaling $ 1.0 million, to finance&#13;
consultants, working groups and a pilot project.&#13;
Project Management Unit (Base Cost US$2.7 million)&#13;
22.   A Project Management Unit would be set up to implement the project (Chapter III). Investments&#13;
to be financed are: technical assistance and project staff, vehicles, office equipment, office rental, and&#13;
operating costs.&#13;

SOUTUERN GOVERNORATES RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Abstract: The project objective is poverty alleviation for a specific target group in the&#13;
poor southern governorates of Yemen. Components are land development, off farm&#13;
income development and community development The land development component&#13;
and two of the off-farm income generating activities have been subjected to cost&#13;
benefit analysis. EIRRs are in the range 9-17 percent for new land development; and&#13;
in the range 22-28 percent for rehabilitation. The livestock income generating activity&#13;
EIRR is 20 percent, andfor fisheries the ERR is over 175 percent Cost effectiveness&#13;
evaluation has been carried out for other components.&#13;
A. Policy Environment&#13;
1.    The economic situation in Yemen has been difficult for almost a decade, following the&#13;
successive shocks of the Gulf War, Unification and the 1994 Civil War. This has had its impact&#13;
on incomes and social condition, and has led to a weakening of Government services. However,&#13;
Government embarked on a program of stabilization and adjustment from 1995, and has adopted&#13;
a growth and poverty alleviation strategy based on a reduced role for the public sector, the&#13;
development of the private sector, and direct interventions to reduce poverty.  Thus,&#13;
government's program currently focuses on: (i) stabilization to restore macroeconomic balance&#13;
and reduce inflation; (ii) structural reform and adjustment to stimulate economic growth; and&#13;
(iii) poverty alleviation and social protection measures. The structural reforms are being&#13;
supported by the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC, Credit No. 2840-YEM) approved in April&#13;
1996. Poverty alleviation is to be achieved through different initiatives, including a rapid&#13;
income transfer through the Public Works Project (Credit No. 2878-YE), by the Social Fund&#13;
Project (Credit No. 2953-YE), and by the proposed project.&#13;
2.    Performance to date has been good. The stabilization program is on track, and the&#13;
adjustment program is being supported by IDA adjustment lending (Economic Recovery Credit,&#13;
Credit No. 2840-YEM). Public sector reform is to be supported by an Administrative Reform&#13;
Credit (FY99). Yemen's proposed decentralization law, which has been approved by the Cabinet&#13;
and is now in Parliament, will further facilitate implementation of the types of activities&#13;
supported by the proposed project. A financial sector adjustment program has begun and this is&#13;
to be supported under the recently appraised Financial Sector Adjustment Credit.&#13;

3.    The latest formal sector work in agriculture was the Agricultural Sector Study&#13;
(September 1993, Report 11126-YEM). This report, although somewhat dated by the rapid&#13;
decline of the effectiveness of public services, nonetheless sets the strategic context for the&#13;
proposed project: it emphasizes the need for attention to poor rural areas, with bottom up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex a&#13;
Page 2 of 20&#13;
planning focused on farmers needs and measures to ensure community participation in project&#13;
preparation and execution. It underlines the need for prudent attention to water resources&#13;
exploitation and management, and recommends interventions that give priority to poverty&#13;
alleviation and to improving the lot of women. The proposed project has been designed within&#13;
this framework.&#13;
4.    More recent sector work has been done in water sector with the Water Strategy (August&#13;
1997, Report No. 15718-YEM). This report promotes a broad agenda of water conservation,&#13;
with emphasis on the need for good information and a regional planning context for all new&#13;
water resources development, and on the need for water users to be mobilized in self-&#13;
management and self-regulation. The proposed project has been agreed with the new National&#13;
Water Resources Authority as falling within the planning framework; the project provides&#13;
support to water resources monitoring; and the development of water user associations is integral&#13;
to project implementation and management.&#13;
5.    Recent sector work on poverty is contained in the Poverty Assessment (June 1996,&#13;
Report No. 15158-YEM). The Assessment recommends an approach that targets the poor&#13;
directly, with particular emphasis on the non-governmental sector and local community groups.&#13;
IDA is supporting a nationwide program on these lines through the Public Works Project (Credit&#13;
No. 2878-YE) and the Social Fund Project (Credit No. 2953-YE). The proposed project is set in&#13;
the context of this special emphasis on action in the rural sector through a community approach&#13;
and through investment in sustainable increases in incomes.&#13;
6.    The recent Public Expenditure Review highlights the need to prioritize public&#13;
investment spending on high return activities, and to minimize the recurrent cost burden on&#13;
Government from projects. The proposed project's focus on a particular, highly impoverished&#13;
target group has been based on this prioritization imperative, and the project has been designed&#13;
so that at completion there will be a zero recurrent cost burden on Government, as the project&#13;
unit will be dissolved, and the beneficiaries and users will have taken full control of assets and&#13;
their management.&#13;
C.    Links to CAS&#13;
7.    The project is fully consistent with the latest country assistance strategy (CAS, January&#13;
1996, Report No. 15286-YEM). The CAS has three main objectives:&#13;
(a)    Stabilization, Structural Reforms and Social Protection.  The principal&#13;
thrusts are to support the stabilization and structural adjustment program by&#13;
policy dialogue and adjustment lending and to attack poverty in a practical way&#13;
through targeted interventions and support to economic growth. The proposed&#13;
project is designed to provide support to the poorest segment of the community&#13;
in a well-defined geographical area where targeting is possible and where there&#13;
are good prospects for a sustainable solution to poverty through economic&#13;
development. It is thus a prime means of implementing this CAS objective (see&#13;
CAS para. 46).&#13;
(b)    Portfolio  Implementation  and  Sustainability  of Investments. Poor&#13;
implementation performance and a mixed record on sustainability of&#13;
investments underlie this important objective. The principal tools proposed are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 20&#13;
selectivity of new investments (confined to situations where there are good&#13;
prospects of efficient implementation) and an emphasis on cost-effective and&#13;
innovative approaches to project management. The proposed project has been&#13;
designed in the light of the mixed record of rural development projects in&#13;
implementation and sustainability; the project should contribute to the CAS&#13;
objective of improving implementation and sustainability by incorporating a&#13;
radical change in project management approach and by integrating beneficiary&#13;
and community involvement and capacity building as the main foundation of&#13;
sustainability (see CAS para. 47).&#13;
(c)    Sustainable Natural Resource Development. The proposed project is founded&#13;
on detailed work on the nature and extent of the natural resource base.&#13;
Sustainable water management (see CAS para. 51) is built into the project&#13;
through: (i) the establishment of water user associations; (ii) the buildup of&#13;
monitoring capability; (iii) site selection; and (iv) sufficient technical assistance.&#13;
This project was incorporated into the CAS after discussion by the Board in February 1996. The&#13;
project is shown as a complement to the structural adjustment program and will provide an&#13;
alternative mechanism to the Government for helping the poor to re-enter the economy.&#13;
D. Role of the Private Sector and Rationale for Public Sector Intervention&#13;
8.    Role of the Private Sector. Government has primary responsibility for financing and&#13;
implementing the project. However, the role of the private sector will be key, as implementation&#13;
will be through a program of public-private partnerships using community groups and private&#13;
contractors. The project will work through private contractors to deliver most activities, which&#13;
will be defined, executed and monitored by beneficiaries and community groups. Beneficiary&#13;
cost sharing is a significant feature of the project (US$5.4 million, 11 percent of project cost).&#13;
9.    Rationale for Public Sector Involvement. In general, public intervention is justified&#13;
because the project: (i) target benefits to poor communities unlikely to be reached by the private&#13;
sector; and (ii) provides an impetus for new approaches to poverty reduction which could be&#13;
generalized once sufficient experience and familiarity with them has been gained.&#13;
10.   Each component was examined to determine the maximum possible scope for private&#13;
participation or implementation. The results are presented in Table 1 below. The role of the&#13;
private sector has been maximized, and for most components there is cost sharing and&#13;
beneficiary participation in management and implementation. Some functions have been&#13;
necessarily allocated to Government for the reasons indicated in the table. The principal criteria&#13;
which have been applied to determine the roles of public and private sectors are:&#13;
(a)   redistribution - the market will not redistribute assets to the poor, and&#13;
Government has necessarily to assume the task in the interests of equity. As the&#13;
project's principal objective is poverty alleviation, this is the dominant reason&#13;
for public intervention and applies to all components.&#13;
(b)   incomplete information - the market will not invest in assets or activities where&#13;
there is inadequate information about likely outcomes. For example, the land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 20&#13;
development component is based on detailed information available only to&#13;
Government on the water resources and their future allocation and management.&#13;
(c)    reserved function - some activities are essentially Government's task. In the&#13;
project, the allocation of public land and registration of title can only be&#13;
performed by a Government agency (although implementation can - and will be&#13;
- be delegated to the private sector).&#13;
(d)    exclusion difficult - in the case of public infrastructure such as roads that may&#13;
be constructed under the community development component, it would be&#13;
difficult to prevent a third party, non-member of the community from using the&#13;
asset .&#13;

E. The Project Management Approach&#13;
11.    Throughout the preparation period, there was a pronounced and pervasive skepticism&#13;
evident about the capability of a project to affect the problem of rural poverty. Rural people -&#13;
and government officials - tended to see a project as a series of inputs with Government agencies&#13;
as the beneficiary rather than a coherent set of deliverables designed to impact on the real&#13;
problem. This perception, which is largely based on past experience, led to the proposals for&#13;
project implementation, which provide for a temporary, light and efficient structure focused&#13;
entirely on the impact on the target group. Project management arrangements will follow private&#13;
sector practice and accountability, adopting a "business approach". Under this approach, the&#13;
Government has created by Decree of December 1996 the Project Management Unit (PMU) as a&#13;
temporary autonomous legal entity with powers and a structure equivalent to those of a private&#13;
business. The reason for this business approach is to ensure that the project starts up rapidly and&#13;
is implemented at lowest possible cost with the maximum direct benefits being delivered in a&#13;
timely and efficient manner to the beneficiaries - the rural poor.&#13;
12.    The PMU will exist to achieve specific targets over the project period, and would be&#13;
dissolved at the end of the project. Low management overhead would be a key performance&#13;
indicator, not exceeding 10 percent of project cost (compared to rates of 20 percent and upward&#13;
experienced in projects in the sector that have been implemented through ministries). A key&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 5 of 20&#13;
parameter retained is that "overhead" (the cost of project management) should be at most $1 for&#13;
every $9 value of output delivered to the beneficiary. Beneficiary involvement in monitoring&#13;
this and other parameters will provide one of the checks on the effectiveness of the "business&#13;
approach".&#13;
13.   The cost-effectiveness of the proposed approach was tested against the alternative of&#13;
delivering the services through govemment ministries.  The Government units primarily&#13;
responsible for development projects were examined and the average cost of overhead per dollar&#13;
of investment in these ministries was estimated and compared to the forecast average for the&#13;
project. This cost-effectiveness comparison shows that the proposed project is more efficient&#13;
and would result in an overhead cost savings of about 60 percent compared to the estimated cost&#13;
of conducting these activities in the Ministries. This comparison excludes the question of&#13;
whether Government ministries are capable of implementing this type of community and&#13;
beneficiary based project.&#13;
F. Cost Benefit Analysis&#13;
14.   Cost-Benefit Analysis Methodology. For those components where a cost benefit&#13;
technique is used to calculate the economic internal rate of return (i.e., Land Development,&#13;
Livestock and Fisheries), the financial and economic rates of return for each project component&#13;
have been calculated by the following methodology.  First, a financial flows model is&#13;
constructed for the with project scenario. Next the without project scenario is modeled. The&#13;
difference between the with and without project is calculated, and the financial net present value&#13;
and internal rate of return estimated on the net benefit flow. The model is then adjusted for&#13;
specific conversion factors and the economic net present value and internal rate of return&#13;
determined.  This methodology is followed for each region in the Land Development&#13;
Component, resulting in six separate estimates of the economic returns. The period of the&#13;
analysis is 20 years for the Land Development component. For the Livestock and Fisheries&#13;
components, the period of analysis is only ten years. This period was chosen because the&#13;
components return very robust economic rates of return and a longer analysis period was not&#13;
considered to be warranted.&#13;
15.   Opportunity Cost of Capital. Based on IDA norms for projects in Yemen, the analysis&#13;
has been carried out using a 10 percent discount rate. Use of the 10 percent discount rate will&#13;
also be required for future revenue-earning services and micro-enterprises identified under the&#13;
off-farm income development component.&#13;
16.   Macroeconomic Risk. The following are the main specific macroeconomic assumptions&#13;
that would condition success (see project design summary in Annex 1): continued macroeconomic&#13;
stabilisation; and continued Government support for a decentralised rural poverty alleviation&#13;
program as a major development goal. Indications are that these assumptions are realistic and do&#13;
not present a high risk. The macroeconomic stabilization program is on track and Government is&#13;
negotiating a new facility with the IME and a new adjustment operation with IDA. Nonetheless,&#13;
the macroeconomic context is vital. The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of just one&#13;
macroeconomic parameter going off track (Scenario # I models the impact of a divergence between&#13;
official and market exchange rates). Although this risk presently appears unlikely to materialise,&#13;
the results of the sensitivity analysis underscore the need for careful monitoring and for sustained&#13;
dialogue at the macroeconomic level in order to provide an enabling environment for the project to&#13;
succeed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 6 of 20&#13;
17.   Regarding Govemment support for decentralized rural poverty operations, Government&#13;
has worked actively with NGOs and donors on poverty alleviation and has made a commitment&#13;
to major operations for poverty alleviation. There is a strong historic tradition of decentralized&#13;
self-management and community involvement in the development process, and this is reinforced&#13;
not only by Government's present policy and practice but also by a strong self-help movement&#13;
from communities themselves. Donors at the recent Consultative Group meeting showed strong&#13;
support for this approach, and are backing it up with several externally-financed initiatives in the&#13;
way of decentralized and community led development. The risk that this approach will not be&#13;
sustained are therefore small.&#13;
18.   Institutional Risk. Experience with IDA projects in the rural sector has been mixed, with&#13;
problems of both implementation and sustainability. The implementation strategy for the proposed&#13;
project goes a long way to reduce this risk - relying upon a demand-driven, field-oriented way of&#13;
working; a "business approach" to management with properly paid and qualified staff;&#13;
decentralization in implementation; transparency and accountability; and autonomy from over-&#13;
bureaucratic procedures. However, the implementation design involves innovative experiments&#13;
and would require political commitment and good management to make it work. Government has&#13;
endorsed the proposed approach and has acted decisively to create the steering committee and the&#13;
PMU, and to appoint the project director. At the local level, the governors for the project areas are&#13;
committed to quick results on the ground. The early appointment of the project director will help to&#13;
get early results, so that the project could generate its own momentum of support.&#13;
Land Development Component&#13;
19.   Description. The land development component comprises a series of activities designed&#13;
to establish about 1,950 very poor landless families within the target communities in sustainable&#13;
new farming operations on about 3,900 ha. About 3,150 ha would be newly developed and about&#13;
750 ha would be rehabilitation work on former state farms. Sub-components would be: (i) land&#13;
allocation - assignment of secure title for lands to be developed or rehabilitated under the project&#13;
to poor rural families, largely dispossessed; (ii) land development and rehabilitation - about&#13;
3,900 hectares of irrigated land would be developed or rehabilitated, and water monitoring set up&#13;
or reinforced; and (iii) farmer services - training and extension (delivered by professionals on a&#13;
contract basis), help to access credit for equipment and inputs, and material support to farm&#13;
establishment. The project sites are located in three separate governorates. The farm units of 2&#13;
ha would generate incomes of between $2,600 and $4,000 per farm family, varying according to&#13;
the crop mix (2 ha has been set as the size that can be managed by a family and that provides a&#13;
good income). Complete details are available in the Project File.&#13;
20.   Up-Front Screening. The project land sites were selected during identification and&#13;
preparation from a large number of sites proposed by Government. Selection criteria were&#13;
technical (soils, water quality, quantity and sustainability, production capability), social (target&#13;
population in the area, community willing), legal (no claims on the land, Government held&#13;
secure title), and economic (lower per hectare development cost, likely ERR above 10 percent).&#13;
After this screening, sites were studied in detail and the technical, social, legal and economic&#13;
analyses were finalized at preparation and reviewed at appraisal.&#13;
21.   Benefits. For the Base Case scenario, benefit streams are based on detailed farm&#13;
budgets that conservatively estimate yields and prices for the area (e.g. onions 15-18 t/ha,&#13;
tomatoes 10-15 t/ha, sesame 0.6-1.2 tlha). Cropping intensities are between 95-111 percent,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 7 of 20&#13;
which are below best practice in the area. Full crop development is assumed five years after the&#13;
start of farning on each site. The predominant crops in the analysis are wheat, durah, dates,&#13;
onions tomatoes and other vegetables.&#13;
22.   Costs. Project costs come from the detailed crop budgets and IDA's estimates of capital&#13;
expenditures and technical assistance. The Land Development component costs include land&#13;
allocation, development or rehabilitation (well drilling and equipment, water conveyance&#13;
systems, land leveling, field layout), and the costs of crop development for the start-up period&#13;
(training, extension, support to farm establishment, including leaching, deep ploughing, in field&#13;
canal construction, tree planting, soil amendment). Recurrent include pump replacement after&#13;
every seven years of service and ongoing O&amp;M for the entire period. Water has been priced&#13;
using the pumping cost as a proxy, as there is no resource charge and there is no alternative use&#13;
of the water that would allow an opportunity cost to be calculated. Depletion costs and recharge&#13;
benefits are not included in the analysis as it is envisaged that the project will not result in&#13;
mining of the aquifer (and provisions for water monitoring and management are included in the&#13;
project to ensure this outcome).&#13;
23.   Without Project Scenario. The without project scenario assumes that the project's&#13;
beneficiaries are living at, or near, the poverty line. Base Case assumptions are a per capita&#13;
annual expenditure of YR 5723, a figure based on Annex II.A of the green cover Poverty&#13;
Assessment (Report No. 151 58-YEM) for the Hadramawt governorate, increased by 2.53 percent&#13;
for the rate of inflation since the report's publication. The without project scenario assumes an&#13;
average family size of 6.5 persons, and that the working members of the household are employed&#13;
in various, but unknown, activities resulting in an average poverty line income on a per capita&#13;
basis.&#13;
24.   Conversion Factors. Conversion factors were calculated and used for the foreign&#13;
exchange premium on all tradable inputs, diesel or gasoline (as appropriate) used in pumps or&#13;
vehicles, farmgate wheat prices, urea, phosphate and land. Imported IDA project capital inputs&#13;
are not subject to customs duties or local taxes, therefore no adjustment was made for these&#13;
taxes. See the Project File for details.&#13;
25.   Economic Return. The base case analysis, using the assumptions described above,&#13;
shows economic rates of return to the land development component of between 9 percent and 17&#13;
percent for new land development; and between 22 percent and 28 percent for rehabilitation.&#13;
The lowest rate of return (9 percent) applies to the two new development schemes in Abyan&#13;
Governorate. This rate of return reflects the relatively difficult soil and water conditions in the&#13;
Governorate. The two sites have been retained in the project because of the extreme problem of&#13;
poverty in the area and the lack of alternative economic activities that could be developed.&#13;
Nonetheless, the development at one site (Khabt Al-Asloom) will be phased in order to assess&#13;
the water resources situation, and a decision will be taken on whether to develop the whole of the&#13;
scheme at the time of the Mid-Term Review.&#13;

26.    Risks-Project Complexity. One of the lessons from IDA lending experience has been&#13;
that project design should be as simple as possible. The sensitivity analysis shows the possible&#13;
impact of project complexity leading to delays and cost increases (Scenario # 2 in the Sensitivity&#13;
Analysis), and project design therefore focused on maintaining as simple a design as is consistent&#13;
with achieving project objectives and on ensuring workable management arrangements. During&#13;
preappraisal and appraisal, components of the proposed project were reduced (the fisheries&#13;
component) or eliminated (the proposed traditional building component) and the resulting project&#13;
has, in fact, a simple structure and a manageable implementation strategy. The key features are:&#13;
community dialogue and involvement as the unifying mechanism for project activities; the business&#13;
approach to project management; and implementation through contractors under supervision rather&#13;
than by a heavy in-house capacity. Although the project is spread geographically across five&#13;
separated regions, this is nonetheless a viable project area as the project intervenes in a finite&#13;
number of communities (40) and staff are mandated to be highly mobile and to use all means of&#13;
communication (including the recently reintroduced cellular telephones, together with fax, radio&#13;
etc.). The project is thus manageable, provided the PMU is endowed with the powers and attributes&#13;
intended. This underlines the importance attached in project design to the characteristics of the&#13;
PMU and the need for close follow up during start up and supervision.&#13;
27.    Risks-Water Resources.  Water scarcity is a major constraint in Yemen, and the&#13;
economic consequences on the project if water were to be insufficient or if pumping costs were to&#13;
increase are very striking (see Scenarios # 3 and 4 in the Sensitivity Analysis). Therefore, close&#13;
attention was paid to the issue throughout the preparation and appraisal process. Availability of&#13;
sustainable water has been a prime factor in determining the sites which have been adopted for land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 9 of 20&#13;
development. During identification and preparation, site investigations were carried out and the&#13;
large number of existing studies of water resources and data collected by public agencies were&#13;
analyzed, including the nationwide Water Resources Assessment of Yemen (General Departrnent&#13;
of Hydrogeology, with Netherlands Government aid), the survey of Wadi Hadramawt resources&#13;
(Murdoch McDonald, IDA-financed) and numerous local and regional surveys. As a result, Lahej&#13;
governorate was excluded from land development activities and only limited areas were selected in&#13;
Abyan and Shabwa. Further work was done at appraisal, when the mission included a&#13;
hydrogeologist. Subsequent work published on Hadramawt from a Canadian consultant study&#13;
(KOMEX) confirms the adequacy of sustainable water in that area. Based on these existing studies,&#13;
new field work and expert opinion, sites have only been included where extraction of water is&#13;
sustainable. Proposed development of water resources under the project has been discussed with&#13;
the National Water Resources Authority (NWRA), which is responsible for approving water&#13;
resource uses. In addition, support is being provided under this and other projects for water&#13;
monitoring and management. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government&#13;
(through NWRA) would: (i) prepare a plan to control groundwater development in the project areas&#13;
and limit abstraction of each aquifer to those recommended by the available hydrological studies&#13;
and submit it to IDA by December 31, 1998 and (ii) submit to IDA by January 31 of each year a&#13;
annual report on groundwater monitoring and assessment for each of the project areas. Other&#13;
measures are discussed below in the section on environment.&#13;
28.   Risks-Land Tenure. In the fluid conditions that prevailed in the southem govemorates&#13;
after unification and the civil war of 1994, there were many land claims. Notwithstanding the&#13;
multiple precautions taken during project preparation to deal with claims, and to drop sites where&#13;
title was seriously contested, under the Constitution of Yemen, citizens are always entitled to&#13;
lodge claims, however speculative. The sensitivity analysis carried out on the project rate of&#13;
return shows that if problems over land tenure were to reduce the number of farms in service&#13;
(Scenarios #5 in the Sensitivity Analysis), project viability would be at risk. However, this risk&#13;
has been minimized by the actions of Government in clearing claims and asserting and assigning&#13;
freehold title, and also by the community validation procedure followed to select beneficiaries.&#13;
This process has gone as far as possible to reduce the risk that further claims are made on the&#13;
lands once allocated, as there is both a formal declaration and assignment of a clean title&#13;
underwritten by govermment and a community commitment to the agreed distribution. Two&#13;
further steps have been built in to ensure that no claims could be made on land once developed.&#13;
First, the sites would be demarcated, further announcements made in the newspapers, and any&#13;
resulting claims would be adjudicated before the tender for development is launched. Second,&#13;
Govemment would grant freehold title on plots to beneficiaries before land is developed.&#13;
29.   Risks-Farm Productivity. As beneficiaries receiving land are poor, they may be risk&#13;
averse and also have problems of access to investment and working capital. In addition, there is&#13;
a risk that markets may not be steady or able to absorb output, particularly high value produce.&#13;
These risks could threaten the economic justification of the project (as shown by Scenario # 6 in&#13;
the Sensitivity Analysis). These risks would be avoided by the emphasis placed on support to&#13;
farmers in the early years of farming to provide training, access to inputs and credit. The high&#13;
grade contract extension services would help farmers to prepare professional business plans&#13;
matching produce to markets, and would ease farner access to bank financing. This risk also&#13;
reinforced the case for farmers to share in the costs, in order to ensure that they have the&#13;
incentive to earn the maximum possible return from their farming. Finally, the allocation of land&#13;
to beneficiaries on a freehold basis would both increase farmer incentives and ease access to&#13;
credit.&#13;

30.    Sensitivity Analysis. The sensitivities modeled correspond to the risks discussed above.&#13;
The analysis has been carried out only on the land development component as: (i) this is the&#13;
largest component subject to cost benefit analysis; (ii) the risks impact predominantly on this&#13;
component; and (iii) some of the Base Case EIRRs for this component are close to or at the cut&#13;
off point. The risks modeled are:&#13;

#1        Divergence of 5% p.a. between official and market exchange rates  negative - 17%&#13;
(macroeconomic risk)&#13;
#2        Civil works costs increase by 30% (project complexity)        4 - 24%&#13;
# 3       Crop benefits decrease by 25% (water resources risk)           negative - 18%&#13;
# 4       Pumping costs increase by 50% (water resources risk)           2 -21%&#13;
# 5       Feddans grown decreased by 20% (land tenure risk)              5 - 23%&#13;
# 6       Cropping intensity reaches 1.0 only after five years (farm     9-28%&#13;
productivity risk)&#13;
The results of the sensitivity analysis show that for all but one of the risks modeled, some of the&#13;
land development component EIRRs would drop below 10 percent. This underlines the&#13;
importance of: (i) the mitigating and risk-avoiding measures that have been built into the project&#13;
and which are discussed above; and (ii) the need for close monitoring of all parameters&#13;
throughout implementation (see Section K below for details).&#13;
31.    Switching values were also calculated for the two areas showing the lowest predicted&#13;
economic returns (Hadramawt and Abyan). The results, illustrated in Table 4 below, amplify the&#13;
discussion of the previous paragraph and those of the ICRs of previous IDA experience&#13;
examined for this project-achieving the predicted crop intensities and benefit streams will be a&#13;
key ingredient to achieving the project's development objectives. Thus, these two parameters&#13;
will be closely monitored during supervision (see full discussion at Section K).&#13;

32.    Transfer Payments. For each of the Land Development sub-components, a distribution&#13;
of the net present value of the economic benefits and costs was made between the beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 1 1 of 20&#13;
(farmers) and the government. The results are shown in Table 10 at the end of this annex. As&#13;
illustrated, the overall economic benefit of this component is just over YR 1.0 billion. The&#13;
amount accruing to the farmers exceeds this amount by some YR 737 million, reflecting the net&#13;
balance of input subsidies and below-market wheat farm gate prices. From this analysis, we&#13;
confirm that the intended beneficiaries well targeted.&#13;
Off-Farm Income Development Component&#13;
33.   The component would comprise three sets of activities to provide assistance to poor&#13;
people to set up or develop very small or small businesses or to acquire the technical skills&#13;
training needed to find remunerative employment. The interest of the target group to take up&#13;
these opportunities has been established through the participatory preparation process. The&#13;
component would comprise three sets of activities: (i) livestock development - training and&#13;
equipment in animal health and care to about 500 poor villagers, at least half of them women, to&#13;
enable them to set up as simple animal health providers ("paraveterinarians") - this activity has&#13;
been successfully piloted by a GTZ-financed project in the southern governorates; (ii) fishing&#13;
development - training and equipment of about 280 new entrants to the profitable fisheries&#13;
business on the south coast; and (iii) promotion of other revenue-earning services and micro-&#13;
enterprise. This activity would provide assistance to: (i) establish start-up micro and small&#13;
enterprises' (MSEs); (ii) assist already existing MSEs; and (iii) provide technical skills training&#13;
in areas where employment opportunities exist.&#13;
34.   Livestock. For the livestock activity the benefits are expected to be substantial in&#13;
relation to the costs; appraisal estimates are that training of a paravet should create the ability to&#13;
generate an additional income of US$500-1,000/annum. However, to present a conservative&#13;
case, the benefit stream for this component is based on estimated income per paravet of only&#13;
US$750, and it has been assumed that only 50 percent of those trained will carry on this&#13;
profession. The without project model is the same as the Land Development component, i.e., that&#13;
beneficiaries are assumed to be currently employed in activities that result in a household&#13;
poverty line income on a per capita basis. The economic net present value for livestock is YR 36&#13;
million, and economic internal rate of return is expected to be 20 percent. A switching value&#13;
analysis was performed on the estimated income and number of people that carry on in the&#13;
profession. As shown in Table 5 below, the estimated annual income would have to fall below&#13;
US$ 585, or the number of people remaining in the profession would have to decrease by another&#13;
50, before the NPV reached zero.&#13;
A common definition of MSEs includes a wide range of enterprises (services, transport, agriculture,&#13;
manufacturing) ranging from part time, seasonal activities of a single person to small, formal&#13;
enterprises employing several non-family members.&#13;

be what percent?&#13;
the decrease in the number of people remaining in the  50&#13;
profession would have to be what?&#13;
35.    No analysis of transfer payments was performed because the financial and economic net&#13;
present values were equal, implying all benefits accrue to the beneficiaries.&#13;
36.    Fisheries.  For the fisheries activity costs include training, school days per diem.&#13;
apprenticeship fees, boats, motors, gear and operations and maintenance costs. The Base Case&#13;
scenario assumes that 280 fishermen trained will take up the profession and that all are full-time&#13;
fishermen by year three of the analysis. It also assumes that each boat (comprised of four&#13;
fishermen) will be able to catch 26 tons of fish/boat and that YR30,000 is the average per ton&#13;
price for their catch. These numbers are based on experience under the current IDA-financed&#13;
Fisheries IV Project and are considered by IDA fishery experts to be conservative assumptions.&#13;
The without project model is the same as that described above for the Land Development&#13;
Component and Livestock sub-component. For fisheries, the Base Case economic net present&#13;
value is YR161 million and the economic internal rate of return is expected to be about 180&#13;
percent.&#13;
37.    Table 6 illustrates that economic rates of return for this sub-component are quite robust.&#13;
Of the four sensitivity analyses perforned, the EIRR was never found to be below 40 percent.&#13;
Switching value analysis shows that an about 85 percent reduction in either the price per ton or&#13;
tons caught per year would be needed to bring the economic net present value to zero.&#13;

38.    No analysis of transfer payments was performed because the financial net present value&#13;
was with two percent of the economic net present value, thereby demonstrating that almost all of&#13;
the benefits wili go to the target population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;

39.    Promotion of other revenue earning services and microenterprise activity. This sub-&#13;
component could not be yet analyzed using the cost-benefit methodology because the specific&#13;
activities financed have yet to be identified. However, the project will require the following&#13;
parameters be observed. First, a least-cost approach has been followed in setting up project&#13;
implementation arrangements for this component. In order to avoid duplication of expensive&#13;
staff capacity building, the project will leverage its resources with those of the Social Fund for&#13;
Development (SFD, providing microfinance expertise in building sustainable microfinance&#13;
institutions) and the Small Enterprise Development Unit (SEDU, providing expertise in small&#13;
enterprise finance lending) in order to build local institutional capacity. Similarly, the project&#13;
will work with Vocational Training Centers (VTCs) to provide technical skills training to project&#13;
clients and to obtain additional leverage through the investments of IDA and GTZ in building the&#13;
capacity of these institutions. Project apprenticeships and short-term training workshops will be&#13;
done in local communities and in group situations thereby reducing costs.&#13;
40.    Second, support to small enterprise development will be subject to financial analysis and&#13;
to criteria for maximum loan size and entrepreneur contribution. Maximum loan size per&#13;
permanent small enterprise job created, as well as expected entrepreneur contributions and&#13;
maximum default by type of entrepreneurial activity are given in Table 7.&#13;

41.    Third, the microfinance pilot would use financial sustainability criteria, with a baseline&#13;
expectation of financial viability for the apex organization within three years of inception. It will&#13;
also require a simplified financial analysis (without the use of conversion factors or a without&#13;
project element) be used to screen projects, with a threshold discount rate of 10 percent required.&#13;
Community Development&#13;
42.    The project will support a variety of subprojects, ranging from community development&#13;
to institutional development to small enterprise development. The approach to economic&#13;
analysis differs from subproject to subproject. It is difficult to calculate an ERR for the overall&#13;
project, given the difficulty of quantifying benefits of some of the activities supported. As far as&#13;
possible, the project approach has been aligned with that of the Social Fund (SFD) in order to&#13;
ensure compatible interventions. The approach for community development subprojects will use&#13;
an ERR approach with cut-off of 10 percent for economically productive projects. For&#13;
infrastructure projects, the project will employ a maximum unit cost per beneficiary criterion.&#13;
Subprojects with costs exceeding this maximum unit cost will not be financed. Table 8 shows&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the maximum unit cost per beneficiary for various types of community development activity. It&#13;
also shows the expected labor content for civil works and the expected level of community&#13;
contribution. These expectations will be reviewed annually to incorporate experience gained in&#13;
field operations.&#13;

G.    Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery&#13;
43.    Fiscal Impact. Over the six year implementation period, Government will have to&#13;
provide about US$ 3.4 million in counterpart funds, an average of US$600,000 per year. This&#13;
level is about 2 percent of the total capital budget for the agriculture sector, and a fraction of 1&#13;
percent of the total investment budget of the nation. It will not pose any overall fiscal problem.&#13;
There will be no recurrent cost funding required from the government under the project, and at&#13;
the end of the project the project unit will be dissolved.&#13;
44.    Cost Recovery. Beneficiaries would contribute about US$4.1 million (about 11 percent&#13;
of project costs) to cover half the cost of irrigated farn establishment, pumps and engines for&#13;
irrigation. The quantum to be recovered has been set at the level that is affordable by the&#13;
averagely performing farmer on the lowest yielding project land site (the worst case scenario).&#13;
During the work of the Committee for the Selection of Beneficiaries, the cost recovery provision&#13;
proved a practical means of identifying able and suitable candidates, as only those with the&#13;
necessary management skills were prepared to accept land on these terms. Capital repayments&#13;
will be made over fifteen years with three years grace from start of the farming operation. The&#13;
funds will be paid to community associations for use in community development activities.&#13;
45.    Repayment obligations were designed not to exceed 15 percent, on average, of farm&#13;
household incomes. This amount was considered by the project team, local advisers and farmers&#13;
to be affordable and sustainable over the fifteen-year repayment period. The project's&#13;
Procedures Manual also provides guidelines if a farm family has trouble making its payments,&#13;
including the provision for counseling and the setting up of extended payment plans and/or&#13;
limited duration grace periods after year three.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 15 of 20&#13;
H.    Design Alternatives Considered&#13;
46.   The project design was the result of an extended period of consultation with all&#13;
stakeholders, beginning with the initial Participatory Needs Assessment and continuing&#13;
throughout the preparation and appraisal period. During this process a number of alternative&#13;
design elements were considered, and not retained. The principal amongst them are:&#13;
(a)   relocation of the dispossessed - because of the constrained resource situation in&#13;
the areas in which project beneficiaries live, the possibility of relocation was&#13;
considered early in the project design phase. However, this was not retained,&#13;
first and foremost because there is a very high cost attached to resettlement,&#13;
requiring complete infrastructure in addition to investment in economic&#13;
activities before the population can be brought back to their original income&#13;
level. Best practice shows that under almost all circumstances in situ poverty&#13;
alleviation is lower cost.  If resettlement had been adopted, the project&#13;
beneficiaries would have been far fewer within the available financial resources.&#13;
Second, throughout the preparation process, and especially during the&#13;
Participatory Needs Assessment, Government and beneficiaries alike clearly&#13;
expressed a preference for locally-based poverty alleviating investments rather&#13;
than out-migration. Government pointed out that economic opportunities in&#13;
towns were hardly better than in the villages of origin, and most of Yemen's&#13;
towns are suffering from rapid and uncontrolled expansion and from growing&#13;
physical constraints, notably in water supply and sanitation. Finally, in the&#13;
difficult social situation prevailing in the southern governorates before and after&#13;
the civil war, the movement of large numbers of people to new areas would have&#13;
exacerbated social tensions.&#13;
(b)    no land development - because of the comparatively high cost of land&#13;
development, the possibility of a project without land was considered. This was&#13;
rejected by Government and IDA because: (i) the target population were farmers&#13;
and knew best how to farm; (ii) the process of consulting beneficiaries threw up an&#13;
overwhelming preference for land; (iii) despite high cost, land development&#13;
offered the most assured and stable return of any component (and it had an&#13;
acceptable rate of return); and (iv) iand development was seen by both&#13;
Government and communities as an "anchor" that held together the other project&#13;
interventions.&#13;
(c)    development of private lands and their transfer to beneficiaries - because many&#13;
of the returning owners were not interested in farming, the preparation and&#13;
appraisal missions examined the possibility that the project might invest in&#13;
rehabilitation of private lands and their transfer to beneficiaries. However, this&#13;
proved impracticable as it would have involved either Government purchasing the&#13;
land from the owners - which was against public policy - or a long term mortgage-&#13;
style arrangement whereby beneficiaries would have committed themselves to&#13;
capital repayments to owners over an extended period before they received clear&#13;
title. As the term of this arrangement would have gone well beyond the life of the&#13;
IDA Credit, IDA and Government considered that the guarantees that the&#13;
landowners would honour their side of the bargain were inadequate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 16 of 20&#13;
(d)    inplementation of the off-farm  and community developnent components&#13;
through another agency - at the time of appraisal, the new Social Fund for&#13;
Development was being set up, and the mission reviewed the feasibility that&#13;
implementation of these two components could be transferred to the Social Fund&#13;
which had similar objectives and activities. However, the management of the&#13;
Social Fund decided against this option as it was itself an embryonic institution&#13;
and was unwilling to take on extensive field commitments. Instead, it was agreed&#13;
that the two projects would cooperate in fields of mutual interest, and that the&#13;
Social Fund would implement one pilot activity for the Southern Governorates&#13;
Project (microfmance pilot) as this was a field in which the Social Fund had&#13;
competence and experience.&#13;
(e)   inclusion of a "traditional building skills component" - there is a long history of&#13;
development of the "built environment" in the project area and parts of this&#13;
environment represent a precious cultural heritage. It was proposed, therefore, to&#13;
include a traditional building skills component in the project, as this was felt to be&#13;
a possible area of economic development. However, there was a high risk that&#13;
there would not be an adequate market response as the component was designed.&#13;
In particular, it was not clear what the constraints to "market" development of the&#13;
subsector were. This led to a low and insecure rate of return in the first round of&#13;
economic analysis. It was therefore decided to drop the component as a free-&#13;
standing activity. Instead, subsector analysis will be carried out under the off-farm&#13;
income development component. The bottlenecks will thus be identified to what&#13;
should, in principle, be a thriving economic sector in several parts of the project&#13;
area.&#13;
1. Beneficiary Assessment and Poverty Impact&#13;
47.    The objective of the project is to relieve rural poverty, with a particular focus on the&#13;
pockets of extreme poverty comprising those families dispossessed as a result of the 1990&#13;
changes in land tenure. The focus of project preparation right from the start was, therefore, on&#13;
identifying the target population, on defining their characteristics and needs, and on including&#13;
them as full partners in project design and implementation. This process began with the&#13;
Participatory Needs Assessment (PNA) conducted by IDA in 1994 as part of project&#13;
identification. The PNA found that income losses for the dispossessed averaged 41 percent. The&#13;
dispossessed tenants were (and are) living below the poverty line; the PNA found that the&#13;
majority of the dispossessed (86 percent) are living in absolute poverty (less than US$65, Rls&#13;
8,775 per person per year); and the balance are below the general poverty line (US$85, Rls&#13;
1 1,475 per person per year).&#13;
48.    The existence of this well-defined poverty target group makes it relatively easy to select&#13;
project beneficiaries and to know that they are poor. Records exist for all project areas as to who&#13;
are the dispossessed, and these are easy to validate through community dialogue. It is expected&#13;
that about 75 percent of project beneficiaries will come from this group. The balance will be&#13;
selected on the basis of community dialogue.&#13;
49.   In order to ensure that the project meets its objectives of poverty alleviation, a financial&#13;
analysis was carried out to evaluate the ability of the land allocation of 5 feddans to sustain the&#13;
livelihood of farm families and to bring them sustainably above the poverty lines. Cash income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 17 of 20&#13;
from a typical 5 feddan farm will ensure that the target group is lifted out of poverty - farm&#13;
incomes per person are of the order of US$ 400, well above the poverty line of US$ 85.&#13;
Similarly, the expected cash incomes from the livestock component (US$250 per person) and&#13;
from the fisheries component (up to US$ 450 per person) are well above the poverty line&#13;

J.     Environmental Aspects&#13;
50.   The project carries a number of moderate environmental risks, especially with respect to&#13;
water management, sustainable land use, and sustainable farming practices.&#13;
Water Management&#13;
51.   The availability of groundwater is a major constraint in Yemen and groundwater&#13;
availability has been a major factor in designing the land development component. In addition to&#13;
the safeguards discussed above, project development would be phased at one site (Khabt al&#13;
Asloom), in order to assess the water situation before completing the scheme. No groundwater&#13;
development would take place in coastal Hadramawt or in Lahej where water resources are&#13;
limited and mainly fulfilling urban demand. In addition, in order to assess water use and flow,&#13;
and to encourage farmers in sustainable water use, the project would require and finance water&#13;
meters on the wells drilled under the project.&#13;
52.   The drilling of deeper wells brings a risk of contamination of lower aquifers through&#13;
leakage from surface water or the higher aquifer. The risk would be mitigated through careful&#13;
site selection and through requiring the sealing off the upper aquifers by concrete/grout casing&#13;
through the upper aquifers and stainless steel casing. Well design would be approved by IDA,&#13;
and execution of well drilling, casing and welding would be carried out by licensed drilling&#13;
companies and carefully supervised by project staff, govemment (including local water&#13;
monitoring units) and international consultants.&#13;
Sustainable Land Use&#13;
53.   The major environmental risks of farming at the southern govemorates are salination of&#13;
farm land and wind erosion. In many areas, the salt levels in well water are moderate to critical&#13;
and do not allow leaching. Sites where serious risks of salination cannot be mitigated, have&#13;
therefore been excluded from the project. In general, the risk would be managed through training&#13;
of farmers in irrigation management and in leaching practices. Wind erosion would be reduced&#13;
through careful monitoring of new constructions in irrigated fields and through planting wind-&#13;
breaks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Sustainable Farming Practices&#13;
54.   High productivity farming in the arid conditions of the southern governorates requires&#13;
careful on-farm husbandry, particularly soil and water management. The risk of sub-optimal&#13;
farming practices would be mitigated by training, both through extension and on-site training for&#13;
farmer groups. The project would not finance pesticides and would encourage the use of&#13;
integrated pest management techniques. Efforts to enhance animal health and care would&#13;
increase efficiency of production and decrease non-productive use of grazing and water&#13;
resources.&#13;
Biodiversity&#13;
55.   The project would have a minimal effect on biodiversity. The emphasis on traditional&#13;
practices in field school- and paravet training, as well as on bee-keeping as an off-farm activity,&#13;
would increase appreciation for plant and animal biodiversity, and would enhance the respect for&#13;
traditional knowledge systems.&#13;
56.   The fisheries component would not affect the threatened coastal lobster population.&#13;
Increased coastal fishing, by providing and equipping a limited number of boats, is not expected&#13;
to have a measurable impact on the small (sardine, mackerel) and large pelagic (tuna, sharks,&#13;
etc.) fish population.&#13;
Archeological Sites&#13;
57.   The project is not expected to provide a risk to archeological sites. One proposed&#13;
irrigation site was in fact eliminated as it threatened an archaeological site, and others were&#13;
dropped to avoid affecting the water table in the cities in the region. Water use near or upstream&#13;
of these sites would be monitored through the water meters installed on newly drilled wells. It is&#13;
expected that there may be some positive impact on the Naqb al Hajr historic site, by better land&#13;
management adjacent to the site.&#13;
K. Monitoring, Supervision and Evaluation&#13;
Monitoring of Risks&#13;
58.   Risks have been thoroughly analyzed and minimizing, avoiding and mitigating measures&#13;
have been deployed. Monitoring of all critical assumptions and risks would be continuous&#13;
throughout the project period (through project monitoring and evaluation, supervision missions,&#13;
mid-term review, independent evaluation). In the event that these or other risks nonetheless&#13;
threaten implementation, and the government would not implement agreed upon solutions, then&#13;
remedies would be employed, going from restructuring to cancellation.&#13;
Monitoring of Implementation and Impact&#13;
59.   Monitoring of project implementation and impact would be continuous throughout the&#13;
project. The basis would be the key performance indicators developed in the design summary&#13;
(Annex 1), which were agreed at negotiations. The detailed monitoring framework would be&#13;
designed and supervised by the monitoring and evaluation specialist. The finance manager and&#13;
the M&amp;E specialist would be jointly responsible for the Management Information System (MIS).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 19 of 20&#13;
Monitoring by the beneficiary target groups of project execution and impact would be built in&#13;
from the start, involving at least one formal meeting a year in each community.&#13;
60.   In order to track the impact of the project on incomes and welfare at the household level,&#13;
a limited number of families would be monitored regularly throughout the project by the M&amp;E&#13;
system set up by the project's M&amp;E Specialist.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
61.   A project launch workshop would be held shortly before the expected date of&#13;
effectiveness.  This would provide "just in time" training in procurement, disbursement,&#13;
accounting, auditing and management procedures. Thereafter, regular IDA supervision would&#13;
take place every six months, according to a supervision plan that was worked out at appraisal&#13;
(see Annex 10). Supervision would be led from the Yemen Resident Mission, with support from&#13;
headquarters. This will allow close and frequent follow-up, particularly in the initial stages of&#13;
the project. Supervision resources required are estimated at 25 weeks in FY98, and thereafter 18&#13;
weeks annually, with a special provision of additional resources in FY 2001 to conduct the&#13;
proposed mid-term review. At least once a year, supervision missions would contain a financial&#13;
analyst to verify procedures and give some hands-on training. At least once a year supervision&#13;
missions would contain an economist to follow up on the macroeconomic parameters and to&#13;
measure to what extent project implementation and costs and benefits were in line with forecasts.&#13;
Mid-Term Review&#13;
62.   In view of its novel implementation methodology and to allow for redesign and&#13;
adjustment of project inputs and components, a mid-term review should take place late in the&#13;
third year of the project (target date - November 2000). It would involve a social scientist&#13;
specialized in participatory approaches, an economist, specialists in irrigation, finance, project&#13;
management, off-farm/SME, and others according to need. The mid-term evaluation would&#13;
examine the status of project execution and impact, and follow up on the overall framework and&#13;
risk environment. It would also canvas the opinions of a representative sample of beneficiaries.&#13;
As necessary, it would propose restructuring or reallocation of funds and propose changes for the&#13;
continuation of the project.&#13;
Impact Evaluation&#13;
63.   Impact evaluation by an independent monitoring team would be conducted towards the&#13;
end of the project implementation period. It would be appropriate to repeat the exercise about&#13;
eight or nine years after project start up, i.e., two or three years after completion. The basic&#13;
reference would be the development objectives and the related performance indicators listed in&#13;
the design summary. Ways in which the second impact evaluation would be conducted and&#13;
financed (the evaluation would be well after the IDA Credit had closed) would be examined&#13;
during implementation and decided at the time of the first evaluation.&#13;
Completion Report&#13;
64.   Not later than six months after the completion of the project, the Government would&#13;
submit to IDA a Project Completion Report summarizing the achievements of the project and its&#13;
impact vis-a-vis objectives.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
SOUTHERN GOVERNORATES RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION AT THLE COMMUNITY LEVEL&#13;
1.    This is a participatory project: the design has been drawn up in a partnership between&#13;
communities, target group individuals, the consultant/Government preparation team, and IDA.&#13;
Participation and partnership are also the keynotes of implementation, where they would lead&#13;
through dialogue to the identification and implementation of a program of activities that are&#13;
priorities for the community in its development, and for the alleviation of the poverty of the&#13;
poorest members of the community. This program is designed to be the essential unifying&#13;
mechanism that would make the project's several components and geographical areas into an&#13;
implementable program.&#13;
2.    In each of the 40 communities with which the project would work, communities and&#13;
individual target group members would have to make choices about which components can and&#13;
should be implemented in their community. Project interventions would be based on a&#13;
participatory approach throughout the project area.&#13;
3.    Participation has been a fundamental theme of this project since the earliest days of&#13;
design, including the PNA, the preparation and appraisal missions and the work of the&#13;
Committee for the Selection of Beneficiaries (Chapter II). Different forms of participatory rural&#13;
appraisals have been implemented during preparation and similar though more detailed methods&#13;
would be used during implementation.&#13;
4.    During implementation, willingness to cooperate with the project on a participatory basis&#13;
will be an essential criterion in selection of communities. With respect to land development,&#13;
those communities covered by the work of the Committee for the Selection of Beneficiaries&#13;
have already agreed to a participatory methodology. Any community which meets other criteria&#13;
but is unwilling to join in the participatory process would not be included in project activities.&#13;
5.    The participatory process would be initiated through the selection of communities.&#13;
During the first year of the project, field staff would first identify the communities which have&#13;
high concentrations of poor dispossessed farmers and other poor people by studying the lists of&#13;
dispossessed and by consulting communities. Communities filling the outline criteria would be&#13;
approached and separate meetings with men and women held in the following sequence:&#13;
-  a first meeting would be arranged to include groups of up to 50 people (in larger&#13;
communities or in separate hamlets, it would be necessary to hold this meeting more&#13;
than once). During this meeting, project staff would introduce the project, its&#13;
methodology and criteria for inclusion, and its proposed activities, and answer any&#13;
questions which might arise;&#13;
-  a second meeting would be held at least one week later to discuss issues brought up&#13;
by the members of the community and to discuss whether; the community meets&#13;
project criteria and would like to participate in the project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
where necessary, further meetings would be held to create a committee in the&#13;
community (or to agree on the use of an existing committee) to be the prime&#13;
interface of project staff (either a community committee or, where land is being&#13;
allocated - a water user association WUA). In the case of a community committee,&#13;
the project would intervene as necessary to ensure that this committee is&#13;
representative of all social groups and strata living in or using the area;&#13;
- through the meetings and through discussions with subgroups of villagers and&#13;
committee members, a program of project related activities would be established&#13;
(agricultural extension, environmental awareness interventions, paraveterinarians,&#13;
proposals of candidates for off-farm income training, training activities for women,&#13;
etc.). The use of the community development fund (where available) would be&#13;
discussed in a series of meetings until it was firmly established that a particular&#13;
investment was the most effective form of investment support to the community, that&#13;
it met project economic, financial and sustainability criteria, that adequate&#13;
participation and cost-sharing were forthcoming, and that it would benefit people&#13;
equitably. The program would be established on an annual basis to ensure a&#13;
coherent plan in each community, but it would be flexible and subject to&#13;
modifications by negotiations between the project and the community; and&#13;
- throughout the project period, regular formal and informal meetings would be held&#13;
between project field staff and community members to jointly supervise, monitor&#13;
and manage project interventions. Community members would keep records of the&#13;
work of contractors, be they builders or extension agents and they would therefore&#13;
be the first line of monitoring of project investments. Training will be provided for&#13;
this purpose.&#13;
6.    On the project side, the dialogue would be led by participatory development coordinators&#13;
(PDCs), under the supervision of the chief technical advisor and with other back-up and&#13;
technical support as needed. In the first six months of the project, training of PMU staff and&#13;
further testing of the methodology would be carried out. By the end of the first year of the&#13;
project, it is expected that about five community programs would have been agreed.&#13;
7.    A GTZ-financed project "Innovation Development in the Agriculture Sector" (IDAS)&#13;
has been testing participatory methodology in two of the governorates concerned (Lahej, Abyan)&#13;
and it has been agreed that the two projects will cooperate in methodology, training and&#13;
programming.&#13;

PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
1.      The total project costs are estimated at US$45.8 million including taxes and duties.&#13;
Base costs are US$40.4 million and contingencies are US$5.4 million (13 percent of base&#13;
costs). The foreign exchange component is US$28.5 million or 62 percent of total project costs.&#13;
Project costs are estimated at March 1997 prices. The breakdown of costs by component is&#13;
shown in Table 2. Detailed cost tables are presented in Working Paper No. 20. Physical&#13;
contingencies are estimated at 8 percent of base costs and price contingencies were calculated&#13;
on the following domestic and international inflation rates.&#13;

B. Proposed Financing Plan&#13;
2.      The Bank would finance about 54 percent of project costs. These would comprise&#13;
irrigation improvement, about 50 percent of the crop development activities, funds for sector&#13;
study and future project preparation activities and the Project Management Unit (PMU); IFAD&#13;
would finance the off-farm activities including the fisheries, livestock, vocational training, start-&#13;
up capital and community development funds, which total US$ 11.3 million or 25 percent of the&#13;
total project costs; the beneficiaries will contribute 50 percent of the crop development costs&#13;
and a portion of the irrigation development component, which amounts to about 11 percent of&#13;
the project costs; and the government will finance the balance of US$4.4 million, or about 10&#13;
percent of the project costs.&#13;
C. Disbursement Schedule&#13;
The project is expected to be completed in 5 years. The estimated disbursement&#13;
schedule is given below:&#13;

            Republic of Yemen - Southern Governorates
            Rural Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The specific objectives of the Southern
            Governorates Rural Development Project are (1) to raise the
            incomes of very poor rural individuals and their families in
            the southern governorates of Yemen sustainably above the
            poverty level; (2) to promote overall economic and social
            development in extended rural communities with the target
            population, where there is a very high concentration of poor
            people; and (3) to test innovations that involve
            beneficiaries in planning and implementation, and that take
            a business approach to project management. The project
            components are five. The land allocation and development or
            rehabilitation component comprises a series of activities
            designed to establish very poor landless families within the
            target communities in sustainable new farming operations.
            Its subcomponents are (a) assigning secure title for lands
            to be developed or rehabilitated to largely dispossessed
            families; (b) developing and rehabilitating irrigated land,
            and setting up or reinforcing water monitoring; and (c)
            farmer services, including training and extension (using
            contract professionals), help to access credit for equipment
            and inputs, and material support to farm establishment. The
            off-farm income development component comprises three sets
            of activities to assist poor people in setting up or
            developing very small or small businesses, or in acquiring
            technical skills training needed to find remunerative
            employment:  a) training and equipping villagers,
            particularly women, to become animal health providers; b)
            training and equipping new entrants to the fisheries
            business on the south coast; and c) promoting other
            revenue-earning services and micro-enterprises. The economic
            and social development component, which targets communities,
            comprises two sets of activities: a) development of
            community management skills and institutions by providing
            training and logistical support to community organizations;
            and b) setting up a community development fund that finances
            small grants for community projects on a cost-sharing basis.
            The fourth component provides technical assistance and
            training to help prepare future projects in the sector. The
            fifth component consists of operating the Project Management
            Unit, which finances technical assistance, project staff,
            vehicles, office equipment, office rental, and operating costs.
