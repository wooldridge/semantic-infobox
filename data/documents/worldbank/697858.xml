MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE&#13;
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION&#13;
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A&#13;
PROPOSED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE CREDIT&#13;
TO BURUNDI&#13;
1.          I  submit for  your  approval the  following  memorandum   and&#13;
recommendation for a proposed Emergency Credit to Burundi for SDR 9.8 million&#13;
(US$14.6 million equivalent), on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help&#13;
finance an Emergency Assistance Project (EAP).  The Credit would support the&#13;
importation of high priority items on a broad positive list of imports, as IDA's contribution&#13;
to the Government's broader Emergency Recovery Program (ERP).&#13;
2.          The Emergency. On October 5, 1994, a new government was formed in&#13;
Burundi after a long transitional period characterized by violence and destruction. A year&#13;
earlier, three months after Burundi's first democratic elections, the President of Burundi&#13;
was assassinated together with the President and Vice-President of the National Assembly.&#13;
This gave rise to an outbreak of violence which continued into early 1994, costing more&#13;
than fifty thousand lives. In this critical situation, the National Assembly designated a new&#13;
President of Burundi in February 1994. On April 6, the new President was killed, together&#13;
with the President of Rwanda.  While Burundi succeeded in avoiding the ensuing&#13;
massacres that devastated Rwanda, these events aggravated long-standing ethnic tensions&#13;
and made it more difficult for the country's main ethnic groups to reach a consensus on&#13;
modalities of power sharing. Sporadic violence has continued to occur in parts of the&#13;
country. Encouraged by the intemational community, the Burundians worked out the&#13;
modalities for power sharing in a "Convention de Gouvernement", which was signed six&#13;
months later by 12 of the 13 political parties. The Convention's implementation has&#13;
begun: on September 30, the interim President was swom in as President followed by the&#13;
formation of a new government headed by the former Prime Minister. Progress has been&#13;
made in solving the politico-institutional crisis; the new equilibrium is fragile, however,&#13;
and needs to be consolidated through rapid and tangible improvement in the economic and&#13;
social conditions of the population.&#13;
3.          While overall destruction of public infrastructure was limited mainly to&#13;
communal buildings and small roads and bridges, the crisis caused a sharp drop in both&#13;
food production and the delivery of social services. This contributed to the human&#13;
hardship caused by the crisis, in terms of the breakdown of social bonds, widespread theft&#13;
and destruction of personal property. The health and education sectors were among those&#13;
most seriously affected. A sizable part of the health services personnel was killed or fled,&#13;
medical supplies and vehicles were stolen and distribution channels broke down. The&#13;
number of teachers declined by about 20% in primary schools and 40% in secondary&#13;
schools. Many primary schools have not reopened in rural areas, and enrollment rates&#13;
have dropped to less than 25% of the level of September 1993. Furthermore, the lack of&#13;
teachers and learning materials has severely affected the quality of education.  Re-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
establishment of basic social services to their normal levels would facilitate the return of&#13;
displaced persons and refugees to their homes.&#13;
4.           The agricultural sector, which accounts for about 50% of the country's&#13;
GDP, has suffered losses, primarily in the areas of livestock, food crop production and&#13;
forestry. The livestock population has been reduced by about 10%, while food production&#13;
in 1994 is estimated to have declined by some 22%. For the first time, Burundi has to rely&#13;
on large-scale food aid to meet its needs. Uncontrolled exploitation by refugees and&#13;
displaced persons has recently exacerbated the destruction of forest area, estimated&#13;
conservatively at about 20,000 ha.  Tools and seeds are needed urgently to enable&#13;
agricultural production to play its key role in getting economic growth back on the&#13;
positive track in 1995.&#13;
5.           Private sector activity, the main engine in Burundi's strategy for export-led&#13;
economic growth, was severely affected by the crisis. In urban areas, the level of&#13;
business confidence declined sharply and private investment came to a standstill due to&#13;
security concerns. In rural areas, many entrepreneurs lost some or all of their stocks&#13;
and equipment.  Preliminary estimates assess the destruction of business property&#13;
during the crisis at about US$20 million. Small scale enterprises were hit particularly&#13;
hard. Beyond the resumption of confidence in internal security, some direct assistance&#13;
to private entrepreneurs will be needed.&#13;
6.           The Economic and Financial Situation.  Prior to the political crisis,&#13;
Burundi had a mixed track record under the adjustment program, started in 1986 and&#13;
supported by three Structural Adjustment Credits from the Bank as well as SAF and&#13;
ESAF arrangements with the IMF. The country successfully implemented monetary&#13;
and foreign exchange policy reforms but encountered difficulties in limiting the role of&#13;
the public sector and reducing the fiscal deficit. During the adjustment period up to&#13;
1992, average growth in real GDP (3.7%) was above the SSA average. Following the&#13;
outbreak of severe disturbances, real GDP declined by 16% and the cost of living&#13;
increased by 28%  (1994 data compared to 1992 levels).  Over the same period,&#13;
government revenue fell by 35% in real terms due to the decline in business activity&#13;
and the collapse of external budgetary assistance. This brought about a fiscal crisis and&#13;
the accumulation of government arrears. By mid-September 1994, arrears exceeded the&#13;
equivalent of US$20 million, including US$6 million to external creditors. A number of&#13;
enterprises that had not been paid by government became unable to service their debts to&#13;
commercial banks, which, in turn, had to borrow  from  the Central Bank.  The&#13;
Government is beginning to take corrective measures so that this vicious circle does not&#13;
lead to a crisis of the banking system.&#13;
7.           Against this gloomy picture, the government's economic and financial&#13;
management has remained firm  throughout the crisis.  For example, government&#13;
current expenditures during the first eight months of 1994 were only two-thirds of their&#13;
level for the comparable period in 1993, in nominal terms. Moreover, the government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
has refrained from imposing any trade restrictions. This was made possible, in part,&#13;
by satisfactory reserve levels and the recent increase in world coffee prices.&#13;
8.           The government intends to continue its policies of prudent economic&#13;
management. The objectives for 1995 are to reduce the inflation rate to 10% from 17%&#13;
in 1994, and increase real GDP by 10% (to a level that would remain 8% below that of&#13;
1992). The government intends to restrict the budget deficit to a level that is compatible&#13;
with the inflation target and the private sector's credit requirements. Moreover, net&#13;
foreign exchange reserves would be kept at their end- 1993 level, to provide a comfortable&#13;
cushion against unforeseen shocks.&#13;
9.           Despite these sensible policies, the budgetary situation is expected to&#13;
remain tight for the remainder of 1994 -- particularly if all arrears are to be cleared -- as&#13;
well as in 1995 because of rehabilitation needs, especially in the social sectors. The&#13;
budget will also have to cover part of the cost of restructuring the banking system. In the&#13;
last quarter of 1994, approximately US$23 million would be needed in additional&#13;
budgetary assistance mainly for social sector spending and the repayment of arrears. For&#13;
calendar year 1995, Burundi would need US$246 million in total external assistance&#13;
(inclusive of technical assistance and humanitarian aid). This amount is 14% lower than&#13;
the 1991-92 average of US$286 million.&#13;
10.         The Government's Recovery Efforts.  Emerging from a widespread&#13;
paralysis caused by the political crisis, the transitional authorities acted simultaneously&#13;
on several fronts. On the political front, they promoted national reconciliation through&#13;
power sharing. Following a revision of the Constitution, a new president and&#13;
government were recently appointed. On the economic front, the government has&#13;
endorsed an Emergency Recovery Program (ERP), which was prepared with the help of&#13;
IDA. The government has already started to rehabilitate infrastructure in health and&#13;
education with the help of existing projects. Also, special training programs for newly&#13;
recruited primary school teachers have been initiated and school materials distributed to&#13;
orphans. Seeds have been distributed in affected areas to ensure an improved crop during&#13;
the next harvesting season.&#13;
11.         Mindful of its medium term development objectives, the government&#13;
invited the IMF and IDA in September 1994 to assist them in designing a macro-&#13;
economic framework for 1994 and 1995. The government's broad strategy was outlined&#13;
subsequently by the Minister of Finance during a donors' meeting in Paris on September&#13;
28, 1994.  The main objectives are to restore internal security in order to halt the&#13;
deterioration of the economic situation and establish a sound basis for an upturn in&#13;
economic activity. In January 1995, another IMF mission is scheduled to visit Burundi to&#13;
prepare the ground for a possible ESAF program. The policies envisaged to resume the&#13;
economic reform process will be outlined by the authorities in a Policy Framework Paper&#13;
(PFP) covering the period 1995 through 1997, to be agreed with the Bretton Woods&#13;
institutions in early 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
12.         IDA's Support to Recovery. IDA's assistance strategy will consist of&#13;
support to the recently appointed govemment to: (i) ensure the delivery of services in&#13;
priority sectors such as health services and primary and secondary education; (ii) help&#13;
coordinate emergency operations by the international community; and (iii) revive the&#13;
economic reform process. In order to achieve these objectives, a three-fold approach will&#13;
be pursued.&#13;
13.         First, in light of the changed conditions in the country, IDA has started to&#13;
restructure more than half (US$116 million) of the undisbursed project portfolio of&#13;
US$190 million. The projects identified for restructuring are in agriculture, the private&#13;
sector as well as infrastructure. The focus will be on rehabilitation, capacity building,&#13;
improved delivery of services and the promotion of the private sector through extensive&#13;
contracting out. Also, the Social Action Credit (US$10.4 million) which has recently&#13;
become effective will allow IDA to support the reconstruction effort in the areas of&#13;
rehabilitation of social infrastructure, capacity building at the local and central levels, and&#13;
labor intensive employment generating activities.&#13;
14.         Second, IDA has helped the government prepare the ERP, which involves&#13;
outlays totaling US$53 million over a period of about 13 months through early 1996. The&#13;
ERP would be supported by the proposed EAP (US$14.6 million), the allocation of funds&#13;
under ongoing IDA projects, and by other donors (Schedule A, Tables 2a and 2b). Third,&#13;
IDA is preparing to undertake new investment lending in the health, telecommunications&#13;
and other sectors, and resume the adjustment dialogue, initially through a medium-term&#13;
economic program. As indicated earlier, the PFP is now under preparation. The policy&#13;
discussion in the context of the PFP will serve to re-evaluate the content of the third&#13;
Structural Adjustment Credit (SACIII) and the timing of the release of its second tranche,&#13;
now scheduled for June 1995.&#13;
15.         IDA's assistance is being closely coordinated with that of other donors. A&#13;
number of donors, who will together contribute an amount of US$35.5 million,&#13;
participated in the preparation of the ERP. The ERP was discussed at a donors' meeting&#13;
in Paris on September 28, 1994. A follow-up round table meeting in Geneva will be&#13;
convened by UNDP in cooperation with IDA, in March 1995. Several donors have&#13;
expressed interest in participating in forthcoming reviews of the Public Investment&#13;
Program (PIP).&#13;
16.        Emergency Recovery Program  - Objectives and Description.  The&#13;
government's ERP aims at rebuilding capacity, addressing Burundi's most pressing social&#13;
needs, and restoring long-term economic growth potential. Its purpose is to minimize&#13;
social unrest and economic hardship, and help the country return to pursuing long-&#13;
standing human resource development objectives. The ERP will become an integral part&#13;
of Burundi's 1995 budget, and is based on estimated needs in five priority sectors (health,&#13;
primary and secondary education, agriculture, infrastructure and private sector).  It&#13;
comprises import finance, civil works and technical assistance to: improve the social&#13;
conditions of the population; create employment; rehabilitate infrastructure; and restore&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
basic government functions.  Total rehabilitation needs amount to US$53 million&#13;
(Schedule A, Table 1, column 2). For health and education, the most affected sectors,&#13;
special programs have been included such as: (i) a social fund for health, covering medical&#13;
expenses for parts of the population that cannot afford them, and technical assistance&#13;
necessary to hire and train qualified medical staff and provide employment incentives; and&#13;
(ii) special funds for education, to allow for the training of new teachers and financial&#13;
support of families and children severely affected by the crisis. Eligibility for subsidies&#13;
under the social fund will be subject to a certificate of hardship.  A proposal for&#13;
implementation of these schemes based on existing structures is under preparation by the&#13;
Ministries concerned. Not included in the ERP is humanitarian assistance to refugees&#13;
(total needs in 1994 are estimated at US$156 million), which is being provided through&#13;
continued direct donor financing coordinated by the UNDP. The key elements of the ERP&#13;
in each sector are summarized below.&#13;
17.          Health: US$18.7 million (35%). Health accounts for the largest part of&#13;
the ERP due to the extreme deterioration of the public health system and the top priority&#13;
attached by donors to the financing of current non-wage expenditures in the sector. These&#13;
expenditures, together with the constitution of appropriate working stocks of generic&#13;
drugs, account for about half of total costs to be financed under this component.&#13;
Rehabilitating health centers and providing needed equipment and vehicles that have&#13;
disappeared represent another 12% of total costs.  Three special programs account for&#13;
the remaining 39%: (i) strengthening management capabilities and providing temporary&#13;
technical assistance; (ii) improving the nutritional intake of children and feeding mothers;&#13;
and (iii) subsidizing the cost of medical insurance for those most affected by the recent&#13;
events (social fund).&#13;
18.          Primary and Secondary Education : US$18 million (34%).  After&#13;
having been closed for about five months, the public school system was reopened in&#13;
March 1994. However, enrollments in September 1994 were at least one quarter lower&#13;
than they were in September 1993, before the events; moreover, the quality of education&#13;
has deteriorated. The objective of the ERP is to help reverse the sharp drop in the&#13;
enrollment level in primary and secondary education and to ensure a minimum acceptable&#13;
level in the quality of education.  The rehabilitation and construction of classrooms&#13;
account for about half of total costs under this component; the purchase of text books&#13;
accounts for 22%; and that of other equipment and vehicles amounts to another 9%. The&#13;
remaining 17% cover three special programs: (i) training of teachers in areas of short&#13;
supply; (ii) providing education in basic democratic values proposed by UNDP; and (iii)&#13;
subsidizing education costs for orphans and children of displaced persons.&#13;
19.          Agriculture: US$9.6 million (18%).  Massive dislocation of the&#13;
population and persistent insecurity associated with the crisis have disrupted the rhythm&#13;
of agricultural activity, causing a decline in both production and marketing. Overall&#13;
needs for tools and seeds account for 60% of this component of the ERP. Rehabilitation&#13;
of rural infrastructure accounts for 28% of total cost and purchases of vehicles and&#13;
bicycles account for a further 9%. The remaining 3 % is devoted to improving the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
environment in areas damaged by fires (land development). A significant share (30%) of&#13;
emergency funds has already been committed under existing projects for distributing&#13;
seeds and tools and for rehabilitating small processing plants, such as coffee washing&#13;
stations.&#13;
20.         Infrastructure: US$3.5 million (7%).  Overall needs are limited to&#13;
US$1.5 million for repairs of small bridges, US$1.6 million for the replacement of&#13;
canalization tubes in Bujumbura and US$0.4 million for the rehabilitation of communal&#13;
buildings and small electrical repairs. Of the total amount, works valued up to US$1.0&#13;
million could be executed through labor intensive schemes by local communities&#13;
(administrative buildings, transport). Financing of overall sector needs has already been&#13;
secured.&#13;
21.          Private Sector: US$3.2 million (6%). Financing needs are limited to&#13;
two proposed operations benefiting low income groups. The first requires US$1.1 million&#13;
for the financing of labor intensive works in rural areas, such as reforestation and rural&#13;
infrastructure in areas not included under the Agriculture and Infrastructure allocation&#13;
discussed above. Already underway with donor support, these activities are crucial in&#13;
generating cash for the rural population and necessary for the resumption of small scale&#13;
trading and artisan activities. The second operation, which has already been initiated by&#13;
another donor agency, is estimated at US$2.0 million and seeks to provide low cost&#13;
financing for small rural investments.&#13;
22.          Financing Plan. The total estimated cost of the ERP in 1995 is US$53&#13;
million, to be expended over a 13-month period beginning in February 1995. Of this&#13;
amount, US$17.0 million represents secured financing, consisting of US$2.9 million of&#13;
IDA funds allocated under ongoing projects and US$14.1 million of assistance from other&#13;
donors, including Belgium, European Union, France, Germany, UNDP, and USAID.&#13;
Outstanding financing requirements of US$36.1 million are to be met as follows: US$14.6&#13;
million form IDA, under the proposed EAP; and a total of US$21.5 million in financing&#13;
from Belgium, European Union, and Germany (subject to final agency approval in some&#13;
cases). Needs covered under the ERP by sector and sources of funding are shown in&#13;
Schedule A, Tables I and 2 (also Technical Annex F), and reflected in the fiscal accounts&#13;
and the balance of payments (Technical Annex 1, Tables 5 and 6).&#13;
23.          ERP Implementation. The ERP would be fully implemented within 13&#13;
months. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the execution of the ERP (see&#13;
Technical Annex E, Chart 1). Five existing agencies, which are involved in coordinating&#13;
projects and activities in the respective sectors, will be responsible for implementing the&#13;
ERP: (i) the health project implementation unit; (ii) the education sector implementation&#13;
unit; (iii) the department of agricultural planning; (iv) the department of roads and&#13;
buildings; and (v) the private sector development implementation unit.   These&#13;
implementation units will have direct access to the Minister of Finance. They will follow&#13;
up on the execution of the project and facilitate fast identification and resolution of&#13;
implementation problems, as well as intersectoral and donor coordination. The Central&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Bank (BRB) will be in charge of preparing and submitting disbursement requests and&#13;
collecting relevant documents for private sector imports.&#13;
24.          The proposed project - EAP. The EAP (US$14.6 million), in addition to&#13;
US$2.9 million already reallocated to address sector needs under various projects in&#13;
agriculture, education, health and infrastructure (Schedule A, Tables 2a and 2b), would be&#13;
IDA's contribution to the ERP.  The Credit consists mainly of a quick-disbursing&#13;
component which will finance selected imports (Schedule B, page 1) supporting key&#13;
sectoral expenditures included in the ERP. In addition, a small amount (US$150,000) has&#13;
been included for technical assistance, including (i) audits, and (ii) contingency for&#13;
urgently required consultancy assignments not covered by other financing sources.&#13;
25.          The EAP has to be viewed as a catalyst for mobilizing emergency&#13;
assistance from other donors in a timely and organized manner. Out of the overall sectoral&#13;
needs included in the ERP, other donors are planning to provide direct budget support in&#13;
social sectors as well as general balance of payments support; also, a number of donors are&#13;
restructuring existing activities and proposing new ones. IDA would fill remaining gaps&#13;
under the ERP by financing priority imports.&#13;
26.          The proposed Credit would finance 100% of the foreign cost, insurance&#13;
and freight of goods imported from eligible sources based on a positive list of imports&#13;
(Schedule B, page 1). The import categories chosen correspond to the general needs of&#13;
the sectors. For agriculture, these categories correspond primarily to items 2, 3, 4, 9 and&#13;
11 of the positive list; for education, to items 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9; for health to the entire&#13;
positive list; for infrastructure, to items 1 through 5 and 7 through 9; and for the private&#13;
sector, to the entire positive list.  Specific amounts have been allocated to the five&#13;
components of the project corresponding to the five sectors (reflected in Schedule B,&#13;
Disbursements Category). The EAP will be implemented utilizing the arrangements&#13;
described for the ERP in paragraph 23 above. Procurement procedures are similar to&#13;
those established for the third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC III, Credit 2376-BU),&#13;
which have worked well. Retroactive financing (back to September 1, 1994) up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of SDR 1.96 million will be acceptable for eligible imports.&#13;
27.          Lessons Learned  From  Other Emergency  Operations.   Similar&#13;
operations in war-torn countries have shown the importance of (i) a simple program&#13;
design; (ii) an implementation scheme based on existing units; (iii) strong government&#13;
commitment with frequent communication between the Borrower and the Bank; and (iv)&#13;
well focused technical assistance. These lessons have been incorporated into the design of&#13;
the proposed operation.&#13;
28.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Country Assistance Strategy for&#13;
Burundi, presented to the Board on June 4, 1992, was geared to the country's long-term&#13;
development needs. It focused on the goals of promoting sustainable private sector-led&#13;
and export-oriented growth, poverty alleviation and a reduced role for the state. These&#13;
goals remain valid, but for the short term, IDA's strategy is to help the country meet its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
needs for immediate reconstruction and recovery. This will pave the way for resuming&#13;
implementation of the reform program.  The installation of a president and a new&#13;
government with full constitutional powers represents a crucial step towards the&#13;
restoration of peace and security, and the resumption of economic growth. At this critical&#13;
time, Burundi needs a resumption of donor assistance, which (excluding humanitarian&#13;
assistance) fell in 1994 to half its pre-crisis level. IDA involvement will serve as a catalyst&#13;
both for donor mobilization and for the coordination of emergency assistance of various&#13;
donors within the 1995 budget. Already, IDA's support, through the EAP, was found to&#13;
be essential in preparing the ERP, and government and the donors are looking for&#13;
continued IDA involvement.&#13;
29.          Agreed Actions.&#13;
a) ERP Management.  The implementation of the ERP will be&#13;
facilitated by using existing management units under the direction of the Minister of&#13;
Finance. Disbursement and procurement will follow procedures established under SAC&#13;
III and be handled by a service in the BRB. The ERP will be integrated into the 1995&#13;
budget which, in turn, will be prepared by the government in close cooperation with&#13;
the IMF, IDA and other donors.&#13;
b) Reform  Measures.  The appointment of a coalition government&#13;
representing the country's main ethnic groups indicates the authorities' willingness to&#13;
foster the peace process and national reconciliation. The government has adopted the&#13;
ERP and expressed its commitment to sound sectoral and economic policies. Policy&#13;
implementation will be facilitated by the preservation of continuity in key positions&#13;
(Minister of Finance, Minister of commerce and Governor of the Central Bank, in&#13;
particular) and the choice of qualified managers in other key positions (Minister of&#13;
Planning and Minister of Agriculture).&#13;
30.          Environmental Aspects. The EAP is not expected to have any negative&#13;
environmental impact (Environmental Rating C).&#13;
31.         Project Benefits. By providing support at a critical time and by triggering&#13;
coordinated assistance from the donor community, the proposed operation would help the&#13;
government restore basic conditions for economic and social recovery and continued&#13;
adjustment.  Timely assistance will help to reduce economic hardship and facilitate&#13;
economic recovery while providing a safety net for disadvantaged groups. At the same&#13;
time, it should improve the prospects for the return of political stability. The credit would&#13;
also enable the Bank to demonstrate its readiness to respond to the country's needs and&#13;
thereby sustain the momentum for reform. In the absence of this support, it would be&#13;
extremely difficult for the new government to prevent a further deterioration in the&#13;
economic and social conditions of the population, which could lead, in turn, to renewed&#13;
large-scale violence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
32.         Project Risks. The risks of political instability and a relapse into violence&#13;
are high, particularly if the situation does not improve in neighboring Rwanda and&#13;
instability prevails in the region. Moreover, project implementation would suffer if the&#13;
weakening of institutional capabilities experienced over the past twelve months does not&#13;
continue to be reversed. Indications of strong donor support for Burundi's recovery and&#13;
return to sustainable growth have already provided encouragement for finding solutions to&#13;
the political crisis. With a new government committed to peace, and economic reform&#13;
already in place, important steps have been realized towards the establishment of the&#13;
political and institutional pre-conditions for implementing the EAP and preparing the&#13;
ground for long-term recovery. Quick, positive results from the ERP would be an&#13;
important factor in reducing the risk of prolonged social hardship and renewed political&#13;
instability.&#13;
33.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit of SDR 9.8&#13;
million would comply with the Articles of the Association and recommend that the&#13;
Executive Directors approve it.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Assistance Project will
            assist the Government's Economic Recovery Program (ERP)
            aimed at rebuilding capacity, addressing Burundi's most
            pressing social needs, and restoring long-term economic
            growth potential. Its purpose is to minimize social unrest
            and economic hardship, and help the country return to
            pursuing long-standing human resource development
            objectives. The ERP will bececome an integral part of
            Burundi's 1995 budget, and is based on estimated needs
            in five priority sectors (health, primary and secondary
            education, agriculture, infrastructure and private sector).
            It comprises import finance, civil works annd technical
            assistance to: improve the social conditions of the
            population; create employment; rehabilitate infrastructure;
            and restore basic government functions. For health and
            education, the most affected sectors, special programs have
            been included such as: 1) a social fund for health, covering
            medical expenses for parts of the population that cannot
            afford them, and technical assistance necessary to hire and
            train qualified medical staff and provide employment
            incentives; and 2) special funds for education, to allow for
            the training of new teachers and financial support of
            families and children severely affected by the crisis.
