&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#152;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: My current niche in this system is the population and human resources work&#13;
in eight countries, which include Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar,&#13;
Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. And that's a very interesting mix because on the one&#13;
hand we have the kind of emerging mix--Korea, Malaysia, Thailand--which are doing&#13;
very well and where--in fact Korea has just within the last two weeks provided us with a&#13;
letter with a "graduation plan." So we're in the graduation phase of our relationship. In a&#13;
sense I'm sorry you're not going to visit Korea because we're at a point now where we&#13;
have had a very long institutional relationship with Korea which is just shifting gears and&#13;
where their views of how the Bank has supported their development success I think&#13;
would be a very poignant part of the spectrum in the stories that your group will be&#13;
telling.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Maybe I could explain. A case study is being written on Korea as part of the&#13;
history, but a Korean is doing this. It's because the idea of the history that will be, like&#13;
[Edward S.] Mason-[Robert E.] Asher, a history, but then in addition to that a second&#13;
volume of cases written by people who are looking at the Bank from the vantage point a&#13;
country, one Korea, or some other institution like the Fund [International Monetary&#13;
Fund] or the U.S. But one is Korea. Kim Mahn-Je is doing that with a partner, so that's&#13;
just a short reason why we're not going there. I understand what you're saying, certainly&#13;
have to become quite familiar with that.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: The countries that graduate, it's a very different frame of our--as I look&#13;
across the spectrum of these countries, and one of the things that is nice about this group&#13;
is that it is such a wide spectrum--that the whole character of the Bank's relationship with&#13;
a country like Korea is completely different than the character of a relationship with a&#13;
country like the Philippines which is almost like an accident-prone child that continually&#13;
seems to be stumbling and needing to be helped up and encouraged to move along, or&#13;
countries like Vietnam, where we're now just beginning our relationship, weâ&#128;&#152;re really at&#13;
the--and Cambodia, where we really have never been active. We made one loan to&#13;
Vietnam in 1978, but we basically have had no relationship with the country ever of any&#13;
significance, and now we are just at the beginning stages of structuring that relationship.&#13;
And both in Cambodia and Vietnam it will be a major goal for the Bank in the next ten&#13;
years to help these countries, the whole Indochina system of relations and economic&#13;
interaction, mature and integrate within the region. And the Mekong system which has&#13;
five riparian nations, the Mekong Committee and the Bank's role in facilitating the&#13;
transnational decision-making around those resources is going to become a prominent&#13;
feature of our involvement in the region, I think, over the next five years when the&#13;
political conditions now are allowing these countries to begin to interact and coordinate&#13;
their decision-making a little bit. Not quite there yet. I mean, the Cambodian accords&#13;
will be signed next week. They did come to the Annual Meetings. We invited them to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
come to the Annual Meetings, we kept at it. They did have a meeting with the Bank last&#13;
week. And we're quite active now in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible] the U.S. saying, â&#128;&#149;Okay, lend?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
â&#128;&#151;&#13;
BABSON: Well, it's not just the U.S. I mean, it's the U.S. and the Japanese and the&#13;
Europeans. And the Europeans, particularly the French, are taking the lead in trying to&#13;
come up with a financing solution to the arrearages that the Vietnamese have with the&#13;
Fund which have to be sorted out before we can begin lending.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Are you hiring any young diplomats?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Young diplomats?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. This kind of workâ&#128;&#148;it sounds as if the work has changed character from&#13;
what the Bank has been doing 10, 20 years ago. I donâ&#128;&#152;t know of a--well, some kind of&#13;
international wheeling and dealing, diplomatic . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: There's an element of that. Vietnam's a good example because last year--and&#13;
our methods are changing a little bit. Instead of relying only on doing economic and&#13;
sector reports where we come in, a bunch of outsiders, analyze, collect information, write&#13;
something, we do that--we continue to do that--but in the case of Vietnam in how to&#13;
provide guidance and encouragement on some of the reform efforts that they are now&#13;
undertaking, the approach that we used was to organize in effect a seminar and to bring in&#13;
some of the people from Indonesia and from Korea and from Thailand who have guided&#13;
the policy processes in thinking of the development experiences in those countries and&#13;
created opportunities for the Vietnamese leadership to interact with these people in a very&#13;
informal but very sort of constructive kind of setting where the lessons of that experience,&#13;
their reflections on what worked and what didn't work and how they handled their&#13;
relations with the external donor community and lots of things that concern the&#13;
governments that are just getting started, a much more effective, in my view, way of&#13;
providing, creating opportunities for learning and building bridges which has more to do&#13;
with stage setting and facilitating than it does with producing a piece of product with the&#13;
Bank's name on it. And I see that that type of role is something, particularly in the more--&#13;
because there has been so much experience with development now, I think that we don't&#13;
just see ourselves as somehow the agent of development in the sense of finding the&#13;
people who know and bringing it to the people who don't know and transferring&#13;
knowledge or experience that way, but creating contexts in which experiences can be&#13;
shared. People can learn from each other. They can be brought together in a way that&#13;
creates value added.&#13;
&#13;
Some of the work weâ&#128;&#152;ve been doing--I'll give you another example of that approach&#13;
which we've been using in the area of health finance. We found a number of the&#13;
industrializing countries of Asia are at the stage in their development when they're&#13;
thinking seriously about health insurance, and the Koreans adopted a policy of&#13;
universalizing health insurance. It's an issue in Malaysia. It's an issue in the Philippines,&#13;
&#13;
                                  Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                            October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in Fiji, Indonesia, Thailand. And all of them--a number of them had come to us saying,&#13;
"Weâ&#128;&#152;d like--we feel uncomfortable with the issues in this area. As you look around&#13;
OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries there are&#13;
very mixed stories about the way theyâ&#128;&#152;ve organized their health systems, the&#13;
public/private sector role, share of public financing, private financing, the role of health&#13;
insurance. There isn't an obvious answer to the right path to go in these sorts of questions,&#13;
but we sure don't want to end up like the United States, which is very high cost. We can't&#13;
afford that outcome. It may or may not have attributes which are worth learning from, but&#13;
we certainly don't want to be spending 12 percent of GNP on health if we can avoid it."&#13;
That's the kind of feeling that they get, exposed to these kinds of issues.&#13;
&#13;
So what we did was we worked on a, with EDI [Economic Development Institute] , to&#13;
very carefully between the region and EDI, to organize a seminar and to bring the people&#13;
from these countries who were worrying about these issues together and commissioned a&#13;
series of case studies of the histories of how policy choices were made in a number of&#13;
OECD countries, including Korea and some Latin American experience, and brought a&#13;
number of thinkers. In fact, Uwe Reinhardt was one of the people we got involved, and&#13;
he wrote the paper on the U.S. He and Bill Hsiao from Harvard came to sort of manage&#13;
the overall discussion in that seminar. And that was very--we didn't have a Bank point of&#13;
view. Basically we took the position that we, we're learners in this process. No one else&#13;
seems to have figured it out fully, but we'll be partners with these countries in trying to&#13;
go to a process of mining the experience of other countries that have been through it, to&#13;
pull that together in writing and to create a forum in which the issues can be discussed&#13;
and at least a framework for thinking about how to proceed at the national level could&#13;
emerge.&#13;
&#13;
That has now led to a spin-off in terms of our country-level work in five or six countries,&#13;
a follow-up in studies and in policy analysis and to some extent the shape of our&#13;
discussions about lending in the future, which I think is a very effective way for the Bank&#13;
to be operating in these kinds of areas, where we don't present ourselves as having the&#13;
answers but to--being able to find the people who can engage in the right kinds of&#13;
discussions to clarify whether the questions are the right questions or the analytical&#13;
approaches that are appropriate to pursue the issues in different contexts are the right&#13;
ones to be pursuing, what kind of research agenda really makes sense for this country or&#13;
that country, and what kind of intellectual and other resources could be mobilized to help&#13;
individual countries down their own paths. And it's that kind of facilitating role which has&#13;
come back to us very strongly in terms of the Bank's credibility on an issue where we&#13;
really can't say that we have a standard answer, but we can be seen as a partner in a&#13;
process to help them think it through and to address the questions.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: How long have you been doing this kind of work?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, I've been in this job since the reorganization which was now, what,&#13;
four and a half years, going on five years.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Here in this region still?&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Same. I mean, this job, education, health, family planning, in this group of&#13;
countries for the last four and a half years.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's pretty stable for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yes, well, itâ&#128;&#152;s been--there hasn't been a push, and there hasn't been a pull. I&#13;
haven't felt a desire to go elsewhere. There are fertile fields to do interesting, useful&#13;
things in this group of countries. From my point of view, this has been just a dream&#13;
assignment, and so far no one has been pulling me out to do anything else or pushing me&#13;
out to do anything else. That may change, but I think for the last four years it's been a&#13;
very satisfying role.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Have you seen the job evolve as, in four and a half years, or changed in&#13;
character?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I would say yes because--and this may be a reflection on the reorganization.&#13;
When, in my sector, in this group of countries, the Bank had not been very active in the&#13;
period five years before the reorganization. I inherited a portfolio of about ten project&#13;
loans, most of which would have been negotiated in the late 1970s, very early 1980s.&#13;
There had only been about five new projects in the three or four years prior to the&#13;
reorganization in these sectors in these countries. That was partly because they weren't&#13;
the big deal countries in Asia. So when we had a centralized population department, they&#13;
had worldwide orientation, and they focused their efforts in Asia on the big countries, on&#13;
India, on Bangladesh, on Indonesia, to some extent the Philippines, but the other&#13;
countries were small, difficult, not major players in the big demographic issues of the&#13;
region by numbers, and they were just to some extent prickly countries to work with,&#13;
difficult countries to work with. The Malaysians are very sensitive. The Thais are not all&#13;
that interested in borrowing in the social sectors. No one had ever even thought to ask the&#13;
Laotians whether this was an area that they would like to work with the Bank. The&#13;
Philippines is, because of the Catholic culture, a very difficult environment to do&#13;
population work.&#13;
&#13;
And education similarly. There had been a regional education division, but again most of&#13;
its activities were focused on Indonesia and countries that were major clients of the Bank,&#13;
although there was certainly a larger role there. But by putting those countries and those&#13;
sectors together under one management orientation, basically my mandate was to see&#13;
what real scope for Bank involvement in human resources in these countries is, with not&#13;
having to compete with Indonesia or China or India for resources or management&#13;
attention. So I saw my job after the reorganization as testing the market and seeing&#13;
whether the Bank really had anything to offer to these countries. Many of them, like&#13;
Korea and Malaysia, don't need to borrow from the Bank, so if there's a role for us, it's&#13;
because we can provide something that they consider valuable, not--in this sector&#13;
resource transfer is not that easy because a lot of expenditures are in local currencies.&#13;
Then the question is, is there a role for the Bank in human resources in these kinds of&#13;
environments or not. The answer turns out to be yes.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
My program has grown enormously since the reorganization including in, surprisingly, in&#13;
the most advanced countries of the group. I'd say my strongest lending now is in Korea&#13;
and Malaysia, and I've been lending two or three loans a year to Korea, and I'm at the&#13;
moment preparing four loans for Malaysia in help in education which will be delivered&#13;
over the next 18 months. And I think in Malaysia we're now the dominant sector. In&#13;
Korea we're now the dominant sector in the Bank's overall lending relationship. At the&#13;
same time, as we moved into work in the lower income countries, the Philippines is all&#13;
over the map. We're active there in education and health. Weâ&#128;&#152;ve just published this&#13;
month a sector study on population. We're now going to be working toward lending in&#13;
population now that they're back as an IDA [International Development Association]&#13;
borrower. That will make it easier for us, and we have a real agenda in the Philippines.&#13;
But it's a difficult environment to work in because the macroeconomic conditions keep&#13;
somehow washing over our sectoral activities.&#13;
&#13;
And as we're now getting geared up in Laos and Vietnam and Cambodia, it's basic&#13;
education, basic health services, basic family planning issues are ones that the&#13;
governments are giving a very high priority to. So Iâ&#128;&#152;m very active in Laos, got to&#13;
appraise a major primary education program. We've written a sector study on health and&#13;
population there, and we're now in the project preparation phase of our first health&#13;
project. We are about to appraise, although we're not saying so officially, our first&#13;
primary education project in Vietnam next month, and we will be producing a major&#13;
report on population, health, and nutrition in Vietnam this year. We've had the mission,&#13;
and it's now under the sort of the report-writing phase. And we've identified and initiated&#13;
preparation of our first health project in Vietnam. There will be a series of health and&#13;
population interventions there over the next four or five years.&#13;
&#13;
We haven't started work in Cambodia yet, but again the basic human issues, public health&#13;
and trying to jump-start the education system where they killed most of the teachers in&#13;
the 1970s, dealing with the terrible demographic distortions that exist in that country in&#13;
the sex ratio and the age profile, and helping to try to track the implications of that&#13;
through the development planning effort are sort of the agenda that we have there that we&#13;
haven't even scratched the surface on yet. So I see a major involvement of our human&#13;
resources sector in the addressing of the basic needs of those newly emerging clients of&#13;
the Bank and is where I think our emphasis is going to shift, as Korea graduates and as&#13;
Malaysia reduces its overall level of borrowing from the Bank, that our effort will shift&#13;
from the sort of high-tech orientation toward the industrializing economies and helping&#13;
them acquire the more advanced skills for the industrialization effort that they're involved&#13;
in, which is what we've been focusing on, to focusing more of our resources and energy&#13;
on these new, emerging, very poor, IDA-oriented clients in this country group.&#13;
&#13;
So I see this is, you know, a program that has really just blossomed since the&#13;
reorganization, and I think the reorganization had a lot to do with it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Why is that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I think it's because it put someone like me in the role of saying, you know,&#13;
"You're responsible for these sectors in these countries. You don't have to worry about&#13;
other sectors, and you don't have to worry about Indonesia or India. Your job is to find&#13;
out what the right thing for the Bank should be doing in these countries in your sectors. It&#13;
may be very different things in Korea and the Philippines." And I spent the first two years&#13;
really defining the agenda, getting to know my counterparts, spent a lot of time traveling,&#13;
getting to work out basically an understanding with each country what the critical issues&#13;
where the Bank could be playing a useful role were, and they're quite different.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: How would it have been different from, say, the years â&#128;&#151;72 to â&#128;&#152;80, when you&#13;
had the South Asian and East Asia, and China was not yet a member of the East Asia&#13;
[both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, in those days, you see, you had a project division, the education&#13;
division handled everything in--well, in those days East Asia. And so when China&#13;
became a member of the Bank, there was enormous allocation of resources towards&#13;
building up the education program in China. And the same thingâ&#128;&#148;and Indonesia has&#13;
been a very major borrower in education for many, many years. So Indonesia and China&#13;
basically consumed the vast majority of resources that the region put into education.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Could that not be true, for example, in the â&#128;&#151;80s?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, before 1980 the Bank didn't have much of a population or health&#13;
policy. It was a very small, centrally managed department. It was getting started really in&#13;
the late '70s. I mean, it wasn't until about '76 or '77 that the Bank even started any&#13;
population lending--anywhere in the world.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: â&#128;&#152;72.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: It was the first one. Well, it didn't really [both speaking at once] engage. I&#13;
mean, the country--we started work in the Philippines in around '74, and we had two&#13;
projects, one in the early '70s, one in the late '70s, that percolated through. We had a&#13;
Thailand program in those days. We had a Malaysia program and a Korea program. But&#13;
in the case of Korea we had a one-shot involvement that was very successful but then&#13;
they didn't really need us anymore, and they didnâ&#128;&#152;t--there wasn't much that the Bank&#13;
could offer that they couldn't do on their own in this field.&#13;
&#13;
Same thing in Thailand. We had a very successful project in Thailand, a very difficult&#13;
one to implement in terms of our understanding the way they worked and their&#13;
understanding the way we worked. But the fact is that it was, in my view, an extremely&#13;
successful project in creating capacity and helping them down the road. And again, they&#13;
don't need us in this field in Thailand anymore--or, at least, they don't feel that they need&#13;
us. My feeling is that in the AIDS issue currently in Thailand they ought to be working&#13;
with the Bank, but they don't want our help.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I'm trying to understand how this happens. You get this considerable growth in&#13;
resources in this area. I don't mean the kinds of--to what extent was this being driven by&#13;
an allocation decision in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: It's not. I mean I'll give you a personal rendering of this, which is my&#13;
strategy, to be honest, is not to take the budget that seriously. My feeling has been if I had&#13;
real work to do, if there was a client with whom I could establish a relationship and&#13;
where I had a clear understanding about the agenda that the Bank should be following in&#13;
that country in this sector, if there was something specific, whether a sector study or a&#13;
project that was worth doing on its own merits that was in that agenda and there was&#13;
motivation on the client's side, then we should do it and not take the budget as a&#13;
constraint. And if that meant that we overspent the budget, then we go and we say, â&#128;&#149;We&#13;
have something real to do, you know, and I need the resources to do a real thing.â&#128;&#150; But&#13;
I've not operatedâ&#128;&#148;and as I think I've taken my responsibility to (A) make sure that the&#13;
activities we're involved in are appropriate ones, that they're ones where the Bank can&#13;
make a difference by being involved, adding value to whatever it is, that we can do it--but&#13;
we can come back to how we do that--and that if the client wants it, and it's real and it&#13;
makes sense, that somehow the money, the resources, will find their way to follow up and&#13;
support it.&#13;
&#13;
I've operated with that assumption, often spending my consultants budget, committing all&#13;
of it or almost all of it by mid-year, and then going into the mid-year review saying, "This&#13;
is a real work program, and these are the missions we need to carry out to move this&#13;
down the road," and asking for additional resources in mid-year review, mainly for&#13;
consultants to help us keep the momentum going. And so far no one said no. I mean, on&#13;
the margin at the end of the year I may trim a mission here or there or slip it a few weeks&#13;
in order to cross the end of fiscal year deadline if thereâ&#128;&#152;s, when we start counting pennies&#13;
at the end of the year, are real issues. But frankly I haven't found the budget system in&#13;
fact to be a constraint, but I haven't behaved as if it was a constraint. And I have been&#13;
given, slowly, incremental positions over the years, first one and then a shift in the TD&#13;
[Technical Department] , and then another one last year and another one this year and&#13;
building up slowly the base of staff. But in competing for CAMS resources, my CAM&#13;
work program has gone up steadily every year.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What is CAMS? I donâ&#128;&#152;t know that.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: That's the Country Assistance Management System, which is what drives the&#13;
work program. It takes a country work program, translates it into staff weeks or staff&#13;
years of effort by task as you build it up from the task level, and you--that becomes a sort&#13;
of staff/week budget that you work with to perform a particular work program, in my&#13;
case made up of the specific lending and sector work and supervision activities in this&#13;
year in these countries.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is there somewhere in the Bank, then, a cultural man-years spent on each&#13;
country?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Sure, I mean that's all in the computer system. Itâ&#128;&#152;s a planning system so that&#13;
we haveâ&#128;&#148;we know what we're spending per country and by task within a country, and&#13;
we have a planning vehicle for that. We update it at mid-year. We monitor what we're&#13;
actually spending against it. We also do an input plan which is how much of those staff&#13;
weeks come from staff in my own division, staff in the technical departments that I&#13;
contract with to perform work for me, consultants, input people from other parts of the&#13;
Bank to do it on an ad hoc basis, and we can track all of that. We do an ex ante plan and&#13;
we do an ex post analysis of whether weâ&#128;&#148;whether the sourcing of the inputs worked out&#13;
along the line that we did our budgeting.&#13;
&#13;
But I've never taken the budget as in effect the constraint. Itâ&#128;&#152;s basically--at my level in&#13;
assistance, I viewed it as a planning vehicle against which, if there was something more&#13;
to do, then you say, "Let's do something new" and then make a case for the need for&#13;
incremental resources to do it or occasionally to switch priorities and to back off things.&#13;
But I must say in lending it's very difficult to do that. It's very hard to say that you should&#13;
trade off a project in one country for a project in another country. It's very difficult at my&#13;
level to say that there are real switching opportunities in resource allocations either in&#13;
terms of the source of money or in terms of people. Sometimes the projects you might&#13;
want to switch out of aren't the ones with the skills that you need. In my sector, if I decide&#13;
to delay a health project in Laos by a year, that doesn't mean I can turn around and do an&#13;
education project in Korea just like that, even within the same staff/week budget. It&#13;
depends on who's available to do the work.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You're really the highest instance for population and human resources in the&#13;
Bank, aren't you? There's nothing at a more central level?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: There is a central department which Ann Hamilton runs which is in the PRE&#13;
[Policy, Research and External Affairs] complex. They maintain a kind of--not an&#13;
oversight, but they keep an overview of what we're all doing in all of these different units&#13;
around the Bank in these sectors. For example, they produce every year a report on what&#13;
happened the year before in the sectors, how many loans were done, what the issues&#13;
were, what the supervision problems in the portfolio across the Bank were, so that there&#13;
is a sectoral overview function that is located in the PRE complex.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: How does that work in practice? How do you see it?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, in [both speaking at once] practice, from the point of view of simply&#13;
collecting information and putting it together and creating a Bank-wide story, it's an&#13;
important function. It has to be done. Otherwise, we lose the sectoral context of the&#13;
Bank's work. We've chosen to organize primarily along geographic lines, but the Bank in&#13;
its operational work is very much a sectoral organization, you know, and educators--the&#13;
fact that we're all split up in little units all over the place doesn't mean that the educators&#13;
don't want to feel as part of the community of education sector staff in the Bank. But&#13;
every time the Bank is reorganized, if you go back over the series of organization charts,&#13;
you find that we differentiate the number of bottom and line units. There are a larger&#13;
number of smaller units. Itâ&#128;&#152;s almost--if you go back to 1972, the last one when they&#13;
&#13;
                                  Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                            October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
regionalized projects--it used to be central area departments--all of a sudden there were&#13;
six regional departments and function project divisions. Before that it was even a smaller&#13;
aggregation. So if you go back and look at the history of organization change in the Bank,&#13;
itâ&#128;&#152;s always been towards creating a more complex organization structure, a larger number&#13;
of smaller units.&#13;
&#13;
The implication of that is every time we become more complex at the micro level, it&#13;
raises the issue, the complexity of the resource deployment questions in resource&#13;
allocation, whether it's people and the whole issues, discussion around career&#13;
development, reassignment, et cetera, the more units there are, the more complicated it is&#13;
to have a person work, shift from country A to country B. They have to go across a unit&#13;
boundary. Just take population staff. Before the reorganization one guy could work on&#13;
Nigeria and the Philippines. Now you can't. You either have to be in Asia or in Africa.&#13;
Before the reorganization in education you could work on China and Malaysia. You can't&#13;
do that now. You either work on China or Malaysia unless you're in the technical&#13;
department. So it--we've created a lot more complication for redeploying resources in the&#13;
Bank, which is why I think that there is so much attention at the moment being given to&#13;
try to think through how to get the personnel processes to work better. To some extent I&#13;
think--my own personal view is--this is a function of organizational choice that has put&#13;
enormous demands on the personnel and the budget systems for redeploying to create&#13;
processes and capacity to redeploy resources because there are many more managers and&#13;
decision makers involved now than there used to be.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Does the technical department help you?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In practice?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: These issues that you're trying to work out with these different countries,&#13;
looking at different health systems, is that the kind of thing that they can help you with?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Absolutely. They--in fact, most of the--my work program is a little unusual.&#13;
Only about a, less than a third of the work in my work program is performed by my own&#13;
divisional staff. About a third is performed by staff in the technical department, and about&#13;
a third by consultants.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And PRE?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Almost nothing. I don't depend on PRE for anything because no matter what&#13;
you agree, they're never there when you need them. So my attitude is if you are purely ad&#13;
hoc or when thereâ&#128;&#152;s a very definite synergy between their research agenda and our&#13;
operational agenda, we can do it as partners. We've done some country studies together in&#13;
which I put in some sector work resources, they put in their own research budget, and we&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
get a country case study on something where we both are interested. That works. But to&#13;
get them actually to do project work, unless there is something in it to their research&#13;
interests or policy interests, doesn't work. I just, you know, I've given up trying to use&#13;
them that way.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I'm not sure, but one thing which is what you were reflecting onâ&#128;&#148;post-â&#128;&#152;87--&#13;
again I'm sort of thinking of the '70 to '80 [inaudible] efforts and wondering how much of&#13;
the changes that you see are because of organizational structure and how much are&#13;
because of different agendas of the presidents.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I think it has a lot less to do with agendas of the presidents than the agendas&#13;
of people in the front-line divisions, the freeing up of people in the last reorganization to&#13;
do that. See, it--I mean, in my view the reorganization of '87 accomplished what it set&#13;
out to do, which was to give country directors and SOD [sector operations division]&#13;
chiefs a lot more degrees of freedom in making judgments about what they ought to be&#13;
doing and how they ought to go about doing it. And it allowed entrepreneurial behavior--&#13;
and I put myself in an entrepreneurial category for what I've done the last few years. I&#13;
was asked to be an entrepreneur and to use the new structure to see whether the Bank&#13;
couldn't create a role in business for itself in the sectors in these countries where we&#13;
really weren't very active and pretty creaky. And in my view it worked. I mean, I adopted&#13;
an entrepreneurial strategy, and we now--I'm sending six appraisal missions this fall,&#13;
three pre-appraisal, and we really have a cranked-up lending program. Easily I can&#13;
provide somewhere between four and five loans a year in my portfolio, and I don't really&#13;
want to do any more than that. Even that's a little heavy.&#13;
&#13;
But I think that that strategy has worked. The organization allowed me to do it. It only&#13;
required a certain amount of chutzpah on my part to go and to test whether there is&#13;
potential demand for Bank, agree on the specific things that we could do that the clients&#13;
would find helpful, find ways of doing it that they--experiences being responding to their&#13;
interests not responding to the Bank's needs, and just not taking the budget all that&#13;
seriously and just doing it and finding the people who had the skills to do it. That's why&#13;
I've relied very heavily not on my own staff, but on the TD and consultants because in&#13;
that mix of countries with that mix of issues it's not very reasonable to expect a small&#13;
group of people sitting in one group of offices are going to have the set of skills to have&#13;
that kind of relationship and impact. So what I've done is to try to have orchestrators.&#13;
And I've recruited people who could be orchestrators, mobilizing expertise from&#13;
wherever it really made sense to get it to work on the issues, so that with health insurance&#13;
we go out and we get Uwe Reinhardt and Bill Hsiao and others like them from other&#13;
countries to come together and to give us support or . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Are they orchestrators? You're talking about your own staff.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: No, my own staff, or staff in the TD.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What do you mean by "an orchestrator"?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, somebody who can mobilize at the task level. I view my role as the&#13;
program level, and I view the role of what the Bank now calls the task manager is&#13;
basically to orchestrate the way of accomplishing the task in a way that will provide the&#13;
most benefit to the country. That means like, for example, in Vietnam where we're&#13;
working now on textbooks, the whole approach to textbooks is--they have a series of&#13;
state-owned textbook publishing entities which provide very poor quality textbooks at&#13;
totally unrealistic prices--and so our whole effort there in trying to improve the quality of&#13;
primary education, one of the thrusts is to get the whole textbook production/distribution&#13;
system functioning in a more efficient way. Now, how do you take a country that's doing&#13;
it all wrong and get it to do it better? The answer is you get some of the people who've&#13;
been really running national textbook programs in developing countries to go assess and&#13;
transfer some of their experience, people from the textbook corporation in the Philippines&#13;
who go out as consultants and people from Africa and now we're using people from the&#13;
U.K. But basically I view the role of the task manager, in having defined that there is an&#13;
issue around textbooks, to find the consultants that will really give the Vietnamese the&#13;
best advice as to how to do it properly, and if that's somebody who's been running the&#13;
textbook corporation in the Philippines, then we hire her for two weeks to come do it.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But surely there is to an extent a finite resource envelope for a region or a&#13;
country. Within that envelope, if, say, one looks at the figures the last three years and say&#13;
three years in the '70s, the relative share of, say agriculture and social sector has really&#13;
switched. What used to be the share of agriculture is almost but not quite the share of&#13;
social sector and vice versa, which means that if one sector is increasing its share, by&#13;
definition other sectors have to be reducing in their relative share. So that in all these&#13;
areas of--sort of where you always had these who are all sort of advancing their, what&#13;
they believe is important for the country. How are those allocated because then you start&#13;
to have a zero sum game?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yeah, well, there are two questions. One is, is there overall growth in the&#13;
program . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: . . and is there switching occurring in this sort of sectoral composition. And I&#13;
think it's important to distinguish the two questions because at one level it's the Bankâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
the Bank opted around 1980 to view the strategic business unit as the country, and so&#13;
basically the idea is what role should the Bank be playing and what level of effort in this&#13;
country and what is the country agenda, is the balance of activity between different&#13;
sectors. And we have a series of management processes around that question, the country&#13;
program papers and the articulation of country strategies and how that guides what we do&#13;
in our sectoral context. And I think if you start with that, then the question is should we&#13;
be in an expansive--in that context you can deal with the switching issues. You can deal&#13;
with whether the program should be growing in the Philippines or shrinking, whether we&#13;
should be shifting more emphasis on social versus agriculture, or what. So that's the&#13;
vehicle by which those kinds of questions and a kind of notional work program are&#13;
worked out. And it's easiest to tackle at the country level.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the sort of conceptual argument about the way, what we should be doing&#13;
and why and what the level of effort should be and how that's related to economic&#13;
analysis at various times, there is the question on the practical side of it, whether you&#13;
have relationships in these sectors or they want to work with you, you know, whether the&#13;
minister likes the Bank or doesn't like the Bank, whether you've established a rapport at&#13;
the working level where things take on a life and momentum of their own. Where does&#13;
the creativity in the system come from? Is it imported from the Bank or is it really sui&#13;
generis in that subsystem within the country and are we there basically to feed it and to&#13;
support it?&#13;
&#13;
There are enormous differences even within the same country, across sectors and&#13;
agencies and over time, as people change, leadership changes, in the conditions for doing&#13;
good development work. To some extent you can work out all the lovely conceptual&#13;
arguments, but at another extent you go back to development in a kind of opportunistic&#13;
way. You get the right issues with a group of people who have the motivation and the&#13;
skill and the political clout to address it, and you take it, if you see an opportunity and&#13;
say, "On this subject now we can do something. Let's go with it."&#13;
&#13;
And there is an opportunistic element to doing effective development work, particularly&#13;
in countries that really don't need the Bank, I mean theyâ&#128;&#152;re--in the sense that they're not&#13;
so out of whack on the macroeconomic front that they've become dependent on&#13;
adjustment lending. If the country's in a dependency relationship with the Bank, that's an&#13;
entirely different ballgame, but that's not true in my group of countries. They're not&#13;
dependent on the Bank--maybe with the exception of the Philippines--and the only reason&#13;
we're there is because we have something that they find valuable. You'll find this true in&#13;
Indonesia, too. But it's not a question of we're saying, "If you don't do what we want, we&#13;
won't bail you out." It's not that kind of situation. It's a situation where they're pretty&#13;
much in control of their own economies and development process, and there are areas,&#13;
issues, opportunities where we can come in and do something useful. And that leads me&#13;
to take a somewhat eclectic view of how we should conceptualize our role in some of&#13;
these countries where it should be sort of very selective on those issues where we feel we&#13;
can do something useful, and the opportunity is there, and the timing is right, rather than&#13;
driven by a kind of inductive reasoning from the economy on down, which has been the&#13;
more traditional approach.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And yet at the same time I think you said you don't travel as much as your&#13;
predecessors.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I'm not sure that's true. I traveled quite heavily during that first phase, partly&#13;
because there were so many countries and wanting to establish an understanding and a&#13;
rapport with the--really, I view my counterpart as the secretary or director general level.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Of health?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Of health or education, usually the education ministry, the health ministry. If&#13;
there's a population commission or something like that or a nutrition commission, the&#13;
executive director or the director general, that's the level that I pitch my counterpart&#13;
relations. I know the ministers. I usually see them when I'm there, but frankly I think it's&#13;
at the secretary general level, the guy who's running the show, that the most important&#13;
counterpart relationship has to be created at my level. And then my staff really have their&#13;
major relationships at the directorship level where the work is actually done. But I like to&#13;
go on mission to agenda-set and to agree with that level and with the core agencies on&#13;
what are the major priorities for what we should be doing over the next year or two and to&#13;
get feedback from them informally on what they've gotten out of what we've done&#13;
recently. So I get an independentâ&#128;&#148;I like to go in between missions sometimes when I&#13;
have major missions there. I sometimes like to go in between and to get feedback and to&#13;
get agreement on how they would like to proceed in the next steps before addressing it at&#13;
a kind of formal level.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You're dealing with eight countries, two director generals in each country?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yeah, it's a big set. Now, we have not been active in some of the countries. I&#13;
mean, up until very recently we weren't that active in Vietnam or we haven't yet been&#13;
active in Laos. But I'm active in Korea; I'm active in Malaysia; I'm active in the&#13;
Philippines and in Laos. Those are my major ones. In Thailand they've not been willing&#13;
to borrow in the social sectors since the early '80s, but they've been very anxious for us to&#13;
do sector work. So we have had an active relationship around issues, mainly in education&#13;
that we wrote a report last year . . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: These sectors have melded a lot, haven't they, health and education and&#13;
population?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, in the sense that we now define them as a sector and we used to define&#13;
them as different sectors. They are not melded as muchâ&#128;&#148;I mean, at a conceptual level,&#13;
and the Bank has written a paper on human resource strategies and this and that, thereâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
some work going on. And I think it has been helpful to combine health and education&#13;
because the health people say, basically have taken the view that if you don't get the kids&#13;
before they've five, you've basically lost it. And the education people said, "Well, life&#13;
begins in first grade." And somehow there was a total sort of passing of the wind in their&#13;
view of what was an appropriate level of age to focus on intervention, and I think what&#13;
that's all done is it has ledâ&#128;&#148;at least the benefit for me--has been to help the Bank focus&#13;
much more attention on what happens at the pre-school age level, the sort of two to five&#13;
age range, where pre-primary interventions of various kinds can make a big difference in&#13;
terms of educational and health outcomes in the long run.&#13;
&#13;
I mean, you say, "Why should the Bank be getting into pre-schools?" Well, it turns out, I&#13;
think that's a very critical moment in the formation of human resource potential. And if&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
there are problems there and you see a lot of things go together, that the kids from certain&#13;
kinds of households cannot go to primary school or drop out very quickly also are ones&#13;
who are having nutrition and health problems, you find that there is a target group there.&#13;
And the question is can you find mechanisms to reach those groups. And that's brought&#13;
us in some ways very much closer to the work of UNICEF [United Nations International&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Emergency Fund] in some of our thinking about intervention.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Also, I guess, in prenatal care.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: In prenatal care, yeah, exactly, the whole maternal health side of things. And&#13;
I see usâ&#128;&#148;there is a nice integration at family planning, child health, and pre-primary&#13;
preparation for learning which to me is a very major core of effort that we are really only&#13;
now beginning to push on. There's a whole â&#128;&#151;nother set of activities around more on skill&#13;
formation for economic activity, and there you see it at the secondary and post-secondary&#13;
levels and you see it both in the industrializing economies like Korea and Malaysia,&#13;
where we're very active now, and in the Philippines in trying to strengthen science,&#13;
engineering, R &amp; D, manpower creation--a lot of effort at that level of assistance.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What about organizational beneficiaries? Is that a big deal you face in your&#13;
region?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: It's a big deal in my work program, the whole question of NGOs [non-&#13;
governmental organizations] and participation in project design, in health particularly, in&#13;
family planning particularly. We're doing it also in the area of drop-out interventions in&#13;
primary education, the role of NGOs and parental groups. I think it's absolutely essential&#13;
in my sectors to do that. It's not all that important in Korea because we're working at the&#13;
post-graduate level of science and engineering. It's not relevant there. But it is when&#13;
you're trying to reach the kids or reach the poor households. I donâ&#128;&#152;t think--we've been&#13;
most effective where we've found mechanisms to work at the local level, at the&#13;
community level, or to somehow facilitate the government working at the community&#13;
level and getting inputs and working collaboratively with resources at the community&#13;
level.&#13;
&#13;
The real temptation is for the Bank to jump in the middle between the government and&#13;
these various other actors, and it's very important for [inaudible] for me, for the Bank, to&#13;
see itself as supporting the way in which these actors interact in more productive ways&#13;
within a country than the Bank to get itself in the middle of it because then you get tied&#13;
up in knots. So it's a question of how, what role can we play to support and encourage&#13;
these kinds of partnerships to come together rather than sort of making big deals out of&#13;
having NGOs on our teams, although we do do it. I'm not saying we don't do it, but to me&#13;
it's more important to see the nature of collaboration between the government and these&#13;
sort of community organizations than it is for the Bank to be directly involved.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is there something that could be called a community in the population and&#13;
human resource area? Is there a community that includes NGOs and people like&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
UNICEF, other donors, local organizations who--is this something that really exists and&#13;
[both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yes. I'll give you an illustration. In the Philippines when we wrote the sector&#13;
report on family planning, there's a whole delivery system through NGOs that&#13;
complements what the government does in its delivery system through the department&#13;
of health. When we wrote the report, we have a whole set of discussions about the issues&#13;
facing NGOs in carrying out their part in all of this. When we discussed the report, we&#13;
had a meeting just with the council of family planning NGOs on the draft report, got their&#13;
comments on it along with the government's comments, and see them very much as an&#13;
integral part of the whole program effort there. And the government does, too. I mean,&#13;
this is not an area where the Bank has a different perspective than the government. And&#13;
so it's very natural when we are talking and developing our activities in this subject in&#13;
that country to simply include NGOs as part of the problem and part of the solution and&#13;
to try to figure out how whatever we do can support an appropriate role that they can&#13;
play.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is this much of a change in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: In this sector, not really. Even back in our first population project in Korea in&#13;
the mid-'70s, an NGO executed the Korean IPPF [International Planned Parenthood&#13;
Federation] office, executed part of the projects, way back in the mid-1970s. We didn't&#13;
make a big deal out of it. I don't think anybody cared until all of a sudden this whole&#13;
subject became very attractive. But the fact is that in this field I think the Bank has been&#13;
working in this sort of NGO collaboration mode for, almost since the outset.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I was wondering if we could go back a little bit, to the [inaudible] in your&#13;
work there, which I gather was mostly organizational&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yeah, when I joined the Bank in 1974 I joined through the Young&#13;
Professionals program. My first assignment in the YP program was in the personnel&#13;
department where they decided, I think, because I was probably one of the few YPs who&#13;
ever came into the Bank with an undergraduate degree in psychology that that's probably&#13;
the only person that they could fit in the personnel department. So I spent my first six&#13;
months working on the new performance appraisal system that was being created at the&#13;
time, and I then went on to work in operations.&#13;
&#13;
When I left the YP program I opted to take a permanent assignment back in personnel. I&#13;
ended up spending nine years in the personnel department working on the policy side, not&#13;
on the sort of administration side, but on the policy and planning side. I was the Bank's&#13;
manpower planner for a while, and then I was put in charge of the policy unit and then&#13;
later a policy and planning division, managed the first attitude surveys in the whole&#13;
development of the policies of research and personnel planning, orientation. I wrote most&#13;
of the personnel policies that were produced between 1975 and 1983 personally or was&#13;
responsible later on in my division for those, not including compensation because there&#13;
was another policy group on the compensation and benefits, but on the staffing side and&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
on sort of the treatment of people, personnel information, the environment, promotion&#13;
and training, et cetera, that whole set of things, plus the attitude survey, the creation of&#13;
the principles of employment, staff rules, that set of things. I was very deeply involvedâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
all of which was kicked off by the 1972 reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
As I understand it, there was a survey done about a year after the reorganization by&#13;
McKinsey [and Company] which was sort of a check on attitudes, how people were&#13;
reacting to the reorganization. And what they discovered--and this was done by OPD&#13;
[Organization Planning Department] very quietly; it was not something that was&#13;
published--they discovered that there was a lot of unhappiness, that people who had been&#13;
regionalized were feeling disassociated from their professional colleagues, split up into&#13;
different units, smaller units, and with people with other disciplines but not their friends&#13;
who they worked with in the old area departments or project departments where they&#13;
were.&#13;
&#13;
By then [Robert S.] McNamara was on his growth, deep into his growth strategy, and the&#13;
orientation of the personnel function in the late '60s and early '70s was on recruitment and&#13;
benefits. What do you have to do to attract people and get them into the Bank to feed this&#13;
growth strategy? That's where most of the effort was in the personnel department in the&#13;
late '60s and the early '70s--which is fair enough. I mean, if you're going to grow that&#13;
rapidly, that's what you've got to attend to. And they did it quite well--very well, I think--&#13;
but with the reorganization which was meant to set in place a structure that could absorb&#13;
this rapid growth without the structure itself having to come under pressure for a&#13;
significant period of timeâ&#128;&#148;and that was what that reorganization of '72 was all about--&#13;
then the issue became what do you do with all these people once you've got them here,&#13;
and what does the Bank need to do to acquire competencies and systems, procedures and&#13;
policies to handle careers of people, a larger number of people in more boxes who are&#13;
going to need to be, maintain their professional skills, to upgrade them. Will we now&#13;
have to think about reassignment as a normal part of life not as something that you only&#13;
talk about in dark whispers in the corridors? Formalized promotion processes are made&#13;
more transparent, the basis on which those sorts of decisions are made to get some sort of&#13;
organized processes of training in place. What do you do with people who go on external&#13;
service? How do you make judgments about performance? How do you relate pay to&#13;
performance? All those kinds of questions were put on the table about the day that I&#13;
arrived in the Bank. And there was a task force that had been chaired by the current at&#13;
that time vice president of personnel, Bernard Chadenet, which sort of created the agenda&#13;
for developing a personnel function during the 1970s to flesh out these things. But what I&#13;
was hired to do after I left the YP program was to create that infrastructure of policy and&#13;
procedure in this area of Bank management in which there wasn't any infrastructure. It&#13;
was all very ad hoc.&#13;
&#13;
And so I spent almost the first nine years of my life in the Bank essentially creating that&#13;
infrastructure. For better or for ill, we went through lots of processes, lots of&#13;
consultations, wrote a lot of policies, published a lot of things in the personnel manual,&#13;
set up fake job postings, set up reassignment panels, tried to rationalize the way in which&#13;
promotion decisions were made. We did a lot of things of that type, went through a series&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of reorganizations of the personnel function trying to--there was a period where--I guess&#13;
my general feeling was that the personnel function has always been, and maybe&#13;
necessarily so, a step or two behind the forces driving the Bank as an institution,&#13;
struggling to catch up. And it's true now with what's driving the organization. First it was&#13;
to recruit and pay people so that the staffing strategies and growth strategies could be&#13;
maintained. Then it was trying to shift gears toâ&#128;&#148;well, then it was trying to create a policy&#13;
infrastructure so that people had a clearer idea about how decisions that affected them&#13;
were actually made and who had the authority to do what and what information was&#13;
needed to drive all this.&#13;
&#13;
That led us into a major computing system effort in the mid-'70s, something called the&#13;
human resources information system, which I tried to spearhead. Part of my role then&#13;
was working through the politics of the Bank's computing processes to get new system&#13;
specifications and computing capacities on data needed to manage all these new policies&#13;
and procedures and systems and such. So I was very much involved in that effort, too.&#13;
&#13;
But I think, you know, what happened was that this was also a period when the image or&#13;
the self-concept of personnel management was shifting from a kind of personnel&#13;
administration orientation to a human resource management orientation. And the&#13;
difference in the language reflects a very different image of what the personnel function&#13;
is all about and what impact on the organization it should have, moving from just&#13;
basically making sure decisions are documented, that the proper bread-and-butter&#13;
activities are taken care of efficiently so that everyone knows where they stand and that&#13;
everything is legal, you know, et cetera, to a role of trying to--more interventionist in&#13;
terms of interventions that affect growth of people, how people grow and acquire&#13;
competencies over time and whether that is something that is purposeful or just ad hoc.&#13;
And as soon as you accept that there is a role for an institutionally mandated process of&#13;
growing people not just using them, then you're in an entirely different mode.&#13;
&#13;
And the same thing, later on when we got into attitude surveys and somewhat more&#13;
sophisticated efforts in management development and organization development, what&#13;
are the human dynamics involved in organizational change, adaptivity to change, how do&#13;
you deal with technology changes, particularly on the information side, and how it comes&#13;
back into the workplace, and where you see human resource management as managing&#13;
the human side of those kinds of organizational development, which is again a very much&#13;
more sophisticated concept.&#13;
&#13;
Then there is a political side that swept over all this in the late '70s which was around&#13;
compensation, the external feelings about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the&#13;
Bank's general compensation policies. It politicized the Board. It politicized the staff. The&#13;
only time in my whole time in the Bank that I have seen the Bank fracture along&#13;
nationality lines was around the first Kafka [Joint Bank-Fund Committee on Staff&#13;
Compensation Issues] effort, around 1978 or so, when basically everyone went to their&#13;
own ED. There were groups that were lobbying their own Executives Directors in their&#13;
own national interests--the only time in the whole history of the Bank that Iâ&#128;&#152;ve seen the&#13;
staff break that way.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: When?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Around--this is in the late '70s.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But also in the â&#128;&#151;87 reorganization?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Not around nationalities, no.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I thoughtâ&#128;&#148;actually there are a lot of EDs in the memos of their nationalities . .&#13;
.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, the EDs are always oriented that way. The EDs are always to take as&#13;
one of their starting points how well people from their constituency are represented in the&#13;
management of the Bank and in the staff at large in the Bank. That's fine. I mean, that's&#13;
what you would expect the Executive Directors to be interested in and to press for, and&#13;
there's a lot of politics around senior appointments, particularly management&#13;
appointments at the Bank--not at the division chief level so much as directors and&#13;
up where those sorts of considerations are quite powerful but not determining. I mean, I&#13;
think that the Bank management, in my view, has relatively successfully resisted&#13;
pressures from certain nationality groups simply to have someone from that country in a&#13;
very senior position because they're from that country not because they have what it takes&#13;
to do the job or that they would be best for the job. But there is always concern about&#13;
balancing thatâ&#128;&#152;s there, and it's there in the most recent set of decisions that have been&#13;
made this past month. So those are all forces that are at work. But in terms of the staff&#13;
itself in the Bank I really, as I say, I haven't seen--even the 1987 reorganization didn't&#13;
really internally break down along nationality lines. There was a lot of apprehension for&#13;
lots of reasons, but it wasn't driven by that concern.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In a lotâ&#128;&#148;not a lot, but a fair number--of the European staff there was a feeling&#13;
that, at least that's what we heard, that senior Bank who were sort of in the first round&#13;
perhaps being let go, they approached the EDs and they approached Conable that their&#13;
nationalities were being selectively [both speaking at once] and that raised the whole&#13;
golden . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yeah, but I don't think that was . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . handshake much more than it might have been.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yeah, but my experience of the reorganization was that that was very&#13;
marginal, very marginal. It had--there may have been some correlation between the&#13;
elderly group of the Bank. I mean, if you look at the profile of people who were within&#13;
the zone of retirement age, it does have a nationality, a different profile, than the base of&#13;
staff because there's been a very significant shift in the nationality profile of recruiting in&#13;
the 1970s compared to the 1950s and â&#128;&#151;60s. And so the people who were recruited in the&#13;
'50s and '60s who were older and closer to retirement probably did have a different&#13;
&#13;
                                  Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                            October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
nationality profile than the base, but I don't think that's because of any particular concern&#13;
about nationality. It's a concern about the type of skills needed for the future and whether&#13;
these people had what was felt at the time of '87 to be the potential or the skills and the&#13;
knowledge to deal with the issues that the Bank saw itself dealing with in the '80s and the&#13;
'90s. But I see that more as a generational shift reflecting the changes in the issues of&#13;
development, some of the sectoral switching that we've talked about, and some of the&#13;
techniques that developed for--dealers on debt and various types of things that weren't&#13;
part of the basic training of people who were recruited 30 years ago. So I think it had&#13;
more to do with expertise and experience than it had to do with nationalities even though&#13;
some people may have felt differently.&#13;
&#13;
Certainly for those of us who were involved in the selection process when it cascaded&#13;
down, nationality simply wasn't a factor. Picking from within the people who were being&#13;
selected for jobs in the different units when we were picking them.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Is there any way we can chronicle sort of in terms changes in the major&#13;
internal incentives system, I mean, which was induced in one year saying this will have a&#13;
great incentive to bring--or had or whatever--to bring their [inaudible] to the Board so&#13;
that these, you know, at that stage rather than when the project was implemented, and that&#13;
had effect . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I think that's very difficult to document.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I mean, sort of [inaudible] incentive system long term rather than short term&#13;
situation which is endemic in most organizations.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I'm not sure how to answer that. There are lots of--I guess the way I look at&#13;
the Bank's behavior, particularly in the last four or five years, is that it's almost like an&#13;
over determined equation. There is a lot of bean counting. "How are you doing on this?&#13;
How are you doing on that? How are you doing on this? How are you doing on that?"&#13;
And every time that the Bank is looked at through the prism of one of these perspectives,&#13;
you orient your experience and your information to put the best face on that particular&#13;
dimension of the Bank's performance. But the next, a week later, you're in an entirely&#13;
different lens, and somebody is asking, "How are you doing on Board presentations?&#13;
How are you doing on audits? How are you doing on responsiveness to women in&#13;
development? How are you doing on this? How are you doing on that? How are you&#13;
doing on this?" It's an over determined equation. And somehowâ&#128;&#148;thereâ&#128;&#152;s, I mean part of&#13;
the culture of the Bank is somehow all of these concerns are valid, and the Bank should at&#13;
H Level be able to be accountable to all of them all of the time and that tradeoffs aren't&#13;
allowed. Okay? That's implicit in the culture. You can't say you're going to do less with&#13;
women in development in order to do better on audit. It just doesn't work that way.&#13;
&#13;
At my level of the system it all becomes a little contrived. I mean, there is a sort of basic&#13;
reality of the projects you're working on, you know, at whatever stage of the cycle you're&#13;
in, whether it's identification through the last PCR [project completion review] missions.&#13;
And there are features of those projects which you can't change--you can dress up or&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
dress down, but basically thereâ&#128;&#152;s a reality out there. And to a large extent the timing of&#13;
lending is driven by what the borrower is able to do not what we're able to do. I mean, to&#13;
some extent itâ&#128;&#152;s affected whether we can put the team out there fast enough or whatever&#13;
or can find the right consultant. But that's marginal. I mean, most projects go at a pace&#13;
that is their own pace regardless of how much effort, you know, senior management tries&#13;
to make in managing things like Board presentations and numbers of loan approvals and&#13;
the rest of it.&#13;
&#13;
The only way I know how to handle is--at my level of assistance--is essentially to have a&#13;
pipeline thatâ&#128;&#152;s bigger that what has been promised, with enough and what someone once&#13;
called the "double holler" approach. You tell your management that you will deliver this&#13;
on that date when in fact you're telling your clients that you're going to deliver more&#13;
faster and you give yourself rope in the middle to be able to switch. If something goes&#13;
really badly, you can bring something else in and switch it, that you give yourself some&#13;
timing lags so that you can deal with unforeseen issues without having a portfolio&#13;
slippage and that you sort of build that into everybody's expectations. If you don't, then&#13;
you are promising things that almost invariably you can't fulfill because something&#13;
always happens in a country that slows something up or they don't sign a document or&#13;
you get into an issue and it'sâ&#128;&#148;and then itâ&#128;&#152;s--you create the impression of failure to&#13;
deliver that carries with it the sort of aura of not having delivered. The only way I know&#13;
how to manage that is to manage the expectation and not create expectations that you&#13;
don't feel very comfortable that you can live with.&#13;
&#13;
Now, some people do that well and some people do that poorly. Some people feel that&#13;
they have to over promise in order to get the resources to do anything at all, and if you&#13;
don't deliver, at least you've gotten the resources and you're, you know, doing the best&#13;
you can. Other people play it my way. I don't think that there is a standard way of dealing&#13;
with this question about accountability and managing expectations. My feeling is the&#13;
departments that have the reputations for being high performing are ones that are pretty&#13;
good at managing expectations and downplaying things and not over promising.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I'm a bit embarrassed about the time.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: No, no. I'm completely at your disposal.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Really? Thanks a lot. It's really helpful. This is the hardest area for us to get at,&#13;
in terms of organization.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There's one that we could do with some help on also, searching out what to&#13;
look and where. [inaudible] but obviously one can get into especially sort of intra-&#13;
organizational issues of which there are a host of them, not only within the central&#13;
institution here, to an extent, but some of the people perhaps and it makes consultation,&#13;
incentives, the whole nature of accountability, accountability to whom, to the managers,&#13;
to your employees, or to your clients, you know how all that has beenâ&#128;&#148;how the&#13;
institution grappled and changed, evolved, adapted, whatever. And sort of which would&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           22&#13;

&#13;
be, perhaps, over time, if you could maybe point out to me, at least in that period when&#13;
you were involved and maybe later&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I can give you some perspectives on it. There aren't a lot of documents&#13;
around. I mean, there are a lot of Board papers.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. But that's always a different thing.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: But I'll give you some of my own perceptions of it.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: We communicate on procurement matters, for example, back and forth very&#13;
easily and can resolve issues much more quickly than we could in the '70s, and so&#13;
everything sort of happens in a more collapsed timeframe. And itâ&#128;&#152;s true with business&#13;
around the world; itâ&#128;&#152;s not . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Faster and more, I guess, more kinds of nursing of things.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yeah. But the response to technology has not been to diminish the need for&#13;
other resources; it's been to increase the workload. Okay? That's really what's happened&#13;
because the demand for development work or the opportunity for development work, is&#13;
so elastic it's really constrained by the ability to communicate, the amount of time and&#13;
energy that people can put into it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s why I guess at the beginning I asked you about diplomacy. It was&#13;
really a very anecdotal way--it wasnâ&#128;&#152;t a very good way to get at what I was thinking&#13;
about. I didn't want to get into it at the beginning. I'm interested in theâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#152;m just amazed&#13;
by the way it's changing. And I keep wondering how does the Bank manage its personnel&#13;
in like a [inaudible] crude, how does it choose the people for the new world?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Let me give you my--a sort of the broad overview of my views on that and&#13;
talk a little bit about where we are now. I would say that one of--I guess my general&#13;
opinion is that the Bank succeeds because of the quality of the people that have been&#13;
selected to work here and the quality of consultants that by and large have been hired to&#13;
work with the Bank. That quality, I think, is very much a function of good people picking&#13;
good people. I think it has had a lot less to do with formal policy and process and a lot&#13;
more to do with having picked some good people, that they have a habit of picking good&#13;
people and maintaining a certain standard of intellectual ability and, I would say,&#13;
integrity, personal integrity, the personal qualities which I find remarkable in this&#13;
institution compared with most other organization sets that I've been exposed to. And I&#13;
donâ&#128;&#152;t think--to some extent I would say that's not been a conscious outcome. I would say&#13;
that that is something that is a part of the Bank culture, that has an unconscious element&#13;
to it. I think it reflects a very high degree of professional integrity within the institution&#13;
that pretty much permeates the place. You know, you can always find exceptions, but I&#13;
believe that is the core.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now the question is, you know, in terms of the organized personnel function, how has&#13;
that helped or hindered the processes involved and has there been a deterioration in the&#13;
quality of decision making or an improvement over time. I would say--going back to the&#13;
historical line for a minute--that the sort of attention focus of the people who are running&#13;
the personnel department in the late '60s and the early '70s was on the compensation&#13;
package and the recruitment system. And when the personnel department itself was&#13;
created--when the administration department was split; this is around '68, '69â&#128;&#148;and when&#13;
Reg [Reginald A.] Clarke, who had been in the administration department, was asked to&#13;
become the director of personnel. And Reg basically was a financial guy. His background&#13;
wasn't in personnel. His backgroundâ&#128;&#148;heâ&#128;&#152;d had been a World War II ace, a very young,&#13;
successful RAF pilot who went into financial related things and joined the Bank basically&#13;
to do financial things and ended up as the head of personnel to make sure that the&#13;
compensation policies and the benefits policies were adequate to attract good people from&#13;
around the world--particularly from Europe, I think, in the late 1960s--and to begin to&#13;
bring in qualified people from developing countries as the Bank took its development&#13;
mandate more seriously and to put a recruiting system in place that was able to identify&#13;
good quality people in a large number of places. And I think that the emphasis on the&#13;
recruiting effort and going out and finding good people combined with this emphasis on&#13;
getting good, attractive compensation systems was the real centerpiece of the Bank's&#13;
personnel orientation in the late '60s and early '70s, and which was appropriate to the&#13;
strategy of rapid growth. And Reg Clark led that effort.&#13;
&#13;
And at the time Martijn Paijmans was appointed as his deputy. Martijn also came out of&#13;
operations and spent a couple of years and then went back into operations and was&#13;
replaced by a team of John North and Eugenio Lari, also both coming out of operations,&#13;
one of whom was given responsibility for the policy side, which was Eugenio Lari, and&#13;
the other for operational activities, which was John North. And I think it was under John&#13;
North and Eugenio Lari that these task forces took shape and were the beginnings of a&#13;
policy agenda beyond simply gearing up a recruitment system and working on&#13;
compensation policy reforms.&#13;
&#13;
With the development of the Chadenet task force report on staff development, which was&#13;
I think what they called it, which essentially was a catch-all for everything that you do&#13;
with people after you hire them and pay them, ran the gamut from cradle to grave.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: When was that?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: That was around 1972, â&#128;&#151;73. The report finally came out in its final form in&#13;
the fall of '74, I think. And there were a series of task forces that were led by different&#13;
people, looking at training, looking at reassignments, promotions, et cetera. And they&#13;
basically came up with--and the overall report that was a kind of map of topics and&#13;
directions to guide policy process, policy and system development, a major undertaking.&#13;
And it set the whole philosophical frame for the way the personnel department saw itself&#13;
gearing up for the 1970s and the post-growth effort period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
They created a staff development planning division, which Jim [H. J. James] Dyck was&#13;
put in charge of. His first job was to create a performance appraisal system. They hired a&#13;
training specialist. There had been a language training program, but there had been no&#13;
organized professional training or management training. They hired Pierre Casse to be&#13;
the professional trainer and to look after the language training. They hired John&#13;
Waterston as the management trainer, and he had come out of Coverdale, which was a&#13;
British management training outfit that did some early training of Bank managers on&#13;
contract. John was a trainer, and he was credible to the Bank, and his father had been here&#13;
and was a well-regarded staff member who had retired by then. John decided to come and&#13;
leave the consulting business to come in here and develop the management training&#13;
effort. I was recruited as the policy person--this was back around '75, now--to work on all&#13;
this agenda that had been created by these task force reports and to begin cranking out&#13;
personnel policy statements and work up procedures and clarify roles, responsibilities,&#13;
decision authorities, et cetera, around the different areas of personnel management.&#13;
&#13;
Our whole approach during that time was to take a very consultative approach. Youâ&#128;&#152;d&#13;
draft. We had meetings with the Staff Association. We circulated drafts widely around&#13;
the Bank to get comments from department directors and used a very--a process that&#13;
involved large amounts of inputs from all over the Bank in shaping our final policy&#13;
papers which were then taken to McNamara's president's council for approval, but after a&#13;
very involved process. On reflection I think that was an extremely valuable thing to do&#13;
because through the process of writing these policies we were in effect affecting and&#13;
influencing the shaping of the Bank's institutional views of how people should be treated&#13;
on issues of careers and promotions and reassignments and training. And the process of&#13;
consultation and back-and-forth memos, while very time consumingâ&#128;&#148;and my personal&#13;
files are full of all of the correspondence that we had during that period--it was way of,&#13;
there was an institutional dialogue that occurred around these sorts of subjects.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One more small sort of interruption. How interested was McNamara in intra-&#13;
organizational issues of this nature?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: He wasâ&#128;&#148;I would say I am not sure how to answer it. He was interested in&#13;
the sense that he knew that we needed to have it, that the organization needed to equip&#13;
itself with more formal policies and procedures, that an informal system could not serve&#13;
the type of organization that he had put in place. So he supported all of this very strongly&#13;
as a necessary part of institution building, capacity building at the Bank. He wasn't all&#13;
that personally interested in how we did it, whether you promoted this way or that way or&#13;
reassigned this way or that way or the mechanisms. What he was concerned about is that&#13;
there was something put in place.&#13;
&#13;
He was very decisive. I can remember attending a meeting when we had put a lot of&#13;
effort into writing a reflection on career planning and career concepts in the Bank, wrote&#13;
a report which was widely discussed, had written proposing a number of major changes&#13;
in policy and processes, when we introduced job postings for the professional grades for&#13;
the first time, created reassignment panels to facilitate lateral transfers in sectors, adopted&#13;
a different philosophical approach to careers and how they should be approached in the&#13;
&#13;
                                  Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                            October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bank, all of which was, had been through an enormous process. It went up to McNamara&#13;
for discussion with the president's council. I was invited to attend that meeting.&#13;
McNamara walked in, took this piece of paper with all the supporting things with him,&#13;
walked in, dumped it on the table, and said, "I think this is a superb piece of work. I think&#13;
it should be implemented without delay. Is there anybody who has any questions?" You&#13;
know, and that was it! There really wasn't at that level of the Bank real discussion about&#13;
philosophy and approach and mechanisms. There was--our process had done a fair&#13;
amount through the consultative iterations of building up some consensus before it got&#13;
there, but the way that he operated didn't add to that at all. I mean, it was the ex cathedra&#13;
kind of approach on these types of management issues.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Did Burke Knapp at all . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Burke Knapp was totally uninterested. I mean, my favorite Burke Knapp&#13;
story was the case of some very messy termination of a secretary or somebody that was&#13;
just awful, and it was going to lawyers and going to the courts and very, very messy. It&#13;
was being handled by the division at the time that handled support staff cases. And this--&#13;
he was acting because McNamara was away, and this needed his personal attention&#13;
because there was a major legal issue involved. And they sent this documentation up to&#13;
him, needed a decision so they could get on, and he sent back a message saying, through&#13;
his secretary, saying he was busy doing Bank work and didn't have time for this, you&#13;
know. And that was basically the attitude of senior management: "Don't bother me. Solve&#13;
problems. Get them out of the way. Don't bugger us with these sorts of things."&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was [Alden W.] Clausen and [Ernest] Stern--was that duo different from the&#13;
Burke Knapp . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Very different. Let me come to that when we get to that stage of the history.&#13;
&#13;
So we spent, I would say, the last half of the '70s building an infrastructure of policy and&#13;
process, trying to build some consensus around the philosophical underpinnings, and&#13;
through a very iterative, consultative process with a lot of interaction with the staff&#13;
association. And that's the sort of game that we were in until we got blasted by the whole&#13;
compensation issue on Kafka which put the whole staff development effort on hold while&#13;
the Bank at every level, from the EDs all the way through, was traumatized by&#13;
compensation and what was felt as an attack on the institution by the U.S. on the&#13;
appropriateness of this whole compensation/benefits package that had been put in place&#13;
basically in the early '70s to promote the growth strategy.&#13;
&#13;
By the end of the '70s the growth curve was over, and the Bank was flattening out on&#13;
growth. What we began to see from the manpower planning part was that with the decline&#13;
in growth and with low turnover rates--which is another issue we can talk about--we&#13;
found that there were more--the average age and average length of service at the Bank&#13;
was beginning to move up pretty rapidly. It was becoming a much larger, more mature&#13;
organization of people who had been around for a while. And that added pressure. Those&#13;
general organization developments were adding pressure on the staff development side&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
because the more people had been around longer, the more that they felt the need for&#13;
some institutional framework for dealing with life after your first assignment, you know.&#13;
You may have felt that yourself. After four or five years doing, you know, recruited into&#13;
one job, what's next? Well, some people left, like you. Others didn't. The question is what&#13;
were the frameworks for a multi-job, long-term relationship with the Bank over time?&#13;
How did all that work? And that's we were about, creating frameworks and trying to&#13;
build consensus around that during the '70s.&#13;
&#13;
I must say that the issue of reassignment, of all the issues I've ever worked on in the&#13;
Bank, is the one on which there was the least consensus--very heavily weighted opinions&#13;
about how strongly it should be free market, sort of let a market go and let people end up&#13;
where they will over time, versus how centrally-directed the reassignment system should&#13;
be, a kind of Japanese model: "The Bank knows what's good for you, and we want you to&#13;
go here and here," and a managers' job is to take, to be stewards of the institutional assets&#13;
they've been given charge of, but they should take and release the people depending on&#13;
what the Bank says that it should do. And you have these philosophical orientations to&#13;
managing people's careers, and there was absolutely no consensus in the Bank on that&#13;
when we were trying to form a basis for this. And so we ended up taking a kind of&#13;
managed free-market approach, not leaving it entirely open-ended but not being overly&#13;
directive from the center either and distributing responsibilities between line managers,&#13;
individual staff members looking out for their own interests, and the central personnel&#13;
functions. And I think that this dynamic of the interests of the Bank as an institution of&#13;
individual staff about their own lives and careers and about unit managers who are&#13;
basically trying to deliver a work program really set up the tension for the whole system.&#13;
As I look over the years here, I see it's almost like a pendulum that has shifted from one&#13;
toward the other of these reference perspectives as the dominant force behind the&#13;
activities of the personnel function. In the early period it was basically driven by meeting&#13;
individuals' needs, paying them well, giving them money benefits, the whole approach to&#13;
problem-solving and crises which was to have a very "mother-hen" type of approach . . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: . . . and then later on it shifted more toward meeting the institution's needs,&#13;
and there were concerns about people spending too long in one place, the need to avoid,&#13;
with the regional structure, the creation of six different banks, an active promotion of&#13;
transfers across regional boundaries as in the institution's interest in maintaining some&#13;
coherence in the overall long-term interests of the Bank and consistency in ideas of&#13;
development across different geographic areas, et cetera. So there was a shift from sort&#13;
of focusing on the needs of the individual and making him feel good and wanting to join&#13;
the Bank and stay to how do we address some of these institutional needs through our&#13;
policies of promotion, reassignment and the incentives, the signals that get sent through&#13;
the criteria that drive decisions on promotions, the criteria that drive decisions on&#13;
reassignments and on salaries and the reward system, the merit pay system, and what&#13;
infrastructure can be put in place that will create, through those signals and those&#13;
systems, an understanding of the institutional interests and the ability to see whether&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
they're being met in practice. And I think that that was the driving force through the late&#13;
'70s and the early '80s.&#13;
&#13;
And then in the reorganization of '87 the pendulum swung very sharply away from&#13;
individuals and institutional interests to line managers, and the idea being, "Let's sort of&#13;
get central personnel off our backs. Let's realize that individuals are not as important as&#13;
meeting the needs of line managers." So we put the personnel teams, decentralized them,&#13;
basically put a lot of discretionary authority in the hands of units of line management in&#13;
the regional, departmental, and at my level, took away a lot of infrastructure of process&#13;
on things like recruitment and reassignment. A lot of the capacity that was created in the&#13;
late '70s and early '80s was completely dismantled after the reorganization in terms of&#13;
central personnel focuses, because what was driving that--I put the entire (I would sayâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#152;ll use my--I'm biased on this) blame on that--I think it was a major mistake--on Bill&#13;
[William J.] Cosgrove, who was driven by this desire to somehow get central personnel&#13;
power dismantled and distributed to line managers. And that was a driving--Martijn&#13;
Paijmans left over that issue, and when Bill won that political battle that was the driving&#13;
force of what happened to the personnel function during the reorganization and leading&#13;
us now to the stage where for the new president there's a swing back in the other&#13;
direction, towards wanting to reassert institutional interests in the way the personnel&#13;
function is operating and to take away some of the independent authority of unit&#13;
managers to do virtually whatever they want. I think that's an appropriate shift in terms of&#13;
getting the balances right. It's gone too far. The question is how to do it without giving up&#13;
the good things of decentralized management accountability which is the task this task&#13;
force now working has got on its plate.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What task force is that?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: It's headed by Harold Messenger, who established this--I think the very first&#13;
act of Lewis Preston was to establish a task force to come up with a way to strengthen the&#13;
central personnel functions.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yes. In fact, I'm meeting with them tomorrow because they're coming to ask&#13;
me the same kinds of questions you are about mining my experience because they haven't&#13;
got any of this either.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Thereâ&#128;&#152;s been a [inaudible] when one has heard this sort of&#13;
Paijmans/Cosgrove, what I'm not sure is that these sort of battles which occurred around&#13;
the reorganization of the personnel structure and processes, what was the playing field? I&#13;
mean, did they occur within the task forces? Was that the group within which and then&#13;
some people fight it, or it was vis-Ã -vis their relationship with [Barber B.] Conable that&#13;
those battles were won or lost?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I'll give you my opinion. I wasn't on the front line of many of those, so I&#13;
don't have personal direct experience. My impression was it was done not in the task&#13;

&#13;
forces but outside them. On this one it was the fact that Bill managed to get himself&#13;
appointed head of the task force that dealt with the personnel set of things, and once he&#13;
was head of it, it was his thing. Martijn was not part of it. Martijn was part of an old&#13;
management structure that was, in the thinking of the times, being dismantled--which I&#13;
think was a terrible mistake from the institution's point of view. His wife had died, and it&#13;
was a difficult period for him personally. But I must say two people that I admire greatly&#13;
in the Bank are Martijn Paijmans and Reg Clarke, neither of whom I think have been&#13;
given the kind of institutional appreciation for their impact that they deserve. I mean,&#13;
there's been a lot more talk about Ernie Stern and Burke Knapp and people on the&#13;
operational side, but I don't think that there has been an institutional appreciation of what&#13;
Reg Clarke particularly did for this institution during the time that he was in charge of the&#13;
personnel function.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The Bank really doesn't have heroes, does it?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: No. No, it doesn't.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: There are important figures, obviously. You had McNamara . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, what you find is there are loyalties. The whole issue of loyalty in the&#13;
Bank is a very important determinant of a lot of the behavior. You are talking about&#13;
incentives. A lot of the incentives really come from the loyalty relationships. And at one&#13;
stage I wanted to do an analysis of what I called "the comet effect," which was when a&#13;
big person went from here to there, what the trail or the tail of subsequent reassignments&#13;
was as people get pulled along in his orbit.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did you ever do that?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: No, but there is enough anecdotal evidence. You can see it, how that--I can&#13;
see it now happening in what's happened the last three weeks, whose careers are being&#13;
affected by the decisions that Preston has made to put certain people where they've been&#13;
put.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I mean, it was even [inaudible] at this point. There were, I mean, when he&#13;
was at sort of those who were identified with sort of SVPs [senior vice presidents] and&#13;
then those were identified with sort of VPs [vice presidents] when they moved, LAC&#13;
[Latin America and Caribbean Region] was . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Right. When [S. Shahid] Husain went from Asia to LAC you can see over a&#13;
period of years the drift this way. And, you know, when Ernie went from here to there&#13;
you can see a drift.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And when [inaudible] goes back again . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: We'll see what happens with [Wilfried] Thalwitz now as people move into the&#13;
Soviet system. I'd put myself in that category. I mean, I first got to know Gautam [Kaji]&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
when he was assigned to be director of personnel, but when I wanted to leave, he created&#13;
a space for me in the Indonesia division. And then he subsequently picked me to be in&#13;
this job, so Iâ&#128;&#152;m probably seen in the Bank as sort of in Gautam's orbit.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, that's a very helpful way to see the evolution. What you were saying now&#13;
reminds me. We were talking to someone just yesterday who is retired, Ben [Benjamin&#13;
B.] King. He came out with very sharp comments against the decentralization of&#13;
personnel. He was speaking particularly of the fact that he didn't have an independent&#13;
judge element. He couldn't complain, didn't have any recourse.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, there is recourse but it's only to the staff. You know, as a manager you&#13;
don't have much recourse, you see. I mean, I think one of the things that we did do in the&#13;
'70s was create a very good appeals and grievance system. I don't know an organization&#13;
that has as good a structure of handling conflict situations with the staff level as the Bank&#13;
does with the ombudsman, with the appeals committee and with the tribunal. I think the&#13;
Bank has a very good system for managing conflicts when it comes to individual&#13;
relations with staff and the employment relationship.&#13;
&#13;
The issue really has been on the staffing side, reassignment and promotion, external&#13;
relations. And there to some extent it's important to realize that the Bank by the choice of&#13;
its organization structure has made life difficult for itself because if you think of most&#13;
personnel processes, whether it's recruiting, reassignment, training, and professional&#13;
promotion, take those four core things. They're really much more comfortably organized&#13;
functionally than geographically. If you're taking educators, you know, you're recruiting&#13;
an educator to the Bank. You're training an educator. You're promoting him from a Level&#13;
23 to a Level 24 based on something about quality of educational work. You really are&#13;
managing that career in a sectoral context, yet what we have is a regional geographic&#13;
structure of management. And, you know, I sit here. I'm one of five division chiefs. But&#13;
what happens to my educators? They don't go to the other four divisions here. It's not&#13;
really a career option for them to go work in infrastructure or urban or to work in the&#13;
macroeconomic division. When they think about their careers, they think about going to&#13;
work as an educator on China or in Africa or Latin America or in the research group. So&#13;
from the personnel side the Bank has to organize its core processes around functions, not&#13;
around geographical structures, because that's where the real decisions are. Where do the&#13;
criteria come from? Is this guy a 25 or not? That's a decision really within the sector, not&#13;
within the department. Should this person get training? Should this person transfer their&#13;
experience from working in Malaysia to working on Argentina? Those are all sectoral&#13;
issues, not regional ones. And so--and this is the advice I'm giving this committee that's&#13;
coming up--the way to organize the central personnel function is around these sectors of&#13;
the organizational dimensions that the Bank has got, which is this functional one. If we&#13;
had organized functionally--and the Bank was back in 1972â&#128;&#148;then you need to have&#13;
central support on the geographic dimension, but we've chosen to use geography as our&#13;
primary structure. So in my view the greatest value added that the central personnel&#13;
function can provide is to make sure that the second dimension is well attended to and&#13;
that horizontal processes of management, not just the vertical ones, work effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And that, really, that understanding was lost during the reorganization. There was a lot of&#13;
focus, in my view, on improving the vertical management processes, the way decisions&#13;
are made, clearances are given for loans, the authorities at each level of management in&#13;
the hierarchy to know what you can decide and what you can't, et cetera. The&#13;
reorganization did a good job of clearing the wood, thinning the woods, on the vertical&#13;
management side, but it totally messed up the issue of horizontal management processes,&#13;
and they are critical to the success of the personnel function. That's what I hope will be&#13;
redressed now. It's going to take a major task force and some clear thinking to put that&#13;
back in place, but that's really what needs to be done and why the matrix structure that&#13;
the Bank adopted in 1972 really made a very complicated environment for doing&#13;
personnel work because of this interplay of sector and geography, meaning that there are&#13;
a lot of units where redeployment of people has to be managed. It just doesn't happen. It's&#13;
no problem in the legal department because you have a congruence of function and&#13;
structure there, so the legal department can reassign lawyers from division or from&#13;
here to there quite simply, same thing in the loan department, and largely in the finance&#13;
complex where you don't have the geographic complication. As soon as you get into&#13;
operations and PRE, then you have this problem that you require a strong personnel set of&#13;
systems to be able to manage across those boundaries.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Through this history, how has compensation gone? How can we get the record&#13;
on that? How has it evolved?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: That's probably the best documented part of the story because every year the&#13;
Bank's management goes to the Board with a paper that proposes changes in&#13;
compensation for the next year. And because of that active involvement of the Board in&#13;
compensation decisions, when they are not actively involved in any other personnel&#13;
decisions--except the selection of the president--there is a lot more typical staff effort that&#13;
goes into what we say to the Board and discuss with the Board on compensation. So there&#13;
are a whole series of Board papers. If you wanted to get a full rendering, you could get&#13;
each of those Board papers and study it.&#13;
&#13;
It was marked by two major events, one in the late '70s which was called Kafka I and&#13;
then one later on which was Kafka II which was . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Those were â&#128;&#151;84?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, even later than that. It really emerged after the reorganization in its&#13;
final form, where we went back to first principles of trying to come up with a&#13;
compensation system that was based on some rational structure of making decisions&#13;
about how much salary was appropriate to pay people in the Bank and try to depoliticize&#13;
the environment around compensation.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, the real issue in compensation has been this tension between trying to come up&#13;
with a rational, data-based framework for deciding how much people should be paid,&#13;
given the range of different skills that the Bank recruits, given the different countries that&#13;
people were recruiting from where the markets for these skills command very different&#13;
&#13;
                                  Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                            October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
prices. So it is a very complicated subject for the Bank because you're dealing with&#13;
different prices for the same skill in different countries. You're dealing with different&#13;
countries that price things differently because of their general economic development&#13;
status and a lot of pressure from the high-cost countries to make sure that their people&#13;
don't get left out of the Bank because they're priced out of the market, but then a feeling&#13;
that if you pitched the whole system to the highest-priced countries, then somehow you're&#13;
overpaying a large majority of people in relationship to the market prices for their skills&#13;
in other parts of the world. How do you "pitch" the system to the great differentiation that&#13;
exists in the world for what it pays for the same skills? And that's the problem that the&#13;
Bank and the Fund and any other large transnational organization has got to deal with.&#13;
And it becomes very political. So the U.S. will say, "You're overpaying everybody," and&#13;
the Japanese and the Germans will say, "You can't afford to recruit us, but we want to be&#13;
there."&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But hasn't the Bank sort of forced the issue on itself because of its more&#13;
centralized organization structure? When Volkswagen sets up operations in Brazil, they&#13;
don't have all the employees Germans in Brazil. They recruit most of them, Brazilians&#13;
[both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Locally, yeah, I mean, that's true, but if you're going to have a DC-based&#13;
staff, and if they are . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And insist on them being in D.C. rather than in New Delhi or Jakarta or&#13;
wherever . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Right. But then you see what value added are we going to be to putting a big&#13;
staff in New Delhi hired mainly by Indians to do work on India? That isn't bringing the&#13;
value added in the international experience to bear on the development process. So it&#13;
really--if you're in a manufacturing environment, you can see it; but if you're in the kind&#13;
of work that we do, it doesn't make sense. On the margin, yes, you can use more local&#13;
consultants, more local staff in certain areas, but there are real limits to how far you can&#13;
push that without fundamentally changing the mission and, you know, the character of&#13;
the institution.&#13;
&#13;
And I think personally that one of the greatest strengths of the Bank is having people in&#13;
Washington because again it's the horizontal, the informal horizontal networking that cuts&#13;
across all the formal structures and processes of the Bank that really are what make the&#13;
Bank what it is. It's the network groups, the people who sit down together. The family&#13;
planning crowd from all over the Bank knows each other. They care about what they're&#13;
doing. They want to know how the people handling this in Brazil or in Nigeria and what&#13;
we're doing in the Philippines. They will have working bag lunches. They will get&#13;
together informally. They'll go off on a half-day retreatâ&#128;&#148;all kinds of things that happen&#13;
informally without a lot of effort but which glue the place together are extremely&#13;
important for making the Bank what it is, quite separately from the formal processes of&#13;
reassignment and training, the fact that there are enormous informal networking&#13;
relationships that have been reinforced through All-in-One. One of the great, I think,&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
advantages of All-in-One is how it has supported these networks of people around the&#13;
Bank who come together because they're interested in certain things. There's a health&#13;
insurance group. There's a group on vocational training. There's a group on nutrition, you&#13;
know, and these people network with each other. You know, we talked earlier about the&#13;
importance of local processes in development. It's absolutely true in the Bank itself, that&#13;
it's the encouragement of these informal networking, informal contacts among the staff,&#13;
sharing of information, networking on consultants and who's good and who's not--that's&#13;
what makes the Bank work.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But is it because or despite these structures that this happens?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I think it happensâ&#128;&#148;well, I mean any structure will create boundaries, but the&#13;
asset is having people physically in Washington. If you have them sitting out in different&#13;
physical locations, it won't happen. The fact that we can get together for lunch, or&#13;
somebody from PRE can say, "We've got a guy who's just written a report on this issue in&#13;
Thailand, and anybody who's interested, we'll have a working bag lunch over at . . ." The&#13;
weekly bulletin and the electronic mail is full of these kinds of invitations. In my view, at&#13;
the technical level, that's what's really the enormous strength of the Bank, just being able&#13;
to get these people together and generate the learning, transmit the creativity that's&#13;
occurring in one place into people's thinking someplace else.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You were about to say on historical things, the difference between [inaudible]&#13;
McNamara's and Clausenâ&#128;&#152;s of the '80s.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, I think presidents make a big difference at one level and very little&#13;
difference at another level. The difference between McNamara and Clausen was night&#13;
and day. McNamara was very remote, very decisive. He was perceived correctly as being&#13;
involved in lots of micro decisions. On the personnel side he made every promotion&#13;
decision to a structure position at what was called Level M which is now 24 up. He&#13;
personally approved every single promotion to a division chief, the creation of every&#13;
single senior position. I know because I was the guy who coordinated all of that for a&#13;
number of years in what we called the senior position planning review. He made micro&#13;
decisions on grading and on selection himself.&#13;
&#13;
So he did--what McNamara knew is that the two ways that you could control the Bank as&#13;
the president were who you appoint to senior positions and the budget. And he had a&#13;
strong personnel department that played a very strong, particularly at the management&#13;
level, staff role to him. He was the one who made the decisions, but boy, the information&#13;
was there. And he had a very strong budget department in the P&amp;B [Planning and&#13;
Budgeting] . He had personnel and P&amp;B under him and effectively reporting directly to&#13;
him. Reg Clarke reported to McNamara. Georg Gabriel reported to McNamara. They&#13;
were the instruments by which he made the Bank do what he wanted it to do, absolutely&#13;
no question about that.&#13;
&#13;
Clausen--you hear all the stories about not knowing what levers to pull--he never figured&#13;
out that the way you pull the levers is to have a strong personnel and a strong budget&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
department. What he did is he got into teamwork and senior management and all of these&#13;
sorts of things, and he tried to get a top group of people to work as a team. It didn't work.&#13;
And he wasn't willing to use the levers of control that McNamara did through a strong&#13;
personnel and a strong budget director who did his will on a personal basis. He wanted to&#13;
encourage. He came in basically saying, "You guys don't know how to work together as a&#13;
team." So he worked very hard to try to get teamwork [inaudible] He's the one that&#13;
wanted to do an attitude survey. He's the one that tried to introduce sensible management&#13;
behavior into the Bank, the different systems, levels.&#13;
&#13;
And I think you could rightly argue that the system that McNamara created by the end of&#13;
the 1970s was one of what I would characterize as a sort of cylindrical management&#13;
where the division chief director, vice presidents, senior vice presidents, were all&#13;
supposed to know exactly the same thing and report up here. Very little horizontal&#13;
interest, very little differentiation by level about the detail of knowledge you're expected&#13;
to have. Of course, the psychodynamics of that were mind-boggling because everyone&#13;
was expected to have every fact or possible contingent answer on the tip of their tongues&#13;
at any moment in time. Now, that's a very frightening way to exist, and so that created a&#13;
lot of, in my view, unnecessary tension in the Bank at the different levels where a vice&#13;
president was expected to know as much as a division chief. A division chief was&#13;
expected to know as much as the project officer. And so there was a lot of emphasis on&#13;
equipping yourself with the information to be able to respond--which, in my view, was&#13;
very dysfunctional.&#13;
&#13;
What Clausen did is he began to try to break that down and to say, "Look, you know,&#13;
there are different responsibilities at each level of management. You work together as a&#13;
management team, and you delegate, et cetera, et cetera," but it was a very difficult&#13;
environment. It had been conditioned by McNamara's behavior, and people didn't react to&#13;
it. It was very frustrating for Clausen.&#13;
&#13;
Conable came in. Well, by the time Conable came in there, you know, had been a couple&#13;
of attitude surveys, and things were beginning to loosen up a little bit. But Conable came&#13;
in without any real management background, and he came in with a mandate to&#13;
reorganize the Bank. And so that led to entirely different type of apprehension when, you&#13;
know, the Bank was put through that experience.&#13;
&#13;
Now, Preston is taking entirely, I would sayâ&#128;&#148;heâ&#128;&#152;s a very, I think, competent manager.&#13;
And I think that he is going back to really closer to where Clausen was in some ways,&#13;
really expecting lower level managers to do their thing and not come to him unless there&#13;
is a real need to and expecting them to handle the horizontal coordination necessary to do&#13;
the right thing. Now, we'll see how it works. But the grand experiment is whether people&#13;
will respond to this particular style of running the place.&#13;
&#13;
The question is do all those differences--and I think there are quite real differencesâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
make much of a difference at the bottom end of the system, at the division level where&#13;
the work gets done, or is it really only atmospheric in terms of the relationships at the top&#13;
three layers of the Bank. And the answer there is I'm not sure it makes all that much&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
difference. I'll be interested to see whether what we do and what I do and don't do&#13;
changes much as a result of having Preston in charge rather than having Conable in&#13;
charge. My guess is not a lot. But, you know, we'll see.&#13;
&#13;
KAPIR: Just one bit of sort of changing the question slightly. Just looking at the issue of&#13;
management and attention, what sort of--we went through all the PC [presidentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
council] minutes in the years to '91. What amazed me was how much time management&#13;
seems to, you know, [inaudible] people in the Bank seemed to spend on what I would&#13;
have then thought were very mundane issues, travel policies, every six months for the last&#13;
20 years it comes back again and again, you know. And itâ&#128;&#152;s more an issue of asking--I&#13;
was wondering if you think that because there's a finite amount of time in which every&#13;
manager operates worldwide, and if you are discussing X, by definition you can't discuss&#13;
A and B.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I'll give you a very personal view of that. I think it's a function of the fact that&#13;
there's a resident Board. The reason they talk about travel policies is because the Board&#13;
keeps bitching about travel policies not because there is a strategic institutional issue&#13;
around travel policy. I think the existence of a resident Board has a major impact on what&#13;
senior management does and how it spends its time, traditionally, looking back.&#13;
&#13;
There is one school of thought that views--it's not, I would say, recently, but look back in&#13;
the Clausen era--as the sort of senior management being very tactical in its management&#13;
orientation whereas division chiefs, lower management, being very strategic in a kind of&#13;
reversal of what you would consider normal where itâ&#128;&#152;s relative management orientations&#13;
of senior and in line management. We're doing country strategies and trying to&#13;
strategically position the Bank to do this and that and the other thing, and they're up there&#13;
talking about travel policies! And, you know, it seems to be a reversal of orientation,&#13;
which may or may not be a good thing. It's just peculiar.&#13;
&#13;
I think a lot of it has to do with a--to go back--with the existence of a resident Board and&#13;
the fact that the Bank in fact has two concepts of client systems. One client system is the&#13;
Board, and my personal opinion is the Bank's management and staff really are on a&#13;
continuum of how they orient to, what their perception of who their client is, and the&#13;
president and the senior vice presidents orient almost entirely to the Board as a client&#13;
system. They're there. They sit with them every week, respond to their concerns,&#13;
somehow try to represent what the institution is doing and should be doing vis-Ã -vis that&#13;
representation of the client system which is the resident Executive Directors, whereas at&#13;
the division level, the other end of the spectrum, the staff and certainly SOD chiefs like&#13;
me, my primary client orientation is to the secretaries general out there, to my specific&#13;
agencies, the projects I'm working on, the problems that they're having, how I can help or&#13;
hinder the efforts of my clients out there in these agencies, and what the Bank is doing to&#13;
help them in doing what they need to do and what resources I'm mobilizing to help them&#13;
to address their problems and coping with the problems that they're being confronted&#13;
with. Some of them are systemic in the countries. Some of them are their own making.&#13;
Some of them are, you know, whatever sorts. But the staff are really, live in that client&#13;
system. The SOD chiefs pretty much live in that client system.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The fulcrum of all of this, in my view, is the country director who really is probably the&#13;
part of the management system where the balancing of spending time and worry about&#13;
responding to the needs or perceived needs of the Executive Directors is balanced pretty&#13;
evenly with responding to the needs of the client countries that you're responsible for, and&#13;
there the balance is about equal. Above that I think it's tipped in favor of orienting&#13;
primarily to the Board and below that I think it's tipped to orient primarily to the clients&#13;
out there. And there is a tension, then, because of this duality of client orientation that&#13;
exists in the Bank. In the end it all comes back in one loop, of course. But the fact is that&#13;
the people who sit up there focus on different things and care about different things than&#13;
the people who sit out in these agencies do. And they expect different things of the Bank.&#13;
So you're always adjusting to try to figure out whose needs you're trying to respond to.&#13;
And there is a tension between responding to the Board and responding to your own&#13;
clients.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's really an interesting view. I donâ&#128;&#152;t quite understand [inaudible]&#13;
particularly the position of the country director. It seems to [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
Is Paijmans around, do you know?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: He's in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: He's Dutch?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: He's Dutch. [both speaking at once] I haven't seen him. I know that he's&#13;
actively consulting for the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]&#13;
in helping them organize their management system, so I think that's putting a fair amount&#13;
of--taking some time.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: We should talk to Paijmans.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yes, I think that Martijn would be a good person to talk with.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And is Reg Clarke alive?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: No, he died of cancer about two years ago.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is he the one who wrote the book, the novel?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, that was William Clark. He was a PR.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Thatâ&#128;&#152;s right. And Cosgrove? Is he in the Bank still?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: No, he was, after the reorganization, appointed vice president, and then he&#13;
left under very peculiar circumstances. He announced he was going to run for office in&#13;
Canada, and then he was told that he in effect was terminated from the Bank because he&#13;

&#13;
couldn't run for public office in a member country and be a member of the senior&#13;
management of the Bank. He occasionally floats through. Now, he didn't win, and he's&#13;
now doing consulting in Canada but basically has no significant relationship with the&#13;
Bank that I'm aware of.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: He was the only [inaudible] person on that body that I would risk asking that.&#13;
I got a lot of this story from [Robert] Calderisi.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: There was one other thingâ&#128;&#148;you know, I don't want to take up all of your&#13;
time, but there was one other event or defining event.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You don't have to worry about our time. This is terrific help.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: There is one other defining event in the history of the personnel system here&#13;
that is a story that you should have down right, and that was the creation of this&#13;
document, the "Principles of Staff Employment." You see, the Bank--if you look at it&#13;
from a legal point of view, the Bank does not exist in a world of labor laws that define&#13;
requirements of employers vis-Ã -vis their employees. And most national organizations,&#13;
public and private sector, have to operate within an externally imposed system of rights&#13;
and obligations within which then they have certain latitude to modify those for their own&#13;
business interests. The Bank doesn't have that. The Bank is an open-ended employer.&#13;
There are no external references to what is good and bad practice as far as the treatment&#13;
of people that the Bank employs to do its work.&#13;
&#13;
And the legal side of the whole personnel system is a whole story of its own. And it&#13;
started with the recognition that there were some rights that staff had if they were&#13;
employed, that they were to some extent embedded in formal personnel policies because&#13;
that's the written documentation of what the Bank says its intentions and obligations are.&#13;
And that that there are also--there was a whole debate over the notion of acquired rights&#13;
and whether the practice, even if it was not articulated in policy, constituted a right, so if&#13;
you treated people a certain way consistently, whether that then became a right in the&#13;
employment relationship. It was a legal question.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank first began to focus on this set of issues during the mid-1970s when Eugenio&#13;
Lari, who was the assistant director of personnel at the time for policy, took the lead in&#13;
writing up the terms of reference for the appeals committee. The first thing that we did&#13;
was to recognize that certain management decisions staff had a right to question and that&#13;
there should be a process to review that. But that was all still an internal process within&#13;
the management of the Bank, and in effect the appeals committee advises the vice&#13;
president of personnel about whether a decision that a manager made was in good&#13;
keeping with appropriate behavior, but it is still an internal management decision whether&#13;
to accept that advice or not. But that was the first step that the Bank took towards&#13;
recognizing that there were certain boundaries to managerial discretion that should be&#13;
honored in the relationship with employees. That led fairly quickly to the creation of the&#13;
administrative tribunal where in effect the Bank accepted an external framework to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                            October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
evaluate its own behavior in this area and where the decisions of the tribunal would be&#13;
binding on the management of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was the Bank sort of a follower in this with respect to the other agencies in the&#13;
UN system?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: No, I think that the UN system as a whole, and I think OECD, had tribunals&#13;
before the Bank did, but the Bank was ahead of the IMF. And I think when we were&#13;
putting the tribunal together--and I worked on it with the legal department and with Reg&#13;
Clarke--the basic framework for that, we tried to draw lessons from the UN and OECD&#13;
designs before going ahead with the proposed design for the Bank's administrative&#13;
tribunal. It does differ from them in certain material ways. I can't remember offhand what&#13;
they are, but they are--we did go through a very conscious review of that.&#13;
&#13;
And the tribunal system has worked relatively well. But, of course, once it began to&#13;
function, it all of a sudden increased the risk to the institution of mistakes, having&#13;
accepted an external review body and to accept the judgments of those bodies. That led to&#13;
the lawyers basically saying, you know, "You've got to have a more coherent, clear,&#13;
legally defendable structure of policy and procedure in order for the Bank not to find&#13;
itself in trouble."&#13;
&#13;
So that led, in the logic of things, to saying, "Okay, well we need to throw out the&#13;
personnel manual,â&#128;&#150; that thing, and replace it with something called the 'Staff Rules.'" The&#13;
personnel manual was written more from a philosophical "These are the things we intend&#13;
to do and the philosophy of what we're trying to do and why, and here is sort of how it&#13;
works and what the responsibilities are, et cetera."&#13;
&#13;
The legal department said, "That's very fuzzy because if you are laying out statements of&#13;
intent, someone might actually believe that the Bank has an obligation and thereâ&#128;&#152;s a&#13;
difference between wanting to do something and having an objective and actually&#13;
committing yourself as a condition of employment to delivering on it.â&#128;&#150; Like a&#13;
promotion, for example, do staff have a right to promotion or not; even though we want&#13;
to promote people, but do they have a right to it? You get into that kind of discussion.&#13;
&#13;
So in the end basically this led to the feeling that the Bank needed to have a more formal&#13;
structure of rules and regulations around to govern the employment relationship and that&#13;
that had to have some standing with the Board, not just internally. So the way that we&#13;
worked it out was to write something called the â&#128;&#149;Principles of Staff Employment," which&#13;
was adopted by the Board in 1983, which lays out the basic framework of, if you like, the&#13;
rules under which the Bank personnel policies and ways of relating to individuals that it&#13;
enters into an employment relationship with would have to be worked out. So this in&#13;
effect became almost like a constitution for the personnel policies of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And this was supplemented then with staff rules which were much more detailed and go&#13;
into each of the areas of benefits and reassignments and training, et cetera, et cetera, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                            38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
great detail and lay out how things are done and what the criteria are, et cetera, et cetera,&#13;
in great detail which then become the legal framework for what we do.&#13;
&#13;
The staff rules are changeable. I mean, the idea was that the principles would be&#13;
something that would be general enough long term in framework so that they themselves&#13;
would not have to be amended very frequently--although there is a procedure for&#13;
amending--but that the staff rules within the purview of management could be modified&#13;
as circumstances changed, as policies changed, but through a clear process in which&#13;
consultation with the Staff Association became mandated by the principles in terms of a&#13;
check. We spent a long time putting this together, I mean, the Staff Association, the&#13;
management, the lawyers, Board, trying to be comfortable establishing what in effect is&#13;
our overarching labor legislation. This came to a head in '83--just about a year or so&#13;
before I left--and was published. And then this effort to convert personnel policies into&#13;
staff rules and to flesh them out over time, that process is more or less in place now.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Where does the ombudsman fit in?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: The ombudsman is part of the grievance infrastructure. And the ombudsman&#13;
was created after the appeals committee and after the tribunal as the third element in the&#13;
grievance system on the philosophy that while we had a very good formal process of&#13;
grievances and appeals, that a lot of conflicts and a lot of costs could be avoided through&#13;
a facilitating mechanism. And the ombudsman was created as a preventive measure for&#13;
resolving conflicts without having to engage the adversarial quality of the formal&#13;
processes. And I think it's been a very effective program in conflict resolution, and where&#13;
things can't be resolved through the ombudsman or through normal mechanisms, then we&#13;
have the vehicle of the formal mechanisms. But once you opt into the appeals committee&#13;
and the tribunal, then you're into an advocacy posture.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what's happened is that a lot of the subtlety and sophistication got thrown out&#13;
during the Cosgrove era, and a lot of the capacity that was created to deal with these&#13;
things in central personnel either left, like me, you know, or just got dried up. And now I&#13;
think the task that's facing the Bank is to recreate that capacity and make it better and&#13;
figure out what it needs to do for the future. I'll bet you there are people over there who&#13;
probably don't even know that these things exist.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: That's frightening.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. This is kind of a question on the margin of all thisâ&#128;&#148;this brings up; it&#13;
keeps coming back--the question of memory. It's frightening how evanescent it seems to&#13;
be.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Right. And it says a lot about the impact of personality on the institution,&#13;
whether it's big people, like a Burke Knapp or an Ernie Stern, or it's little people like me&#13;
who carry the institutional knowledge of the history of personnel functions.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I mean, it's sort ofâ&#128;&#147;itâ&#128;&#152;s more than only personnel, on a lot of operational issues&#13;
also. Every new person whoâ&#128;&#152;s sort of become in charge . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Does it their own way.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . at least a higher percent of reinventing the wheel. I guess that's one thing&#13;
that one does when one knows history. One sees something and one says, "Well, I've seen&#13;
this before." You got back and you realize you've seen it even before that.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And there isn't that much new as much as there is made out to be in the newest&#13;
one, and yet the sheer amount of effort that seems to go into creating the new one isn't&#13;
worth it. I mean, you don't get that much marginal benefit . . . seem to be as much.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape2, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: The Bank is such a task oriented institution [inaudible] focus on the sort of&#13;
process and housekeeping kinds of things that really is less valued. It's true. People say,&#13;
"I've got a project to do. I've got an issue out there to handle," whether it's a crisis&#13;
situation of a country whose balance of payments is falling apart or whether it's trying to&#13;
get the department of health to actually deliver something to some poor person over&#13;
there. And there's a complexity of taking on that task and trying to make it better that&#13;
dominates, and the sort of maintenance activities of keeping track of institutional history,&#13;
of, you know, maintaining knowledge and being able to know where precedents are and&#13;
being able to relate to them, and getting the information infrastructure to bring that to&#13;
people when they need it, implies a management overhead that the Bank has not invested&#13;
in.&#13;
&#13;
I would sayâ&#128;&#148;you know, there has been a lot of debate over the years about whether we&#13;
are a fat or lean organization. And in my view the Bank is very lean on the management&#13;
side in terms of these management systems--not on the budget but on these sorts of&#13;
things--and I think your earlier question of how do you make judgments about what&#13;
should be done and what shouldn't be done is a good one. The biases are in favor of the&#13;
tasks that respond to real needs for development. That's a bottomless pit, and it isn't a&#13;
way of really allocating resources. You end up controlling allocations of resources by&#13;
controlling the inputs by saying, "I'm not going to give you more positions. I'm not going&#13;
to give you more money. You have to somehow survive with what I've giving you."&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's ironical, isnâ&#128;&#152;t it, about maintenance because the Bank is always castigating&#13;
countries, borrowers, to remember maintenance roles and whatever.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, there are a lot of ironies which you see [inaudible] in general internally.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, I must say that, having been in the business of trying to develop the&#13;
Bank institutionally when I spent all those years in personnel, to go out into an&#13;
operational job where we're in that role, you know, it is sobering how difficult it is to do.&#13;
It's very easy to say and very difficult to do.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, I mean I think one of the biggest ironies of the '87 reorganization was&#13;
the internal conflict that when the institution tried to downgrade [inaudible] staff, which&#13;
seemed to be one of the mandates not the only mandate, and yet the ease with which the&#13;
Bank goes out and tells the public sector side cut down by X percent, where, of course,&#13;
the social security network and golden handshakes are much, much [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, it's the old "I love humanity; it's the people I can't stand" kind of issue.&#13;
You know, when you get down to dealing with individuals as opposed to entities, then&#13;
you engage a whole â&#128;&#151;nother set of dynamics. And I think the psychological and&#13;
emotional side of organizational life in a multicultural setting is something not often&#13;
talked about in the culture of the Bank. People don't talk about emotional things, but&#13;
they're very important. Loyalty is important. Fairness is important. Openness. You know,&#13;
they're thingsâ&#128;&#148;theyâ&#128;&#152;re part of the reality of the institution. Whether you bluster about&#13;
whether people are candid in performance appraisals or not, the fact is it's a human&#13;
system and you makeâ&#128;&#148;and a human organization--you can look, again look at the Bank&#13;
as various lenses as a legal system, as a financial system, as a development agent. It's also&#13;
a human system. It's a collection of people who bring experiences, feelings, values,&#13;
attitudes, all kinds of stuff into a common enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
And the question is--if you look at the Bank from that set of lenses in the informal as well&#13;
as formal ways that people relate to one another and look at it as a series of relationships&#13;
that have to be maintained and managed and handled in ways that have outcomes that are&#13;
valued both for the institution, for the client system, and for the individuals--then the&#13;
question is how do you see the role of the personnel function or its management&#13;
managing these outcomes. You can't ignore the internal outcomes for the participants in&#13;
this system as part of the process, but that requires an appreciation for what those internal&#13;
issues are, in a group or in a one-on-one or in a formal employment relationship. And&#13;
that's where I think things have gotten a little weak because in this pendulum between the&#13;
institution, the individual, and my management, it's been a long time since the Bank&#13;
really focused on individuals and what really is--what individuals need in order to feel&#13;
motivated and hard-working and all the rest of it. I think in general things work pretty&#13;
well if you believe the attitude surveys at the local levels, but the fact is there isn't really&#13;
much institutional thinking going on about how to respond to needs of individuals other&#13;
than through the benefits system.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: How worthwhile do you think it would be for us to go through the historical&#13;
attitude surveys to get a sense of the sort of morale and Ã©lan of . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: I think it's a worthwhile thing. I think if you simply read the institutional&#13;
summary reports of the attitude surveys you'd get a feel for . . .&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                            41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: They're pretty clarifying.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Yes, because we set up a core set of questions that have been traced through&#13;
five of them now, so there is a data set there of comparable stuff. My view is basically&#13;
what the story line is that there were really two objectives to this survey when this&#13;
program was created. One was to give feedback to senior management on what the staff&#13;
think or feel about a set of dimensions of organizational life, and it's quite compelling&#13;
because everybody in the Bank has their opinion of what the staff thinks. But when you&#13;
actually can quantify it and you have a very high participation, you can say, "X percent of&#13;
the staff responded this way on this question." I found that it was compelling data, and&#13;
you'll see the Staff Association and management using attitude survey data to buttress&#13;
their point of view. It would also dispel points of view that are not supported by the&#13;
evidence. So it's one of the few quantitative things around which one can use to sort of&#13;
anchor a perspective about what's relatively in good shape or relatively not in good shape.&#13;
It's been an important and quite potent impact at the senior level in getting feedback.&#13;
&#13;
But the other objective of the survey was to provide a tool for line managers at each level&#13;
to get feedback on their own behavior in their own units to create an incentive and a&#13;
vehicle to focus on what's not working well and what can be improved in their own part&#13;
of the Bank. And that's true at the division level and department level regionally as well&#13;
as the institution as a whole. So the original intent was quite interventionist, to say, "We&#13;
feel that there is a need in the Bank to improve management." One of the ways that you&#13;
create incentive to improve management is to create a reasonably valid source of&#13;
feedback about what staff feel about how they're being managed. There are a lot of--there&#13;
is a whole section of the survey which talks about your manager and your manager's&#13;
manager. We designed it so that every manager gets feedback about himself, not about&#13;
the institution but about me and what my staff think of me and the way things are being&#13;
run in this division. And we required in the early days division chiefs to share that data&#13;
with their staff and to talk about the areas where things could be improved in the life of&#13;
the division--very interventionist strategy on organization development, improving the&#13;
management's effectiveness throughout!&#13;
&#13;
The attitude survey was in many ways quite a dramatic undertaking for the Bank because&#13;
it was interventionist and it was focused on creating incentives and pressure to make real&#13;
improvements--not just sort of badgering people from the sidelines--by giving them data&#13;
and their own data and putting controls on who had access to data. We basically said,&#13;
"Rule of Two: You get it and your boss gets it. That's it." My vice president even now&#13;
doesn't have access to my division results. So the intention was to really give data to&#13;
people and encourage them to use it to problem solve, to adopt an orientation that in any&#13;
unit there are issues and the question is identifying where are the areas where the&#13;
organization, the performance of the group can be strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
In my view, if you look at that part of the survey, there used to be a lot of complaining&#13;
about division chiefs and about effective management at the division level. You find from&#13;
the latest surveys that staff in general are quite happy at the work at the unit level. I think&#13;
there has been very significant improvement in division level management in the Bank in&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the last ten years, partly through the survey program, partly through the management&#13;
training program--which I think has been very good, one of the better things that has been&#13;
done, the executive development program--and partly through the reorganization which&#13;
changed the accountabilities and authorities and allowed division chiefs to do more&#13;
sensibly in their own mandates. A combination of reasons, but I think the survey data&#13;
would show, if you took the first one and the most recent one, that there has been an&#13;
improvement in the perception of the quality of management at the base level.&#13;
&#13;
But there has been an erosion of perception of the quality of management at senior level,&#13;
and a lot of that is tagged with how Clausen and then Conable particularly handled their&#13;
relationships and management of the Board and of the top three layers of the Bank,&#13;
Clausen never really getting a handle around the place and never really convincing them&#13;
to work as a team and to get that part of the thing to work. I went to a series of managing&#13;
committee meetings during those days in my policy work, and they were terrible. It was&#13;
very disillusioning to go up and see the quality of discussion on a personnel policy issue&#13;
at that level of the Bank. You know, you think that people who were very high up and&#13;
very well paid could have good meetings, and they weren't good meetings by and large.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But how much was thisâ&#128;&#148;I mean, the sense that one has in reading theseâ&#128;&#148;not&#13;
that [inaudible] whether itâ&#128;&#152;s a CPP or policy paper, that people are kind of scoring points&#13;
against each other rather than really . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: There was a period when I think that was a part of the culture of the top.&#13;
Now, the question is how far down does that really permeate. My biases--and I admit my&#13;
experience and my biases may not reflect other people's experience--but my&#13;
experience is at the division level that really wasn't operative, again because the client&#13;
orientation was not impressing people up there or at the Board; it was people caring about&#13;
their real clients out in these agencies. You know, if you're the guy who goes around&#13;
walking around the slums and seeing whether the sewer is getting in or not, that's what&#13;
drives you at the staff level, not whether you're getting more brownie points than the guy&#13;
in the division next door. But so at the working level in operations, the outer orientation&#13;
of the staff and of the management at that level, the whole attitude has sort of been to&#13;
keep all of them away. "Don't bugger up what we really are trying to do out there in the&#13;
real world." While there has been a lot of infighting and politicking among people who&#13;
are inner-directed in the institution, which has consumed a lot of energy and attention and&#13;
created a certain amount of bitterness in some elements of the institution about&#13;
institutional life, I think you can put a horizontal or a hierarchical brake on that, sort of&#13;
made it very difficult for these people, more or less left these people alone to go off and&#13;
do their thing.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You mentioned the word â&#128;&#149;cultural,â&#128;&#150; you know, sort of multicultural&#13;
organization, and one sort of [inaudible] maybe one of the most successful multicultural&#13;
organizations. I mean, it's amazing that really to a great extent perhaps nationality&#13;
[inaudible] within the working mid-level--the Board might have gone through it, but in&#13;
the working level it's really managed that very well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: For instance, in its operational work until very recently culture or sort of how&#13;
it affects work is really not part or it has not been part of the Bank's [both speaking at&#13;
once]&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Well, I would distinguish the word "culture" from, let's say, "nationality" or&#13;
"national origin." I donâ&#128;&#152;t think nationality mixes--most people are blind. Blind. I think&#13;
the Bank basically is blind to color, and it's blind more or less to nationality with a few&#13;
exceptions. And multinational teams work. I've got 11 or 12 different nationalities in this&#13;
division alone, and we're not a big division. And it works! You know, just there isn't any&#13;
tension around nationalities or racial lines. It is in some ways one of the most fascinating&#13;
phenomena of the Bank is that the fact that there is not an issue here of any substance.&#13;
&#13;
I find the same thing on the sexual side, that the women professionals integrate very well&#13;
and lead teams and people accept their leadership and they participate. I don't find the&#13;
kind of tension and sexual politics that you see so dominant certainly in the environment&#13;
around this building. All that is irrelevant here for the same reasons that nationality and&#13;
race really aren't that relevant here. It's defining differences between people. Expertise,&#13;
the development of experience, you know, things that affect past competencies, yes. You&#13;
know, mission leaders versus non-mission leaders, people who are organizationally savvy&#13;
versus naive, fine. Those sorts of things you can cut people around, but not these other&#13;
characteristics.&#13;
&#13;
I guess what I was trying to say there is that that's a different thing from culture because I&#13;
find that both individuals bring cultural orientations and there is a Bank culture, which&#13;
may be what we're describing, where people modify their own personal beliefs or&#13;
behaviors to conform to the very powerful Bank culture. I know in my own case, I can&#13;
just--my first two weeks in the Bank, Reg Clarke edited all my Americanisms out of my&#13;
papers. You know, what's a "ballpark figure"? You find that that acculturation happens&#13;
pretty much unconsciously. I don't think it's a conscious process. It's not a managed&#13;
process. I don't think there are very many people who would give you a common&#13;
description of what--maybe a description but certainly not an analysis--of what the Bank&#13;
culture is and why it exists, but it's there.&#13;
&#13;
And I think that the unconscious side--and maybe I'm speaking from my psychological&#13;
background--is a reality because people want to be part of the Bank. It is more than just a&#13;
job, you know. It's a place where you can do good and do well at the same time. People&#13;
are motivated here by the substance of the work, by the development mission, by the&#13;
opportunity to work with very capable colleagues from other parts of the world, and&#13;
people gain enormous satisfiers out of that in terms of their own identity in terms of who&#13;
they believe they are and what their life means in the world. That's not often spoken&#13;
about, but it's very powerful. It's why it's so difficult for some people to leave the Bank,&#13;
to disengage emotionally from their relationship with this institution, and why the Bank&#13;
in some ways needs to be a lot more careful about how it handles people who are retiring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bradley O. Babson&#13;
                           October 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and leaving so that it can manage these disengagements not just as in the formal aspects&#13;
of employment but of the emotional ties.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And for that reason the '87 disengagements were very . . .&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Were very traumatic [both speaking at once] even more traumatic because it&#13;
ignored--basically the design ignored the psychological contract that exists between&#13;
people, individuals, and the Bank. There's a legal contract, and then there's a&#13;
psychological or emotional contract, an expectation of fairness. And people felt that their&#13;
psychological contract of expectation was violated by the way that was set up and&#13;
handled.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you know or [inaudible] weâ&#128;&#152;ve been trying to, I mean one of the structures&#13;
was bad and the other was the process.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: The process basically was Cosgrove's and his, the group of people that he&#13;
assembled to design the process for implementing the reorganization. I was not involved&#13;
so I can't tell you much about it, how it was done, except that they were given a very&#13;
short timeframe to plan and to execute it.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: By whom was that? Was that by Conable?&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: By Conable, I guess, and the Board. Now, they wanted--they took about a&#13;
year to design it, and then they wanted to implement it very rapidly. They designed these&#13;
AB packages and what I call the "sandlot baseball approach" to selection, which is&#13;
everyone stands in a line, somebody appoints the two captains, and the captains go and&#13;
they take turns picking their teams. Somebody doesn't make the team, and they don't&#13;
play. And that's kind of the way it worked. And that brought all of the fears about the&#13;
loyalty relationships to the surface as people felt that their contracts of expectations had&#13;
been violated.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That ignored all history.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: And it was. It was. You know, I was asked to make decisions about people&#13;
that I didn't know.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, you've given us a lot to think about, to digest, stuff to read that weâ&#128;&#152;ll&#13;
chase up some of that, but I'd really like to come back.&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Any time. I'd be delighted.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Maybe we might send you a note after I've gone through the transcript and&#13;
perhaps get your help if you have some of these memos or documents . . .&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BABSON: Maybe. I have a pretty good personal file through the '70s and early '80s. I&#13;
dropped it when I joined this job and I sign too much paper that's not my own, so I don't&#13;
produce anything anymore so it's all in official records. But up through about 1984&#13;
I've got a pretty good paper trail of a lot of this work.&#13;

KAPUR: And itâ&#128;&#152;s with you, or . . .&#13;

BABSON: With me.&#13;
