            Privatization by capitalization - the case
            of Bolivia : a popular participation recipe for cash-starved SOEs
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            While campaigning for the 1993
            presidential election, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada proposed
            the unique Bolivian model of capitalization -- "Plan de
            Todos" (Plan for everyone)--for six large state
            enterprises in key sectors. The enterprises would be offered
            for sale by international tender. The successful bidder
            would pay the agreed price not to the government, but into
            the company itself. The cash would be used for investment in
            the sector. Initially the investor and the government would
            hold equal, 50 percent stakes in the new company. The
            government would immediately give its share in equal parts
            to all adult Bolivians by endowing "pension
            accounts" set up for each adult citizen. A 50 percent
            stake in a company is usually enough to ensure management
            control. However, to avoid any uncertainty and the risk of a
            negative impact on the selling price, the capitalization law
            proposes that a management contract be given to the
            strategic investor for a fixed period of time. After that
            time, the investors would be able to buy shares in open
            markets to increase the shareholding beyond 50 percent.
            Sanchez de Lozada won the election in July 1993. With the
            help of World Bank advisors, he has been working to make
            this capitalization concept a reality. However, it has run
            into many of the thorny issues associated with traditional
            privatization schemes. This Note describes the key
            capitalization issues during the process.
