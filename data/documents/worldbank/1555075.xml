THE TOKYO ROUND AND THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
The first part of this paper updates the material contained in&#13;
the author's "World Trade and the International Economy: Trends, Prospects,&#13;
and Policies" (World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 282), subsequently publi-&#13;
shed in a revised form under the title "The 'New Protectionism' and the&#13;
International Economy," (World Bank Reprint Series No. 70). It is suggest-&#13;
ed that, since early 1978, the trend toward increased protectionism in the&#13;
developed countries on their trade with the developing countries has not&#13;
continued and, in some respects, it has been reversed.&#13;
Tariff reductions undertaken in the framework of the Tokyo Round&#13;
will further lower barriers to trade and benefit the developing countries.&#13;
The adoption by GATT of the statements and declarations formulated by the&#13;
so-called framework group also represents a step in this direction. Finally,&#13;
the application of the Codes on non-tariff barriers, negotiated in the Tokyo&#13;
Round, will'benefit the developing countries through the liberalization of&#13;
administrative regulations on trade as well as through the special and&#13;
differential treatment these countries are to receive under the Codes.&#13;
At the same time, in order to enjoy the benefits provided under&#13;
the Codes on non-tariff barriers, the developing countries will need to sub-&#13;
scribe to them. This is also desirable to ensure the implementation of the&#13;
Codes and to effect future revisions in the interest of the developing&#13;
countries. In turn, the developed countries are exhorted to abide by the&#13;
obligations they have taken under the Codes and to make a concerted effort&#13;
towards the establishment of equitable safeguard procedures.&#13;

THE TOKYO ROUND AND THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
Bela Balassa&#13;
This paper will review the results of the Tokyo Round of Multi-&#13;
lateral Trade Negotiations (MTN) from the point-of-view of the developing&#13;
countries. It will further make recommendations for actions that may be&#13;
taken in order to ensure that the developing countries can fully exploit&#13;
the opportunities the international trade framework provides following the&#13;
completion of the Tokyo Round.&#13;
As an introduction to the discussion, Section I will examine recent&#13;
trends in protectionism in the developed nations as they concern the develop-&#13;
ing countries. This will be followed by an evaluation of tariff reductions&#13;
in the MTN on export products of interest to the developing countries, with&#13;
attention given to the erosion of preferences these countries now receive under&#13;
the Generalized System of Preferences or GSP (Section II). In Section III,&#13;
the implications for the developing countries of the codes on non-tariff&#13;
measures, established in the framework of the MTN, will be reviewed. Finally,&#13;
in Section IV, the texts formulated by the so-called framework group will be&#13;
examined and recommendations will be made for policies that may be applied&#13;
by developing and by developed countries in matters of trade interest to&#13;
the former group of countries.&#13;
I. Recent Trends in Protectionism in the Developed Countries&#13;
In the years following the oil crisis of 1973, protectionist actions&#13;
by the developed countries multiplied. They included various forms of&#13;
non-tariff restrictions, government aids to industry, as well as efforts made&#13;
to establish international cartels. The actions taken until early 1978 were&#13;
reviewed in the author's "The 'New Protectionism' and the International&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
Economy."-/  In the same paper, it was stated that the continuation of&#13;
protectionist trends presents grave dangers for the developing and the develop-&#13;
ed countries alike.&#13;
Since early 1978, however, there have been some favorable signs. Of&#13;
particular importance is the completion of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations&#13;
carried out in the framework of the Tokyo Round. This has followed earlier, rather&#13;
pessimistic, forecasts about the prospective failure of the negotiations that&#13;
had been given wide coverage.-/&#13;
At the same time, fears that too much has been given away by the U.S.&#13;
government to protectionist interests in exchange for their support for the&#13;
MTN-t have'proved to be exaggerated.   To begin with, while the U.S.-Administra-&#13;
tion promised the domestic textile industry to "tighten controls for the&#13;
remaining life" of the Multifiber Arrangement and to hold 1979 textile imports&#13;
at 1978 levels "where necessary to preclude further disruption;' the limitations&#13;
actually imposed on the subsequent use of partially-filled quotas and on quota&#13;
transfers among categories do not appear to have materially affected textile&#13;
imports from the developing countries. Also, the House of Representatives&#13;
has defeated legislation to raise domestic sugar prices,and the quota on&#13;
stainless steel and other specialty steel products has been extended for only&#13;
eight months and has,at the same time, been increased by 24 percent. Finally,&#13;
the removal of a major stumbling block in Congress through the continued&#13;
preferential treatment to small-scale and minority-owned firms in government&#13;

procurement will have limited impact on imports.1'&#13;
Furthermore, since early 1978,kthe United States had made less use&#13;
of non-tariff restrictions that are particularly objectionable from the point-&#13;
of-view of the developing countries. Thus, a review of the measures applied&#13;
has led to the conclusion that "the earlier reliance on OMAs /orderly market-&#13;
ing agreements/ appears to have given way to a preference for the traditional&#13;
remedy of tariff measures. The change constitutes a return to reliance on&#13;
the price system (as opposed to quantitative restrictions under OMAs) and to&#13;
the principle of non-discrimination in commercial policy."-/&#13;
In fact, in the seven affirmative "escape clause" decisions taken by&#13;
President Carter between January 1978 and October 1979,four have entailed&#13;
raising tariffs on a temporary basis and on a degressive scale and but three&#13;
have involved limiting imports in quantitative terms. At the same time, the latter&#13;
decisions have affected developing countries only in the case of quotas on&#13;
clothespins imported from Taiwan and the OMAs on color television sets origina-&#13;
ting in Korea and Taiwan, accounting for less than 1 percent of U.S. imports&#13;
from the two countries.&#13;
In the same period, the President has rejected recommendations for&#13;
escape clause action by the International Trade Commission in six cases, all&#13;
of which would have affected developing country exports. And, after an&#13;

actionsby the ITC has declined from 14 in that year to 12 in 1977, 10 in 1978,&#13;
and 1 in the first three quarters of 1979.1/&#13;
Furthermore, few of the applications for countervailing action&#13;
against developing country exports have been positively acted upon. Thus,&#13;
while the Amalgamated Clothing and Zextile Workers Union initiated counter-&#13;
vailing duty procedures against Argentina, Colombia, India, Korea, the&#13;
Philippines, Taiwan and Uruguay, the Treasury made a positive finding in the&#13;
case of Uruguay only and countervailing duties have subsequently been eliminated&#13;
in the latter case also.-/ More recently, the U.S. Customs Service has revoked&#13;
an earlier finding that certain Mexican textile exports are subsidized by the&#13;
Mexican government,3/ and the U.S. Treasury has rejected a petition by&#13;
Florida growers who alleged that Mexico was selling tomatoes and other produce&#13;
at unfairly low prices.-/ However, a positive finding has been made on the&#13;
existence of subsidies to pig iron in Brazil.-/&#13;

the framework of the Multifiber Arrangement and of the Community's steel pro-&#13;

national authorities has continued, there are indications of an easing on&#13;
the part of the two countries, France and the United Kingdom, where pro-&#13;
tectionist actions had been the most prevalent. In this connection, reference&#13;
may be made to the liberal attitude taken in regard to trade with the&#13;
developing countries in the orientations of the VIIth Plan in France-/&#13;
and to the turn toward liberalism in the United Kingdom following the advent&#13;
of the conservative government of Margaret Thatcher.&#13;
At the same time, the International Monetary Fund has concluded that&#13;
Japan significantly liberalized imports in 1978, involving the elimination of&#13;
import quotas, tariff reductions in advance of the conclusion of the&#13;
Tokyo Round negotiations, as well as the expansion of credit availabilities&#13;
and improvements in credit conditions for imports.-/ The process of liberal-&#13;
ization has continued in 1979, contributing to the rapid expansion of Japanese&#13;
imports from the developing countries, albeit from a relatively low base.-/&#13;
After the proliferation of government aids to industry in the years&#13;
following the oil crisis, changes in the opposite direction have occurred in this&#13;

commodities and of manufactured products, respectively, increased by&#13;

Korea, 26.5 and 43.7 percent from Singapore, and 35.7 and 56.7&#13;
percent from Taiwan. Increases were even larger in the first nine&#13;
months of 1978, for which only data on total imports from the four Far&#13;
Eastern countries are available. The relevant figures are: Hong Kong,&#13;
49.4 percent, Korea, 40.6 percent, Singapore, 53.2 percent; and Taiwan,&#13;
54.9 percent. (The author is indebted to Susan MacKnight of the United&#13;
States-Japan Trade Council for providing.him with the relevant information.)&#13;

regard also. First, in France decisions have been reached to reduce the number&#13;
of workers in its high-cost steel industry and to lower industrial subsidies&#13;
in general./ Subsequently, the Conservative Government of Margaret Thatcher&#13;
has embarked on a programme of denationalization and has announced a cutback&#13;
in regional aids from $1.4 billion by $530 million over a period of three years.2/&#13;
Also, indications.-are that government intervention in industry is on the,&#13;
decline in Japan in conjunction with the increased opening of its economy..&#13;
Finally, apart from shipbuilding, government intervention in industry has not&#13;
been prevalent in the United States.&#13;
As far as the establishment of carteZs is concerned, the refusal&#13;
of the EEC Commission to accept the cartel for synthetic fibers proposed by&#13;
Commissioner Etienne Davignon3/ has implications beyond this industry.   The&#13;
decision has discouraged other industries, such as automobiles, chemicals,&#13;
shoes, zinc, pulp and paper, and hosiery, from proposing the establishment&#13;
of cartels they had reportedly contemplated in the event that the establishment&#13;
of the synthetic fiber cartel had been countenanced.-/ Also, France has-&#13;
ceased to promote its earlier proposals for world-wide "organized trade"&#13;
and efforts made to establish cartels on shipbuilding and steel in the&#13;
framework of the OECD-have not met with success.&#13;

government aids to industry, and attempts at cartellization point to the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
conclusion that, since early 1978, the trend toward increased protectionism&#13;
in the developed countries has not continued further and, in some respects,&#13;
it has even been reversed. These changes have, in turn, contributed to an&#13;
upswing in the exports of manufactured goods from the developing countries&#13;
to the developed countries. While the volume of these exports grew by only&#13;
7-8 percent in 1977,1/ the increase was 15-16 percent in 1978.2/&#13;
Increases were especially pronounced in engineering products,&#13;
where the value of the exports of the developing countries to the developed&#13;
countries rose by 24 percent in 1977 and 37 percent in 1978, corresponding&#13;
to a volume increase of about 15 percent in the first year and 30 percent&#13;
in the second. And, notwithstanding the restrictions applied, the textile&#13;
and clothing exports of the developing countries to the developed countries&#13;
rose by 24 percent in value terms and by 8-9 percent in volume terms in&#13;
1978. This followed a near-stagnation in volume in the previous year,-/&#13;
and compares with increases of 2-3 percent in the consumption of textiles&#13;
and clothing in the developed countries.&#13;
These, relatively favorable, changes should not give rise to&#13;
complacency. To begin with, import restrictions on textiles and clothing,&#13;
steel, and several other products of interest to the developing countries&#13;
remain in effect. Also, while recent events appear to reflect an increased&#13;
understanding of the adverse effects of protectionism, the time-period&#13;
elapsed is too short to speak of a durable reversal of protectionist trends.&#13;
Thus, economic changes, in particular the U.S. recession, as well as&#13;
political developments, will influence actions that may be taken in the&#13;
future, and sectoral interests continue to push for protection.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
At the same time, in years to come, trade policy actions will be&#13;
influenced by the rules established in the framework of the MTN. In the&#13;
following, we will review the results of the Tokyo Round of negotiations&#13;
from the point-of-view of the developing countries, examining actions&#13;
related to tariffs first and the codes on non-tariff measures afterwards.&#13;
II. Tariff Reductions Under the.Tokyo Round&#13;
The United States originally proposed a tariff cut of 60 percent&#13;
on industrial products, whereas the European Common Market put forward a&#13;
harmonization formula that would have cut higher tariffs to a greater&#13;
extent. After protracted negotiations, the Swiss formula has been accepted,&#13;
under which the rate of tariff reduction is calculated as the ratio of&#13;
the old tariff to itself plus 14 percent. This formula provides for less of a&#13;
tariff harmonization than proposed by the Common Market, and it results in&#13;
a smaller average tariff cut than recommended by the United States. Under&#13;
the formula, a 20 percent duty will be reduced by 59 percent, a 10 percent&#13;
duty by 42 percent, and a 5 percent duty by 26 percent.   These tariff cuts&#13;
are extended to developing countries under the most-favored-nation (MFN)&#13;
clause.&#13;
Preliminary estimates show an average tariff reduction on industrial&#13;
products of 38 or 33 percent, depending on whether simple or import-weighted&#13;
averages are calculated. Tariff reductions are smaller on industrial products&#13;
of interest to the developing countries, for which the simple average of&#13;
tariff reductions is 37 percent and their weighted average 26 percent.-&#13;

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, April 1979, pp. 120-22 -- to be cited as&#13;

a downward-bias as low tariffs leading to increased imports have a large&#13;
weight and highly protective tariffs a low weight.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
At the same time, developing countries would experience an erosion&#13;
of preferences for products that receive GSP treatment. According to an&#13;
UNCTAD report,&#13;
"practically all industrial products covered by GSP will be subject&#13;
to MEN tariff cuts and there will be a significant erosion of existing GSP&#13;
margins. And, in contrast to the GSP-covered products, there would be a&#13;
less radical shift in the structure of tariffs affecting the bulk of the&#13;
value of non-GTy-covered imports from the developing countries in the post-&#13;
Tokyo period."- -&#13;
The same UNCTAD Report presented estimates on the effects of&#13;
tariff reductions in the MTN on the industrial exports of the developing&#13;
countries. According to the estimates, the $1.7 billion expansion in these&#13;
exports due to tariff reductions on non-GSP products, or trade creation, would&#13;
be more than offset by the $2.1 billion decline in exports due to the erosion&#13;
of preferences under GSP, representing a decrease in trade diversion in the&#13;
markets of the preference-granting countries vis-a-vis competing developed&#13;
country exporters.2/&#13;
The UNCTAD Report does not give an indication of the methodology&#13;
utilized in arriving at these results. The methodology is described in a&#13;
subsequent study that updated the UNCTAD estimates.-/ It involves utilizing&#13;
estimates of price elasticities of import demand derived in an earlier&#13;

countries, and relating these to the value of imports from competing develop-&#13;
ed countries in the first case and from developing countries in the second.-/&#13;
The authors estimate the decline in exports due to the partial loss of&#13;
preference margins in GSP products at $1.8 billion, and the increase in&#13;
industrial exports due to tariff-reductions on non.-.GSP products at $0.9&#13;
billion, giving rise to a net decline of $0.9 billion in the industrial exports&#13;
of the developing countries to the developed countries.&#13;
The methodology used in arriving at the estimates seriously biases&#13;
the results, however. This is because the decline in the exports of GSP-&#13;
products due to the partial loss of preferences is calculated with respect to&#13;
the exports of the competing developed countries while the new trade created&#13;
is estimated with respect to the exports of the developing countries in non-GSP&#13;

i i&#13;
where M.D denotes the 1976 imports of non-GSP proftctes'from developing&#13;
countries, t1 the pre-Tokyo Round tariff and Ati the reduction in the&#13;
tariff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
products. Under the assumption of identical import demand elasticities and&#13;
calculating with similar percentage rates of preference reduction and tariff&#13;
reduction for GSP-and non-GSP products, respectively, the estimated decline in&#13;
developing country exports of GSP goods exceeds the increase in their non-&#13;
GSP exports since the exports of GSP-products by the competing developed&#13;
countries is much greater than the exports of non-GSP products by the develop-&#13;
ing countries.&#13;
The trouble lies in the authors' failure to follow their own&#13;
approach to its logical conclusion. Thus, they note that "the assumption&#13;
underlying this approach is that the degree of substitutability between&#13;
domestic products and those from all sources of imports (i.e. both developed&#13;
and developing countries) embodied in elasticities for trade creation estimates&#13;
holds as well for the trade diversion estimates. '1/  Now, while in the case of&#13;
GSP products there is substitution against imports from competing suppliers,&#13;
in the case of non-GSP products substitution takes place against domestic&#13;
production in the importing countries. With the latter exceeding the former&#13;
several times, it follows that the expansion of developing country exports in&#13;
non-GSP products in response to tariff reductions in the MTN will much exceed&#13;
the decline in their exports in GSP-products due to reductions in their&#13;
2/&#13;
preference margin.-&#13;
1/ Ibid., p. 5.&#13;
2/ In this connection, note that in the European Common Market extra-area&#13;
imports account for only about 10 percent of the consumption of industrial&#13;
goods and the comparable figures for the United States and Japan are 9&#13;
percent and 6 percent, respectively (United Nations, Commodity Trade&#13;
Statistics and World Bank WorZd Development Report, 1979). Note further&#13;
that, excluding duty-free exports under MFNj,the.bindustrial exports of the&#13;
developing countries to developed countries amounted to $28.9 billion in&#13;
1976, of which $10.4 billion were non-GSP products (GATT Report, p. 123),&#13;
and these proportions have changed at the expense of GSP products follow-&#13;
ing the reclassification effected by the United States in 1979. Also,&#13;
the data do not allow for the application of tariff quotas by the&#13;
European Common Market and Japan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
An additional shortcoming of the estimates is that the authors&#13;
fail to allow for the limitations imposed-on imports from developing countries&#13;
under GSP. In the United States, the imports of a particular product from&#13;
a beneficiary country cannot exceed $35 million or 50 percent of total U.S.&#13;
imports of the product under the so-called "competitive need" formula. In&#13;
turn, in Western Europe and Japan, imports under GSP are limited by tariff&#13;
quotas.&#13;
In estimating the effects of a 50 percent across-the-board tariff&#13;
cut, Baldwin and Murray related imports from both beneficiaries and&#13;
non-beneficiaries to domestic demand and took account of the limitations&#13;
imposed on imports under GSP in the developed countries. According to their&#13;
results, the $32 million decline in the developing countries' 1971 industrial&#13;
exports due to the partial loss of preference margins would be far exceeded&#13;
by increases in exports due to tariff reductions on non-GSP products ($27&#13;
million) and the absence of limitations on the exports of GSP-products&#13;
($106 million), to which increases in the exports oft-developing countries&#13;
that do not enjoy GSP-treatment ($268 million) should be added.!/ At the same&#13;
time, Baldwin and Murray underestimate potential increases in the exports of&#13;
non-GSP products by excluding textiles and shoes from the calculations.&#13;
Using the same methodology, but including textiles and shoes in&#13;
the calculations, Murray has subsequently estimated the effects of the Tokyo&#13;
Round on U.S. imports of industrial goods from Latin America. According to&#13;
1/ Robert F. Baldwin and Tracy Murray, "MFN Tariff Reductions and Developing&#13;
Country Trade Benefits under the GSP,'" Economic Journa1; March 1977,&#13;
pp. 30-46 -- The non-beneficiary developing countries include most Southern&#13;
European countries in the U.S. and EEC scheme, Taiwan in the EEC scheme,&#13;
and, partially, Hong Kong in the Japanese scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
his results, U.S. imports of non-GSP products from Latin American countries&#13;
would rise by $52 million from their 1978 level while the decline in GSP&#13;
exports due to the partial loss of preferential margins would be only $10&#13;
million. The latter figure is smaller than the $24 million fall in GSP&#13;
exports due to the loss of preferences on products that have been reclassi-&#13;
fied from the GSP to the non-GSP category on the basis of the "competitive&#13;
need" -formula in 1979. And',Ithe-expansion of Latin American exports due to the&#13;
reduction of tariffs on these, recently reclassified, products has been&#13;
estimated at $64 million.1/&#13;
These results are supported by Birnberg's estimates of the effects&#13;
of a 60 percent across-the-board tariff undertaken by the developed countries.&#13;
The results show a $866 million increase in the 1974-75 industrial exports of&#13;
the developing countries, even though textiles have been excluded from the&#13;
calculations, as against a $83 million decline in their exports due to the&#13;
partial loss of preferential margins. And, manufactured exports to the&#13;
United Stateshave been estimated to increase by another $111 million as a&#13;
result of the application of tariff reductions to items that have been excluded&#13;
from GSP under the "competitive need" formula. Estimates of export expansion&#13;
for products whose exports under GSP are limited by tariff-quotas have not&#13;
been made for European countries and Japan.2/&#13;

the Annual Meeting of the Eastern Economics Association held in Washington,&#13;
D.C. May 1979.&#13;
2/ Thomas B. Birnberg, "Tariff Reform Options: Economic Effects on Developing&#13;
and Developed Countries" in PoZicy AZternatives for a New InternationaZ&#13;
Economic Order (William R. Cline, ed.), New York, Prager Publications to&#13;
the Overseas Development Council; 1979, pp. 237-39 -- Birnberg has also&#13;
made estimates for agricultural products on the assumption of a 60 percent&#13;
tariff cut. But, tariff reductions on these products have apparently been&#13;
substantially smaller and, in the absence of detailed information, an&#13;
estimate cannot be attempted. It may be added that the developed countries&#13;
granted significant tariff concessions on-tropical beverages and spices but&#13;
not on vegetable oil, sugar, and tobacco.(GATT Report, p. 157).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
We may conclude that the opposition expressed to MFN-type tariff&#13;
reductions on the grounds that the partial loss of preference margins would&#13;
more than offset the increased exports of the developing countries resulting&#13;
from these tariff reductions is mistaken. Under reasonable assumptions, the&#13;
latter will exceed the former several times. Further gains will be obtained&#13;
by reason of the fact that MFN-type tariff- reductions apply to products that&#13;
have lost their GSP status in the United States as well as to products whose&#13;
imports are limited by tariff-quotas in Western Europe and Japan.&#13;
An additional consideration is the fragility of the concessions&#13;
under GSP as evidenced by the substantial shift from the GSP to the non-GSP&#13;
category in the United States and by recent reductions in tariff quotas in&#13;
the European Common Market. By contrast, tariff reductions in the framework&#13;
of the Tokyo Round are "bound" in the sense that tariffs cannot be unilaterally&#13;
raised again under GATT rules. Finally, while developing countries that&#13;
"graduate" will lose GSP status, they will continue to benefit from MFN-type&#13;
tariff reductions undertaken in the framework of the-Tokyo Round.&#13;
III. The Codes on Nontariff Measures&#13;
In the postwar period, trade negotiations conducted in the GATT&#13;
framework concentrated on reductions in tariff barriers.-! With reductions&#13;
in tariff levels, the restrictive effects of existing nontariff barriers&#13;
became increasingly apparent (the usual simile is with the iceberg emerging&#13;
as the sea level recedes). Also, increases in imports resulting from tariff&#13;
reductions gave rise to the application of new nontariff measures in favor of&#13;
some adversely affected industries. Finally, in the years following the oil&#13;

was, however, instrumental in eliminating quantitative import restrictions&#13;
on manufactured goods in Western Europe.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
crisis' the desire to improve the balance of payments and to increase&#13;
employment led to the use of various nontariff measures.-/&#13;
The Tokyo Round represents an effort to limit the use and misuse&#13;
of non-tariff measures and to establish international machinery of conflict&#13;
resolution on their application. This-has been done in the framework of&#13;
codes dealing with subsidies and countervailing measures, customs valuation,&#13;
import licensing, technical barriers to trade, and government procurement.&#13;
The provisions of the individual codes will be discussed in the following,&#13;
with emphasis given to their implications for developing countries.-/&#13;
Code on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures&#13;
Section B of Article XVI of GATT, added in 1955, contains the&#13;
provision that "contracting parties shall cease to grant either directly&#13;
or indirectly any form of subsidies on the export of any product other than&#13;
a primary product." This provision has been subscribed to by the developed&#13;
countries only and it has been honored in its breach as evidenced by the&#13;
number of countervailing actions since taken. Countervailing actions,&#13;
involving the imposition of duties not exceeding the rate of the subsidy,&#13;
may be taken under Article VI of GATT, whenever subsidies "cause or threaten&#13;
material injury to an established domestic industry, or ... retard materially&#13;
the establishment of a domestic industry." Under a grandfather clause in&#13;
1/ Cf. Bela Balassa, "The 'New Protectionism' and the International Economy"&#13;
op. cit., -- In the following, the expression "nontariff measures" will be&#13;
utilized to refer to non-tariff barriers to trade, government aids to&#13;
industry, and administrative measures that affect the conduct of interna-&#13;
tional trade.&#13;
2/ The discussion will not cover the agricultural codes on beef and dairy&#13;
products that--concern few developing countries,- the code on anti-dumping&#13;
that basically aims at securing conformity with the Code on Subsidies&#13;
and Countervailing Measures, and the code on safeguards on which no&#13;
agreement has been reached. The latter will be discussed in Section IV&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
GATT, however, the United States has not applied the injury test;- in&#13;
fact, the imposition of countervailing duties by the Treasury has been&#13;
mandatory once the existence of foreign subsidization had been established.&#13;
The Agreement on Interpretation and Application of Articles VI,&#13;
XVI, and XXIII- of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (for short,&#13;
the Code on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures) reaffirms the ban on&#13;
export subsidies on industrial products, further extending this to mineral&#13;
products. The Annex to the Code also provides an illustrative list of&#13;
export subsidy measures.&#13;
The ban does not apply to domestic subsidies, although the signatories&#13;
are exhorted to attempt avoiding the adverse effects of such subsidies on foreign&#13;
industries. Thus, according to the Code,&#13;
"Signatories recognize that subsidies other than export subsidies are&#13;
widely used as important instruments for the promotion of social and&#13;
economic policy objectives and do not intend to restrict the right of&#13;
signatories to-use such subsidies to achieve these and other important&#13;
policy objectives ... Signatories recognize, however, that subsidies&#13;
other than export subsidies ... may cause or threaten to cause injury&#13;
to a domestic industry of another signatory or serious prejudice to&#13;
the interestsof another signatory or may nullify or impair benefits&#13;
accruing to another signatory under the General Agreement ... Signatories&#13;
shall therefore seek to avoid causing such effects through the use of&#13;
subsidies ..." (Article 11, Paras. 1 and 2).&#13;
The Code further provides for dispute settlement procedures&#13;
concerning the use of export as well as domestic subsidies:&#13;
"Whenever a signatory has reason to believe that an export subsidy is&#13;
being granted or maintained by another signatory in a manner inconsistent&#13;
with the provisions of this Agreement for/ that any subsidy is being&#13;
granted or maintained by another signatory and that such subsidy either&#13;
causes injury to its domestic industry, nullification or impairment of&#13;
benefits accruing to it under the General Agreement, or serious prejudice&#13;
to its interests, such-signatory may requestconsultations with such other&#13;
signatory" (Article 12, Paras. 1 and 3).&#13;
1/ But, in extending the application of countervailing action to products&#13;
that enter duty free, the 1974 Trade Act has introduced an injury test&#13;
in such cases.&#13;
2/ GATT provides for a dispute settlement mechanism under Article XXIII,&#13;
whenever subsidization has the effect of "nullifying and impairing"&#13;
the benefit from tariff reductions accruing to a contracting party,&#13;
but this provision has remained practically unused.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
If a mutually acceptable solution is not reached, the matter may&#13;
be referred to the Committee of Signatories that will make recommendations&#13;
to the parties concerned and, "in the event the recommendations are not&#13;
followed, it may authorize such countermeasures as may be appropriate,&#13;
taking into account the degree and nature of the adverse effects found to&#13;
exist" (Article 13, Para. 4). This authorization is expressed in discretion-&#13;
ary language; thus, the Code does not allow for unilateral retaliation by&#13;
signatories in the event that the Committee has not authorized counter-&#13;
measures. Correspondingly, the use of countermeasures under Section 301&#13;
of the 1974 Trade Act would put the United States in violation of its obliga-&#13;
tion under the Code.i'&#13;
Developing countries are exempted from the obligation to forego the&#13;
use of export subsidies and hence are not subject to any action by reason of&#13;
the granting of export subsidies per se. Nor are developing countries subject&#13;
to countervailing action in the event that their use of subsidies leads to the&#13;
displacement of the exports of another signatory in third-country markets.&#13;
Article 14 of the Code further recognizes that "subsidies are an&#13;
integral part of economic development programmes of developing countries"&#13;
(Para. 1) and states that various measures of government intervention in&#13;
the developing countries, such as government grants, loans, and guarantees,&#13;
"shall not, per se, be considered subsidies" (Para. 7). And while "developing&#13;
country signatories agree that export subsidies on their industrial products&#13;
shall not be used in a manner which causes serious prejudice to the trade&#13;
1/ For such an interpretation, cf. MTN Studies 6, Part 1. A Report prepared&#13;
at the Request of the Committee on Finance, United States Senate, Washing-&#13;
ton, D.C., August, 1979, pp. 195, 212.   -- However, as noted below, export&#13;
subsidies are subject to countervailing action if the injury test is met.&#13;

or production of another signatory" (Para. 3) and "a developing country&#13;
signatory should agree or enter into a commitment to reduce or eliminate&#13;
export subsidies when the use of such export subsidies is inconsistent with&#13;
its competitive needs" (Para. 5), these are hortatory rather than mandatory&#13;
provisions and do not create obligations for developing countries. Finally,&#13;
the provision of Para. 8 that "the Committee shall, upon the request by an&#13;
interested signatory, undertake a review of a specific export subsidy&#13;
practice of a developing country signatory to examine the extent to which&#13;
the practice is in conformity with the obligations of this Agreement" is&#13;
balanced by the provision of Para 9 allowing for "periodic reviews of&#13;
measures maintained or taken by developed country signatories under the&#13;
provisions of this Agreement which affect interest of a developing country&#13;
signatory."&#13;
Developing countries, too, are subject to countervailing action,&#13;
however, if their subsidized exports cause "material injury to a domestic&#13;
industry, threat of material injury to a domestic industry or material&#13;
retardation of the establishment of such an industry" (Article 2, Para. 1,&#13;
footnote 2). At the same time, through the adoption of this provision, the&#13;
United States has agreed to apply an injury test as pre-condition for taking&#13;
countervailing action. Also, in limiting the application of the injury test&#13;
to a "like product" (Article 6, Para. 2), the conditions for the application&#13;
of countervailing duties are more stringent under the Code than under present&#13;
U.S. law applied in the event of the subsidization of products that enter&#13;
duty free.-/&#13;
1/  Cf. MTN Studies 6, Part 1, p. 152.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
From the point-of-view of the developing countries, the principal&#13;
benefit to be obtained from the Code on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures&#13;
is the appl'ication-of the injury-test by the United States, in the absence&#13;
of which producers and labor unions have repeatedly petitioned for counter-&#13;
vailing action in the past. It should be added, however, that the United&#13;
States may refrain from applying the injury test with respect to countries&#13;
that are not signatories to the Code and the latter could not participate&#13;
in the dispute mechanism of the Committee of Signatories.-/&#13;
As noted above, the developing countries also enjoy "special and&#13;
differential" treatment through the codification of their right to grant&#13;
export subsidies, the exclusion of actions against them in the event that&#13;
their subsidies adversely affect the exports of other signatories in third&#13;
country markets, and the exclusion of certain measures they may apply from&#13;
the subsidy category. In turn, the obligations taken by the developing countries&#13;
in exchange for special and differential treatment under the Code remain rather&#13;
vague.&#13;
Finally, developing countries may utilize the Committee procedure&#13;
against developed countries if these provide export subsidies, utilize&#13;
subsidies that are prejudicial to their interests, or take unilateral retalia-&#13;
tory measures. For example, they may request the Committee to consider&#13;
the case of subsidies to shipbuilding by developed countries. The developing&#13;
countries may also air their grievances during the course of the&#13;
annual review of the implementation and operation of the Code. And, as-in&#13;
the case of all other Codes, possibilities are provided for amending the&#13;
1/ On possible challenges to the failure of the United States to apply the&#13;
injury test to the case of a country that is a contracting party in GATT&#13;
but is not a signatory to the Code, see MTN Studies 6 Part 1, pp. 220-23.&#13;

- 20 -&#13;
Code "having regard, inter aZia, to the experience gained in its implementation"&#13;
(Article 19, Para. 7).&#13;
Code on Customs Valuation&#13;
As stated in its preamble, the Agreement on Implementation of&#13;
Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the Code on Customs&#13;
Valuation) reflects the recognition of "the need for a fair, uniform, and&#13;
neutral system for the valuation of goods for customs purposes that precludes&#13;
the use of arbitrary or fictitious customs values." According to a Congres-&#13;
sional document, it "was prompted, in large part, by longstanding complaints&#13;
about U.S. valuation practices and by the desire to establish an international&#13;
valuation system which would be used by all of the world's major trading&#13;
countries."-/&#13;
The Code provides a primary valuation standard based on the trans-&#13;
action value of imported goods and several alternative standards that are&#13;
resorted to in a prescribed order whenever customs value cannot be determined&#13;
under the higher ranking standard. The application of these standards will&#13;
affect the valuation of about one-fifth of United States imports, including&#13;
items, such as benzenoid chemicals, rubber and plastic shoes, and wool knit&#13;
gloves, the customs- valuation of which is presently based on the American Selling&#13;
Price (ASP), as-well as items on the so-called Final List, among which ball&#13;
and roller bearings and certain pneumatic tires are said to be valued&#13;
materially higher for customs purposes than transaction value.- The applica-&#13;
tion of the Code will also represent a substantial reduction of Canadian and&#13;
New Zealand tariffs that use a different valuation standard. It will, however,&#13;

2/ Ibid., p. 21.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
make.little difference for tariffs levied by the EEC and by other countries&#13;
applying the Brussels Definition of Value (BDV).&#13;
At the same time, the application of the new standards will have&#13;
beneficial effects overall by ensuring consistency, transparency, and simplicity&#13;
in the valuation of imports. It will also permit avoiding abuses that have&#13;
involved arbitrarily raising customs values by national authorities in the past.&#13;
In order to ensure that national practices conform to the Code, a&#13;
Committee on Customs Valuation,assisted by a Technical Committee on Customs&#13;
Valuation, is established to handle disputes. The Committee may authorize&#13;
adversely affected parties to suspend the application of the Code to parties&#13;
that have not ceased to follow action contrary to the Code. Provisions have&#13;
further been made for an annual review of-the implementation and operation of the&#13;
Code.&#13;
For the reasons noted, the application of the Code by the developed&#13;
countries will benefit the developing countries. At the same time, these&#13;
countries are to receive technical assistance in implementing the Code; they&#13;
may postpone implementation for five years; and they may delay the application of&#13;
the provisions pertaining to trade between related parties for another three&#13;
years.&#13;
Developing countries do not consider the delays provided in the.,&#13;
proposed Code sufficiently long and have submitted an alternative text, pro-&#13;
posing a ten-year extension instead. The alternative text also gives greater&#13;
latitude to national customs authorities to value transactions by related&#13;
parties (mainly transactions between multinational corporations and their&#13;
subsidiaries).&#13;
Code on Import Licensing&#13;
Recognizing that "the inappropriate use of import licensing procedures&#13;
may impede the flow of international trade," the stated aim of the Agreement on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Import Licensing Procedures is."to simplify, and bring transparency ,to,&#13;
the administrative procedures and practices used in international trade, and&#13;
to ensure the-Tfair and equitable application and administration of such&#13;
procedures and-practices." The Code requires that "the rules for import&#13;
licensing procedures shall be neutral in application and administered in a&#13;
fair and equitable manner" (Article 3). It also calls for transparency and&#13;
simplicity in regard to import licensing procedures and for the avoidance&#13;
of practices used by some countries, where licenses are refused because of&#13;
minor documentation errors or minor variations in value or quantity whether&#13;
automatic or non-automatic. The Code does not, however, affect the existence&#13;
of import licensing.&#13;
Automatic licensing (i.e. import licensing where approval of applica-&#13;
tion is freely granted) "shall not be administered in a manner so as to have&#13;
restricting effects on imports subject to automatic licensing," and "any&#13;
person, firm or institution which fulfils the legal requirements of the&#13;
importing country ... shall be equally eligible to apply for and to obtain.&#13;
import licenses," which "shall be approved immediately upon receipt, to the&#13;
extent administratively feasible, but within a maximum of ten working days"&#13;
(Article 13).&#13;
The Code-further calls for transparency and simplicity in the&#13;
administration of non-automatic import licenses and for their equitable&#13;
distribution. In the allocation of these licenses "special consideration&#13;
should be given to those importers importing products originating in developing&#13;
countries and, in particular, the least developed countries" (Para. 141).&#13;
Developing countries will also benefit from the simplification and greater&#13;
domestic transparency of procedures applied in the administration of import&#13;
licenses that has been used to protective effect by European countries and&#13;
Japan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
The developing countries may make use of the dispute settlement&#13;
mechanism operated by the Committee of Signatories to ensure that they&#13;
receive special consideration in.-the allocation of non-automatic import&#13;
licenses to developed countries. They may also attempt to bring under the&#13;
Code the so-called "voluntary export restraints" that generally require export&#13;
licenses or visas as the condition of importation.-/&#13;
In the event that the Committee's recommendations are not followed,&#13;
it may authorize the suspension of obligations under the Code or the adversely&#13;
affected parties may resort to Article XXIII of GATT. Finally, the Committee&#13;
will review as necessary, but at least once every two years, the implementation&#13;
and the operation of the Code.&#13;
Code on Technical Barriers to Trade&#13;
According to Professor Baldwin, "the customs valuation and import&#13;
licensing problems faced by exporters and importers are often child's play&#13;
when compared with those arising from the many product standards with which&#13;
these traders must contend."-/  In fact, there is a bewildering array of&#13;
technical regulations and standards;and governments have recently added new&#13;
standards concerning energy efficiency and the environment to the traditional&#13;
health, sanitary, and product-safety standards.&#13;
Technical regulations and standards, as well as procedures pertaining&#13;
to testing and codification, constitute barriers to international trade&#13;
1./ Ibid., pp. 303, 307.&#13;

op. cit., p;. 18.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
in the event that they are used with a protectionist intent as well as in&#13;
cases when the cost of compliance is greater for imported than for domestical-&#13;
ly produced goods. The cost of compliance is particularly burdensome for&#13;
developing countries, given their more limited information-gathering, engineering,&#13;
and marketing capabilities.-/ Now, to the extent that this cost does not&#13;
increase proportionally with volume, developing countries with smaller export&#13;
volumes will bear a greater burden.&#13;
According to its Preamble, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to&#13;
Trade aims "to ensure that technical regulations and standards, including&#13;
packaging, marking, and labelling requirements, and methods for certifying&#13;
conformity with technical regulations and standards do not create unnecessary&#13;
obstacles to international trade." For this purpose, the Code calls on&#13;
the. signatories to .adopt existing international technical regulations and&#13;
standards and to contribute to the development of such regulations and stand-&#13;
ards. In the absence of international regulations and standards, the&#13;
signatories should frame their national regulations and standards in terms of&#13;
performance rather than design or descriptive characteristics that had been&#13;
used to protective effect and to provide information on these standards and&#13;
regulations to interested parties. Furthermore, imported products&#13;
should be accepted for testing under conditions not less favorable than&#13;
domestic products and certification systems should not be formulated or applied&#13;
with a view to creating obstacles to international trade. In all these regards,&#13;
national governments should ensure compliance by local government and non-&#13;
governmental bodies as well.&#13;
The Code makes exceptions for developing countries that "should not be&#13;

expected to use international standards as a basis for their technical&#13;
regulations or standards, including test methods, which are not&#13;
appropriate"to-their development, financial and trade needs" (Article 12,&#13;
Para. 4). "It is further recognized that the special development and&#13;
trade needs of developing countries, as well as their stage of technological&#13;
development, may hinder their ability to discharge fully their obligations&#13;
under this Agreement" (Article 12, Para. 8). Correspondingly, these countries&#13;
may receive "specified, time-limited exceptions in whole or in part from&#13;
obligations under this Agreement" (Thid). Finally, the developed countries&#13;
should "provide technical assistance to developing countries to ensure that&#13;
the preparation and application of technical regulations, standards, test&#13;
methods, and certification systems do not create unnecessary obstacles to&#13;
the expansion and diversification of exports from developing countries"&#13;
(Article 12, Para. 7).&#13;
The application of the Code on Technical Barriers to Trade by the&#13;
developed countries will provide benefits to the developing countries, the&#13;
exports of which have been adversely affected by the existence of such&#13;
barriers. Apart from increased information and technical assistance they are&#13;
to receive under the Code, the developing countries are to benefit through the&#13;
introduction of rules.that aim at avoiding the use of technical regulations,&#13;
standards, test methods, and certification system to protective effect. At&#13;
the same time, they may use the grievance procedure under the Code, involving&#13;
resort to Article XXIII of GATT, in order to ensure that its provisions are&#13;
applied in practice. Finally, in subscribing to the Code, developing countries&#13;
would take part in the annual reviews of its operation and implementation, in&#13;
the periodical reviews of the special and differential treatment they are to&#13;
receive under the Code, as well as in the tri-annual reviews that permit&#13;

adjusting the rights and obligations "where necessary to ensure mutual economic&#13;
advantage and balance of rights and obligations" (Article 15, Para. 8).&#13;
Code on Government Procurement&#13;
Government procurement -- the purchase of goods and services by&#13;
governmental entities for their own consumption -- is expressly excluded&#13;
from the application of GATT rules, under which foreign suppliers receive&#13;
national and nondiscriminatory treatment. With the rising share of govern-&#13;
mental expenditure in GNP and the important role of publicly-owned trans-&#13;
portation and communication facilities and utilities in most countries,&#13;
this exception to GATT rules has increasingly become a limiting factor in&#13;
international trade.&#13;
The United States discriminates against foreign suppliers under the&#13;
Buy American Act that presently provides a 6 percent price advantage to&#13;
domestic suppliers (12 percent to suppliers in depressed areas) while the&#13;
Defense Department gives U.S. producers a 50 percent preference. In turn,&#13;
other developed countries tend to rely on administrative action to favor&#13;
domestic over foreign suppliers and may even limit tenders to domestic firms.&#13;
The Agreement on Government Procurement aims at liberalizing formal&#13;
as well as informal methods of government procurement. Its Preamble states&#13;
that "laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding government&#13;
procurement should not be /applied/ so as to afford protection to&#13;
domestic products or suppliers and should not discriminate among foreign&#13;
products or suppliers.''i/ These objectives are to be served by providing&#13;
national treatment and applying the MFN clause to foreign suppliers of products&#13;
purchased by governmental entities subject to the Code above a limit of&#13;
SDR 150,000 (approximately US$200,000).&#13;
1/ The Code covers services only to the extent that these are involved in&#13;
the purchase of products -- The list of governmental entities subject to&#13;
the Code is provided in an annex appended to it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
The Code calls upon the signatories to state technical specifica-&#13;
tions in terms of performance rather than design, to use international&#13;
standards whenever available, and to provide for open tendering procedures.&#13;
It provides detailed rules of how tenders should be invited and how choice&#13;
among bidders should be made. Furthermore, information requirements are&#13;
specified, with the aim of ensuring the transparency of the process of public&#13;
procurement.&#13;
The Code sets up machinery for consultation and for the resolution&#13;
of disputes on government procurement. Whenever a mutually satisfactory&#13;
solution is not reached, the Committee of Signatories will make recommendations&#13;
for actions to be taken. If the Committee's recommendations are not accepted,&#13;
it may authorize retaliation by the adversely affected party. The Code also&#13;
provides for the annual review of its implementation and operation as well as&#13;
for a tri-annual review "with a view to broadening and improving the Agreement&#13;
on the basis of mutual reciprocity having regard to the provisions ... relating&#13;
to developing countries." (Part IX, Article 6(b)).&#13;
The provisions in question aim to "facilitate increased imports&#13;
from developing countries, bearing in mind the special problems of the&#13;
least developed countries and those at low stagesof economic development"&#13;
(Part III, Article 3). Under the application of MFN rules, this does not&#13;
however entail granting preferential margins, unless the commodities in question&#13;
are GSP-products. Rather, it involves providing technical assistance and&#13;
setting up information centers "to respond to reasonable requests from develop-&#13;
ing country parties for information relating to, inter aZia, laws, regulations,&#13;
procedures and practices regarding government procurement ..." (Article 10).&#13;
These provisions also apply to suppliers in least-developed countries that are not&#13;
signatories of the Code.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
The Code further limits the obligations taken by developing countries.&#13;
These countries may negotiate exclusions from the rule on national treatment&#13;
with respect to particular governmental entities or products and may request&#13;
the Committee to grant such exclusions once the Code comes into effect.&#13;
IV. Policy Actions by Developing and-by Developed Countries&#13;
The Codes on Non-tariff Measures and the Developing Countries&#13;
The Codes on non-tariff measures establish rules for permissible and&#13;
nonpermissible behavior, determine information requirements for ensuring the&#13;
transparency of the regulations applied, and provide for dispute settlement&#13;
and surveillance procedures. They also call for periodical, mostly annual,&#13;
reviews of the implementation and the.operation of the Codes.   Furthermore,&#13;
the Codes on Technical Barriers to Trade and on Government Procurement&#13;
envisage holding tri-annual reviews with the aim of effecting modifications&#13;
in the Codes. And, every Code contains a provision for possible future&#13;
amendments, "having regard, inter alia, to the experience gained in its&#13;
implementation."&#13;
The dispute settlement and surveillance procedures have the&#13;
function of avoiding violations and assuring the application of the Codes.&#13;
While the dispute settlement mechanism was not working well in GATT, the&#13;
establishment of a Committee of Signatories for each of the Codes, and the&#13;
care taken in defining the procedures to be applied, provide possibilities for&#13;
its efficient operation in the future. In this regard, the agreement reached by&#13;
the United States and the Common Market to settle their dispute on the alleged&#13;
subsidization of synthetic fibers by the United States in the framework of GATT&#13;
is a favorable sign.1/&#13;
1/ New York Times, November 21, 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
The developing countries may importantly contribute to the success-&#13;
ful operation of the Codes in general, and the policing of the actions taken&#13;
by the developed countries in particular, by participating in the dispute&#13;
settlement and surveillance procedures. Such participation, in turn, pre-&#13;
supposes that developing countries subscribe to the Codes. This is also a&#13;
pre-condition for participation in the periodical reviews that provide a forum&#13;
to examine the practical implementation of the Codes and, in the cases indicated,&#13;
to effect revisions. And, subscribing to the Codes will allow the developing&#13;
countries to invoke the provisions for future amendments of the Codes.&#13;
Participation in dispute settlement procedures and in the review&#13;
of the operation of the Codes is of interest.to the developing countries even&#13;
in cabses such as the Code on Custom Valuation, where the benefits by-and-large&#13;
accrue to participants and non-participants alike. At the same time, in most&#13;
instances, the benefits of the Codes are restricted to the signatories. Sub-&#13;
scribing to the Codes is also a pre-condition for enjoying the special and&#13;
differential treatment available to developing countries, the only exception&#13;
being the Code on Government Procurement which includes the least developed&#13;
countries among its beneficiaries even if they do not subscribe to the Code.&#13;
Among the individual Codes, the Code on Subsidies and Countervailing&#13;
Measures is of particular interest to the developing countries. This is not&#13;
only because they are excepted from particular obligations but also because&#13;
the United States government interprets the Code so-that the material injury&#13;
clause applies solely to countries that subscribe to it. And, the developing&#13;
countries may utilize the Committee procedure to bring up the question of&#13;
subsidies to shipbuilding, and of industrial subsidies more generally, by&#13;
developed country governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Developing signatories may further utilize the procedures established&#13;
under the Code on Import Licensing to initiate action in the so-called volun-&#13;
tary export restraint cases. At the same time, developing country signatories&#13;
can exert pressure on the developed countries to ensure that they do not use&#13;
technical regulations and standards to protective effect and provide inform-&#13;
ation on their application. Finally, while the provisions of the Code on Govern-&#13;
ment Procurement extend to non-signatory least-develped countries, it is the&#13;
industrializing developing countries that have the best chance to benefit&#13;
from the Code.&#13;
The Framework Group&#13;
It appears, then, that the benefits derived from the general&#13;
provisions of the Codes, from special and differential treatment, and from&#13;
participation in dispute settlement and surveillance procedures point to the&#13;
desirability for the developing countries to subscribe to the Codes on&#13;
non-tariff measures. This conclusion is strengthened if we consider that&#13;
participation will make it possible for the developing countries to contribute&#13;
to shaping the Codes in the process of their practical application and&#13;
modifying them through future revisions and amendments.&#13;
Similar considerations apply to the statements and declarations&#13;
formulated by the so-called framework group. These statements and declarations,&#13;
drafted at the behest of Brazil,"Y establish a legal basis for providing&#13;
preferential treatment to developing countries and specifically deal with&#13;
trade measures taken for balance-of-payment purposes and with safeguard&#13;
actions for development purposes.-&#13;
1/ Cf. George Alvares Maciel, "Brazil's Proposals for the Reform of the GATT&#13;
System" The World Economy, January 1979, pp. 163-76.&#13;
2/ The following discussion will not cover the proposed Understanding Regarding&#13;
Export Restrictions and Charges on which no agreement has been reached.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
To begin with, the so-called "enabling clause" in the statement on&#13;
Differential and More Favorable Treatment; Reciprocity and Fuller Participation&#13;
of Developing Countries provides a legal basis for "differential and more favorable&#13;
treatment" of developing countries. Apart from special and differential treat-&#13;
ment in the framework of the Codes on nontariff measures, this clause pertains&#13;
to tariff preferences granted by developed countries, preferential arrangements&#13;
among developing countries, and the special treatment of the least developed&#13;
countries.&#13;
The "particular situation and problems" (Para. 6) of the least develop-&#13;
ed countries are also recognized in the statement as is the lack of applic-&#13;
ability of the'principle of reciprocity to relationships between developed&#13;
and developing countries. Thus,&#13;
"The developed countries do not expect reciprocity for commitments&#13;
made by them in trade negotiations to reduce or remove tariff and&#13;
other barriers to the trade of developing countries ... Developed&#13;
contracting parties shall therefore not seek, neither shall less-&#13;
developed contracting parties be required to make, concessions that&#13;
are inconsistent with the latter's development, financial, and trade&#13;
needs" (Para. 5).&#13;
Developing countries are to receive special and differential treat-&#13;
ment under the declaration on Trade Measures Taken for Balance-of-&#13;
Payment Purposes, too. In applying such measures, a developed country&#13;
signatory should "take into account the export interestsof the less-developed&#13;
contracting parties and may exempt from its measures products of export interest&#13;
to those contracting parties" (Para. 2). Furthermore, in the course of its consulta-&#13;
tions, the Committee on Balance-of-Payments Restrictions should "give parti-&#13;
cular attention to the possibilities for alleviating and correcting the&#13;
balance-of-payments problem" (Para. 12) of developing countries through&#13;
measures taken by other (in practice, developed) countries to facilitate the&#13;
expansion of export earnings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
In turn, the declaration on Safeguard Actions for Development&#13;
Purposes extends the scope of application of such actions by the developing&#13;
countries -- previously limited to the establishment of particular industries&#13;
-- to "the development of new or the modification or extension of existing&#13;
production structures with a view to achieving fuller and more efficient use&#13;
of resources in accordance with the priorities of their economic development"&#13;
(Para. 1). "Difficulties in the application of ... programmes and policies of&#13;
economic development" (Para. 2) also represent possible grounds for the develop-&#13;
ing countries to take actions that conflict with the obligations they have&#13;
assumed in GATT.&#13;
The "Graduation" Clause&#13;
The statements and declarations drafted by the framework group&#13;
recognize the need for developing countries to receive special and differen-&#13;
tiated treatment and provide a legal basis for such treatment. At the same&#13;
time, the relevant provisions remain rather vague and their practical applica-&#13;
tion will importantly depend on the effectiveness of the procedures for&#13;
consultation and dispute settlement.&#13;
According to the Understanding Regarding Notification, Consultation,&#13;
Dispute Settlement and Surveillance, "contracting parties reaffirm their&#13;
resolve to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of consultative&#13;
procedures." It is further stated that "during consultations, contracting&#13;
parties should give special attention to the particular problems and&#13;
interests of less-developed contracting parties." Developing countries may&#13;
also request the intervention of the Director-General of GATT in the event&#13;
that a complaint they have brought against a developed country has not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
been otherwise resolved. Finally, the statement on Differential and More&#13;
Favorable Treatment; Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing&#13;
Countries envisages a "review of the operation of these provisions, bearing&#13;
in mind the need for individual and just efforts by contracting parties to&#13;
meet the development needs of developing countries and the objectives of&#13;
the General Agreement" (Para. 9).&#13;
At the same time, questions have been raised concerning the "principle&#13;
of graduation" contained in the statement dealing with the "enabling clause."&#13;
"Less-developed contracting parties expect that their capacity to&#13;
make contributions or negotiated concessions or take other mutually&#13;
agreed action under the provisions and procedures of the General&#13;
- Agreement would improve with the progressive development of their&#13;
economies and improvement in their trade situation and they would&#13;
accordingly expect to participate more fully in the framework of&#13;
rights and obligations under the General Agreement through&#13;
participation in the operation of the GATT System" (Para. 7).&#13;
According to the UNCTAD Report, "the developing countries are&#13;
seriously concerned with the acceptance of this principle and reject its&#13;
application. Not only are there no universally accepted criteria for such&#13;
categorization, but the principle would permit developed countries to dis-&#13;
criminate among developing countries in an arbitrary and unilateral measures."I1I&#13;
Such a negative view is not warranted, however.&#13;
To begin with, the provision in question does not allow for uni-&#13;
lateral and discriminatory actions on the part of the developed countries.&#13;
Nor do signatory developing countries make any commitments as regards&#13;
"graduation." They only "expect to participate more fully" in GATT,once&#13;
their economic development so warrants without taking any obligations as to&#13;
when and how this will happen.-/ This provision will need to be interpreted&#13;
1/ Op. Cit., p. 33.&#13;
2/ For a similar view, see MTN Studies 6, Part 4, p. 165.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
by the signatories, when the participation of the developing countries in the&#13;
relevant Committee is again of importance.&#13;
-Last but not least, the idea underlying the rejection of the&#13;
principle of graduation is that a two-tier system in the world economy, with&#13;
corresponding rights and obligations, is an immutable fact. Yet, history tells&#13;
us that countries do graduate from developing to developed country status. In&#13;
the postwar period, Japan, Israel, and Ireland have made the transition&#13;
and Greece, Portugal, and Spain are in the process of doing so in conjunction&#13;
with their entry into the European Common Market.&#13;
More generally, it should be recognized that in the process of&#13;
development the economic conditions of the individual countries change,&#13;
and so does the need for particular policies. For example, while the&#13;
preferential treatment of the manufacturing sector may be desirable at&#13;
earlier stages of development on infant industry grounds, successful indust-&#13;
rialization will progressively reduce the economic justification of such&#13;
treatment. Adopting a more open trade system will then be in the well-&#13;
conceived interest of the countries in question.&#13;
The least-developed countries, too, have an interest in the more&#13;
industrialized developing countries adopting an increasingly open trade&#13;
system. For one thing, such a system would contribute to shifts in export&#13;
composition towards more sophisticated and skill or capital-intensive&#13;
products in line with changing comparative advantage, thereby providing&#13;
opportunities for the expansion of the exportation of simpler and unskilled-&#13;
labor intensive products by the least-developed countries.-/ For another&#13;
thing, trade liberalization would permit the least-developed countries to&#13;
sell on the markets of their more industrialized brethren.&#13;
1/ Cf. Bela Balassa, "A 'Stages' Approach to Comparative Advantage" in&#13;
Economie.Qrowth and Resources, Edmoud-3Malinvaud, ed.).  Proceedings&#13;
of the 5th World Congress of the International Economic Association&#13;
held in Tokyo in September, 1977, London,Macmillan, forthcoming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Finally, the political decision-making process in the developed&#13;
countries is not favorable to the maintenance of unilateral concessions in&#13;
regard to countries that have established strong positions in world trade.&#13;
A refusal of such. countries to take any step_ towards the establishment of&#13;
a more open trade system may then lead to protectionist pressures in the&#13;
developed countries, with adverse effects for all concerned.l/&#13;
Policies by the Developed Countries&#13;
The next question concerns the actions developed countries may&#13;
take in regard to the international trade system. Proposals for a new&#13;
2/&#13;
round of negotiations in the framework of UNCTAD-   or elsewhere are hardly&#13;
practical.    Such an effort, occupying decision-makers and a large techni-&#13;
cal staff o'er several years, could not be mounted immediately following&#13;
the completion of the Tokyo Round of negotiations that began in the wake&#13;
of the September 1973 Tokyo Declaration.&#13;
Rather, at this juncture, one should impress upon the develop-&#13;
ed countries to abide by the obligations they have taken, to ensure the&#13;
functioning of the dispute settlement and surveillance mechanism, and to accept&#13;
the resolution of disputes that concern them. And, as various provisions of&#13;
the individual Codes and the texts prepared by the framework group .Â±nvolve&#13;
considerable ambiguity, the developed countries should be induced to accept&#13;
interpretations that are favorable to the developing countries.&#13;
1/ For a detailed discussion of the "graduation" issue, followed by recom-&#13;
mendations for dealing with it, see Isaiah Frank, "The 'Graduation' Issue&#13;
on Trade Policy Towards LDCs" World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 334,&#13;
Washington, D.C., June 1979.&#13;
2/ For such a proposal, see UNCTAD Report, pp. 37-38.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Apart from being open to different interpretations, the individual&#13;
Codes and the texts prepared by the framework group are not immutable. Thus,&#13;
all the Codes are subject to periodical reviews, two of them specifically&#13;
provide for revisions and every Code is open to subsequent amendments. As&#13;
noted above, the statement on Differential and More Favorable Treatment;&#13;
Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries also calls&#13;
for a review of its provisions "bearing in mind" the need "to meet the&#13;
development needs of developing countries." Furthermore, in the Ujnder-&#13;
standing Regarding Notification, Consultation, Dispute Settlement, and&#13;
Surveillance, "the Contracting Parties agree to conduct a regular and&#13;
systematic review of development in the trading system," again with special&#13;
reference to "matters affecting the interests of less-developed contracting&#13;
parties." Such reviews provide an opportunity to safeguard the interests&#13;
of the developing countries, and to exert pressure for trade liberalization&#13;
by the developed countries.&#13;
The Draft Code on Safeguard Measures&#13;
The developed countries also have a responsibility to work towards&#13;
the establishment of equitable safeguard procedures. The application of&#13;
safeguard measures is presently regulated by Article XIX of GATT. Article XIX&#13;
has rarely been utilized, however, in part because the country invoking it&#13;
risks retaliation and in part because it does not permit discrimination among&#13;
exporters. -Instead, countries have employed protective measures in the form&#13;
of Orderly Marketing Agreements and Voluntary Export Restraint programs.&#13;
The draft Code on Safeguard Measures, fomulated in the framework of&#13;
the Tokyo Round negotiations, was to bring all types of safeguard actions back&#13;
into the GATT framework. It defined the criteria that would have to be met to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
justify safeguard action; stated the procedures to be followed in taking&#13;
such action; and provided for a consultation and dispute settlement mechanism.&#13;
In the event, an agreement on the Safeguard Code has not been&#13;
reached. While this has largely been due to the differences in the positions&#13;
of the EEC and of the developing countries on the question of selectivity,&#13;
there are other issues left to be settled. They include the need for a&#13;
multinational forum to countenance the application of safeguard measures;&#13;
the length of the time period of application of these measures; and the&#13;
taking of domestic measures of adjustment by developed countries.&#13;
An agreement on the application of safeguard measures is a task&#13;
of great importance. Since the failure of the negotiating parties to agree&#13;
on the Safeguard Code in the MTN, a step in this direction has been taken&#13;
by the creation of a Committee in GATT that is charged to evolve a code.&#13;
From the point-of-view of the developing countries such a code should fulfil&#13;
certain requirements.-Y&#13;
The principal requirement for a system of safeguards should be&#13;
their temporary nature. This would require setting time limits for the&#13;
application of safeguards. Also, in order to ensure that adjustment does&#13;
take place, the extent of the safeguards should diminish over the period&#13;
of their application according to a pre-determined time table.&#13;
If time limits are set for the application of safeguards, one may&#13;
forego the requirement that a multinational forum countenance their imposition.&#13;
An extension of the time period of their application should, however, be&#13;
1/ The starting point for the following discussion is Bela Balassa, "The&#13;
'New Protectionism' and the International Economy," op. cit., pp. 438-71.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
subject to approval by such a forum. Extension should be granted only in&#13;
exceptional circumstances and be dependent on a plan for domestic adjustment.&#13;
They should not be repeated.&#13;
Imposing time limits on the application of safeguards would also&#13;
reduce objections to selectivity that, at any rate, has been practiced by&#13;
developed countries. At the same time, selectivity should be made dependent&#13;
on the fulfilment of well-defined conditions. It should be applied, in the&#13;
first place, to developed country exporters and it should under no circum-&#13;
stance be invoked against least-developed countries. As far as other&#13;
developing countries are concerned, selectivity should be subject to the&#13;
requirement that their share in the domestic consumption of the product in&#13;
question in the importing countries does not decline.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
After reviewing recent developments in the trade policies of the&#13;
developed countries, this paper has set out to evaluate the results of the&#13;
Tokyo Round negotiations from the point-of-view of the developing countries.&#13;
It has been shown that the tariff reductions undertaken by the developed&#13;
countries, and extended to the developing countries, will benefit the exports&#13;
of the latter and this benefit will be offset only in part by the erosion of&#13;
preferences provided under the GSP.&#13;
The developing countries will also derive benefits from the applica-&#13;
tion of the texts formulated by the so-called framework group that provide a&#13;
legal basis for "special and differentiated treatment" and allow them to&#13;
apply measures for balance of payments purposes and safeguard actions for&#13;
development purposes. For reasons noted above, these conclusions are not&#13;
affected by the eventual introduction of a "graduation" procedure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
In November 1979, the Contracting Parties to GATT adopted the tariff&#13;
reductions negotiated in the Tokyo Round and-accepted the text of the statements&#13;
and declarations drawn up by the framework group, which thus became part of GATT.&#13;
Argentina alone among developing countries has so far subscribed to the Codes&#13;
on nontariff measures, however. Yet, as shown above, it is in the interest&#13;
of the developing countries to subscribe to the Codes, the benefits of which&#13;
are generally restricted to the signatories as is special and differential&#13;
treatment for the developing countries.&#13;
One should not interpret these conclusions to imply that the Codes&#13;
on non-tariff measures would be without shortcomings. But, just as it would&#13;
serve no useful purpose to speculate that the Codes could have been more favor-&#13;
able to the developing countries had they more effectively participated in the&#13;
negotiations, from the point-of-view of these countries it would be counter-&#13;
productive to forego participation on the grounds that the Codes have not&#13;
lived up to their expectations. At any rate, while the Codes cannot be modi-&#13;
fied at the present time, the signatory developing countries can contribute to&#13;
shaping them in the process of practical application and can utilize the&#13;
possibilities provided for future revisions and amendments. In fact, it&#13;
would be desirable that a substantial number of developing countries subscribe&#13;
to the individual Codes, so that they can act as a pressure group both to ensure&#13;

            The Tokyo round and the developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            It is suggested that the trend toward
            increased protectionism in LDCs has not continued and, in
            some respects, has been reversed. Tariff reductions
            undertaken in the framework of the Tokyo Round will further
            lower barriers to trade and benefit the LDCs. The adoption
            by GATT of the statements and declarations formulated by the
            so-called framework group also represents a step in this
            direction. Finally, the application of the Codes on
            non-tariff barriers will benefit the LDCs through the
            liberalization of administrative regulations on trade as
            well as through the special and differential treatment these
            countries are to receive under the Codes. At the same time,
            in order to enjoy the benefits provided under the Codes on
            non-tariff barriers, the LDCs will need to subscribe to
            them. This is also desirable to ensure the implementation of
            the Codes and to effect future revisions in the interest of
            the LDCs. In turn, the developed countries are exhorted to
            abide by the obligations they have taken under the Codes and
            to make a concerted effort towards the establishment of
            equitable safeguard procedures.
