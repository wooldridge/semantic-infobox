The GPSA Steering Committee (SC) will initially have 10 members: compromising of the&#13;
following:&#13;
* Three donor agencies (two government bilateral agencies and one private&#13;
foundation/donor);&#13;
* Three CSOs (one from a "part-I" country and two from "part-II" countries); and&#13;
* Three representatives from developing country governments.&#13;
The Vice-President of WBI will serve as the SC chair. In addition, the Program Manager of the&#13;
Secretariat will join the SC in an observer capacity to serve as a resource person and to facilitate&#13;
timely implementation and follow-up of SC decisions. To balance continuity with rotated&#13;
membership, participation in the SC will be on the basis of fixed three-year terms, which will be&#13;
staggered after the first three-year period. The SC may expand its representation provided it&#13;
maintains a numerical balance of members from all three groups.&#13;
Steering Committee Roles and Responsibilities:&#13;

&gt;  Contribute to the development and implementation of a GPSA resource mobilization&#13;
strategy&#13;

quorum of at least six people. Decisions may be made through electronic means between face-to-&#13;
face meetings on a no-objection basis involving all members of the SC.&#13;
The SC will meet in person twice a year or more often if necessary. SC meeting locations and dates&#13;
will be proposed by the Secretariat and agreed by the SC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-&#13;
2. GPSA Secretariat&#13;
A Secretariat housed in the World Bank has the responsibility to manage the funding, networking,&#13;
communications, reporting and administrative tasks of the GPSA as well as the overall&#13;
management of the GPSA, including coordination, administration and grant-making functions:&#13;

*  Roster of Experts. The Secretariat will establish a global Roster of Experts (RoE) in order&#13;
to bring expert advice into the selection of proposals. The RoE will consist of a list of&#13;
individuals with strong knowledge of social accountability approaches and a sound&#13;
understanding of the realities of the participating countries.&#13;

The GPSA will operate in countries whose governments have "opted-in" to the program, and&#13;
World Bank Country Directors will consult with their respective governments and will submit an&#13;
"Opt-In" letter of consent signed by the government to the GPSA Secretariat.&#13;
Governments will be provided each grant proposal for their review for a period of 10-days.&#13;
