DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Background&#13;
I .    Colombia's energy sector is complex and involves a large number of public and private&#13;
institutions in the power, hydrocarbons and coal subsectors. The power subsector includes over&#13;
thirty operating enterprises which are overwhelmingly within the public sector; these companies are&#13;
mostly owned by the National Government through the Ministry of Finance, with the exception of&#13;
three major municipal companies (Bogota, Medellin, and Call). The hydrocarbons subsector is&#13;
commanded by the state oil company, ECOPETROL, with private sector participation in crude&#13;
production and distribution of oil products and gas. The coal subsector can be roughly broken up&#13;
into export-oriented suppliers where the state coal company, CARBOCOL, either operates in&#13;
association with private companies or manages coal mining contracts, and internal market suppliers&#13;
where numerous small mining enterprises deliver coal to industry and power plants. The Ministry&#13;
of Mines and Energy (MMvIE) is in charge of overall energy sector policy; the Minister presides over&#13;
the Boards of the major power sector companies controlled by the National Government, as well as&#13;
the Boards of ECOPETROL and CARBOCOL. Formulation of power and gas regulation is&#13;
responsibility of the Energy Regulatory Commission (Comisi6n de Rgulaci6n de Energia y Gas),&#13;
and its enforcement is entrusted to the Superintendency of Public Services (Superintendencia de&#13;
Servicios Puiblicos). Finally, the Energy Finance Corporation (FEN), also state-owned, operates as&#13;
the sector's financial arm by providing credit, mainly to power sector enterprises.&#13;
2.     The power subsector is emerging from a decade of financial crisis as well as a severe&#13;
supply emergency in 1992; it has not been successful in maintaining continuity of supply to its&#13;
customers and has failed to achieve financial self-reliance. Deep flaws in its institutional and&#13;
regulatory framework are reflected in a history of overspending and massive underpricing. The gas&#13;
subsector exhibits a picture of underdevelopment: although major finds were made in the early 70s,&#13;
deliveries of natural gas have been limited principally to the Atlantic Coast region (where the vast&#13;
majority of current demand is located); there is no country-wide pipeline network and the major&#13;
cities of Medellin and Cali have lacked natural gas supplies (Bogota has only recently been supplied&#13;
with it from local sources). The oil sector exhibits extremely high profits due to rents received from&#13;
crude production but its vertical integration raises questions as to whether its efficiency could be&#13;
increased. The state coal company has run into serious financial problems due to high sunk costs in&#13;
the Cerrejon mine and lower than expected prices on the international market.&#13;
3.     Sector Strategy. The Government's proposed strategy regarding public sector enterprises&#13;
has been to reduce its presence through divestment and reliance on market forces. In the energy&#13;
sector the state cannot withdraw completely because of potentially costly market failures due to: (a)&#13;
economic rents from natural resources such as oil, gas, coal and, to a lesser extent, the hydroelectric&#13;
potential; (b) the importance to society and the economy of a secure power supply; (c) monopoly&#13;
characteristics of transmission and distribution of electricity and natural gas; and (d) environmental&#13;
degradation resulting from energy-related activities. Addressing these policy problems in Colombia&#13;
is particularly complex due to the country's large and diverse endowment of energy resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.      The Government's proposed energy sector strategy seeks to ensure a reliable and efficient&#13;
supply supported by an economic pricing policy and private sector participation. The approach to&#13;
the sources of market failure will consist of using regulatory instruments applied within an industry&#13;
operated by private entrepreneurs. The Government intends to: (a) reduce tariff distortions and&#13;
create a transparent mechanism of targeted subsidies as established in the Constitution; (b) stimulate&#13;
a rational and economic use of fuels; and (c) create the necessary institutions (including commercial&#13;
regulations and pricing procedures) for introducing efficiency incentives into the energy sector.&#13;
5.      Implementation of this strategy has proceeded by addressing the power sector, where&#13;
government failure has been most prominent, followed by the natural gas subsector due to its&#13;
linkages with the former: power supplies are to rely on natural gas for near term generation&#13;
projects, whereas the feasibility of economically distributing gas to major urban communities will&#13;
depend on having a large base consumption from power plants. Oil and coal sector institutional&#13;
issues have not been addressed as yet, since they are perceived as less pressing due to the profits of&#13;
the former and the sunk cost characteristics of the latter's problems.&#13;
6.      The Bank's strategy has been to: (a) assist in building institutions to introduce market&#13;
incentives in the energy sector; (b) support policies in order to ensure the economic supply of&#13;
electricity and gas with due consideration to environmental constraints; (c) promote institutional&#13;
options which confine the Government's role, as far as possible, to that of regulator and policy&#13;
maker; (d) advise the reduction of public resources in the sector by attracting private capital; (e)&#13;
analyze alternatives to rehabilitate the power sector's finances and improve resource allocation&#13;
through correct price signals and focused subsidies for the poor; (f) promote channels for users and&#13;
stakeholders to voice their opinions in sectoral matters that affect them; and (g) recommend the&#13;
efficient use of energy by expanding supplies of natural gas and rational energy use. This strategy&#13;
addresses the main issues raised in two recent Bank energy policy papers' and in the LAC Gas&#13;
Sector Strategy.2&#13;
7.      The Technical Assistance project has been oriented towards providing support to the&#13;
Government in the implementation of sector reforms, and it therefore concentrates on power and&#13;
natural gas where there is evidence that the Government has committed itself by clearly defining its&#13;
role and that of the private sector, by articulating a well-defined strategy and by initiating&#13;
implementation actions. Concerning the electricity industry, it is vital to maintain the impetus of&#13;
institutional reform already under way and, in relation to the emerging natural gas sector, assistance&#13;
in setting up adequate organizations will be critical for its efficient development. The project will&#13;
also assist the Government in defining an overall strategy involving other energy sectors, in&#13;
identifying the scope of required reforms and in developing an implementation plan.&#13;
8.      Institutional Reform. Institutional change has been taking place since 1991. A new&#13;
Electricity Law and a Public Domiciliary Services law were promulgated in July, 1994. An Energy&#13;
Regulatory Commission has been created to develop the regulatory controls in the electricity and&#13;
gas sectors, with power to prepare rules and issue specific resolutions concerning economic&#13;
World Bank Policy Papers, The World Bank's Role in the Electric Power Sector and Energy. Efficiency and Conservation in the&#13;
Develoving World (1993).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

regulation (pricing mechanisms, restriction on anticompetitive behavior), technical regulation and&#13;
customer service regulation. At the same time an Energy Policy Unit within MME has been created&#13;
to ensure that economic, environmental, and social costs are taken into account by producers and&#13;
consumers. A Superintendency of Public Services will replace the Ministry of Development in&#13;
enforcing the regulatory controls developed by the Energy Regulatory Commission.&#13;
9.     The Government's proposed power subsector institutional reforms3 include: (a) fostering&#13;
efficiency through competition together with a strong, transparent and independent regulatory&#13;
framework; (b) an institutional restructuring involving the separation of national transmission from&#13;
generation and the corporatization of existing state power companies by ultimately transforming&#13;
them into joint stock corporations; (c) completing the financial restructuring and rehabilitation of&#13;
the subsector through tariff and subsidy reforms; and (d) promoting the participation of private&#13;
sector capital in new projects as well as divesting itself of existing power plants and utilities.&#13;
10.    The implementation of these reforms is under way: Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a consulting firm,&#13;
was and is assisting the Energy Regulatory Commission in its initial setup phase; private sector&#13;
participation has been promoted through: (a) the installation of 95 MW (Mamonal) of private&#13;
generation in an industrial complex in Cartagena; (b) a 150 MW BOO contract awarded through&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB) to Sevillana de Electricidad, a Spanish utility (both of these&#13;
projects are already in operation); (c) a 880 MW BOO contract (ICB) in Barranquilla awarded to a&#13;
consortium led by ABB and currently being negotiated; (d) the award of a 150 MW ICB project&#13;
awarded to ENRON (Termovalle); and (e) invitation to pre-qualification for a 300 MW BOO&#13;
thermal plant on the Atlantic Coast (La Loma). The generation capacity of these plants totals 1575&#13;
MW, which represents 16% of the total installed capacity in Colombia. These developments are to&#13;
be followed shortly by the organization of the open access network operated by an independent&#13;
transmission company. These achievements should be seen as the consequence of the effort that&#13;
went into devising the sector's reforms. The TA project will support the restructuring program&#13;
which will require greater funds given the increasing complexity of the tasks which lie ahead.&#13;
11.    The gas sector's basic institutional framework will be promulgated in 1994; the&#13;
corresponding groundwork has been developed by Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The Bank has supported&#13;
these implementation efforts by financing consultants' work through the Japanese Grant Facility and&#13;
the Public Sector Reform Loan. However, much remains to be done: the Policy Unit requires&#13;
support for discharging its functions effectively; the structure of the natural gas industry must be&#13;
decided and the necessary institutions must be developed; power sector plans related to divestment&#13;
have yet to materialize and many regulations and market structure alternatives have yet to be&#13;
implemented.&#13;
12.    Project Objectives. The proposed TA project provides a direct application of the country&#13;
assistance strategy by preserving the momentum gained over the immediate past regarding&#13;
institutional reform by passing from the study and design stages to the more resource-intensive&#13;
phase of recommended actions. The objectives of the project are: (a) to implement regulatory&#13;
reforms by strengthening the newly created entities in charge of regulation and energy policy&#13;

formulation and implementation for the power and gas sub-sectors in order to help them build&#13;
experience and thereby increase their chances of performing efficiently; (b) to implement strategies&#13;
specifically designed for the energy sector, respecting environmental concerns and constraints and&#13;
attracting private investment in the sector; and (c) to develop a demand-side management strategy&#13;
and assist in its implementation.&#13;
13.    Objectives specific to the power sub-sector are to achieve the divestment of state-owned&#13;
assets or enterprises, to attract new private investments for system expansion, and to execute the&#13;
institutional reforms required for putting in place a fully competitive market at the generation level.&#13;
Objectives specific to the gas sub-sectors are to assist in developing the industry's structure and&#13;
regulations for building up a gas market, and to assist in setting up the required organizations. The&#13;
environmental care objective is to develop a consistent set of environmental guidelines for energy&#13;
sector development. Demand-side management objectives are to develop standards and guidelines&#13;
for efficient energy use and to disseminate them among consumers and industries.&#13;
14.    Project Description. The Technical Assistance project seeks to facilitate and speed up&#13;
the transition from a publicly-owned sector organization to one with private participation.&#13;
Comprehensive institutional and policy reforms in infrastructure may require many years to design&#13;
and implement, even in developed countries. The process is necessarily iterative and progressive.&#13;
It is therefore necessary for Bank assistance to be of sufficient duration and with sufficient leverage&#13;
to provide consistent, sustained support to the varying needs at different stages during this process.&#13;
In order to ensure a successful transfer of knowledge, the project will inevitably have to span a&#13;
significant period of time (estimated to be around 4 to 5 years); otherwise, given the volatility of&#13;
institutional memory, the resources are likely to be lost.&#13;
15.    The outputs of the project are summarized in the Action Plan matrix (Annex 4).&#13;
Monitoring of project progress will involve both a control of technical assistance output through&#13;
progress reports and review meetings with consultants, and a control of timely implementation&#13;
actions by the Government. The recipients of technical assistance will be the institutions involved in&#13;
sectoral reforms, namely the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (in particular its&#13;
Energy Policy Unit), ISA (the interconnection company) and the Energy Regulatory Commission;&#13;
this list could be extended to other institutions, such as the Superintendency of Public Services,&#13;
insofar as energy matters are concerned.&#13;
16.    Project Components. The elements of the TA have been organized into five modules,&#13;
corresponding to: (a) overall regulation, pricing and policy activities; (b) specific power sector&#13;
tasks; (c) gas sector activities; (d) environmental matters; and (e) energy demand management and&#13;
safety enhancement. Each of the following sections provides sector-specific background and a&#13;
detailed description of each component within the project including its recipient, its objectives and&#13;
scope, and the proposed organization for implementation.&#13;
MODULE 1: REGULATION, PRICING AND ENERGY POLICY&#13;
17.    The predominantly public-sector ownership of energy resources has precluded economic&#13;
regulation regarding the supply of electricity or natural gas. If these sectors are to accept private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
sector participation, regulation becomes practically indispensable due to Irarket failures stemming&#13;
from natural monopoly characteristics. Similarly, sector planning has been concentrated within&#13;
government-owned operating organizations; with private sector participation, centralized and&#13;
compulsory planning has been replaced by indicative planning and responsibility for this function&#13;
has been vested in an Energy Policy Unit in MME.&#13;
18.    The organization of the Energy Regulatory Commission is currently under way,&#13;
particularly insofar as power sector regulations are concerned; the Policy Unit is being organized&#13;
but its resources, originating within Mme's budget, are insufficient and need to be supplemented.&#13;
Other institutional developments taking place concern the Electricity Law and the Domiciliary&#13;
Public Services Law which will provide the basic framework for policy implementation.&#13;
19.    The assistance envisaged in this module will be addressed principally to the Energy&#13;
Regulatory Commission and to the Policy Unit of MIME. Project components for these institutions&#13;
span both the power and natural gas subsectors:&#13;
(a)  Assistance to the Energy Regulatory Commission in power subsector matters, which&#13;
is required beyond the design phase (currently being completed with Coopers &amp;&#13;
Lybrand) for establishing the operational procedures for price setting and regulatory&#13;
reviews of the Commission;&#13;
(b)  Assistance to the Policy Unit in: (i) supporting MME for overall energy policy and&#13;
strategy formulation; (ii) coordinating the power sector's indicative expansion plan;&#13;
(iii) providing information to private investors and MIME with respect to future&#13;
investment prospects; (iv) developing policies for rural electrification and energy&#13;
supply to isolated communities; and (v) developing expertise for drawing up a&#13;
natural gas expansion plan;&#13;
(c)  Assistance to the Energy Regulatory Commission in developing a statute for Natural&#13;
Gas, together with the sector's regulations, using a similar approach to that of the&#13;
power subsector, thereby keeping pace with the evolution of the natural gas&#13;
infrastructure;&#13;
(d)  Assistance to both the Regulatory Commission and the Policy Unit in developing&#13;
guidelines for environment protection (as described further on in the Environment&#13;
Module section).&#13;
Assistance to the Energy Regulatory Commission&#13;
20.    Background. The Energy Regulatory Commission was established by the Electricity Law&#13;
of July, 1994, and its mandate includes the following functions: (a) regulating activities in the&#13;
energy sector in order to promote an efficient supply; (b) fostering competition and preventing&#13;
anticompetitive or monopolistic behavior; (c) establishing mechanisms to calculate tariffs for&#13;
regulated public services in the energy sector, including transmission charges; (d) developing&#13;
administrative and financial performance indicators for monitoring enterprise management; (e)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
reviewing and modifying the Operations Code for the interconnected system; and (f) protecting&#13;
consumers and monitoring the quality of service delivered by power and gas enterprises.&#13;
21.    The Role of the Regulatory Commission will be complemented by the Superintendency of&#13;
Public Services who is in charge of enforcing regulations and supervising utility performance&#13;
regarding service quality.&#13;
22.    Electricity. Some of these functions are being analyzed for the power sector by Coopers&#13;
&amp; Lybrand. Their consulting activities have been focused principally on organizing a wholesale&#13;
market for electricity, defining the overall regulatory controls and addressing pricing problems both&#13;
at the wholesale and retail levels.&#13;
23.    The Regulatory Commission will continue to promote the pricing adjustment policies&#13;
which have been implemented in the last few years. Electricity tariffs have been continuously&#13;
revised in order to reach economic cost levels and eliminate price distortions within consumer&#13;
sectors; the following table summarizes average tariff levels as a percentage of economic costs&#13;
during 1991-1993 as well as the target levels for 1994-1997:&#13;
YEAR                    1991  1992  1993  1994  1995  1996  1997&#13;
Percent of Economic Cost        72.7  70.9  83.0  87.0  92.7  97.7  100&#13;
24.    Gas. There exists no gas-specific legislation in Colombia; gas-related activities in&#13;
exploration, development, transportation and distribution are guided, by analogy, by the Petroleum&#13;
Code. Recognizing the need to put in place a regulatory regime the Government has hired Coopers&#13;
&amp; Lybrand (with Japanese Grant Facility funds) to assist in the drafting of a statute that would&#13;
establish the basic principles for the functioning of the gas sector. The corresponding decree is&#13;
expected to be promulgated in 1995. However, extensive work will be needed to: (a) prepare the&#13;
subsidiary legislation, rules and regulations required to complete and enforce the institutional and&#13;
regulatory framework to be defined in a Gas Decree or in a Gas Law; (b) set up and make&#13;
operational a gas trading and transportation enterprise (particularly in the areas of contract&#13;
development and pricing policies, including use of system transportation charges); (c) define the&#13;
conditions for the participation of the private sector in the construction of pipelines under BOO and&#13;
BOT schemes; and (d) train staff within the Energy Regulatory Commission and the Energy Policy&#13;
Unit to deal with gas-related matters.&#13;
25.    Natural gas costs are on the order of $1 per million Btu (Mbtu) at the wellhead; wholesale&#13;
and retail costs vary considerably according to location; for example, they are on the order of&#13;
$1. 8/Mbtu for wholesale deliveries and $3.8/Mbtu for retail delivery in Bogota compared to values&#13;
which are expected to be 27% higher in Cali once the pipelines are put in place. Prices are set by&#13;
MME and exhibit wide ranges of variation from one market to another which reflect the fragmented&#13;
nature of the industry. With the development of new trunk pipelines and the interconnection of&#13;
producing fields, bulk prices should become more uniform and a pricing policy will have to be&#13;
developed to address the issues which will arise in the context of an integrated gas industry&#13;
structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
26.    Objectives and Scope. The TA to the Commission is conceived to extend beyond the&#13;
Coopers &amp; Lybrand contract in order to guide the Commission in its initial phases of operation thus&#13;
ensuring that decisions are in accordance with power and gas sector policies, thereby building up a&#13;
consistent body of regulatory precedents. The TA will also cover those areas which have not been&#13;
addressed in the initial phases.&#13;
27.    For the power sector the project will provide assistance, including training, in the&#13;
following areas:&#13;
(a)  Price Regulation: advice on rate schedule modifications, computer modeling for&#13;
tariff calculations and financial evaluations, as well as the resolution of conflicts at&#13;
the wholesale market level;&#13;
(b)  Consumer Protection: this regulatory area has no precedents in Colombia and the&#13;
project would assist in establishing service standards, developing service quality&#13;
monitoring methods for distribution enterprises, organizing procedures for&#13;
responding to consumer complaints, and disseminating information to consumers&#13;
concerning utilities' performance;&#13;
(c)  Technical Matters: support on matters such as the value of lost load, cost analyses,&#13;
financial analyses, codes and norms for distribution concessionaires, network&#13;
charges, and recommendations relative to the modifications of the interconnected&#13;
system's operations agreement; technical assistance will be provided in the form of&#13;
advisory services concerning specific areas;&#13;
(d) Environmental Matters: support to review and consolidate energy related regulations&#13;
into a consistent framework (see Environment module).&#13;
28.    Coopers &amp; Lybrand is developing the regulatory principles that will integrate the new&#13;
natural gas statute, including pricing structures, mechanisms for pricing adjustment over time,&#13;
guidance on key contents of licenses, and a network code. The TA would provide guidance on the&#13;
scope of specific regulations and use of the pipeline network in areas such as:&#13;
(a)  Comprehensive models for trading licenses, and contracts for purchase, sale and&#13;
transportation of gas;&#13;
(b)  The execution of cost studies and financial analyses necessary for establishing price&#13;
levels for regulated consumers and setting use-of-system charges;&#13;
(c) Identifying the conditions that will govern the general terms and conditions to be&#13;
observed by users of the transportation system (e.g. gas quality specification, entry&#13;
pressure, measurement standards, priority rules in the event of capacity limitation,&#13;
daily gas dispatch, methods of accounting, billing and settlement arrangements, etc.);&#13;
(d) Specifying the accounting arrangements for gas utilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
29.    Finally, the assistance to the Energy Regulatory Commission will provide advice relative to&#13;
decision making procedures, in matters such as instituting regulatory proceedings (e.g. whether or&#13;
not to institute public hearings or to rely on more customary procedures), as well as defining the&#13;
legal characteristics of regulatory decisions (Ministerial Decrees or possible altematives). Some of&#13;
these basic issues should be decided within the current consulting project and the TA would provide&#13;
additional support on unresolved questions.&#13;
30.     Results. The TA will help develop a body of regulatory principles and precedents for the&#13;
power sector. This should result in achieving a Regulatory Commission that can command the&#13;
energy sector's respect insofar as sound economic decisions are concemed, thereby providing the&#13;
private sector with visible assurance that power sector investments will not be subject to arbitrary&#13;
rules. The TA will also help develop the bulk of enabling legislation to make effective the&#13;
provisions of the natural gas statute under preparation. It will also provide training for the Energy&#13;
Regulatory Commission staff in matters related to the gas subsector.&#13;
31.    Implementation and Monitoring. The assistance will be carried out through specialized&#13;
consulting services. Monitoring project results will vary according to the type of product (e.g.&#13;
computer models vs. training); given the difficulty associated with monitoring training components&#13;
and the performance of a regulatory entity, an annual performance audit by an independent expert&#13;
will evaluate the project's progress, particularly regarding the functioning of the Regulatory&#13;
Commission.&#13;
Assistance to the Energy Policy Unit (EPU)&#13;
32.    Background. The Policy Unit has been visualized as a relatively small group of skilled&#13;
staff who would supervise the execution of strategic planning studies which would be contracted&#13;
either to sector enterprises (such as ISA in the power sector) or consulting companies and would&#13;
advise the Ministry on energy strategy and policy. Its function regarding the energy sector consists&#13;
of acting as a provider of information in order to enable public and private entities to make&#13;
appropriate economic decisions. This function is particularly relevant in Colombia because of the&#13;
high cost of obtaining information due to a complex energy sector with multiple and abundant&#13;
energy sources and interfuel substitution possibilities. The project will support MMNE in setting up&#13;
the Policy Unit in order to fulfill its functions efficiently. Issues to be addressed include:&#13;
(a) Defining the role of Government in ensuring energy supplies and electricity in&#13;
particular;&#13;
(b) Defining the procedures to be followed for structuring a National Energy Strategy&#13;
together with indicative expansion plans for power and gas;&#13;
(c) Defining planning criteria for addressing risk-associated issues;&#13;
(d)  Providing information to developers regarding the recommendations resulting from&#13;
the power subsector indicative plan and defining the scope of Government action&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
regarding the response of power utilities and private sector enterprises to generation&#13;
plant installation in order to ensure reliable supplies;&#13;
(e)  Addressing development and social-related issues such as coverage extension&#13;
policies, rural electrification and power supplies to isolated communities;&#13;
(f) Addressing the question of the institutional structure of the oil subsector and&#13;
possible restructuring requirements;&#13;
(g)  Developing expertise in order to formulate a gas sector expansion plan;&#13;
(h)  Introducing the environmental dimension into sector planning;&#13;
(i)  Procedures to be followed for involving users and other stakeholders in decisions&#13;
regarding energy sector projects.&#13;
33.     Objectives and Scope. TA assistance to the Policy Unit would be oriented towards&#13;
addressing the above issues. The ultimate objective of the proposed assistance is to organize the&#13;
unit and provide staff training in order to efficiently fulfill its responsibilities in response to sector&#13;
developments. It would consist of the following major tasks:&#13;
(a)  Assessment of Policy Unit staffing requirements and human resources in regard to its&#13;
responsibilities;&#13;
(b)  Assessment of infrastructure requirements (e.g. computer and communications&#13;
resources);&#13;
(c)  Defining the scope for execution of specific projects (e.g. pre-feasibility and&#13;
feasibility studies) to support the expansion plan and their budgetary requirements;&#13;
(d)  Defining principles for structuring the indicative power sector expansion plan;&#13;
(e)  Defining similar procedures for the gas sector;&#13;
(f)  Building in environmental constraints, costs and tradeoffs into both the power sector&#13;
and gas sector development plans;&#13;
(g)  Assisting in the development of a National Energy Strategy;&#13;
(h) Assessing alternative structures for the oil subsector;&#13;
(i)   Addressing other policy areas, such as distribution and electrification plans.&#13;
34.     Results. The TA will seek to develop a skilled Policy Unit which can effectively&#13;
coordinate and evaluate the execution of power sector plans, provide information to the Energy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Regulatory Commission and serve as a source of high-level support to the Ministry of Mines and&#13;
Energy for strategy and policy formulation. The recipient will be responsible for putting in place&#13;
the TA recommendations. The TA will extend over the period of initial operations of the Unit in&#13;
order to provide on the job training and thereby ensure that it will function effectively.&#13;
35.    Implementation and Monitoring. Technical assistance will be provided by a resident&#13;
individual consultant, an international expert with ample experience in managing and organizing&#13;
advisory government institutions in the energy field, supplemented with specialized support in&#13;
specific subjects. Consulting firms will provide support in developing the energy strategy and a&#13;
training program will be designed for the Unit's staff. MME will be responsible for the&#13;
implementation of project recommendations, such as creating the requisite positions with the&#13;
corresponding budgetary appropriations and hiring the required personnel. Project monitoring will&#13;
take place: (a) through periodical reports from the energy expert; and (b) through an annual audit&#13;
similar to the Energy Regulatory Commission audit.&#13;
MODULE 2: POWER SECTOR ASSISTANCE&#13;
36.    The technical assistance to the power sector has been conceived as a complement to the&#13;
on-going institutional reform plan. Implementation has proceeded on several fronts:&#13;
(a)  In 1991 and 1992 the Government initiated a financial rehabilitation of the power&#13;
sector through a number of debt/equity swaps and debt rescheduling operations;&#13;
(b)  Actions on the price front have consisted of a 14% average tariff increase in real&#13;
terms between 1991 and 1993, and the approval for targeting subsidies exclusively&#13;
to the lowest income consumers and reducing them drastically for all others;&#13;
(c)  The new Electricity Law, which sets the legal framework for the power and the gas&#13;
sector reform was promulgated.&#13;
37.    Within the power subsector, the project consists of the following components: (a)&#13;
implementing sector strategies and policies, particularly the divestment of state-owned assets; (b)&#13;
completing the legal and regulatory reform of the energy sector; and (c) providing assistance in the&#13;
process of attracting private sector capital (both domestic and foreign) for new investments.&#13;
The components can be broadly classified into the following categories:&#13;
(a) Assistance to the Energy Regulatory Commission as described in the previous&#13;
section;&#13;
(b) Assistance to the Ministry of Finance in the procedure of divestment of government-&#13;
owned assets;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
(c)  Assistance to MI/Ministry of Finance/DNP and sector enterprises in establishing&#13;
the conditions for attracting new investments in power subsector generation and&#13;
distribution;&#13;
(d)  Assistance in organizing a National Grid Company (ISA-Transmission) with the&#13;
exclusive function of operating and developing the national transmission network, as&#13;
well as acting as a clearing house for commercial transactions within the electricity&#13;
market,&#13;
(e)  Assistance in organizing the operating mode of the National Grid Company and&#13;
developing software tools required under new commercial procedures.&#13;
The following sections describe each component separately.&#13;
Assistance in Divestment: Power Generation and Distribution&#13;
38.    Background. As part of the financial rehabilitation of the sector, the Government has&#13;
become the principal shareholder in a number of enterprises; in accordance with the strategy for the&#13;
power sector, the Government has planned to sell shares of power utilities to the private sector.&#13;
The initial targets are electricity distribution companies which represent, in general, the weakest link&#13;
in the power generation-transmission-distribution chain. The recipient of this TA component would&#13;
be the Ministry of Finance as major shareholder in the targeted power companies, and the Minister&#13;
of Mines and Energy.&#13;
39.    Objectives and Scope. The Government's objective in involving the private sector in the&#13;
power sector is to strengthen management and improve efficiency of power utilities, as well as&#13;
limiting its own exposure in terms of guarantees. The rationale for providing technical assistance&#13;
for these projects lies in the difficulties associated with obtaining financially attractive proposals; an&#13;
approach based upon an outright sale is unlikely to elicit a reasonable response given the lack of&#13;
information and experience in Colombia related to these operations. Consequently, the assistance&#13;
will focus on developing viable alternatives (e.g. the issue of bonds convertible to shares or leasing),&#13;
which may vary from one project to another (depending on plant type, size, age, fuel procurement&#13;
and transmission connections), in order to accomplish the Government's objectives. The assistance&#13;
will be oriented towards providing potential bidders with as much information as possible in order&#13;
for them to prepare proposals on the basis of reasonable risk assessments based upon project&#13;
characteristics, the legal framework and available guarantees. Nevertheless, the guiding principles&#13;
will be "transparency", simplicity, and maximization of long term economic benefit to Colombia.&#13;
40.    The proposed technical assistance would consist of: (a) providing the Ministry of Finance&#13;
with options for divestment of power utilities; (b) marketing and promoting the project according to&#13;
the preferred option; (c) assisting the recipient in the bidding process; and (d) providing advisory&#13;
services in negotiation of successful bids and contract design.&#13;
The assistance would involve the following tasks:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(a)    Analyzing the conditions of power utilities and preparing divestment options;&#13;
(b)   Preparing a project brochure;&#13;
(c)   Identifying potential investors and promoting the project among them;&#13;
(d)   Preparing invitations to bid;&#13;
(e)    Performing a preliminary screening of proponents;&#13;
(f)    Preparing procedures for bid evaluation;&#13;
(g)    Analyzing financing altematives proposed by bidders;&#13;
(h)   Bid analysis and recommendations;&#13;
(i)    Assistance in contract negotiation and contract design;&#13;
(j)    Procedures for monitoring contract performance.&#13;
41.     Results. This component of the project should materialize in the effective divestment of&#13;
power utilities. The major milestones to be achieved for each sub-project, which are the major&#13;
responsibility of the recipient, consist of:&#13;
(a)    Hiring of TA consultant services;&#13;
(b)   Design of strategy for sale of shares of selected power utilities;&#13;
(c)    Distribution of invitations to bid;&#13;
(d)    Sale of shares;&#13;
42.    Implementation and Monitoring. The assistance will be carried out by teams of&#13;
specialists. Each subcontract will be awarded to a single consortium of intemational/national&#13;
consultants on the basis of their technical proposals. General terms of reference for the hiring of&#13;
consultants have been prepared; the detailed terms of reference for each project and the evaluation&#13;
of proposals will be carried out by the project coordinating unit together with the TA recipient's&#13;
staff and extemal advisory assistance. Project results will be monitored and evaluated according to&#13;
the success in divesting the assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Assistance in Attracting New Investment&#13;
43.    Background. The new power sector strategy envisages that generation should expand&#13;
according to an indicative plan that will provide information to potential investors, as opposed to a&#13;
compulsory one. It is also envisaged that all additional thermal plants will be in the private sector.&#13;
Consequently, it is expected that companies will develop new generation plants according to their&#13;
needs and will bear the responsibility for these investments. In accordance with the strategy&#13;
independent power producers will own, in the next four to five years a total of 1575 MW&#13;
44.    Most of the current developments (with the exception of the Mamonal plant owned by&#13;
PROELECTRICA and the Termovalle one owned by a consortium led by ENRON) have relied&#13;
heavily on attracting investors by providing government guarantees to the private contractor&#13;
ensuring its cash flow. This stage should be considered as an intermediate step while the private&#13;
sector builds up experience working within the new institutional framework of the power sector.&#13;
Once confidence is established a full market operation will be reached where power producers can&#13;
enter the generation business without government support.&#13;
45.    Objectives and Scope. The recipients of the TA would consist of MME and the power&#13;
companies interested in signing long-term power purchase agreements with independent power&#13;
producers. The ultimate objective of this TA component is to assist the Government in reducing its&#13;
exposure in the electricity generation business by attracting private investors. The major tasks&#13;
(which may vary in scope from one sub-project to another) envisioned for this component consist&#13;
of:&#13;
(a) Developing prefeasibility or feasibility studies for selected candidate plants;&#13;
(b) Assisting the recipient in the preparation of tenders for soliciting private sector&#13;
participation;&#13;
(c) Advisory services in the negotiation of successful bids and contract development.&#13;
46.    Results. This component of the project should materialize in awarding the building and&#13;
operation of power plants to successful bidders. The major milestones to be achieved for each sub-&#13;
project, which are the major responsibility of the recipient, consist of:&#13;
(a) Hiring of TA consultant services;&#13;
(b) Approval of bidding documents;&#13;
(c) Distribution of invitations to bid;&#13;
(d) Bid award;&#13;
(e) Completion of BOO (or similar) contracts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
47.    Implementation and Monitoring. The assistance will be carried out by teams of&#13;
specialists. Each subcontract will be awarded to a single consortium of international/national&#13;
consultants on the basis of their technical proposals. General terms of reference for hiring&#13;
consultants have been prepared; the detailed terms of reference for each sub-project and the&#13;
evaluation of proposals will be carried out by the project coordinating unit together with the TA&#13;
recipient's staff and external advisory assistance. Project execution will be monitored according to&#13;
its success in attracting private investors and executing the projects.&#13;
Assistance to the Grid Operator&#13;
48.    Background. National transmission is currently the responsibility of ISA (which also&#13;
owns a major portion of system generation) and other utilities which own trunk lines. The&#13;
Government is at present the major shareholder in the company and it intends to separate the&#13;
generation and transmission businesses into different corporations. Dispatch procedures and&#13;
software were developed during 1980-1986 and will require substantial modifications under the&#13;
new sectoral structure.&#13;
49.     Objectives and Scope. The TA seeks to provide advisory services in the process of&#13;
reorganizing ISA into separate corporations. Financial, accounting and personnel aspects of the&#13;
transition to these new corporations are important areas where advice will be given. The ultimate&#13;
objective consists of organizing a separate network operator entity which can efficiently fulfill&#13;
functions of system dispatch under the new wholesale market rules, transactions clearing, system&#13;
security, transmission maintenance and, possibly, support for the MME Policy Unit.&#13;
The activities envisaged for this component consist of:&#13;
(a) Procedures for the corporate separation of ISA in transmission and generation, and&#13;
organization of the new enterprises;&#13;
(b)  Advice during the separation process;&#13;
(c)  Modification of dispatch rules and clearing house functions according to the&#13;
procedures and Grid Code recently developed within the Energy Regulatory&#13;
Commission consultancy contract;&#13;
(d)  Specification, development and testing of the settlement software; training of ISA's&#13;
personnel on the use of economical load dispatch and financial settlement models;&#13;
(e)  Development of information systems for dispatch and settlement.&#13;
50.    Results. Two types of results will gauge the progress of this component:&#13;
(a) The effective and satisfactory separation of generation and transmission;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(b) The efficient operation of the grid operator with respect to system dispatch and&#13;
transactions clearing.&#13;
51.    Implementation and Monitoring. The TA will be executed mainly through large&#13;
international consulting firms associated with local consultants. The project will be monitored on&#13;
the basis of its success in achieving the results listed in the previous paragraph.&#13;
MODULE 3: GAS SECTOR ASSISTANCE&#13;
52.    Background. Current natural gas consumption is 400 million cubic feet per day&#13;
concentrated mainly in the Atlantic Coast and Santander regions. The gas is used primarily for&#13;
electricity generation and industrial heat, with a relatively small residential and commercial market.&#13;
Because of the limited size of the gas industry and the dispersion of producing gas fields, there is no&#13;
integrated national pipeline network.&#13;
53.    Gas development is currently a responsibility of ECOPETROL, the state oil company.&#13;
The interests of this enterprise have naturally been oriented towards crude production and refining&#13;
activities where it derives most of its income. This situation is likely to become more pronounced&#13;
with the recent discovery of large oil fields. The consultants who are analyzing the gas sector's&#13;
structure have proposed the creation of a gas-dedicated company similar to the grid operator in the&#13;
electricity subsector; the government is examining this proposal and intends to organize it with&#13;
private capital participation.&#13;
54.    In December 1991 the Government designed a program to substitute gas for more costly&#13;
fuels, in particular electricity, which is used extensively for domestic uses. In March, 1993,&#13;
prompted in good measure by the large gas discoveries in the Cusiana oil field, the Government&#13;
decided to accelerate the implementation of the gas program and approved the National Gas Plan&#13;
setting a number of objectives and preliminary proposals, including:&#13;
(a)  The use of private capital in the construction of new trunk lines on a build-own-&#13;
operate (BOO) and build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis;&#13;
(b)  Deregulation of gas prices for large consumers (power generation and large&#13;
industry);&#13;
(c)  Protecting the interests of smaller consumers and promoting substitution of gas for&#13;
electricity;&#13;
(d)  Encouraging competition in gas supply, where appropriate, by providing gas&#13;
producers with access to pipeline networks.&#13;
55.    The plan envisages investing US$ 550 million in the 1994-1998 period in construction of&#13;
gas pipelines and the creation (with private sector participation) of a mixed capital enterprise in&#13;
charge of gas transportation and promoting the development of new gas pipelines. The long-run&#13;
plans of the Government contemplate an ambitious investment program of up to $3 billion by 2020.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
A major initial step in the implementation of the Government's policy was taken in late 1993 with&#13;
the award by ECOPETROL of a BOO contract for the principal trunk pipeline connecting the&#13;
Atlantic fields to the central region fields.&#13;
56.    Components of Gas Sector Technical Assistance. The most important component of&#13;
the assistance to the gas sector is directed towards implementing the new institutional framework&#13;
through the Energy Regulatory Commission and the Policy Unit (see Module 1) in order to&#13;
accomplish the objectives stated above. Specific Gas Industry components responding to the&#13;
strategy of minimizing Government's involvement and encouraging development with private sector&#13;
participation will be included:&#13;
(a) to develop a plan for the implementation of a new gas industry structure with private&#13;
sector participation;&#13;
(b) to advise the Government on negotiations with the private sector to set up a new&#13;
mixed-capital gas company(ies).&#13;
57.    Objectives and Scope. The objectives of this component are: (a) to improve the&#13;
operations of the gas sector and promote natural gas use; (b) to render gas pipeline investments&#13;
viable; and (c) to create a large gas market with private sector participation. The Technical&#13;
Assistance will support the development of a plan for the implementation of a new gas industry&#13;
structure, and assistance to the Government on negotiations with private companies involved in&#13;
setting up new enterprises in this subsector.&#13;
58.    Implementation. Legal and commercial advice to the Government regarding negotiations&#13;
with the private sector will be provided by lawyers and a merchant bank with international&#13;
experience. The Ministry of Mines and Energy will be responsible for the supervision of the&#13;
consultants' work&#13;
MODULE 4: ENVIRONMENT&#13;
59.    The energy sector has become aware of the importance of environmental issues, and the&#13;
power sector organized a Power Sector Environmental Committee with an executive branch at the&#13;
vice-presidential level within ISA, the interconnection enterprise. Power sector project analysis is&#13;
now routinely complemented with an environmental impact assessment encompassing both physical&#13;
and social consequences. A Power Sector Environmental Assessment, financed by ISA and&#13;
supervised by the Bank, was completed and delivered its conclusions and recommendations by mid&#13;
1994. It is worthwhile noting that there has been considerable receptivity to these considerations&#13;
and that, as a consequence, a number of projects have undergone design modifications.&#13;
60.    The Government has recently organized a Ministry of the Environment which will also&#13;
address energy-related problems. The Technical Assistance project will assist in the construction of&#13;
a consistent set of guidelines, which will constitute an appropriate base for future sectoral&#13;
environmental regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
61.    Environmental Assistance Components. The size and scope of physical and regulatory&#13;
components contained in both the power sector and the gas sector plans require two kinds of&#13;
environmnental analyses:&#13;
(a)  Sectoral environmental assessments (SEA) for the purpose of establishing&#13;
environmental guidelines to address a sectoral environmental plan, and&#13;
regulatory/institutional measures, particularly taking into account the role of the&#13;
private sector;&#13;
(b)  Specific environmental assessments dealing with selected new private sector&#13;
projects.&#13;
Sectoral Environmental Assessments (SEAs)&#13;
62.    Background. The set of proposed assessments would encompass the energy sector as a&#13;
whole, but would include differences in emphasis according to the stage of development of power&#13;
and gas, and could also extend to the coal subsector. The assistance would capitalize on the&#13;
experience gained by the Power Sector Environmental Assessment and would translate it into&#13;
guidelines for monitoring both existing energy projects and future developments.&#13;
63.    Objectives and Scope. The Government's objective in developing environmental&#13;
regulations is to comply with the 1991 Constitution, which explicitly mandates the protection of the&#13;
environment as well as the socioeconomic heritage and the well-being of indigenous groups. The&#13;
SEAs would:&#13;
(a)  Identify the main environmental problems caused by energy projects;&#13;
(b) Develop environmental operating guidelines for planning purposes;&#13;
(c) Develop standard relocation procedures and guidelines;&#13;
(d)  Develop methodologies for costing environmental and socioeconomic consequences&#13;
of energy projects and integrating them with project analysis;&#13;
(e)  Develop procedures to involve users and communities affected by energy sector&#13;
projects in the corresponding decisions;&#13;
(f) Disseminate the relevant policies, guidelines, regulations and codes through&#13;
workshops and seminars to the concerned industries and government departments in&#13;
order to stimulate awareness with respect to environmental issues.&#13;
The results of the SEAs would be used as the basis for promulgating and publishing energy&#13;
sector environmental codes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
64.    The recipients of this TA component would be the Energy Regulatory Commission and the&#13;
Energy Policy Unit as well as the subsectors' environmental organizations (e.g. Power Sector&#13;
Environmental Committee, ISA Environmental Office). It is worthwhile noting that the Assessment&#13;
should take an integrated approach: the impacts of developing power, coal and gas should be&#13;
analyzed simultaneously. The project will include a training component oriented towards&#13;
developing key environmental management skills. These include: environmental impact assessments&#13;
and environmental auditing; data base development and management; development of&#13;
environmental information systems and library services; and development of environmental&#13;
education and awareness programs.&#13;
65.    Results. The SEA would provide a common reference for: (a) development and&#13;
publication of an energy sector environmental policy and an environmental action plan; (b)&#13;
enforcing environmental norms concerning all activities related to the production of electricity and&#13;
natural gas, and to their transmission and distribution to final consumers; (c) publication of&#13;
guidelines for the energy sector in respect of solid waste disposal, liquid effluent and air emission&#13;
control, and post-closure redemption. The training component will result in increased awareness at&#13;
the sector level and better decision making capabilities in environmental management and planning.&#13;
Project Environmental Assessments(PEAs)&#13;
66.    This component will be oriented towards financing the execution of specific assessments&#13;
related to projects at the feasibility and prefeasibility level; it will also seek to identify remedial&#13;
measures in the existing system in order to comply with the regulations developed as part of the&#13;
SEA. In particular, it should extend to those power plants being proposed for divestment as well as&#13;
those which are identified in the power and gas sector expansion plans.&#13;
67.    Objectives and Scope. The project environmental assessments will identify the effects of&#13;
selected projects together with the required remedial measures and their cost in order to include&#13;
them in the evaluation of expansion plans and to provide prospective investors with a realistic&#13;
estimate of costs they will have to incur.&#13;
The scope of the required analyses varies from one project to another, and a rough classification&#13;
would include the following items:&#13;
(a)  Existing hydro plants: requirements for watershed conservation, water quality&#13;
control and non-energy uses (irrigation, fishery requirements and drinking water),&#13;
risks for downstream settlers;&#13;
(b)  Future hydro plants: watershed conservation, water quality control, biomass disposal&#13;
consequences, socioeconomic effects, archaeological, historical and cultural site&#13;
conservation, wildlife conservation, population relocation alternatives and costs,&#13;
construction consequences on local residents;&#13;
(c) Thermal plants: air emissions; wastewater discharges, solid waste generation,&#13;
storage, transportation, and disposal, cooling water requirements and management;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(d)  Transmission lines: consequences of clearance requirements on wildlife, farming&#13;
communities, populated centers and archeological sites;&#13;
(e)  Gas pipelines: consequences on land use, fragile ecosystems, socioeconomic effects&#13;
(indigenous peoples and other ethnic groups affected by the project), archeological&#13;
sites; safety (prevention of leaks, spills, corrosion);&#13;
(f)  Coal mines: land use consequences, transportation requirements, wildlife&#13;
conservation, underground mine safety, air emissions, water discharges, solid waste&#13;
disposal, socioeconomic impacts on communities living around the mines.&#13;
68.    Component Projects. The following is a non-exhaustive list of existing projects and&#13;
future developments which are likely to require an environmental assessment:&#13;
(a)  Combined cycle power plants projected for installation in the Valle and Atlantic&#13;
Coast regions;&#13;
(b)  Future coal plants, starting with the 300 MW station to be installed on the Atlantic&#13;
Coast;&#13;
(c)  Future gas pipelines (Guajira-Barranca trunk pipeline and the regional subsystems);&#13;
(d)  Transmission lines required for reinforcement of the interconnected network.&#13;
69.    Implementation and Monitoring. The PEAs will be developed by teams of experienced&#13;
consultants supplemented by specialized advisors. The training component will include the&#13;
participation of energy sector staff in short courses and seminars organized with consultant teams.&#13;
Project monitoring will take place through an evaluation of the SEAs and the PEAs by experienced&#13;
environmental consultants.&#13;
MODULE 5: ENERGY DEMAND MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY ENHANCEMENT&#13;
70.    Background. The World Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance Program&#13;
(ESMAP) conducted a study in 1991-1992 on energy use in the residential, commercial and public&#13;
sectors4. The study emphasizes, in particular, the electricity-intensive household consumption in&#13;
Colombia: whereas other higher income Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil and&#13;
Mexico exhibit an average domestic consumption in the range of 130 to 150 kWh/month, Colombia&#13;
shows an average of 230 kWh/month. This has led to an atypically high residential sector share in&#13;
total sales (around 50%) which reflects uneconomic electricity use caused by low prices and&#13;
constraints on the supply of substitute fuels.&#13;
71.    This module is a complement to the energy pricing component and is aimed at providing&#13;
information to energy consumers so that they may make more informed decisions on its use. Even&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
though the adjustment of power and gas prices to cost related levels will stimulate a more rational&#13;
use of energy, there will still be a need to provide information on the most efficient ways to use&#13;
energy both for industry and for households.&#13;
72.    This Technical Assistance will focus on: (a) the development of a demand side&#13;
management strategy; and (b) the promotion of safe and efficient gas use. The Government of&#13;
Colombia also attaches a high priority to the development of a national strategy for the rational and&#13;
efficient use of energy. The Alternative Energy National Institute (INEA) of the Ministry of Mines&#13;
and Energy requires clear guidance to develop its mandate. This TA will provide the MME with a&#13;
demand side management strategy that INEA, and other institutions in the energy sector, will&#13;
implement.&#13;
73.    In the electricity sector, satisfactory standards and acceptable processes for certification of&#13;
end-use equipment are already in place, whereas the development of the gas industry in Colombia is&#13;
at an incipient stage and therefore standards, codes and operational procedures require upgrading to&#13;
acceptable levels. ICONTEC, the national institute for standards and norms, has been addressing&#13;
these issues in a limited way. It is providing certification of equipment but additional resources are&#13;
required to speed up the process of upgrading gas related standards and codes.&#13;
Demand Side Management (DSM) Strategy&#13;
74.    Background. The DSM strategy will be a complement to the pricing and regulatory&#13;
reform efforts to implement a coherent energy sector policy. This project component will study&#13;
consumer characteristics and behavior to identify main causes for market failure, such as lack of&#13;
consumer information, and support the development of an energy demand management strategy to&#13;
induce the rational use of energy.&#13;
75.    Objectives and Scope. The key objectives of the DSM strategy will be: (a) the rational&#13;
utilization of energy sources; and (b) efficient resource and investment allocation. The work will&#13;
include the updating of information on consumer profiles and behavior as well as consumer&#13;
equipment, and the evaluation of potential savings and the prioritization of areas for action. The&#13;
preparation of a DSM strategy presupposes the implementation of an efficient energy pricing policy.&#13;
76.    Implementation. Consultants' services will be required for assisting in drawing up the&#13;
DSM strategy and for developing a prioritized action plan. The MME, through LNEA, will be&#13;
responsible for the supervision and monitoring of the consultants' work and for carrying out the&#13;
implementation plan.&#13;
Promotion of the Safe and Efricient use of Gas&#13;
77.    Background. A system that will ensure the safe and efficient use of gas is a pre-requisite&#13;
for the orderly development of this sector. Appropriate standards and codes are essential building&#13;
blocks of this development. The Colombian gas industry has been making use of standards applied&#13;
in developing countries on a case by case basis. There is, however, a need for reviewing, updating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
and consolidating the set of standards and codes appropriate to the country's environment, that&#13;
should be followed by all the players in the sector for an integrated and efficient development.&#13;
78.    Objectives and Scope. The specific objectives of this TA are to review and formulate for&#13;
the gas sector: (a) standards for materials and equipment; (b) design parameters, installation and&#13;
operational procedures; and (c) standards for gas quality and supply, using international gas&#13;
standards and codes as the basis. Local and foreign consultants will be required to review the&#13;
existing standards and codes, identify the standards which are missing or which need updating, draft&#13;
the necessary versions and obtain their approval by the appropriate authority.&#13;
79.    Implementation and Monitoring. This project component will be developed in&#13;
cooperation with the local gas industry. The Ministry of Mines and Energy will be responsible for&#13;
the supervision and monitoring of the consultants work.&#13;
Overall Technical Assistance Project Implementation.&#13;
80.    The project will be carried out by an Executing Unit attached to the Energy Policy Unit of&#13;
the MIME and will be guided by a Coordinating Group in charge of overall orientation. A full-time&#13;
project coordinator will be in charge of the executing unit and will be assisted by consultants hired&#13;
to do specific tasks as required. The Coordinating Group will be integrated by representatives from&#13;
the National Planning Department, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and the Energy Regulatory&#13;
Commission.&#13;
81.    Bank staff will hold a project launch workshop in Colombia shortly after the loan signing&#13;
in order to review needed startup actions. The project will be supervised by Bank staff through&#13;
receipt and review of the Annual Implementation Programs, monitoring of Semi-Annual&#13;
Implementation Reports and regular supervision missions. In the case of the Energy Regulatory&#13;
Commission, in addition to Bank supervision, independent experts will be hired to perform an&#13;
annual broad audit of the its activities. A midterm review of the project to assess progress of major&#13;
reforms and institutional buildup pursued under the project and to determine the need for&#13;
adjustments will be held before October 31, 1997. Inputs needed to supervise the project are&#13;
esimated to total about 12 staff-weeks per year during the first two years and 10 staff-weeks per&#13;
year subsequently. Supervision will require the involvement of Bank specialists in environrnent,&#13;
energy regulation, energy economics, power, natural gas, privatization, as well as outside expertise&#13;
in power and gas regulation.&#13;

COLOMBIA: LESSONS FROM THE BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE POWER SECTOR'&#13;
Bank Experience&#13;
I.     Since 1950, the Bank has made 31 loans to the Colombian power sector totaling US$ 2.2&#13;
billion. However, the bulk of Bank lending, US$ 1.94 billion, through 15 loans, was made during&#13;
1970-87. Thirteen operations were Specific Investment Loans (SILs), one Financial Intermediary&#13;
Loan (FIL) and one Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL). About 58% (US$ 1.13 billion) were&#13;
granted directly to the two largest municipal power companies in Bogota (EEB) and Medellin&#13;
(EPM) through eight operations. During this period, EEB has been by far the largest borrower of&#13;
Bank funds with four loans totaling US$ 701m. Four loans for US$ 430.5m were made to EPM.&#13;
The national generation and transmission interconnection company (ISA) also received four loans&#13;
totaling US$ 300m.&#13;
2.     Through the Government one loan was made to Financiera Electrica National (FEN) for&#13;
relending to municipal and Government-owned power companies; and one SECAL for US$ 300m&#13;
intermediated by FEN. Over the same period the Inter American Development Bank (IDB) also&#13;
lent just over US$ 1.9 billion to the Colombian power sector. In less than 20 years, the World&#13;
Bank and the IDB each lent nearly $2 billion for electric power in Colombia - a very high lending&#13;
level for one sector in a country of 30 million people.&#13;
After 1970, institutional, financial and operational efficiency achievements in the power sector fell&#13;
short of forecasts, and by the mid- 1980s, the sector was in financial crisis. The large investments&#13;
made in power depended heavily on government transfers and on external borrowing, and were a&#13;
major cause of fiscal deficits and balance of payments problems.&#13;
3.     At the request of the Colombian government, OED reviewed the World Bank's lending&#13;
through this period of rapid power generation expansion and financial crisis. The study benefited&#13;
from the active support of the Colombian power authorities. The government followed up with a&#13;
two-day seminar, in which OED and other Bank staff participated, to discuss the results of the&#13;
study and the reform of the sector.&#13;
4.     The study found the analytical basis for the lending program weak, and notes that the Bank&#13;
did not insist forcefully enough upon the policies and conditions needed to make the sector&#13;
profitable. The sector's development was still hampered by the same basic problems as 20 years&#13;
ago. Its claims on fiscal resources and its external debt had become so large that these problems&#13;
needed urgent resolution. In particular, decisions were needed on how the sector was to be&#13;
financed in future. This report made recommendations on sector regulation, management, resource&#13;
mobilization, investment strategy, and financing.&#13;
5.     Why did the Bank lend so much for power in Colombia? The goals mainly related to&#13;
sector policy, and the rationalization of the sector's development. But the policy goals seem at&#13;
times to have been given a smaller priority than the implementation of an ambitious lending program&#13;

since the power sector required large investments with the growing demand, providing a natural&#13;
area where Bank lending was requested. Economic and sector work for power in Colombia did not&#13;
match the volume of lending. This Bank experience emphasizes the crucial need for thorough&#13;
power sector work and strategic thinking. At important points in the review period, lack of analysis&#13;
negatively affected lending, and so did the lack of a shared vision by the Bank, Government and&#13;
sector representatives.&#13;
6.     Bank lending supported the following endeavors with generally limited success: (a)&#13;
nationwide master plan for energy/power development - plan preparation was drastically curtailed,&#13;
to accommodate regional interests early in the process; (b) least-cost planning for generation and&#13;
transmission systems - outcome was much influenced by non-economic factors, but too little&#13;
attention to risk factors and sensitivity analysis tilted the investment selection in favor of inflexible&#13;
projects with long lead times and high front-end capital expenditures, and with the recession of the&#13;
early 1980s, resulted in over-capacity by the mid-1980s; (c) reduction of system losses - overall&#13;
system losses grew rapidly from 1978 onwards; by 1987 they were about 25 percent of net power&#13;
generated; (d) marginal cost pricing - ultimately borrowers accepted the principle, but average tariff&#13;
levels stayed very low and tariff distortions worsened; (e) better self-financing - after 1977 sector&#13;
revenues never contributed more than about 5 percent of investment (a recommended range would&#13;
be 30 - 50 percent; (f) reduced dependence on official borrowing - not achieved. The World Bank&#13;
and IDB provided 80 percent of external borrowing for power in 1980-87; (g) balanced investment&#13;
program - investments stayed skewed toward hydro as opposed to thermal power generation, and&#13;
toward generation and transmission, at the expense of distribution; and (h) presentation of unified&#13;
sector data - unified data presentation, compatible financial accounting, across utilities, not&#13;
achieved; arriving at an overall view of sector finances was still very difficult at the end of this&#13;
period.&#13;
7.     To sum up, Colombia's power entities over the years achieved a high level of technical&#13;
expertise. At issue was a more enabling framework in areas of policy formulation and organization.&#13;
Though the Bank helped the sector to achieve substantial expansion of coverage, most of the&#13;
problems noted in those areas by OED evaluation studies of 20 years ago were not resolved during&#13;
1970-1987:&#13;
(a)   Grossly inadequate local resource mobilization;&#13;
(b)   Poor financial performance;&#13;
(c)   Unbalanced investment program;&#13;
(d)   Investment selection procedures that may lead to sub-optimal projects;&#13;
(e)   Cumbersome institutional structure and weak regulatory framework.&#13;

Main Issues and Ways to Tackle them&#13;
8.     The Colombian power sector has urgently needed to solve certain fundamental long-term&#13;
issues which have been at the root of most others. It has also needed to solve critical short-term&#13;
sector financial problems. The following actions provide the basics for solving the long term issues:&#13;
(a)  Defining a sector strategy based on a set of specific sector objectives in line with&#13;
wider energy sector objectives, which, in turn, should be properly embedded in&#13;
Government's macroeconomic policies; defining a corresponding regulatory and&#13;
institutional framework, with clear principles and 'rules of the game'.&#13;
(b)  Establishing a strong regulatory body. This will always be required independently of&#13;
whether the specific sector objectives imply development toward overall&#13;
centralization (highly unlikely in the Colombian context) or toward a set of central&#13;
and regional utilities with substantial autonomy, or even toward various degrees of&#13;
privatization.&#13;
(c)  Supporting a thorough rethinking of the functions ISA has to fulfill and of a proper&#13;
framework in which these functions should be discharged. While ISA's setup, as&#13;
conceived in 1968 on the basis of a compromise, and as subsequently adjusted,&#13;
provided for a long time a reasonable framework, it ran its course in the next 20&#13;
years.&#13;
(d) Defining a new sector structure based on a consensual process among all the&#13;
partners. The Bank's role would be to induce the partners to discuss candidly sector&#13;
issues, in particular, the politically sensitive sector structure, the role of Government&#13;
in the sector, as well as the array of possible solutions. The Bank could also be of&#13;
help to the Government and the entities involved in the sector arrive at the positions&#13;
from which decisions would be made. It should then be willing to accompany them&#13;
on the arduous and long path of implementation. Based on its review, OED&#13;
recommends that Bank lending should: (i) consistently take the sector approach; (ii)&#13;
avoid the pervasive, at times utterly unrealistic optimism, that has characterized&#13;
several of the OED-reviewed operations; and (iii) insist on action by Government&#13;
and the sector each time before it submits an operation for Board presentation.&#13;
9.     The Bank has also needed to come to grips with the requirement to reconcile the expected&#13;
centralized responsibilities of regulatory authorities with the essentially decentralized structure of&#13;
the utility companies, and to the need to restructure and redefine the role of ISA. An open&#13;
approach was seen by OED as of help to the Bank in its dealings with the Colombian power sector.&#13;
It would also help mobilize the strengths of strong Colombian regionalism to the advantage of&#13;
sector development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -                                 ANNEX I&#13;
Sector Specific Recommendations&#13;
10.     OED suggested a series of more specific recommendations set forth below:&#13;
(a)  Institutional Framework. Once the specific sector objectives are defined,&#13;
Government would have to: define and implement the strategy according to which&#13;
the sector decides to meet demand; set the ground rules for using national resources&#13;
in the power sector; clarify the basic rules of commercial operation of the utilities;&#13;
define, in general terms, the type of operations that Government would subsidize;&#13;
spell out the principles of setting electricity bulk and retail tariffs, and their relation&#13;
to economic costs, as well as the measure of cross-subsidies between consumer&#13;
categories that would be tolerated; there should be no cross subsidies across&#13;
markets; and to the extent that the Government needs to provide tariff subsidies on&#13;
equity ground or market structure (poor rural areas) the subsidies should be explicit&#13;
and the onus should be on the Government to directly compensate the affected&#13;
utility.&#13;
(b)  Regulatory Framework. The responsible entity should, in general, translate&#13;
Government objectives and policies into sector rules, and monitor sector compliance&#13;
with them.&#13;
(c) Re-alignment and Concentration of Utilities. This action would represent a&#13;
substantial step towards increased efficiency in the sector and the Bank should&#13;
induce the sector to define as soon as possible its feasibility.&#13;
(d)  ISA's Structure and role. The Bank, as ISA's main sponsor, should assist&#13;
Government and the sector in re-examining ISA's structure and role, taking into&#13;
account that ISA should preserve its practical approach to planning, and shield&#13;
planning from political influence before the start of the decision making process&#13;
proper.&#13;
(e)  Tariffs. Beyond the suggestions above, the Bank should: continue to support a&#13;
strong tariff regulatory body and further improvements to the present tariff rules;&#13;
insist on substantial tariff action toward economic pricing of electricity, both at the&#13;
retail and bulk levels, each time before it submits a new operation for Board&#13;
approval; systematically assess the economic and financial suitability of tariff levels;&#13;
and emphasize the role of the bulk tariff as a key factor in the pricing of electricity.&#13;
(f) Finances. Utilities and sector finances need to be turned around on the basis of the&#13;
new institutional setup. Once basic principles are agreed, their application will&#13;
include a financial component that, in several steps, will allow the utilities to re-&#13;
establish their cash generation capacity, strengthen their capitalization, bring&#13;
receivables to acceptable levels, and thus allow the companies to operate in an&#13;
accountable environment. To support this development, the sector should achieve&#13;
reasonable uniformity in sector accounts and statistics to enable preparation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 26 -                               ANNEX I&#13;
meaningful consolidation of utilities' finances, and monitor their regulatory&#13;
commitments.&#13;
(g) Investment Program. The sector would need a more balanced investment program&#13;
with a proper share for sub-transmission and distribution. It would have to address&#13;
the shortcomings of planning and decision making through a more realistic time and&#13;
cost scheduling of projects and a bolder approach to sensitivity and risk analysis.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Energy Sector
            Technical Assistance Loan are to: 1) implement regulatory
            reforms for the power and gas sub-sectors; 2) implement
            strategies specifically designed for the energy sector,
            respecting environmental concerns and constraints and
            attracting private investment in the sector; and 3) develop
            a demand-side management strategy and assist in its
            implementation. The project includes the following
            components: 1) overall regulation, pricing and energy
            policy; 2) specific power sector assistance which includes
            engineering and investment banking assistance and
            privatization exports to help mobilize private capital for
            new power generation and distribution projects; divestment
            of existing public-sector controlled power plants;
            corporatization and privatization of utilities; and creation
            of the new grid company to facilitate competition between
            electricity generators; 3) specific gas sector assistance in
            developing a new industry structure and regulations for the
            natural gas market incorporating private sector
            participation and competition; 4) assistance in executing
            sectoral environmental assessments together with project
            environmental assessments, formulating energy sector
            environmental regulations and guidelines; and 5) energy
            demand management and safety enhancement by developing a
            demand side management strategy for efficient energy use.
