Progress towards the sanitation target has been uneven. While       able representation of the better practices in sanitation&#13;

&#13;
Three crucial questions in all development activities financed&#13;
by the World Bank are "How much will it cost?" "How will&#13;
it be paid for?" and "Who pays what?" To help answer these&#13;
questions, the World Bank undertook a study of utility&#13;
subsidies in water supply and electricity.2 Although sanita-&#13;
tion was supposed to be included, the authors quickly found&#13;
an almost complete lack of data on the topic. As a result,&#13;
the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and the Water&#13;
Anchor of the World Bank have collaborated in managing&#13;
this study as a first step to painting a full picture of finance&#13;
and costs in sanitation.&#13;

&#13;
1   For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, where there has been limited investment from governments and donors in on-site sanitation, the Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic&#13;
    (AICD) showed that, on average, 50% of the population use unimproved traditional latrines while 34% resort to open defecation. Only the families in the top three income&#13;
    quintiles are likely to have improved sanitation facilities, and the majority of cases of household investment in improved sanitation were in the higher-income households.&#13;

10 The "community animators" were transferred to municipalities but effectively stopped promoting sanitation, which resulted in decreased interest in the product. Responsibility&#13;
   for paying production subsidies was transferred to the provincial governments. Some provinces stopped giving the subsidies, and others kept their level unchanged since 2000,&#13;
   even while production costs have increased significantly. As a result, the workshops have had to carry out other income-generating activities in order to cross-subsidize slab and&#13;
   latrine production costs.&#13;
11 Investments almost always included a washing facility and soakaway (Bac à Laver Puisard), which contributes to the overall cleanliness of the yard and can reduce the incidence&#13;
   of diseases but is not a sanitation solution by our definition (or that of the JMP) since it does not contribute to safe excreta management.&#13;

     20 Common ways of measuring the effectiveness of poverty targeting consist of evaluating errors of inclusion (when relatively well-off people find themselves benefiting from subsidies)&#13;
        and errors of exclusion (when members of the target group are not captured by the eligibility criteria) associated with the targeting mechanism. See for example: Komives et al.&#13;

     21 The costs of alternative targeting mechanisms are an important factor to take into account when designing the financial approach. In the case of Senegal, the costs and benefits of alternative&#13;
        targeting mechanisms for subsidized water connections have been extensively reviewed. In that case, it was concluded that regional targeting was the most cost-effective solution.&#13;

     existing workshops cannot scale up their activities because                                   more significant constraint than finance is the availability of&#13;

In Vietnam, scaling up the financing approach appears                                        and are encouraged to invest in higher service levels if they&#13;

this approach, the financial cost would be about US$16                                       however, as they suffer from a relatively high exclusion error&#13;

Based on the growing body of research on the topic, opera-&#13;
tional guidance should be prepared to assist policy makers&#13;
and project designers with the design of the optimal financing&#13;
approach suited to their country or project circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
This study has shown that there is no one-size-fits-all financ-&#13;
ing approach that would work in all circumstances. Rather,&#13;
principles from experience are emerging on how financing&#13;
approaches can best be tailored to meet the needs of the local&#13;
situation. Key factors that need to be taken into account&#13;
when designing a financing approach include the latent and&#13;
expressed demand of potential recipients for different levels&#13;
of service, technical factors and market conditions driving&#13;
the costs of provision, poverty levels and geography (that&#13;
is, whether the poor live in well identified areas or are more&#13;
spread out), the state of local credit markets, the institu-&#13;
tional set-up of the sanitation sector, and existing financing&#13;
practices for on-site sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Rather than prescribing set solutions, such guidance should set&#13;
out options to navigate through these key factors and choices,&#13;
so as to maximize the impact of public funds and accelerate&#13;
progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.&#13;

      Some lessons learned&#13;
      What worked?                · households were mobilized to build low-cost latrines through community action, which reduced dependency on&#13;
                                     subsidies while meeting households' demands.&#13;
                                  · Partial hardware subsidies helped the poorest to participate in overall community effort. The dishari approach&#13;
                                     based on community involvement radically improved the targeting of subsidies provided by the central govern-&#13;

The government monitoring and evaluation system still&#13;
remainsweak, as it is based on self-reporting by the unions.&#13;
Third-party verification is not exercised and there is a&#13;
tendency to over-report, given that achievement of ODF&#13;
status triggers a one-off monetary reward, with no attempt&#13;
to verify that coverage is maintained beyond that point. The&#13;
inclusion of monetary rewards therefore may have intro-&#13;
duced a perverse incentive to over-report results. Ongoing&#13;
monitoring should be introduced (perhaps with the possi-&#13;
bility of clawing back some of the rewards) so that such&#13;
improvements can be sustained over time.&#13;

Note 1: The software costs shown in this table only include those of the TSC campaign. In addition, it is important to note that district, block and village-level officers spend&#13;
considerable amounts of their time on supporting sanitation. We did not obtain specific figures for these costs, which means that the administrative costs have been underestimated,&#13;
although this is unlikely to represent a large amount, especially when compared to the size of household investments.&#13;
Note 2: The TSC funds are the budgeted funds. Disbursement delays may occur.&#13;

 hardware subsidies              · Output-based hardware subsidies to local sanitation providers for each slab or latrine sold (initially intended&#13;
                                    to cover 40% to 60% of hardware costs)&#13;
                                 · Public hardware subsidy: about US$20 per household (19% of hardware costs). This can be complemented by&#13;
                                    a substantial cross-subsidy from other workshop activities (selling cement slabs, renting out space, etc.).&#13;

 Effectiveness in the use        · Relatively low leverage ratio: 0.87 (partly due to relatively low cost of latrine)&#13;

 Poverty targeting               · no explicit poverty targeting: all potential customers assumed to be poor&#13;

      What worked?                      · Subsidies provided to the production workshops, based on sales figures, were an interesting attempt to&#13;
                                           bolster the supply chain. This was also more effective than providing subsidies to households, especially at&#13;

      well?                             · As a result, workshops are cash-strapped and cannot invest in adapting what they have on offer to current&#13;

     improved latrine) was around US$70.                                                             current set-up of the program, since detailed quantitative&#13;

     The program initially helped to set up these production&#13;

     form of providing output-based subsidies. The subsidies                                         last three decades largely due to the civil war, which lasted&#13;
     were intended to cover between 40% and 60% of produc-                                           from independence in 1975 until 1992. The war destroyed&#13;

&#13;
     6   The "community animators" were transferred to municipalities but effectively stopped promoting sanitation, which resulted in decreased interest in the product. Responsibility for&#13;
         paying production subsidies was transferred to provincial governments. Some provinces stopped giving the subsidies and others kept their level unchanged since 2000 while production&#13;
         costs have increased significantly. As a result, the workshops have had to carry out other income-generating activities in order to cross-subsidize slab and latrine production costs.&#13;

The PLM workshops have been left in a legal vacuum.&#13;
During the decentralization process, little thought was&#13;
given to what the PLM workshops were actually supposed&#13;
to do or where or how it should fit into the provincial struc-&#13;
ture. Following decentralization, their legal status was left&#13;
unclear. They are neither a fully funded public entity nor&#13;
a private company able to raise their own resources and&#13;
set tariffs for their services. In many workshops, the work-&#13;
ers have never had any type of work contract, thus leaving&#13;
them in limbo regarding social security, severance pay, etc.&#13;
However, in the few cases where municipal councils have&#13;
taken a proactive role in taking on the workshops, these are&#13;
still working well. This is a clear example of the need for&#13;
political will to implement effective sanitation programs.&#13;

      Note 1: The BALP only allows getting rid of gray water and is not a solution for elimination of human excreta.&#13;
      Note 2: As the CFAF is pegged to the Euro, it has appreciated against the US$ throughout the project period. For example, a toilet with septic tank cost CFAF 734,966 according to the&#13;
      project catalog. This was equivalent to US$1,054 at the start of the project in 2002 but rose to US$1,709 in 2008, which is equivalent to a 60% increase in US$ terms. For our purposes,&#13;
      CFAF costs were converted using 2005 average rate (1 US$= 528 CFAF), as this is the date by which all on-site sanitation facilities had been built. This exchange rate is close to the average&#13;

       What worked?               · The revolving fund proved highly sustainable, as the funds were revolved several times before being transferred&#13;
                                     back to the municipalities to allocate further.&#13;
                                  · The Women's union, a pervasive organization throughout the country with experience in microfinance, managed&#13;
                                     the scheme initiated by the local utilities.&#13;
                                  · lending procedures were attractive to borrowers, and the loans worked as a catalyst for the households to find&#13;
                                     additional financing and invest.&#13;
                                  · The creation of Savings and Credit groups was seen as critical to ensure repayment of the loans&#13;
                                     and regular saving contributions.&#13;
       What did not work          · The solutions built represent a high proportion of poor households' income and are not affordable to the poorest,&#13;
       so well?                      who were excluded from the scheme.&#13;

8   In addition, during Phase 2, some revolving funds provided loans for water supply investments. This was not allowed during Phase 1.&#13;
9  This subsidized rate has not been taken into account into the computation of the use of public funds, as the funds were provided as a grant to the project. Estimating the value of&#13;
   this subsidy would require putting a value on the public cost of capital, which goes beyond the scope of this project.&#13;
10 In Haiphong, savings were not compulsory, but capital repayments equivalent to 5% of the total loan had to be returned each month from the 5th month of the cycle. They were&#13;
   able to offer these conditions because the population was better-off in Haiphong, which meant that the credit risk was lower.&#13;

      A key difference between urban and rural settings is that in                                      The software costs vary depending on the acceptability&#13;
      low-density areas (typically rural areas), it is possible to build                                of the sanitation solution that is proposed. The intensity&#13;
      larger latrines (i.e. excavating a larger pit) so that they fill up                               of software activities to be conducted would depend on&#13;
      over a longer period. When full, the latrine can be moved to                                      prevalent hygiene practices in the region or country and&#13;
      another site, which would generate additional capital costs.6                                     the extent to which the proposed technical solution can be&#13;
                                                                                                        easily related to existing practices.&#13;
      By contrast, in high-density areas (typically peri-urban and&#13;
      urban areas), space is a rare commodity. There is a limit to                                      G.3 Financing sources for on-site sanitation&#13;

           cannot afford moving the latrine, it may lose access to a sustainable sanitation solution that they had obtained through a publicly funded project.&#13;

                                     · Is the subsidy provided in kind or in cash? If in kind, what is provided?&#13;
                                     · What are the cost components covered by the subsidy?&#13;
                                     · Is the subsidy for a basic level of service? Who pays the complement if a higher level of service is sought?&#13;
                                     · What are the criteria and procedure to follow to obtain a subsidy? Do the criteria aim to target the poor in&#13;

C. Evaluation of the program's performance                                                      case study to another. Each of the main questions (in the&#13;
This section will seek to evaluate the program's performance                                    blue box) should be answered in both a qualitative and&#13;
on the basis of a number of indicators, which have been                                         quantitative manner (with information on as many indica-&#13;
standardized in order to facilitate comparisons from one                                        tors that follow as possible for the quantitative part).&#13;
&#13;
 Efficacy (did the financing approach trigger investment?)&#13;
 · Total number of sanitation facilities built (e.g. latrine, sewer connection, etc... - it will be necessary to state these figures by type of&#13;
    sanitation facility built)&#13;
 · number of people receiving "adequate" sanitation services as a result of the program&#13;
 · number of villages having achieved "Open defecation Free" status (if applicable)&#13;
 · Percentage of sanitation facilities built that are still operating 5 years down the line (if the program does not have sufficient history,&#13;
    indicate the percentage of facilities deemed to still be in operation at the present time)&#13;
 · Indicators of household satisfaction: are they using the facilities and are they satisfied that they have improved their existence?&#13;
 Efficiency (was investment carried out at a reasonable cost?)&#13;
 · Average total costs / household served by the project / program&#13;
 · Average total costs / households in the served community (even if the household itself is not served, in order to capture potential&#13;
    externalities)&#13;
 · Average hardware costs / household served&#13;
 · Average "software" cost / household served&#13;
 · Total capital investment costs (hardware) as a percentage of average income and as a percentage of poor household annual income&#13;
 · Operating costs as a percentage of average monthly income and of poor monthly income&#13;
 Equity (effectiveness in reaching the poor)&#13;
 · Average income of population reached by the project vs. average income of overall population (also use median income if data is avail-&#13;
    able)&#13;
 · Qualitative assessment of:&#13;
    ­ Errors of exclusion (what percentage of the poor population did not obtain the subsidy?)&#13;
    ­ Errors of inclusion (what percentage of the population obtained the subsidy even though they&#13;
       are above the poverty threshold?)&#13;
 · Size of household overall contribution (including capital costs) vs. average income of poor household (as an indicator of affordability&#13;
    for the poor)&#13;
 · Size of household overall contribution (including capital costs) vs. average income of median household (as an indicator of affordability&#13;
    for median households)&#13;
 Financial sustainability&#13;
 · Cost recovery indicators: operating cost recovery, capital cost recovery and total project cost recovery (estimated as the percentage of&#13;
    non-subsidized funds covering actual costs)&#13;
 Scalability&#13;
 · number of unserved population (or household) vs. financing availability: how much would it cost to serve all unserved households/&#13;
    population (in the area of the program and in the country) with this sanitation solution? Compare this to the annual sanitation budget&#13;
    in the country, and to the annual public sector budget (give %)&#13;
 · Any evidence of spontaneous uptake of what the program offers or demand for expansion?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Note: in the case of projects / programs that span several areas or cities, the analysis should be disaggregated as much as possible and seek to use location-specific data (including in&#13;
terms of income or poverty levels).&#13;

      [C] Overall evaluation&#13;
          · Was the program considered to be a success overall?&#13;
            If sanitation was one element of a broader program,&#13;
            was the sanitation component considered to be a&#13;
            success? If not, why not?&#13;
          · Did the program reach the intended recipients?&#13;
            What (anecdotal) reflections do the program manag-&#13;
            ers have on how it actually evolved? Were they posi-&#13;
            tive spin-offs, unintended consequences, unforeseen&#13;
            barriers?&#13;
          · When both on-site sanitation and sewerage connec-&#13;
            tion were available, did users have the choice between&#13;
            those solutions or were areas planned to be serve&#13;
            differently by the program designers? How did the&#13;
            financing structure influence users' willingness to&#13;
            invest in either mode of service?&#13;
          · Based on a qualitative assessment, to which extent&#13;
            was the financing scheme a determinant of either&#13;
            success or failure of the particular program / proj-&#13;
            ect?&#13;
          · Was the financing scheme seen as a good match&#13;
            for the level of service and additional interventions&#13;
            provided?&#13;
          · Do you know of any parallel program that may have&#13;
            affected the results of the project / program under&#13;
            consideration (for example, if an NGO-led program&#13;
            has been providing "free facilities" whereas the&#13;
            program only provided credit)?&#13;

            Financing on-site sanitation for the poor :
            a six country comparative review and analysis
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The present study offers evidence on
            alternative financing approaches for on-site household
            sanitation from case studies in six countries: Bangladesh,
            Ecuador, India, Mozambique, Senegal, and Vietnam. This
            evidence can help identify the best-performing approaches
            and the relevant factors and issues to consider in designing
            a sanitation financing strategy. The study systematically
            compares alternative financing approaches based on a set of
            common indicators, including in terms of the effectiveness
            in the use of public funds and targeting. The team chose to
            focus on those projects recognized as successes to obtain a
            reasonable representation of the better practices in
            sanitation programs. The study identified a number of useful
            examples and tentative lessons about finance which should
            help to advance the design of sanitation finance at the
            outset of a project. Replicating such experiences will
            require a better understanding of what drives household
            investment and what the key constraints limiting such
            investment are, in both financial and non-financial terms.
            The sanitation challenge continues to grow with population,
            as does the cost of failing to meet it. This study is a
            worthwhile contribution to addressing the challenge of how
            to pay for sanitation.
