THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: East Asia &amp; Pacific&#13;
based on indicator sets that measure and benchmark&#13;
regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: Low income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 15,408,270&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 1,010&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 127&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 133*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 52.78&#13;

absolute terms, while the ease of doing business ranking       and the changes in methodology. See the data notes&#13;
can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;
                                                                 Submitting all relevant documents and&#13;
What do the indicators cover?                                    obtaining all necessary clearances and permits&#13;

as well as the time and cost to complete them. These             Obtaining external installation works and&#13;
procedures include applications and contracts with               possibly purchasing material for these works&#13;
electricity utilities, clearances from other agencies            Concluding any necessary supply contract and&#13;
and the external and final connection works. In                  obtaining final supply&#13;

        The consumer should obtain a clearance from the Distribution&#13;
        Department which has to assess whether EDC has enough capacity. The&#13;
        clearance is issued by the Managing Director of the Distribution&#13;

        kVA will be required. The external connection works are carried out by&#13;
        EDC.&#13;
        The meter gets installed at the same time as when the connection is&#13;
        done. If there is a road crossing it takes EDC additional 2 weeks to&#13;

        There is no supervision / inspection of the internal wiring before the final&#13;
        connection. EDC is responsible only for the external connection. The&#13;
        customer's private electrical engineer is in charge of the internal wiring.&#13;
        There is no requirement that the electrician must be licensed, so they can&#13;
        practice without a license. However, EDC is de facto the licensor of&#13;
        electrical engineers because they provide training courses. Attendees of&#13;
        this training receive a certificate that EDC recognizes. There is no other&#13;
        agency that provides the courses.&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;

The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

      Pay transfer tax at the Tax Collection Office&#13;
&#13;
      A transfer tax of 4% of value of the property is paid to the Ministry of&#13;
      Economy and Finance at the Tax Collection Office of the location of the&#13;
      transferred property. A Tax Receipt is issued to prove that the tax has&#13;
      been paid. The 4% transfer tax is set out in Article 40 of the Law on&#13;
      Finance for the year 1995. In Phnom Penh, this tax is not assessed based&#13;
      on the true transacted value of the property but based on a schedule of&#13;
      price of property determined by the Phnom Penh Municipality. The&#13;
      assessed value is usually based on the total number of square meters,                         4% of property&#13;

      the land's location, use etc. The tax is not based on the actual price for                  value (transfer fee)&#13;
      which the land is sold; rather it is based on the assessed value. For the&#13;
      land of more than 1200mÂ², the surplus is subject to unused land tax. For&#13;
      the land less than 1200mÂ², the unused land tax is not applicable. The&#13;
      time for the tax office to complete the calculation of transfer tax will&#13;
      depend on the location of the land and its size.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

Doing Business presents results for two aggregate             even though it is no longer at the frontier in a&#13;

doing business ranking, which is based on the distance&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

practice across the entire sample of 36 indicators for 10     extreme outliers in the distributions of the rescaled data&#13;
Doing Business topics (the labor market regulation            for most component indicators (very few economies&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;
score for the total tax rateâ&#128;&#148;and therefore on the&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Cambodia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Cambodia.
            To allow for useful comparison, the profile also provides
            data for other selected economies (comparator economies) for
            each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the 13th edition in a
            series of annual reports measuring the regulations that
            enhance business activity and those that constrain it.
            Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business; for
            2015 Cambodia ranks 127. A high ease of doing business
            ranking means the regulatory environment is more conducive
            to the starting and operation of a local firm. Doing
            Business presents quantitative indicators on business
            regulations and the protection of property rights that can
            be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan to
            Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business sheds light on how
            easy or difficult it is for a local entrepreneur to open and
            run a small to medium-size business when complying with
            relevant regulations. It measures and tracks changes in
            regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a
            business: starting a business, dealing with construction
            permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
            credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
            across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency
            and labor market regulation. The data in this report are
            current as of June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes
            indicators, which cover the period from January to December 2014).
