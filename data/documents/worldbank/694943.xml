HONDURAS&#13;
RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. COUNTRY OVERVIEW AND MACROECONOMIC BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   After a decade of slow economic growth, averaging 2.5 percent per annum, and mounting&#13;
fiscal and trade disequilibria, external debt, and market distortions, the Government of Honduras&#13;
(GOH) undertook a structural adjustment program in 1990, supported by the Second Structural&#13;
Adjustment Credit (3257-HO). Key elements of this market-oriented program were fiscal reform,&#13;
trade liberalization, removal of price controls, and liberalization of the foreign exchange system.&#13;
While some important progress was made during the 1990-94 administration and GDP improved&#13;
substantially, the administration left serious macro-economic imbalances unsolved.&#13;
1.2   The present Government, which took office in January 1994, had initial success in&#13;
addressing these imbalances. It completed the second year of an International Monetary Fund&#13;
(IMF) Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility program, but was then unable to agree with the&#13;
IMF on a third year program. It has also found it difficult to maintain progress in strengthening&#13;
fiscal policy, as a result of pressures surrounding the presidential primaries in November 1996 and&#13;
general elections scheduled for November 1997. Although the Government has taken some&#13;
revenue measures (raising gasoline taxes and telephone rates), further actions were needed and, in&#13;
this connection, a revised tax code is presently in Congress. These macro developments have&#13;
caused a delay in declaring effective the Public Sector Modernization Adjustment Credit. On the&#13;
other hand, the Government has continued to make progress with several of the structural reforms&#13;
supported by the Public Sector Modernization Adjustment Credit (especially in the areas of&#13;
employment rationalization, changes in the legal framework for telecommunications, legislation&#13;
permitting concessions, and modification of the Public Administration Law, setting the basis for&#13;
meaningful restructuring of public agencies). Growth is estimated to have decreased from 3.6&#13;
percent in 1995 to 3 percent in 1996. The IMF is continuing discussions with Government with&#13;
the aim of finalizing agreement on an economic program for 1997.&#13;
1.3   Government policy reforms have had an overall positive impact on the real incomes of the&#13;
rural poor. Between 1988 and 1993, the real incomes of agricultural workers grew at an average&#13;
annual rate of almost 10 percent and producer prices of major agricultural outputs also rose.&#13;
Despite this, much remains to be done to reduce widespread rural poverty. National household&#13;
surveys and World Bank studies indicate that about 78 percent of households in the poorest 30&#13;
percentile of the population are rural. Farms of less than 5 hectares accounted for 72 percent of&#13;
all farms in 1993, compared to 64 percent in 1974. A study on rural poverty in Honduras (June&#13;
29, 1995), supported by IDA, recommends increasing public investment in the rural sector by&#13;
disseminating market information and productive technologies to small farmers. The report also&#13;
notes that redressing the inequitable distribution of assets (especially land) is a critical need.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.4   Public sector reform would make an important contribution to reducing poverty in&#13;
Honduras. Altering the role of the government and reducing the size of the public sector and&#13;
state-owned enterprises could free public resources for investments in human resources and the&#13;
poor. The government has taken steps to reduce its size and promote private sector involvement&#13;
in providing public goods and services through its Public Sector Modernization Program. These&#13;
efforts are to be supported by an IDA Public Sector Modernization Structural Adjustment Credit&#13;
(6740-HO). Measures to reduce the Government's role in the economy are needed, as public&#13;
expenditures are well above average for both low- and middle- income countries, and employment&#13;
in the public sector still accounts for 8.2 percent of GDP.&#13;
1.5  In the agricultural and forestry sectors, important policy and institutional reforms were&#13;
embodied in the Agricultural Modernization Law (AML) of 1992, which was supported by the&#13;
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and IDA through an adjustment credit (AGSAC, Cr.&#13;
2540-HO). The AML reversed a 1974 law which dictated that the ownership, management and&#13;
use of forest land and trees came under Government purview. Under the AML, forest ownership&#13;
and appropriation rights were returned to the forest-land owner. The current law entrusts&#13;
Government with regulating, protecting and managing protected areas and national forests&#13;
through the Agriculture and Livestock Secretariat (SAG). In addition to redefining the role of the&#13;
SAG, the reform also streamlined other sector agencies, eliminating sub-agencies that duplicated&#13;
services and transferring important functions to the private sector. This included an attempt to&#13;
shift rural credit responsibilities from an inefficient government agricultural credit bank&#13;
(BANADESA) to credit societies and unions. Under the new framework, forest management&#13;
plans have been prepared in over 300 km2 of public forest-lands and protected areas, public timber&#13;
auctions have been held which have stimulated substantial increases in timber's market price, and&#13;
some 70 or more management plans have been approved in private and ejido forests (municipal&#13;
lands aliocated during the pre-independence period for communal use and urban expansion).&#13;
These are encouraging signs that in some areas forest management is becoming an increasingly&#13;
attractive alternative to agricultural conversion. Much remains to be done, nevertheless, this is a&#13;
positive beginning.&#13;
B. GovERNMENT POLICY, INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
Government Agencies and other Organizations&#13;
1.6   Under the AML, the SAG remains the lead government institution for agriculture and&#13;
forest sector policy and action. The SAG is comprised of: (a) the Economic Policy Unit (UPEG),&#13;
a planning and policy cell which was strengthened under AML to set policies of the formerly&#13;
autonomous land and forest agencies; (b) the State Forestry Agency (AFE-COHDEFOR), a semi-&#13;
autonomous forestry agency, which was formerly a para-statal corporation with manufacturing&#13;
and marketing responsibilities; (c) the National Agrarian Institute (INA), a semi-autonomous rural&#13;
land titling agency formerly burdened with rural development programs as well as land reform;&#13;
(d) the Directorate for Agricultural Science and Technology (DICTA), a semi-autonomous&#13;
agricultural research and extension agency which, among other responsibilities, sets criteria for&#13;
channeling government funds to small producers and research organizations; (e) a phyto-sanitary&#13;
directorate; and (f) the Department of Rural Development (DDR), a small directorate established&#13;
to assist marginal farmers which has yet to be given a clear mandate or work program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.7   Other agencies involved in the rural sector are: (a) the Commission on Agricultural&#13;
Development (CODA), an advisory committee consisting of agency heads and SAG, which was&#13;
formed to ensure that the sector maintains a consistent policy direction; (b) the National Council&#13;
for Agricultural Technology Generation and Transfer (CONACTA), a public/private sector&#13;
council established to coordinate the country's new National Research and Technology Transfer&#13;
System (SNITTA); (c) the Economic Cabinet; and (d) the Technical Advisory Committee&#13;
(CONAPH) of the National Environment Advisory Council (COCONA), which comprises&#13;
DAPVS, the new Secretariat of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA), SAG, and&#13;
academic and non-governmental institutions and is responsible for setting policy related to&#13;
protected areas and biodiversity.&#13;
1.8   Land administration is the responsibility of a number of institutions. The Property&#13;
Registry (PR), an entity under the control of the Supreme Court, records deeds and transactions.&#13;
INA grants titles to farmers settled on lands legally described as "agricultural vocation" lands.&#13;
The Department of Cadastre (DEC), an autonomous institute recently moved from the Planning&#13;
Ministry to the Ministry of the Presidency, sets standards for legal surveys. Municipalities are&#13;
responsible for maintaining legal cadastres within their boundaries in return for taxation authority,&#13;
and the National Geography Institute (IGN) sets mapping standards.&#13;
1.9   Honduras also has an NGO sector active in small-farmer development and watershed&#13;
management, which has provided a wealth of experience on low-cost, effective extension methods&#13;
and management practices to increase productivity on small farms while controlling and even&#13;
reversing soil degradation. Several bilaterally-funded projects have attempted to extend this&#13;
experience, but these efforts have been impeded by limited institutional capacity and the low&#13;
priority assigned by government to sustaining these initiatives following termination of external&#13;
financing. In some instances the Protected Areas and Wildlife Department (DAPVS) has&#13;
successfully experimented with joint protected areas management, whereby important&#13;
management and eco-tourism roles have been transferred to locally-based NGOs and community&#13;
groups, thus enhancing protection and management within the limited capacity of the public&#13;
sector. Other rural sector entities to note are producers' organizations (found primarily among&#13;
farmers with better quality land) and a federation of forestry cooperatives organized around&#13;
industrial and community forestry, particularly resin collection.&#13;
Policy and Legislation&#13;
1.10  Under the reform process, the Government has established a new policy framework which&#13;
consists of several complementary laws and regulations: (a) the AML, which guides policy for the&#13;
sector as a whole; (b) the Municipal Law of 1991, which devolves responsibilities for maintaining&#13;
cadastre records, managing ejido forests and decision-making to the municipal level while&#13;
increasing budget transfers from central government; (c) the Property Registry Law of 1987,&#13;
which mandates that the personal property registry be replaced by folio real (a parcel-based&#13;
system in which physical cadastral infornation is overlaid with a consistent legal register of that&#13;
parcel--Annex B); (d) the Environmental Law, which creates a system of Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment and assigns an oversight role to the Natural Resources and Environment Secretariat&#13;
(SERNA) for biodiversity conservation and land-use zoning; (e) the Public Sector Reform&#13;
Program (and accompanying draft General Law of Public Administration), which continues the&#13;
process of down-sizing and streamlining agriculture sector agencies; and (f) the Forest Incentives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Law of 1993, which approves incentives for forestation and forest management to encourage&#13;
private and community tree plantation, agro-forestry and forest regeneration.&#13;
C. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
Country Specific Lessons&#13;
1.11  IDA/World Bank projects in Honduras have often experienced problems due to weak&#13;
institutions and budgetary constraints for counterpart financing. These problems have been&#13;
avoided in the Honduran Social Investment Fund (FHIS) lending programs (Credit No. 2212-HO.&#13;
-February 1991, Credit No. 2401-HO, May 1992, and Credit No 14181-HO, June 16, 1995) by&#13;
channeling resources through an autonomous agency and allowing it to operate free of&#13;
government administrative regulations and salary constraints. In light of this, the proposed&#13;
project would: (a) establish a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) reporting directly to the Minister&#13;
level (thus placing it above the Secretariat's own executing agencies) to channel external&#13;
resources to participating government agencies and to oversee procurement and disbursement&#13;
activities; (b) channel resources for upland development directly to beneficiaries by means of an&#13;
agricultural research and extension fund, to be managed by a private sector contractor; and&#13;
(c) include institutional development measures to increase the capacity of executing agencies in&#13;
the private and public sectors.&#13;
Sector Lessons&#13;
1. 12 Land Administration. A World Bank report on the experiences of 12 rural titling&#13;
projects revealed that investments performed well under the following conditions; (a) where the&#13;
project had political support and government was committed to providing resources to the&#13;
project; (b) where implementation capacity existed; (c) where there existed a comprehensive,&#13;
modem system of land administration, which combined reliable physical and legal cadastral&#13;
information; and (d) where project objectives were consistent with the overall policy&#13;
environment.' Analyzing the proposed project in light of these prerequisites, it is clear that the&#13;
project has both the commitment and political support of the Government, as evidenced by the&#13;
creation of an active, inter-agency land modernization commission and the establishment of a PPF.&#13;
With regard to implementation capacity, however, the necessary conditions are not fully met, and&#13;
the design of the project has been tailored to allow for existing weaknesses. Given the lack of a&#13;
modem registry system with reliable data, the proposed project will not carry out cadastral or land&#13;
titling activities before modernizing the system within which information is generated and&#13;
maintained. In addition, the land administration activities themselves have been phased to allow&#13;
for adjustments based on pilot experiences and to fit current and projected institutional capacity.&#13;
1.13  Natural Resources Management. World Bank experience demonstrates that there are&#13;
three fundamental areas where a Forest Department must have information in order to begin&#13;
effective forest management. They must know: (a) where the forest is located; (b) what the forest&#13;
resources are; and (c) the trends in forest use. AFE-COHDEFOR, is still in the process of&#13;
establishing this knowledge base. The natural resources management component of the proposed&#13;
project is thus targeted at building up this knowledge and the capacity to use and maintain it. It&#13;
1See World Bank, Research and Policy Division Working Paper No. 1992-3 5, March, 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
seeks to accomplish this through practical exercises involving planning, training, execution and&#13;
follow-up. World Bank experience has also shown the value of building local capacity to engage&#13;
in forest and watershed management and in land conservation. The project proposes to bring&#13;
local populations and their organizations into the discussion of resources management and to&#13;
finance training and technical assistance to increase local capacity in this activity. Specifically, the&#13;
project would build on the positive experiences in forestry from the Canadian International&#13;
Development Agency (CIDA) and the Finnish Development Authority (FINNIDA), which have&#13;
developed models to organize settlers and municipal members into small entrepreneurial units to&#13;
log and manage selected forest areas. The project would also seek to mainstream these models&#13;
within AFE/COHDEFOR's normal functions, working with field offices to upgrade professional&#13;
skills, improve forest information systems and develop new forest management standards and&#13;
regulations.&#13;
1.14  Support to Poor Upland Farmers. Experience in Honduras indicates that poor farmers&#13;
working on marginal lands can increase agricultural productivity and incomes and improve their&#13;
land use. Successful projects have been linked to the following factors: (a) employing technically&#13;
competent NGOs tc provide extension services; (b) using participatory training and extension&#13;
methods; (c) encouraging on-going adaptation and gradual innovation on the part of farmers,&#13;
focusing on a limited number of priority activities; and (d) focusing on the human resources of the&#13;
farmer by increasing motivation and promoting self-sufficiency. Lessons from the FHIS projects&#13;
also demonstrate that targeting resources to the poor can be effective when processes are&#13;
transparent and beneficiaries are involved in project planning from the outset. Following this&#13;
experience, project preparation has relied on extensive consultation with potential beneficiaries&#13;
and NGOs; and it would establish an independent fund for productive activities, to be accessed&#13;
directly by upland small-scale producers (both in forest management and small farm production&#13;
systems), using NGOs, producer organizations and municipalities as intermediary service&#13;
providers.&#13;
1.15  Biodiversity Conservation. Lessons from World Bank financed projects containing&#13;
biodiversity components reveal a number of key social, political and economic factors determining&#13;
project success.2 Successful projects were linked to: (a) institutional strengthening, including staff&#13;
training, infrastructure, equipment and improved management systems; (b) participation of local&#13;
stake-holders to gain commitment and ownership; (c) financial sustainability of protected areas,&#13;
particularly for recurrent costs; (d) flexibility in implementation to allow the project to adapt to&#13;
lessons learned; and (e) decentralized management of protected areas to increase efficiency and&#13;
develop local capacity. The project responds to these issues by: developing self-financing&#13;
mechanisms; working in consultation with local organizations and NGOs; setting aside funds to&#13;
study traditional land uses within protected areas; establishing protected blocks within selected&#13;
national priority areas (six to ten areas of thirty forest plots each); and providing funds for&#13;
capacity building at the local level.&#13;
1.16  Gender. In addressing gender issues, the project draws on documented experiences from&#13;
neighboring Central American countries, which indicate that a gender perspective changes the&#13;

scope and economic potential of forestry and agriculture interventions. In El Salvador, for&#13;
example, gender roles and dynamics have affected the outcomes of fuel-wood and reforestation&#13;
initiatives because of men's and women's conflicting views over the use of wood. The El&#13;
Salvador Agriculture Sector Reform and Investment Project (Loan No. 10933-ES) and the&#13;
Nicaragua Agricultural Technology and Land Management Project (Loan No. 11802-NI) have&#13;
shown that positive outcomes can be achieved by including a gender perspective during project&#13;
design. Hence, the proposed project establishes targeted extension and training programs for&#13;
women.&#13;
D. COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
1.17 IDA's Country Assistance Strategy for Honduras dates back to July 14, 1993 and was&#13;
discussed with the Board on August 5, 1993. The next CAS will be produced in early 1998 to&#13;
coincide with the political cycle. At that time the strategy would be up-dated and would&#13;
concentrate on helping the Government attain its three medium-term objectives: (a) reducing&#13;
poverty; (b) modernizing the economy and the public sector and creating a favorable environment&#13;
for private sector development; and (c) managing the country's natural resources more effectively.&#13;
These goals would by reached by: carrying out economic, social, and sector analyses focused on&#13;
structural, sectoral and institutional issues; building institutional capacity in the public sector;&#13;
mobilizing concessional funding for economic and social programs; and developing a lending&#13;
portfolio focused on policy-based sector rehabilitation and investment operations. IFC has a&#13;
potential role to play in facilitating the transition from public sector to private sector services in&#13;
areas such as electricity, telecommunications and port/airports. IDA would continue to work&#13;
closely with the IDB and the IMF on sensitive reform programs to minimize conflicting policy&#13;
advice and increase aid mobilization for reform operations.&#13;
2.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN&#13;
2.1   During preparation of the AGSAC, the Government requested future IDA and IDB&#13;
assistance in implementing the agreed policy reforms. The Government specifically asked for help&#13;
in: (a) putting large areas of national forest under active management and reducing pressures on&#13;
priority watersheds and biodiversity areas; (b) promoting effective research and extension for&#13;
small farmers living on productive lands and for those settled on marginal uplands; and&#13;
(c) modernizing the land administration system. In 1994, IDA sent several fact-finding missions&#13;
to evaluate problems and opportunities, and in December 1994 a workshop was held with key&#13;
agencies to identify a potential project. The December workshop identified a range of problems&#13;
and potential programs which were subsequently assigned priority for a proposed project at a&#13;
second workshop in May 1995.&#13;
2.2   One component, land administration, was not addressed comprehensively in the AGSAC,&#13;
because land issues were handled by a number of different agencies with no clear cross-agency&#13;
coordinating mechanism. Thus the Supreme Court convened an inter-institutional commission-&#13;
made up of the Supreme Court itself, the Property Registry, INA, DEC, and UPSA (now&#13;
UPEG)-to study land administration policy. This commission visited Argentina, Peru and Costa&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
Rica to discuss their experiences in modernizing land administration. The study tour was the first&#13;
step in developing a strategy for a more systematic and reliable land registry system based on a&#13;
folio real, the system currently mandated by law but as yet not implemented.&#13;
2.3   In October 1995, 1DB expressed interest in funding technology generation and extension&#13;
for farmers in areas of commercial potential and an institutional strengthening program for&#13;
DICTA. As a result, a decision was made to separate the project into two: an IDB-financed&#13;
project focused as above, and an IDA-financed project focused on land administration and natural&#13;
resources management. The preparation team also explored the feasibility of preparing an&#13;
associated GEF project to focus on sites within the Meso-American Biological Corridor to&#13;
complement an emerging component of protected areas management. The GEF Secretariat&#13;
approved a Project Preparation and Development Facility (PDF) grant of $300,000 in January&#13;
1996 to assist in preparing a joint UNDP/lDA biodiversity conservation program in the Honduran&#13;
portion of the Meso-American Biological Corridor. Preparation should be completed later this&#13;
year, and a formal funding request will be submitted to the GEF Council for approval as part of&#13;
the inter-session work program in early 1997.&#13;
B. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.4   The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy for Honduras, as&#13;
noted above. This strategy gives priority to poverty alleviation, public sector modernization and&#13;
sustainable environmental and natural resources management, the latter within the framework of&#13;
implementing the AML. Specific approaches to environmentally sustainable development include:&#13;
(a) natural resources management, including forestry; (b) conserving biodiversity; (c) reducing&#13;
destruction of marine resources; (d) gaining a consensus on priority areas; and (e) strengthening&#13;
the legal and institutional framework, including land tenure. Each of these approaches, except&#13;
the one related to marine resources, is an important part of the proposed project.&#13;
2.5   IDA is in a unique position to support the activities in the proposed project, given its key&#13;
role under the AGSAC in assisting the Government with drafting the AML and with its initial&#13;
implementation. Planned land administration modernization activities are intended to build long-&#13;
term government institutional capacity to establish and maintain information on land and forest&#13;
rights. Land activities move beyond land titling within the AGSAC context to modernize the&#13;
cadastral system and the Property Registry. The modernization draws upon the experience with&#13;
other recent World Bank and IDA-assisted projects in the region. The forest management, upland&#13;
producer technology support, and biodiversity conservation activities provide investment&#13;
resources to consolidate AGSAC-related reforms. They will foster greater integration of social&#13;
and environmental concerns into forest and upland management, and improve technical&#13;
soundness, drawing upon lessons from earlier experience.&#13;
2.6   As mentioned earlier, the macro-economic situation facing Honduras is difficult. Despite&#13;
this, there are good reasons for proceeding with the proposed project. Not only is it important to&#13;
maintain the momentum of the AGSAC by providing investment resources, but Honduras' long-&#13;
term development priorities (rural poverty alleviation, land administration, natural resources&#13;
management), as embodied in the proposed project, will remain a fundamental part of IDA's&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy in future. The next CAS is scheduled to coincide with the next&#13;
political cycle, with Board discussion in early 1998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.7   The proposed Honduras Rural Land Management Project would focus on important&#13;
forested areas and on pilot municipalities. Its objectives would be to: (a) modernize the system of&#13;
rural land registration, laying a foundation for more effective land titling; (b) strengthen the forest&#13;
administration of AFE-COHDEFOR in its new normative role and promote participation of local&#13;
populations in managing their natural resources; (c) improve agriculture and forestry practices in&#13;
upland farms to stabilize income and thereby decrease forest encroachment; and (d) rationalize the&#13;
national protected areas system, putting representative areas of the nation's ecosystems under&#13;
management for their conservation.&#13;
2.8   The project would address the following key problems: (a) the limited access of poor&#13;
upland farmers and forest producers in marginal areas to improved technology and extension;&#13;
(b) the country's antiquated system of registering and titling forest and agricultural land and its&#13;
lack of a parcel-based records system; (c) conflicting claims to land title between small-scale&#13;
farmers, agrarian reform enterprises, indigenous groups and farmers engaged in community&#13;
forestry; (d) the weak institutional capacity of INA, DEC, AFE/COHDEFOR and DICTA, and&#13;
the lack of coordination between them; (e) the poor capacity of local organizations to manage&#13;
forest resources; and (f) the lack of systematic land use planning.&#13;
D. PROJFCT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.9   The proposed project would finance a five-year program with two components:&#13;
(a) Land Administration Modernization, to test and install a land administration modernization&#13;
system based onfolio real), focusing on the Departments of Comayagua, Cortes, Yoro, Olancho&#13;
and Francisco de Morazan. These departments have the greatest potential for agricultural and&#13;
forest sector development, and also experience a high incidence of land conflict. (b) Natural&#13;
Resources Management, to be implemented in priority public forest blocks (as defined by AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR) in the Departments of Yoro, Olancho and Francisco Moraz6n. This component&#13;
would finance: (i) forest management with local participation; (ii) improved upland agriculture&#13;
and forestry, building capacity in producer organizations and NGOs; and (iii) management of key&#13;
protected areas and design of strategies for self-financing in the protected areas system. The&#13;
work in protected areas would go beyond the priority public forest blocks to (two to four)&#13;
additional sites with ecosystems important to the Meso-American Biological Corridor.&#13;
Component 1. Land Administration Modernization&#13;
2.10  The projectwould finance a modem system of land administration, based onfolio real, in&#13;
which cadastral information would be maintained at a local level, as defined by the jurisdiction of&#13;
each registry unit. It would aim to increase security of land and forest tenure and to begin&#13;
resolving tenure conflicts on forest lands. In doing this, it would provide a basis for increased&#13;
productivity and improved management of natural resources in rural areas and it would also&#13;
increase the level of environmental protection. In urban areas and in small rural communities&#13;
(aldeas and caserios) surveys and legal investigation would be carried out to provide the&#13;
municipal authorities with the necessary data to allow proper land adjudication under the Law of&#13;
Municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
2.11  Implementation would be in two distinct phases, comprising five separate activities.&#13;
Phase 1 (pilot) would finance US$2.2 million total costs: (a) the creation of a pilot land&#13;
information base; and (b) background analysis and participatory field adjudication of property&#13;
rights. Phase 2 (expansion) would finance US$10.8 million total costs: (a) improved registry&#13;
services in decentralized registry offices; (b) training of the employees and consultant staff of the&#13;
federal and municipal institutions involved; and (c) a catalogue of national and municipal forest&#13;
areas entered into the PR. Expansion of activities in the second phase would be conditioned&#13;
against the satisfactory implementation of the critical actions indicated in the joint plan resulting&#13;
from the evaluation of the pilot phase.&#13;
Component 2. Natural Resources Management&#13;
2.12 This component would have three sub-components, as described in Annexes C, D and E:&#13;
(a) Natural Forest Management, to strengthen the capacity of AFE-COHDEFOR and local&#13;
communities to manage natural forests; (b) a Fund for Upland Producers, to provide technical&#13;
assistance, training and research for better management of uplands (laderas); and (c) Biodiversity&#13;
Protection.&#13;
Natural Forest Management (ref. Annex C)&#13;
2.13  US$12.2 million total costs would be targeted to: (a) institutional development, especially&#13;
strengthening the capacity of AFE-COHDEFOR at the local level to manage national forests and&#13;
respond to community needs; and (b) sustainable forest resources management, especially building&#13;
the capacity of local groups and municipalities to manage forest resources and supporting applied&#13;
research in natural forest management. These activities would be executed in stages, and they&#13;
would build on experiences of a number of pilot projects already carried out in Honduras&#13;
(financed inter alia by CIDA, USAID, GTZ, FINNIDA, WWF, UNDP, NORAD and Norwegian&#13;
aid). The proposed project would aim to cover eleven forest management blocks (unidades de&#13;
gesti6n) and 22 priority micro-watersheds within the forest units. It is expected that the&#13;
management activities in these forest areas would provide lessons on expanding the pilot&#13;
experience to larger areas within the policy guidelines of the AML. The project experience should&#13;
in turn influence other donor-assisted initiatives in adjacent forests and foster more consistency in&#13;
AFE-COHDEFOR's overall program of decentralization.&#13;
2.14 Institutional Development. In accordance with agreements reached under AGSAC, the&#13;
project would finance the continuing decentralization of AFE-COHDEFOR functions and flow of&#13;
funds to the regions and field units initiated under the AGSAC. This would include:&#13;
(a) establishment of an in-house training program for AFE-COHDEFOR staff in natural forest&#13;
management and administration; (b) logistical and infrastructure support to field units and&#13;
regional offices in the form of standardized equipment packages; (c) information systems to allow&#13;
for effective decision making and monitoring of natural resources; and (d) technical assistance,&#13;
related to project implementation and specific critical subjects related to natural forest&#13;
management. Priority areas for technical assistance would include: upgrading administrative&#13;
systems and procedures (e.g., personnel, budgeting, supervision, development of operational&#13;
manuals); usufruct/tenure options and instruments for regularizing rights of forest occupants and&#13;
operating a social forestry program; cost/benefit analysis and recommendations for modifying&#13;
forest charges and regulatory costs; development of technical norms and regulations; and&#13;
implementing an improved environmental system of private and ejido forest regulation for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
bureaucratic efficiency and reasonable control. A plan for decentralized functions and flow of&#13;
funds in AFE-COHDEFOR has been agreed at negotiations.&#13;
2.15  Sustainable Forest Resources Management. The project would support AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR and local communities in forest tenure, regulation and forest management.&#13;
Activities would be initiated in seven priority forest blocks. Expansion of activities to four&#13;
additional forest blocks would be conditioned on satisfactory implementation of the critical&#13;
actions indicated in the mid-term review. The following main areas of assistance would be&#13;
included:&#13;
(a)   Forest Tenure and Usufruct. The objective would be to clarify the location and&#13;
status (legal and customary usage) of national forest lands and their occupants.&#13;
Investments would consist of: (i) mounting and maintaining a permanent database&#13;
(Catdlogo de Patrimonio Forestal Inalienable) of all legal information on the&#13;
official limits of national forest lands, holdings and tenure status (forest and land);&#13;
(ii) a census of national forests occupants (11 FMUs) plus participatory rural&#13;
diagnostics to verify census accuracy and identify length of occupancy, traditional&#13;
uses and perceptions of rights held by forest occupants; (iii) regularization of the&#13;
traditional rights of occupants of national forest lands, including mechanisms for&#13;
negotiation and conflict resolution; and (iv) delimitation and demarcation of 1,400&#13;
km of national forest boundaries.&#13;
(b)   Forest Planning. The project would finance planning for forest protection and&#13;
management within the 11 project FMUs, including: (i) environmental impact&#13;
assessments and protection plans for approximately 545,000 ha; and&#13;
(ii) silvicultural treatment plans for approximately 120,000 ha.&#13;
(c)   Forest Inventory. In production pine forests, the project would finance: (i) FMU-&#13;
level forest inventories for approximately 300,000 ha; (ii) stand-level inventories&#13;
for approximately 150,000 ha; and (iii) annual operating plan inventory and&#13;
marking activities (for silvicultural treatments and harvesting) for approximately&#13;
150,000 ha.&#13;
(d)   Promotion, Participation, and Public Consultation. The project would aim for&#13;
transparency in state decision-making regarding public forest lands. Investments&#13;
for this purpose would consist of: (i) dissemination of information on public forest&#13;
management objectives, plans and activities in public forests; (ii) public seminars&#13;
(85 total) on topics of importance to communities, municipalities, industry and&#13;
private forest owners regarding legal, environmental, social and technical aspects&#13;
of forest resources management; (iii) public awareness campaigns on forest fire,&#13;
illegal logging and private forest management options; (iv) municipal-level public&#13;
consultations (25 total) on forest management plans; and (v) community-level&#13;
public consultations (60 total) on forest management plans and annual operating&#13;
plans.&#13;
(e)   Forest Management. The project would finance: (i) forest fire control (including&#13;
a system of fire watch towers) for approximately 545,000 ha; (ii) forest vigilance&#13;
for approximately 545,000 ha; (iii) silvicultural treatments for approximately&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
120,000 ha; (iv) implementation of timber auction plans for approximately 30,000&#13;
ha; (v) implementation of protection plans in 7 protected areas; and (vi) forest road&#13;
improvements/rehabilitation on 45 km of forest roads.&#13;
(f)    Forest Research would include data collection, analysis and presentation of&#13;
findings from permanent sample plots in support of upgrading technical&#13;
prescriptions for sustainable harvesting of forest products.&#13;
Fund for Upland Producers (Annex D)&#13;
2.16 US$7.2 million total costs would be applied to the Fund for Upland Producers, which&#13;
would support improved natural resources management in agriculture and livestock; natural&#13;
forests and micro-watersheds. It would reach approximately 6,500 households over the life of the&#13;
project and would finance: (a) technical assistance and training for upland farmers and&#13;
municipalities; (b) applied research in support of agriculture, livestock and natural forest&#13;
management for upland areas; and (c) training of natural resources professionals who provide&#13;
technical services to upland farmers.&#13;
2.17 Details of the technical assistance, training and research programs which would be eligible&#13;
for financing from the fund are given in Annex D. Eligible activities would include (a) extension&#13;
services (technicians, para-technicians, extension materials and operational expenses);&#13;
(b) agriculture and forestry inputs for communal/municipal nurseries and the initial introduction of&#13;
plant germplasm for conservation and soil fertility management (seed, vegetative material,&#13;
germplasm, simple agricultural tools, and agro-chemical); (c) costs of certain legal procedures&#13;
(such as assistance to organizations in obtaining legal status and usufruct contracts); (d) applied&#13;
research in small-scale (community) natural forest management, non-traditional species utilization,&#13;
hill-slope agriculture technology (soil and moisture conservation and soil fertility management),&#13;
improved small-scale livestock management and integrated pest management (IPM); and&#13;
(e) training courses, seminars and workshops for natural resources professionals, focusing on&#13;
technical aspects of natural resources management (hill-slope production systems and natural&#13;
forest management) and on methodological aspects of extension and participatory diagnostics,&#13;
planning and evaluation.&#13;
2.18  Financing of technical assistance and training from the fund would be in the form of grants&#13;
to private technical assistance providers, based on contracts established between SAG, these&#13;
entities and farmers, or communities and municipalities in the upland areas. Financing of applied&#13;
research would be channeled through eligible institutions and entities which are members of the&#13;
National Research and Technology Transfer System (SNITTA). Priorities would be set through a&#13;
series of consultations in which the national research policy entity (CONACTA) would&#13;
participate.&#13;
2.19  The fund would be treated from the outset as a pilot, to be reviewed and amended at the&#13;
first review exercise which would be held at the end of the second year of the project. Further&#13;
amendment may be needed at the formal mid-term review during the third year of the project. At&#13;
the beginning of the project, activities requiring funding would include: (a) completion of the&#13;
procedures manual, including preliminary testing of design and adjustments; (b) setting up a roster&#13;
of experienced consultants and a management information system; (c) research and training&#13;
prioritization exercise (i.e., series of consultations and workshops with clients and end-users);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(d) establishment of the Fund Secretariat; and (e) contracting of a Fund Manager. At present,&#13;
IDB has agreed to finance (d) and (e) out of the complementary Agricultural Technology Project.&#13;
Biodiversity Conservation (Annex E)&#13;
2.20 US$5.8 million total costs would be targeted for biodiversity conservation in protected&#13;
areas. This sub-component would strengthen existing SINAPH (National Protected Areas&#13;
System) areas of national and international significance within COHDEFOR. The component&#13;
would be complemented by an associated GEF grant (under preparation jointly with UNDP).&#13;
Within the overall regional priorities of the Meso-American Biological Corridor, the proposed&#13;
IDA project would finance management of those priority sites with outstanding economic&#13;
potential (eco-tourism) judged to be capable of being financially self-sufficient, while the proposed&#13;
GEF grant would finance management of those sites with the highest biodiversity value. The&#13;
proposed GEF Biodiversity Conservation Project would include: (a) institutional strengthening;&#13;
(b) investments similar to the ones financed under the proposed IDA credit for seven protected&#13;
areas in the biological corridor, including one visitor center; (c) buffer zone investments; and&#13;
(d) monitoring.&#13;
2.21 National Priority Setting for SINAPH. A map of Honduran ecosystems is being&#13;
prepared partially with PPF and GEF preparation funds to help analyze the "representativity" of&#13;
the existing SINAPH areas, along with a gap-analysis (i.e. identification of ecosystems under-&#13;
represented or absent in the SINAPH). Through this project and the proposed GEF grant,&#13;
SERNA and the Protected Areas Agency, DAPVS, would host a series of consultations to&#13;
evaluate the current protected areas system, identify gaps in this coverage and any deterioration in&#13;
areas which may change their conservation priority. National consensus for a rationalized&#13;
SINAPH would be sought through a consultative process, and these priorities would be approved&#13;
in dialogue with concerned municipalities and their residents. It is not anticipated that during the&#13;
life of the project any current SINAPH areas would be de-gazetted or suffer a change in legal&#13;
protection status. Nor is this an objective of the exercise. The basic objective is to ensure that&#13;
there is an adequately defined SINAPH, fully representing biodiversity and landscape values and&#13;
that it has a well-defined set of priorities to allow rational decisions to be made in protected area&#13;
management.&#13;
2.22  Preliminary Selection. In the absence of a national consensus on a rationalized SINAPH,&#13;
it was agreed with GOH that the IDA project would focus investments on areas which retain&#13;
significant portions of their natural habitats or have outstanding income generation potential or for&#13;
the presence of high-profile species. There is a high degree of certainty that in a rationalized&#13;
SINAPH these "core areas" would still maintain a top priority status. To identify these areas,&#13;
reconnaissance flights and field inspections were carried out that covered almost all 107 protected&#13;
areas. Areas with more than 90 percent unaltered vegetation in their core areas and with little or&#13;
no permnanent habitations were considered to qualify as core areas. Areas with less than 75&#13;
percent natural vegetation and considerable human presence in their core areas were considered to&#13;
qualify as areas of regional biodiversity potential. The latter would also have additional values for&#13;
other management objectives, such as multiple use, watershed management or forestry programs.&#13;
Five areas which fell in between these categories need further investigation. Based on this&#13;
analysis, sixteen areas or clusters of areas were identified that could constitute the core&#13;
management units of largely pristine habitat. Additionally, two cave sites were included as natural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
monuments for their visitation potential and some few beach sites in the Gulf of Fonseca to&#13;
protect marine turtle nesting sites.&#13;
2.23  Investments in Protected Areas. The IDA project will focus on those priority sites&#13;
within the SINAPH with outstanding value for eco-tourism development while the GEF will focus&#13;
on those sites with the highest biodiversity value. This IDA project sub-component would finance&#13;
infrastructure and equipment to: (a) establish in three high interest protected areas (PAs) visitor&#13;
centers of international standing, including interpretation programs and nature trails; and&#13;
(b) upgrade seven existing areas with duty stations and basic administrative centers for&#13;
management staff and rangers, trails or access roads to duty stations, vehicles, motorcycles,&#13;
horses, and radios for communications to and within protected areas.&#13;
2.24 Management Planning and Demarcation. Under this sub-component, management&#13;
plans and demarcation activities would be prepared for at least two high-interest PAs being&#13;
funded.&#13;
2.25   Self-financing Mechanism and Coverage of Recurrent Costs. This sub-component&#13;
would consist of: (a) the creation of a fund (fideicomiso) to administer income from entry fees&#13;
charged at visitor centers and possibly income from other sources, to be managed by a&#13;
commercial bank, which would handle entry fees, make all payments to the PAs that qualify under&#13;
a pre-established set of rules (salaries and maintenance of equipment and infrastructure).&#13;
Assuming continuing government funding of the SINAPH at current levels, it is expected that the&#13;
fund would be self-supporting for the core areas by the third year of the project; (b) institutional&#13;
strengthening (hiring of personnel) of the unit for the management and administration of the core&#13;
protected areas; (c) recurrent costs of vehicles and equipment in the first two years (until income&#13;
generated from entry fees at the visitor centers takes over). Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that GOH would ensure adequate budget for the incremental protected areas staff to&#13;
be recruited and their expenses, should the Protected Areas Fund not generate the expected&#13;
resources to cover these costs.&#13;
2.26  Training. The project would finance training of staff to implement the self-financing&#13;
mechanism, to manage and protect the core areas, and to work with visitors and local&#13;
communities.&#13;
Project Coordinating Unit (PCU)&#13;
2.27 The PCU would be responsible for the overall management of the proposed project. PCU&#13;
financing would be used for: (a) planning and monitoring of project budgetary resources;&#13;
(b) processing disbursement, procurement of goods and services, and carrying out technical&#13;
audits; (c) monitoring and supervision; (d) evaluation and special studies in land management,&#13;
agricultural technology and natural resources; (e) training of PCU staff; and (f) office equipment.&#13;
E. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES&#13;
2.28  The proportion of the poor among project beneficiaries is expected to be significantly&#13;
larger than their proportion in the overall population, and therefore this project fits the criteria for&#13;
inclusion in the Program of Targeted Interventions. The project belongs primarily to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Environmentally Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction and Human Resources&#13;
Development Program Objective Categories.&#13;
F. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
2.29   Total project costs including contingencies and taxes are estimated at about US$41.8&#13;
million equivalent, (see Table 1, below). Baseline costs are estimated at US$38.1 million and&#13;
physical contingencies at US$1.4 million, or 4 percent of total baseline costs, including a Project&#13;
Preparation Facility of US$2 million. Price contingencies were estimated at US$2.3 million, or&#13;
about 6 percent of baseline costs plus physical contingencies. Annual price increases were applied&#13;
to foreign costs in all categories in US dollar terms at a rate of 2.6 percent, assuming purchasing&#13;
power parity during the five-year disbursement period.&#13;

Note: Due to rounding, totals may not add precisely.&#13;
2.30 The proposed IDA credit of US$34.0 million equivalent would finance 81 percent of total&#13;
costs excluding taxes and duties. Foreign exchange accounts for 23 percent of the proposed costs&#13;
of the project. IDA would cover an amount equivalent to the total amount of foreign exchange&#13;
costs (US$9.1 million) plus US$24.9 million of the local costs (excluding taxes).&#13;
G. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
2.31   GOH Counterpart Funding. The GOH is experiencing severe financial constraints,&#13;
and recent salary adjustments for all public servants and debt service payments leave little room&#13;
for accommodating new commitments. However, the proposed project would implement&#13;
activities which are of high priority for GOH in its attempt to stimulate economic growth.&#13;
Furthermore, the Natural Resources Management component, the largest part of the Project, is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
directly targeted at a potentially highly productive sector -- forestry. The income generated&#13;
during the life of the project from stumpage fees in the project area alone would be between&#13;
US$30 million and US$45 million, more than adequate to finance the counterpart requirement for&#13;
the entire project. Based on the policy letter contained in AGSAC, the AFE's budget will in the&#13;
future be allocated from within the Government's budget, and all revenues from forest products&#13;
or services rendered by AFE will be deposited in the Government's general account.&#13;
2.32 In general, counterpart funding for the project should not represent an additional burden&#13;
to GOH's finances. The same is true of the proposed IDB credit for Agricultural Technology,&#13;
which has a counterpart requirement of about US$12 million. As this would be targeted to&#13;
farmers with high commercial potential, there should be a short-term revenue gain, as a result of&#13;
the IDB financed project, from taxes on the increased marketing of cash crops. Given the&#13;
expected phasing of the two projects, GOH's finances should not be overburdened by the&#13;
combined impact of their counterpart requirements.&#13;
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENT AND&#13;
REPORTING&#13;
A. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.1   Project Coordinating Unit. A project coordination unit (PCU) would be established in&#13;
the SAG to manage the project, facilitate coordination among the various implementing and&#13;
policy-making agencies, assume responsibility for significant procurement and audits, and prepare&#13;
global supervision and evaluation reports. To ensure consistency of project implementation with&#13;
sectoral policies, this unit would be housed within UPEG. To complete the tasks assigned to it,&#13;
the PCU would require four full-time technical consultants, two full time administrative personnel&#13;
and 20 months of local consultants to assist in project implementation as needed. It would be&#13;
provided with one vehicle, computers, office equipment and operating costs. Establishment of the&#13;
PCU has already been initiated in SAG with the appointment of several staff dedicated to the&#13;
start-up of the project. The PCU will be formally established and fully staffed as a condition of&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
3.2   The SAG, through the PCU, would be responsible for the overall management of the&#13;
proposed project. GOH has agreed to maintain adequate staff and/or engage consultants with&#13;
qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA to carry out the project. The administrative and&#13;
technical responsibilities of the PCU are discussed in greater detail in the Project Operations&#13;
Manual (Manual de Operaciones para la Ejecuci6n del Proyecto de Administracion de Areas&#13;
Rurales de Honduras) which can be found in the project files (see Annex J). The content of a&#13;
Participation Agreement among SAG and the various implementing agencies involved in the Land&#13;
Administration Modernization Component was agreed at negotiations. Signing of the&#13;
Participation Agreement is a condition of effectiveness. In general, the PCU would:&#13;
(a)   prepare, in the implementation of the proposed project, the annual operating plan&#13;
and budget, in consultation with all participating agencies and organizations;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
(b)   monitor project budgetary flows over and above those which the implementing&#13;
agencies in the SAG would receive through direct SHCP budgetary procedures;&#13;
(c)   track and report to the appropriate agencies of the GOH and IDA, all expenses&#13;
incurred during project implementation;&#13;
(d)   track the progress in project implementation using the agreed upon performance&#13;
and impact indicators;&#13;
(e)   supervise disbursement, procurement of goods and services, and audits;&#13;
(f)   act as a procurement agent for larger packages of goods and services financed&#13;
under the project to reduce the administrative burden on implementing agencies;&#13;
(g)   manage the land administration modernization component, in coordination with the&#13;
ad hoc Advisory Council for Land Modernization under the CSJ;&#13;
(h)   review the terms of reference of selected contracts and technical specifications of&#13;
selected equipment to ensure consistency with project objectives and established&#13;
implementation targets;&#13;
(i)   provide intellectual leadership on innovative aspects of project implementation,&#13;
such as strategies for beneficiary participation in forest and protected areas&#13;
management plans, and the treatment of indigenous groups in the land adjudication&#13;
process; and&#13;
(j)   initiate periodic supervision missions with or without IDA participation, including&#13;
preparing necessary documentation.&#13;
3.3   Land Administration Modernization. The PCU and an ad hoc Advisory Council&#13;
established by CODA at the federal level would coordinate the land administration modernization&#13;
component. The component would involve the following entities: (a) an Executing Unit,&#13;
consisting of staff from DEC and INA, and reporting to the PCU, which would be responsible for&#13;
carrying out cadastre and adjudication work at the field level; (b) a Territorial Commission,&#13;
comprising representatives of INA, AFE-COHDEFOR, DEC, UPEG, the municipalities and the&#13;
Executing Unit, which would be responsible for coordinating participating institutions and&#13;
arbitrating conflicts that arise in the municipalities; (c) DEC, which would be responsible for&#13;
managing cadastre information, technical quality control of private companies, and establishing&#13;
technical norms for cadastre and adjudication; (d) INA, which would administer the titling&#13;
program at the field level and be responsible for promotional activities at the community level;&#13;
(e) the CSJ Advisory Team, which would assure that cadastre and adjudication are carried out&#13;
according to the laws of the country; (f) the Property Registry (PR), which would reform the&#13;
registration process and establish information and computer systems; and (g) UPEG, which would&#13;
oversee implementation of the component (see organizational chart below). A Municipal&#13;
agreement would be signed by each municipality prior to initiating activities in that municipality.&#13;
3.4   Natural Forest Management. AFE-COHDEFOR would be responsible for carrying out&#13;
the Forest Management sub-component as follows: (a) the regional offices of AFE-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
COHDEFOR-with the participation of local communities-would carry our forest inventories&#13;
and forest management planning as well as prepare related terms of reference, technical&#13;
specifications etc.; and (b) the central offices of AFE-COHDEFOR (Planning, Norms and Control&#13;
and Promotion and Extension Departments) would carry out activities related to institutional&#13;
strengthening, information systems, and forestry regulations. For the biodiversity sub-component,&#13;
the Protected Areas Agency would be responsible for preparing a human resources development&#13;
plan, recruiting and training staff, coordinating actions related to biodiversity with donors and&#13;
financial institutions and the content of a contracting physical improvements in park areas (see&#13;
organizational chart below). The contents of a subsidiary agreement between SAG and AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR was agreed upon at negotiations and the signing of this agreement is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
3.5   The Upland Fund. The SAG, through DICTA and the PCU, would be responsible for&#13;
implementing the Upland Fund. The following entities would also be involved in its&#13;
implementation: (a) an Upland Fund Committee (UFC) (a joint private/public sector committee&#13;
with eight to nine representatives from AFE-COHDEFOR, DICTA, SNITTA, the Finance&#13;
Ministry, professional colleges, farmer and forestry groups would approve fund activities&#13;
according to CONACTA policies; (b) a private sector organization or firm would be contracted as&#13;
Fund Manager to promote the fund, carry out the technical review of proposed fund activities,&#13;
supervise disbursements of fund resources, and maintain quality control; (c) private sector TA&#13;
providers would be contracted to provide extension and training to upland farmers; and&#13;
(d) accounts would be maintained in a private bank which would disburse resources to TA&#13;
providers according to the directions of the Fund Manager. Before submission to the UFC for&#13;
approval, all proposals would be passed to the PCU for verification that they were consistent with&#13;
the IDA Credit Agreement. The creation of the Selection Committee and the establishment of the&#13;
fund are both conditions for disbursement against this subcomponent.&#13;
3.6  IDB would, within the same time frame as this project, finance a technology transfer and&#13;
generation project targeted at large, medium and small producers with commercial potential (i.e.,&#13;
in terreno de vocaci6n agricola). IDA has agreed with IDB that the same management structure&#13;
would be used for the two funds in order to support the establishment of a GOH mechanism for&#13;
channeling of technology funds nationally. The regulations and criteria for the fund were agreed&#13;
at negotiations and comments were made on a draft decree for establishing the Technology Fund.&#13;
The effectiveness of the fund would be evaluated during the first pilot review and the formal&#13;
review and action plans for future operation of the fund would be agreed during each of those&#13;
reviews.&#13;
3.7   A longer-term mechanism has been proposed by SAG/DICTA for channeling and&#13;
administering funds through the creation of a separate foundation or trust. The IDB-funded&#13;
project would have as a goal over its five year life the creation of this entity. As this would&#13;
require a legislative act (which may require several years to obtain) the project would begin&#13;
implementation through an interim mechanism. If pilot and mid-terms reviews recommend that a&#13;
legally constituted foundation or trust is set up in later years, the Upland Fund mechanism could&#13;
be modified to reflect the needs of a more permanent institution.&#13;
3.8   Flow of Funds. Chart 1 below lists the agencies charged with approval of expenditures&#13;
related to the different components of the project. The two agencies with final expenditure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
approval are the PCU, acting for the SAG, and AFE-COHDEFOR. In the Land Administration&#13;
Modernization Component, the PCU would approve withdrawals from the Special Account to&#13;
cover eligible expenditures, agreed in annual operational plans drawn up by the implementing&#13;
agents (INA, DEC, PR and the Territorial Commissions at field level). INA and DEC would also&#13;
make expenditures under the project using counterpart funds provided through normal budgetary&#13;
processes. In the Forest Management and Institutional Strengthening Sub-Components,&#13;
excepting Protected Areas Strengthening, AFE-COHDEFOR would make withdrawals from the&#13;
Special Account against agreed Annual Operating Plans for eligible expenditures, which would be&#13;
supplemented by counterpart resources derived from its own operating budget. It may also&#13;
advance its own field offices up to three months of eligible expenditures for agreed project&#13;
activities. In the case of the Biodiversity Conservation sub-component, the PCU would approve&#13;
expenditures from the Special Account to be made by the Protected Areas Agency within the new&#13;
Environment and Natural Resources Secretariat. In the case of the Upland Fund, a current&#13;
(Upland Fund) account would be established in a commercial bank, which would make payments&#13;
to service providers against established contractual arrangements. This Upland Fund Account&#13;
would be replenished regularly from the Special Account in accordance with agreed operational&#13;
plans and on authority of the PCU. These replenishments would be contingent on presentation of&#13;
eligible SOEs.&#13;
B. TECHNICAL AND FiNANCALL AuDrrs&#13;
3.9   The PCU would maintain records and accounts of all transactions related to the Project.&#13;
The Government would hire independent auditing services satisfactory to IDA to prepare annual&#13;
audits at the end of each Honduran fiscal year, starting January 1997. The audit reports would&#13;
include separate opinions on the use of SOEs and the special account. The PCU and AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR would submit the audit reports to IDA within six months of the close of each fiscal&#13;
year. International consultants would conduct technical audits of the land administration&#13;
modernization and natural resources component at the end of year 2 and year 4. These would be&#13;
critical given the newness of thefolio real approach in Honduras and the lack of experience in&#13;
AFE-COHDEFOR with decentralized procedures. Procurement arrangements were agreed with&#13;
GOH during negotiations.&#13;

3.10 AFE-COHDEFOR and SAG would maintain separate central project accounts, including&#13;
consolidation of accounts from different directorates. Each of AFE-COHDEFOR's four regional&#13;
offices would also maintain separate accounts for project expenditures incurred by them. All&#13;
accounts would adequately reflect project expenditures made in accordance with sound&#13;
accounting practices. The PCU would review financial documents (procurement, disbursements&#13;
requests, budget audit reports) before submission to IDA. A certified copy of the project audit by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to IDA and in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial&#13;
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March, 1982), would be&#13;
submitted to IDA not more than six months after the completion of each financial year. The audit&#13;
report would include a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against certified&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) and the Special Account. The PCU would contract the&#13;
auditors as a multi-year contract to increase likelihood of compliance with this activity. The PCU&#13;
would make SOEs available to IDA and its supervision missions. Accounting and auditing&#13;
arrangements were agreed at negotiations.&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.11  All project components financed under the proposed IDA credit would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under EBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January&#13;
1995, and revised in January and August 1996). Procurement arrangements are summarized in&#13;
Table 2. The SAG or AFE-COHDEFOR would be responsible for all the procurement of items to&#13;
be financed by IDA.&#13;
3.12  Given the fact that this is the first IDA project to be implemented by the SAG, training on&#13;
IDA' s procurement procedures started during preparation with the management of a PPF and&#13;
assistance from UNDP. Procurement skills of the SAG would be further enhanced by having staff&#13;
undergo IDA sponsored procurement and disbursement training courses.&#13;
3.13  Works. To the extent practicable, contracts for works would be grouped into bid&#13;
packages estimated to cost the equivalent of US$150,000 or more. Such contracts would be&#13;
awarded through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) using standard bidding documents&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Small works valued at less than US$150,000 would be procured under lump-&#13;
sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from at least three qualified&#13;
domestic contractors, up to an aggregate amount of US$325,000.&#13;
3.14 Goods. Vehicles, computers and office equipment purchases would be packaged into&#13;
contracts valued at more than US$150,000 and procured through Limited International Bidding&#13;
(LIB) from suppliers with established service and maintenance facilities in Honduras and&#13;
neighboring countries. Goods (including vehicles, computers and office equipment, field&#13;
equipment and furniture) would be procured through NCB in packages valued at more than&#13;
US$25,000 but less than US$150,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$800,000. Miscellaneous&#13;
equipment items valued at US$25,000 or less, up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000 would&#13;
be procured using national and international shopping procedures, based on price quotations from&#13;
at least three suppliers.&#13;

3.15   Consultant Services and Technical Assistance. All consultant services would be&#13;
procured according to the guidelines, Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency (August, 1981). These services, which are estimated to&#13;
aggregate to US$16.6 million, would be contracted using IDA-issued standard form of contracts.&#13;
Technical assistance for the Fund for Upland Producers would be procured by clients under&#13;
contracts with values between US$5,000 and US$15,000 on the basis of procurement and&#13;
procedures as specified in Annex D.&#13;
3.16   All procurement aspects were confirmed during negotiations, in particular on the use of:&#13;
(a) standard bidding documents for NCB procedures for the procurement of goods and civil&#13;
works satisfactory to IDA; and (b) standard contract forms for consulting services issued by IDA&#13;
for lump-sum contracts and complex, time-based consulting assignments. For prior review limits,&#13;
see Table 3.&#13;
3.17 Provisions in Legal Documents. An assessment by the Bank of Honduras procurement&#13;
procedures and regulations indicated that they are not fully compatible with Bank Group&#13;
procurement guidelines and policy. To resolve inconsistencies between local legislation and&#13;
Bank's procurement guidelines during negotiations, agreement was sought to include the&#13;
following procurement provisions in the legal documents. (a) For goods and works to be&#13;
procured under LCB, LIB and NCB procedures: (i) contracts would be awarded to the lowest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

condition of participation in the selection process; b. give any participation to local consultants;&#13;
and c. furnish any certificate issued by a local authority about their legal capacity or tax status.&#13;
(b) For consultants' services, foreign consultants would not be required to: (i) be locally&#13;
registered as a condition of participation in the selection process; (ii) give any participation to&#13;
local consultants; and (iii) furnish any certificate issued by a local authority about their legal&#13;
capacity or tax status&#13;

3.18 Procurement Review. Prior review by IDA would be required for: (a) all contracts&#13;
awarded through LIB and ICB; (b) the first two contracts for goods, and works awarded under&#13;
NCB; and (c) all contracts for consulting services, with the exceptions noted below in Table 3. All&#13;
other contracts would be subject to ex-post review by IDA during supervision. These&#13;
arrangements would ensure prior review by IDA of about 60 percent of the value of all IDA-&#13;
financed contracts. The PCU would maintain all procurement documentation for periodic&#13;
supervision by IDA staff. The table below highlights the thresholds for each procurement method&#13;
and for prior review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
3.19 In addition to the IDA's ex-post review, post-review would also be carried out by the&#13;
SAG. For this purpose, the SAG would recruit auditors, under terms of reference satisfactory to&#13;
IDA, who would not only examine financial implementation, but also procurement procedures,&#13;
physical implementation and impact on beneficiaries. These auditors would carry out annual&#13;
audits on the basis of a sample not lower than 60 percent of the IDA financed investments&#13;
categories in the first project year, 50 percent in the second project year and 40 percent in later&#13;
years. For convenience and to avoid overlaps, the same auditors would carry out an ex-post&#13;
review of the expenditures and investments financed by IDA.&#13;
3.20 Procurement Agent. The PCU may elect to retain the services of UNDP as procurement&#13;
agent to assist in the procurement of goods and services.&#13;
D. DISBuRRSEMENT&#13;
3.21  Disbursements would occur over the project's five-year life. The Credit closing date&#13;
would be January 31, 2003.&#13;
3.22  The Credit would be disbursed against eligible project expenditures at the rate of 85&#13;
percent for works under the land administration modernization component, 70 percent for works&#13;
under the forest management subcomponent, 70 percent for works under the forest management&#13;
plans, and 85 percent for other works; 100 percent for foreign costs for equipment and furniture&#13;
and 80 percent for goods purchased locally; 100 percent for consultant services and training; 100&#13;
percent for upland fund sub-projects, and 90 percent, 50 percent and 20 percent, on a declining&#13;
basis, for incremental recurrent costs. The projected eight-year schedule of IDA disbursements&#13;
(see Annex F) reflects the historical Honduras disbursement profile (for all sectors), which spans&#13;
eight years; the profile is adjusted to reflect the best estimate of expected IDA disbursements.&#13;
3.23  Special Account.  The Borrower, GOH, would establish a Special Account for the&#13;
project in the Central Bank, under conditions satisfactory to IDA, in US currency, with an&#13;
authorized allocation of US US$2.0 million and an initial deposit of US$ 0.5 million, equal to&#13;
about four months of estimated disbursements. SHCP would manage the Special Account under&#13;
established procedures between IDA and the GOH. The SAG would access the Special Account&#13;
through SHCP, and would request the account to be replenished monthly (no less frequently than&#13;
every 3 months) or whenever one third of the authorized amount has been withdrawn, whichever&#13;
occurs first. Withdrawal applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be fully&#13;
documented, except for expenditures not subject to prior review by IDA. All replenishment&#13;
applications should be accompanied by monthly bank statements of the Special Account, which&#13;
have been reconciled by the Borrower. Withdrawal applications for payments to be made outside&#13;
the Special Account would be accepted provided that the amount requested is equivalent to at&#13;
least 10 percent of the amount advanced to the Special Account (US$50,000).&#13;
3.24 Documentation of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made on the basis of full&#13;
documentation for all expenditures made under contracts requiring prior review by IDA and&#13;
amendments to contracts for consultant services raising the value of such contracts above the&#13;
prior review limits. Disbursements against contracts for goods, civil and mapping works under&#13;
US$150,000, consultants firms under US$50,000 and individuals under US$20,000; subprojects,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
training and incremental recurrent expenditures would be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs), with the exception of the first two contracts for goods and works.&#13;
E. PROJECT REPORTING, MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
3.25  The SAG would be responsible for the overall project, and the PCU attached to the SAG&#13;
would manage the project on a daily basis. Reporting, monitoring and evaluation on each&#13;
individual component would be the responsibility of SAG and the AFE-COHDEFOR. In&#13;
addition, all project agencies (PR, AFE-COHDEFOR, DICTA, DEC and INA) would submit a&#13;
quarterly progress report to the PCU, which would collate reports and prepare an overall progress&#13;
report for IDA within one month of the end of the quarter. The PCU would establish a&#13;
management information system (MIS) to facilitate monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). M&amp;E&#13;
would be in the form of quarterly reports prepared by the PCU for the SAG and IDA. M&amp;E&#13;
indicators are part of the MIS system. The PCU would complete the MIS design, which would&#13;
include periodic reports on impact, and quarterly reports on financial, implementation, and legal&#13;
indicators of project progress (based on indicators in Annex G). Financial indicators would&#13;
monitor the financial health of the SAG as well as the counterpart funds availability for the project&#13;
as per yearly budgeting process. Implementation indicators would monitor the project's progress&#13;
and would include institutional strengthening, biodiversity, Upland Fund, a modern registry&#13;
system and institutional and human resources capacity established to maintain the system.&#13;
Monitoring formats were agreed at negotiations and detailed performance monitoring indicators&#13;
have been included in the Project Implementation Letter. In addition, each quarterly report for the&#13;
second quarter of each year should include an investment plan for the succeeding calendar year&#13;
and summary of actions planned to improve implementation. For the last quarter report for the&#13;
third year of the project, an evaluation of progress since project inception should be included.&#13;
F. SUPERVISION BY IDA&#13;
3.26  The project requires close supervision during the first phase because of the number of pilot&#13;
initiatives in the project. Major tools for supervision would be: (a) quarterly reports with M&amp;E&#13;
information generated by the MIS (Annex GI, including impact, financial, implementation, and&#13;
legal indicators; (b) periodic independent studies; (c) an evaluation of the pilot phase of the&#13;
project, expected to be in year 2 of the project; and (d) a mid-term review, expected to be in year&#13;
3 of the project. Timing and scope of the mid-term review and pilot phase review were agreed at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
3.27  Periodic Independent Studies. During negotiations, IDA would receive assurances that&#13;
the Government would carry out periodic independent studies to review aspects of&#13;
implementation. Studies would involve: (a) gender concerns; (b) indigenous issues;&#13;
(c) representativeness of upland fund proposals; (d) impacts of management plans; (e) efficiency&#13;
and equity of land adjudication process; (f) evaluation of maintenance system offolio real; and&#13;
(g) forest policy and regulatory issues.&#13;
3.28 Mid-Term Review and Pilot Evaluation. During negotiations, IDA received assurances&#13;
that the government would complete a review no later than January 31, 2000 and an evaluation of&#13;
the pilot components no later than 14 months after credit effectiveness, as a pre-condition to&#13;
expansion to non-pilot areas. In addition to the points normally covered in annual reviews, these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
reviews would analyze the need to restructure or redesign any aspect of the project. The mid-&#13;
term review would also review the following year's work plan, and if necessary, make appropriate&#13;
changes to achieve project objectives more efficiently.&#13;
4. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
4.1   The project would have a number of important economic, environmental and social&#13;
benefits. First, the land component would enhance land security which, in turn, would contribute&#13;
to increased agricultural investment and productivity, greater environmental management and&#13;
improved land value. The component would also improve the cartographic base and judicial&#13;
system which would permit the Government to properly manage important watershed, forested&#13;
and wildlife areas that have environmental values for the nation and the international community.&#13;
Second, through the Forest Management subcomponent and Upland Fund, the project would&#13;
improve nutrition, food security and the income base of the rural poor by improving crop&#13;
production, supporting vegetable production, and promoting new income streams through&#13;
forestry. Third, the Natural Resources Management component would lead to improved forest&#13;
conservation and management by strengthening the institutional capacity of AFE-COHDEFOR.&#13;
This contrasts with donor-funded projects in Honduras that have typically established small&#13;
independent executing bodies and avoided the difficult task of reforming bureaucratic structures.&#13;
The component would also benefit local communities and residents in forest areas by giving them&#13;
greater control over forest management and protection. Fourth, the Biodiversity Conservation&#13;
would support self-financing systems for protected areas which would allow these areas to attain&#13;
greater financial independence and long-term sustainability.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
4.2   The economic analysis of the proposed project has focused only on the productive&#13;
activities included in the Natural Resources Management Component, representing about 50&#13;
percent of total project costs, for which reasonable benefit calculations can be made. The other&#13;
components (land administration modernization, forest management, institution building etc.) are&#13;
not as easily susceptible to cost-benefit analysis. Clearly, however, they are important pre-&#13;
conditions to ensuring longer-term investment and avoiding undesirable future social, economic&#13;
and environmental costs.&#13;
4.3   Land Administration Modernization. Project design operated under a minimum cost&#13;
and focused on comparing the financial costs of implementation alternatives. An analysis of the&#13;
potential for financial sustainability of the modernized registry system to be put in place by the&#13;
project was carried out (see project file: Korczowski, 1996. Sistema del Folio Real Nacionaly&#13;
SostenibilidadFinanciera). This demonstrated the conditions (institutional and cost structure)&#13;
under which the registry could be financially sustainable, and that the project design aimed at&#13;
ensuring those conditions were met. The resulting cost of approximately US$2.85 per ha for&#13;
institutional development and for completing the legal land information base for 37 percent of&#13;
Honduras' land area (including over 50 percent of the country's production forests) is extremely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
low. This is possible because Honduras has significant experience and is relatively better&#13;
endowed with existing information and infrastructure than its neighbors.&#13;
4.4   Enhancing the legal security of landholders would resolve long-standing tenure conflicts&#13;
which have discouraged investment and good management. It would create a more transparent&#13;
and efficient land market, and it would provide a mechanism to preserve the value of future&#13;
investments in the cadastral and land adjudication processes. It may also in the long run provide&#13;
potential lenders with the security necessary to provide credit to landholders engaged in market&#13;
agriculture or forestry. A recent University of Maryland study involving a small sample of land&#13;
reform beneficiaries with and without legal title estimated that as a group the former enjoy on&#13;
average a 5 percent increase in income (IRR 17 percent) as a function of holding legal title.&#13;
4.5   Forest Management. Honduras' forests are one of its most valuable economic assets.&#13;
The forest management activities proposed in the project would lead to improved management of&#13;
this resource (national, ejido and private forests) and, in particular, of the pine forests. The&#13;
current status of these forests varies greatly, but in almost all cases, it can be improved through&#13;
the application of simple forest management techniques. These forests, without management, are&#13;
estimated to produce between 2 and 4 m3 of commercial wood per hectare per year. With a&#13;
minimum of management and silvicultural treatments, this could be doubled to between 4 and 8&#13;
r3/ha/yr. A recent discussion paper (PRODEPAH, 1996) implies the potential for a ten- to&#13;
eighteen-fold increase over 1994 state revenues from stumpage charges in the national forests&#13;
dedicated to timber production. In addition, annual export earnings from well-managed industrial&#13;
forests have the long-term potential to reach US$200 to US$400 million. Total forest export&#13;
earmings from 1990 to 1994 were US$103 million.&#13;
4.6   For the purpose of estimating economic benefits to the forest management activities,&#13;
several representative forestry and farm models were developed in the economic analysis: one-&#13;
hectare models and a 20-year project model. These are presented in detail in Annex HI. The&#13;
one-hectare models were found to be both financially and economically viable -- in all cases&#13;
because there exists standing timber which can be profitably exploited with relatively low per unit&#13;
investments -- the absolute retums to improved management are quite marginal and sensitive to&#13;
management costs. Project work would expand and strengthen the current forestry information&#13;
and impact monitoring system to ensure that future decision-making is based on sounder&#13;
economic criteria than at present.&#13;
4.7   In the case of the 20-year project model, the presence of immediately exploitable forests&#13;
ensures that even marginally efficient operations can be both financially and economically&#13;
attractive. A sensitivity analysis showed that results were very robust. Costs increases and&#13;
stumpage value decreases in the order of 50 percent were required to undermine the viability of&#13;
all of the scenarios. For the purpose of comparing incremental project costs and benefits, the&#13;
"medium" scenario was chosen as the most likely outcome for the without-project comparator.&#13;
The medium scenario assumes that the major focus would be on timber extraction from existing&#13;
well-stocked forests with the minimum investment in overall forest management. Based on this&#13;
comparison, the present value (using a 10 percent discount rate) of the sub-component's&#13;
incremental benefits is US$17.6 million, based on an incremental timber production of 3.2 million&#13;
cubic meters. The IRR is greater than 50 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
4.8   The Upland Fund. This sub-component would provide technical assistance and training&#13;
to 6,500 poor rural households for natural forest management, hill-slope agriculture and livestock.&#13;
Actual activities under the project would vary considerably depending on community demands,&#13;
the location and quality of the producers' land and the technical skills and initiative of the&#13;
producers. A set of representative household models of the types of activities proposed, with&#13;
estimated costs and returns over time, were prepared to determine financial and economic&#13;
viability. The focus of the agricultural models were basic grains (corn, beans, and rice), but&#13;
supplemental financial models for livestock (meat and milk) were also developed. A review of a&#13;
series of case studies from Honduras provided the basis for estimations.&#13;
4.9   A global analysis of the impact of the upland fund was also carried out, based on basic&#13;
grain crops and forestry. The main expected interventions from the fund would be:&#13;
(a)    agriculture - increased planting density (corn crops), halting burning of fields,&#13;
contour cultivation, crop residue management, "green mulch" and contour&#13;
vegetative barriers of vetiver;&#13;
(b)   forestry - silvicultural treatments (thinning, assisted natural regeneration), pine&#13;
forest management/harvesting, and forest protection (fire, encroachment).&#13;
4.10  Calculated benefits do not include potential off-site impacts of reduced soil erosion and&#13;
un-off. The primary incentives for adoption would be on-site benefits (i.e., increased and more&#13;
stable yields, lower inputs, etc.). For forestry, the same forest structure, yield impacts and&#13;
incremental production were assumed as in the national forest models. Estimates of deforestation&#13;
were developed based on national level data, and the assumed 60 percent reduction with project is&#13;
based on Honduras PDBL/CIDA project data. A recent project review found reductions in&#13;
deforestation rates of 85 to 90 percent resulting from the provision of forest usufruct instruments&#13;
and extension services to community groups. Based on the crop activity models, three farm&#13;
models were tested. All of the models were financially viable, suggesting that beneficiaries are&#13;
likely to be interested in the adoption of the improved farming measures. The results of this&#13;
economic analysis is presented in detail in Annex HI and summarized below in Table 5.&#13;
4.11  Biodiversity Protection - The protection of Honduras's national parks and reserves is&#13;
essential to: (a) reduce encroachment of agricultural activities and impacts from fire and other&#13;
activities; (b) increase visitation, particularly by eco-tourists, in order to increase foreign exchange&#13;
income; and (c) improve the protection of the nation's ecology and biodiversity. It is not possible,&#13;
with the information currently available in Honduras, to estimate the expected increases in direct&#13;
income to the protected area system through construction and operation of modern visitors'&#13;
centers and improved road access to the areas; nor the potential increases in tourist income from&#13;
persons visiting the country. It is clear, however, from the example of neighboring Costa Rica&#13;
and from the possible spill-over from joint (e.g., Central American) eco-tourism efforts, that these&#13;
benefits could be substantial.&#13;
4.12  Estimates generated during project design suggest that with current practices and the state&#13;
maintaining its traditional role, investments of about US$10 million would be required in&#13;
equipment and infrastructure with recurrent annual costs of about US$5 million to operate the&#13;
system adequately. Project interventions are expected to assist in lowering the State's costs by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
assisting in rationalizing priorities and roles of government (national and local), communities,&#13;
private sector and NGOs in protected area management. Preliminary estimates show the potential&#13;
to reduce state recurrent costs to around US$2.5 to US$3 million per year while generating&#13;
income through tourism of between US$1 million and US$1.9 million per year.&#13;

4.13   Conclusion. As summarized in the table above, 50 percent of project investment funds&#13;
going to directly productive investments would produce measurable economic returns necessary&#13;
to justify almost 75 percent of the total proposed project costs. The project as designed is a&#13;
coherent whole, however, and would result in substantial longer-term benefits in land tenure and&#13;
social well-being that have not been factored into the economic evaluation.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL IMACT&#13;
4.14 The proposed project has been assigned to EnvironmentalAssessment Category B. An&#13;
environmental analysis, was carried out during project preparation and is available as Annex H2&#13;
and in the Public Information Center (PIC). The analysis concluded that the present legal and&#13;
policy framework for the sector of the AML is adequate to foster a balanced natural resources&#13;
strategy for the country and project areas. It identified the following risks: (a) increased or&#13;
induced pressures on common and open forests; (b) potentially negative impacts from natural&#13;
resources management interventions; (c) the potential that biodiversity conservation and buffer&#13;
zone activities could attract population to the areas; and (d) undercapacity of AFE-COHDEFOR&#13;
and the SAG to ensure technical soundness of planning and implementation and/or reduced&#13;
institutional capacity to address pressures outside the project area. All these risks are addressed&#13;
in the design of the project.&#13;
4.15  All four project components are designed to improve the environmental management of&#13;
forests and to rationalize land use according to equity and efficiency criteria. The Land&#13;
Administration Modernization component would register existing rights more systematically and&#13;
reliably and would not change existing ownership or land use. More secure tenure should&#13;
improve incentives for resources management, given that reforms in agricultural and forestry&#13;
policies under the AGSAC have removed disincentives for forestry management on lands of forest&#13;
vocation relative to livestock and agriculture. The Natural Resources Management component&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
would improve management of blocks of public forests and surrounding areas, initiating&#13;
conservation activities in priority watersheds as well. Timber and non-timber (primarily resin)&#13;
harvesting activities in pine forests would be carried out according to government guidelines for&#13;
sustainable forest management, following the system for AFE-COHDEFOR supervision and&#13;
auditing of activities. The Protected Areas sub-component and proposed GEF project would&#13;
include a consultative process to rationalize the SINAPH and encourage appropriate local&#13;
management of areas of biodiversity or environmental value. This would prevent harvesting&#13;
activities from being carried out in areas that should be protected. Sub-projects financed through&#13;
the Upland Fund may include use of pesticides and fertilizers. The activities would be small-scale,&#13;
however, and the technological packages eligible for financing would include soil and water&#13;
management, integrated and biological pest management and other environmentally positive&#13;
technologies. The increased sustainability of rural livelihoods should lead to improved land and&#13;
forest management and reduce incentives for forest conversion. Assurance was given at&#13;
negotiations that there is no involuntary resettlement of people from the Protected Areas&#13;
envisioned, and that in any event, prior to any required resettlement, the Borrower would prepare&#13;
a plan satisfactory to IDA and only implement such plan in accordance with IDA guidelines.&#13;
4.16  All natural resources interventions proposed under the project are proven in Honduras.&#13;
For management of natural forests, the Honduras forestry sector has received valuable support&#13;
from bilateral donors in the development of methodologies. In the period 1988 to 1997 a total of&#13;
US$63.7 million of grant funds were programmed for the Honduran forestry sector (AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR, 12/95), mostly into pine forest management and related activities (planning, etc.).&#13;
Almost all aspects of forestry (policy, institutional, forest management, and research) have&#13;
received and continue to receive attention (in forest management by CIDA, USAID, GTZ, the&#13;
Dutch Government and FINNIDA; in protected areas by CIDA, USAID, GTZ, the Netherlands&#13;
and WWF; in social forestry by CIDA, GTZ, Norway, and UNDP). From the "best practices"&#13;
perspective the project begins with extremely solid foundations. The weak areas relate to existing&#13;
capacity for execution of best practice approaches and to overall environmental planning in forest&#13;
management. Relevant to the latter, the current approaches to such planning are focused on&#13;
individual forest management units without considering them within a landscape and aggregate&#13;
impacts between management plans. These weaknesses are specifically dealt with in project&#13;
design through training, regional forestry sector enviromnental assessments and technical&#13;
assistance inputs&#13;
D. PARTICIPATION AND SOCIAL IMACTS&#13;
Participation Plan&#13;
4.17  A participation plan has been prepared for this project, drawing upon a social assessment&#13;
(Annex H3) which paid significant attention to gender and indigenous peoples development. The&#13;
social assessment included an analysis of policies and past programs in land administration and&#13;
forestry and the impact of these on the poor and vulnerable groups, including women and&#13;
indigenous peoples. The participation plan includes five types of initiatives: (a) definition of a&#13;
process for incorporating local populations in the design and implementation master plans for the&#13;
forestry and protected areas in the project; (b) on-going M&amp;E to shape the process of&#13;
participation in land adjudication to be carried out in the pilot areas; (c) training and orientation of&#13;
project staff and beneficiaries on indigenous and gender aspects; (d) an IDF for indigenous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
capacity building; and (e) design of the Upland Fund to provide access to poor producers and&#13;
NGOs through a selection process with transparent criteria and procedures.&#13;
Population in the Upland Areas of Honduras and the Project Area&#13;
4.18  There are, according to the 1993 agricultural census, 237,863 farm families with less than&#13;
10 hectares covering 587,576 hectares of land and 227,642 farms of less than 5 hectares with&#13;
384,078 hectares in Honduras. Most of the farmers with less than 5 hectares are found in the&#13;
marginal uplands. Families with less than 10 hectares farm 17.6% of all agricultural holdings in&#13;
the country, and comprise 54.3% of the population. These small holders produce mainly white&#13;
maize, beans, a creole variety sorghum (maicillo), and rice. Maize is produced by 75 % of small-&#13;
scale farmers and beans by a third. Sorghum is produced by 52% of farmers in the south and is&#13;
used primarily as cattle feed. There is little reliable data on the extent of cattle pasture, but it is&#13;
extensive-- 1993 census figures are 1.5 million hectares under pasture while extrapolations from&#13;
1991 regional data estimate 2.6 million hectares under pasture. In comparison to other Central&#13;
American countries, the cattle expansion phase began later and continued after political conflicts&#13;
had checked expansion in neighboring countries.&#13;
4.19  Many of the upland farmers cultivate land classified as part of the public forest estate. As&#13;
described in Annex B, Land Administration Modernization Component, farmers cultivating lands&#13;
classified as public are eligible for title should the land be judged of agricultural vocation. All&#13;
other lands are classified as forest vocation and can be cultivated through usufruct, but not titled.&#13;
The main forested areas of the north and west are the agricultural frontier. Many of the upland&#13;
farmers in this area migrated from poorer regions in the south and east or moved into the hilly&#13;
areas after selling their plots to cattle ranchers. Since 1982, Honduras has had an active land&#13;
titling program to give title to smallholders settled on agricultural lands within the public estate.&#13;
Through this program, 77,000 titles have been given for about 660,000 hectares. In addition,&#13;
some cooperatives were given titles, but by 1993 only 993 of these remained with 144,697&#13;
hectares, mostly in the valleys. Most of the former cooperative members are seeking individual&#13;
titles from INA. The number of farm families still without title is estimated to be around 200,000&#13;
of which about one half would not qualify for title since their holding is less than 1 hectare or&#13;
classified as urban areas. The first phase of the land administration pilot in 15 municipalities alone&#13;
is predicted to identify 6,000 farms eligible for title.&#13;
4.20  The small-farmer population in the 14 public forest management field unit boundaries of&#13;
the three Departments included in the project area--Yoro, Olancho and San Francisco Moraz6n--&#13;
is 14,775 families. These are the majority of families in the project area. While land holding&#13;
figures are not available for the upland areas of these Departments, more than 95% of the families&#13;
in the rapid rural appraisal communities were small-holders with less than 2.5 has. and the&#13;
majority had some land holdings in addition to their homesteads, however marginal. Most did not&#13;
have title to their agricultural holdings. Apart from limited mid and larger sized farmers in the&#13;
valleys and some uplands of the project Departments, therefore, the large majority of the upland&#13;
farmers are small, subsistence farmers with marginal holdings, both in size and quality. The&#13;
upland fund would provide support to landed farmers in agriculture and agro-forestry and to&#13;
landless residents in municipal or social forestry initiatives on ejido and public lands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Indigenous Peoples&#13;
4.21  Three types of indigenous groups are found in the pilot and protected areas--the Pech,&#13;
Xicaque, y Garifunas. The social assessment indicated that there are important traditional forms&#13;
of government that should be taken into account in undertaking interventions under these&#13;
components. The project would include promotional activities targeted to indigenous peoples in&#13;
the project area and special studies to evaluate their special interests and needs prior to&#13;
implementation of management plans. Also, recognizing the nascent development of indigenous&#13;
political organizations and lack of a clear policy on indigenous peoples and resources management&#13;
in public forests, project preparation has included the identification of an IDF grant for indigenous&#13;
training and capacity building. The land administration modernization component would initially&#13;
be carried out in departments with no indigenous populations. The pilot activities would include&#13;
an evaluation of norms and procedures, and prior to expansion of the pilot to other areas, a&#13;
special study to evaluate constraints to registration of indigenous land rights under the folio real.&#13;
At present indigenous communities have the option of requesting individual or collective land&#13;
tenure. One issue identified by indigenous groups is the need to obtain legal status for informal,&#13;
first-tier indigenous organizations, for their formal participation in social forestry contracts with&#13;
AFE-COHDEFOR and communal land titling.&#13;
Gender Issues&#13;
4.22  The social assessment identified a number of constraints for women's active participation&#13;
in project activities. Forestry and agriculture programs have not reached women farmers and&#13;
forest-users, and family income-earning opportunities have no necessarily improved the standard&#13;
of living of women in these families. Constraints include the lack of appropriate channeling of&#13;
information to women, the lack of avenues for consultation of women on forest management&#13;
issues, the lack of appropriate technical packages, and the lack of gender training for the majority&#13;
of extension staff in government and non-government agencies. Nonetheless there are trained&#13;
personnel in country and some positive models in on-going upland projects that can be used in the&#13;
project. While there is no legal constraint on the titling of women landholders, couples without&#13;
legal marriage papers (the majority of rural households) are not eligible to apply for joint title.&#13;
This issue would be studied by the land agencies and a solution recommended for implementation&#13;
in the project.&#13;
E. RISKS&#13;
4.23  The major risks of the project relate to: (a) its complexity; (b) Government commitment;&#13;
and (c) institutional capacity.&#13;
4.24 Complexity. The issues involved in reversing the destruction of Honduras' natural&#13;
resources are inherently complex. There are no simple solutions. Furthermore, poverty, forest&#13;
destruction, soil erosion and lack of tenure are closely interrelated and should be seen as part of&#13;
the same problem. Recognizing that, the proposed project attempts to set in motion processes&#13;
which will make an impact on all of these elements, but in each case, a very cautious approach&#13;
must be taken. The Land Administration Modernization component would attempt to tackle the&#13;
most fundamental problem, a lack of modem registry, before any further attempt was made to title&#13;
land. It proposes a small pilot in one municipality, expanding to fifteen and then to several&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
departments, and at each stage the process would be subjected to close review, open debate and&#13;
possible redesign. Disbursements under the project would be subject at each stage to full&#13;
implementation of agreed actions. The same pilot approach has been applied to the Forest&#13;
Management and Biodiversity components. In the former, progress would only be made through&#13;
careful participatory approaches involving local planning, and priorities areas for intervention by&#13;
the project have been set in accordance with already established COHDEFOR criteria. In the&#13;
latter, a gradual approach to modifying the existing SINAPH has been chosen, intensive training&#13;
has been included, and a minimum investment proposed for a first phase development of a&#13;
financially sustainable park system. The Upland Fund would also take a very cautious approach.&#13;
A relatively small amount of money would be committed to it; its regulations and management&#13;
would be subject to regular review and potential redesign in the light of experience; and close&#13;
consultation would be retained with IDB, in order to maintain consistency with the fund being&#13;
financed under the Agricultural Technology Project.&#13;
4.25  Government Commitment. There is no guarantee that a suitable fiscal environment will&#13;
remain in place throughout the implementation period of the proposed project. Nevertheless,&#13;
there are significant factors leading to confidence in the Government's commitment to the&#13;
objectives of the project itself. Not least among these is the passage or advanced state of&#13;
preparation of six key laws on which the principles of the proposed project are based. These are:&#13;
the Municipal Law (1991); the AML (1992); the Property Registry Law (1987); the Environment&#13;
Law (1993); the Forest Incentives Law (1993); and the General Law of Public Administration&#13;
(still in draft);. Confidence in government commitment is also derived from the project&#13;
preparation process itself, which was long and arduous. During that time, there were major shifts&#13;
in government thinking, especially with regard to the decentralization of COHDEFOR, and the&#13;
integration of the Supreme Court, PR, DEC and INA to make a common effort to modernize the&#13;
registry system. These principles are now firmly embedded in the design of the project, and in&#13;
undertaking the project the Government would be demonstrating its acceptance of a radically&#13;
altered institutional environment than has existed hitherto. At the same time, each major&#13;
component of the project carries with it a real prospect of financial sustainability. The built-in&#13;
review processes also provide several major check points for modification or even suspension in&#13;
the event of weakening commitment.&#13;
4.26  Institutional Capacity. The weakness of existing institutions is one of the prime factors&#13;
underlying the design of the proposed project, in which a significant proportion of the resources&#13;
would be devoted to institutional strengthening at national and local level, to introducing concepts&#13;
of participatory planning and decision-making, to training, and to modernization of technical&#13;
processes. Key factors leading to confidence in the institutional arrangements are: (a) reliance on&#13;
existing institutions, combined with introduction of new processes, as for example in the&#13;
decentralization of COHDEFOR and the strengthening of its field offices; (b) increased reliance&#13;
on NGO's and the private sector, as would be the case in the management, promotion and&#13;
execution of the Upland Fund; (c) creation of a simple PCU with authority derived directly from&#13;
the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock and located inside the existing structure of the SAG&#13;
(UPEG); (d) mechanisms which specifically aim to unite disparate agencies currently involved in&#13;
land administration; and (e) limitation of overall management and spending authority to two&#13;
institutions, the PCU and COHDEFOR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
F. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.27  The project is intended to consolidate and sustain the institutional reforms that were&#13;
initiated under the AGSAC and the AML. The activities identified are a part of the core work&#13;
program of the SAG, the PR, and DEC. The land administration modernization strategy has the&#13;
support of an inter-agency commission headed by the Supreme Court of Justice. The project&#13;
would seek to create government capacity to implement the type of participatory, site-specific&#13;
natural resources management interventions that until now have only successfully been carried out&#13;
by recruited staff of donor-financed pilot projects. Based on a review of current experience in&#13;
the country with decentralized mechanisms for channeling development resources, including the&#13;
Honduras Social Investment Fund (FHIS, Cr. 2766), the project would also devolve substantial&#13;
planning and implementation responsibility to municipal, non-government and farmer-based&#13;
organizations, and foster joint management of public forested and protected areas. Promoting&#13;
local responsibility in this way should help sustain project activities. The project coordination unit&#13;
in the SAG would receive complementary financing for additional staff under the 1DB-financed&#13;
project for DICTA so that the SAG would maintain one PCU for the two complementary&#13;
operations.&#13;

RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
LAND ADMNSTRATION COMPONENT&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    This component is designed to improve the legal security of land and forest tenure and to&#13;
begin the process of resolving tenure conflicts on forest lands. The objective is to increase&#13;
productivity and improve management of the resources while at the same time increasing&#13;
environmental protection. The primary means for realizing this objective would be through the&#13;
implementation of a legal cadastre and initiation of land adjudication processes in four priority&#13;
Departments. Implementation would include systematic development and application of&#13;
methodologies, technical practices, institution building and legal/legislative assistance in support&#13;
of the Property Registry (PR) Law of 1975 (which mandates that the personal PR be replaced by&#13;
afolio real-based system). The component would provide legal security within all land tenure&#13;
categories: private, collective, communal, national and ejido. In urban areas and small rural&#13;
communities (aldeas and caserios) surveys and legal investigations would be conducted to&#13;
provide the respective municipalities with the inputs needed to facilitate proper land adjudication&#13;
under the Law of Municipalities.&#13;
2.    Implementation would be in two phases, comprising five separate activities. Phase 1&#13;
(pilot) would finance: (a) the creation of a pilot land information base; and (b) background&#13;
analysis and participatory field adjudication of property rights. Phase 2 (expansion) would&#13;
finance: (c) improved registry services in decentralized registry offices; (d) training of the&#13;
employees and consultant staff of the federal and municipal institutions involved; and (e) a&#13;
catalogue of national and municipal forest areas entered into the PR.&#13;
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
3.    Land administration is the responsibility of a number of institutions. The Property&#13;
Registry (PR), an entity under the control of the Supreme Court, records deeds and transactions;&#13;
and INA grants titles to farmers settled on lands legally described as "agricultural vocation" lands.&#13;
The Department of Cadastre, an autonomous institute under the Ministry of the Presidency, sets&#13;
standards for legal surveys. Municipalities are responsible for maintaining legal cadastres within&#13;
their boundaries in return for taxation authority. The National Geography Institute (IGN) sets&#13;
mapping standards.&#13;
4.    Honduras has been implementing a land titling program since 1982, having granted more&#13;
than 77,000 titles to landholders (of which over 20 percent were female farmers) on formerly&#13;
public lands. The land reform program, which reached its peak in the mid-1970s, has assigned&#13;
land to some 2,555 campesino organizations, of which about 1,400 are still in existence. Data&#13;
from 1995 shows that only 395 of the 1,400 hold definitive titles to their land. Demand for titles&#13;
has risen sharply with the passage of the Agricultural Modernization Law of 1992 (AML) which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
reduced the minimum holding size eligible for title to 1 hectare. from the previous 5 hectares; this&#13;
minimum size criteria has recently been eliminated for land under coffee production. However, in&#13;
the absence of a reliable, systematic registry and cadastral base, past and future titling efforts&#13;
might be in vain, because the contribution of titling to overall land security can be rapidly eroded&#13;
as use patterns and ownership change, thus negating any long-term benefits from the land titling&#13;
programs.&#13;
5.    The current registry system is based on maintaining indices of parties participating in real&#13;
estate transactions. In effect it is a folio personal or registry of the grantors and the grantees in&#13;
land transactions. Such an index has little practical value since it consists solely of lists of names,&#13;
the lists being created solely as names are received on a daily basis. Subsequently, there is no&#13;
maintenance or updating of the list. The PR Law of 1987 mandates that this folio personal be&#13;
replaced by folio real. The folio real is a system based on indices of the land parcels themselves;&#13;
which would be a vast improvement over the current system. Physical data related to the parcel&#13;
would be registered and would be the base for accessing ownership data. The PR of 1987 is still&#13;
to be implemented.&#13;
6.    One of the obstacles to modernizing the registry is the poor quality and quantity of&#13;
information available. The current system is notorious for its general lack of information and the&#13;
unreliability of what does exist. They are three principle factors underlying this situation:&#13;
(a)   Parcels are not commonly registered - given the informal nature of tenure, tenancy&#13;
and the land market in rural areas, the majority of lands have never been registered,&#13;
and any transactions affecting them have by their nature not made them susceptible&#13;
to entry into the registry. In the case of national and ejido lands this is&#13;
understandable, as it is not the land itself that is in the market, rather the&#13;
"improvements" made by the occupant which are being sold.&#13;
(b)   Costs of registration - the services of a notary needed to register a transaction can&#13;
be a disproportionately large expense, particularly for small landholders in small&#13;
transactions.&#13;
(c)    Unreliable data - the registry information is actually of little use in many cases as it&#13;
is not in any way linked to cadastral data (i.e., the actual size and location of the&#13;
parcel). Thus conflicts between the registry's legal description and physical reality&#13;
substantially weaken the system's utility. Additionally, the technical system for&#13;
administering and maintaining the registry is antiquated and an unacceptable level&#13;
of errors occur in the daily data entry.&#13;
7.    A further impediment to the implementation of the PR Law of 1987 has been the lack of&#13;
sufficiently precise cadastral and juridical information to permit the construction a parcel-based&#13;
system. The situation is relatively better in urban areas (where a much lower degree of&#13;
uncertainty exists over location and ownership), whereas in rural lands the necessary juridical and&#13;
cadastral information simply do not exist. An estimated 75 percent of rural landholders do not&#13;
hold dominio pleno (freehold title) to their lands. What census data exists indicates a very high&#13;
degree of informal possession of lands, even among those with medium and large agricultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
holdings. In numerical terms (vs land area), the vast majority of untitled landholders represent&#13;
poor households occupying small family or sub-family holdings in national or ejido lands.&#13;
8.   In the past, most land surveys by the DEC had been conducted with the purpose of&#13;
identifying landholders who would be eligible for titling by INA, i.e. individuals resident on public&#13;
lands apt for agriculture use. For this reason, much of the landscape has been excluded from the&#13;
type of analysis that would allow for clearly identifying claims to land in rural aldeas. The public&#13;
forest land and so-called "sitiosprivados" have also been excluded, both of which include&#13;
complex webs of informal property rights..&#13;
9.    The DEC is presently under contract with AFE-COHDEFOR to carry out projects in&#13;
areas that largely or completely overlap four departments (those included in the component). The&#13;
DEC would update and verify the administrative limits which define national lands (See Bonilla,&#13;
Oct. 95, Actualizaci6n De Limites Administrativos y de Sitios en Areas Nacionales) in eight&#13;
departments, three of which - Yoro, Cortes and Comayagua - would overlap the component&#13;
area. Secondly, the DEC would identify and delimit forest land (tierras de vocaci6n forestal) in&#13;
all 18 departments of the country. This work should be concluded in each of the four&#13;
departments before the start of activities of the land administration component. Finally, there are&#13;
two other titling and cadastral projects, to be funded by USAID and CIDA, respectively, slated to&#13;
cover a total of seven municipalities in the Department of Olancho. Hence, the legal cadastre that&#13;
would need to be conducted for the purposes of land adjudication and property registration in the&#13;
framework of the present component would have a significant wealth of materials at its disposal.&#13;
PROJECT AREA&#13;
10.   The Departments selected for project coverage are Comayagua, Cortes, Yoro and&#13;
Olancho. Selection was based on occurrence of natural resources of economic and environmental&#13;
significance and evidence of rural land tenure conflicts in urgent need of resolution, and the&#13;
existence of a minimum information base. Cortes and Comayagua were selected as agricultural&#13;
zones with as yet unrealized (high) potential for export crop production. Long-standing tenure&#13;
problems in lands distributed under the Agrarian Reform in these departments have contributed to&#13;
the disappointing performance of the agricultural sector and to a potentially volatile political&#13;
situation involving the organized peasant population. Yoro and Olancho, both departments with&#13;
extensive priority public forest areas fraught with tenure conflicts, were selected in order to&#13;
provide support to the natural resource management component of the project. In total, the four&#13;
departments cover 41,441 square kilometers, or about 37 percent of the total land area of the&#13;
country. Olancho alone accounts for about 59 percent of the selected area.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
11.   Phase 1 (Pilot): Land Information Base. The methodology and institutional&#13;
arrangements for developing a modem land information base would be tested in a single&#13;
municipality in the Department of Comayagua. Following a brief evaluation, the program would&#13;
expand to the rest of the pilot area, which comprises the 15 municipalities forming the property&#13;
registry jurisdiction of Comayagua. The data base for the 15 municipalities would be generated&#13;
by a multi-agency team working under the direction of a land commission to be created under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
auspices of CODA. The cadastre and adjudication team would evaluate existing documentation&#13;
of land rights and carry out a land survey for the purpose of defining the mosaic of parcels&#13;
existing within the pilot area. A separate team, under the direction of the Supreme Court (CSJ),&#13;
would specialize in activities required to carry out the initial phase of property registry reform.&#13;
The system would seek to incorporate all land within the property registry jurisdiction, so that a&#13;
comprehensive land informnation base is generated containing all national, municipal, and private&#13;
lands. The information would be available to the municipal cadastral office for the purpose of&#13;
urban planning and real estate taxation.&#13;
12.   Phase 1 (Pilot): Legal Analysis of Information and Adjudication. This would be&#13;
carried out in priority forest areas as a key to removing obstacles to forest management and&#13;
protection. All interested parties (agencies and communities) would be present at adjudication to&#13;
give community witness to the process and thereby reduce conflicts. INA would play a key role&#13;
in the promotional campaign, given its installed capacity in this aspect of land administration. The&#13;
process would involve: (a) analysis of existing land information in the property registry,&#13;
cartographic and photo images and other documentation substantiating the legal claim to&#13;
ownership (title deed, proof of purchase, inheritance transfer, etc.); (b) field adjudication of the&#13;
parcels, whereby the implementation team (accompanied by all interested parties in the respective&#13;
community) would check the situation in situ, arbitrate rights, delineate boundaries, and identify&#13;
parcels eligible for titling under INA's rural titling program; (c) a parallel promotional campaign&#13;
to allay fears of property occupants, inform residents about the process and temporarily establish&#13;
a service to review and record documentation substantiating land claims or land rights,&#13;
complementary to the adjudication team's activities.&#13;
13.   Phase 2 (Expansion). At the end of the pilot phase, an evaluation would be carried out&#13;
by IDA and the Government to measure results and to make recommendations on technical or&#13;
institutional changes which would be needed before the program could be expanded. Compliance&#13;
with these recommendations would be a condition for implementation of the second phase. The&#13;
evaluation would also establish minimum implementation criteria, which would become the&#13;
conditions for continuing disbursement in any given municipality. These criteria would include an&#13;
agreement with the municipality on the formation of their implementation units, establishment of&#13;
local territorial commissions, extent of community participation in land adjudication and&#13;
maintenance of key technical standards. These criteria would be established during the pilot phase&#13;
evaluation review. A Municipality Agreement would be signed between SAG and each&#13;
municipality prior to initiating any activities in that municipality.&#13;
14.   Improved PR System. Based on the pilot experience, an improved system of property&#13;
registry would be designed and implemented. A "Direccion General de Registros" would be&#13;
proposed, to take over responsibility from the current PR and to enforce norms, provide technical&#13;
assistance to all registry units, and centralize cadastral mapping functions. The desired&#13;
modifications would be proposed and presented to Congress for approval before implementation&#13;
of the expansion phase. To support the new system manuals would be prepared on:&#13;
(a) procedures and formats for management of the land information base (folio real); (b) software&#13;
prototypes for management of the forms and information base; and (c) management of the&#13;
transition from the personal registers and the folio real information base.&#13;

would be considered part of the project investment costs and born entirely by the project. In the&#13;
initial compilation of PR records positive incentives would be given to landholders in rural and&#13;
urban areas to participate. These incentives would be based on municipal land taxes and would be&#13;
developed in detail by the project in concert with municipal governments. It would be the&#13;
municipalities themselves who would bear the initial burden of providing positive incentives in&#13;
anticipation of improved future tax collections.&#13;
16.   Training of Registry, Municipal, and Cadastral Staff. The managers and operational&#13;
staff of DEC, PR, and INA would need training. Training would be focused on the pilot area to&#13;
create a core group of people who would then be able to extend training to a wider group of&#13;
technicians and professionals. DEC staff would be trained in management of the cadastral&#13;
information being used by the PR, technical norms, and quality control, including development of&#13;
guidelines and manuals for private providers of cadastral services. INA staff would be trained in&#13;
administration of a simplified process of titling in areas with afolio real, adjudication and conflict&#13;
resolution, and community promotion. PR staff at national and branch levels would be trained in&#13;
new procedures and the use of new formats for the entry and updating of information regarding&#13;
parcels. It is recognized that, given the low salaries in the public sector, it may not be possible to&#13;
ensure continuity of personnel. The project would aim at periodic updating of skills, so that, even&#13;
as personnel change, there would continue to be a well-trained core of trainers and other&#13;
technicians to expand and maintain the system.&#13;
17.   Catalogue of Public Forest Lands. In conjunction with AFE-COHDEFOR, PR would&#13;
develop a registry of public forest lands and oversee their delimitation and boundary adjudication.&#13;
By law, AFE-COHDEFOR is charged with setting up the catalogue, but so far has been unable to&#13;
do so because of the confusion over land rights stemming from the lack of juridical and cadastral&#13;
information. This process would not seek to modify existing settlement and usufruct of national&#13;
forest lands, but to establish the legal boundaries of these blocks of ejido and national forest.&#13;
Where communities are settled on national lands of "forest vocation" (not deemed apt for&#13;
agricultural use), usufruct rights and management responsibilities would be negotiated within the&#13;
context of GOH's policy for regularization of the traditional rights of forest occupants.&#13;
Subsequently, those usufruct rights and these management responsibilities would be incorporated&#13;
into forest management plans, under the natural resources management component (below).&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
18.   Overall, the PCU and the ad hoc Commission established by CODA (see Annex 1,&#13;
Organizational Matrix) at the federal level would coordinate the land administration component.&#13;
The component would involve the following entities: (a) an Executing Unit, consisting of staff&#13;
from DEC and INA, and answering to the PCU, which would be responsible for carrying out&#13;
cadastre and adjudication work at the field level; (b) a Territorial Commission, comprising&#13;
representatives of INA, AFE-COHDEFOR, DEC, UPEG, the municipalities and the Executing&#13;
Unit, which would be responsible for coordinating participating institutions and arbitrating&#13;
conflicts that arise in the municipalities; (c) DEC, which would be responsible for managing&#13;
cadastre information, technical quality control of private companies, and establishing technical&#13;
norms for cadastre and adjudication; (d) INA, which would administer the titling program at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
field level and be responsible for promotional activities at the community level; (e) the CSJ&#13;
Advisory Team, which would ensure that cadastre and adjudication are carried out according to&#13;
the laws of the country; (f) the PR, which would reform the registration process and establish&#13;
information and computer systems; and (g) UPEG, which would oversee the implementation of&#13;
the component. The possibility of creating a General Directorate of Registry that combines the&#13;
functions of physical and legal property information and registration would be evaluated during&#13;
project implementation and might be implemented during the project period. A condition of&#13;
effectiveness is the signing of a Participation Agreement between SAG and the other&#13;
implementing agencies for this component.&#13;
FINANCING&#13;
19.   Total base costs for the Pilot Phase activities (Land Information Base and Legal Analysis&#13;
of Information and Adjudication) are US$2.06 million of which IDA would finance about 92&#13;
percent (US$1.89 million) and GOH about 8 percent (US$. 17 million). Total base costs for the&#13;
Post-Pilot Phase are US$9.7 million of which IDA would finance about 78 percent (US$7.6&#13;
million) and GOH about 22 percent (US$2.1 million).&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
20.   The cadastral areas used to define the scope of work would conform to the jurisdictions of&#13;
the respective PR units. However, the first target area in the Pilot Phase of the component would&#13;
be a single municipality, Villa de San Antonio, in the jurisdiction of Comayagua, Comayagua.&#13;
There is a total of fifteen municipalities in this jurisdiction. This initial phase would be used to test&#13;
and refine the technical proposal for the land survey and data management and the new&#13;
institutional arrangements to be put into practice. Following an evaluation of activities in Villa de&#13;
San Antonio in Project Year 1, the component would extend its coverage to the remaining&#13;
fourteen municipalities.&#13;
21.   The Pilot Phase would conclude with the evaluation of the need for new legislation or new&#13;
regulations to the existing PR Law of 1987. based on the findings of a evaluation of the pilot&#13;
phase to be carried out in Year 2 of the project. The advantage of a new law is that is would&#13;
update out-dated technical standards in the existing law and legally validate the new parcel-based&#13;
registry system, rendering obsolete the current system. Upon completion of the pilot evaluation,&#13;
the component would expand beyond the first fifteen municipalities into the six municipalities that&#13;
comprise the jurisdiction of Siguatepeque, Comayagua. Upon conclusion of these activities, the&#13;
first department in the country would have been subject to a systematic legal cadastre and the two&#13;
PR units in the Department of Comayagua would be providing the full range of services permitted&#13;
under the law and its regulations.&#13;
22.   Expansion of the component into new departments would be conditional on the&#13;
implementation of the pilot evaluation, and subsequently, mid-term review recommendations, i.e.&#13;
ensuring an adequate legal framework is in place. Work would begin in Olancho in Project Year&#13;
3 and Cort6s and Yoro in Project Year 4. Full implementation in Olancho would require 2.5&#13;
years and in Cortes and Yoro would require 2 years (assuming simultaneous implementation&#13;
activities in the two departments).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
23.   Community Promotion. A key element in achieving the objectives set out would be the&#13;
parallel implementation of community-level promotional campaigns designed to emphasize direct&#13;
contact with the target populations. These would be started in advance of the arrival of field&#13;
teams in each municipality. The campaign would give renewed emphasis to women's rights to&#13;
receive title through INA. Before passage of the Agricultural Sector Modernization Law women&#13;
faced clear discrimination in this regard. Given the historical practice during the Agrarian Reform&#13;
and, through 1992, in the titling program, women had a much less than equal chance of obtaining&#13;
title to land held by independent family farmers. Beginning with the pilot in Villa de San Antonio,&#13;
it would become common practice for women to take part directly in the field work as promoters.&#13;
Mechanisms would also be explored to encourage titling of holdings to couples, both of&#13;
customary and formal marriages.&#13;
24.   Juridical Cadastre. Unlike past efforts, no area or type of property would be excluded&#13;
from the cadastre. The goal would be for all parcels defined on the cadastral map to have a&#13;
corresponding entry in the PR. The results of the survey and legal investigation corresponding to&#13;
each property would be systematically prepared in digital format for final approval by AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR, INA or the respective municipality; or would be used directly by the PR for the&#13;
purpose of inscription in the new parcel-based system in the case that nothing more than the&#13;
verification of previously adjudicated land was involved (for example, the case of a previously&#13;
issued INA or municipal land title).&#13;
25.   Land Adjudication. In many cases, the field teams would only have to verify the&#13;
validity of legal data already on file and update the spatial data corresponding to the property.&#13;
The records corresponding to landholders eligible for titling by INA would be separated from the&#13;
data base generated during the field work and transmitted to the regional office of INA for final&#13;
approval and authorization of title. The data bases maintained by INA would be updated during&#13;
project implementation using the land information system. In urban areas, the cadastre would&#13;
supply data in a similar fashion to the respective municipalities. A massive privatization program&#13;
in the style of the rural land titling program is not contemplated. In cases where residents&#13;
(vecinos) do not have documentary evidence of private ownership or rights of usufruct, the&#13;
municipality would simply register the land in its favor and extend usufruct rights to the&#13;
possessors. The documentary evidence attesting to one's rights over urban property may or may&#13;
not be in the form of a deed and may or may not be registered. Apparently, the vast majority of&#13;
residents in the small communities outside of the municipal center do not have a deed (escritura&#13;
piTblica). They are much more likely to have a simple private document such as a receipt for&#13;
payment for a transaction realized in the informal market This makes the participation of the&#13;
assistant mayors (alcaldes auxiliares) important to the success of the project. In the case of&#13;
national forest lands, information would be made available to the AFE-COHDEFOR for&#13;
subsequent negotiation of usufruct rights and management responsibilities within the context of&#13;
GOH's policy for regularization of the traditional rights of forest occupants.&#13;
26.   Territorial Commissions. The role of the Territorial Conmmissions that would be formed&#13;
in each municipality where the project would be implemented (see para. 18 (b) above) would be to&#13;
help ensure that the population is adequately represented in the process of adjudication. The&#13;
Commissions would be informal bodies that could hold public hearings about the program, hear&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 8 of 10&#13;
complaints, and help conflicting parties come to an extra-legal agreement on property claims and&#13;
boundary issues.&#13;
27.   Technical Aspects. The principal method for carrying out the cadastre would be a&#13;
"medium-accuracy" GPS approach, although GPS units or other instruments capable of yielding&#13;
more precise results would be used in the principal urban areas (Comayagua, San Pedro Sula). In&#13;
the past, the DEC and INA have employed a photogrammetric approach using orthophotomaps&#13;
developed during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Graphical data identified in the orthophoto was&#13;
then digitized into a mapping system dating from the early 1980s. This system is still being used&#13;
along with the original orthophotomaps which are, of course, based on obsolete aerial&#13;
photography (See Brooner, 1995, 1996).&#13;
28.   Several factors relating to cost and institutional capacity affected the decision to avoid the&#13;
use of digital orthophotos or photo-interpreted vector line maps such that it appears reasonable to&#13;
use a more labor intensive and potentially time-consuming approach based on GPS and cadastral&#13;
mapping software. The negative aspects of using GPS (without the aid of new aerial photography&#13;
and digital orthophotomaps, as has been proposed elsewhere) are somewhat ameliorated by the&#13;
existence of a significant store of cadastral maps generated over the past 15 years which would&#13;
aid substantially in planning the field work. Secondly, since one of the principal goals is to&#13;
facilitate adjudication in the very uncertain rural environment of Honduras, it would in any case be&#13;
necessary for a field team to visit virtually every property. In this perspective, the time penalty of&#13;
using GPS alone may not prove to be very substantial. Lastly, an approach based on GPS, digital&#13;
mapping software, and standard relational data base technology stands a better chance of being&#13;
well managed in the present institutional environment. This is especially true given the substantial&#13;
reforms being contemplated for the DEC (started under the previous Executive Director) and the&#13;
PR. The technology required to produce digital orthophotomaps does not exist in Honduras and&#13;
it would add an extra layer of complexity to attempt to acquire and maintain this capacity now.&#13;
Nevertheless, an approach based on digital orthophotomaps should not be ruled out under more&#13;
stable conditions or for limited purposes sub-contracted to the private sector, such as the eventual&#13;
cadastral mapping of the Capital District.&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
29.   The receptivity of the intended beneficiaries of the project would be closely monitored&#13;
during the pilot phase. An analysis would be made of the real level of interest of small&#13;
landholders in accepting title from INA (keeping in mind factors such as the lack of available&#13;
credit and the perceived threat of higher taxes), the level of women's participation, and the real&#13;
capacity of the municipalities to benefit from the inputs to be provided them.&#13;
30.   The compliance of each institution with the agreements to be concluded before project&#13;
implementation would evaluated following the conclusion of activities in Villa de San Antonio, at&#13;
least once during the next phase involving the other municipalities in the jurisdiction of&#13;
Comayagua, and at the conclusion of the Pilot phase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
31.   An evaluation of the technology (GPS/GIS) selected for the cadastral survey and&#13;
information management requirements would be conducted immediately upon conclusion of&#13;
activities in Villa de San Antonio.&#13;
32.   The viability of the component depends on the legal validity of the proposed PR reform&#13;
given that the PR is the principal mechanism to sustain long-term land information and legal&#13;
property rights.&#13;
BENEFrIS AND PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
33.   Benefits. The reform of the PR would provide a mechanism to preserve the value of the&#13;
investment required to effect the cadastre and land adjudication process. In addition, several&#13;
other benefits should be obtained over the long term: (a) fulfillment of the basic purpose of the PR&#13;
(i.e. provision of legal security to landholders); (b) transparency in land markets; (c) provision of&#13;
the basic inputs required by municipalities to carry out town planning and implement fiscal policy;&#13;
(d) contribution to the efforts of AFE-COHDEFOR and the municipalities to control access to&#13;
and use of public forest areas; (e) provision of physical security for the PR data base by using&#13;
digital media and multiple back-ups; (f) provision of vastly improved services to the public,&#13;
including the potential for remote access to the PR data base.&#13;
34.   Project Sustainability. Failure to implement thefolio real throughout the country would&#13;
result in two non-compatible systems (current and new) being in effect. To manage this risk, the&#13;
project would assist in seeking new financing to complete the cadastre and the transition to a new&#13;
PR in the rest of the country. The funds necessary to extend coverage nationally would be&#13;
negotiated as early as possible so that the time during which two systems exist in parallel (though&#13;
in distinct parts of the country) is minimized. A plan of action for three distinct zones would be&#13;
drawn up: (a) Northern Region: Atlantida, Col6n and Gracias a Dios; (b) Central and Southern&#13;
Region: Francisco. Morazan, Choluteca, Valle and El Paraiso; and (c) Western Region: La Paz,&#13;
Intibuca, Lempira, Santa Barbara, Ocotepeque, and Copan.&#13;
35.   Given the limits on the national budget likely to be in effect well into the future, the&#13;
financial sustainability of the proposed parcel-based system is an issue. To overcome this&#13;
problem, the PR would be given budgetary autonomy and permitted to set reasonable charges for&#13;
services. Presently, for example, the charge for obtaining a "certificaci6n integra", which may&#13;
take more than a full day to compile manually, is equal to US$0.20. Moreover, the rate of&#13;
transactions captured by the system is very low. Statistics for the Department of Comayagua&#13;
provided by the local Registrar and the Director of the Municipal Cadastre demonstrate this fact,&#13;
as do previous studies conducted by USAID covering other registry units. For the PR to be able&#13;
to cover its own costs, including system maintenance and equipment depreciation, several factors&#13;
would come into play. First, the pool of users would vastly increase as a result of the cadastre&#13;
and adjudication process. Secondly, the productivity of the PR would be improved dramatically&#13;
on the basis of the folio real and the appropriate use of computer technology. Thirdly, the tariffs&#13;
for registry services would be brought into line with real costs without being made so excessive as&#13;
to discourage use of the system. The most widely used services could be made free of charge&#13;
(consultations) or priced at a very low rate (certifications); while the formation of new properties,&#13;
purchase-sale agreements, debts, and other transactions could be charged at a higher rate. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 10 of 10&#13;
possibility of allowing remote access and the provision of consolidated data, including cadastral&#13;
maps to institutions and municipal governments would also offset costs of operation. A separate&#13;
annex presents an illustrative example of the budgetary requirements and potential revenues of a&#13;
typical registry unit. Under reasonable assumptions, it appears that even the minimum registry&#13;
unit can be viable.&#13;
36.   The major disincentive to the participation of rural landholders is that all public rural&#13;
property eligible for titling must be mortgaged to the possessor at the so-called cadastral value.&#13;
This practice is mandated by the Agrarian Reform Law. Although INA offers the possibility of an&#13;
interest free 20-year term of payment, there would likely be a significant group of smaliholders&#13;
who would reject participation for this reason. That is to say, there are many smallholders for&#13;
whom any cash outlay, without immediately evident benefit, would appear irrational. In addition,&#13;
INA has established the practice of charging administrative costs to landholders who participate&#13;
in the titling program. (Presently, the rate is 75 lempiras - approximately US$7.00 - per&#13;
hectare.) This practice is not mandated by law and would be abandoned in the framework of the&#13;
present component.&#13;

RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
FOREST MANAGEMENT SUB-COMPONENT&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
1. The objectives of the Forest Management Sub-component would be to:&#13;
(a) place under management priority areas of national, ejido, and communal forests, including&#13;
support to defining the legal limits of public forest lands;&#13;
(b) promote the participation of local governments and rural communities in the&#13;
management and protection of the national and ejido forests;&#13;
(c) implement AFE-COHDEFOR's' decentralization plan (agreed with IDA under the&#13;
AGSAC) and develop their operational capacity as a decentralized agency; and&#13;
(d) promote forest planning and management among private forest owners.&#13;
MAIN ACTMTIES&#13;
2. To achieve these objectives the sub-component would target resources to: (a) institutional&#13;
development, especially strengthening the capacity of AFE-COHDEFOR at the local level to&#13;
manage national forests and respond to community needs; and (b) sustainable forest resources&#13;
management, especially building the capacity of local groups and municipalities to manage forest&#13;
resources and supporting applied research in natural forest management. These activities would&#13;
be executed in stages, and they would build on experiences of a number of pilot projects already&#13;
carried out in Honduras (financed inter alia by CIDA, USAID, GTZ, FINNIDA, World Wildlife&#13;
Fund, UJNDP and Norwegian aid) The proposed project would aim to cover eleven forest&#13;
management blocks (unidades de gesti6n) and 22 priority micro-watersheds within the forest&#13;
units. It is expected that the management activities in these forest areas would provide lessons&#13;
on expanding the pilot experience to larger areas within the policy guidelines of the AML. The&#13;
project experience should in turn influence other donor-assisted initiatives in adjacent forests and&#13;
foster more consistency in AFE-COHDEFOR's overall program of decentralization.&#13;
3. Institutional Development. In accordance with agreements reached under AGSAC, the&#13;
project would finance the decentralization of AFE-COHDEFOR functions to the regions and field&#13;
units. This would include: (a) establishment of an in-house training program for AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR staff in natural forest management and administration; (b) logistical support to field&#13;
units and regional offices in the form of standardized equipment packages; (c) information&#13;
systems to allow for effective decision making and monitoring of natural resources; and&#13;

(d) technical assistance, related to project implementation and specific critical subjects related to&#13;
natural forest management. Priority areas for technical assistance would include: upgrading&#13;
administrative systems and procedures (e.g., personnel, budgeting, supervision, development of&#13;
operational manuals); usufruct/tenure options and instruments for regularizing rights of forest&#13;
occupants and operating a social forestry program; cost/benefit analysis and recommendations for&#13;
modifying forest charges and regulatory costs; development of technical norms and regulations;&#13;
and implementing an improved environmental system of private and ejido forest regulation for&#13;
bureaucratic efficiency and reasonable control.&#13;
4. Sustainable Forest Resources Management. The project would support AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR and local communities in forest tenure, regulation and forest management. The&#13;
following main areas of assistance would be included: (a) forest tenure and usufruct (clarification&#13;
of location and status of national forests and their occupants); (b) forest planning for protection&#13;
and management; (c) forest inventory; (d) promotion, participation and public consultation;&#13;
(e) forest management; and (f) forest research.&#13;
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
5. Forests and Deforestation. Estimates of forest cover in Honduras range between 48&#13;
percent and 58 percent 2 of the country's total area, making it roughly second (to Nicaragua) in&#13;
terms of forest area and percentage forest cover in Central America. Almost 25 percent of the&#13;
remaining forest cover of Central America is found in Honduras. Forest types are about evenly&#13;
divided between broadleaf forests and coniferous forests. Broadleaf forests include a wide mix of&#13;
forest types ranging from lowland tropical rain forests to montane wet forests. Of the broadleaf&#13;
forests, lowland tropical forests are the most extensive, probably representing 50 percent of the&#13;
total. Reliable estimates on the annual rates of deforestation do not exist; the figure most&#13;
commonly quoted is 80.000 ha/yr (low estimate of 62,000 ha/yr) -- the overwhelming majority of&#13;
which is occurring in the broadleaf forest zones. The main causes of the deforestation are thought&#13;
to be the expansion of subsistence agriculture and cattle ranching in the lowland tropical forest&#13;
zones. In the coniferous forests degradation, not deforestation, is the process of interest.&#13;
Degradation of the pine forests is thought to be caused primarily by over-exploitation of timber,&#13;
high incidence of forest fires, over-grazing of livestock and unmanaged firewood collection. No&#13;
reliable estimates of the size of this latter problem exist.&#13;
6. Forest Sector Contribution to Economy. The relative contribution of the forest sector to&#13;
the Honduran economy has declined steadily during the last 15 years. In absolute terms, however,&#13;
the value of the production has remained almost unchanged. In the period between 1975 and&#13;
1992 the contribution of forestry to agricultural sector GNP shrank from 14.6 percent to 8.6&#13;
percent. During the same period the contribution of the forest industry to the industrial GNP&#13;
2 - The latest estimate is from 1990 (COBDEFORIGTZ) which concluded that a total of 5.7 million has of forest existed; 2.9&#13;
million ha of broadleaf forest, 2.8 million ha of pine, and 0.052 million ha of mangroves. Should deforestation estimates be&#13;
correct that would imply a 1996 forest area on the order of 5.2 million ha.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 3 of 15&#13;
shrank from 10.9 percent to 5.8 percent. Between 1980 and 1993, the annual volume of round&#13;
wood extracted by the forest industry was reduced by more than 60 percent to 0.9 million m3/yr.3&#13;
7. The potential, however, to increase the economic and employment contribution of the sector&#13;
is considered significant. With the reforms under the Agricultural Modernization Law (AML,&#13;
1992), macro-conditions exist which increase the potential forestry sector growth. Among the&#13;
most important reforms of the AML are: (a) changing the public sector role in national forest&#13;
lands from direct intervention in the marketing and harvesting of timber to one of ensuring and&#13;
promoting adequate forest management and providing oversight and regulation of forest&#13;
management activities; (b) returning state ownership of timber on private and ejido lands to the&#13;
legal landholders; and (c) requiring timber from public lands to be sold at auction. These actions&#13;
have, inter alia, induced increases in timber prices, so that they are now close to international&#13;
market prices.&#13;
8. The year the AML went into effect, the sector's contribution to the GNP increased by 5.6&#13;
percent. The following year (1993), there were no increases in GNP contribution due to a&#13;
declining trend in wood supplied for industrial use. This downward trend continues, complicated&#13;
by problems with the operation of the system of public timber auctions, by conflicts between&#13;
forest industries and the AFE-COHDEFOR over access to forest resources, and between the&#13;
AFE-COHDEFOR and local communities or groups over land tenure and the distribution of&#13;
benefits from commercial harvesting. Nevertheless, sustainable production of raw materials&#13;
(timber and non-timber), silvicultural activities and forest products-based processing (industrial&#13;
and artisanal) are considered to have significant potential for expansion. At the same time, it&#13;
should be noted that the extent to which expansion might be possible within a framework of&#13;
sustainable forest management 4 is not yet clear&#13;
9. Forest Management. Almost no Honduran forests can be said presently to be under&#13;
management. Nor is it likely that significant areas of forest could be brought under management&#13;
without the removal of several fundamental obstacles. The AGSAC has contributed to removing&#13;
two such obstacles through support of the AMIL's (return of forest ownership in private and ejido&#13;
lands to land owners and the municipalities; and policies which increased timber values to a level&#13;
equivalent with world market prices). The main obstacles remaining are those related to:&#13;
(a) tenure conflicts in public forests - lack of definition of the legal limits of national forest lands&#13;
and of the rights of national forest land occupants; (b) a distribution of benefits from national&#13;
forests which provides little or no incentive for adjacent communities' involvement in&#13;
management and conservation of the resource; and (c) technical and institutional inadequacies&#13;
making for ineffective promotion of conservation and rational management -- including the lack of&#13;
3 - The annual volume of timber accounted for by illegal logging is not included in this estimate as no acceptable estimates&#13;
exist; however, based on anecdotal evidence, illegal logging accounts for a large percentage of all timber harvesting. An&#13;
estimate of total volume harvested which included illegal volumes could be anywhere from 30% to over 100 percent higher. In&#13;
addition, the apparent contradiction between the value of production remaining unchanged and diminishing volume is&#13;
explained by rising timber prices. Between 1991 and 1996 pine timber prices rose in real terms by more than 300 percent.&#13;

10. Several current activities under the implementation in the AGSAC are providing general&#13;
support to improving the macro-conditions for forest management. These include: (a) land use&#13;
capability classification to identify lands best suited for forest uses; (b) identification and&#13;
establishment of forest management units in national forests; and (c) development of forest&#13;
management plans in priority areas of national forests and protected areas. These initiatives are&#13;
being carried out by the AFE-COHDEFOR with support from several bilateral donors. GOH&#13;
receives significant technical and financial assistance in the forestry sector from bilateral and other&#13;
donors. Almost all aspects of forestry (policy, institutional, forest management, and research)&#13;
have received and continue receiving attention, i.e., in forest management by CIDA, USAID,&#13;
GTZ, Holland and FINNIDA; in protected areas by CIDA, USAID, GTZ, the Netherlands, and&#13;
World Wildlife Fund; in social forestry by CIDA, GTZ, Norway, and UNDP. During the period&#13;
between 1988 and 1997 a total of US$63.7 million of grant funds were programmed for the&#13;
Honduran forestry sector (AFE-COHDEFOR, 12/95).&#13;
11. The USAID-financed Proyecto de Desarrollo Forestal (PDF - 1988 to present), FINNIDA-&#13;
financed Centro de Manejo, Aprovechamiento y Pequefia Industria Forestal (CEMAPIF - 1992&#13;
to present) and CIDA-financed Proyecto de Desarrollo del Bosque Latifoliado (PDBL - 1988 to&#13;
present) provide the current technical and experiential basis for expanding forest management in&#13;
Honduras. The projects are concerned with:&#13;
PDF - management planning and implementation, and sustained yield harvesting for large&#13;
scale-pine forest management on public lands&#13;
CEMAPIF - development and implementation of a forest management planning methodology&#13;
for smaller scale, more detailed operational planning in pine management units of any&#13;
size up to about 10,000 hectares, and training courses for professional foresters in the&#13;
use of the methodology. The CEMAPIF model is now the official AFE-COHDEFOR&#13;
methodology for pine forests.&#13;
PDBL - focuses on community-scale management of tropical, moist broadleaf forests and the&#13;
development of management planning and sustainable harvesting systems. The&#13;
project, which is still in the development and verification stages, has and continues to&#13;
make good progress.&#13;
12. All of these (and other donor) efforts provide an extremely solid base for advancing forest&#13;
management in Honduras. While there are many gaps left to fill, they do provide sufficient&#13;
experience, structure and direction to begin the long process of improving management of the&#13;
nations forests. A number of donors continue to finance activities aimed at improving the current&#13;
models for forest management (e.g., FINNIDA, GTZ). The current challenge for the AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR is to internalize the current level of understanding and begin replicating these&#13;
experiences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

13. In the next few years the most important areas requiring attention will be: (a) ensuring an&#13;
appropriate balance between timber harvesting and conservation on a landscape and forest&#13;
management unit scale; (b) integrating the planning objectives and data collection activities (types,&#13;
scales, sampling intensities) between the various planning levels 5 in order to avoid duplication and&#13;
unnecessary waste of resources on overly detailed sampling and planning; (c) reducing&#13;
unnecessary and unproductive administrative and regulatory costs which work as disincentives to&#13;
public and private forest management; (d) implementing a timber auction system which provides a&#13;
firm timber supply to industry while ensuring equitable access to raw materials to small-scale and&#13;
artisanal producers; and (e) developing financially viable and environmentally acceptable&#13;
management options in tropical, moist broadleaf forests.&#13;
14. Institutional Aspects. Most donor initiatives have been implemented through independent&#13;
project mechanisms which set them up as administratively and functionally separate activities from&#13;
the AFE-COHDEFOR. Thus overall impact on the institution's capacity to sustain management&#13;
activities has been minimized. Recently, as projects are been winding down (US AID), moving&#13;
into new phases Canada, or as some new projects have begun (GTZ' s forest management&#13;
program in Gualaco), there has been an increasing trend to attempt to integrate the projects into&#13;
the workings of the AFE-COHDEFOR. Many of the key personnel and technicians from these&#13;
donor-financed initiatives have also transferred back into the AFE-COHDEFOR.&#13;
15. As an institution in transition from its previous role as a state corporation for forest&#13;
exploitation to a state institution for forest management, the AFE-COHDEFOR can be considered&#13;
relatively new. During the last three years the agency has down-sized from over 1,200 staff to a&#13;
about 760 and re-structured its staff from 60/40 percent administrative/technical to 60/40&#13;
technical/administrative. At the same time, it has been defining itself operationally by establishing&#13;
forest management units (FMU) and delegating annual planning and execution responsibilities to&#13;
the forest region and FMU levels. Serious attempts have also been made to complete forest&#13;
management plans in priority FMUs, to consult with municipal governments and involve&#13;
community groups in forest management, and to change the bankrupt public image of the old&#13;
COHDEFOR. The institution, however, still faces a number of major challenges. Among the&#13;
more serious are:&#13;
(a)   its over-large and unfocused institutional mandate - by law the AFE-COHDEFOR is&#13;
charged with oversight, regulation and management of almost 90 percent of the&#13;
nations land area, which includes forest and non-forest areas and public and private&#13;
lands.&#13;
5- Current methodology includes 3 level of planning - master planning for the FMU (long term), management planning for&#13;
the individual forest stands or blocks identified in the master plan (medium term), and annual operational planning for&#13;
execution of management activities within blocks (short terrn).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 6 of 15&#13;
(b)    budgetary process requiring the AFE-COHDEFOR to generate its own income to&#13;
cover both overhead and operating expenses and which oblige the agency to focus on&#13;
economic and regulatory 6 aspects of forestry to the detriment of broader resource&#13;
management and protection roles;&#13;
(c)    lack of internal transparency and accountability resulting in part from: (i) job&#13;
descriptions and lines of authority being unclear; (ii) high turnover rates in managerial&#13;
positions resulting in unstable work priorities and objectives; and (iii) a lack of a&#13;
functioning personnel system to reward and punish performance diluting&#13;
accountability;&#13;
(d)    over-centralization of budgetary and decision-making functions resulting in extreme&#13;
bureaucratic delays and loss of initiative at field level;&#13;
(e)    low salaries making it difficult for good and motivated people to maintain themselves&#13;
in the institution;&#13;
(f)    lack of a functioning information system (collection, analysis, presentation, storage&#13;
and retrieval) leaving uncertainty over: (i) location, extent and tenure of forests;&#13;
(ii) forest resource trends and forest utilization; and (iii) disposition of institutional&#13;
resources to respond to identified management needs.&#13;
PROJECT AREA&#13;
16. Implementation would be phased over three years within eleven priority forest management&#13;
units (FMU) located in the Departments of Olancho, Francisco Morazan and Yoro (Table 1).&#13;
These units make up a reasonably compact, contiguous zone of forest lands in the north-central&#13;
area of the country. Due to the extensive forest resources remaining in them (for the most part&#13;
pine forest, with some zones of broadleaf forest in Olanchito and Culmi), these FMUs are of great&#13;
importance to local peoples and economies. This is reflected by the number of campesino forestry&#13;
groups that exist in the project departments. Based on a 1988 census of agro-forestry&#13;
cooperatives in the country, 55 percent of the groups and 75 percent of total membership were in&#13;
the projects departments. The extensive pine forests in the project areas are also of great interest&#13;
and potential to the national economy.&#13;
17. The basic criteria for definition of FMUs is the extent and continuity of forest cover, tenure&#13;
(public or private) and land area; FMUs are further sub-categorized (as Type 1, 2 or 3) depending&#13;
on the extent and condition of the forests within the unit. Type 1 units are those with the greatest&#13;
extensions of intact, contiguous national forest and constitute the top priority areas for forest&#13;
management. The organizing and definition of the FMUs (which is still on-going) is consistent&#13;
6 In addition to stumpage fees, the AFE-COHDEFOR has put in place an admniistrative/service charges to defray overhead&#13;
expenses. Under the current laws which require all proceeds from sales of public goods to be turned over to the Treasury, the&#13;
handling of these monies and levying of charges are of dubious legality. They also raise the question of their creating&#13;
disincentive to forest management.. .for which there is evidence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 7 of 15&#13;
with priorities developed under the AGSAC. A total of ten FMUs of Type 1 have been identified,&#13;
five of which are receiving support from other donors. The project would begin, inter alia,&#13;
implementing forest management plans in the remaining five priority FMUs in year 1 of the&#13;
project (Phase I). Based on the pilot evaluation scheduled for Year 2 of the Project,&#13;
implementation of forest management plans would begin in six priority Type 2 FMUs (Phase II).&#13;
In the first two years of the project only support for management planning and training-related&#13;
activities would be provided to these latter six units.&#13;

' The FMU "Olanchito" is in the Department of Atlantida, but administratively is&#13;
attached to the Yoro Forestry Region.&#13;
2 As yet no useful (though several conflicting) estimates exist of the total areas of the&#13;
Moraza.n, Catacamas, and Culmi FMUs; "project average" sizes were assigned for&#13;
purposes of preparation. Somewhat reliable estimates of forest area are available only&#13;
for San Esteban, Yoro, Agua Fria, Joc6n, Olanchito, and Talanga. Total forest area was&#13;
estimated based on mean percentage forest cover from known areas.&#13;
18. From a biodiversity perspective the montane tropical, moist broadleaf forests in the project&#13;
area are considered to be bio-regionally outstanding and of high conservation priority on a&#13;
regional scale; the lowland tropical, moist broadleaf forests and the mixed pine-oak forests are&#13;
considered to be bio-regionally outstanding and of moderate conservation priority on a regional&#13;

scale.7 Within the project area, the former types of forests are found primarily within the&#13;
protected areas system (some remnants might exist outside of the system in private lands) and the&#13;
latter types are found to a lesser extent both within and outside of the protected area system. In&#13;
broadleaf forest (both tropical and upland) AFE-COHDEFOR management objectives are&#13;
primarily conservation-related; where harvesting is permitted it is on a small-scale (non-&#13;
industrial), selective cut basis.&#13;
19. As with most of the extensive areas of public forest lands which remain in Central America,&#13;
the project area lies both near and within the most active zones of in-migration of poor families&#13;
(in search of agricultural lands) and of the expansion of livestock. According to various sources,&#13;
almost 75 percent of the deforestation between 1962 and 1990 took place within the region&#13;
containing the project areas and, almost one-half (48 percent) of the new pasture areas opened&#13;
between 1974 and 1993 were in one of the three project departments (Olancho). 8&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
20. The sub-component would finance: (a) institutional strengthening; and (b) sustainable forest&#13;
management. Base costs would be US$10.96 million.&#13;
21. Institutional Strengthening The direct beneficiary would be the AFE-COHDEFOR. The&#13;
main activities would be:&#13;
(a)    Training - focused on topics important to natural forest management and necessary&#13;
skills for the execution of work programs. A total of 12.6 staff years of formal&#13;
training would be provided to 82 persons (33 at FMUs, 24 at Regions, and 25 at HQ)&#13;
in four subject areas: technical aspects of forest management (4.5 person years);&#13;
administration and management (4.2 person years); communications and extension&#13;
(3.1 person years); and forest research (0.8 person years). An additional 2.5 person&#13;
years of advanced training for information system management and maintenance&#13;
would be provided to six persons, and financial resources for one staff year of in-&#13;
service training on-site at the FMUs, thirty national and regional-level workshops,&#13;
attendance at fifteen regional and international seminars and workshops, and for&#13;
training materials and publications.&#13;
(b)   Logistic and Operational Support - providing the minimum requirement of vehicles&#13;
and equipment to the project's eleven FMUs and three regional offices in order that&#13;
staff might perform their duties in forest management. Provision of equipment and&#13;
materials would be based on a standardized package of office equipment (furniture,&#13;
computer, printer, photocopier), and field equipment (truck radios, mensuration&#13;

equipment, forest fire fighting gear) to each of the FMUs and vehicles (4x4 double&#13;
cab pickups and motorcycles) to the FMUs and Regional offices. A small budget for&#13;
office rehabilitation would be provided to each FMU. At the central level a minimum&#13;
package would be provided for project supervision and administration consisting of&#13;
office supplies and three vehicles -- one each to the Depts. of Forest Management,&#13;
Norms and Control, and Planning (the latter as the implementation coordinator). All&#13;
costs for maintenance (vehicle, office and equipment), office supplies and per diems&#13;
for FMU and regional personnel (fifteen days/pp/yr) and national personnel (100&#13;
days/department/yr for Forest Management, Extension, and Project Coordination and&#13;
265 days/year for supervision by Norms and Control) are included.&#13;
(c)   Information Systems - this activity would support the development of information&#13;
systems for monitoring forestry resources and the forest sector. Two information&#13;
systems would be put in place: a forest information system (US$0.69 million) and&#13;
forestry statistics information system (US$0.145 million). The forest information&#13;
system would build on the existing system, AFE-COHDEFOR Geographic&#13;
Information System (GIS) established in a German funded forest information project&#13;
and develop it into a central data bank for the storage, analysis and presentation of&#13;
basic forest resource and inventory data, monitoring data (e.g., forest fire), forest&#13;
management plans and forest management activities. The investment would provide&#13;
equipment and software, develop and institutionalize data collection and entry&#13;
systems, and pilot conversion of management and inventory data into digital formats&#13;
in the three involved regional offices. About one third of investment costs would be&#13;
for purchase of aerial photography and image analysis. The investment in a forestry&#13;
statistics system would provide a small amount of office equipment and software, with&#13;
the majority of investment resources directed toward developing and institutionalizing&#13;
data collection, entry and presentation (dissemination, publications). Costs for office&#13;
supplies and maintenance of equipment are included in both information system&#13;
investments.&#13;
(d)   Technical Assistance- Table 2 provides a summary of the technical assistance to be&#13;
provided. Priority areas for technical assistance are those related to: (i) upgrading&#13;
administrative systems and procedures (e.g., personnel, budgeting, supervision,&#13;
development of operational manuals); (ii) integration of environmental impact&#13;
assessments and follow-up into regional and FMU forest management planning and&#13;
implementation; (iii) operational alternatives and usufruct/ten instruments for the&#13;
regularization of the rights of forest occupants and for the Social Forestry program;&#13;
(iv) community participation and public consultation; (v) cost/benefit analysis and&#13;
recommendation development for improving the current forest charges and regulatory&#13;
costs framework to make forest management more competitive with alternative land&#13;
uses (e.g., livestock); (vi) development and application of technical norms and&#13;
regulations which provide adequate resource protection without creating disincentives&#13;
to forest management; and (vii) refining and implementing an improved system of&#13;
environmental forest regulation in private and ejido forests, which is both&#13;
bureaucratically efficient and provides a reasonable level of control.&#13;

22. Sustainable Forest Management. The direct beneficiaries of the sustainable management&#13;
of forest resources activities would be the AFE-COHDEFOR and, in the project areas, the&#13;
involved municipalities, rural communities, local groups (e.g. agro-forestry cooperatives), forest&#13;
occupants and forest and timber industry. The objectives of the proposed activities are, in eleven&#13;
priority FMUs, to: (a) identify and demarcate the legal limits of national forest lands; (b) initiate&#13;
and support the process of regularization of traditional rights of forest occupants in national&#13;
forest lands; (c) involve affected groups, communities, municipalities and private business in the&#13;
management planning process and in the management of forests resources; (d) initiate the&#13;
implementation of the forest management plans through a decentralized AFE-COHDEFOR in&#13;
cooperation with relevant local actors; (e) increase the level of protection and productivity of the&#13;
forests through implementation of silvicultural activities (in production areas), control of forest&#13;
fires and increased forest vigilance; (f) improve the quality of the life of poor occupants and users&#13;
of public forests (national and ejido) by involving them in forest resource management activities&#13;
and direct benefit sharing; and (g) establish a stable flow of forest products (primarily timber)&#13;
from managed areas of pine production forest which is accessible by both small and large&#13;
processors.&#13;
23. The main activities in this area would be:&#13;
(a)    Forest Tenure and Usufruct. The objective would be to clarify the location and&#13;
status (legal and customary usage) of national forest lands and their occupants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 11 of 15&#13;
Investments would consist of: (i) mounting and maintaining a permanent database&#13;
(Catailogo de Patrimonio Forestal Inalienable) of all legal information on the official&#13;
limits of national forest lands, holdings and tenure status (forest and land); (ii) a&#13;
census of national forests occupants (eleven FMUs) plus participatory rural&#13;
diagnostics to verify census accuracy and identify length of occupancy, traditional&#13;
uses and perceptions of rights held by forest occupants; (iii) regularization of the&#13;
traditional rights of occupants of national forest lands, including mechanisms for&#13;
negotiation and conflict resolution; and (iv) delimitation and demarcation of 1,400 km&#13;
of national forest boundaries.&#13;
(b)   Forest Planning. The project would finance planning for forest protection and&#13;
management within the 11 project FMUs, including: (i) environmental impact&#13;
assessments and protection plans for approximately 545,000 ha; and (ii) silvicultural&#13;
treatment plans for approximately 120,000 ha.&#13;
(c)   Forest Inventory. In production pine forests, the project would finance: (i) FMU-&#13;
level forest inventories for approximately 300,000 ha; (ii) stand-level inventories for&#13;
approximately 150,000 ha; and (iii) annual operating plan inventory and marking&#13;
activities (for silvicultural treatments and harvesting) for approximately 150,000 ha.&#13;
(d)   Promotion, Participation, and Public Consultation. The project would aim for&#13;
transparency in state decision-making regarding public forest lands. Investments for&#13;
this purpose would consist of: (i) dissemination of information on public forest&#13;
management objectives, plans and activities in public forests; (ii) public seminars (85&#13;
total) on topics of importance to communities, municipalities, industry and private&#13;
forest owners regarding legal, environmental, social and technical aspects of forest&#13;
resources management; (iii) public awareness campaigns on forest fire, illegal logging&#13;
and private forest management options; (iv) municipal-level public consultations (25&#13;
total) on forest management plans; and (v) community-level public consultations (60&#13;
total) on forest management plans and annual operating plans.&#13;
(e)    Forest Management. The project would finance: (i) forest fire control (including a&#13;
system of fire watch towers) for approximately 545,000 ha; (ii) forest vigilance for&#13;
approximately 545,000 ha; (iii) silvicultural treatments for approximately 120,000 ha;&#13;
(iv) implementation of timber auction plans for approximately 30,000 ha; (v)&#13;
implementation of protection plans in 7 protected areas; and (vi) forest road&#13;
improvements/rehabilitation on 45 km of forest roads.&#13;
(f)    Forest Research would include data collection, analysis and presentation of findings&#13;
from permanent sample plots in support of upgrading technical prescriptions for&#13;
sustainable harvesting of forest products.&#13;

INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
24. The Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG), through the Project Coordinating Unit&#13;
(PCU), would be responsible for ensuring that the implementation and expenditures under the&#13;
sub-component were consistent with the IDA credit agreement. Details of the PCU and AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR responsibilities are contained in Project Operations Manual (Manual de Operaciones&#13;
para la Ejecuci6n del Proyecto de Administracion de Areas Rurales) which can be found in the&#13;
project files (Annex I). A Subsidiary Agreement would be signed prior to credit effectiveness&#13;
between SAF and AFE-COHDEFOR regarding the respective roles and responsibilities of these&#13;
two entities. A description of PCU responsibilities are contained in the main text (para. 3.2).&#13;
25. The AFE-COHDEFOR would be responsible for the following:&#13;
(a)   Overall Implementation - The Manager of AFE-COHDEFOR would be responsible&#13;
for all aspects of project implementation. The Department of Planning within AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR would be responsible for coordination of project activities and would&#13;
act as the PCU counterpart. This Department would operate under similar terms of&#13;
reference to those of the PCU (e.g., review budgetary plans, monitor budgetary&#13;
resources, supervise disbursement, procurement of goods and services, and audits,&#13;
etc.) in fulfilling IDA and credit agreement requirements.&#13;
(b)   Training - the Department of Promotion and Extension (DP&amp;E) is responsible for the&#13;
institution's overall training program. DP&amp;E would be responsible for developing&#13;
terms of reference for technical assistance in finalizing the training program and for&#13;
supervising it. DP&amp;E would coordinate with the other concerned departments in&#13;
identifying priorities and content of the training program. The Regional Offices&#13;
would be responsible, in conjunction with DP&amp;E, for scheduling training activities&#13;
and ensuring the participation of regional personnel.&#13;
(c)   Logistical and Operational Support - the Department of Planning (DP) would be&#13;
responsible for procuring goods and services to be obtained through local competitive&#13;
bidding or local shopping. DP would be responsible for ensuring that all procured&#13;
goods were assigned to the units for which they were intended and properly&#13;
maintained (including the keeping of trip logs for all project vehicles). DP would be&#13;
responsible for assigning adequate budgetary resources for per diems, office supplies,&#13;
equipment maintenance and forest management activities through the annual&#13;
budgeting process. Regional offices would be responsible for ensuring the&#13;
appropriate use and maintenance of all project procured vehicles and equipment.&#13;
(d)   Information Systems - the final institutional location of the Information Systems in&#13;
AFE-COHDEFOR is still in doubt. Until this issue is resolved, no disbursements&#13;
would be made for the implementation of these systems. In the implementation plan&#13;
no activities are scheduled until Year 2, other than upgrading the offices in which the&#13;
system will be physically located (for which the DP would be responsible). The&#13;
Department ultimately charged with responsibility for operating the system would also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 13 of 15&#13;
be responsible for implementing the activities -- developing terms of reference, hiring&#13;
of consultants, etc. All procurement of goods would be through the DP or the PCU&#13;
(depending on procurement type and amounts). The Regional Offices would be&#13;
responsible for integrating into the FMU and Regional work programs the required&#13;
data collection activities. In addition, they would be responsible for quality control&#13;
and supervision of data collection and ensuring its timely transmittal to the&#13;
implementing Department.&#13;
(e)   Technical Assistance - the DP would have overall responsibility for assigning the&#13;
technical assistance budget and contracting consultants. In the case of individual&#13;
consultants, the concerned Departments would develop terms of reference, participate&#13;
with the DP in consultant selection and would supervise consultant work, and final&#13;
acceptance of outputs. The DP would review terms of reference and ensure their&#13;
consistency with legal agreements and project objectives. For technical assistance&#13;
which deals with institution-wide issues and policies (i.e. administrative systems and&#13;
procedures, forest tenure and usufruct, and community participation and public&#13;
consultation), the DP would be responsible for coordinating and integrating the&#13;
technical assistance outputs with all relevant departments.&#13;
(f)   Forest Tenure and Usufruct - the office of the Catilogo de Patrimonio Forestal&#13;
Inalienable (CDPFI - with the Legal Office, attached to the Office of the Manager of&#13;
the AFE-COHDEFOR) would be responsible for seeing that all legal definition of&#13;
national forest lands stemming from (DEC) national forest delimitation activities and&#13;
the forest management planning process are entered into and accessible from the&#13;
Infornation System. The CDPFI would also be responsible for ensuring legality and&#13;
quality of delimitation activities; they would develop termns of reference and&#13;
agreements with the DEC over the actual implementation of delimitation activities.&#13;
Subsequently, Regional Offices would be responsible for seeing that the legal&#13;
boundaries are physically demarcated. All other activities related to contracting of the&#13;
census of forest occupants, participatory diagnostics, and related technical assistance&#13;
inputs (e.g., on forest tenure and usufruct) would be the responsibility of the DP in&#13;
coordination with the Department of Norms and Control (DN&amp;C). Supervision of&#13;
the implementation of the consultancies and follow up would be through the DN&amp;C,&#13;
who would also ensure that the information generated was provided to the CDPFI for&#13;
inclusion in the database. The Regional Office's social promoters would participate&#13;
directly in all census and diagnostics and would be the counterparts of consultants&#13;
working on forest tenure and usufruct issues.&#13;
(g)   Forest Planning, Inventory, and Management - the Department of Forest Management&#13;
(DFM) has overall responsibility for the implementation of all these activities. They&#13;
would be responsible for reviewing and approving all annual work plans developed by&#13;
the Regional Offices and supervising their implementation. The DN&amp;C would be&#13;
responsible for environmental impact assessment and for ensuring that its outputs&#13;
were integrated into the forest management plans; they would also serve an&#13;
independent audit function to monitor compliance with all relevant technical and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 14 of 15&#13;
environmental norms as well as general compliance with the management planning&#13;
framework. The Regional Offices would be responsible for overall quality control and&#13;
supervision of implementation activities and contracts at the FMUs. They would: (i)&#13;
develop the annual work plans and budgets for the region; (ii) be responsible for&#13;
preparing terms of reference, contracting and implementing stand-level and annual&#13;
operating plans and silvicultural treatment contracts up to a ceiling of US$20,000 9;&#13;
(iii) implementation of forest fire protection, forest vigilance and timber auction plans;&#13;
(iv) supervision and reporting; (v) development and approval of the FMU work&#13;
programs; (vi) fulfilling all reporting requirements both for the functioning of the&#13;
forestry information and statistics system as well as for meeting project supervision&#13;
requirements; (vii) coordinating with the relevant central departments in developing&#13;
terms of reference and supervising contracts for activities which exceed their&#13;
budgetary ceiling; (viii) coordinating with the relevant central departments in&#13;
implementing environmental assessments and forest master plans. The Forest&#13;
Management Unit personnel would be responsible for developing annual work plans&#13;
for submission to the Regional offices. FMU personnel would participate in and&#13;
supervise all activities and contracts for forest management planning, implementation,&#13;
and data collection. The FMU would also fulfill reporting requirements both for the&#13;
functioning of the forestry information and statistics system as well as for meeting&#13;
project supervision requirements.&#13;
(h)   Participation, Promotion and Public Consultation - The DFM would be responsible&#13;
for ensuring that overall implementation of these activities took place as an integral,&#13;
and required, part of the Forest Management planning and implementation process.&#13;
Implementation would be the responsibility of the DP&amp;E through the social&#13;
promoters at the Regional Offices for participation/public consultation, and the&#13;
central office for public information campaigns (e.g. forest management for private&#13;
forest owners, forest fire, etc.). The Regional Offices would be responsible for&#13;
organizing and implementing municipal and community-level participation and&#13;
consultation process in planning and implementation activities with the participation&#13;
of central DP&amp;E personnel.&#13;
(i)    Research - the DFM, as the Department responsible for the permanent sample plot&#13;
system, would be responsible for the implementation of these activities.&#13;

COHDEFOR in promotion and supervision of municipal and community forest resource&#13;
management activities.&#13;
FINANcING&#13;
26. The World Bank would finance works, goods, consultant services, and training as specified in&#13;
the Development Credit Agreement. The Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) and the&#13;
9 At mid-tenn review all assigned responsibilities will be assessed and budgetary ceilings and responsibilities adjusted as&#13;
necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

AFE-COHDEFOR will be responsible to maintain the budget for all recurrent and operating costs&#13;
after the end of the project period.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
27. The sub-component would be executed in two phases. In the first phase, investments in&#13;
actual forest management activities would be excluded in the six Type 2 FMUs; forest&#13;
management activities would only be financed in the five Type 1 FMUs. All other investment&#13;
activities (e.g., institutional strengthening, forest inventory, planning, etc.) would be carried out in&#13;
all 11 FMUs, 3 Regional Offices, and at the central level. Phase 2 of the project would begin after&#13;
the pilot evaluation (Year 2). Conditioned on status of implementation in Phase 1, investment in&#13;
forest management activities would be extended into the remaining six Type 2 FMUs. Progress&#13;
would be again evaluated at the time of the mid-term review and continued disbursements against&#13;
this sub-component conditioned on the implementation of the critical actions indicated in the joint&#13;
action plan resulting from that review.&#13;
28. During Phase 1:&#13;
(a)   first priority would be given to: (i) project coordination; (ii) developing terms of&#13;
reference and initiating technical assistance in key thematic areas (administrative&#13;
systems and procedures, environmental impact assessment and monitoring, forest&#13;
tenure and usufruct, forestry extension and communications, training, and community&#13;
participation and public consultation); (iii) training; (iv) census of forest occupants&#13;
and participatory diagnostics; (v) establishment of the Catalogo de Patromonio&#13;
Forestal in the first year of the project; (vi) public consultations and participatory&#13;
planning; and (vii) procurement of vehicles and equipment for Regional Offices and&#13;
FMUs;&#13;
(b)   second priority would be given: (i) developing terms of reference and starting&#13;
technical assistance in the remaining thematic areas; and (ii) forest inventories and&#13;
planning;&#13;
(c)   third priority would be given to: (i) executing forest management plans; (ii) research;&#13;
and (iii) information systems.&#13;
29. In each FMU the logical sequence for forest management would consist of: (a) clarifying the&#13;
situation on forest tenure, traditional rights of forest occupants and initial consultation with&#13;
affected groups; (b) forest planning including participation and consultation with relevant local&#13;
actors; and (c) forest management.&#13;

HONDURAS&#13;
RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
UPLAND PRODUCERS FUND&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
I.    The Upland Producers' Fund objectives would be: (a) to reduce the environmental&#13;
degradation of forest and soil resources in upland areas; (b) to improve the incomes and well-&#13;
being of poor, upland farming households; and (c) to establish a long-term financing mechanism&#13;
through which GOH can channel resources for extension and training assistance to such&#13;
households. To meet these objectives, it would finance: technical assistance and training for&#13;
upland farmers and to Municipalities; applied research in support of agriculture, livestock and&#13;
natural forest management for upland areas; and training of natural resources professionals who&#13;
provide technical services to upland farmers.&#13;
2.    The fund is justified because of the lack of GOH extension services to marginal upland&#13;
farmers and forestry groups, particularly women; the inseparable links between poverty, hillside&#13;
agriculture and forest degradation in upland areas; the overwhelming need to arrest soil&#13;
degradation and stabilize food production to ensure basic food security for hillside farming&#13;
households; and the continued environmental degradation caused by poor resource management&#13;
practices which is manifested in deforestation, accelerated soil erosion and overgrazing. This&#13;
annex describes the Upland Producers Fund, including: (a) activities to be financed; (b) clients of&#13;
the fund; (c) institutional arrangements to implement the fund; and (d) gender strategy.&#13;
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
3 .    According to the National Agricultural Census (1994), almost 250,000 of the nation's&#13;
320,000 farmers are subsistence producers, defined as producers with 5 ha or less of arable land&#13;
who do not have salaried employment. This group, which comprises over 75 percent of the&#13;
nation's farmers, occupies an average of 2.4 ha/household 1 and is for the most part occupying&#13;
hillside state lands. In many instances these households' production systems are closely linked to&#13;
forested areas, e.g. as a source of fuel, secondary food products, grazing/fodder, soil nutrients.&#13;
4.    The 1992 Agricultural Modernization Law (AML) created a new legal framework for the&#13;
state's provision of technology transfer and generation services. Under the new law these&#13;
services are to be substantially privatized with a "farmer pays" approach. As an exception to this,&#13;
services to poor smallholders on marginal lands would be provided by state financing. The same&#13;
I - The average figure of 2.4 ha/household gives an overly optimistic view of land distribution within this demographic group&#13;
as defined in the Agricultural Census. Some 25 percent of Honduras' rural population (1995 estimate of 3.1 million) are&#13;
reported to reside in households with no land or less than 1 manzana (approx. 0.7 ha) of land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 2 of 13&#13;
law created the Directorate for Agricultural Science and Technology (DICTA) under the&#13;
Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) with a mandate to design, direct, and execute&#13;
agricultural research and extension programs based on a rational balance between state-provided&#13;
services and services provided by existing private entities. The mandate also extended to the&#13;
creation and operation of such private service provision entities.&#13;
5.    The history of state technical services to poor smallholders on marginal lands is sparse.&#13;
With the exception of the recent USAID-financed LUPE project, which operated in 8&#13;
departments and cooperated with 42 extension agencies, GOH has had little direct involvement in&#13;
programs targeted to such farmers. Nor has GOH used its own resources to provide services to&#13;
this sector. The overwhelming majority of state funding in agricultural services has been directed&#13;
towards "farmers with potential", i.e. those on the best lands. By contrast, Honduras has had one&#13;
of the most progressive and successful NGO-based experiences in service provision to poor&#13;
smallholders on marginal lands, the most notable examples of which have been the works of&#13;
World Neighbors, COSECHA, and the Loma Linda Training Center. During the last 25 years,&#13;
Honduran NGOs working with smallholders have developed effective extension methodologies&#13;
and production techniques which show good potential for widespread application, replicability&#13;
and adoption. Based on anecdotal evidence and a growing body of quantitative evidence from the&#13;
LUPE project and other researchers, the production techniques appear to be quite promising from&#13;
income and environmental perspectives. The LUPE project was an attempt to scale up the NGO&#13;
experience and was successful in developing an excellent technical menu which is being adopted&#13;
and adapted by other programs and which provides a solid basis for large-scale diffusion to&#13;
hillside farmers.&#13;
6.    The situation with forestry extension for poor smallholders has been worse than that with&#13;
agriculture. The main entity charged with providing extension services, the AFE-COHDEFOR,&#13;
literally has no capacity or budget to do so. Some limited services have been provided to&#13;
organized forestry groups and a few communities through producer cooperatives and federations,&#13;
NGOs and bi-lateral programs. The numerous resin-tappers' cooperatives have received the bulk&#13;
of state resources directed toward forestry activities. A number of forest management projects&#13;
(some bi-laterally financed) have been working with communities in recent years in developing&#13;
environmentally acceptable, financially-viable forest management systems. In the pine forests&#13;
these efforts are much more mature. The most notable experiences with forestry and forest&#13;
management have been those developed through the PACO/CARE project (agro-forestry), the&#13;
CIDA-financed Broadleaf Forest Management Project with both natural forest management and&#13;
agricultural production assistance, and the GTZ and FINNIDA-financed community forest&#13;
management initiatives in the pine forests. In Honduras there is no lack of professional foresters&#13;
in the private sector who might provide services to communities in pine forest management. In&#13;
the project departments alone there reside over 80 foresters registered with the College of&#13;
Professional Foresters. For tropical broadleaf forests, on the other hand, there are few foresters&#13;
with any experience of note. The only exception to this are those relatively few foresters who&#13;
gained experience through the CIDA-financed project.&#13;
7.    An overarching weakness both for provision of forestry and agricultural services to&#13;
smallholders and poor communities is the lack of research capacity to backstop extension&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 3 of 13&#13;
activities. GOH, through the SAG, has no facilities to work on issues of resource management&#13;
relevant to smallholders. The Pan-American School of Agriculture at Zamorano, a pre-eminent&#13;
institution in Latin America for the education of agronomists, is not particularly strong in marginal&#13;
land smallholder systems relative to their capacity in more conventional agriculture. In forestry,&#13;
the main entities are CURLA and the National Forestry School (ESNACIFOR). The former is&#13;
starved of resources, while the latter has relatively good access to resources and external&#13;
assistance. Both CURLA and ESNACIFOR enjoy good reputations nationally, within the&#13;
resources that they command. In addition, ESNACIFOR is an institution of regional importance&#13;
as a trainer of forestry students. Currently, ESNACIFOR offers a "Dasonomia" as a terminal&#13;
degree; roughly equivalent to an Associates degree, one step below a Bachelors degree. The&#13;
major difference between the two is that a Dasonomo's studies have concentrated on technical&#13;
aspects of forestry rather than a broader (and longer) Bachelor's curriculum. CURLA offers a&#13;
University degree in forestry and ESNACIFOR is now developing that capacity. In the area of&#13;
research in natural forest management both ESNACIFOR and CURLA are weak. ESNACIFOR's&#13;
research capacity is as yet incipient and the bulk of what exists is not focused on natural forest&#13;
management. CURLA has developed some research capacity in support of its teaching activities&#13;
in broadleaf forest management.&#13;
PROJECT AREA&#13;
8.    The fund would give priority coverage to those areas within the Forest Management Units&#13;
(FMUs) supported by the Forest Management Sub-component (see Annex C.). These are located&#13;
in the Departments of Francisco Morazan (Guaimaca, El Porvenir, and Talanga); Olancho (San&#13;
Esteban, Catacamas, and Culmi); and Yoro (Agua Fria, Joc6n, Morazan, Olanchito, Yoro). In&#13;
addition to these areas, on a secondary priority basis, financing would be extended to eligible&#13;
communities in environmentally sensitive zones (i.e., protected area buffer zones, and critical&#13;
upper watershed areas) in the neighboring FMUs of Gualaco, Olancho and of Bonito Oriental and&#13;
Sabi in Atlantida. The justification for extending the coverage beyond areas directly supported by&#13;
the Forest Management Sub-component is: (a) these FMUs are either within (Gualaco) or&#13;
contiguous to (Bonito Oriental and Sabi) the project area and constitute high priority forest&#13;
management areas; (b) administratively, they all fall under Regional Offices included in the&#13;
project; (c) Gualaco contains two high priority protected areas (Pico Pijol y Vertiente&#13;
Occidental); and (c) Bonito Oriental and Saba are zones of humid tropical forest where&#13;
conversion pressures for agricultural usage are high and minor project investments in forest&#13;
tenure-related activities and agricultural extension are proven (under the CIDA-financed PDBL)&#13;
to be highly effective in significantly reducing deforestation pressures.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
9.    The Upland Producers' Fund would have a base cost of US$7.04 million. It would&#13;
provide financing the following: (a) technical assistance and training for upland farmers in&#13;
sustainable forestry, agriculture and livestock practices and to municipalities in micro-watershed&#13;
management; (b) continuing education opportunities to natural resources professionals who&#13;
provide technical services to upland farmers; (c) applied research to generate improved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 4 of 13&#13;
technologies in agriculture, livestock and natural forest management for upland areas; and&#13;
(d) establishment and implementation of a fund mechanism for directing extension and training&#13;
resources to upland farmers under GOH policy direction.&#13;
10.   Fund Clients. Clients of the fund would be: (a) groups of smallholders on marginal lands&#13;
(terreno de vocaci6n forestal) with a need to adopt sustainable production systems, with priority&#13;
given to groups that have not achieved food security at the household level; (b) communities&#13;
(indigenous tribes, aldeas, caserios, etc.) and local or grassroots organizations (e.g. agro-forestry&#13;
cooperatives, formal/informal farmer groups, women's groups, etc.) with the need for assistance&#13;
to manage areas of natural forest on national lands (under the Social Forestry program), ejido&#13;
lands 2, or communal forest lands; (c) communities responsible for managing designated micro-&#13;
watersheds for potable water production; and (d) for research funds, members of SNITTA.&#13;
Table 1. Fund Clients&#13;
ACTivITY                          BENEFICLARIES/CLIENTS&#13;
Technology transfer for smallholder      4,000 families would benefit directly; an&#13;
production systems in marginal lands.    estimated 10,000 additional families would&#13;
indirectly benefit.&#13;
Natural forest management.               2,500 families and 175 organizations would&#13;
directly benefit; an estimated 4,000&#13;
additional families would benefit indirectly.&#13;
Micro-watershed management               22 municipalities and about 60 communities&#13;
would benefit directly.&#13;
Applied research                         40 public, private and non-governmental&#13;
organizations that belong to the SNITTA&#13;
network would benefit.&#13;
11.   Gender Strategy.    The fund would provide opportunities to men and women farmers&#13;
in the project area by: (a) marketing the project to both men and women through appropriate&#13;
communications materials and channels; (b) selecting TA providers who have the capacity and&#13;
experience to reach both male and female farmers based on their priorities and needs;&#13;
(c) providing gender analysis training when necessary for TA providers; (d) establishing gender-&#13;
related performance indicators; and (e) ensuring that a male and female representative of farmer&#13;
groups is present in the Uplands Fund Committee. The project would support all types of&#13;
organizations, but the general strategy would be to integrate men and women wherever possible.&#13;
In situations where cultural conditions do not permit mixed groups, the project would support&#13;
segregated activities.&#13;
2 _For management of ejido forest lands it would be possible for project funds to be utilized to pay the salary of a Municipal&#13;
Forester under the condition that the groups eligible for assistance agree amongst themselves and with the municipality to&#13;
work in that maimer.&#13;
&#13;

12.   Technical Assistance and Training. Total investment (base costs) would be US$3.75&#13;
million. This activity would support initiatives in agriculture, natural forest management and&#13;
micro-watershed management. Eligible activities for financing would include: (a) technical&#13;
assistance and extension services by professionals (technicians and para-technicians); (b) farmer&#13;
training; (c) extension materials; (d) some agriculture and forestry inputs for communal/municipal&#13;
nurseries and the initial introduction of plant germplasm for conservation and soil fertility&#13;
management activities (seed, vegetative material, germplasm, simple agricultural tools, and agro-&#13;
chemicals); (e) communal and municipal nurseries; (f) operational expenses for extension workers&#13;
(such as per diems, fuel and transportation costs); and (g) costs of specific legal procedures (such&#13;
as assisting organizations to obtain legal status and usufruct contracts). Financing would be in the&#13;
form of grants to private technical assistance providers, based on technical assistance contracts&#13;
established between these entities and farmers, or communities and municipalities in the upland&#13;
areas. The project would not finance: labor (except for some activities in micro-watershed&#13;
management); credit; purchase of land; or other activities not described in the Fund Operational&#13;
Manual. Guidelines for preparing eligible fund initiatives are included as an attachment.&#13;
13.   More specifically, activities to be financed would include:&#13;
(a) for agricultural and livestock - annually updated extension and training plans, as well&#13;
as extension services and training as agreed to by participating farmers: (i) to manage&#13;
soil, water and fertility; and (ii) to increase agricultural and livestock productivity. The&#13;
types of technology that would be transferred include: green mulch; live barriers;&#13;
physical conservation works in concentrated flow areas; contour cultivation; minimum&#13;
tillage; improved crop spacings; windbreaks; composting/natural fertilizers;&#13;
alternatives to burning; artisanal seed selection; improved seed varieties; micro-&#13;
irrigation; appropriate use of chemical fertilizers; inter-cropping; pasture management;&#13;
live fencing; integrated pest control; and improved stoves. The project would finance&#13;
100 percent of costs of technical assistance and training for a maximum of four years&#13;
per group of farmers and an equivalent of US$600 per family.&#13;
(b) for forestry - annually updated extension and training plans and as well as extension&#13;
services and training, as agreed to by participating farmers for: (i) technical assistance&#13;
and training to develop and implement forest management plans (based on a Finished&#13;
technology project3 methodology) and market products from pine forests; (ii) technical&#13;
assistance and training in broad-leafed forests to prepare usufruct contracts, transfer&#13;
agro-forestry, forestry and agro-silvo-pastoral technology and reduce negative&#13;
environmental effects of traditional forest use; (iii) marketing plans of forest products;&#13;
and (iv) legal assistance to consolidate organizations and obtain usufruct contracts.&#13;
The project would finance 100 percent of technical assistance and training for the first&#13;
management plan and the first two years annual operating plans, 85 percent of the&#13;
costs of the third annual operating plan, 65 percent of the of the costs of the fourth&#13;
- The methodology was developed over the last five years in Honduras by a FINNIDA-fmanced program in Central America;&#13;
it is a forest management planning tool for pine forest management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 6 of 13&#13;
annual operating plan, and 50 percent of the fifth annual operating plan. The&#13;
maximum length of an assistance program financed by the project would be five years.&#13;
In cases where forest nurseries are called for under the forest management plan, the&#13;
project would finance a maximum of $1,000 per nursery for each management plan&#13;
over the life of the project.&#13;
(c) for micro-watershed management: (i) assistance (legal or administrative) to&#13;
municipalities to enter into contracts with AFE-COHDEFOR for transfer of&#13;
management responsibilities to the municipal government; (ii) environmental&#13;
educational campaigns to promote and sensitize local communities in watershed&#13;
conservation; (iii) technical assistance and training to prepare and implement&#13;
watershed protection plans (fire management and control); and (iv) technical&#13;
assistance and training to assist municipalities to generate and administer funds for fire&#13;
protection, and to strengthen local organizational capacity. The project would cover&#13;
90 percent of the costs of environmental education campaigns and promotional&#13;
materials; 75 percent of inputs for nurseries and management plans; and 50 percent of&#13;
fire prevention and protection programs. Micro-watershed projects may last a&#13;
maximum of four years, and the maximum financing would be $15,000 per micro-&#13;
watershed.&#13;
14.   Applied Research. Total investment (base cost) would be US$1.35 million. The project&#13;
would finance applied research to generate and disseminate technologies appropriate to upland&#13;
areas according to local needs and priorities. This activity could potentially finance research in&#13;
the following: (a) small-scale (community) natural forest management, including harvesting,&#13;
processing and marketing of timber and non-timber products; (b) non-traditional species&#13;
utilization; (c) hillsloped agriculture technology, particularly soil and moisture conservation and&#13;
soil fertility management; (d) improved small-scale livestock management, including practices to&#13;
reduce burning; and (e) integrated pest management. Institutions and entities who are members of&#13;
the National Research and Technology Transfer System (SNITTA) would be eligible to receive&#13;
research financing. Priorities would be set through a series of consultations in which the national&#13;
research policy entity (CONACTA) would participate.&#13;
15.   Training Of Natural Resources Professionals. Total investment (base cost) would be&#13;
US$0.45 million. The project would finance the development of: (a) training courses and&#13;
materials; (b) training of trainers; (c) seminars and workshops; (d) administrative and overhead&#13;
costs of training courses; and (e) a portion of the course attendees' costs. The training would be&#13;
focused on technical aspects of natural resources management (hillsloped production systems and&#13;
natural forest management) and on methodological aspects of extension and participatory&#13;
diagnostics, planning and evaluation.&#13;
16.   Fund Mechanism. Total investment (base cost) would be US$1.49 million. The project&#13;
would finance the completion of detailed design, establishment and implementation of the Upland&#13;
Producers' Fund. The activities to be financed would include: (a) completion of the procedures&#13;
manual, including preliminary testing of design and adjustments; (b) set-up of database of pre-&#13;
qualified consultants and management information system; (c) research and training prioritization&#13;
&#13;

exercise (i.e., series of consultations and workshops with clients and end-users); (d) honoraria and&#13;
per diems for Fund Committee members; (e) establishment and operating costs of Fund&#13;
Secretariat; and (f) contract of Fund Manager.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
17.  IDA and IDB jointly negotiated the structure of the funding mechanism with the&#13;
Government. IDB will be financing a parallel technology transfer and generation project targeted&#13;
at large, medium and small producers with potential (i.e. in terreno de vocacion agricola). It has&#13;
been agreed that the two Banks would use (if possible) the same finding mechanisms in order to&#13;
support the establishment of a GOH mechanism for channeling funds nationally. The long term&#13;
mechanism proposed by SAG/DICTA for channeling and administering funds is through the&#13;
creation of a foundation or trust. The IDB-funded project would have as a goal over its five-year&#13;
life the creation of this entity. As this would require a legislative act to constitute (which would&#13;
require several years to obtain) the project would begin implementation through an interim&#13;
mechanism. From IDA's perspective this simply means the SAG, as the entity legally responsible&#13;
for project implementation, would establish a committee (Upland Fund Committee) to approve&#13;
finding proposals. If a legally-constituted foundation or trust were set up in later years, the&#13;
Upland Committee would transfer to that mechanism.&#13;
18.   The SAG would have direct responsibility for implementing the Upland Producers' Fund&#13;
and for ensuring that the activities financed were consistent with eligibility criteria and with the&#13;
IDA Credit Agreement. For the SAG, this responsibility would be assumed by the Project&#13;
Coordinating Unit (PCU), which would review all proposals for compliance with the pre-&#13;
established eligibility criteria and the Credit Agreement. Following review by the PCU, proposals&#13;
would pass directly to the Fund for approval. The ultimate creation of the foundation or trust as&#13;
the administering and approving body would have no effect on the PCU's role to pre-verify&#13;
proposal eligibility.&#13;
19.   The SAG would vest authority to approve funding proposals in a joint private/public&#13;
sector committee called the Upland Fund Committee (UFC). Establishment of this Committee&#13;
and completion of regulations and procedures, including creation of a service provider roster, are&#13;
prior conditions for disbursement against this sub-component. The Committee would consist of&#13;
three sub-committees, each responsible for approval of: (a) agriculture/livestock proposals;&#13;
(b) forestry proposals; and (c) research proposals. There would be substantial overlap in sub-&#13;
committee membership. The UFC would have a technical secretariat consisting of a Fund&#13;
Administrator, two mid-level rural development/natural resources specialists, an accountant and a&#13;
part-time lawyer. The Secretariat would be charged with day-to-day oversight of the Fund's&#13;
workings, complying with GOH and IDA reporting requirements, and the approval of proposals&#13;
based on Fund policy, funding and an office-based review of technical content and viability, and&#13;
overall feasibility. Some sub-set of projects would be field-checked by the specialists.&#13;
20.   The Agriculture/Livestock Sub-committee would comprise 8 persons, one&#13;
representative from each of the following organizations: DICTA, Hacienda, SNITTA, AFE-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 8 of 13&#13;
COHDEFOR, Forestry Sub-committee, College of Agronomists, and two representatives from&#13;
farmer's groups (one male and one female). The Forestry Sub-committee would comprise eight&#13;
persons, one representative from each of the following organizations: DICTA, Hacienda,&#13;
SNITTA, AFE-COHDEFOR, Agriculture/Livestock Sub-committee, College of Foresters, and&#13;
two representatives from forestry groups. Both the sub-committees would meet every month (on&#13;
consecutive days) to review financing requests. The Research Sub-committee would comprise&#13;
nine persons, one representative from each of the following organizations: DICTA, Hacienda,&#13;
AFE-COHDEFOR, Agriculture/Livestock Sub-committee, Forestry Sub-committee, farmer&#13;
groups, forestry groups and two representatives of SNITTA. The Research Sub-committee&#13;
would meet every quarter to review financing requests. Review in all cases would be of packages&#13;
rather than individual projects per se and the purpose of the review would be to ensure&#13;
compliance with Fund policies.&#13;
21.   A qualified Fund Manager would be selected by competitive bidding. Eligible entities&#13;
would include nationally-based entities such as private firms, NGOs, or universities. The Fund&#13;
Manager would be selected based on capacity and experience to work with subsistence farmers in&#13;
agriculture, forestry and natural resources projects and with intermediary organizations such as&#13;
NGOs. Final selection would be with IDA approval. The Fund Manager would be established in&#13;
Tegucigalpa. Nationally, the Fund Manager would consist of a Director/Administrator and a&#13;
four-person technical unit of comprised of project specialists (i.e. generalists with rural&#13;
development, natural resources management and forestry/agriculture experience) with at least&#13;
five years' experience. The Fund Manager would be responsible for promoting the fund;&#13;
determining the eligibility of private TA providers; screening technical proposals; identifying&#13;
training needs of private TA providers; supervising activities supported by the Fund and&#13;
approving disbursement requests; and maintaining administrative, management and monitoring&#13;
systems. The contract for the Fund Manager would be renewable yearly, based on performance.&#13;
22.   Funds would be maintained in an account in a private bank. The bank would disburse&#13;
resources to the TA providers following direction from the Fund Manager. The Bank would&#13;
provide those financial, accounting and administrative services which would normally be provided&#13;
to a major depositor.&#13;
23.   Private sector TA providers, such as NGOs, would provide the actual services to eligible&#13;
groups. A number of capable NGOs are already operating in the region and could potentially&#13;
participate in the project as TA providers, such as World Neighbors, CIDICCO, COSECHA, and&#13;
FAMA. These organizations have been successful in developing and transferring innovative&#13;
agricultural technologies to upland farmers in Honduras. To be eligible to serve as a TA provider,&#13;
organizations must: (a) have experience working with upland farmers (or other marginal farmers)&#13;
in the area in agriculture and natural resources activities; (b) have a presence in the Upland Area;&#13;
(c) demonstrate the use of suitable participatory methods; (d) have a signed contract for services&#13;
with the beneficiary farmers; (e) comply with GOH legal requirements for government&#13;
contractors, and (f) demonstrate administrative and technical capacity to implement a Fund&#13;
contract. Eligible TA providers could include: NGOs, private companies, independent extension&#13;
agents, and member producer organizations (such as indigenous federations and cooperatives).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;

Disbursements to service providers would be authorized by the client group based on satisfaction&#13;
with services provided.&#13;
24.   The Fund would emphasize information systems as a strategy for achieving internal and&#13;
external credibility. The Fund Manager would create a micro-computer management information&#13;
system that would contain: basic financial and administrative information on Fund activities; a&#13;
data base of unit costs for standard investments; quality indicators; and supervision data.&#13;
Information on clientele would be desegregated by gender to generate information on the needs&#13;
and behaviors of different groups by gender.&#13;
FINANCING&#13;
25.   Of the total project base cost of US$7.04 million, IDA would finance 93 percent and GOH&#13;
7 percent.&#13;

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
26.   At project startup, the PCU would let a contract to a private consulting firms to finalize&#13;
the draft Fund Procedures Manual. This would necessarily include consultations with potential&#13;
service providers and client groups over adequacy, flexibility and responsiveness of the Fund&#13;
procedures. At the same time, DICTA, in cooperation with the PCU, would activate the Fund&#13;
Manager contract, establish the Fund Secretariat, and with the support of the SAG and&#13;
CONACTA, constitute the Upland Fund Committee and begin to implement the Fund regulations.&#13;
The Fund Secretariat's first priority would be to prioritize research and training.&#13;
27.   Upon contracting, the Fund Manager's priority activities would be those associated with&#13;
setting up the database of pre-qualified consultants, the management information system, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 10 of 13&#13;
initiating the promotion of the fund. The development and financing of individual proposals&#13;
would follow the following scheme:&#13;
(a) The Fund Manager, DICTA regional personnel and AFE-COHDEFOR regional and&#13;
forestry personnel promote access to the Fund by local groups.&#13;
(b) Client and service provider jointly develop proposal.&#13;
(c) Proposals are passed directly to the Fund Manager for review. Review based on&#13;
funding and eligibility criteria, and field-based review of technical content and viability,&#13;
implementation capacity, and overall feasibility.&#13;
(d) Projects for IDA financing are passed to PCU for approval based on consistency with&#13;
project legal agreement.&#13;
(e) PCU passes eligible projects to the Technical Secretariat for approval based on&#13;
consistency with Fund policy, funding and eligibility criteria, and office-based review&#13;
of technical content and viability, and overall feasibility. Some sub-set of projects to&#13;
be field-checked.&#13;
(f) On a monthly basis, packages of projects are passed to the Fund Committee for&#13;
approval based on Fund policy. Technical questions can be raised requiring further&#13;
clarification by Fund Manager or client/service provider.&#13;
(g) Approval for project financing is given to Fund Manager. Financing approval&#13;
authority is based on disbursements against advances in approved annual work&#13;
program.&#13;
(h) Fund Manager authorizes bank disbursement of first tranche to service providers&#13;
account.&#13;
(i) Subsequent disbursements would be authorized by Fund Manager against advances in&#13;
annual work plan. These disbursements to the service provider would, however, be&#13;
conditioned on the client group's satisfaction with the quality of the services provided&#13;
(i.e. the client group must approve the disbursement). With forestry projects involving&#13;
forest management plans, disbursement to the service provider would first be&#13;
conditioned on the management plan's approval by AFE-COHDEFOR.&#13;
27.   criteria for client eligibility would include:&#13;
(a) geographical eligibility - for the life of the project, residents of the following Forest&#13;
Management areas would be eligible: Olanchito, Yoro; Yoro, Yoro; Agua Fria, Yoro;&#13;
Joc6n, Yoro; and San Esteban, Olancho. For Years 2.5-5 of the project, residents of&#13;
the following Forest Management Areas would be eligible: Gualaco, Olancho; Bonito&#13;
Oriental, Atlantida; Sabi, Atlantida; Morazan, Yoro; Catacamas, Olancho; Culmi,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(b) Clients must be located in areas deemed "forest vocation".&#13;
(c) Clients must not be eligible for financing from other technology transfer services.&#13;
(d) Clients must not be involved in other projects or programs with actions and activities&#13;
similar to those financed by this Sub-component.&#13;
(e) Clients must be organized in a group.&#13;
(f) For financing under micro-watershed management activities, areas must be "declared&#13;
watersheds" (i.e., designated as protected areas because of their importance for&#13;
potable water production).&#13;
(g) All proposals must include: (i) a signed agreement between the service provider and&#13;
the group; (ii) the results of a preliminary, participatory diagnostic and priority setting;&#13;
(iii) a list and CV of all persons to be paid under the contract; (iv) a list of the clients;&#13;
and (v) details of activities, goals, costs, impacts/benefits expected, and an general&#13;
multi-year plan with a detailed first-year plan with activities and costs by month.&#13;
(h) For agricultural/livestock proposals, there would be a maximum of 25 families per&#13;
group with a maximum of 20 groups or 500 families per proposal.&#13;
(i) For forestry proposals involving forest management, the unit would be the area of the&#13;
forest management plan.&#13;
29.   Based on the outcome of the priority setting exercises, carried out under contract to and&#13;
supervised by the Fund Secretariat, competitive bidding would be carried out to let contracts for&#13;
development of curricula and implementation of field-oriented training courses for:&#13;
(a) participatory diagnostics and project preparation; (b) technical and methodological aspects of&#13;
hillside and forestry management systems; and (c) participatory project monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
It is expected that contract sizes would be highly variable and range from programmatic (from&#13;
institutions, e.g. ESNACIFOR, Zamorano, Loma Linda Training Center) to topic specific (by&#13;
NGOs).&#13;
BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
30.   Substantial benefits are expected to accrue to the projects direct and indirect beneficiaries.&#13;
Experience in Honduras with World Neighbor, COSECHA and LUPE projects have&#13;
demonstrated average project yield increases of 300 percent in basic grain production within three&#13;
years of adopting the basic elements of the extension menu. According to a review of LUPE and&#13;
World Neighbors, both have successfully increased maize production on hillside farms on average&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 12 of 13&#13;
from 700 kg/ha to 2,000 kg/ha (Mausolff and Farber, 1995) with minimal increases in labor and&#13;
cash inputs. As over 50 percent of Honduras basic grain production (maize and frijol) is&#13;
produced on hillside farms, the potential economic impacts are also substantial.&#13;
31.   Sustainably increasing basic grain production and securing food supply at the farm level&#13;
would also be expected to have large secondary impacts. First, stabilizing basic grain production&#13;
in hillside farming systems is, generally speaking, a pre-requisite to making any other&#13;
improvements in the farming system; i.e. it will open space, both in terms of labor and land for the&#13;
household to dedicate to other enterprises.&#13;
32.   The technologies adopted to increase yield have significant impacts on soil loss. LUPE&#13;
project data has shown that with the adoption of vetiver hedgerows, green mulch, contour&#13;
cultivation, and minimum tillage that basic grain production can be sustained on slopes up to 60&#13;
percent (upper limit of data collection). One element of this was a reduction of average soil losses&#13;
to less than 15 t/ha/yr..&#13;
33.   Risks. The main risks are those associated with: (a) inadequate capacity at the national&#13;
level to administer and implement the fund and at the local level to provide services; and (b)&#13;
political interference resulting in funds being directed away from the intended beneficiaries. Risks&#13;
associated with capacity at the national level are managed through reliance on an open contracting&#13;
process to select the Fund Manager, who is the most critical entity in the implementation. It is&#13;
assumed that capable entities exist in Honduras to comply with the Fund Manager TOR on the&#13;
observation that there are a number of other funds currently functioning using local capacity. The&#13;
Inter-American Foundation's Fund Manager is one example of a local firm successfully managing&#13;
what is essentially the same set of activities proposed here. The issue of local capacity is managed&#13;
through inclusion of training specifically for this purpose and maintaining the option after the first&#13;
six months of implementation to contract service providers as an interim mechanism. The risk of&#13;
political interference is managed to the extent possible by creating an Upland Fund Committee&#13;
which represents more diverse interests and placing outside of a line agency, by development of&#13;
the management information system which will allow project clientele, geographic location and&#13;
activities to be monitored and supervised.&#13;

HONDURAS&#13;
RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
BIODIVERS1TY CONSERVATION SUB-COMPONENT&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The Biodiversity Conservation sub-component would finance activities designed to assist&#13;
the Government of Honduras to bring priority areas of the country's protected area system&#13;
(Sistema Nacional de Areas Protegidas de Honduras; SINAPH) under effective conservation and&#13;
management regimes. In this context "priority" is based on biological values. The general&#13;
objectives of the sub-component are to assist in developing an effective, functioning protected&#13;
areas system which: (a) is capable of generating a significant portion of the income required to&#13;
sustain management efforts, and (b) prioritizes federal resource allocation to those sites with&#13;
national and international significance for biodiversity&#13;
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
2.    IDA involvement in the environmental sector in Honduras began in 1992 with the&#13;
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (AGSAC; Cr. 2540-HO) and with the Environmental&#13;
Development Project (Cr. 2693-HO) and continues with the proposed Natural Resources&#13;
Management and Land Administration project. This biodiversity sub-component complements&#13;
initiatives in these earlier projects and of bilateral donors such as USAID and GTZ to strengthen&#13;
the national system of protected areas and help develop a realistic Biodiversity Strategy. Under&#13;
the AGSAC, 15 operational plans were prepared for key protected areas with USAID assistance&#13;
3.    While reliable information on deforestation in Honduras does not exist (rate, location,&#13;
underlying causes), it is known that rates of forest loss are significant (best estimates are between&#13;
62,000 ha and 80.000 ha/yr) and represent an annual loss in the order of 1 percent to 1.5 percent&#13;
of total forest cover. In biodiversity terms, however, "percentage loss of total forest cover" does&#13;
not present the entire picture. Apparently, the majority of deforestation in Honduras is occurring&#13;
in broadleaf forest zones and, more specifically, in lowland tropical forests. Expansion of&#13;
subsistence agriculture and cattle ranching have been reported as the primary agents. This implies&#13;
that the annual percentage loss within broadleaf forest communities -- which are of greater&#13;
significance from a biodiversity perspective than the coniferous forests -- is much higher than the&#13;
average national rate and is conceivably twice or more than the national figure.&#13;
4.    Biodiversity Values in Honduras. While biodiversity in Honduras is among the least&#13;
inventoried in Central America, the few available figures illustrate that there should be no doubt as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
to its significance nor to the degree of threat it faces. The number of species of vascular plants&#13;
has been estimated at 5,000, of which 148 are either endemic or whose range is restricted to&#13;
northern Central America. The conservation status of 35 of these latter species is considered as&#13;
"threatened". The bird list for the country includes 710 species, 59 of which are threatened on a&#13;
national level and 5 are in danger of extinction. The mammal list counts 195 species, including 19&#13;
threatened species and 8 in danger of extinction. Some 170 species of reptiles are listed for the&#13;
country, 15 of which are threatened and 4 in danger of extinction. The amphibians list includes 75&#13;
species with 12 threatened species. The species lists of vertebrates for the country, while&#13;
somewhat shorter than those for Costa Rica, are nevertheless considerable. If one considers that&#13;
Costa Rica is now the best inventoried country in Central America, the less favorable comparison&#13;
(in numeric terms) with Honduras may only be an artifact of lack of data. The coral reefs&#13;
surrounding the three Bay Islands and the numerous cays (keys) off the Atlantic cost are also of&#13;
high biological significance.&#13;
5.   The tropical moist broadleaf forests of the Honduran montane zones are considered&#13;
endangered, bio-regionally outstanding, and of high priority for conservation at the regional-scale.&#13;
The tropical moist broadleaf forests of the Atlantic and the pine-oak montane are considered&#13;
vulnerable, bio-regionally outstanding, and of moderate priority for conservation at the regional&#13;
scale. The former type of forest is found primarily within the protected areas system and the latter&#13;
types are found both within and outside of the protected areas systems, though in the case of&#13;
pine/oak forest its conservation status is less clear. All are of key importance to the Central&#13;
American Region as part of the Meso-American Biological Corridor concept, and have been&#13;
prioritized by the Central American presidents for conservation efforts. The GOH has requested&#13;
complementary GEF financing for preparation of a joint UNDP/WB executed investment project&#13;
to focus on sites of high priority for conservation within the corridor and to complement this sub-&#13;
component's focus on sites of high economic potential to generate resources for maintaining&#13;
minimum administrative infrastructure. The preparation of this and the GEF project have been a&#13;
vehicle for advancing a coordinated dialogue on the best approach for implementing the National&#13;
Biodiversity Strategy.&#13;
6.   Protected Area System. Currently there are 107 areas listed as being within SINAPH,&#13;
which is a system legally established within the Ley General del Ambiente, Decreto 104-93. Only&#13;
about a half of the areas which comprise the SINAPH have a legal declaration providing a solid&#13;
basis for their protection. In total, the SINAPH covers some 1.6 million ha or about 14 percent&#13;
of the country's land area. There are 8 management categories or administrative designations&#13;
within tne protected area system.&#13;
7.   There is fairly substantial agreement that the current definition of the SINAPH leaves&#13;
something to be desired. However, there has been little accomplished to date which might lead to&#13;
achieving agreement on what should constitute a "rationalized" or "minimum adequate" protected&#13;
areas system. The current system contains significant areas which, from a national or international&#13;
perspective, no longer contain the biological values for which they were initially included as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
protected areas. In addition, many areas have been designated, not primarily for their biological&#13;
values, but for other objectives of national or local interest (e.g., all forest above 1,800 m for their&#13;
watershed protection functions). Also, the SINAPH does not fully represent the entire range of&#13;
biodiversity and landscape values that would be desirable (e.g. deciduous dry forest and&#13;
mangroves are substantially under-represented). It must be noted that while there exists little&#13;
rationale from the national or international biodiversity perspectives to maintain some current&#13;
areas in the SINAPH, for many such areas there are likely to be compelling local or broader&#13;
natural resource conservation arguments for maintaining their status as "protected".&#13;
8.   Many of the remaining high value areas in the SINAPH are located in zones which are&#13;
sparsely populated relative to the rest of the country (i.e. the Departments of Colon, Gracias a&#13;
Dios, and Olancho) and are the homes of a significant percentage of the countries indigenous&#13;
peoples (i.e. the Garifunas, Misquitos, Sumos, and Payas). These areas are now thought to be&#13;
under heavy pressure from encroachment by poor and landless peoples from other parts of the&#13;
country. Given that population is growing at 3 percent per annum (with 40 percent of the&#13;
population below the age of 14) and mobility is increasing, current rates of encroachment and&#13;
forest clearing can be expected to at least remain the same, if not increase, over the medium term.&#13;
9.   Institutionally, the SINAPH's management and protection is the responsibility of the&#13;
Department of Protected Areas and Wildlife (DAPVS) in the National Forest Agency (AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR). The total staff of the DAPVS is about 60 persons -- which includes all staff in the&#13;
protected areas themselves, the regional AFE-COHDEFOR offices and at headquarters. Only&#13;
very few protected areas have any permanent field staff. Three of the protected areas are&#13;
administered by skeleton field staff of NGOs and one area is administered by the Municipal Water&#13;
Utility of San Pedro Sula. Very few of the protected areas could be considered as being under a&#13;
DAPVS management regime which provides a minimum adequate control.&#13;
PROJECT AREA&#13;
10.   In the absence of national consensus upon what might constitute a redefined or&#13;
rationalized SINAPH, it was agreed with GOH that the IDA project would focus investments on&#13;
areas which retain significant portions of their natural habitats which are of outstanding value for&#13;
economic reasons (income generation potential) to complement the GEF project's focus on high&#13;
biodiversity priorities. There is a high degree of certainty that in any future, rationalized SINAPH&#13;
these "core areas" would still maintain a top priority status. To identify these areas reconnaissance&#13;
flights and field inspections were carried out that covered almost all 105 protected areas. Areas&#13;
with more than 90 percent unaltered vegetation in their core areas and with little or no permanent&#13;
habitations were considered to qualify as core areas. Areas with less than 75 percent natural&#13;
vegetation and considerable human presence in their core areas were considered to qualify as&#13;
areas of regional biodiversity potential for their biodiversity value. These latter would also have&#13;
additional values for other management objectives, such as multiple use, watershed management,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
or forestry programs. Five areas which fell in between these categories need further investigation.&#13;
Based on this analysis, 16 areas or clusters of areas were identified that could constitute the core&#13;
management units of largely pristine habitat. Additionally, two caves sites were included as&#13;
natural monuments for their visitation potential and some few beach sites in the Gulf of Fonseca&#13;
to protect marine turtle nesting sites. The selected areas are listed in Table 1.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
11.   The specific objectives of the Biodiversity Conservation Sub-component are:&#13;
(a)   within the SINAPH, to focus central government's management resources on a&#13;
small number of high-priority core protected areas under management by the&#13;
national forestry agency's (AFE-COHDEFOR) protected areas department&#13;
(DAPVS);&#13;
(b)   to strengthen the DAPVS to fulfill its tasks under a tight mandate and strict&#13;
budgetary discipline and increase its ability to work with other partners including&#13;
NGOs and local government and communities;&#13;
(c)   to establish a financial management mechanism for capturing significant ecotourism&#13;
income and generating a stream of revenues by building tourism infrastructure in a&#13;
selected set of priority biodiversity areas within the SINAPH; and&#13;
(d)   to finance buffer zone activities that help sustain conservation and management in&#13;
the selected protected areas and which generate local employment and revenues&#13;
through protected areas-linked ecotourism&#13;
12.  Priority setting of SINAPH. As a basis for determining priorities, a map of Honduran&#13;
ecosystems is being elaborated with PPF and additional project funds to build on the preliminary&#13;
analysis described above and detemine "representativity" of the existing SINAPH through a gap-&#13;
analysis (i.e. identification of ecosystems under-represented or absent in the national protected&#13;
areas system). Once this map of Honduran ecosystems is completed in 1997, SAG and SERNA&#13;
would host a series of consultations to evaluate the findings and build a national consensus for a&#13;
rationalized SINAPH. This dialogue will include the municipalities within whose jurisdiction the&#13;
concemed sites are located as key stakeholders. It is not anticipated that during the life of the&#13;
project any current SINAPH areas would be de-gazetted or suffer a change in legal protection&#13;
status. Nor is this an objective of the exercise. The basic objectives are: (a) to create an&#13;
adequately defined protected area system which fully incorporates a complete representation of&#13;
biodiversity and landscape values; and (b) to promote transparent, rational decisions for the&#13;
allocation of limited resources to protected area management.&#13;

13.   Strengthening of the DAPVS and Partner Organizations. Recognizing the weakness&#13;
of the Department of Protected Areas (DAPVS), the sub-component contemplates increasing the&#13;
number of staff managing the priority areas. Projections of staff needs are based on the&#13;
understanding the NGOs currently sub-contracted for protected areas management activities&#13;
would continue at their current levels of involvement or increase the scope and number of&#13;
activities in protected areas within their areas of influence. MICOSYS software, a program&#13;
developed for protected areas management planning, was used to make preliminary estimates of&#13;
staffing and financing needs for the core protected areas. The program calculates a total need of&#13;
440 staff for the selected 16 management units. Assuming a stringent mandate, efficient input of&#13;
staff and some degree of cooperation with NGOs and sub-contracting of certain tasks, a protected&#13;
areas entity of about 400 staff could effectively manage the 16 core protected management units.&#13;
14.   During the first year of the project, equipment and staff would be increased to provide&#13;
initial strengthening of the system. In this year, the project would finance acquisition of 10&#13;
vehicles, 5 motorcycles and 10 horses; and costs of increasing DAPVS (AFE-COHDEFOR)&#13;
protected areas staff from 60 to 120. As described under the Parks Fund activity, these new staff&#13;
and equipment are expected to become self-sustaining with revenues from parks entrance fees.&#13;
Further strengthening of the DAPVS will be planned based on the capacity of partner&#13;
organizations and the park management personnel needs identified, as plans are prepared for&#13;
priority areas in this sub-component and the GEF. The project would finance new personnel for&#13;
the first two years, and by the third year, the self-financing Fund should absorb annual costs of&#13;
these expenditures.&#13;
15.   Training Activities. Another institutional strengthening activity would be training of&#13;
DAPVS staff to manage the protected areas infrastructure being created, to implement the self-&#13;
financing mechanism, and to work with visitors and local communities. Some training would also&#13;
be provided to NGOs and local communities, but apart from the 7 parks being developed under&#13;
this component, most such training would be financed through the complementary GEF project&#13;
through the UNDP training sub-component.&#13;
16.   Investments in Protected Areas. The project would create a Parks Fund based on a&#13;
self-financing mechanism. Income from entrance fees in a core set of high potential eco-tourism&#13;
protected areas would be deposited in a Parks Fund to be created under the project. The income&#13;
from the Fund would be used to finance the annual recurrent costs of operating the SINAPH, in&#13;
accordance with the annual operating plan of DAPVS. In order to establish a financial base to&#13;
generate eco-tourism revenues from park entrance fees, infrastructure and equipment would be&#13;
developed to create visitor centers of international standing in 2-4 high interest protected areas&#13;
(PAs). Infrastructure would include interpretation programs and nature trails. Financing would&#13;
also be provided to up-grade 7 existing areas with duty stations and basic administrative centers&#13;
for management staff and rangers, trails or access roads to duty stations, vehicles, motorcycles,&#13;
horses, and radios for communications to and within protected areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
17.   Self-financing Mechanism and Fund. A fund (fideicomiso) would be managed by a&#13;
commercial bank to handle entry fees and make all payments to the PAs that qualify under a pre-&#13;
established set of rules. Salaries and maintenance of equipment and infrastructure would be paid&#13;
from the fund. Assuming continuing government funding of the SINAPH at current levels, it is&#13;
expected that the fund would be self-supporting for the core areas by the third year of the&#13;
project.&#13;
LONG-TERM FINANCING OF THE PROTECTED AREAS SYSTEM&#13;
18.   The total investment needs in buildings and equipment for all 16 core management units,&#13;
as estimated by the MICOSYS program, would amount to US$6,800,000. Not all these funds&#13;
would be provided by the combined Natural Resources Management and GEF projects, as several&#13;
other donors are planning to provide significant financing for some of these core areas (GTZ for&#13;
Rio Platano and the IDB for the Bay Islands). The IDA loan (Table 3) would provide financing&#13;
for 7 protected areas, of which $2.9 million would finance infrastructure and equipment and $0.4&#13;
million would finance planning and demarcation.&#13;
19.   Demarcation of the core areas will be a costly long-term process. If done gradually, in&#13;
consultation with the local population, the process will be far less costly and achieve better&#13;
consensus. The combined Natural Resources Management and GEF projects would earmark&#13;
about $600,000 for the most urgent locations. It is assumed that other projects (GTZ, etc.)&#13;
would contribute additional funds toward the long-term goal of complete demarcation.&#13;
Preparation of protected area management plans, executed under local contracts, would cost an&#13;
estimated $650,000 for all 16 core management units. The combined Natural Resources&#13;
Management and GEF projects would earmark the funds for planning for those areas which so far&#13;
are not considered to be financed by other donors.&#13;
20.   Annual operational Costs of the 16 core management units. The MICOSYS software&#13;
has calculated the annual costs for administering and managing the 16 core management units.&#13;
The program assumes inclusion of costs for: (a) write-off and maintenance of buildings and&#13;
equipment; (b) all the staff costs; and (c) all office costs, including those of headquarters. It does&#13;
not include capital costs of investments and land. It only generates an estimate of the minimum&#13;
payments required to run the system. For the 16 core management units plus headquarters costs,&#13;
the program estimates the annual costs at about $2.6 to $3.0 million.&#13;
21.   Recurrent costs of the project. The project would finance recurrent costs until the self-&#13;
financing fund mechanism takes over in the course of the third year. The project would finance&#13;
new personnel to ensure that the management unit would grow to the required size of 400 staff.&#13;
While the project's share in wages would decrease in the third year, the fund mechanism would&#13;
start taking over until the full required strength has been reached. Equally, for operation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 8 of 11&#13;
maintenance of vehicles, the project would finance recurrent costs until the fund takes over in the&#13;
third year.&#13;
22.   Income from tourism. At present, the main tourism attractions of Honduras are scuba-&#13;
diving at the Bay Islands (25,000 foreign visitors/year), the Ruins of Copan (80,000 visitors/year)&#13;
and the beaches of Tela and La Ceiba. La Muralla attracts about 60,000 visitors per year, the&#13;
majority of whom are nationals, with a high percentage of students. All told, Honduras has about&#13;
440,000 entries per year. Tourism from North America and Europe is estimated at 120,000/year.&#13;
It is expected that if the national parks system were to offer 5 visitor centers of international&#13;
quality, 80 percent of the North American and European tourists would visit at least 1 national&#13;
park, 50 percent would visit 2 national parks and 30 percent would visit 3 national parks. At an&#13;
entry fee of $10 per area, this would generate $1,920,000 per year. Based on estimates of the&#13;
current level of visitation to various areas, national visitors would pay $ 100,000 per year if they&#13;
were to pay one dollar per entry per person.&#13;
23.   A growth of the tourism market of 7 percent per year does not seem unrealistic, given the&#13;
fact that the Bay Islands are considerably upgrading the quality of their tourism infrastructure,&#13;
Copan is about to finish a good quality visitor center, and given the construction of the visitation&#13;
infrastructure proposed under this project. This would lead to a doubling of the national parks&#13;
income in 10 years, an important ingredient in the recipe for self sufficiency.&#13;
24.   Self sufficiency for the 16 core management units. In 1995, GOH financing of&#13;
protected areas was at a level of about $600.000, not including about $200,000 for staff costs and&#13;
office costs. If all the entry fees are administered through the fund to be redistributed among the&#13;
16 selected management units, this would generate about $2.0 million per year. If the GOH&#13;
continued to pay $0.8 million per year into the fund, the total annual budget for administration&#13;
and management would allow for $2.8 million for the 16 selected management units and the&#13;
headquarters. Assuming a stringent mandate and a balanced budget discipline, the system could&#13;
be effectively self-sufficient.3&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
25.   The Department of Protected Areas and Wildlife (DAPVS) of the state forestry agency&#13;
(AFE-COHDEFOR) would be responsible for the implementation of the sub-component.&#13;
26.   GEF Biodiversity Conservation Project. The GEF Biodiversity Conservation Project,&#13;
currently under formulation, is expected to be fully integrated with the Biodiversity Conservation&#13;
sub-component under the IDA loan. Major components would include: (a) institutional&#13;
3 Administering all entry fees under one fund does not necessarily imply that all revenues must go into the fund&#13;
itself. As an incentive to provide quality service and active fee collection, the feasibility of allowing a percentage&#13;
of the collected fees to be left in the area would be explored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 9 of 11&#13;
strengthening; (b) financing for infrastructure and elaboration of management plans for priority&#13;
protected areas in the Meso-American Biological Corridor, including one visitor center; (c) buffer&#13;
zone investments; and (d) monitoring.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
27.   The first year of the project would be devoted to developing an agreed structure and&#13;
working procedures for the Parks Funds and contracting the design of the infrastructure for the&#13;
protected areas included in the sub-component. During the second year, the project would enter&#13;
its construction phase. It would finance the construction of 20 ranger stations, 3 visitor centers,&#13;
trails, the production of all visitor center and interpretation trail exhibition material, as one or two&#13;
turn-key contracts. Furthermore, it would finance 5 vehicles, 10 motor cycles 15 horses and the&#13;
communication equipment and building inventories for the buildings to be constructed. Another&#13;
master plan would be developed and demarcation would take place in critical areas. The staff&#13;
would be raised with another 60 persons and a training component would be financed. The fund&#13;
would finance the management fee of the fund and recurrent costs for vehicle maintenance.&#13;
28.  The third year would mark the beginning of the self-financing phase. It would be the first&#13;
year of operation of the visitor centers. The self-financing fund would start receiving revenues&#13;
from entry fees. The project would finance the construction of 10 ranger stations, trails, the&#13;
acquisition 5 motorcycles and of the communication equipment and building inventories for the&#13;
ranger stations to be built and the demarcation of critical zones. The project would still finance a&#13;
good share of the personnel costs, but during this year the fund would start contributing as well.&#13;
In the fourth year the project would continue to finance training, and some contribution to staff&#13;
costs, but the major share would come from the fund. The project would finance 5 motorcycles&#13;
and the construction of trails. The fifth year would see the consolidation of the new&#13;
administration. The project would still finance training, the construction of some trails and the&#13;
purchase of 5 motorcycles.&#13;
BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
29.   The benefits of concentrating available resources on a core conservation system are:&#13;
(a)   The project would open up the most attractive national parks of the country to the&#13;
people of Honduras, who could then visit them at a very low cost. Those parks&#13;
would stimulate visitation by students from elementary schools, high schools, and&#13;
universities and generate a demand for biodiversity conservation.&#13;
(b)   Near the parks with visitor centers, tourism activities would gradually generate&#13;
new employment opportunities for local populations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 10 of 11&#13;
(c)   Adding quality tourism destinations to the country would benefit the entire tourism&#13;
sector, thus contributing to the growth of an economic activity with high labor&#13;
demand.&#13;
(d)   In combination with the associated GEF project, the investments would provide&#13;
major benefits to the inhabitants of buffer zone areas and the biological corridor,&#13;
including indigenous peoples.&#13;
(e)   The investment would help put a viable protected areas service into place, largely&#13;
supported through a self-financing mechanism.&#13;
30.   The risks of concentrating available resources on a core conservation system are:&#13;
(a)   Too broad a mandate being thrust upon the protected areas unit (which would&#13;
include buffer zone management activities) may lead to budgetary problems and to&#13;
inadequate management and control in the core areas. Degradation as a result of&#13;
poor visitor management, fire management, and increasing deforestation of the&#13;
core areas could result. The management of this risk would include using the&#13;
Upland Producer's Fund mechanism of the project for buffer zone activity&#13;
promotion of strategic alliances with NGOs, municipal governments and other&#13;
local interest groups for activities which do not fall directly under the competency&#13;
of the protected areas unit.&#13;
(b)   The income generated by a restricted number of highly attractive national parks&#13;
would have to be redistributed in accordance with biodiversity protection needs as&#13;
well as visitor management needs, taking into account the needs of the core&#13;
conservation system as a whole. If this were not done consistently, only the&#13;
visitation hot-spots will receive adequate financing, while areas of high biodiversity&#13;
but limited or no visitor potential (such as Rio Platano) may be left under-financed&#13;
and poorly protected. This risk would be managed through creation of a funding&#13;
mechanism independent of the government and capable of capturing financial&#13;
resources from other sources (e.g. bi-lateral assistance).&#13;
(c)   Additional visitor infrastructure beyond the 5 visitor centers would raise&#13;
management costs, but not the total number of visitors to national parks, thus&#13;
jeopardizing the self-sufficiency strategy. No additional visitor center should be&#13;
added until the total system has reached a visitation level of 400,000 entries by&#13;
foreign visitors, after which each additional 100,000 foreign visitors would allow&#13;
for, but certainly not require, the construction of an additional visitor center. The&#13;
addition of any visitor center would thus need to be based on a cost-benefit&#13;
analysis, to ensure maximum returns for the benefit of the core conservation&#13;
system.&#13;

Annex E&#13;

(d)   If the tourism and park visitation projections are not met, the system would not&#13;
become self-sufficient over time. Nevertheless, only a very pessimistic scenario&#13;
would create a situation worse than that which currently prevails. Were&#13;
visitations 50 percent lower than projected, the generated income plus the&#13;
continuation of the current government budget would still be enough to pay for the&#13;
personnel costs and running expenses (fuel and maintenance for vehicles) during&#13;
the project life.&#13;

HONDURAS&#13;
RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING, REPORTING AND EVALUATION&#13;
1. MONITORING&#13;
1.    The establishment of an efficient project monitoring system is instrumental to assure the&#13;
consistency of project activities. A set of monitoring indicators, based on the project's logical&#13;
framework analysis, is shown in Table A. The project's monitoring system will be elaborated&#13;
separately for the land administration component, the upland fund subcomponent, and the forest&#13;
management and biodiversity subcomponents. The first two components will be focused on the&#13;
PCU in the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) and the last two components will be&#13;
focused on AFE-COHDEFOR. The project monitoring system will be based on a Management&#13;
Information System (MIS) with database which organizes pertinent physical and financial&#13;
information.&#13;
A. LAND ADMINISTRATION COMPONENT&#13;
2.    This component involves coordination of actions among a number of participating&#13;
institutions at federal and field operations level. A detailed schedule of activities, costs, and&#13;
timetable have been developed in Project Management software in close collaboration with all the&#13;
implementing institutions. This schedule will provide the basis for monitoring financial flows.&#13;
The MIS will provide information regarding the progress in the pilot and subsequent expansion&#13;
sites, and financial parameters will be adjusted for the expansion phase, based on the experience&#13;
gained in the implementation of the pilot phase. Each territorial area for which information is&#13;
being acquired and registered will be treated as a subproject. Approval of initiating activities in&#13;
each area will be determined on the basis of compliance with minimum criteria for implementation&#13;
(formation of territorial commissions, signing agreements with the municipality and other&#13;
agencies, recruiting an implementing field team, training relevant staff and consultants in&#13;
procedures, and initiating promotional activities). A decentralized database will be developed, so&#13;
that field implementing units have access to needed information and can generate information to&#13;
be aggregated by the PCU.&#13;
B. UPLAND FUND SUBCOMPONENT&#13;
3.    This subcomponent involves setting up of an independent financial and approval&#13;
mechanism for selecting and funding technical assistance and research projects in the upland areas&#13;
of the project, and possibly the buffer zones areas of the complementary GEF project under&#13;
preparation. Monitoring of the overall setup and management of the fund will be carried out&#13;
under the IDB-assisted Agricultural Technology Project. The PCU will have access to this&#13;
monitoring database and will develop a register of selected projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
C. FOREST MANAGEMENT AND BIODIVERSITY SUBCOMPONENTS&#13;
4.    These subcomponents would both be implemented by AFE-COHDEFOR through the&#13;
normal operating procedures of this institution. AFE-COHDEFOR would monitor activities&#13;
through a database maintained in its administrative offices, based on an MIS system that will be&#13;
developed in the initial implementation of the project by the same consulting team developing the&#13;
MIS for the other components. The MIS system would be linked to the monitoring information&#13;
base in AFE-COHDEFOR and the Department of Protected Areas (DAPVS), that will also be in&#13;
charge of monitoring activities in the proposed GEF Biodiversity Project.&#13;
5.    Technical assistance in monitoring and evaluation would be provided to all the monitoring&#13;
agencies during the first year of the Project. While some working experience exists in these areas,&#13;
it is essential for a period of time that the units responsible for planning, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation receive assistance from a qualified consultant, in order to assist in the design and&#13;
operation of the system. TORs for such a consultant are included in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan.&#13;
2. REPORTING&#13;
6.    To the extent possible, reporting procedures within each component would follow existing&#13;
institutional reporting systems, in order to avoid duplication of effort. The complete project&#13;
reporting system would produce different types of reports, depending on the user level involved.&#13;
The PCU would compile monitoring reports and a single report will be received on the progress&#13;
with the two main components and their subcomponents.&#13;
7.    The PCU will prepare and submit quarterly reports to IDA (March 31, June 3 0,&#13;
September 30, and December 31). The quarterly reports would contain the current update of the&#13;
MIS, with all data provided in a compatible data format. The PCU and AFE-COHDEFOR&#13;
administrative offices as a minimum would acquire an internet connection to allow easy transfer of&#13;
reporting information to the IDA Task Team supervising the project. In addition, for the Upland&#13;
Funds subcomponent, monthly reports would be prepared by the PCU on the status of the&#13;
proposals selected in the Upland Fund register. The private financial institution managing the&#13;
Upland funds would maintain financial monitoring of the status of payments of selected projects.&#13;
8.    Quarterly reports would contain information on (a) status of project implementation;&#13;
(b) identification of problems and recommended solutions; (c) progress on monitorable indicators;&#13;
and (d) status of legal covenants. For the final year's report, in addition to the above information,&#13;
the PCU will provide a complete picture of the project's development over the year. The June 30&#13;
report of each year would serve as a point of discussion of the planned activities for the next&#13;
year's annual workprogram (POA), since a draft of the POAs will need to be submitted to the&#13;
Finance Ministry before September 30 of a given year. Tables of indicators would be designed to&#13;
facilitate comparison of the current year's data with that of previous years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;

9.    Auditing would be contracted by the PCU for all components. This would be in addition&#13;
to the regular audit requirements of the various agencies receiving funds directly from the national&#13;
budget as part of the counterpart funding. A multi-year audit contract would be sought with&#13;
consultants. The Government would hire independent auditing services satisfactory to IDA to&#13;
prepare annual audits at the end of each Honduran fiscal year, starting January 1996. The audit&#13;
reports would include separate opinions on the use of SOEs and the special account. The PCU&#13;
would submit the audit reports to IDA within six months of the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
International consultants would conduct technical audits of the land administration and natural&#13;
resources component at the end of year 2 and year 4. These would be critical given the newness&#13;
of the folio real approach in Honduras and the lack of experience in AFE-COHDEFOR with&#13;
decentralized procedures&#13;
3. EVALUATION&#13;
10.   The project would develop and implement a range of evaluation studies to measure the&#13;
impact of the subcomponent investments and to provide appropriate feedback to improve project&#13;
methodology and implementation. In addition, a pilot evaluation will be carried out in Year 2 of&#13;
the first phase of activities in the forest management sub-component and of the pilot phase&#13;
activities in the land administration component. A joint action plan will be prepared by GOH and&#13;
IDA identifying the critical actions which need to be implemented prior to execution of the&#13;
expansion phases of the land administration component and the forest management&#13;
subcomponent. These reviews will also evaluate progress in the Upland Fund and identify critical&#13;
actions, if deemed necessary, for further implementation of activities in this sub-component. The&#13;
PCU would be in charge of drafting Terms of Reference (TORs) in consultation with IDA and for&#13;
contracting the consulting services for the following:&#13;

RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    The economic analysis of the proposed project has focused only on the economic&#13;
impact of the productive activities under the Natural Resource Management Component,&#13;
representing about 50 percent of project investment costs, for which reasonable benefit&#13;
calculations can be made. The other components Oand administration, increasing&#13;
government and community knowledge on soil and forest management, institution building&#13;
etc.) are regarded as necessary pre-conditions for avoiding undesirable social, economic&#13;
and environmental costs. The expected benefits of enhancing the legal security of&#13;
landholders, for example, would derive from: (a) resolving long-standing tenure conflicts&#13;
which have denied government and private landholders the ability to manage forests for&#13;
their own benefits; (b) creating a more transparent and efficient land market; and (c)&#13;
providing a mechanism to preserve the value of future investments in the cadastral and&#13;
land adjudication processes. The impact of increasing government and community&#13;
knowledge on managing forests and soils would be to increase responsibility of&#13;
government and communities for the management of their natural resources and enable&#13;
them to make more efficient choices in land management and better implement their&#13;
management activities.&#13;
2.    Land Administration Modernization. This component does not lend itself to a&#13;
cost/benefit analysis, since many of the benefits cannot be meaningfully quantified.&#13;
Benefits include: (a) fulfillment of the basic purpose of the registry (i.e. provision of legal&#13;
security to landholders); (b) transparency in land markets; (c) provision of the basic inputs&#13;
required by municipalities to carry out town planning and implement fiscal policy;&#13;
(d) contribution to government and local efforts to control access to and use of public&#13;
forest areas; (e) physical security for the Public Registry (PR) data base; and (f) an&#13;
improved service to the public, including a potential for remote access. There is some&#13;
relevant research on Honduras that calculates the potential returns from (a) and (b) (i.e.&#13;
providing commercial lenders with the security necessary to provide credit to landholders&#13;
engaged in market agriculture or forestry). A recent University of Maryland study&#13;
rigorously compared a small sample of Honduran land reform beneficiaries with and&#13;
without legal title and concluded that the titled group achieved on average a 5 percent&#13;
increase in income (IRR 2 17 percent) attributable to holding legal title.&#13;
3.    A least-cost analysis was carried out during project design to evaluate the financial&#13;
costs of implementation alternatives. The resulting cost (approximately US$2.85/ha for&#13;
institutional development and completing the legal land information base for 37 percent of&#13;
Honduras' land area, including over 50 percent of the country's production forests) is&#13;
extremely low. This is possible because Honduras has significant experience through its&#13;
twenty-year land titling program and is relatively better off within the region in terms of&#13;
the existing information and data infrastructure. An additional analysis of the potential for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex Hl&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
financial sustainability of the modernized registry system to be put in place by the project&#13;
was carried out (see project file: Korczowski, 1996. Sistema del Folio Real Nacional y&#13;
SostenibilidadFinanciera), drawing upon the experience elsewhere in Latin America.&#13;
4.    Natural Resource Management (NRM). Honduras' forests are one of its most&#13;
valuable economic assets. The forest management activities proposed in the project would&#13;
lead to improved management of the forests (national, ejido and private) and, in particular,&#13;
the pine forests. The current status of these forests varies greatly, but in almost all cases it&#13;
can be improved through the application of simple forest management techniques. These&#13;
forests, without management, are estimated to produce between 2 and 4 m3 of commercial&#13;
wood per hectare per year. With a minimum of management and silvicultural treatments,&#13;
this could easily be doubled to between 4 and 8 m3/ha/yr. A recent discussion paper&#13;
(Agricultural Development Program of Honduras, 1996) implies the potential for a ten- to&#13;
eighteen-fold increase over 1994 state revenues from stumpage charges in national forests&#13;
dedicated to timber production -- from US$4.8 million (current dollars) to US$47 to&#13;
US$87 million. Additionally, annual export earnings from well-managed industrial forests&#13;
have the long-term potential to reach US$200 to US$400 million. Export earnings from&#13;
1990 to 1994 totaled U$103.6 million.&#13;
5.    For the purpose of estimating economic benefits to the forest management&#13;
activities, several representative forestry and farm models were developed The present&#13;
and projected values for the main economic variables were considered, using market prices&#13;
for the financial analysis and economic prices for the estimation of overall impact. For the&#13;
latter, a standard conversion factor of 0.85 was considered and a conversion factor of 0.7&#13;
was used to obtain an approximation of the opportunity cost of labor. Forest management&#13;
costs include forest inventory, demarcation of parcels, road network design, environmental&#13;
and social assessments and operational planning and supervision. The models developed&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   One hectare models: (i) a 20-year-old, well-stocked stand of Pinus&#13;
Caribea, with reasonable access harvested at age 40; (ii) a moderately&#13;
accessible 65-year-old, poorly-stocked stand to be converted in year 1,&#13;
naturally regenerated and harvested in year 42; and (iii) a 65-year-old, well-&#13;
stocked stand with reasonable access, to be converted in year 1, naturally&#13;
regenerated and harvested in year 42.&#13;
(b)   A project model for the entire 545,000 hectares project area, of which 53&#13;
percent is production forest. The model compares the with-project&#13;
scenario with three possible without-project scenarios: (i) a "low" scenario&#13;
-- expansion of forest management activities on national lands marginally&#13;
increases over the current pace (1994-96); (ii) a "medium" scenario -- a 50&#13;
percent increase in the rate of expansion of forest management activities,&#13;
with attention and priority placed on commercial management of well-&#13;
stocked pine forests with minimal attention to other forest areas; and (iii) a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex Hl&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
"high" scenario, similar to "medium" except that a more balanced focus&#13;
(industrial, rehabilitation, conservation) is given to forest management.&#13;
6.    In all cases, extremely conservative increases in productivity were assumed to&#13;
result from management activities. As noted above, management inputs could be expected&#13;
to double forest productivity. In this case, for the one-hectare models, productivity&#13;
increases of around 33 percent were assumed. For the 20-year project model, overall&#13;
productivity increases of 13 percent, 7 percent and 4 percent were assumed with project&#13;
against without-project low, medium, and high scenarios, respectively. These estimates&#13;
were based on the assumption that productivity gains only accrue from treatment of stands&#13;
less than 25 years of age. While the operations are both financially and economically viable&#13;
-- in all cases because there exists standing timber which can be profitably exploited with&#13;
relatively low per unit investments -- the absolute retums to improved management are&#13;
quite marginal and sensitive to management costs. Project work would include the&#13;
expansion and strengthening of the current forestry information system and treatment&#13;
impact monitoring to assist in future decision making using sounder economic criteria.&#13;

7.    The project model (Table 2 below) operates over 20 years (1997 to 2016).&#13;
Extremely conservative assumptions were made regarding timber yields, timber prices and&#13;
impacts of silvicultural treatments on productivity. Productivity increases were assumed&#13;
to result from improved forest protection, reduced deforestation/degradation and forest&#13;
fire, in addition to silvicultural treatments. Initial merchantable volumes were assumed to&#13;
be 80 and 30 m3/ha for well- and poorly-stocked stands, respectively. No harvesting was&#13;
assumed for any stand less than 40 years of age. Stumpage values of US$23 and US$11&#13;
per cubic meter were assigned to well-stocked and poorly-stocked stands, respectively,&#13;
under the assumption that the lower volume stands would have higher costs associated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H1&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
their harvests. Rates of harvest were constrained to reflect management objectives of&#13;
bringing all production forest into a 40-year rotation schedule with even-age management&#13;
in individual management compartments. The rate of conversion from present age&#13;
structure to a regular rotation was 65 years, based on a parallel objective to maintain&#13;
regular harvests during the conversion period while maintaining the presence of&#13;
mature/over-mature stands (for habitat purposes) during the first 40 years. A 10 percent&#13;
unit increase was assumed in costs for the "low" scenario to adjust overhead upward to&#13;
reflect current (estimated) overheads in national forest and to create a penalty for lack of&#13;
investment in training, information systems, etc. No "institutional efficiency penalties"&#13;
were assessed in the "medium" and "high" scenario models only to avoid overly-biasing&#13;
the outcomes. In reality, there would undoubtedly be some costs associated with these&#13;
scenarios' significantly lower investments in training of personnel.&#13;
8.    As with the one-hectare forestry models, the results indicate that the presence of&#13;
immediately exploitable forests ensures that even marginally efficient operations can be&#13;
both financially and economically attractive. A sensitivity analysis showed that results&#13;
were very robust. Costs increases and stumpage value decreases in the order of 50&#13;
percent were required to undermine the viability of all of the scenarios.&#13;

9.    For purposes of comparing incremental project costs and benefits, the "medium"f&#13;
scenario was chosen as the most likely outcome for the without-project comparator. The&#13;
medium scenario assumes that the major focus would be on timber extraction from&#13;
existing well-stocked forests with the minimum investment in overall forest management.&#13;
Based on this comparison, the present value (10 percent discount rate)of the sub-&#13;
component's incremental benefits are US$17.6 million based on an incremental timber&#13;
production of 3.2 million cubic meters. The IRR is greater than 50 percent.&#13;

10.   Fund for Upland Producers. This sub-component would provide technical&#13;
assistance and training to 6,500 poor rural households for natural forest management,&#13;
hilislope agriculture, and livestock. Actual activities under the project would vary&#13;
considerably depending on community demands, the location and quality of the producer's&#13;
land and the technical skills and initiative of that producer. A set of representative&#13;
household models of the types of activities proposed, with estimated costs and returns&#13;
over time, were prepared to determine financial and economic viability. The focus of the&#13;
agricultural models were basic grains (corn, beans, and rice), but supplemental financial&#13;
models for livestock (meat and milk) were also developed. A review of a series of case&#13;
studies from Honduras provided the basis for estimations.&#13;
11.   A global analysis of the impact of the upland fund was also carried out, based on&#13;
basic grain crops and forestry. The main expected interventions from the fund would be:&#13;
(a)   agriculture - increased planting density (corn crops), halting burning of&#13;
fields, contour cultivation, crop residue management, "green mulch" and&#13;
contour vegetative barriers of vetiver;&#13;
(b)   forestry - silvicultural treatments (thinning, assisted natural regeneration),&#13;
pine forest management/harvesting, and forest protection (fire,&#13;
encroachment).&#13;
12.   Calculated benefits do not include potential off-site impacts of reduced soil erosion&#13;
and run-off. The primary incentives for adoption would be on-site benefits (i.e. increased&#13;
and more stable yields, lower inputs). Yield increases assumed were conservative (50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex Hi&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
percent) relative to yield increases reported in case studies (100 percent - 200 percent) and&#13;
well within the technically feasible potential. Economic prices were based on commodity&#13;
prices (1994/96) reported by the United States Department of Agriculture, Foreign&#13;
Agricultural Services, for sales of US grains in Mexico and Central America and local&#13;
market prices. Over 20 years it was assumed that an average of 2.5 other households&#13;
would adopt the agricultural technologies extended, increasing the economic benefits&#13;
across an additional 10,000 households. For forestry, the same forest structure, yield&#13;
impacts and incremental production were assumed as in the national forest models.&#13;
Estimates of deforestation were developed based on national level data, and the assumed&#13;
"with project" 60 percent reduction is based on Honduras CIDA project data. A recent&#13;
project review found reductions in deforestation rates of 85 to 90 percent resulting from&#13;
the provision of forest usufruct instruments and extension services to community groups.&#13;
13.   Based on the crop activity models, three farm models were tested. All of the&#13;
models were financially viable, suggesting that beneficiaries are likely to be interested in&#13;
the adoption of the improved farming measures. The three models are:&#13;
(a)   Subsistence farm - 1.05 ha with beans and corn. NPV (10 percent) =&#13;
$1,197; IRR &gt; 50 percent.&#13;
(b)   Subsistence farm with livestock - 1.05 ha farm with 1 dual purpose cow.&#13;
NPV (10 percent) = $1,507; IRR &gt; 50 percent.&#13;
(c)   Subsistence farm with rice - 1.17 ha farm with .12 ha of rice. NPV (10&#13;
percent) = $1,362: IR &gt; 50 percent.&#13;
Assuming that the project subsidizes extension and the initial germplasm introductions&#13;
(i.e., for cover crops and vegetative barriers) and that adoption of technologies across the&#13;
farm are phased in over 4 years (i.e., the farmers experiment with and adopt the&#13;
technologies at their own pace), there is no decline in family income in the first years of&#13;
adoption.&#13;

14.   Biodiversity Protection. The protection of Honduras's national parks and&#13;
reserves is essential to: (a) reduce or eliminate encroachment of agricultural activities and&#13;
impacts from fire and other activities; (b) increase visitation, particularly by eco-tourists in&#13;
order to increase foreign exchange income; and (c) improve the protection of the nation's&#13;
ecology and biodiversity. It is not possible, with the information currently available in&#13;
Honduras, to estimate the expected increases in direct income to the protected area system&#13;
through, say, construction and operation of modem visitors' centers and improved road&#13;
access to the areas; nor the potential increases in tourist income from persons visiting the&#13;
country entirely or partially because of the improvements in the protected areas system. It&#13;
is clear, however, from the example of neighboring Costa Rica, and the possible spill-over&#13;
from joint (e.g., Central American) ecotourism efforts, that these benefits could be&#13;
substantial.&#13;
15.   Estimates generated during project design suggest that with current practices and&#13;
the state maintaining its traditional role, investments of about US$10 million would be&#13;
required in equipment and infrastructure, with recurrent annual costs of about US$5&#13;
million, to operate the system in an adequate fashion. Project interventions are expected&#13;
to assist in lowering the state's costs by assisting in rationalizing priorities and roles of&#13;
government (national and local), communities, private sector and NGOs in protected area&#13;
management. Preliminary estimates show the potential to reduce state recurrent costs to&#13;
around US$2.5 to US$3.0 million per year while generating income through tourism of&#13;
between US$1 and US$1.9 million per year.&#13;
16.   Conclusion. As summarized in Table 5 below, 50 percent of project investment&#13;
ftunds going to directly productive investments would produce measurable economic&#13;
returns necessary to justify almost 75 percent of the total proposed project costs. The&#13;
project as designed is a coherent whole, however, and would result in substantial longer-&#13;
term benefits in land tenure and social well-being that have not been factored into the&#13;
economic evaluation.&#13;

RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT PLAN&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The proposed project is a pilot which would provide financing to: (a) modernize&#13;
the system of rural land titling and rural land registration; (b) strengthen Government's&#13;
forest administration agency, the Administraci6n Forestal del Estado-Corporaci6n&#13;
Hondurenla de Desarrollo Forestal (AFE), while incorporating surrounding populations in&#13;
forest and protected areas management and wise use; (c) establish a decentralized fund for&#13;
support to upland producers for agricultural, livestock and forest technology generation&#13;
and transfer; and (d) assist in prioritization of protected areas and protected area's&#13;
investments, providing infrastructure and participatory management for some key parks&#13;
and reserves, while promoting self-financing of the system. Among the project's central&#13;
goals is to increase the participation of municipalities, communities, and small farmers,&#13;
extending successful pilot experiences with locally financed and managed programs to&#13;
Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) agencies. The project has been assigned to&#13;
Environmental Assessment Category B.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.    The overall objective of the project is to increase the productivity and&#13;
environmental value of the forest and agricultural resource base. The project continues&#13;
support of the natural resource management and land administration activities initiated in&#13;
the AGSAC, and expands its support to include modernization of the land registry system,&#13;
improve forest management, and technology generation and transfer to upland farmers&#13;
through actions in priority areas.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3 .    The project would have two complementary components:&#13;
4.    Land Administration - under this component the project would finance&#13;
equipment for mapping, surveying, and management information systems, staff and&#13;
operating costs; consultant services; technical assistance and training for:&#13;
(a)   pilot implementation of a modern land registry system at municipal level&#13;
based on a folio real;&#13;
(b)   cadastral activities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H2&#13;
Page 2 of 27&#13;
(c)   land adjudication and titling in priority natural resource management areas;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)   support for conflict resolution.&#13;
5.    These four subcomponents aim to gradually transform the traditional, personal&#13;
registry system to a parcel-based system, while supporting cadastral and titling activities&#13;
in priority areas through the National Agrarian Institute (INA) and the national cadastre&#13;
(DEC). The component would also support the delimitation and rationalization of land&#13;
and forest rights on public and community lands within the project areas. Particular&#13;
support would be given to the regularization of three type of farmers: small-scale farmers&#13;
without title who settled on national lands before the passage of the AML in 1992;&#13;
indigenous peoples; and groups of farmers interested in social forestry and conservation&#13;
activities on public forest lands in their vicinity. A pilot land registry modernization&#13;
program would be undertaken in 16 municipalities of the department of Comayagua to&#13;
test the methodology and institutional working arrangements.&#13;
6.    Natural Resource Management - under this component the project would&#13;
finance staff and operating costs; consultant services; equipment for computers, mapping,&#13;
and survey activities; vehicles; technical assistance and training, and infrastructure for:&#13;
(a)   Forest management.  Integrated forest management planning and plan&#13;
implementation in eleven public forest management units (unidades de&#13;
gesti6n) in three administrative forest regions, totaling about 5,450 kmi,&#13;
and institutional strengthening including:&#13;
(i)   forest land tenure - establishing a database/registry of public forest&#13;
lands; delimiting and marking public forest boundaries; carrying out&#13;
a census of occupants of public forest lands along with diagnostics&#13;
and analyses of traditional rights and uses of public forest lands by&#13;
occupants; initiating the process of formalizing traditional rights&#13;
and uses of occupants of public forest lands; and entering into legal&#13;
agreements (contratos de usufructo) with communities and groups&#13;
over their participation in the responsibilities and benefits of forest&#13;
management;&#13;
(ii)   public forest management - carrying out three regional, forest&#13;
sector environmental assessments; developing or revising eleven&#13;
forest management master plans; formalizing the master plans&#13;
through a process of public consultation; inventorying 298,500&#13;
hectares of forest; developing detailed management plans for&#13;
146,500 hectares of pine production forest; formalizing the detailed&#13;
management plans through a process of environmental assessment&#13;
and consultation with affected groups; implementation of&#13;
management in 146,500 hectares of pine production forest plans&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

545,000 hectares of forest; rehabilitating 45 km of forest roads and;&#13;
developing and implementing 6 Protected Area plans in locally&#13;
important protected areas not covered by the Biodiversity&#13;
component;&#13;
(iii)  forest regulation and control - decentralizing administrative,&#13;
budgetary and monitoring functions for forest management to the&#13;
regional levels; assisting to improve agility and coverage of the&#13;
Department of Norms and Control as the entity responsible for&#13;
technical and environmental standards and compliance. See Box 1;&#13;
(iv)   applied forestry research - strengthening of AFE's permanent&#13;
sample plot program for monitoring distribution, growth, and&#13;
regenerative capacity of the commercial forest; and&#13;
(v)   institutional strengthening of AFE-COHDEFOR - providing&#13;
support to national and field level offices, upgrading of professional&#13;
skills of staff, improving systems of forest information and&#13;
monitoring, and technical assistance in developing new, more&#13;
detailed operational standards and guidelines for forest technical&#13;
and environmental aspects of forest management and regulations,&#13;
through logistic support (vehicles, office and field equipment,&#13;
rehabilitation of forest management unit offices, operational&#13;
expenses), training (in key areas for forest management and&#13;
administration), information systems (in order to systematize,&#13;
organize, provide access to biophysical and forestry sector&#13;
information necessary for planning and monitoring of forest&#13;
resources) and, technical assistance (in support of implementation&#13;
activities associated with forest land tenure, environmental&#13;
assessment, institutional decentralization and administration,&#13;
information systems, training, forest management, forestry research,&#13;
promotion and extension, forest regulatory policy, community&#13;
participation and public consultation, and legal advice).&#13;
(b)   Upland Producers Fund.  To finance proposals from producer&#13;
organizations, NGOs, and municipal governments including staff and&#13;
operating costs, consultant services, research, technical assistance, and&#13;
training for the generation and transfer of agriculture, livestock, and forest&#13;
technologies appropriate to upland areas. The Fund would provide a grant&#13;
window, independent of SAG, for channeling research and extension&#13;
activities to upland farmers and forest producers which include:&#13;

Guard system; delimitation of protected areas; infrastructure&#13;
development; management planning; and support to community&#13;
activities in buffer zones (to be financed by GEF through the&#13;
Upland Producers' Fund) which are compatible with biodiversity&#13;
conservation objectives.&#13;
(ii)   studies - of the traditional land uses within the protected areas and&#13;
the biodiversity values.&#13;
(iii)  development of mechanisms for self-financing - for the&#13;
protected areas system, and consultation on these mechanisms with&#13;
the National Committee on Biodiversity, the Natural Resources&#13;
and Environment Secretariat (SERNA), SAG, NGOs, and the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
(iv)   development of an improved biodiversity information base - as&#13;
part of the geographic information system being developed for use&#13;
by AFE as a tool of national resource management.&#13;

7.    Natural resource management activities would be concentrated on important&#13;
forested areas in the Departments of Yoro, Olancho, Francisco Morazan and a small&#13;
portion of Atlantida (Olanchito, located administratively in the Yoro region), including the&#13;
adjacent uplands and priority watersheds, and additional areas of key biodiversity as&#13;
included under the Biodiversity Conservation subcomponent (to be determined). Land&#13;
administration modernization would be initiated in the Department of Comayagua, and&#13;
later extended to Cortes, San Francisco Morazan, Olancho, and Yoro.&#13;

8.    The project area is characterized by climates ranging from sub-humid sub-tropical&#13;
(.-1,000 mm rain yr- ) to per-humid tropical (&gt;&gt;1,600mm yf 1) and mean annual&#13;
temperatures ranging from 160 (montane zones) to 240 C (lowlands). The principal&#13;
general soil groupings in the area include the udults, udalfs, and tropaquepts; the&#13;
predominate parent materials are limestones and metamorphic rocks of diverse&#13;
composition. In the specific project areas, all lands are classified (at 1:250,000) as Land&#13;
Use Capability Class IV (very severe limitations for cultivation requiring careful selection&#13;
of crop plants and application of soil conservation and management) and classes V&#13;
(unsuited to cultivation, suitable for improved pasture) to VII (unsuited to cultivation, use&#13;
restricted to range, wildlife or forest); though such classification should be taken as&#13;
indicative only given both the scale and the classification's being primarily developed for&#13;
temperate, mechanized agriculture. Pine forests predominate and the project units&#13;
comprise areas which are among the major timber production zones in the country; there&#13;
are some 1.5 million hectares of production forest with an estimated standing volume of&#13;
(very loose estimate) 93.6 million m3 of timber.&#13;

9.    In biodiversity terms, the value of the project area is reflected in its quantity of&#13;
protected areas (17 area, both declared and proposed). While "quantities of protected&#13;
areas" is obviously a rather poor proxy for defining biodiversity values, in fact there is&#13;
surprisingly little information on the genetic and species resources of the area. Within the&#13;
more than 5,000km2 of existing and proposed protected areas within the project area, the&#13;
most important from a national perspective are those in the Departments of Olancho and&#13;
Yoro.&#13;
10.   Based on recent work carried out by World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank&#13;
(Dinerstein, et al. 1995. A Conservation Assessment of the Terrestrial Ecoregions of Latin&#13;
America and the Caribbean), the project areas coincides with the following forest types&#13;
and ecoregions of interest.&#13;

" - "Forest management units" are administrative delineations which include all lands, i.e.&#13;
they are not strictly comprised of public lands or forest lands, rather their definition&#13;
encompasses both urban and rural zones and all lands public, private, ejido and communal.&#13;
"- soil utilization" is a production-oriented concept, for purposes of environmental&#13;
analysis its utility derives from its definition of "over utilization" and "normal utilization"&#13;
as indicators of areas of degrading vs. potentially sustainable land uses and "sub&#13;
utilization" as a crude indicator of natural areas which may or may not be under&#13;
extensive uses (e.g., forest grazing, fuelwood collection, etc.).&#13;

outside of the protected areas system. The forest management units&#13;
containing such forest types are Olanchito, Culmi and Catacamas. In the&#13;
latter two, the remaining areas of these forest types are almost wholly&#13;
contained within the protected areas system (Rio Platano Biosphere&#13;
Reserve and Patuca National Park). In Olanchito, such forests exist both&#13;
within and outside the protected areas system. They are found in the&#13;
majority in public lands.&#13;
Conifer/Temperate Broadleaf Forests, Central American pine-oak forests - these&#13;
forests are considered vulnerable, bioregionally outstanding, and of moderate priority for&#13;
conservation at the regional-scale. These forest types are found within almost all of the&#13;
project's forest management units; though they represent only a small (usually less than&#13;
10%) percentage of the total forest cover-types. The extent to which these exist within&#13;
and outside of the protected area system remains to be determined when more detailed&#13;
work is carried out during the forest master planning exercises during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;

11.    The environmental and social aspects of the project were undertaken by local&#13;
consultants, an assessment of biodiversity conservation priorities (ongoing) and the status&#13;
of protected areas, and a detailed review of the environmental criteria included in forest&#13;
management plans. The natural resource management component seeks to foster&#13;
community forestry on municipal and national forest lands, and various assessments would&#13;
be made as a part of project design to determine the appropriate strategies and&#13;
institutional arrangements for community forestry activities. A full social assessment has&#13;
been completed and which included consultations with stakeholders and an evaluation of&#13;
the potential impacts on indigenous peoples; a separate Indigenous Peoples Development&#13;
Plan is not required for this project. A more complete treatment of social issues is&#13;
provided in Annex H3, SocialAssessment.&#13;
12.       The project is designed to support a program  of institutional strengthening, natural&#13;
resource management planning, and community-based/participatory natural resource&#13;
management activities. Resultingly, preparation activities are restricted to identification of&#13;
needs and opportunities and the detailing of processes and mechanisms for project&#13;
implementation. Detailed information on specific interventions and activities in forest and&#13;
upland areas is not, therefore, available for review at project appraisal. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H2&#13;
Page 10 of 27&#13;
Environmental Analysis (see Table 4) of the project, therefore, is based on: (a) the&#13;
specific types of investment activities that would be financed under the project; and&#13;
(b) identification of environmental risks associated with such activities. The&#13;
Environmental Management Plan subsequently proposes the mechanisms, activities and&#13;
financing necessary within the implementation process in order to comply with&#13;
environmental requirements of GOH and IDA.&#13;
13.   The main environmental risks associated with the project are:&#13;
(a)   Land adjudication and forest land tenure: increased and/or induced&#13;
pressures on common and open resources.&#13;
(b)   Natural resource management:&#13;
(i)    Forest road rehabilitation - increased erosion and sedimentation;&#13;
improved access facilitating encroachment and illegal harvesting of&#13;
forest products (incl. Wildlife).&#13;
(ii)   Silvicultural treatments &amp; forest harvesting - loss of biodiversity;&#13;
overharvesting; loss or degradation of wildlife habitat; water quality&#13;
impacts (turbidity, sediment, BOD, DO, temperature); genetic&#13;
erosion; alterations in catchment hydrology (increased peak flows,&#13;
reduced base flows, decreased groundwater recharge); soil&#13;
degradation (fertility loss, erosion, reduced productivity, etc.);&#13;
increased forest access (hunting, colonization, social conflicts).&#13;
(iii)   Agricultural &amp; forestry extension and technical assistance - land use&#13;
conversion; increased soil loss and degradation (physical/chemical/&#13;
biological); non-point source pollution; overgrazing; increased&#13;
pasture burning; forest conversion; water quality impacts.&#13;
(iv)   Biodiversity Conservation - shift of protected areas priorities and&#13;
protection resources decreasing protection capability in other areas;&#13;
increased or induced pressures on protected areas from enhanced&#13;
"attractiveness" of near-protected area zones as a result of&#13;
investments in community economic and quality of life investments.&#13;
14.   It should be noted that the project would not finance any logging activities per se,&#13;
it would finance activities which would lead up to commercial logging in some areas of&#13;
pine forests and community logging (small-scale, manual) in some areas of pine and&#13;
broadleaf (potentially including humid tropical moist forest). It would also finance&#13;
silvicultural activities (primarily thinnings), which in some number of cases would be&#13;
commercial thinnings.&#13;

FRAMEWORK FOR IPLEMENTATION OF THE ENVIRONNMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN&#13;
(see Table 5)&#13;
15.   Land Adjudication and Forest Land Tenure: The primary responses to the&#13;
potential for increased and/or induced pressures on common and open resources are the&#13;
project's support for activities which would clarify land occupancy and legal status in&#13;
national forest lands, assist in providing tenure security over the resource, and enhance&#13;
institutional presence and enforcernent; of national forest land boundaries.&#13;
16.   The framework for provision of enhanced tenure security resides in the&#13;
"Regularization of Forest-Occupants Rights"-initiative of GOH and the Agricultural&#13;
Sector Modernization Law of 1992. Honduran law prohibits the titling of land that is&#13;
defined as "Terreno De Vocaci6n Forestal" TVF) or Land of Forestry Vocation 2 Only&#13;
such TVF which currently is titled as "Dominio Pleno" is recognized as non-public land;&#13;
by some definitions Dominio Pleno derives only from the original Spanish Land Grants.&#13;
All other titles (Dominio Util) or claims are not recognized as valid in terms of land&#13;
ownership (though the occupant can sell the "mejoras" to the land and with it pass on their&#13;
occupancy claim to another) and for purposes of receiving a government license for&#13;
certain activities (e.g., forest harvesting). In forested areas these later constitute the vast&#13;
majority of land claims. In theory, only those with land claims prior to the passage of the&#13;
Agricultural Sector Modernization Law in 1992 are recognized as having valid claim to&#13;
regularization. The exact meaning of "regularization" is currently part of IDA's policy&#13;
dialogue with GOH. During project implementation an explicit regularization policy and&#13;
its reglamento are expected to be defined. In practice, GOH has no policy (or intention)&#13;
to resettle persons who settled in TVF after 1992. Rather the intention is that such&#13;
persons would be incorporated into the overall rights of communities in TVF and be&#13;
allowed to participate in livelihood activities as defined within GOH forest management&#13;
plans. By definition, TVF covers some 75% to 80% of the country, and almost 100% of&#13;
the project area. In what is currently considered TVF, the project would only promote&#13;
private titling in what would be the minimal number cases where closer inspection found&#13;
that the TVF classification was incorrect (current definition is on 1:100,000 and smaller&#13;
scales). Priority activities are those related to clarifying forest occupant rights (census of&#13;
occupants, diagnostics of occupant land uses and perceptions of rights, conflict resolution&#13;
mechanisms), and assisting in the development of alternative tenure instruments for&#13;
treatment of traditional rights of communities and individuals.&#13;
17.   The Department of Cadastre (DEC) would be financed to carry out parcel-level&#13;
cadastres in each of the project forest management units. This would be part of a larger&#13;
process within which DEC would complete a rural cadastre of the entire Departments of&#13;
n2 TVF is defined based on criteria, which include: i) land with slopes greater than or equal to 30%; or&#13;
ii) land below 30% slope with soils having a sandy-texture and/or a depth of less than 20 cm and/or&#13;
more than 15% (by volume) stones with the presence of rocky outcrops, and/or soils subject to&#13;
inundation by tidal fluxes, and/or with restricting layers in the subsoil or with impermeable parent&#13;
material.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Yoro, Olancho and Francisco Morazain. The project areas would be given the highest&#13;
priority in terms of where the cadastre begins. The outputs from the parcel-level surveys&#13;
would also better identify local stakeholders (and interests), among whom AFE would&#13;
promote usufruct contracts for forest management and protection. It is assumed that such&#13;
arrangements would assist in reducing pressures from migrants and agricultural&#13;
conversion. This is borne out by recent studies (1996) by CIDA within their community-&#13;
based broadleaf forest management project in Atlantida. Over a five year period forest&#13;
conversion rates were reduced by more than 75% in areas where usufruct contracts were&#13;
given.&#13;
18.   Complementing the work by DEC and AFE's granting of usufruct rights, the&#13;
Upland Producer's Fund would finance the community-level processes for establishing&#13;
legal identity and obtaining usufruct rights. In addition, more than 4% of total project&#13;
costs will go directly to forest protection activities to be carried out under forest&#13;
management plans.&#13;
Box 2. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MrrIGATION FORM (AFE-IDA)&#13;
Under current regulations, each forest management plan must include a section on potential impacts and&#13;
mnitigation measures. The inforiation required in the form is presented below. Currently, in conjunction&#13;
with SERNA (under the IDA-financed Environmental Development Project (IDA Cr. 2693-HO) and&#13;
several other donor-supported initiatives ongoing in the AFE-COHDEFOR, an enviromnental assessment&#13;
manual for forest management is being developed to replace the current form. The draft mamn  will be&#13;
available in late 1996. The manual is to address the weakaesses in the current focus of EA.&#13;
Information required:.&#13;
For the following items and specific topics an estimate of potential impacts, rated as: "Not significant",&#13;
"Small", "Large" or "Permanent/Irreversible", is to be determined in the field by the forester.conpleting&#13;
the management plan. The specific mitigatorv measures to be taken in the management plan's execution&#13;
are identified and described for each item and topic. The mitigatory measured must be integrated into the&#13;
overall plan and budget&#13;
Topography And Soil: Slope stability; Stability of road cuts; Stability of stream and gully banks; Erosion;&#13;
Sedimentation;&#13;
Hydrology: Runoff; Water quality&#13;
Climate: Micro-climate; Smoke&#13;
Vegetation: Partial Removal; Species loss; Regeneration; Logging slash; Fire; Scrub formation; Opening&#13;

19.   Natural Resource Management.    The project proposes a series of responses (see&#13;
Table 5) ranging from inputs during the forest management planning stages; investments in&#13;
institutional capacity building; investments in training, technical assistance, extension, and applied&#13;
research; monitoring and supervision inputs; and agreed financing criteria. These include:&#13;
(a)   Forest regional forestry sector environmental assessment. Under the IDA-&#13;
financed HONDURAS - Environmental Development Project (Cr. 26934HO)&#13;
SERNA and AFE would contract sectoral environmental assessments in the three&#13;
project regions. These would be carried out during the first six months of project&#13;
implementation and have the objectives of strengthening subsequent forest&#13;
management planning and implementation through providing analysis of potential&#13;
cumulative effects of forest management activities between forest management&#13;
units and establishing a broader, environmental planning framework to be&#13;
respected in the subsequent individual forest management plans developed at the&#13;
management unit-level.&#13;
(b)   Forest management planning. The project would support forest management&#13;
planning at the institutional-level (AFE) for management of public forest lands, to&#13;
municipalities for management of ejido forest lands, and to communities (including&#13;
local groups, cooperatives, etc.) for management of public (under usufruct&#13;
contracts) or communal forest lands. The management planning process and the&#13;
resulting management plans provide, in the first instance, the focus for exercising&#13;
environmental safeguards. On public forest lands, planning would be carried out in&#13;
a three-step process:&#13;
(i)   forest master planning - to develop macro-plans for each forest&#13;
management unit. The outputs from the process would include: a)&#13;
delimitation of public forest lands; b) a rapid inventory of the existing forest&#13;
resources; c) a census of forest occupants and participatory diagnostics of&#13;
their land uses; d) a sub-division of the management unit into planning&#13;
blocks based on zoning (protected areas, critical microwatersheds,&#13;
multiple-use areas, production forest, etc.) and for pine production forest a&#13;
further sub-division based on density, age, and volume; e) design of road&#13;
network; f) environmental impact assessment; g) forest protection plan; and&#13;
h) public consultations to finalize plan.&#13;
(ii)  forest management planning - to develop detailed management plans for&#13;
each of the management sub-divisions. In the case of production forest this&#13;
entails stand-level inventories, development of silvicultural treatment plans,&#13;
and of long-term harvesting and regeneration plans. In the case of critical&#13;
microwatersheds this involves promoting formal agreements between AFE&#13;
and the concerned municipality for development and implementation of a&#13;
management and protection plan (to be financed by the Upland Producer's&#13;
Fund). In the case of protected areas, the Biodiversity Conservation sub-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H2&#13;
Page 14 of 27&#13;
component would finance management planning in high, national priority&#13;
areas. In multiple-use areas, this involves promoting formal agreements&#13;
between AFE and the concerned communities or groups for planning and&#13;
management (community portion to be financed by the Upland Producer's&#13;
Fund). Required elements from the regional and master planning&#13;
environmental assessments would be incorporated into the forest&#13;
management plan, and included in an environmental control and&#13;
supervision plan section.&#13;
(iii)  annual operating plans - to develop an annual plan of work and budget&#13;
for implementation of activities called for under the management plan.&#13;
This includes activities such as a stand-level analysis to mark seed trees to&#13;
be left; plan silvicultural treatments; and complete stand maps. Required,&#13;
elements from the forest management plan's environmental control and&#13;
supervision plan would be incorporated into the annual operating plan and&#13;
budget.&#13;
On ejido and communal lands, and in the case of usufruct contracts on&#13;
public lands, the Upland Producer's Fund would finance the services of a&#13;
professional forester to assist the community in developing and executing a&#13;
forest management plan. Management planning would follow the so-called&#13;
"simplified forest planning model"; the model has been developed and&#13;
tested during the last 5 years as a part of the FlNNIDA-financed Programa&#13;
Centro Americano Forestal. The model provides a more than adequate&#13;
basis for planning forest operations on a small-scale (&lt;10,000 ha).&#13;
(c)   Institutional capacity building. The project would provide significant levels of&#13;
institutional support (&gt;10% of total project cost) to the AFE to assist it to&#13;
decentralize along forest management lines, establish an effective field presence,&#13;
upgrade the skills of its forestry professionals, have access to the information&#13;
necessary to prioritize interventions and make decisions, to integrate social and&#13;
environmental concems into management planning and implementation, and to&#13;
carry out intemal monitoring of performance and compliance.&#13;
(d)   training, technical assistance, and extension.    The Upland Producer's Fund&#13;
is designed to provide access to appropriate natural resource management&#13;
approaches and technologies for municipalities, communities, and community&#13;
groups. The operating of the Fund is also assumed to place extemal pressure on&#13;
the AFE to carry out its role of involving communities in forest management and&#13;
exercising technical and environmental oversight on public lands. The Fund also&#13;
supports training of natural resource professionals who would provide services to&#13;
municipalities and groups, a priority theme of which would be management of&#13;
environmental risks in forestry and agricultural systems. An independent private&#13;
sector firm or NGO would be contracted to administer, manage, promote, and&#13;
supervise the Upland Producer's Fund. The fund manager would be responsible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H12&#13;
Page 15 of 27&#13;
for the technical adequacy of the proposals funded and assuring the quality of their&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(d)   Monitoring and supervision inputs:&#13;
(i)    Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), located in the Ministry of Natural&#13;
Resources, would have overall responsibility for monitoring and&#13;
supervision of the project. The main instruments which they would have to&#13;
ensure project compliance with IDA and GOH environmental standards&#13;
are: a. annual technical audits - which, inter alia, would provide an&#13;
independent review the environmental aspects of project implementation;&#13;
b. project mid-term review - as a pilot project which will require close&#13;
supervision of implementation experience in order to allow appropriate&#13;
adjustments to be made during project life, two mid-term reviews would be&#13;
scheduled (and financed) within which the major focus would be on&#13;
environmental aspects of forest management planning and execution; and&#13;
c. annual implementation reports and work programs from the&#13;
implementing institutions, indicators relevant to forest protection and&#13;
management would be reported upon in the implementation reports.&#13;
(ii)   DEC would have responsibility for all elements related to the legal&#13;
definition of lands and land boundaries, both in terms of delineation of&#13;
public forest lands, as well as definition of traditional holdings within public&#13;
forest lands and their legal disposition.&#13;
(iii)   AFE's Department of Norms and Control would be charged with&#13;
ensuring the completion and quality of all environmental assessment work&#13;
and that the AFE's forest management plans complied with technical and&#13;
environmental standards 1' (see Box 3) and incorporated outputs from both&#13;
the regional and management unit-level EAs. They would also supervise&#13;
Regional offices' approvals of municipal and community-level management&#13;
plans. Where commercial logging is to carried out, the department would&#13;
have ultimate responsibility for approving release of the performance bonds&#13;
deposited by the logging outfit to ensure compliance with environmental&#13;
and technical norns. Throughout the process the Department would be&#13;
charged with coordinating with SERNA and acquiring all approvals&#13;
required by law, including assuring that required "Licencia Ambiental " are&#13;
obtained for all activities which require one.&#13;
- With the assistance of the IDA-financed Environmnental Development Project, USAID's Forestry Development&#13;
Project, the FINNTDA project, and several other forestry sector donors, the AFE is still in the process of&#13;
formalizing its operational technical and environmental norms for environment; a manual for environmental&#13;
assessment in forest management planning is also under development. Prior to negotiation of the project,&#13;
IDA would need to review the latest draft to identify any gaps or conflicts with IDA guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H2&#13;
Page 16 of 27&#13;
(iv)   AFE's Regional offices would be responsible to review the forest&#13;
management units' (unidades de gesti6n) annual operating plans to ensure&#13;
that they comply with forest management plans and technical and&#13;
environmental standards. They would be responsible to review the&#13;
municipal and community-level management plans and their&#13;
implementation. The payment of professional foresters' services by the&#13;
Upland Producer's Fund would be conditioned on the regional offices&#13;
approvals.&#13;
(v)   SERNA would be responsible for the financing, supervision and approval&#13;
of the regional forestry sector environmental assessment and the review&#13;
and In addition, they would participate with the AFE in all decisions&#13;
related to the prioritization of lands, activities and investments within the,&#13;
protected areas system. SERNA's role in the environmental review and&#13;
approval of individual forest management plans would include coordinating&#13;
with AFE's Department of Norms and Control and assuring that it&#13;
complies with all legal requirements related to environmental assessments&#13;
and approvals.&#13;
(vi)   Upland Producer's Fund Manager would be responsible for assuring&#13;
that all financed proposals (both in the planning and the implementation&#13;
stages) are in compliance with financing criteria. Financing criteria include&#13;
those related to appropriate technical content and quality, as well as&#13;
broader environmental concerns. They would also be responsible to&#13;
coordinate with the PCU and AFE to assure that financing for key activities&#13;
(e.g., establishment of legal identity and obtaining usufruct contracts,&#13;
technical services for forest management, etc.) is available in a timely&#13;
fashion in the locations required by the project.&#13;
(e)      Financing criteria. A series of financing criteria were agreed at project&#13;
negotiations both for the project as a whole, as well as for subsequent financing of&#13;
activities under the Upland Producer's Fund. Other than those agreements over&#13;
specific project activities (summarized, above, in this annex detailed in the Project&#13;
Implementation Document) and GOH's commitment to their implementation, the&#13;
main agreements reached include:&#13;
(i)    Project wide:&#13;
a.    completion of sectoral forestry environmental assessments to&#13;
identify sensitive areas and environmental assessments completed&#13;
for all forest management plans prior to financing of management&#13;
activities;&#13;
b.    annual technical audits and mid-term review;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

c.    no financing of new roads, rehabilitation only of existing;&#13;
d.    no financing of commercial logging or logging equipment in&#13;
primary tropical moist forest;&#13;
e.    no financing of activities within forest management plans that&#13;
would result in significant conversion or degradation of critical&#13;
natural habitats, such habitats to be specifically identified through&#13;
the sectoral forestry environmental assessments;&#13;
f     all harvesting activities (commercial and community) to be within&#13;
the context of approved forest management plans; management&#13;
plans that include commercial logging to have prior environmental&#13;
assessments;&#13;
g.    all forest management activities to comply with pre-established&#13;
environmental and technical norms; and&#13;
h.    all forest management plans to include a formal process of public&#13;
consultation with affected municipalities, communities, and groups.&#13;
(b)   Upland Producer's Fund:&#13;
(i)   no financing of proposals with activities which would increase the&#13;
efficiency of natural resource exploitation or exploitation pressures except&#13;
within the context of an adequate management plan;&#13;
(ii)   no financing of proposals that would result in the conversion of forested&#13;
areas to other land uses;&#13;
(iii)  pre-financing inspection of all proposals;&#13;
(iv)   no financing of agrochemicals at farm-level;&#13;
(v)   financing of assistance to community-scale forest management only, no&#13;
industrial forest management assistance;&#13;
(vi)  all extractive activities in forest areas within context of forest management&#13;
plans and annual operating plans;&#13;
(vii)  all forest management plans and annual operating plans in state forest land&#13;
reviewed and approved by AFE-COHDEFOR, and&#13;
(viii)  all proposals to include participatory diagnostic which, inter alia, would&#13;
serve as a land use planning framework.&#13;

Box 3. AFE-COHDEFOR's TECHNCAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
STANDARDS IN CONIFEROUS FORESTS&#13;
Thefollowing should be read bearing in mind that the current trend to control and manage logging is extremelypositive and asyet, an&#13;
incipient effort Vile improvements are necesa    inh theflrst Istance, sinply bring theforests under some type of management and&#13;
reducing uncontrolled land conversions and "cut out and get out" logging practices will be the most stgnifcant long tenn contrbutonl&#13;
The observations below are intended to point out areas where inprovements might be targeted over the medluw-terna&#13;
A review of the current environmental and technical standards which fornt the basis for GOH's review and approval of firest management&#13;
plans, and subsequent enforcement of compliance reached the following conclusions:&#13;
Technical Adequacy&#13;
In the aggregate the current norms are reasonable in so far as they intend to address the site specific objectives of maintaining forest cover&#13;
over the long term, minimizing scondary disturbances, and assuring adequate regeneration. They are weak as regards minimizing off-site&#13;
impacts, logging in steep areas, selective Felling norns, and avoiding soil disturbances caused bv logging operations during periods of high&#13;
soil moisture. Avoidance of off-site impacts; specifically as regards water quality (sedimentation,. stream temperature, and BOD), requires&#13;
development of more specific standards in two areas in particular:&#13;
*   Roads - road standards regarding free passage of water are reasonable, however there is no provision for longer tenr stabiization of&#13;
road cuts and fills, maintenance of drainage structures (the "broad-based dip" utilized in the southern United States would be an&#13;
appropriate addition to road standards to address this problem), road approaches to streams, stream crossings, and road closings and.&#13;
recIamation (where this would be desirable and how it sbould be done).&#13;
&#149;   Protection of water sources and streams - the standards intend to afford this type of protection but fail to provide any clear guidelines.&#13;
No guidance is provided on: i) stream setbacks and harvesting in near-stream zones; ii) disposal of logging slash, iii) activities in and&#13;
around permanent and seasonal wetlands; and iv) siting of roads, skid paths, and logging decks relative to water sources and streams.&#13;
Setting of such standards is unavoidably arbitrary but is nonetheless necessary. Standards must be simple and directed at&#13;
maintaining natural shading of live stream courses, keeping logging slash out of the natural drainage patterns, maintaining buffer&#13;
zones amund springs and strearn courses sources, and avoiding logging activities in wetland areas.&#13;
*   Size and location of harvesting operations - no mention is made on upper limits to harvest areas and the proximity of harvest areas&#13;
from one year to the next. Guidelines should be developed to be applied on the basis of watersheds of third order streams or larger to&#13;
avoid overcutting and aggregate downstream effects on quickflows and sediment out of upland production forests.&#13;
In reference to the other points:&#13;
*   As to logging in steep areas, the norms require selective felling and use of cable ways. Undercurrentmarket, technil capacitv and&#13;
resource conditions such logging is not a viable option. Rather, in practice, logging of such areas is artesanal and will tend to cause&#13;
the development of permanent scars from uncontrolled downslope skidding. There is no easy solution to this problem; but neither is&#13;
it, as yet. a priority issue.&#13;
*   No norms exist regarding avoidance of high-grading sites through selective logging.&#13;
*   No norms exist as to keeping heavy equipment out of the forest, road building, or skidding during periods of high soil moisture to&#13;
avoid destruction of soil structure.&#13;
In all cases there is a need to arrive at more specific, operational guidelines for achieving desired objectives.&#13;
Environmental Nonrs&#13;
The current norms are weak and require improvement across the board.; however, their currentlv exists little information upon which to&#13;
base improvements. Resolution of this problem is larger than simply a forestry sector issue. Attempts are made in the current norms to&#13;
speak to conservation of habitat and wildlife, but there is no context within which this might be done. As a result the norms are reduced to&#13;
referring to nesting and breeding sites (snags). Additionally, no attempt is made to look at aggregate impacts of forest management&#13;
activities. Each management plan is developed and evaluated as totally independent unit. Broader landscape-scale norms related to&#13;
habitat species and aggregate impacts in given ecoregions and river basins should be the goal toward which efforts are directed. Working&#13;
toward this goal could. in the medium-term, provide a basis for more specific EA guidelines on the scale of the individual management&#13;
plan.&#13;
Capacity To Apply and Enforce Technical and Envirornenhtl Norms&#13;
Given that vcry little experience as yet exists with forest management (planning, application. supervision, and enforcement) it must&#13;
logically follow (and does) that little capacity exists to make the system work. The professional forester is identified as being responsible&#13;
for all aspects of management including the initial environmental assessments. Unavoidably, there will be errors from mistakes,&#13;
ignorance. and incompetence. This can only be managed through having modest goals and training coupled with on-the-ob experience&#13;
and adequate supervision.&#13;

20.   Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The project would finance neither land acquisition&#13;
nor activities which required resettlement. An assurance was obtained at negotiations to this&#13;
effect.&#13;
21.   Legal Framework.    Based on the Ley General del Ambiente (Decree N'. 104-93), the&#13;
Reglamento General de la Ley del Ambiente (Agreement N'. 109-93) and the Reglamento del&#13;
Sistema Nacional de Evaluaci6n de Impacto Ambiental (Agreement NQ. 109-93) Honduras has&#13;
put into effect an legal framework for environmental protection that has been reviewed by and&#13;
fouuM acceptable to IDA. The implementing mechanisms for these laws and regulations are&#13;
currently the focus of an ongoing IDA-financed project (Environmental Development Project, Cr.&#13;
2693-HO). A technical manual for the National Environmental Assessment System has been&#13;
developed by SERNA and would provide the initial basis for the project's environmental&#13;
assessment actions. This would later be complemented and/or superseded by the environmental,&#13;
assessment manual being developed by the AFE-COHDEFOR in cooperation with SERNA.&#13;

no harvesting in protected areas, no harvesting in humid tropical forests, etc.), "perfornance bonds", "application of&#13;
complementary, alternative administrative instruments within ProtectedAreas System. ", etc. - and are not included here.&#13;
These "costs" are implicit in project work program financing and are supported through training, technical assistance and&#13;
operational support (i.e., vehicles, per diems, materials, extension programs) and the Upland Producer's Fund.&#13;
2    Costs for activities related to monitoring and compliance with environmental and technical norms are, as in the above&#13;
footnote, implicit costs and can not be meaningfully separated out as distinct. The AFE's Department of Norms and&#13;
Control is charged with supervision and compliance (both environmental and technical). Project financing of vehicles,&#13;
communications equipment, training, forestry information systems, operational expenses, technical assistance, upgrading of&#13;
administration, etc. has direct objectives of assuring that the Dept. of Norms and Controls carries out its role.&#13;
3    The project is financing, aside from institutional strengthening and environmental assessment inputs, US$1.13 million of&#13;
varying scale (monitorable) forest management planning to ensure that, inter alia, all forest harvesting on national forest&#13;
lands is carried out only in areas suitable (environmentally and technically) for commercial logging. An additional&#13;
US$1.46 million will be invested in silvicultural treatments to optimize productivity and ensure regeneration in commaercial&#13;
logging areas. As the actual harvesting activities would be carried out by private sector loggers, the costs of meeting norms&#13;
are not project costs. Rather, these costs would be borne by the logger and would be reflected in the timber bid price.&#13;

HONDURAS&#13;
RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
SOCIAL ASSESSMENT AND PARTICIPATION PLAN&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    A social assessment was carried out as part of project preparation with the&#13;
following objectives: (a) to evaluate existing patterns of resource ownership,&#13;
management and use among different groups and institutions in the project area; (b) to&#13;
identify stake-holders who should be involved in preparation and implementation and to&#13;
obtain their inputs on project scope and design; (c) to identify potentially negative&#13;
impacts of proposed activities on vulnerable groups in the population, including women&#13;
and indigenous groups, and design measures to prevent or mitigate these impacts; and&#13;
(d) to identify opportunities to build local capacity of NGOs, producer and traditional&#13;
organizations and local government to plan and carry out project activities. A&#13;
Participation Action Plan was prepared as one product of that social assessment. This&#13;
annex summarizes the findings of the social assessment and the recommendations that&#13;
have been included in the Participation Action Plan. This includes findings and&#13;
recommendations on indigenous peoples and gender concerns and a matrix extracting&#13;
costs of activities related to participation and incorporation of special interest groups&#13;
from the overall cost tables.&#13;
SOCIAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS&#13;
2.    The social assessment included: (a) analysis of the stake-holders in the land&#13;
administration and natural resources sector; (b) a participatory rural appraisal of&#13;
representative communities in the Natural Resources Management component area by a&#13;
multi-disciplinary team; (c) analysis of an extensive secondary literature on social impacts&#13;
of the land titling program; (d) meetings with NGOs working with upland farmers and&#13;
forest producers throughout the country; (e) meetings with members of the national&#13;
indigenous federation and with traditional leaders, including indigenous leaders, in the&#13;
project area; and (f) a workshop with women's organizations to elicit their views on&#13;
project design. An international gender specialist and two international indigenous/social&#13;
specialists participated in preparation to oversee in-country work on these aspects of&#13;
project design. Because there would not be significant potentially negative impacts on&#13;
indigenous groups, no separate Indigenous Peoples Development Plan was prepared, but&#13;
instead the activities related to indigenous peoples development have been described&#13;
within the overall plan of participation.&#13;

PROFILE OF PROJECT BENEFICIARIES AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
POPULATION IN THE UPLANDS AND THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
3.    There are, according to the 1993 agricultural census, 237,863 farm families with&#13;
less than 10 hectare covering 587,576 hectares of land and 227,642 farms of less than 5&#13;
hectares with 384,078 hectares in Honduras. Most of the farmers with less than 5&#13;
hectares are found in the marginal uplands. Families with less than 10 hectares farm&#13;
17.6% of all agricultural holdings in the country, and comprise 54.3% of the population.&#13;
These small holders produce mainly white maize, beans, a creole variety sorghum&#13;
(maicillo), and rice. Maize is produced by 75 % of small-scale farmers and beans by a&#13;
third. Sorghum is produced by 52% of farmers in the south and is used primarily as cattle&#13;
feed. There is little reliable data on the extent of cattle pasture, but it is extensive-- 1993&#13;
census figures are 1.5 million hectares under pasture while extrapolations from 1991&#13;
region-1 data estimate 2.6 million hectares under pasture. In comparison to other Central&#13;
American countries, the cattle expansion phase began later and continued after political&#13;
conflicts had checked expansion in neighboring countries.&#13;
4.    Many of the upland farmers cultivate land classified as part of the public forest&#13;
estate. As described in Annex B, Land Administration Component, farmers cultivating&#13;
lands classified as public are eligible for title should the land be judged of agricultural&#13;
vocation. All other lands are classified as forest vocation and can be cultivated through&#13;
usufruct, but not titled. The main forested areas of the north and west are the agricultural&#13;
frontier. Many of the upland farmers in this area migrated from poorer regions in the&#13;
south and east or moved into the hilly areas after selling their plots to cattle ranchers.&#13;
Since 1982, Honduras has had an active land titling program to give title to smallholders&#13;
settled on agricultural lands within the public estate. Through this program, 77,000 titles&#13;
have been given for about 660,000 hectares. In addition, some cooperatives were given&#13;
titles, but by 1993 only 993 of these remained with 144,697 hectares, mostly in the&#13;
valleys. Most of the former cooperative members are seeking individual titles from INA.&#13;
The number of farm families still without title is estimated to be around 200,000 of which&#13;
about one half would not qualify for title since their holding is less than 1 hectare or&#13;
classified as urban areas. The first phase of the land administration pilot in 15&#13;
municipalities alone is predicted to identify 6,000 farms eligible for title.&#13;
5.    The small-farmer population in the 14 public forest management field unit&#13;
boundaries of the three Departments included in the project area--Yoro, Olancho and San&#13;
Francisco Morazon--is 14,775 families. These are the majority of families in the project&#13;
area. While land holding figures are not available for the upland areas of these&#13;
Departments, more than 95% of the families in the rapid rural appraisal communities&#13;
were small-holders with less than 2.5 has. and the majority had some land holdings in&#13;
addition to their homesteads, however marginal. Most did not have title to their&#13;
agricultural holdings. Apart from limited mid and larger sized farmers in the valleys and&#13;
some uplands of the project Departments, therefore, the large majority of the upland&#13;
farmers are small, subsistence farmers with marginal holdings, both in size and quality.&#13;
The upland fund would provide support to landed farmers in agriculture and agro-&#13;

INDIGENOUS PEOPLE&#13;
6.   In Honduras, the indigenous population (including black Caribbean communities)&#13;
is organized in eight separate indigenous groups, numbering about 293,000 inhabitants&#13;
and comprising 12.8 percent of the total population (1988 Census). Membership to a&#13;
specific group is determined by language affiliation. The eight groups and their location&#13;
are the following:&#13;
*  Lenca in the La Paz; Intibuca; Lempira and Santa Barbara Departments, with&#13;
100,000 inhabitants&#13;
*  Xicaques or Tolupanes, with 28 tribes distributed in 6 municipalities of&#13;
Yoro Department; and 19,300 people in Orica and Marales of Francisco&#13;
Morazan Department.&#13;
-  Garifuna or "caribes negros" in Cortez; Atlantida; Col6n; Gracias a Dios and&#13;
Islas de la Bahia, with a estimated population of 98,000 inhabitants,&#13;
distributed in 38 communities&#13;
-  Miskitos, in Gracias a Dios Department with about 49,000 inhabitants,&#13;
distributed in 107 communities&#13;
-  Pech or Paya, distributed in the Dulce, Nombre de Culmi and San Esteban&#13;
municipalities in the Olancho Department; and Brus Laguna in the Gracias a&#13;
Dios Department with 2,600 inhabitants&#13;
*  Tawahka or Sumus, with 900 inhabitants in 7 communities along the Rio&#13;
Patuca River&#13;
*  Chorti, in Copan and Ocotepeque Departments with about 4,200 inhabitants.&#13;
*  Islefios or Black Population with a distinct language found in the Litoral&#13;
Atlantico in the Ceiba, Tela, Puerto Cortez and the Islas de la Bahia with&#13;
about 20,000 inhabitants&#13;
7.   In the area of influence of the natural resources component there are 16,800&#13;
indigenous people, making up 21 percent of the total population of the area. In addition,&#13;
the protected areas component would strengthen staffing in the Mosquitia Region to&#13;
complement the proposed GEF project under preparation. The protected area in this&#13;
region includes a significant portion of the 49,000 Miskitos and Tawahkas distributed in&#13;
107 communities. While there are no indigenous populations in the pilot areas of the land&#13;
&#13;

INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
8.   Indigenous organizations in general combine elements of their traditional culture&#13;
with those of the non-indigenous society, including economic strategies, politico-&#13;
administrative aspects and religious factors. The levels of organizations go from the&#13;
community (village, township) to tribal and regional ethnic organizations. Particularly in&#13;
recent times, the lower level organizations have formed federations at the ethnic level.&#13;
Nevertheless, these organizations are still fairly weak and vulnerable to outside factors.&#13;
The relative weakness affects the federations' capacity to carry out effective actions in&#13;
favor of their members and this in turn makes them more susceptible to criticism.&#13;
*  The Lenca people are represented by the Organizaci6n Indigena Lenca de&#13;
Honduras (ONILH), formed by the Consejos Indigenas Locales (Indigenous&#13;
Councils at the municipal level) and the Consejo Indigena Departmental&#13;
(Indigenous Council at the departmental level). This organization is still in&#13;
process of formation and has only 4,000 members, belonging to 36&#13;
communities.&#13;
*  The Tolupanes are represented by the Federaci6n de Tribus Xicaques de&#13;
Yoro (FETRIXY), whose first-tier organizations are the Asambleas de&#13;
Tribus (Tribes Assemblies), Congreso de Tribus (Tribal Congress), Consejo&#13;
Directivo (Board of Directors) and Comite Ejecutivo (Executive Committee).&#13;
*  The Pech have organized at national level in the Federaci6n de Tribus Pech&#13;
de Honduras (FETRIPH), following the Tolupanes model.&#13;
*  The Misquitos are represented by the Mosquitia-Asla Takanka - Unidad&#13;
de la Mosquitia (MASTA). This in turn is formed by seven federations. In&#13;
reality, the organization of the Misquitos is very loose. Alliances are not&#13;
permanent, usually involving geographic or commercial interests under the&#13;
leadership of a Zuqia or Tribal Chief.&#13;
*  The Chorti are not organized at the national level. This is one specific case of&#13;
a population who have been heavily acculturated and largely become&#13;
campesinos.&#13;
*  The Garifunas are represented by the Organizaci6n Fraternal Negra&#13;
Hondurefia (OFRANEH), although its degree of representation is weak.&#13;
*  The Tawahka have organized the Federaci6n Indigena Tawahka of&#13;
Honduras (FITH), but it is also in the process of consolidation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H3&#13;
Page 5 of 14&#13;
9.    Since 1992, all of the above indigenous organizations and peoples, except for the&#13;
Chorti and Islefios, are members of a national level organization, the Coordinadora&#13;
Nacional de Pueblos Autoctonos de Honduras (CONPAH).&#13;
NON-INDIGENOUS POPULATION&#13;
10.  In the area of influence of the Natural Resources Management component, non-&#13;
indigenous groups represent 66,200 inhabitants, or 79 percent of the total population.&#13;
The relevant forms of organization are based on productive activities and upon&#13;
geographical coverage and include: (a) Productive Cooperatives at the first-tier level of&#13;
organization, in general based at community level; (b) Patronatos; with local level&#13;
community base organization and no juridical recognition; (c) Municipalities; at the&#13;
municipal or lowest level of formal government organization; (d) Agro-forestry&#13;
Federations as second-tier productive organizations; and (e) Confederations or third-tier&#13;
organizations. Coffee is an important cash crop in the uplands and farmers' cooperatives&#13;
are strongly linked to the Honduran Coffee Institute's prograrn of research and extension.&#13;
The first- and second-tier organizations in Honduras are beginning to mature as strong,&#13;
independent entities, rather than serving as in the past as a relatively weak entity within&#13;
stronger top-down federations.&#13;
11.  There is also a number of NGOs which work in the project area with upland&#13;
farmers and forestry organizations providing rural development assistance and capacity&#13;
building, which are described in Annex D. Some of the more national NGOs have begun&#13;
to work with first and second-tier organizations to develop their capacity to deliver&#13;
development assistance. The unique feature of the more successful NGOs is the use of a&#13;
farmer-to-farmer extension methodology, whereby interested farmers are trained in the&#13;
basic principles of a new practice and encouraged to experiment in adapting the practice&#13;
to their own farm and in transferring the knowledge of basic principles to other&#13;
interested farmers. The system of information transfer which results is self-sustaining&#13;
and usually leads to adoption of practices which are appropriate to the farmers' needs&#13;
and resources. The large majority of farmers in the uplands are not linked to formal&#13;
credit institutions and, even in the informal sector, the main source of capital is&#13;
household savings. A few NGOs, such as FINCA-Honduras or World Relief, have&#13;
established savings mobilization programs to organize farmers' groups for informal&#13;
credit networks. There is a considerable potential for such mobilization, particularly&#13;
with rural women.&#13;
12.  For the Land Administration Modernization component the estimated population&#13;
is 1,679,042 inhabitants spread over 46,640.9 km2 in the Departments of Comayagua,&#13;
Cortes, Yoro and Olancho.&#13;
KEY ISSUES FOR PARTICIPATION AND ACTION PLANS&#13;
13.  The social assessment has identified a number of key issues which have been&#13;
addressed in project design, as described below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H3&#13;
Page 6 of 14&#13;
(a)   Land and Forest Tenure. For indigenous populations, there are&#13;
constraints to registration of indigenous land and forest rights under the&#13;
folio real, due to the lack of legal identify of most of the first-tier&#13;
indigenous community organizations that comprise ethnic federations and&#13;
to the overlapping of traditional indigenous areas of influence and private&#13;
land holdings established during the colonial and post-colonial period by&#13;
hispanic families. Currently, under the Land Reform Law and the&#13;
Agricultural Modernization Law, indigenous groups can elect either to&#13;
receive individual or communal title to lands within traditional, indigenous&#13;
territories. As in other countries of Latin America, Honduran indigenous&#13;
groups are increasingly electing the communal title option to help preserve&#13;
tenure to traditional territories. Communal title also has implications for&#13;
forest tenure as indigenous populations are more likely to legitimate title&#13;
to forest areas within their territories when their entire domain is titled&#13;
communally. Otherwise such areas are considered national forests owned&#13;
by the State.&#13;
Recommended Action: There are several ways in which the Land&#13;
Administration component would address indigenous tenure issues. The&#13;
initial land adjudication in Comayagua does not affect indigenous&#13;
populations, but the land and forest tenure issues would be explored by&#13;
indigenous groups under the IDF grant currently being processed. It is&#13;
expected that concrete recommendations would emerge from the IDF-&#13;
funded activities which can be used to modify the pilot approach, as&#13;
needed. As the adjudication process is extended to Olancho and Yoro,&#13;
both with indigenous populations, the system would be modified to&#13;
address these issues. Teams of INA promoters involved in the&#13;
adjudication process would also receive special orientation and training.&#13;
If requested, indigenous groups can also be provided legal assistance and&#13;
training to establish the legal identify of first-tier organizations seeking&#13;
separate forest rights or communal tenure at a more appropriate level.&#13;
The associated GEF project would have more specific actions on the&#13;
demarcation of protected areas and adjudication of indigenous rights to&#13;
forest areas within protected areas and surrounding buffer zones.&#13;
(b)   Role of Traditional Organizations and Farmers' Groups. The role of&#13;
indigenous traditional organizations and of productive organizations has&#13;
not been effectively analyzed in SAG programs in the past, with the result&#13;
that participation has often been focused on leaders of federations who do&#13;
not represent the first-tier organizations adequately. Nor is there a&#13;
transparent process for consultation of these organizations by the&#13;
municipal authorities in local development initiatives.&#13;
Recommended Action: This issue has been explored in project design&#13;
and productive organizations have been consulted at various stages in the&#13;
design of the natural resources and upland fund components by DICTA,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H3&#13;
Page 7 of 14&#13;
AFE-COHDEFOR, and UPEG. Training and orientation activities&#13;
coordinated by the PCU are planned for the implementation of these two&#13;
components on indigenous political organization and opportunities for&#13;
broader participation and on consultation with farmers' groups interested&#13;
in preparing proposals or seeking assistance from appropriate NGOs.&#13;
NGOs are also eligible to include requests in their proposals for technical&#13;
assistance funds to build capacity of first- and second-tier organizations to&#13;
develop their own research and extension packages. In the development&#13;
of management strategies for ejido forests under municipal jurisdiction,&#13;
AFE-COHDEFOR extension staff and consultants would ensure the&#13;
consultation process explores the potential role of a wide range of local&#13;
organizations. To ensure wider participation in the Upland Fund, criteria&#13;
and procedures have been designed to be transparent and relatively simple.&#13;
These criteria would be evaluated at mid-term and adjusted based on this&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
(c)   Forest Management and Use. Except for the pilot initiatives in smaller&#13;
blocks of forest, such as those implemented with Canadian and Finnish&#13;
assistance, there has not been a systematic process of determining the&#13;
relative rights and interests of communities residing in and around forest&#13;
areas or for allocating use rights for traditional or new products. Nor&#13;
have these populations benefited from economic analysis of the relative&#13;
returns from different management strategies, whether management of&#13;
small blocks by cooperative groups or management on a more commercial&#13;
scale to attract larger, private harvesting and processing enterprises and&#13;
local employment.&#13;
Recommended Action: The Natural Resources Management component&#13;
defines a process for incorporating local populations in the design and&#13;
implementation of forest master plans for the forestry and protected areas&#13;
included in the project. This process would be refined, based on overall&#13;
criteria agreed during preparation, through a work program under the&#13;
general direction of the PCU and involving the extension wing of AFE-&#13;
COHDEFOR and the parks department. The Upland Fund would finance&#13;
proposals for support to municipalities and cooperative groups seeking to&#13;
develop forest management and forest enterprise capacity, as well as&#13;
provide technical assistance and training to upland residents seeking wider&#13;
employment in forestry enterprises, both formal and informal. A system of&#13;
consultation would be built into forest management plans to ensure&#13;
updating of management plans through a participatory process involving&#13;
relevant stake-holders.&#13;
(d)  Participation in Decision-Making and Implementation. The&#13;
participatory rural appraisal identified a number of constraints to&#13;
participation the design of government programs and their&#13;
implementation, including the lack of knowledge of government activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H3&#13;
Page 8 of 14&#13;
by more remote uplanid populations, the lack of formal property rights of&#13;
upland inhabitants which excluded them from many programs, and the&#13;
lack of institutional and financial capacity of municipal offices to design&#13;
and implement long-term development programs.&#13;
Recommended Action: The project would include a system of&#13;
participatory monitoring and evaluation that includes the project&#13;
beneficiaries and their local organizations in the periodic evaluation of the&#13;
success of project activities and would include orientation and training of&#13;
beneficiaries in the design of M&amp;E indicators and tools that enable them&#13;
to express their opinions about the progress of the project. In particular,&#13;
the consultant firm (Fund Manager) eliciting and evaluating proposals for&#13;
the Upland Fund would train beneficiaries or work with participating&#13;
NGOs to train beneficiaries in these methods and channel conclusions to&#13;
the Advisory Committee. Forest master plans would also be monitored by&#13;
local communities and municipal authorities.&#13;
(e)   Project Management Capacity to Implement Participation Plan.&#13;
There is little social science or participatory planning and implementation&#13;
expertise in UPEG or the various departments within AFE-COHDEFOR&#13;
or DICTA that would ensure a comprehensive vision for implementing the&#13;
Participation Plan or provide guidance to implementing staff of other&#13;
disciplines. While INA has considerable experience with field adjudication&#13;
of land tenure rights, there is no central office responsible for indigenous&#13;
policy, apart from some attention to the issues by one of the legal&#13;
specialists. Nor is there a clear responsibility for gender or indigenous&#13;
issues within SAG for longer-term sustainability of activities.&#13;
Recommended Action. SAG would contract a specialist in social and&#13;
participation issues for the PCU who would oversee incorporation of&#13;
these issues into the project components, implementation of the elements&#13;
of the participation plan, and supervision of consultants contracted to&#13;
undertake special studies or specific participation or consultation&#13;
activities. This specialist would also work with UPEG/UPEG, advising&#13;
the unit on how best to coordinate attention to these issues within SAG&#13;
and suggesting staffing needs. AFE-COHDEFOR plans to strengthen the&#13;
capacity of the Promotion and Extension Department and to work with&#13;
the newly created Center for Training and Research on Environment and&#13;
Sustainable Forestry Development in Lapaterique on training of&#13;
indigenous organizations. The Division of Legal Services in INA plans to&#13;
develop a strategy for addressing indigenous tenure issues in the land&#13;
adjudication process, which would be discussed with indigenous&#13;
organizations.&#13;
(f)    Gender Considerations. The difference in access to land and agricultural&#13;
and forestry production support services between men and women, has a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H3&#13;
Page 9 of 14&#13;
relevant impact on the economy of rural households and reduces rural&#13;
development opportunities. Though women represent an important group&#13;
among rural producers, they have received minimum benefits from the&#13;
land titling program or from agriculture or forestry services. While more&#13;
women are receiving land titles since the Agricultural Modernization Law&#13;
recognized their land rights, many women in the project area reside in&#13;
areas of forest vocation that cannot be titled. There is also little titling of&#13;
couples, especially since common law marriages are not recognized as a&#13;
basis for joint land titling in the absence of onerous documentation.&#13;
Recommended Action: To address the overall lack of a gender&#13;
orientation in the activities of the SAG agencies involved in the project, a&#13;
program of gender training would be designed and implemented. This&#13;
training program would be targeted to all professional and technical&#13;
personnel of the public institutions responsible for the coordination and&#13;
implementation of the components, to private development organizations&#13;
and NGOs providing services in the rural areas, especially through the&#13;
Upland Producers' Fund. Both PDOs and NGOs would need to receive&#13;
training as a condition to be eligible to provide services, the cost of&#13;
training would be their responsibility. The program would be under the&#13;
PCU and would be implemented by the Pan-American Agricultural School&#13;
-- El Zamorano -- where a permanent information network would be set&#13;
up for service training providers at national and Central American levels.&#13;
Training would be aimed to address specific detected needs of each&#13;
component. The criteria for selection of proposals for the Upland Fund&#13;
would also include preference for technical assistance targeted explicitly to&#13;
women farmers and forest managers. INA and CSJ have agreed to&#13;
evaluate the restrictions on joint titling of common law couples and to&#13;
present an action plan for increasing women's access to land. Project&#13;
performance indicators have also been included to measure progress on&#13;
the incorporation of gender concerns.&#13;
LDF FOR STRENGTHENING OF INDIGENOUS INSTITUTIONS&#13;
14.  The IDF which has been identified for indigenous strengthening would provide&#13;
resources for capacity-building in a number of areas related to natural resources&#13;
management and land tenure. Indigenous groups seek training in local planning and&#13;
design of development initiatives, technical and business management tools to evaluate&#13;
their capacity to undertake forestry-based enterprises, tools for community forestry&#13;
management, including sites in and around protected areas, and training in legal aspects&#13;
of individual and communal land tenure systems to enable members to make more&#13;
educated decisions about the type of land tenure which would most benefit themselves&#13;
and their families. The outputs of the IDF would include building capacity of indigenous&#13;
groups to make proposals to the Upland Fund and to participate more pro-actively in&#13;
forest management and protected areas activities.&#13;

            Honduras - Rural Land Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Rural Land
            Management Project are to: a) modernize the system of rural
            land registration; b) strengthen the forest administration
            of the State Forestry Administration-Honduran Forestry
            Development Corporation and promote local participation in
            managing natural resources; c) improve agriculture and
            forestry practices in upland farms; and d) rationalize the
            national protected areas systems. The project will finance a
            five year program with two components. The land
            administration modernization component will test and install
            a land administration modernization system based on folio
            real. The second component, natural resources management,
            will finance: a) forest management with local participation,
            b) improved upland agriculture and forestry, c) building
            capacity in producer organizations and NGOs, and d)
            management of key protected areas and design of strategies
            for self financing in the protected areas systems.
