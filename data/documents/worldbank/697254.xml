AZERBAIJAN REPUBLIC&#13;
GREATER BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:              Azerbaijan Republic&#13;
Beneficiary:           Apsheron Regional Water Company (ARWC)&#13;
Amount:                SDR 38.8 Million (US$61 Million Equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                 IDA Standard with 35-years' maturity, including 10 years of grace.&#13;
Onlending Terms:       Ministry of Finance will onlend the IDA and EBRD funds to the ARWC over&#13;
25 years, including 5 years of grace, at 7 percent interest.&#13;
Objectives:            The primary objectives of the Project are to: (a) make emergency short term&#13;
improvements in the water supply system to restore the water supply to Baku,&#13;
in particular to the poorer elements of the population; (b) improve the water&#13;
supply system as a whole; and (c) provide the basis for longer term planning&#13;
and recovery.&#13;
Project Description:    The Project will comprise five major components:&#13;
Water Demand Management - conserving water at the household level through&#13;
a program of consumer awareness initiatives, through repairs to in-home&#13;
plumbing, valves, taps and other fittings, and by rationalizing water use&#13;
through meter installations and the implementation of a progressive water&#13;
tariff;&#13;
Operations and Maintenance Improvements - increasing the amount of water&#13;
available from the distribution system through a program of leak detection and&#13;
repair, workshop and equipment acquisition, and at least a one year inventory&#13;
of selected replacement valves and pipes;&#13;
Supply Improvements - improving the quantity and quality of water from the&#13;
treatment works and enhancing the reliability of the distribution network&#13;
through a program of selective rehabilitation of the major water treatment&#13;
plants and pumping stations;&#13;
Institutional Capacity Building - reorganizing the water utility into a joint&#13;
stock company (ARWC); consolidating its offices in a new headquarters&#13;
building; strengthening its institutional capacity through a twinning&#13;
arrangement with an experienced water utility; purchase and installation of&#13;
computers and requisite software programs; and the development and&#13;
implementation of training programs aimed at improving both operational and&#13;
administrative effectiveness; and&#13;
Studies - preparation and implementation of a national policy framework for&#13;
the water sector, preparation of a regional water supply and sewerage master&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- jj -&#13;
plan, and the development of a second phase Project.&#13;
Project Benefits:      The Project is the least-cost solution in terms of yielding maximum benefits&#13;
and significantly reducing the public health risks associated with the existing&#13;
quantity and quality of water. The benefits resulting from the project would&#13;
include: (i) an improvement in public health standards by reducing the&#13;
incidence of waterborne and water related diseases; and (ii) a reduction in the&#13;
need to invest in "coping" mechanisms by the families who do not get&#13;
adequate water. In financial terms, the poor would benefit most from an&#13;
improved supply system. However, in terms of improved water quality, both&#13;
low and high-income families would benefit in equal proportions. Further,&#13;
improvements to the quality and quantity of water extend beyond Baku to the&#13;
half million or more people living within the metropolitan region. The Project&#13;
will also assist the productive sectors by increasing the availability of a&#13;
critically needed commodity, notably a reliable and sustainable supply of&#13;
potable water.&#13;
Environmental Impact: An environmental review has been prepared consistent with the provisions of&#13;
the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment"&#13;
and the applicable environmental procedures of the Government of Azerbaijan.&#13;
The Project has been placed in environmental screening category "B", since&#13;
most of the potential impacts are expected to be beneficial.&#13;
Project Risks:         There are risks inherent to a first-time investment operation for a new&#13;
borrower. These risks include: (a) delays in Project implementation due to the&#13;
limited experience of ARWC in this type of activity; (b) possible&#13;
understatement of construction costs due to the limited experience of ARWC&#13;
with actual costs for implementation and previous lack of construction&#13;
experience to meet international standards in this sector; (c) reluctance of the&#13;
Government to face up to the challenges of implementing the requisite sector&#13;
and institutional reforms; (d) underestimating the extraordinary effort and&#13;
long-term commitment required to achieve financial viability in the water&#13;
supply sector; and (e) unrealistic and hence demoralizing expectations that the&#13;
Baku water supply crisis could be resolved quickly. These risks will be&#13;
reduced through the early establishment of a twinning arrangement with&#13;
another water utility, by significant supervision by staff from Bank&#13;
headquarters, by the use of appropriate physical and price contingencies, by&#13;
the on-going dialogue with the Government and ARWC, by building the&#13;
capacity of ARWC to carry out its responsibilities effectively through&#13;
extensive technical assistance support, and by an extensive public&#13;
information/education program to be financed under the Project.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN REPUBLIC&#13;
GREATER BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
1.1        Country Profile. Azerbaijan lies on the southeastern flanks of the Caucasus mountains,&#13;
bounded on the north by Georgia and the Russian Federation, on the east by the Caspian Sea, on the&#13;
south by the Islamic Republic of Iran, and on the west by Armenia (see IBRD Map No. 26892). It is&#13;
one of the smallest countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU), covering an area of about 86,000 kIn2,&#13;
similar to Austria. Azerbaijan is endowed with fertile agricultural land and natural resources, including&#13;
substantial underdeveloped petroleum reserves, and contains one of the oldest oil-producing regions of&#13;
the world. Oil production has been declining, however, because existing fields have reached a state of&#13;
advanced depletion and agreements to develop new fields are only now being concluded. The country&#13;
also has a diversified industrial structure, a relatively well-educated labor force, and a buoyant and&#13;
rapidly expanding private sector.&#13;
1.2        The population of Azerbaijan is estimated at about 7.4 million people in 1993, compared&#13;
to 6 million in 1979 and 5.1 million in 1970. These statistics indicate a declining growth rate, from 1.7&#13;
percent per annum during the period 1970-79, to about 1.2 percent during the period 1989-93. By 1993,&#13;
over half of the population lived in urban areas.&#13;
1.3        Notwithstanding its political independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has continued to remain&#13;
closely tied to the FSU. The country remained in the ruble zone throughout 1992, and the deeply&#13;
entrenched economic interdependence continues. In addition to transitional difficulties, the unsettled&#13;
situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and the continuous conflict with Armenia has contributed to a drastic&#13;
decline in output. The large number of refugees (about one million) and the occupation of territories by&#13;
Armenian forces have been a major contributor to political instability in the country. As a result,&#13;
Azerbaijan has undergone frequent governmental changes. These unfavorable developments have also&#13;
been influential in diverting the Government's attention away from addressing the economic and reform&#13;
challenges facing the nation.&#13;
1.4        During 1992, after three years of relatively small declines, Azerbaijan's economy underwent&#13;
a particularly sharp contraction with a rapid acceleration of inflation. These trends continued into 1993&#13;
and early 1994. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1993 was only about 60 percent of its 1988 level.&#13;
The worsening economic situation in 1993 was also marked by a serious deterioration in both fiscal and&#13;
external balances. Nonetheless, the Government initiated reform measures to liberalize the economy and&#13;
ensure the transition to a market economy. In this connection, the Government took an early decision&#13;
to introduce a national currency, the manat, liberalized most prices, initiated financial sector reforms, and&#13;
began developing the necessary legal and institutional framework to support these changes. On the other&#13;
hand, enterprise restructuring and land reform were limited. However, the recent cease-fire and the&#13;
improved prospects for peace in Nagorno-Karabakh have strengthened the Government's determination&#13;
to accelerate comprehensive reforms. The Government has concluded the purchase under the IMF's&#13;
Systemic Transformation Facility for a comprehensive program of stabilization and structural reform,&#13;
and has requested the Bank to support its reform efforts with a Rehabilitation Credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Regional Context&#13;
1.5        Greater Baku. Because the economy of Azerbaijan relies heavily on a diversified range&#13;
of activities performed by the Central Government, Baku dominates the metropolitan region. Its position&#13;
as the seat of Government and the principal educational, cultural and industrial center of the country,&#13;
further increases its attractiveness to the most talented professionals, who are reluctant to locate outside&#13;
of the city because of less promising career prospects. Thus, the urban structure of Azerbaijan exhibits&#13;
a striking degree of primacy, with more than two-thirds of the urban population or 2.5 million people&#13;
concentrated in Greater Baku'. As shown in Table 1.1, the 1993 population of Baku was estimated at&#13;
about 1.7 million inhabitants, but this figure may have increased to more than 2 million as a result of the&#13;
influx of refugees from the conflict in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. However, it is envisaged that&#13;
future population growth will be moderate and many of the refugees are expected to return to their homes&#13;
once the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is resolved. With the population of Greater Baku projected to reach&#13;
only about 2.8 million people by the year 2015, demographic pressures arising from rapid population&#13;
growth are not expected to be significant in the demand for urban services.&#13;

1.6        Urban Amenities. Early records mention the existence of Baku in the fifth century,&#13;
although present-day Baku did not really begin to develop until the middle of the nineteenth century when&#13;
the first oil well was drilled in Bibi-Eibat (1847) on the western promontory of Baku Bay. Additional&#13;
oil developments followed in the second half of the nineteenth century, and by the beginning of the&#13;
twentieth century, the area accounted for about 50 percent of the world's crude oil production. This new&#13;
wealth sparked the development of Baku's western waterfront with the construction of mansions, schools,&#13;
libraries, hospitals, parks and gardens, hotels, concert halls, museums, and an opera house. The city's&#13;
first public water supply system was constructed in 1917. Present-day Baku has all of the basic attributes&#13;
of a modern urban center, including an extensive transport network, an underground metro system, an&#13;
international airport, and the largest port on the Caspian Sea (nine general cargo berths, a ferry terminal,&#13;
and specialized facilities for dry and liquid bulk cargoes). Many of these facilities, however, suffer from&#13;
significant deferred maintenance.&#13;
' Includes Baku City, the industrial complex of Sumgait City and the Apsheron Districts of Karadag, Surakhani,&#13;
Sabunchu and Azizbekov.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.7          Employment Base. A high proportion of the population in Greater Baku is recorded as&#13;
economically active--1992 estimates indicate a participation rate of 55 percent (which is common in&#13;
central and Eastern Europe, but is high in comparison to Western Europe). The unemployment rate was&#13;
estimated at 10 percent in 1992, although this figure may have risen sharply in the light of the difficult&#13;
economic conditions and the decline in industrial capacity utilization following the collapse of the&#13;
guaranteed market under the FSU. In Greater Baku, industry accounts for about 25 to 30 percent of&#13;
employment, while government, conmmercial and service sectors represents a further 50 to 55 percent of&#13;
employment. There are more than 400 industrial plants in the metropolitan region, mainly comprising&#13;
oil refining, chemicals, engineering, and machinery. This industrial base is complemented by a broad&#13;
range of medium-scale industries, notably food processing, tobacco and beverages, textiles, consumer&#13;
goods, building materials, metal and metal products, electrical equipment, plastics, and rubber products.&#13;
1.8        Health Profile. General health indicators show that in 1990 life expectancy at birth was&#13;
71 years of age, with infant mortality at 23 per 1,000 live births. These levels compare favorably with&#13;
other Central Asian Republics, but there is cause for concern that the general social and health conditions&#13;
may decline in light of the current economic crisis and the rapid deterioration of basic infrastructure and&#13;
environmental facilities. Morbidity figures indicate a high incidence of hospitalized cases of waterborne&#13;
and water-related diseases. Moreover, recent data suggest that the more life-threatening diseases such&#13;
as typhoid/para-typhoid, viral hepatitis, and cholera are spreading in the region.&#13;
1.9        Climatic and Spatial Characteristics. The capital city of Baku is located on the edge of&#13;
Baku Bay on the southern side of the long narrow Apsheron Peninsula, which extends about 60 km into&#13;
the Caspian Sea. The prevailing climate on the peninsula is dry and subtropical in the summer with&#13;
average daily temperatures of about +260 C in July and August, and dry and cold in the winter with&#13;
average daily temperatures of about +30 C in January. Annual precipitation is 110 to 250 nun per year,&#13;
and falls mainly in early spring and late autumn. Because of these climatic conditions, Baku traditionally&#13;
has had to rely on distant water sources to satisfy domestic, industrial, and agricultural demand (see IBRD&#13;
Map No. 26892). The spatial distribution of the city is divided into four main zones:&#13;
(a)  the Central Business District (CBD), with a population density of about 2,679 people per&#13;
km2, faces the waterfront at the western end of Baku Bay and comprises the old city, most&#13;
central government organizations, commercial offices, cultural amenities and almost all of&#13;
the hotels. A large industrial area is also located at the western point of the bay along with&#13;
oil wells;&#13;
(b)  the Central Eastern Area, with a population density of about 6,719 people per krn2, also&#13;
fronts the bay and comprises large industrial enterprises, heavy industries, informal&#13;
settlements established near the factories, and numerous high-rise apartment buildings along&#13;
the periphery;&#13;
(c)  the Western Area, with population densities ranging between 13,375 and 19,900 people per&#13;
km2, is dominated by residential high-rise apartment buildings, although future expansion&#13;
is constrained by the surrounding hills; and&#13;
(d)  the Eastern Area, with population densities ranging between 770 people and 7,950 people&#13;
per kmi2, comprises both medium and heavy industries, residential development and small-&#13;
scale garden agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. Sectoral Context&#13;
1.10       Institutional Setting. In the past, control over fiscal management and national and regional&#13;
planning was highly centralized in Moscow. Since independence, these functions have been assumed by&#13;
the national government, but continue to be administered through a conunand-style hierarchy similar to&#13;
that which existed before. Jurisdictionally, the water supply and sewerage sector is the responsibility of&#13;
the following five ministries:&#13;
(a)   Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) - is responsible for the overall national water balance&#13;
including the allocation of surface water resources between potable water and agricultural&#13;
use, and is also responsible for the operation, maintenance and ownership of all dams,&#13;
canals and lakes;&#13;
(b)   Ministry of Geology (MOG) - responsible for all groundwater resources and is the&#13;
originating agency for issuing groundwater extraction licenses as well as serving as an&#13;
advisor to the various Governmental agencies on matters associated with water resource&#13;
development;&#13;
(c)   Ministry of Health (MOH) - responsible for setting the quality standards for drinking&#13;
water, although in practice there is little or no effective enforcement of those standards,&#13;
despite the fact that many water samples in the Baku area do not meet the required&#13;
standards;&#13;
(d)   State Ecology Committee (SEC) - responsible for regulating environmental standards--&#13;
while this agency is developing an appropriate legislative framework, effective enforcement&#13;
is constrained by lack of resources due to the current economic situation; and&#13;
(e)   Ministry of Housing and Communal Property (MOHCP) - owns and operates regional&#13;
and municipal water supply and sewerage agencies, which are responsible for the bulk&#13;
transmission, treatment and distribution of potable water and the collection and disposal of&#13;
sewage. The exception is rural areas, which fall under the jurisdiction of the MOI, and&#13;
which are usually supplied by pipelines with the dual function of providing both agricultural&#13;
and domestic water.&#13;
1.11       Sewerage services are provided by the MOHCP in conjunction with the municipalities. To&#13;
optimize potential benefits of lower overheads and common maintenance facilities, there is a strong view&#13;
within the sector that water and sewerage services should be administered by a single agency. This view&#13;
has considerable merit and will be addressed in the context of a water and sewerage master plan to be&#13;
financed under the Project.&#13;
1.12         Water Service Levels. In large urban areas, more than 95 percent of all households and&#13;
industrial users are directly connected to the public water supply system. However, in the allocation of&#13;
piped water between domestic and industrial consumers, industry has historically received priority&#13;
according to planned quotas determined by the type of product and capacity of each individual factory.&#13;
Even in times of acute water shortages, priority has gone to serving the needs of industry first. Domestic&#13;
water rationing, therefore, has always been the norm. Recently the problem has been amplified, mostly&#13;
because of a marked physical deterioration in the systems. In the larger urban areas, many households&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
are restricted to six hours or less of piped water per day.&#13;
1.13       To gain a better idea about the potential impact of water service levels on Baku residents,&#13;
IDA initiated and designed a household survey/social assessment in July 1994, which was carried out by&#13;
the Azerbaijan Institute of Social Management and Political Sciences in conjunction with the State&#13;
University of Baku. The major findings of the social assessment on service levels are summarized in para&#13;
2.13 and described more fully in Annex A.&#13;
1.14       The objectives of the social assessment were to identify key stakeholders and to propose an&#13;
appropriate framework for their participation in project design and implementation, to evaluate the social&#13;
impact of the proposed interventions on households and to investigate whether certain social groups may&#13;
be adversely affected, to design social mitigation measures for those who would experience negative&#13;
impacts if necessary, and to ensure that project objectives and incentives for change are appropriate and&#13;
acceptable to all beneficiaries. The social assessment consisted of a rapid household survey, undertaken&#13;
with the assistance of local academicians and researchers, community-based discussions conducted through&#13;
informal household visits and interviews, informal interviews with private sector providers of water, and&#13;
case studies of a small subset of households from the rapid appraisal sample.&#13;
1.15       Sewerage Service Levels. Sewerage service levels are even lower than those for water.&#13;
In the larger urban areas, one-third of the population is not connected to a municipal sewerage system.&#13;
In the case of adjacent towns and villages outside of Greater Baku but still within the Apsheron Peninsula,&#13;
none of the urban centers have proper sewerage systems and virtually none of these areas have treatment&#13;
facilities. In fact, sewage is usually discharged into the nearest lake or ground soakway. Existing&#13;
sewerage systems are in poor condition, leading to groundwater contamination and imminent risk of&#13;
polluting the water supply system through pipes built too closely together. The rising water level of&#13;
many of the natural lakes on the Peninsula is attributed to wastewater discharge. In the smaller urban&#13;
and rural areas the situation is even more precarious.&#13;
1.16       Constraints to Water Sector Development. Three major constraints have been identified&#13;
that significantly impede the development of the sector, notably: (i) the lack of finance for maintenance,&#13;
rehabilitation, and, in the longer term, new investment; (ii) the lack of a proper policy and analytical&#13;
framework; and (iii) a non-comrnercial approach to pricing:&#13;
(a)   Lack of Finance. The planning and budgetary process followed by the Government&#13;
generally, and by the Baku Water Agency (BWA) in particular, does not appear to be&#13;
sufficiently analytical to help policymakers make the proper determinations that will&#13;
facilitate overall sectoral efficiency.  The sector's budgetary process and the related&#13;
mechanisms of fiscal management have been described as a chronic shortage of funds&#13;
coupled with a continuous search for an appropriate balance between competing needs.&#13;
Thus, the recent economic uncertainties, which have been exacerbated by the Nagomo-&#13;
Karabakh conflict, and the demand for scarce resources from other sectors, will continue&#13;
to impose difficulties for the water and sewerage sector in obtaining the resources it needs;&#13;
(b)   Lack of Policy and Analytical Framework. While the jurisdictional fragmentation of the&#13;
sector is well known and in many respects a holdover from the previous era, it will,&#13;
nevertheless, require immediate attention if progress is to be made in streamlining the&#13;
sector. Further, under present arrangements, individual projects are formulated by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
sectoral agency, and the task of producing detailed designs is assigned to state-owned&#13;
engineering institutes. In the analysis of projects, technical feasibility and compatibility&#13;
with narrow sectoral objectives appear to be the main emphasis, rather than the economic&#13;
analysis that would help policymakers make well-informed decisions. While a master plan&#13;
to be prepared under the Project is expected to provide some of the answers, it is important&#13;
to emphasize that for a metropolitan region the size and complexity of Greater Baku, the&#13;
master plan at best can only be a rough, although strategic guide to investment choices; and&#13;
(c)   Pricing. Pricing is a serious issue. Tariffs and charges bear little relation to production&#13;
and operating costs and sewerage services are provided free. The current low tariff levels&#13;
represent a major constraint in generating the resources needed to finance a program of&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance. Arguably, some of the water "shortages" may well be&#13;
manifestations of underpricing, despite a consumer willingness to pay at a level that covers&#13;
the cost of provision. Bank/IDA experience has shown, for example, that the price charged&#13;
for water and sewerage services signals to the consumer its value--excessively low prices&#13;
often encourage the consumer to use more than is economically justified. Excessive use of&#13;
water in Baku is illustrated by the large number of constantly leaking faucets and faulty&#13;
sanitary fittings in many of the public buildings and private households.&#13;
1.17        Environmental Context. The Apsheron Peninsula is the site of one of the three most&#13;
industrialized regions in the FSU. Its ecosystem is replete with the residue and legacy of nearly a century&#13;
of environmental neglect. Importantly, this area is one of the oldest oil-producing regions in the world.&#13;
As a consequence of oil exploitation, as well as intense industrialization under the Soviets, the surface&#13;
and underground hydrosphere has caused 7,000 ha. of land to be polluted, with a thickness varying from&#13;
2.5 to 20 meters. This in turn has led to both flowage and underflooding, created bogs, increased&#13;
abrasion processes, polluted the Bay of Baku (with environmental imnpact on those who live near the Bay&#13;
or walk along its perimeter), and engendered serious pollution of the Caspian Sea--the level of which&#13;
is rising. A further problem pertains to the health care institutions themselves, which discharge biological&#13;
contaminants directly into the wastewater system. In addition, none of the 92 hospitals and 11 medical&#13;
institutes in the Baku area is equipped with adequate facilities for treating wastes before discharging them&#13;
into the municipal network (see IBRD Map No. 26889).&#13;
1.18        In the water sector, industrial contamination, generally inadequate water treatment, and&#13;
unreliable water supply and distribution pose serious social, health, and even industrial problems. Most&#13;
of the groundwater resources are contaminated by industrial and municipal wastes dumped or discharged&#13;
haphazardly (see IBRD Map No. 26891). The main source of pollution in the water distribution network&#13;
is the inflow of dirty groundwater that accumulates as a result of burst water and sewerage pipes which&#13;
the water company lacks the means to repair (to be addressed under the Project.)&#13;
1.19        Finally, there is a notable absence of realistic environmental standards and enforcement&#13;
mechanisms--although the Soviets developed rigorous guidelines, evidence suggests they were seldom&#13;
applied. Over time several industries developed their own environmental bureaus which theoretically&#13;
monitored environmnental impact; however, clearly self-policing has never worked. The result is a&#13;
widespread lack of coordination of environmental policies and standards.&#13;
1.20        There are four agencies involved in environmental monitoring and 200 monitoring sites,&#13;
including monitoring of marine ecosystems, freshwater, groundwater, and atmospheric pollution. In the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
current austere economic climate, lack of resources has seriously jeopardized all such activities, including&#13;
research. Recently, the State Ecological Committee drafted a package of environmental legislation that&#13;
incorporates international experience and concerns in the areas where monitoring takes place. This&#13;
legislation was submitted for parliamentary action in the spring of 1994 and is still pending.&#13;
Additionally, the National Sanitary Board, in cooperation with the Ecological Commission, has prepared&#13;
a manual that would establish national enviromnental standards which also awaits parliamentary approval.&#13;
D. Government Strategy and Bank/IDA Role&#13;
1.21       As part of the country's medium-term development program, Government strategy now&#13;
places high priority on developing the country's natural resources, especially in the petroleum and&#13;
agricultural sectors; channelling increased revenues toward expenditures and investments that will best&#13;
contribute to a sustainable and broad-based development; strengthening its transition to a market economy&#13;
with modern institutions and a flourishing private sector; and providing adequate infrastructure. The&#13;
Government has held discussions with the IMF on implementing an economic stabilization program, and&#13;
is seeking assistance from the IMF's Systemic Transformation Facility (STF). It has also requested that&#13;
the Bank support its efforts with a Rehabilitation Credit, which will be considered in the framework of&#13;
the Government reaching an understanding with the IMF on the STF program, and with the Bank on a&#13;
credible program of structural reforms.&#13;
1.22       The Bank/IDA assistance strategy aims to support Azerbaijan in its transition to a market&#13;
economy through policy advice, economic and sector work, and lending for investments and technical&#13;
assistance (TA). A limited Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has been developed. The Bank's main&#13;
focus includes support for economic transformation through assistance for institutional strengthening and&#13;
related financial support to the economy. At the sectoral level, Bank/IDA expects to focus on projects&#13;
in the energy, agricultural and social infrastructure sectors. An essential element of the Bank/IDA initial&#13;
assistance strategy is helping prepare the social safety net for the massive restructuring of the productive&#13;
sector that lies ahead. Bank/IDA is planning to develop two or three projects per year over fiscal years&#13;
1995-97. The amount of annual lending will depend on the pace of reform and resolution of critical&#13;
external factors, including the regional conflict with Armenia. Azerbaijan became eligible for IDA&#13;
assistance in December 1994, and the first two projects in the country will be on IDA terms.&#13;
1.23       The Greater Baku Water Supply Rehabilitation Project, which will be the Bank's first&#13;
infrastructure operation in Azerbaijan, is a critical component in strengthening the Social Safety net. The&#13;
Project has a strong poverty focus, as it will assist the poorer sections of to gain improved access to an&#13;
essential service. In addition to serving the residential population, the Project also benefits the productive&#13;
sectors by increasing the availability of a reliable and sustainable supply of potable water. The Project&#13;
has been designed with clear and simple objectives to facilitate implementation and have a high chance&#13;
of achieving its development impact quickly. Specifically, the Project would support the transition&#13;
process through key policy reforms and adjustment measures in the water sector. These include&#13;
strengthening cost recovery principles, pursuit of sound financing mechanisms (including financial&#13;
resource mobilization), and fostering the development of a strong institutional framework to contribute&#13;
effectively to the country's overall development process. This strategy aims also at institutionalizing a&#13;
rational decision-making process for new investments in the water and sewerage sector. In the absence&#13;
of IDA involvement, it is unlikely that the Government would be able to mobilize the financial resources&#13;
required to implement a water supply project for this economically and environmentally important area&#13;
of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
E. Bank/IDA Experience in the Sector&#13;
1.24       Bank/IDA  project experience in Azerbaijan is limited to implementation of Project&#13;
Preparation Facilities (PPF). This indicates that institutional capacity for implementation is limited, and&#13;
that responsibilities are often not well delineated between Government and enterprises. Close attention&#13;
will needed to be paid to procurement, due in part to the lack of familiarity with Bank procedures.&#13;
Further, the practical aspects of implementation, such as international communications and language&#13;
difficulties, can create delays.&#13;
1.25        The Project design, therefore, has relied on the extensive experience of Bank/IDA in the&#13;
sector. As of December 31, 1993, Bank lending to the water supply and sewerage sector totalled US$11&#13;
billion, funding 277 projects. While most of these projects were successful in achieving their physical&#13;
objectives and in achieving least cost solutions, there has been limited success in achieving strong and&#13;
financially viable institutions and poverty relief. In the few cases where physical objectives were not met,&#13;
the principal cause was cost overruns that resulted in some project components being dropped--mainly&#13;
those dealing with sanitation and pollution control initiatives. It is noteworthy that cost overruns were&#13;
seldom caused by poor cost estimating, but rather the consequence of inflation and delays in construction.&#13;
1.26        Bank experience also has shown that achieving institutioral and financial viability through&#13;
project design has proved elusive. In general, measurable success has been achieved only in projects that&#13;
enjoyed the full commitment of the borrower and substantial resources for training and technical&#13;
assistance. A recent World Bank study, which examined more than 120 urban water projects between&#13;
1967 and 1989, has concluded that despite efforts at capacity building for the public institutions&#13;
concerned, only four countries--Botswana, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Tunisia--have achieved&#13;
acceptable levels of performance for public water and sewerage utilities. The same report found that the&#13;
financial performance of water and sewerage agencies was equally poor. Some of the reasons for the less&#13;
than optimal results, which were also confirmed in the 1994 World Development Report (WDR), include:&#13;
(i) lack of clear sector policies; (ii) lack of management and financial autonomy; (iii) staff inexperience&#13;
in project implementation; and (iv) lack of participation by users and other stakeholders in the decision-&#13;
making process. Few Bank/IDA projects were able to demonstrate measurable success in meeting the&#13;
needs of the poor. This does not necessarily mean that the projects were unsuccessful, since a major&#13;
constraint in measuring poverty reduction was the lack of detailed data on the number of poor households&#13;
and their location, and when success was achieved, the lack of an empirical basis for measuring it.&#13;
1.27        In any event, the lessons are clear. From a demand perspective, the message is that the&#13;
various stakeholders must be trusted to choose from a menu of service levels that they want and are&#13;
willing to pay for. From a supply perspective, the lesson is that rigorous attention must be paid to water&#13;
conservation and system optimization, so that households can be provided with a particular level of&#13;
service at the lowest possible cost. These lessons, to the extent feasible, have been incorporated into the&#13;
design of the Project in four specific ways:&#13;
(a)   the IDA initiated social assessment was a first step towards generating informed public&#13;
participation in the design of the Project. The study also demonstrated a clear willingness&#13;
on the part of the consumer to pay for improved water supply. As a consequence of the&#13;
assessment, a larger Government constituency is evolving in support of policy and pricing&#13;
reforms. The question now, therefore, is not what should be done, but rather the conditions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
and timing under which reforms might be successfully implemented;&#13;
(b)   care has been taken to elicit strong support for the Project at both the Government and&#13;
implementing agency level;&#13;
(c)  special emphasis has been given to increasing public awareness on the merits of water&#13;
conservation and environmental protection and to optimizing existing water production&#13;
capacity (no new investments for capacity increases are proposed under the Project); and&#13;
(d)  substantial amounts of training and technical assistance have been incorporated into the&#13;
Project to support initiatives aimed at streamlining the sector, restructuring the existing&#13;
water supply administration, and providing both operational and administrative training&#13;
opportunities geared to improve service delivery, clarify lines of authority, and set&#13;
appropriate pricing policies.&#13;
II. PROJECT SETTING AND REFORM STRATEGY&#13;
A. Project Setting&#13;
2.1        Sources of Water. The Greater Baku system obtains water from three separate sources (see&#13;
IBRD Map No. 26892): (i) Shollar and Hachmas Groundwater Aquifers; (ii) Jeiranbatan Reservoir; and&#13;
(iii) the Kura River. These sources represent exploitation of both surface and underground resources.&#13;
The Shollar and Hachmas extraction facilities, generally known as Baku I and Baku 2, respectively, were&#13;
constructed in 1917 and were the first sources to be developed to serve Baku. Located about 185 kms&#13;
to the northwest of the city, these sources exploit an aquifer flowing under artesian conditions.&#13;
2.2         The Jeiranbatan Reservoir is fed with water by canal from the Samnur River located about&#13;
200 km north of Baku on the Russian border. The reservoir has a storage capacity of about 186 million&#13;
m3 (150 million in3 net) and is recharged at the rate of about 25 m3/s, of which 15 m3/s is earmarked for&#13;
irrigation purposes. The most significant beneficial feature of the reservoir is that it acts as a long-&#13;
retention presettlement pond, thus greatly enhancing the final quality of the treated water. However,&#13;
during the winter months the supply of water is affected by significant seasonal variations due to freezing&#13;
of the Samur River and the transmission canal. The Kura River originates in Georgia and flows through&#13;
Azerbaijan where it is joined by the Araks River (which originates from tributaries in Iran and Armenia)&#13;
en route to the Caspian Sea. Both rivers are reputed to be heavily polluted2 and turbidity levels are high,&#13;
especially during the spring run-off.&#13;
2.3        The Kura, Araks and Samur Rivers are international waterways within the meaning of the&#13;
World Bank's Operational Directive (OD) 7.50. However, the Project is exempt from the notification&#13;
requirement pursuant to OD 7.50 for the following reasons: (i) the Project will finance only rehabilitation&#13;
2 Data available from the former USSR Ministry of Health indicate that ammonia nitrates are 2 to 3 times&#13;
higher, refinery waste products 8 times higher, copper and zinc 10 times higher, and phenol 20 times higher than&#13;
former USSR norms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
and upgrading of existing systems; (ii) the rehabilitation activities will have no adverse affect on the&#13;
quantity or quality of water flows to or from any other riparian country; (iii) there is no indication that&#13;
the Project would be appreciable harmed by other riparians possible use of water and (iv) there have been&#13;
no findings to suggest that any international agreements exist between Azerbaijan and other riparians on&#13;
the sharing of international waters that mnight be affected by this Project.&#13;
2.4        Water Treatment Facilities. Ground water originating from the Shollar and Hachmas&#13;
Aquifers is of potable quality and treatment is not required. The combined production of these sources&#13;
is about 4.0 m3/s, of which about 1.5 m3/s is used by the towns and villages along the way. The water&#13;
flows by gravity to within 40 km of Baku before pumping is necessary.&#13;
2.5        The Jeiranbatan Treatment Works are located adjacent to the Jeiranbatan Reservoir. The&#13;
yield from the reservoir for domestic water supply is about 10 m3/s. Constructed in various stages from&#13;
1961 to 1978, the treatment works are of traditional design and use a mixture of horizontal and upward&#13;
flow settlement basins followed by rapid sand filters. Chlorination is provided at both inlet and outlet.&#13;
Although still functioning, the treatment works are in need of urgent rehabilitation.&#13;
2.6        The Kura River Treatment Works, which are located about 140 km to the south of Baku at&#13;
a point 45 km downstream from the confluence of the Kura and Araks Rivers, were constructed in two&#13;
stages between 1971 and 1988. It is noteworthy that the treatment works are provided with presettlement&#13;
tanks of unusual design based on radial flows and using polychromide as a coagulant. This unusual&#13;
design, together with shortages of the coagulant, are creating conditions whereby suspended solids are&#13;
not being sufficiently removed prior to conventional treatment. Under heavy sediment loads3 carried by&#13;
the river, the conventional horizontal tanks and rapid gravity filters become overwhelmed, leading to&#13;
inefficient chlorination and substandard water quality. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a start&#13;
was made on constructing presettlement lagoons covering an area of almost 170 ha; however, due to lack&#13;
of funds, these facilities have yet to be completed.&#13;
2.7        When operating at full capacity, the Jeiranbatan and Kura River Treatment Works can&#13;
supply up to 20 m3/s of potable water.&#13;
2.8         Pumping Stations and Transmission Mains.  All water from either the sources or&#13;
treatment works must be pumped at some stage. There are 13 pumping station sites (see IBRD Map No.&#13;
26890), some with more than one pumping station and all with more than one combination of pumps.&#13;
Most of the pumps and equipment are in very poor condition, so that equipment failure and service&#13;
interruptions are common. Further, the stations comprise a number of incompatible combinations of&#13;
pumps and motors, thus greatly reducing the overall efficiency of the system. In addition, most of the&#13;
pumping stations lack operating and maintenance manuals; operators often are not familiar even with the&#13;
basic instructions developed when the equipment was originally installed. Further, in most stations the&#13;
pumps and motors are mounted on separate foundation blocks, making proper alignment of the pump and&#13;
motor shafts almost impossible, thus resulting in excessive wear and frequent breakdowns. At prcsent,&#13;
motor failure is reported to be the largest single cause of service interruptions. The electrical stepdown&#13;
stations and transformers supplying power to the pumping stations are in equally poor condition.&#13;
I At point of intake, the Kura River averages a sedimentation level of 300 mg/l, but often reaches 1200 mg/l&#13;
and occasionally 6,000 mg/I.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.9        The main transmission pipelines, while in generally good condition, are large-diameter,&#13;
unprotected steel pipe varying in size from 900 mm to 1,400 mm. Eventually, these pipes should be&#13;
protected with a corrosive resistant material. There are over 500 km of 1,400 mm mains and 300 kmn&#13;
of 1,200 mm mains.&#13;
2.10       Distribution Network. There are over 2,500 km of distribution pipes in Baku (see IBRD&#13;
Map No. 26893), mostly of unprotected steel. Generally, the pipes are badly corroded and in poor&#13;
structural condition. In 1993, for example, BWA records indicate that almost 3,500 bursts and leaks&#13;
were attended to. Because residential housing in Baku mostly consists of high-rise apartment buildings&#13;
that lack roof storage for water, local boosting is a requirement. The BWA has 261 such booster pumps,&#13;
most of which are also in very poor condition. A random sample in two districts during the 10-month&#13;
period from January to October 1994 showed that 65 booster pumps required 378 maintenance and/or&#13;
repair visits. The poor condition of the booster pumps has meant that most residents living above the&#13;
third floor must carry water from a standpipe on the ground floor to their apartments. On-site inspection&#13;
suggests that leakage and waste within the system is also high; however, due to the absence of meters or&#13;
other measuring devices, the amount cannot be determined with precision.&#13;
2.11       Storage Capacity. The total water storage capacity for the Baku system is about 850,000&#13;
m3 or about 21 hours of estimated daily demand. In theory, capacity of this magnitude would normally&#13;
be sufficient for diurnal and seasonal balancing of emergencies. However, some of the reservoirs are&#13;
known to leak badly and the majority have not been cleaned for a number of years. Moreover, a&#13;
considerable amount of sediment has accumulated in many of the reservoirs. This is suspected of being&#13;
the major reason why recent water samples taken from the reservoirs show evidence of bacteriological&#13;
and fecal contamination. In addition to the main service reservoirs, there are many smaller reservoirs&#13;
owned and operated by district housing authorities. These reservoirs are outside the control of the BWA&#13;
but are also known to leak and many have continuously running overflows.&#13;
2.12       Service Levels. About 95 percent of all households in Greater Baku are connected to the&#13;
system. Water connections within Baku total about 42,000, of which 41,000 are domestic subscribers&#13;
and just under 1,000 industrial. However, it is widely known that there also many illegal connections.&#13;
About 10,000 meters have been installed over the years but fewer than 400 work.&#13;
2.13       Thus, while nearly all of Baku's households are considered officially connected to the public&#13;
water supply system, on average water is available to individual families for only 22 days per month for&#13;
a maximum of 11 hours per day. The July 1994 Social Assessment revealed the following insights on&#13;
consumer "coping" strategies engendered by the low service levels:&#13;
(a)   virtually 100 percent of the households in all neighborhoods and income groups suffer from&#13;
unreliable, intermittent, and insufficient water service, while 87 percent of all households&#13;
believe the public water is unsafe to drink;&#13;
(b)   peripheral communities and infornal settlements that encroach on former industrial sites are&#13;
particularly disadvantaged with regard to public water supply--these peripheral settlements&#13;
also contain the largest proportion of low-income groups;&#13;
(c)   women, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes appear to bear the greatest burden of the&#13;
water supply crisis;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(d)   an estimated 40 to 60 percent of water billings are not collected because local officials are&#13;
reluctant to enforce payment in light of current service levels and the suspect quality of the&#13;
water;&#13;
(e)   most households have developed alternative water supply strategies to cope with the&#13;
insufficient and irregular supply of public water, including boiling tap water (75 percent),&#13;
installing storage tanks (53 percent), drilling private wells (23 percent), and buying water&#13;
from vendors (20 percent); and&#13;
(f)   households spend about 17 times more on alternative water supplies than on their monthly&#13;
water bills--the poor spend a significantly higher proportion of their income (7 percent) than&#13;
the wealthy (2 percent). In financial terms, therefore, the poor would benefit most from&#13;
an improved supply system. However, in terms of improved water quality, both low-and&#13;
high-income families would benefit in about equal proportions.&#13;
2.14        Unaccounted For Water. Because master flow meters have never been installed at any of&#13;
the treatment facilities or pumping stations, nor have individual water meters been installed at the&#13;
household level, the total production and consumption capacity of the Baku system cannot be accurately&#13;
measured. Water production data, therefore, are computed in a general approximation based on the rated&#13;
capacity of the pumps and the number of hours per day that each pumnp is in operation. This crude&#13;
measure indicates a total daily production capacity of about 23m3/s or 2 million m3/day. Meaningful&#13;
consumption levels are impossible to determine. Assuming a total population of about 2.3 million&#13;
consumers, overall per capita water production totals about 800 liters per person per day (lcd), which is&#13;
extremely high even for industrialized cities in Europe or North America4.&#13;
Table 2.1: Per Capita Production Capacity&#13;
1995     2000    2005    2010       2015&#13;
Population Served (OOOs)           2,338   2,239    2,473    2,650       2,822&#13;

Total Production Requirements (lcd)    862   526      551      542        536&#13;
2.15       Against this backdrop, data provided by the BWA suggest that unaccounted for water is&#13;
extraordinarily high and varies between 65 percent and 70 percent of production. These figures&#13;
underscore the urgent need to reduce wastage in the system as quickly as possible and suggests that major&#13;
investments in system expansion should be delayed until the existing system is brought to order. For&#13;
example, Table 2.1 below shows the impact on water production requirements if leakage and waste of&#13;
water could be restricted to about 45 percent of production by the end of the decade and to 30 percent&#13;
of production by the year 2,015--additional capacity would not be required for at least 20 years and&#13;
possibly longer based on current population estimates.&#13;
I In highly industrialized cities such as Philadelphia, Rome, and San Francisco, consumption levels range&#13;
between 600-700 lcd; in major cities with industry or areas with liberal supplies such as London, Glasgow,&#13;
Marseilles, Turin, Sydney and Antwerp, the range is between 400-500 lcd; in cities with temperate climates such&#13;
as Liverpool, Bologna, Frankfurt, and Stockholm, it is between 300-350 lcd.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.16       The condition of water pipes within public and private buildings is poor as is the condition&#13;
of the service connections and meters. Because billing is based on a flat rate computed on the number&#13;
of occupants per household, there is no pricing incentive to conserve water or repair leaks. Apart from&#13;
the losses attributed to leaks and bursts in the network and from overflowing local reservoirs, BWA data&#13;
suggest that the amount lost from sanitary fittings within households is equivalent to about 10 percent of&#13;
production. Therefore, a consumer education and water conservation program has been included in the&#13;
Project to address this issue. In most cases, the wastewater plumbing appears to be adequate and will&#13;
not be addressed under the Project.&#13;
2.17       The Baku Water Agency (BWA). The BWA employs a total staff of about 3,600 people&#13;
and is divided into two sub-units: (i) BWA, itself, which is responsible for producing the water and&#13;
selling it on a wholesale basis to the towns and villages along the transmission pipelines; and (ii) its&#13;
subsidiary, the Baku Water Department (BWD), which is responsible for water distribution within the&#13;
city of Baku, including the operation and maintenance of the Baku system. BWA employs a staff of&#13;
about 2,400 people and is divided into three functional departments: (i) Technical and Engineering; (ii)&#13;
Construction and Vehicle Transport; and (iii) Water Production Facilities.&#13;
2.18       BWD employs a staff of about 1,200 people and is divided into similar departments. In&#13;
addition, BWD operates through nine district headquarters, each with a full staff complement including&#13;
a manager, two senior supervisory engineers, a personnel officer, payroll clerk, cashier, technical teams&#13;
of three to four people, and field personnel at pumping stations and workshops (often nearly one-third&#13;
of total staff). The lines of reporting are idiosyncratic, and hiring often mirrors social realities of the past&#13;
and present (pensioners comprise most of the laborers at the pumping stations and in the workshops, and&#13;
some returning veterans of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have been hired).&#13;
2.19        Five major institutional constraints have been identified that significantly impede the&#13;
effectiveness of BWA, notably (i) the corporate culture under which it must operate; (ii) the fragmentation&#13;
of its operations; (iii) major operational constraints; (iv) limited budgeting and planning capacity; and (v)&#13;
lack of transparency in the accounting and internal control system:&#13;
(a)   The Corporate Culture. BWA is a centrally managed government department with little&#13;
or no management and financial autonomy. Management is characterized by a top-down&#13;
style inherited from the previous Soviet system, with all decisions centrally controlled and&#13;
micromanagement pervasive. Clearly there is a need to implement fundamental changes in&#13;
the way the utility conducts its business;&#13;
(b)   Fragmentation of BWA Operations. The headquarters and key managers of BWA and its&#13;
subsidiary, BWD, are located in a small building in the central part of the city. On the&#13;
other hand, many of the key administrative and financial functions of these companies are&#13;
handled by offices scattered across metropolitan Baku, which is the consequence of the&#13;
corporate culture and inadequate space at the headquarters facility;&#13;
(c)   Major Operational Constraints. The general operating and maintenance standards of the&#13;
Baku system fall well below acceptable levels, partly because equipment, tools, and spare&#13;
parts are virtually unobtainable and partly because of the poor organizational and operating&#13;
methods that are currently in place.  Operationally, large water main bursts remain&#13;
unrepaired close to district headquarters (some of which are controlled by makeshift dikes),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
which underscores the inadequacy of the water company to address even the most obvious&#13;
leaks. There are also numerous and clearly visible illegal water connections into urban&#13;
communities, including near reservoirs in Greater Baku. This points to a severe lack of&#13;
institutional capacity and responsiveness at the most basic operational level. Clearly,&#13;
commercial operations are impossible under these chaotic circumstances;&#13;
(d)   Liniited Budgeting and Planning Capacity.  Generally, there is extremely limited&#13;
collection and reporting of information vital to the commercial management of the water&#13;
company. In addition planning is on an ad hoc basis, and authorities are instead forced to&#13;
spend much of their time responding to the latest crisis in the water supply and distribution&#13;
system; and&#13;
(e)   Lack of Transparency in the Accounting and Internal Control System. The accounting&#13;
system, to the extent it exists, is a cash based, double entry, manual system with even the&#13;
most basic management information difficult to obtain. There are no computing facilities&#13;
available and recorded information is paper-based with few proformas in use. Basic internal&#13;
control systems such as perpetual inventory records or monthly balancing of accounts&#13;
receivable ledgers to control accounts have never been installed. Further, fixed asset&#13;
registers do not exist, so that BWA is uncertain as to precisely what it owns. In spite of&#13;
the size and complexity of BWA, it has no internal audit section. While external&#13;
government inspectors undertake selective audits on an annual basis, these do not approach&#13;
the level of sophistication required for a commercial undertaking.&#13;
B. Reform Strategy&#13;
2.20        Rationale. The profile that emerges from the Baku water and sewerage sector comprises&#13;
a number of different agencies and ministries, often with overlapping or unclear lines of authority. Each&#13;
ministry has independently progressed into sectoral implementation tasks, thus impeding the efficient&#13;
development of multisector planning, programming and budgeting initiatives. The result has been a&#13;
piecemeal response to sectoral needs that has tended to focus on the installation of large-scale physical&#13;
infrastructure facilities. Because many of these facilities were not operationally integrated into a program&#13;
of asset maintenance and improvement at the planning and implementation stage, operating and&#13;
maintenance requirements have traditionally assumed a low priority in the national budgeting process.&#13;
Today, many of the infrastructure systems, especially the Greater Baku system, have regressed into a state&#13;
of systemic degradation, exhibiting the accumulated effect of decades of inadequate maintenance.&#13;
2.21        Nevertheless, over the last three decades, the Government has made substantial investments&#13;
in water infrastructure. However, the focus of this investment policy has been on the quantity of&#13;
investments. Improving the quality of investments is also vital. Further, while the BWA is a public&#13;
utility and should be perceived as a commercially oriented undertaking, it should be recognized that until&#13;
recently it has always operated at a loss, never generating sufficient funds to meet day-to-day expenses&#13;
nor to cover its working capital needs, or the contributions required to finance new works; the BWA&#13;
became accustomed to operating as a highly subsidized institution, and its management philosophy has&#13;
been deeply ingrained along these lines. This, coupled with the sectoral fragmentation at the national&#13;
level and low operating efficiencies at the sectoral level, have all played a part in reducing the impact of&#13;
the earlier investments and point to the need for a major reform initiative. Creating the institutional and&#13;
organizational conditions that oblige the water agency to be more efficient and more responsive to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
needs of users is clearly the major challenge of this Project. This challenge will be addressed through&#13;
a five-point intervention program: (i) creating a macro environment conducive to change; (ii) acquiring&#13;
adequate working facilities; (iii) creating an appropriate institutional framework; (iv) establishing the&#13;
internal capacity to manage reform; and (v) corporatizing the new agency.&#13;
2.22       Creating a Macro Environment Conducive to Reform.  It is envisaged that the&#13;
Government will have a continuing but changed role in the new water company--from that of a direct&#13;
provider of services to that of a regulator. In this connection, it is important that a policy and regulatory&#13;
framework be established at the national level that coordinates cross-sectoral interactions, including&#13;
private involvement in the provision of infrastructure, safeguards the interests of the low income groups,&#13;
and improves environmental safeguards. Consultants, in cooperation with the water company and&#13;
designated ministries, will carry out a study and prepare an Action Plan to define overall sector goals,&#13;
recommend policy changes, develop a regulatory framework, and propose a developmental strategy and&#13;
an action plan for implementing the strategy. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that the study&#13;
will be carried out by June 30, 1996 by consultants acceptable to IDA and that the results of the study&#13;
will be discussed with IDA and implemented by December 31, 1996.&#13;
2.23       Acquiring Adequate Working Facilities.  In the context of the reform strategy. the&#13;
Government has agreed that all departments and entities associated with the Greater Baku water sector,&#13;
now widely scattered throughout the city, will be consolidated in one location under one management&#13;
structure. To facilitate this process and expedite the internal restructuring initiative, a new building has&#13;
been acquired and will be refurbished to house the new fully integrated institution. This will make it&#13;
easier to create a management environment within which decisions can be taken regarding appropriate&#13;
staff skill mix, institutional capacity gaps that constrain meeting sector needs, establishment of training&#13;
programs and ways and means identified to implement them, and internal reorganization changes to bring&#13;
about a more efficient water authority, including pinpointing operational areas suitable for privatization.&#13;
2.24       Creating the Appropriate Institutional Framework. As the first step in the reforn&#13;
process, the Government has established the water utility as a legal entity subject to company law,&#13;
including formal separation of ownership and management responsibilities through a board of directors.&#13;
The company has its own contracting and salary regime. The new company has been named the&#13;
Apsheron Regional Water Company (ARWC) because its service area generally comprises most of the&#13;
Apsheron Peninsula. In its earlier years the company will be initially owned by the Government, but as&#13;
the reform process becomes more firmly established, the company ultimately may be privatized through&#13;
public stock offerings. Initially, it is envisaged that the new company will be controlled through a severn&#13;
person Board of Directors comprising the Minister of Economy; Minister of Finance; Minister of Housing&#13;
and Communal Property; Mayor of Baku; Managing Director of the Company; and two members of the&#13;
private sector. The provisional organizational structure of the ARWC is shown in Annex B while the&#13;
corporate charter is shown in Annex C.&#13;
2.25       Establishing the Internal Capability to Manage Reform. In order to: (ii) facilitate the&#13;
transition of the BWA from a Government department to a joint stock company; (ii) integrate the&#13;
previously fragmented activities of the BWA into the ARWC; (iii) develop and implement the internal&#13;
operating systems for the ARWC; and (iv) manage all aspects of Project implementation, a Corporate&#13;
Development Unit (CDU) has been established in the ARWC. The CDU, in effect, will become the&#13;
nerve center of the corporatization process and will be assisted in its activities through a corporate&#13;
development arrangement with a qualified water agency acceptable to IDA from Europe, Asia, or North&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
America. Previous experience has shown that such an arrangement can be helpful in assisting a CDU&#13;
in introducing new mechanisms, in mobilizing reform constituencies, and in developing a strong&#13;
counterpart to speak for the enterprise in executive and legislative debates. The Terms of Reference for&#13;
the corporate partnership arrangement are contained in Annex D. Because of the importance of the&#13;
corporate partner, its selection is a condition of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
2.26       Corporatization of the ARWC. Responsibility for the corporatization of the ARWC will&#13;
rest with the CDU which will prepare an overall corporate restructuring plan. After review and approval&#13;
by IDA, the restructuring plan will be implemented by consultants acceptable to IDA. The plan will&#13;
include explicit performance objectives and well-defined budgets. As an important tool in this process,&#13;
a management information system linked with both operational budget planning and strategic planning&#13;
will be installed and will include, inter alia, a general ledger module with provision for departmental&#13;
accounting; an automated, fixed-asset module to provide all pertinent information on depreciation and an&#13;
easily retrievable means of handling revaluations; a general accounts receivable module for fully&#13;
automating the billing and collection process; a payroll module for processing salaries and wages with&#13;
provision for receiving data from timekeeping and job cost-modules; and a cost accounting module to&#13;
separately account for wages, materials, etc. in the central and district workshops, as well as in the&#13;
treatment facilities and major pumping stations. A description of the Corporate Restructuring Plan,&#13;
including the training components, is contained in Annex E. Agreement was obtained during negotiations&#13;
that the corporate restructuring plan will be prepared by December 31, 1995 and implemented by&#13;
December 31, 1996.&#13;
2.27       The corporate restructuring plan will place special emphasis on improving the maintenance&#13;
capability of ARWC. The existing entity currently operates a passive leakage control policy, in that leaks&#13;
are repaired only when they are visible above the ground. This was appropriate in view of the shortage&#13;
of materials for repairs and the high losses caused by burst mains and customer plumbing systems.&#13;
However, as the system is renewed and pressures increase, the incidence of pipe failure will likely&#13;
increase, thus escalating the need for efficient and responsive operational control.  Training will&#13;
undoubtedly need to take place and be sustained to ensure the quality of the repairs made. It is important,&#13;
therefore, that a leakage inspection repair team be set up and properly equipped to travel the routes of&#13;
trunk mains so that leaks may be promptly repaired. This effort will be targeted at those trunk and&#13;
transmission mains which are shown by measurement to have high losses. Agreement was obtained&#13;
during negotiations that such teams will be in place by December 31, 1995;&#13;
2.28       At present, public perception of the service provided by BWA is negative. The future&#13;
success of ARWC is largely contingent on successfully soliciting consumer cooperation. To ensure&#13;
proper implementation of this part of the restructuring plan, it will be necessary for the ARWC to recruit&#13;
a public information officer with a small department to develop and deliver a proactive public relations&#13;
strategy aimed at reversing the image of the agency and explaining its current and future plans and the&#13;
important role it plays in respect to the quality of life in the city. Agreement was obtained during&#13;
negotiations that such an individual will be appointed by September 30, 1995.&#13;
2.29       The present personnel function deals principally with personnel records and recruitment.&#13;
Little or no emphasis has been placed on staff demands, personal development, industrial relations and&#13;
structured training programs.  In fact, over the past several years staff training initiatives have&#13;
experienced a steady decline. To ensure the success of this part of the restructuring plan, therefore, it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
will be necessary for the ARWC to recruit a qualified human resource and training coordinator to&#13;
rationalize personnel services and develop and deliver training programs aimed at both operational and&#13;
administrative personnel. Moreover, there will be a need to consolidate human resource functions within&#13;
the new corporate structure along with the training function. Agreement was obtained during negotiations&#13;
that such an individual will be appointed by September 30, 1995.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin and Formulation&#13;
3.1        Background. The Project will be the first Bank/IDA infrastructure investment operation&#13;
in Azerbaijan. During the reconnaissance mission in January 1994, Bank/IDA was asked to consider&#13;
making a sizeable credit to the Government to address the major problems associated with the water and&#13;
sewerage sector in Greater Baku. It was concluded, however, that: (i) the cost of such a program would&#13;
exceed all available resources for a single lending operation; and (ii) the current weak performance&#13;
capacity of the designated institutions, including poor maintenance practices and low tariff levels, would&#13;
preclude consideration of such an operation without substantial upfront institutional restructuring and&#13;
financial reforms. It was agreed, therefore, that a longer-term development program divided into two&#13;
or more phases would be the preferred strategic approach.&#13;
3.2        Current Phase.  In this nexus of service requirements and financial constraints, an&#13;
improved formal water supply service was clearly the first priority of Govermment in this sector. The&#13;
1994 reconnaissance mission concurred with this assessment. It was agreed with the Government that&#13;
the first phase, which is covered by the proposed Project, will focus on addressing the widespread&#13;
inefficiencies in the production and distribution of potable water through a major institutional reform&#13;
initiative (paras 2.20-2.29). It was also agreed that, in terms of physical works, the first phase would&#13;
be limited in scope and would comprise a five-year "time-slice" of the most urgent priority works that&#13;
would have an immediate and demonstrable impact on improving the reliability and quality of water&#13;
supply to domestic consumers and hence on the general living standards of the population. Such works&#13;
would be characterized by relatively low costs and high benefits. Given the need to complete the&#13;
sewerage master plan and the limited resources either at the Government level or with potential funding&#13;
agencies, it was agreed to defer any sewerage investments to a second phase program.&#13;
3.3        Subsequent Phases. The Government recognizes that full rehabilitation of the Baku system&#13;
will be a long and costly process. Second and subsequent Phases, therefore, will be aimed at water and&#13;
sewerage network rehabilitation and possible expansion to existing capacity. It is noteworthy that the&#13;
aggregate cost of dealing in a comprehensive way with the water and sewerage sector in Greater Baku&#13;
is expected to be large. Rehabilitation of the water network alone will probably exceed US$300 million.&#13;
Similarly, the collection and treatment of sewage is very expensive. Typical investment costs for&#13;
collecting sewage from a household are approximately US$1,000. Treatment costs increase this amount&#13;
to nearly US$1,500 for primary treatment alone. If these figures are applied to Greater Baku, this&#13;
translates into a potential investment requirement of about US$600 million. For higher levels of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
treatment, as now mandated by many industrial countries, costs are much higher'. Compounding this&#13;
already formidable challenge is that sewerage services in Greater Baku are being managed with even less&#13;
efficiency than water services. It was agreed, therefore, that additional investments in the water and&#13;
sewerage sector should be preceded by the preparation of a regional water and sewerage master plan.&#13;
Typically, such a plan would take from one to two years to complete.&#13;
B. Project Objectives and Description&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
3.4         The primary objectives of the Project are to: (a) make emergency short term improvements&#13;
in the water supply system to restore the water supply to Baku, in particular to the poorer elements of&#13;
the population; (b) improve the water supply system as a whole; and (c) provide the basis for longer term&#13;
planning and recovery. Although such a rehabilitation effort does not normally have extensive policy&#13;
conditionality, the Project will ensure that the BWA: (a) Apsheron Regional Water Company (ARWC)6,&#13;
successor to the BWA, becomes a market orientated joint stock company; (b) establishes a twinning&#13;
arrangement with a modern, market-oriented water agency from a developed country; and (c) consolidates&#13;
its operations under one management structure in one location. In addition, the cost recovery covenant&#13;
in the credit agreement will ensure that ARWC makes substantial progress towards financial soundness.&#13;
Given the existing situation, this represents an appropriate balance arnong the needs to: (a) restore the&#13;
water supply; (b) lay the basis for long-term sustainability; and (c) recognize the modest institutional&#13;
capacity from which ARWC is starting.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
3.5         The Project has been designed collaboratively with the direct participation of the European&#13;
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). To achieve its objectives, the Project comprises five&#13;
main components: (i) water demand management; (ii) operations and maintenance improvements; (iii)&#13;
supply improvements; (iv) institutional capacity building; and (v) studies.&#13;
3.6         Water Demand Management (US$6.7 million, or 7.1 percent of total project costs).&#13;
Losses and wastage at the household level are significant, mainly because of the lack of incentives and&#13;
the lack of awareness to conserve water. To address this problem, the component has been divided into&#13;
the following three sub-components:&#13;
(a)   Metering and Billing. As a first step in the process of optimizing water use, a metering&#13;
program will be implemented in conjunction with the revision of existing billing practices.&#13;
About 15,000 domestic water meters will be installed. At the same time, the billing system&#13;
5 To cite one example, it is estimated that the United Kingdom will have to invest about US$60 billion (about&#13;
0.6 percent of GDP) in wastewater treatment over the next decade just to meet the new European water quality&#13;
standards.&#13;
6 Because the BWA is a regional producer of bulk water for most of the towns and villages in the Apsheron&#13;
Peninsula as well as a retail distributor of water for Greater Baku, Government authorities decided to name the new&#13;
company commensurate with its geographic responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
will be gradually changed from flat rate billing to metered billing. Where only the&#13;
installation of a single building meter is possible, follow-up inspections by ARWC staff will&#13;
be implemented to check for adequate customer plumbing systems;&#13;
(b)   Consumer Education. The second step in the process comprises a consumer awareness&#13;
program aimed at providing very practical advice on how to reduce water losses and how&#13;
to optimize water use. The campaign will include television commercials, posters and the&#13;
use leaflets in selected areas where losses are known to be high, where pressures are high,&#13;
or where remedial works are proposed; and&#13;
(c)   Household Leakage. About half of the households in Baku have continuously leaking toilet&#13;
cisterns and current data indicate that these leaks comprise about 10 percent of the total&#13;
unaccounted for water. Renewing these valves is relatively inexpensive so that about&#13;
180,000 such units will be installed by independent contractors.&#13;
3.7        Operations and Maintenance Improvements (US$28.7 million, or 30.3 percent of total&#13;
project costs). There are about 3,500 main repairs per year in Baku. However, such repairs have little&#13;
impact due to the lack of proper equipment and materials. To improve the effectiveness of such main&#13;
repairs, the operations and maintenance capacity of the ARWC will be strengthened. This will be&#13;
achieved through the following two sub-components:&#13;
(a)   Vehicles, Workshops and Equipment. A number of crew vehicles, light vans, trucks and&#13;
other construction equipment will be acquired. Workshops will replaced or refurbished and&#13;
supplied with the requisite tools, equipment, and communications equipment, including&#13;
compressors, welding sets and portable pumps, etc. and&#13;
(b)   Materials. As the leak detection and repair program takes effect and the incidence of burst&#13;
pipes become more significant as a consequence of the increasing line pressure, the need&#13;
for a significant inventory of materials will increase. In order to accommodate this&#13;
requirement, at least a one-year supply of pipes, valves and fittings will be purchased.&#13;
3.8        Supply Improvements (US$39.5 million, or 41.7 percent of total project costs).&#13;
Improvements to the reliability and quality of water to the consumers require a sustained supply of water&#13;
from the treatment works to the final end-user. This will be achieved through the following three sub-&#13;
components:&#13;
(a)   Rehabilitation of Jeiranbatan and Kura River Treatment Facilities. The quality and quantity&#13;
of water from these facilities will be improved through a turnkey contract arrangement (see&#13;
para. 4.6) which consist of: renovating the chemical dousing and filtration systems,&#13;
refurbishing the presettlement tanks and the filter washwater systems, replacement and/or&#13;
rehabilitation of electrical transformers, high-lift pumping stations, switching gear, pumps,&#13;
and internal piping and filtration facilities;&#13;
(b)   Rehabilitation of Pumping Stations. The Baku service area has 13 major pumping stations&#13;
and 261 booster stations. Many of these pumps are 20 to 25 years old; the typical useful&#13;
life of pump sets of this type is generally 15 years. These facilities will be rehabilitated on&#13;
an as-needed basis with pump replacements/repair, rehabilitation of electrical transformers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
and replacement of internal piping; and&#13;
(c)   Master Meters. To accurately measure water production and to control and monitor system&#13;
performance, master flow and turbine insertion meters will be installed at each of the water&#13;
sources, major pumping stations, service reservoir discharge outlets, and at key points in&#13;
the distribution network.&#13;
3.9        Institutional Capacity Building (US$8.3 million, or 8.7 percent of total project costs).&#13;
The ARWC recognizes that technical improvements will not of themselves lead to an improved and&#13;
sustainable level of service to the consumers. The organization and management of the ARWC needs&#13;
to be restructured through a comprehensive reform strategy in a fashion consistent with the systems of&#13;
administration locally in force, but able to operate the water supply system in an efficient manner&#13;
providing acceptable minimum levels of service. This will be achieved through two sub-components:&#13;
(a)   Technical Assistance. A twinning arrangement with a modern water utility and related&#13;
training will provide the framework for the commercial operation of the newly corporatized&#13;
water company.  Specific programs also will be designed to assist ARWC in the&#13;
implementation of the consumer education program, the introduction of new technology into&#13;
ARWC, and the implementation of an Institutional Restructuring Plan aimed at reorganizing&#13;
and strengthening the management systems, especially accounting, billing and collection,&#13;
financial management, information management, and operations management. Similarly,&#13;
both formal and informal on-the-job training to all staff will be provided; and&#13;
(b)   Office Consolidation. The administrative offices of the ARWC are inadequate both in size&#13;
and configuration to carry out nornal administrative and management functions. The&#13;
Government has agreed to obtain an existing building of adequate size for the ARWC with&#13;
adjacent property that would be suitable for constructing future maintenance and stores&#13;
facilities. The newly acquired building would be remodelled, furnished, and equipped with&#13;
appropriate office equipment, including computers, photocopying machines, drafting tables&#13;
and the like.&#13;
3.10        Studies and Construction Supervision (US$6.3 million, or 6.6 percent of total project&#13;
costs). The preparation of a Phase 11 Project for Baku will be placed within the context of (i) the&#13;
preparation and implementation of a national policy framework; and (ii) the preparation a regional water&#13;
and sewerage master for the Apsheron Peninsula, which will address all current sector issues by taking&#13;
into account possible future developments and options by looking to a 20-year design horizon. The&#13;
essential elements of the master plan will include, inter alia:&#13;
(a)   an estimation of water and sewerage demand taking into account demographic changes, city&#13;
regeneration requirements, domestic and industrial location and relocation options, and&#13;
agricultural needs;&#13;
(b)   an evaluation of existing abstraction, treatment and distribution facilities, including field&#13;
measurements of water pressure, flows, storage and system efficiencies, leading to the&#13;
creation of a computer model to identify areas of inadequate supply or pressure;&#13;
(c)   an evaluation of various sewerage schemes, including technical and economic evaluation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
different development scenarios using different treatment levels; and&#13;
(d)   an assessment of pricing mechanisms and consumer ability to pay leading to proposals for&#13;
a self-financing operation for the maintenance of the water and sewerage network.&#13;
3.11        Interest During Construction. (US$4.4 million or 4.6 percent of total project costs).&#13;
3.12        Repayment of the PPF Advance. (US$1.0 million or 1.0 percent of total project costs).&#13;
C. Project Costs&#13;
3.13        The total cost of the Project, including an allowance for physical and price contingencies&#13;
of US$15.6 million, is estimated at US$94.9 million, of which about US$79.8 million or about 84 percent&#13;
represents the foreign exchange component. The cost estimates were prepared by consultants and revised&#13;
during appraisal based on final designs, equipment specifications, and a survey of construction costs&#13;
undertaken during project preparation. The estimated cost by component is summarized in Table 3.1&#13;
below, while detailed cost estimates are presented in Annex F. Base costs are expressed in January 1995&#13;
prices. Price contingencies have been calculated on the basis of a 2.5 percent annual international&#13;
inflation rate and a project implementation period of six years.&#13;

Status of Project Preparation&#13;
3.14        The Project has been prepared with the assistance of foreign consultants acceptable to IDA&#13;
and EBRD. The consultants completed a feasibility study and submitted their final report in January&#13;
1995. Final designs are expected to be completed in June 1995. Bidding documents for the procurement&#13;
of water meters, the repair of in-home plumbing fixtures, leak detection and repair, the purchase of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
maintenance equipment, the construction of maintenance garages, and the acquisition of at least a one year&#13;
supply of maintenance stores are now prepared. Bidding documentation for the remaining components&#13;
should be ready for bidding by July 1995. A project implementation schedule is contained in Annex G.&#13;
D. Project Financing&#13;
3.15         Extensive discussions have been held between IDA and EBRD concerning the financing&#13;
arrangements between the two institutions. The summary financing plan is presented in Table 3.2.&#13;

3.16       IDA Lending Arrangements. IDA will provide a credit of SDR 38.8 million (US$61&#13;
million equivalent) to the Republic of Azerbaijan at standard IDA terms with 35-years' maturity and 10&#13;
years of race. The IDA credit will be used to finance contracts procured in accordance with IDA&#13;
guidelines for the purchase of goods, works and consultant services.&#13;
3.17       EBRD Lending Arrangements. EBRD will make a loan of ECU 17 million (US$23&#13;
million equivalent) to the Republic of Azerbaijan at standard EBRD terms with a 3-year grace period and&#13;
a 15-year maturity at an interest rate of one percentage point over LIBOR. The loan will be used to&#13;
parallel finance the purchase of goods works and consultant services in accordance with EBRD&#13;
procurement guidelines. Satisfactory evidence that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the&#13;
EBRD loan have been fulfilled is a condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit.&#13;
3.18       Onlending Terms. The Government will on-lend the proceeds of the IDA Credit and&#13;
EBRD loan (US$84 million equivalent) to the ARWC under a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to&#13;
IDA and the EBRD. The subsidiary loan will carry repayment terms of 25 years with a 5-year grace&#13;
period at 7 percent interest. Signing of the subsidiary loan agreement is a condition of effectiveness of&#13;
the IDA Credit and the EBRD loan.&#13;
E. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.19       Environmental Impact. Preparation of the Project has included environmental studies&#13;
consistent with the applicable procedures of the Government of Azerbaijan and the provisions of World&#13;
Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment." In accordance with these procedures,&#13;
consultants have prepared an environmental analysis, complying with the requirements of a Category B&#13;
project (see Annex H). The Project is conceived as a package of urgent measures to restore order to the&#13;
water sector both institutionally and technically, along with identifying a menu of activities in a sector&#13;
master plan that ultimately will bring about the needed improvement in the quantity and quality of water&#13;
supplied to the Greater Baku area, thus leading to overall environmental improvement and increase in the&#13;
quality of life for all segments of the population.&#13;
3.20        Implementation of the Project will result in improvements to the quality of potable water&#13;
through reduction of potential cross-contamination from polluted soil and strengthen the capacity of&#13;
ARWC to monitor water quality and to develop and process reliable data that can be used to select&#13;
priority interventions. The Project will increase the volume of sewage discharged, although the total&#13;
solids and BOD loadings should increase only slightly especially if the Project's water conservation&#13;
strategy is successful. Resources are insufficient, however, to address the sewerage needs in the Project&#13;
area and the first priority and focus of the Project is to bring the water supply system to order. It is&#13;
envisaged that the next phase of investments will provide additional resources to improve the sewerage&#13;
collection systems in developed areas and to provide a minimum level of treatment, which would likely&#13;
comprise at least screening and grit removal. While only about 50 percent of the sewage is now treated,&#13;
the danger from hazardous wastes is not likely to increase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPERVISION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
4.1        Managing the Transitional Process and Implementing the Project. The implementing&#13;
agency for the Project will be the newly created Apsheron Regional Water Company (ARWC), successor&#13;
to the BWA. The ARWC has been established as a legally autonomous joint stock company with its own&#13;
contracting and salary regime. The sector reformn strategy and the ARWC corporatization process has&#13;
been outlined in paras 2.20-2.29. The technical capacity for institutional strengthening and Project&#13;
implementation will be established through a twinning arrangement between the ARWC and a modern&#13;
water utility acceptable to IDA. The need for a twinning arrangement is paramount, especially given&#13;
the demands associated with the transitional process in converting the former water utility into a new&#13;
institution based on international operational and administrative standards used by commercially viable&#13;
water companies.&#13;
4.2        To facilitate the corporatization process and to manage Project implementation, a Corporate&#13;
Development Unit (CDU) has been established within the ARWC. The CDU's principal activities have&#13;
been organized around ARWC's operational departments which, during the transitional period, will&#13;
parallel those of the BWA. The CDU will be staffed initially by five Azeri Nationals and five expatriates&#13;
provided by the corporate partner, each of whom will have appropriate experience in procurement and&#13;
construction management, water utility operations, treatment plant operations and finance and&#13;
administrative systems. While the CDU reports to the ARWC Managing Director (formerly head of the&#13;
BWA), day-to-day operations are the responsibility of a CDU Director. When operating at full capacity,&#13;
the CDU will have a staff of about 10-12 professionals and an equal number of paraprofessionals. The&#13;
corporate development partner is expected to remain an integral part of the CDU for about three to four&#13;
years, after which ARWC may decide to extend its services.&#13;
4.3        It is noteworthy that the twinning arrangement has been be tailored to generate institution-&#13;
building as an integral part of the deployment of the CDU, as well as direct involvement of those who&#13;
will become the future managers of the ARWC. At the same time, there is an immediate need for the&#13;
corporate partner to train the executive management of the former BWA (now the executive management&#13;
of the ARWC) in management techniques, especially those pertaining to organizational change and&#13;
transition management. This need is paramount, since the CDU and senior management will be those&#13;
charged with the responsibility to subsequently train selected managerial candidates to take over the&#13;
operations of key departments in the ARWC. Moreover, in line with the twinning exercise and the&#13;
training of executive managers, the human resource, technical, and managerial reforms contemplated over&#13;
the life of the project will be institutionalized with the direct assistance of the corporate partner. This&#13;
will involve training at all levels of personnel, both at headquarters and in field offices in a well&#13;
coordinated and targeted way.&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
4.4        The procurement of goods and works will be carried out by the CDU with the assistance&#13;
of the consultants for final designs, bid documentation preparation, and construction supervision services.&#13;
The consultants will also advise the CDU on contract administration and additional experts will be&#13;
brought in on an as-needed basis. Most of the contracts will be fully engineered prior to bidding and&#13;
award. The contracts will require close supervision to instruct the contractors on the work to be carried&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

out on a day to day basis and to measure the quantity of work accomplished for payment purposes.&#13;
Careful records will also be kept of the changes that will be made to the system for the updating of water&#13;
system maps. All IDA financing components, including consultants services will be procured according&#13;
with IDA Procurement Guidelines of January 1995 and Consultants Guidelines of August 1981.&#13;
4.5         The procurement arrangements for the project components are described below and are&#13;
summarized in Table 4.1. A list of contracts for Project implementation is contained in Annex I.&#13;

rehabilitate pumping stations (US$16.54 million equivalent to be financed by EBRD), and the other to&#13;
rehabilitate both water treatment plants, which will be financed by IDA (US$21.85 million equivalent)&#13;
will be procured under ICB procedures. To procure the rehabilitation of the treatment plant contract, a&#13;
two-stage bidding process for prequalified contractors will be used. The first stage will comprise&#13;
technical proposals on the basis of the conceptual designs already prepared by the consultants. The&#13;
second stage will comprise priced bids on the basis of the amended final technical proposals.&#13;
&#13;

4.7        Civil Works. Small and scattered civil works in packages not to exceed US$100,000&#13;
equivalent, which would not be of interest to foreign contractors, in an aggregate amount not to exceed&#13;
US$6.0 million equivalent, would be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of quotation obtained from at least three prequalified contractors in response to a written invitation.&#13;
The invitation will include a detailed description of works, including specifications and drawings (where&#13;
applicable), the required completion date, and a basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA.  These&#13;
contracts will be for the installation of equipment and material procured separately, such as the installation&#13;
of meters and the construction of workshops at the district level. Newly formed local contracting&#13;
companies with foreign capital are expected to qualify and create a competitive environment for the&#13;
procurement of these contracts.&#13;
4.8        Goods. Several goods contracts for the supply of water meters, computers, operating and&#13;
maintenance equipment, and maintenance stores with an aggregate value of US$24.86 million equivalent&#13;
which will be financed by IDA, will be procured through ICB procedures, using IDA Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for Goods. A margin of preference equal to 15% of CIF price of imported goods or actual&#13;
custom duties and import taxes, whichever is less, will be allowed for domestic manufactures. Purchase&#13;
of goods in packages less than US$100,000 with an aggregate value of US$2.30 million equivalent,&#13;
comprising operation and maintenance equipment, and spare parts for repair work will be procured by&#13;
International Shopping. A minimum of three quotations from qualified suppliers from at least two&#13;
different countries will be required. Furniture and construction materials to be financed by IDA, in&#13;
individual contracts not to exceed US$50,000 equivalent and in an aggregated amount of US$0.71 million&#13;
equivalent will be procured under local shopping acceptable to IDA. There are a number of local&#13;
suppliers who create a competitive environment.&#13;
4.9        Consultant Services. Consultant services for: (a) developing the Consumer Education&#13;
Campaigns; and (b) implementing institutional capacity strengthening (US$9.06 million equivalent) will&#13;
be hired through Short Listing, in accordance with IDA Guidelines for Use of Consultants. The&#13;
institutional strengthening component will be procured under a twinning arrangement with a water utility&#13;
having consulting expertise. Selection of the twinning partner is underway and is in accordance with IDA&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
4.10       IDA Prior Review.  Prior review by IDA will be required for all prequalification&#13;
procedures, and civil works and goods contracts procured through ICB, including the turnkey contract.&#13;
Also, prior review by IDA will be required for the first two locally procured contracts for works, and&#13;
consultant contracts with firms over US$100,000 equivalent. Terms of Reference for all consultancies&#13;
will be pre-reviewed by IDA. Other contracts will be subject to selective post-award review.&#13;
4.11       Local Procurement Procedures A Country Procurement Assessment Report has not yet&#13;
been completed. However, procedures to be used for local shopping were discussed with authorities in&#13;
the Ministry of Economy who confirmed that there are no laws or regulations that would prevent the&#13;
ARWC from adopting shopping procedures acceptable to IDA. In future, IDA will be assisting the&#13;
Government in the development of a regulatory framework for public procurement.&#13;
4.12       Management and Supervision of Procurement The CDU will be responsible for all&#13;
procurement under the Project. The CDU will be assisted by foreign consultants and/or local institutes&#13;
who will prepare together with ARWC staff all documentation and evaluate all bids. While the staff of&#13;
the CDU initially may be inexperienced with IDA procurement guidelines, the foreign consultants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
engaged to assist them should minimize potential procurement problems and excessive delays. The&#13;
consultants are expected to be hired by August, 1995.&#13;
4.13       Reporting Procurement information will be collected and reported by the CDU to IDA and&#13;
the EBRD for each contract award. In addition, information on the status of procurement under the&#13;
Project will be reported quarterly.&#13;
C. Disbursements&#13;
4.14       The Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of six fiscal years (1996-2001) with&#13;
an estimated closing date of December 31, 2001.  Forecasts of expenditures and disbursements are&#13;
shown in Annex J. Allocation of IDA Credit Proceeds are shown below Table 4.2 below.&#13;

4.15       Withdrawal applications will be supported by standard documentation, with the exception&#13;
of applications for expenditures against (i) the first two contracts for works, (ii) contracts of less than&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent for works and US$100,000 equivalent for goods contracts, which will be&#13;
submitted on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) audited by independent auditors acceptable&#13;
to IDA. In such cases, procurement and other supporting documentation will be retained by the CDU.&#13;
Procurement and other documentation related to SOE disbursements will be subject to post review. The&#13;
minimum withdrawal application will be US$50,000. Use of the SOE procedure is justified based on the&#13;
relative simplicity of the Project's financing arrangements. The design and construction supervision&#13;
consultant will assist the CDU with the establishment of suitable accounting for all project expenditures&#13;
and particularly with the administrative procedures for the satisfactory handling of SOEs. The technical&#13;
assistance will include the preparation of a manual describing these procedures.&#13;
4.16       A quarterly disbursement schedule for monitoring disbursements is contained in Annex J.&#13;
The IDA credit closing date will be eight years from Credit approval (December 31, 2003). However,&#13;
it may well be that Project implementation will progress faster than the average IDA project for the water&#13;
and sewerage sector in which case disbursements to ARWC will be made at a higher rate. Revenue&#13;
generation and expenditure estimates used in the financial projections therefore have been made on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
conservative assumption that the Project will be completed in six years.&#13;
4.17       Special Account. To facilitate payment of small and medium-size amounts in foreign&#13;
currency and all payments in local currency, the ARWC would open a special account in US dollars at&#13;
a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The accounting records for this fund will be maintained by the&#13;
CDU. The maximum authorized allocation of the Special Account would be US$1 million. The initial&#13;
amount to be deposited at the beginning of disbursements will be US$200,000, but this amount will be&#13;
increased to the maxirnum authorized allocation once the level of disbursement has reached SDR 2&#13;
million. The eligibility criteria for special accounts is given in Annex K.&#13;
D. Project Monitoring&#13;
4.18       Auditing Arrangements. Both the Project accounts and those for the ARWC will be&#13;
subject to a formal audit.  The auditor's report will include a statement on the adequacy of the&#13;
accounting system and internal controls, the reliability of the SOEs as a basis for Credit disbursements,&#13;
and compliance with covenants of the Credit Agreement. Agreement was obtained during negotiations&#13;
that beginning with calendar year 1995, the ARWC will have the Project accounts audited, the IDA&#13;
Special Account and its financial statements audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA, and&#13;
will submit annually to IDA such audited accounts within six months of the end of each year.&#13;
4.19       Monitoring Targets. Success in Project implementation will be measured against the&#13;
physical and financial targets established in Annex L. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that&#13;
actual performance for each of the targets will be compared against the appraisal estimates and reported&#13;
to IDA on a semi-annual basis.&#13;
4.20       Reporting Requirements. Semi-annual progress implementation reports will be due on&#13;
February 15 and August 15 for the six months ending December 31 and June 30. The quarterly reports&#13;
will be due on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15, for the quarters ending December&#13;
31, March 31, June 30, and September 30. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that ARWC will&#13;
submit to IDA, each year, until the Project is completed and the Credit is closed, semi-annual reports on&#13;
implementation and quarterly reports on their financial performance. The reports, which will be in&#13;
addition to BWA's annual report, will consist of at least the following:&#13;
(i) Semi-Annual Project Implementation Report:&#13;
a. a brief description of the progress in implementation;&#13;
b. status of the Action Plan for institutional strengthening of BWA;&#13;
c. a contract procurement schedule modified to include completion percentage of&#13;
those contracts in progress or to be completed;&#13;
d. project expenditures to date by contract and source of financing; and&#13;
e. proposed actions for the next six month period.&#13;
(ii) Quarterly Fnancial Performance Report&#13;
a. a comparison of BWA's actual performance against project targets;&#13;
b. a brief description of the financial condition of BWA at the end of each&#13;
reporting period;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
c.  annual historical financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash&#13;
flows);&#13;
d.  annual projected financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, source&#13;
and use of funds);&#13;
e.  quarterly financial statements (balance sheet, income statement and source and&#13;
use of funds) for the preceding quarter and projections for the subsequent&#13;
quarter;&#13;
f.  tariff schedule in effect at the end of the reporting period and date of changes;&#13;
and&#13;
g.  proposed actions for the next quarter.&#13;
E. Project Supervision&#13;
4.21        Intensive supervision will be required for the first year following Credit effectiveness,&#13;
notably because the agencies involved in the Project lack experience not only with IDA but also with&#13;
project management and procurement methods.  Initially, supervision would focus on project&#13;
management, procurement, project financing, IDA disbursement procedures, and methods of payment&#13;
and reporting. In the second year, attention will focus on the institutional and financial aspects of the&#13;
Project. Normally, two supervision missions per year comprising an engineer, a financial analyst, and&#13;
(as needed) an institutional development specialist, each of two weeks' duration, would be sufficient to&#13;
supervise a project such as this. In the first year, however, this time allocation will be doubled to reflect&#13;
the needs of the borrower. In the second year, staff supervision will revert to two missions comprising&#13;
two (or three) staff members for two weeks each. A detailed project supervision forecast is given in&#13;
Annex M. On the basis of this forecast, and on an average cost of US$9,000 per staff member per&#13;
mission, the total IDA cost of supervision missions over a four year period for the Project will be about&#13;
US$270,000.&#13;
V. FINANCES&#13;
A. Past and Present Financial Performance&#13;
5.1         Past Financial Performance of BWA. A summary statement of revenues and expenditures&#13;
for the last four years is shown in Table 5.1, with further details contained in Annex N. The figures&#13;
indicate that, in terms of revenue growth, the financial performance of BWA has improved significantly&#13;
over the 1991-94 period; improving from a loss of Manats 0.1 million in 1991 to a pre-tax net income&#13;
of Manats 3,520 million (US$ 2.6 million) in 1994. This substantial improvement in pre-tax net income&#13;
was a function of the: (i) high rate of inflation in Azerbaijan7; (ii) significant decline in the international&#13;
value of the Manat8; and (iii) substantial increases in water tariffs. However, the increased revenue and&#13;
pre-tax net income has not resulted in an improvement in the overall financial position for BWA.&#13;
7 inflation increased by 202 percent in 1991, 1174 percent in 1992, 1081 percent in 1993, and about 15 percent&#13;
per month in 1994.&#13;
US$ = Manats 44.5 in December 1992, 265 in December 1993, and 3,900 in December 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Accounts receivable, for example, have risen substantially in the last three years, from 40 percent of total&#13;
revenue in 1992 (Manats 49 million or US$ 1.1 million equivalent) to 66 percent of total revenue in 1994&#13;
(Manats 12.4 billion or US$3.0 million equivalent). This sharp rise in accounts receivable is largely&#13;
attributable to the current economic difficulties and to the poor level of service which BWA provides.&#13;
According to BWA records, at the end of 1994 delinquent accounts receivable comprised: industrial&#13;
enterprises at 57 percent of the total, government institutions 20 at percent, domestic consumers at 11&#13;
percent and others at 3 percent.&#13;

Operating Ratio                        101.2%       72.1%       77.6%        81.3%&#13;

5.2        In order to balance the cash flow, the increase in accounts receivable was offset by a similar&#13;
increase in accounts payable. which have risen from 42 percent of direct operating expenses in 1992&#13;
(Manats 36.7 million or US$ 0.8 million) to 76 percent of direct operating costs in 1994 (Manats 11.0&#13;
billion or US$ 2.6 million). At the end of 1994, accounts payable comprised monies owing for : (a)&#13;
electricity at Manats 7.3 billion (US$ 1.8 million) or 69 percent of the total; and (b) raw water charges&#13;
at Manats 1.8 billion (US$ 0.4 million) or 17 percent payable. Raw water charges are payable to the&#13;
Ministry of Irrigation, and the local municipalities Sabirabad and Hachmas.&#13;
5.3        The 1994 balance sheet indicates that the gross book value of fixed assets in operation was&#13;
Manats 46.1 billion (US$ 11.8 million). In the last three years, assets have been revalued by a factor&#13;
28 in 1993 and by a factor of 31 in 1994 in an attempt to reflect the impact of high inflation and the&#13;
declining value of the Manat. Similarly, annual depreciation allowances have increased from Manats 1.8&#13;
million (US$ 96,000) in 1991 to Manats 779.5 million (US$ 423,000) in 1994. Despite these&#13;
adjustments, the book value of BWA assets is considerably lower than replacement costs.&#13;
5.4        A review of the BWA income statement revealed the following observations:&#13;
(a)   Staffimg and Salaries. While BWA staff has remained more or less constant at 3,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
employees, salary costs have decreased from 14 percent of direct operating expenses in&#13;
1991 to 8 percent in 1992, 5 percent in 1993 and 2 percent in 1994;&#13;
(b)   Electricity. Electricity is the largest component of direct operating expenses, accounting&#13;
for 44 percent in 1991, 42 percent in 1992, 56 percent in 1993 and 60 percent in 1994. In&#13;
line with the development of a market economy, there will likely be substantial real&#13;
increases in electricity tariffs in the near future. Because the Baku system is largely&#13;
dependent on pumped water supplies and the pumps are generally old and inefficient, it is&#13;
clear that improving the efficiency of these pumps is of utmost importance. Reducing the&#13;
amount of unaccounted for water will result in a significant reduction in electricity costs;&#13;
(c)   Maintenance.  BWA financial data indicate that maintenance costs range between 27&#13;
percent to 34 percent of annual direct operating expenses. This relative low proportion&#13;
(when compared to electricity) indicates significant deferred maintenance.&#13;
5.5        In tenns of overall financial management, there are three significant factors that impede the&#13;
performance of BWA, notably:&#13;
(a)   Lack of Explicit Financial Objectives. BWA has no clearly defined financial objectives.&#13;
Historically, the main aim of the utility was to provide water first to industry and then on&#13;
a heavily cross-subsidized basis to domestic consumers. The concept of providing an&#13;
improved cost-effective service which encouraged more effective use of available water&#13;
resources and optimization of existing facilities was not a prime concern under the old&#13;
centrally planned system;&#13;
(b)   Financial Accounting Systems. An adequate accounting system was never a priority in the&#13;
BWA. Even today, each operating department maintains its own accounting and payment&#13;
system. A small central accounting department consolidates the financial information and&#13;
reports in the manner prescribed by the Ministry of Finance. Recently, however, the&#13;
Government has prepared a draft Accountancy Law based on western practices. This law&#13;
is expected to be approved by late-1995 or early-1996, and the new accounting regulations&#13;
should greatly improve the financial transparency of business enterprises; and&#13;
(c)   Billing and Collection.  A responsive billing and collection system was also of low&#13;
priority. For example, two old desk-top computers are used for the billing system, but&#13;
memory limitations permit only one month's records to be stored at any given time. Bills&#13;
are delivered by hand and domestic consumers are expected to pay the charges directly to&#13;
the delivery clerk; while industrial companies and institutions are supposed to have their&#13;
water bills deducted by direct transfer from their bank accounts. Moreover, in the event&#13;
of nonpayment, there are no sanctions imposed on the consumer.&#13;
5.6        Water Tariffs. As shown in Table 5.2, industrial consumers historically have accounted&#13;
for the largest share of water revenue, although this proportion has declined from 72 percent of total&#13;
water sales in 1991 to 48 percent in 1994. Industrial companies accounted for about 35 percent of&#13;
estimated water consumption. On the other hand, domestic consumers accounted for about 52 percent&#13;
of water consumption in 1994 but only 20 percent of total revenue, indicating a substantial internal cross-&#13;
subsidy from industrial to residential consumers.&#13;

5.7         Although the regulation of water tariffs is provided by the office of the Mayor of Baku,&#13;
there is no specified formula for price increases. Nevertheless, water tariffs have increased substantially&#13;
over the last two years, partly in an effort to keep pace with inflation and partly to generate the minimum&#13;
cash flows required to establish BWA on a self financing basis. Table 5.3 illustrates the tariff structure&#13;
from December 1992 to October 1994. The figures show that over a period of 22 months, tariffs have&#13;
increased between 70 and 180 percent. In terms of US$ equivalent, the industrial and institutional tariffs&#13;
were effectively doubled, while domestic tariffs remained relatively unchanged. Although lower tariffs&#13;
are charged to domestic consumers and higher charges are levied on industrial and institutional&#13;
consumers, the tariff structure is based on a flat rate (most domestic consumers are charged on the basis&#13;
of 12 in3 per person per month or 400 liters per person per day). Industrial and institutional consumers&#13;
are in theory charged on the basis of metered consumption, but most bills are levied on a quota basis&#13;
because most of the water meters do not work.&#13;

B. Future Financial Performance&#13;
5.8         Table 5.4 summarizes ARWC's financial projections for the period 1993-2005 (see Annex&#13;
N for details). The financial projections have been prepared in US dollars, largely because of the&#13;
uncertainty about the future rate of inflation in Azerbaijan. The financing plan included in the financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
projections assumes that about 50 percent of the capital requirements will be financed by IDA, 30 percent&#13;
by EBRD, 4 percent by the European Union and 16 percent by the Government of Azerbaijan. The&#13;
financial projections also assume that ARWC's repayment conditions to the Government will be as&#13;
follows: (i) IDA funds at 7 percent interest rate with repayment over 25 years, including five years grace;&#13;
(ii) EBRD funds at 7.5 percent interest rate (LIBOR plus one percent) with repayment over 15 years,&#13;
including three years grace; and (c) the Government's contribution treated as an equity investment.&#13;
Interest during construction will be capitalized.&#13;

Note (1): Depreciation Charges may increase as a result of future asset revaluations.&#13;
5.9        The financial projections show the operating revenue increasing threefold; from US$ 12.1&#13;
million in 1994 to US$ 23.3 million in 1997 and US$ 32.5 million by the year 2000. This level of&#13;
increase is required to cover the rising costs of operation (particularly much higher electricity costs) and&#13;
depreciation. ARWC's operating ratio is expected to rise to about 104 percent in 1995 and then steadily&#13;
fall to about 76 percent by 2000. This reflects a higher level of net income before interest in order to&#13;
cover the debt service requirements. Beyond the year 2000, this position will allow ARWC to build&#13;
additional cash reserves for financing subsequent investments. Thus, ARWC can be financially self-&#13;
sustaining, providing that (i) water consumption grows in line with the projections; (ii) unaccounted for&#13;
water is substantially reduced; (iii) the revenue projections are fulfilled; (iv) accounts receivable are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
brought under control; (v) adequate levels of maintenance are sustained; (vi) reorganization, training and&#13;
technical assistance are implemented; and (vii) water tariffs are periodically adjusted to maintain progress&#13;
towards full cost recovery.&#13;
5.10       The financial projections also indicate that average water tariffs will need to be increased&#13;
by 40 percent in 1995, 25 percent in 1996, 20 percent in 1997, 15 percent in 1998, 10 percent in 1999,&#13;
and 5 percent in 2000. Therefore, average tariffs are expected to increase by about 180 percent over a&#13;
five-year period, from an average of US$ 0.046 per m3 in 1994 to US$ 0.13 per m3 in 2000 - all in terms&#13;
of current prices.&#13;
5.11       In order to ensure that ARWC is established and maintained on a financially viable basis,&#13;
the following agreements were obtained during negotiations:&#13;
(a)   a water tariff study will be commissioned to examine water charging policy, tariff structure&#13;
and rate levels by consumer category. The study will be completed by June 30, 1996. It&#13;
is expected that a long-term tariffstructure will be agreed upon during the mid-term review,&#13;
after the completion of the tarif study;&#13;
(b)  tariffs will be increased by an amount sufficient generate revenues at least sufficient to&#13;
cover: (a) all operating and maintenance expenses; (b) dcbt service requirements; and (c)&#13;
non-cash items, including depreciation and replacement costs. In this connection, assurance&#13;
will also be obtained during negotiations that ARWC will submit to IDA for review and&#13;
comment no later than June 30 of each year as part of its quarterly report for the third&#13;
quarter, its proposed budget and tariffs for the following year with supporting financial&#13;
projections;&#13;
(c)   no additional long-term debt will be incurred unless a reasonable forecast of the revenues&#13;
and expenses show that the estimated net revenues for each fiscal year during the term of&#13;
the debt to be incurred will be at least 1.2 times the estimated debt service requirements in&#13;
such year on all debt including the debt to be incurred;&#13;
(d)   an action plan for the effective recovery of outstanding water bills will be prepared and&#13;
initiated by December 31, 1995 and will include a provision in future financial statements&#13;
for bad debts;&#13;
(e)   establish a program to monitor and implement effective measures to improve efficiency in&#13;
energy utilization and conservation; and&#13;
Q9   commission an asset valuation study to be completed by December 31, 1997;&#13;
&#13;

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
Project Justification&#13;
6.1        Besides being the capital city, Baku is the administrative, cultural, commercial and industrial&#13;
center of Azerbaijan. Therefore, it is imperative that the city should have a positive impact on the rest&#13;
of the nation which is struggling to develop an open-market economy and secure the long term benefits&#13;
of significant oil exports. In this context, infrastructural development will have a key role to play in&#13;
providing the framework for industry and commerce to prosper, and give ordinary citizens the confidence&#13;
that their general standard of living will gradually improve. The Project will make a significant&#13;
contribution in this development process.&#13;
6.2        The main justifications for the Project are sunmmarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   significant reduction in the high level of unaccounted for water, from the present estimated&#13;
level of 66 percent to less than 45 percent;&#13;
(b)  improvements in the hours of service from the current average level of six hours per day&#13;
to approximately 12 hours per day;&#13;
(c)   reduction in water pressure constraints in various parts of the city so more households in&#13;
high-rise apartment blocks will receive an acceptable supply;&#13;
(d)  improvements in water quality arising from a reduction in the intermittent service which has&#13;
allowed contaminated water to be ingested into the system. This will also have a significant&#13;
impact on reducing waterborne and water related diseases;&#13;
(e)   upgrading the maintenance, control and performance functions of the ARWC. This, coupled&#13;
with the reduction in unaccounted for water, will generate significant savings in operating&#13;
costs (particularly electricity) and improve productivity; and&#13;
(f)  firm proposals for institutional change and human resource development. These benefits will&#13;
not ordy be realized within the water supply operation, but also have an important&#13;
demonstration effect for other public utility enterprises.&#13;
6.3        Nevertheless, the Project represents only the beginning in a long campaign to provide Baku&#13;
with a modem and financially sustainable water supply system. One aspect which deserves particular&#13;
emphasis, to complement the physical rehabilitation and improvements in the water supply system, is the&#13;
initiative aimed at developing an effective and coordinated public health and environmental education&#13;
program to raise community awareness and encourage active participation.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
6.4        The main quantifiable benefits resulting from the Project will include: (a) willingness to pay&#13;
for an improved water supply system, particularly in terms of a reduction in the need for families to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
invest in "coping" strategies to secure a reasonable arnount of water; (b) improvements in the standards&#13;
of public health and hygiene by reducing the incidence of waterborne and water related diseases; and (c)&#13;
incremental savings in annual operating costs. The resulting distribution of quantified benefits is&#13;
summarized in Table 6.1, with a more extensive analysis in Annex P. The figures show that by the year&#13;
2000, 60 percent of the quantified benefits are generated by savings in annual operating costs, with 32&#13;
percent attributable to willingness to pay and 8 percent to public health benefits. By the year 2005,&#13;
willingness to pay accounts for 48 percent, savings in annual operating costs 48 percent and public health&#13;
benefits 8 percent.&#13;

Least-Cost Solution&#13;
6.5         The main investment objective of the Project is to increase the availability of water to&#13;
existing customers. The alternatives considered were to increase production capacity or to reduce leakage&#13;
and wastage by rehabilitation and a water demand management program. Current data indicate&#13;
unaccounted for water at between 65-70 percent of production. The next increment of supply would cost&#13;
la minimum of US$100 million and would have to be coupled with a major network rehabilitation&#13;
program. Financial constraints plus the fact that the existing per capita production capacity of 800 lcd&#13;
would be sufficient to meet system demands if the system were tight, household plumbing did not leak&#13;
and customers did not waste water, make rehabilitation the only feasible alternative and the least cost&#13;
solution.&#13;
Economic Internal Rate of Return&#13;
6.6         The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) to the project was calculated on the basis of&#13;
the quantified benefits outlined in para. 6.5, with a full presentation in Annex 0. The incremental cost&#13;
and benefit streams were compared over a period of 15 years, which represents the expected life of the&#13;
main project rehabilitation components. All costs and benefits are expressed in mid-1994 constant&#13;
economic prices, in which foreign exchange, labor and electricity are shadow priced. The resulting EIRR&#13;
is 26.7 percent, which clearly demonstrates that the project is a worthwhile investment. The sensitivity&#13;
tests also indicate that the results are generally robust to variations in the cost and benefit parameters. For&#13;
example, if costs are increased by 10 percent and benefits are lagged by two years, the EIRR is still in&#13;
excess of 12 percent which is considered to be the opportunity cost of capital in Azerbaijan.&#13;
Nevertheless, the rates of return are considered to be a conservative estimate of the real value of the&#13;
project to Baku because of the serious nature of the water supply problems in the city and the substantial&#13;
unquantified benefits as outlined below:&#13;
(a)   property value enhancement, which will become more apparent as the market for residential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
property begins to develop;&#13;
(b)   environmental benefits through a substantial reduction in non revenue water, improvements&#13;
in water quality, reduction in the number of burst water mains, and less pumping from local&#13;
groundwater sources which are both polluted and suffering from saline intrusion;&#13;
(c)  recreation and amenity improvements through the rehabilitation of water supply facilities&#13;
which will enhance the city's development prospects as a tourism center;&#13;
(d)  industrial and regional development in the medium to long term will benefit from a more&#13;
reliable and adequate water supply to support the recovery program into the next century;&#13;
and&#13;
(e)   national and regional development objectives will receive a significant boost through an&#13;
improved public utility service which will raise living standards and enhance the public's&#13;
trust in other components of the Government's development strategy.&#13;
Average Incremental Cost (AIC) of Water&#13;
6.7         The average incremental cost (AIC) of water represents the marginal cost of increasing the&#13;
quantity of water delivered through a substantial reduction in the volume of unaccounted for water. The&#13;
results are presented in Table 6.2 (see Annex 0 for details). The AIC has been calculated only for the&#13;
Project and not for the next increment of production capacity which may be developed as part of a future&#13;
project. The results indicate that at a discount rate of 12 percent (assumed to be the opportunity cost of&#13;
capital in Azerbaijan), the AIC would be US$ 0.02 per m3 in economic prices and US$ 0.03 per m3 in&#13;
financial prices. These values are below the average water tariff for 1994 of about US$ 0.046 per i3,&#13;
largely because of the substantial electricity savings which will accrue as a result of the reduction in&#13;
unaccounted for water from the current level of about 65 percent to the projected level of less than 45&#13;
percent when the Project is fully operational.&#13;

Affordability&#13;
6.8        Affordability and ability to pay are key parameters in assessing whether the proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
investment is affordable in view of the more stringent financial objectives, the need to repay the&#13;
international loans and credits, and the aim of sustaining a viable future development program. The&#13;
general conclusions are that the projected water tariffs would not impose an unacceptable burden on&#13;
average and low income households in Baku. Table 6.3 summarizes the affordability of forecast water&#13;
tariffs after project completion in the year 2000 (see Annex P for details). For the average income&#13;
household, the monthly water bill would amount to 2.6 percent of projected income (compared with I&#13;
percent in 1994); and for the low income household, it would amount to 3.7 percent of projected income&#13;
(2.2 percent in 1994).&#13;

6.9        The Social Assessment Survey commissioned by the Bank in July 1994 indicates that the&#13;
stated average household income was US$ 44 per month and low income households at about US$ 20 per&#13;
month (45 percent of the average household income). The Survey also reported that families would be&#13;
willing to pay 5 to 10 percent of household income for a reliable water supply service. The standard&#13;
normally used in Bank/IDA Projects is 5 percent of household income and is the target adopted for the&#13;
Project. Because there are no sewerage charges at present, no allowance was made for sewerage in&#13;
determining affordability.&#13;

6.10       The impact of the project on the urban poor and other vulnerable groups (e.g. the elderly&#13;
and pensioners on fixed incomes) is an important consideration for the Government and the Bank Group.&#13;
The investment package will have a direct and beneficial impact on these groups by reducing the time&#13;
and effort spent locating, transporting, storing, boiling and filtering water. The results of the Baku Social&#13;
Assessment Survey (July 1994) show that households on low incomes spend about 7.1 percent of their&#13;
monthly income in securing minimal quantities of water from a variety of sources; compared with higher&#13;
income households who spend about 2.1 percent of their income in securing an adequate supply.&#13;
Therefore, an improved public water supply system will be of greater benefit to the urban poor.&#13;
6.11       The project will improve service delivery and reduce the burden on women in the Greater&#13;
Baku area. The present water problems place the heaviest burden on women as managers of household&#13;
affairs. Normal household duties may take twice as long because of the daily water shortages and&#13;
intermittent supply. Women have to be in their house or apartment when water is available in order to&#13;
ensure that storage tanks and other receptacles are filled. On the occasions when there is no water or the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
pressure is low in the high-rise apartment blocks, women and other members of the family must carry&#13;
water from apartments on lower floors, purchase water from street vendors and use old wells in the peri-&#13;
urban areas which are often polluted. The project will help to alleviate these conditions by providing a&#13;
more continuous water service.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
6.12       There are risks inherent to a first-time investment operation for a new borrower. These&#13;
risks include: (a) delays in Project implementation due to the limited experience of the ARWC in this type&#13;
of activity; (b) possible understatement of construction costs due the very limited experience of ARWC&#13;
with actual costs for implementation and previous lack of construction experience to international&#13;
standards in this sector; (c) reluctance of the Government to face up to the challenges of implementing&#13;
the requisite sector and institutional reforms; (d) underestimating the extraordinary effort and long-term&#13;
commitment required to achieve financial viability in the water supply sector; and (e) unrealistic and&#13;
hence demoralizing expectations that Baku water supply crisis could be resolved in a short period of time.&#13;
These risks will be reduced through the early establishment of a twinning arrangement with another water&#13;
utility, by significant supervision by staff from Bank headquarters, by the use of appropriate physical and&#13;
price contingencies, by the continuing dialogue with the Government and ARWC, by building the&#13;
capacity of ARWC to carry out its responsibilities effectively through extensive technical assistance&#13;
support, and by the public extensive information and public education programs to be financed under the&#13;
Project.&#13;

BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.           Between August 1994 and January 1995 a social assessment (SA) was carried out as part&#13;
of the preparation of the Baku Water Supply Rehabilitation Project. The objectives of this assessment&#13;
were to: identify stakeholders and propose a framework for involving them in project design and&#13;
implementation; evaluate the social impacts of the proposed interventions on households and enterprises&#13;
in Baku, and if necessary, propose mitigation measures for those who may be adversely affected; help&#13;
identify priority interventions to improve the water supply situation; and ensure that the project's&#13;
objectives and incentives for change would be acceptable to all beneficiaries, particularly the poor.&#13;
2.           The SA consisted of: a household survey on water availability, quality, and strategies&#13;
for coping with an inadequate public water supply; a household survey on water consumption,&#13;
conservation, and leakage; and an industrial water use survey. These surveys were complemented by&#13;
informal interviews with private sector providers of water and water supply equipment, discussions with&#13;
key stakeholders, and selected case studies. These activities revealed that there is a large and effective&#13;
demnand for water supply improvements and confirmed that the key beneficiaries supported the project's&#13;
priority A interventions. The key findings are:&#13;
*     Although almost 100 percent of the population has access to safe water, the water is of&#13;
poor quality and available to individual households on average about 22 days per month,&#13;
4 hours per day. Moreover, only 13 percent of the households believe that the water&#13;
they receive is clean.&#13;
*     Although the public water service is inadequate throughout Baku, low-income groups&#13;
suffer the most from the current water situation. Other groups who appear to be largely&#13;
affected are women (who bear the responsibility for securing alternative water supplies),&#13;
the elderly (who have problems fetching and carrying water), residents living on the&#13;
higher floors of buildings (who receive even less water due to insufficient pressure), and&#13;
residents of peripheral communities and informal settlements (who have less developed&#13;
water pumping and distribution infrastructure than the other areas).&#13;
*     Households spend up to 17 times the cost of their monthly water bills on alternative water&#13;
supplies. And the poor spend a significantly higher percentage of their income on&#13;
strategies to cope with inadequate public water supplies than wealthier families. Not&#13;
surprisingly, these high costs reflect a relatively high willingness to pay by households&#13;
for a better water supply with the poor willing to spend a significantly higher share of&#13;
their income on a more reliable public supply than higher income families. These&#13;
findings show that the poor would profit the most from the planned project.&#13;
*     There are important geographic and socioeconomic variations in the distribution of water&#13;
and the way people in various neighborhoods deal with an insufficient and unreliable&#13;
public water supply. Interventions, therefore, should be designed to meet the needs of&#13;
specific communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;
Page 2 of 15&#13;
BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
*     The main reasons for intermittent water supply and poor water quality are dysfunctional&#13;
pumping stations, illegal pipe connections, and leakages. On average there are 2.1 water&#13;
leaks in a Baku household. Assuming that water is supplied by the water agency an&#13;
average of 4 hours a day throughout the city, water loss will be approximately 100 liters&#13;
per day. Assuming that water is supplied an average of 6 hours a day, the water loss&#13;
will be about 150 liters per capita/day.  Similarly, if water is supplied for 11 hours a&#13;
day, water loss can be expected to be 275 liters per capita/day. As the water supply&#13;
is improved and the number of supply hours increase, therefore, the level of water loss&#13;
also will increase unless preventive measures are adopted at two levels:  at the&#13;
community and household level and the main supply network. The project is responding&#13;
to both of these.&#13;
*     The extent of water losses from leaks in households and in the water distribution system&#13;
point clearly at the urgent need for community-based repair and maintenance as well as&#13;
a major network repair program.  Furthermore, sufficient cost recovery through&#13;
improved metering and billing procedures is a critical prerequisite for a better repair and&#13;
maintenance performance.&#13;
*     Cost recovery from enterprises has been unsatisfactory. Only around 35 to 50 percent&#13;
of industrial units have fully functioning water meters. This is mainly a result of&#13;
inadequate meter material (plastic) and unsatisfactory meter durability. Currently, of the&#13;
91 percent of enterprises still working, only 15 percent pay their water bills. The&#13;
project, therefore, should address the need for improved metering and cost recovery.&#13;
3.    In addition to confirming the need for the proposed project, which already had included measures&#13;
to improve water pressure and quality as well as institutional reform, the findings of the SA and related&#13;
participation led to several additional interventions. The following were discussed at a stakeholder&#13;
workshop in February 1995 (see para. 6) and are now included in the water demand management and&#13;
institutional capacity building components:&#13;
*     A metering and billing program designed to conserve water and improve cost recovery.&#13;
The SA revealed a willingness to pay for improved water supply and a need to improve&#13;
citywide water metering and billing. Based on the SA, specific recommendations were&#13;
made on the design and implementation of this program, including guidance on the types&#13;
of households and enterprises to be metered in the first phase of investment.&#13;
*     A consumer outreach and awareness raising program designed to provide information and&#13;
advice on reducing water losses and to build public awareness about the scarcity of water&#13;
and need for conservation, the importance of community participation in leakage repair&#13;
programs, the need to pay for water, and the advantages of metering for improved cost&#13;
recovery. The SA identified the need for two types of programs: those to help mobilize&#13;
communities to carry out the necessary repairs and metering, and those required to&#13;
sustain longer-term public support for the project and future investments.&#13;

*     A community-based household leakage prevention program to improve water supply&#13;
conditions for 40,000 households. The SA and related participatory activities led to the&#13;
design of this intervention, highlighted key criteria for selecting the first group of&#13;
beneficiaries, and ensured community mobilization to this end..&#13;
*     Institution building in participatory planning to ensure effective user participation in&#13;
project implementation and monitoring as well as in designing follow-up projects to&#13;
sustain development impacts. The findings of the SA pointed to the need for technical&#13;
assistance to help the water agency implement the consumer education program. An&#13;
appropriate means for building capacity in this area is to establish a consumer relations&#13;
unit within the water agency.&#13;
4.            Although started after the initial design of the project, the SA generated important&#13;
information that ordinarily is unavailable at such an early stage of project preparation. The insights&#13;
gained from the SA allowed the project designers and other stakeholders to fine-tune the project to meet&#13;
specific local needs and identify priority measures. The remainder of this annex describes in more detail&#13;
the components and key findings of the SA as well as their implications for project design and future&#13;
investments.&#13;
B. Components of the Social Assessment&#13;
5.            The SA provided a framework for incorporating participation and social analysis into the&#13;
design of the Baku water supply project. It was a highly participatory process that consisted of the&#13;
following components:&#13;
*     Rapid survey of 400 households, undertaken with the assistance of local academicians and&#13;
researchers, with a main focus on water availability, quality, willingness to pay, and&#13;
strategies to cope with the water shortage.&#13;
*     Rapid survey of 410 households focusing on water consumption, water conservation, and&#13;
water leakage in households.&#13;
*     Rapid survey of 51 Baku enterprises focusing on water consumption, recycling, metering&#13;
and cost recovery.&#13;
*     Community based discussions, conducted through informnal household visits and&#13;
interviews.&#13;
*     Institutional assessments and discussions with key informants in national and local&#13;
governments, international institutions, enterprises and NGOs.&#13;
*     Informal interviews with private sector providers of water and water supply equipment.&#13;

0      Case studies of a small sub-set of households and enterprises, including households with&#13;
on-site gardens or other small-scale urban agricultural activities.&#13;
6.            The results of the SA were presented at a stakeholder workshop at the start of project&#13;
appraisal. The participants included 71 participants which encompassed representatives from all sectors&#13;
of society and user groups as well as government ministries, local NGOs, members of the academic&#13;
community. local experts, the media, and donors (EBRD, World Bank). The meeting generated&#13;
substantive participation and a high level of consensus on each component and policy aspect of the&#13;
project. With respect to the findings of the social assessment, the participants strongly endorsed the&#13;
establishment of (1) an autonomous water agency to ensure full cost recovery, (2) a leak prevention and&#13;
community repair program, and (3) a public information campaign to encourage water conservation.&#13;
C. Major Findings of the Social Assessment&#13;
7.     The following presents the findings from the rapid household and industrial surveys and other&#13;
supporting SA activities. The first household survey (initiated on July 14, 1994 and completed in 14&#13;
days) identified important trends in water availability, quality, willingness to pay, and strategies to cope&#13;
with an inadequate water supply. The second household survey responded to a finding of the first survey&#13;
which revealed a discrepancy between the apparent abundance of water resources, the seemingly&#13;
economical use of water in households, and the inability of the local water agency to satisfy local&#13;
demand. The objectives of this second survey, therefore, were to: (a) examine the number, location,&#13;
and size of leaks within individual households (b) assess the costs of leakage repair and households'&#13;
ability to invest in leakage repair; (c) calculate the amount of water used by households for various&#13;
purposes; (d) compare the amounts of water used and lost, and (e) based on the results of this survey,&#13;
formulate policy recommendations for future improvements in the water supply situation in Baku.&#13;
Finally, the industrial water use survey involved macroeconomic studies on industrial output and water&#13;
use (carried out by local academicians) complemented by reports provided by Baku's water agency and&#13;
a survey of 51 enterprises.&#13;
Household Water Availability and Coping Strategies&#13;
8.            The overall performance of the public water supply system in Baku cannot be measured&#13;
only in terms of the percentage of the population having access to safe water. This frequently used index&#13;
often exaggerates what has been accomplished and conceals the presence of major obstacles to further&#13;
progress. As the situation in Baku shows, access to a public water supply system does not mean that&#13;
adequate water services are actually provided to users. While close to 100 percent of Baku's households&#13;
are officially connected to the public water network, water is available to individual families on average&#13;
only 22 days per month, 11 hours per day. Moreover, only 13 percent of households believe that the&#13;
water they receive is clean.&#13;
9.            Insufficient water pressure is the single most important cause for the unreliable and&#13;
intermittent water supply as well as poor water quality. Low pressure is caused by leakages, illegal&#13;
connections, and the poor condition of pumping stations. Low pressure in the water mains makes it&#13;
easier for sewage, contaminated ground water, and other pollutants to enter the distribution system.&#13;
&#13;

SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
10.          There are important geographic and socioeconomic variations in the distribution of water&#13;
and the way people in various neighborhoods deal with insufficient and unreliable public supply.&#13;
Peripheral communities and informal settlements that encroach on former industrial sites are particularly&#13;
disadvantaged with regard to public water supply. Interventions in the Baku water supply, therefore,&#13;
should be designed to meet the needs of specific communities. Community-tailored pilot projects will&#13;
be important building blocks in the effort to improve the overall system.&#13;
11.           An estimated 40 to 60 percent of public water is not paid for. Apart from illegal&#13;
connections and leakages, one reason for lost water revenue is the overall lack of metering equipment.&#13;
Only public institutions and industries have water meters. However, they neglect to pay water bills and&#13;
fail to repair meters, as required by the local authorities. In turn, the local government is reluctant to&#13;
enforce water payments because of the possible adverse impact on productivity and employment.&#13;
12.          Most households in Baku have developed various strategies for coping with a poor&#13;
quality, insufficient, and irregular public water supply. These strategies include boiling tap water (75&#13;
percent of all households), installing storage facilities (53 percent), drilling private wells (23 percent)&#13;
and buying water from vendors (20 percent). Moreover, households incur high costs to secure additional,&#13;
non-public water. On average, households spend about 17 times more on alternative water supplies than&#13;
on their monthly water bills (1680 manat versus 100 manat) with the poor spending a significantly higher&#13;
percent of their income (7 percent) on coping strategies than wealthier citizens (2 percent) (figure 1).&#13;
Thus, low income households experience a much greater welfare loss from unreliable public water supply&#13;
than households in higher income categories. Accordingly, the poor would profit the most from an&#13;
improved supply system.&#13;
13.          Although the inadequate water supply affects the entire population, low-income&#13;
households suffer the most because they cannot resort to expensive coping strategies. To deal with an&#13;
unreliable water supply, they are more likely to reduce the amount of water consumed rather than retrieve&#13;
additional water from alternative sources. Among the poor, women and the elderly appear to bear the&#13;
greatest burden of the water supply crisis. Women have the primary responsibility for fetching water&#13;
from alternative supplies and for caring for family members who suffer from illnesses caused by unsafe&#13;
water. The elderly, living on small retirement incomes, cannot afford to invest in alternative supply&#13;
systems and have difficulties in fetching and carrying water from outside their homes.&#13;
14.          Households would be willing to pay substantially more than their current monthly water&#13;
charge for better public water service. In fact, 84 percent would consider it "fair" to pay twice the&#13;
amount of their monthly bill (on average 100 manat) even without any improvements at all. A substantial&#13;
portion of households (63 percent) is willing to pay over ten times the current level. The study revealed&#13;
that poorer households are willing to spend a significantly higher share of their income (6 percent) on&#13;
improved water services than better-off families (1 percent) (figure 1). Although these figures seem to&#13;
be extremely high, especially the ones for the poor, they become more realistic when seen in relation to&#13;
current coping expenditures. The average household now spends 1680 manat per month to cope with&#13;
inadequately piped water supply, thus a willingness to pay up to 2000 manat for a reliable public water&#13;
service actually corresponds to a household's real experience.&#13;

SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
Household Water Consumption, Conservation, and Leakage&#13;
15.           The extent of the Baku water supply crisis is clearly evident when water quantities lost&#13;
through leaks are compared to quantities actually consumed by households. While the average Baku&#13;
family uses around 300 liters of public water per day, it loses at the same time 1.3 times more (a daily&#13;
total of 400 liters). On a per capita basis, these figures are 80 liters and 100 liters respectively. Real&#13;
per capita water consumption (not including losses) for various household activities lies at about 80 liters&#13;
per day, well below western average of 200 to 300 liters per day. Per capita water consumption is&#13;
highest on low floor levels (1-3rd floor: 82.5 liters per day), considerably lower on middle floor levels&#13;
(4-6th floor: 75.6 liters), and lowest on high levels (above 6th floor). This correlates with better water&#13;
pressure and supply on low floor levels. In order to consume even these small amounts, high-floor&#13;
residents have to store more water than their neighbors below. While up to the sixth floor around 15&#13;
liters are stored daily per capita, this amount increases significantly to 20 liters per day on higher floor&#13;
levels (figure 2).&#13;
16.           With respect to the relationship between household size and water consumption, the&#13;
survey revealed that larger households use more water than smaller families. However, the situation is&#13;
reversed when per capita consumption is used as a criterion. In this case, large households (over 6&#13;
persons) have a much lower real per capita water consumption (47 liters/day) than medium-sized&#13;
households (4 to 6 persons; 64 liters/day) and small families (1 to 3 persons, 106 liters/day), with high&#13;
statistical significance (figure 3). Given the current water tariff system, introduced by Kommunpromvod&#13;
in December 1994 and based on household size (US$.07 per household member/month), the bigger a&#13;
family, the higher the tariff per liter of public water consumed. This clearly suggests that the water&#13;
agency should base its tariffs on water quantity consumed by individual recipients. Of course such a&#13;
system would require water metering, which to date exists only for public institutions and industries.&#13;
17.           Intermittent water supply and poor water quality are mainly caused by leakage, the poor&#13;
condition of pumping stations, and illegal connections. On average there are 2.1 leaks in the Baku&#13;
household, including yard and garden plot leaks, regardless of household income. The average total&#13;
water loss in a household from all leaks is roughly 100 liters per hour. Given the average household size&#13;
of 4 and assuming an average water availability of 4 hours per day in the greater Baku area, this loss&#13;
amounts to roughly 100 liters per day/person in water losses due to leakage. If water availability is&#13;
assumed to be 11 hours, as indicated in the household survey, the loss could be as high as four times per&#13;
capita consumption. Considering the planned improvement measure for pumping stations, the higher&#13;
figures for water availability and loss through leaks become more realistic values for the near future. An&#13;
increase of water pressure alone without accompanying leakage repair will only aggravate the leakage&#13;
situation. Once supply hours and water pressure throughout the network increase, preventive measures&#13;
to control for leakage will have to be adopted at two levels: household/community and the main supply&#13;
network. The project is responding to both needs in its design.&#13;
18.           Most water is lost from toilet leaks (26.08 liters/hour) and bathroom leaks (19.95&#13;

liters/hour.). Kitchen leaks and leaks directly from public pipes contribute slightly much smaller amounts&#13;
(14.52 and 13.49 liters respectively) to the overall water loss from leakage in Baku's households. A&#13;
substantial amount of water (15.70 liters/hour) is lost through leaks in storage units (installed by families&#13;
to store water for periods in which no public water is available) (figure 4). An important factor&#13;
influencing the occurrence of leaks in buildings seems to be the responsible agency for leakage repair for&#13;
a specific building. Whenever a house maintenance office or the water agency is responsible for dealing&#13;
with leakage problems, the number of leaks per household is significantly smaller (1.78 and 2.19,&#13;
respectively) than in cases where the residents themselves or other parties (private repair persons) have&#13;
to take care of water leaks (2.88 and 4.0 respectively). These findings will be important in the&#13;
preparation of the implementation plan.&#13;
19.          Across income groups, households assess leakage repair costs to fall between US$12.5&#13;
and US$17.5. Most households do not even have 50 percent of the amount necessary for exhaustive&#13;
leakage repair. Only families in the highest income category (22.7 percent of the population) could&#13;
theoretically afford to repair all leaks in their home (Figure 5). The survey showed, however, that, in&#13;
reality almost all respondents pursue a monthly "leakage control" strategy rather than spending a high&#13;
lump sum for complete repairs. These monthly expenses average around US$1, or about 3 percent of&#13;
average household income (US$30). Residents claim that they continuously have to invest small sums&#13;
in leakage repair to avoid considerable damages to water installations and apartments. They do not have&#13;
time to save enough for thorough repairs and major replacement parts. The project, therefore, will build&#13;
on this existing potential for community mobilization and cost recovery for repairs.&#13;
Industrial Water Use&#13;
20.           Over the last few years, patterns of potable water consumption in Baku have changed&#13;
significantly. While the amount of water consumed by the population for household and communal needs&#13;
reached its peak in 1993 ( 477.7 million n3, an 18 percent increase from 1989), and fell back to 391.7&#13;
million rn3 in 1994, industrial water use decreased steadily and quite dramatically in the same period,&#13;
from 146 million rn3 (26 percent of total 1989 water consumption) in 1989 to 45 million in3 in 1994 (11&#13;
percent of total) (figure 6). Since the ratio of drinking water to technical water used by industries&#13;
(roughly 4:6) did not changed over this period, it can be concluded that industrial consumption of both&#13;
public water (including potable and technical water) and potable water in 1994 was only about one third&#13;
of consumption at full capacity, observed in 1989. This dramatic decline in industrial water consumption&#13;
is a direct consequence of lower output, which, in turn, is mainly a result of the disruption of economic&#13;
links with Russia and other former Soviet Republics after the break-up of the Soviet Union. Other&#13;
reasons are the general economic hardships brought forth by the process of privatization and transition&#13;
to a market economy. Overall reductions in industrial output between 1989 and 1994 was estimated to&#13;
be as much as 32 to 35 percent.&#13;
21.           Baku industries use three different types of water: sea water, technical water (untreated&#13;
or recycled public water), and potable public water. When working at full capacity, sea water accounts&#13;

for 80 percent of total water consumption, followed by technical water (12 percent), and potable water&#13;
(8 percent). All Baku industries together consume, at full production capacity, 146 million m3 of potable&#13;
water per year (figure 7). By far the highest share is used by the oil producing and oil refining industry&#13;
(58,4 million m3, or 40 percent), followed by light industry (20.4 million m3, 14 .0 percent), and the food&#13;
industry (15.5 million m3, 10.6 percent).&#13;
22.            During the peak period of industrial water consumption in the late 1980s and early 1990s,&#13;
some enterprises had to dig private wells or recycle water at the end of the production process in order&#13;
to cope with insufficient supply of public water. Of these two strategies, recycling was much more&#13;
widely used than wells. In 1992, only around 6 percent of all Baku enterprises with water limits had a&#13;
private well or were planning to dig one. Of this group, 44 percent had abandoned the construction&#13;
process or the retrieving of water from the well, either because of insufficient quantities or, more&#13;
frequently, because of the high salinity of groundwater. According to the water authorities, well digging&#13;
activities stagnated in the last two years; thus, the 1992 figures are still valid. By 1989, around 48&#13;
percent of industrial units with water limits in Baku had installed water recycling facilities'. This figure&#13;
remained basically unchanged over the last few years. On average, around 1200 m3/hour of supplied&#13;
water can be recirculated into the production cycle by these plants at full output capacity, but there is&#13;
potential for increased recycling capacity in the future.&#13;
23.            To control water consumption by Baku industries, a law was passed in 1989 by the city&#13;
authorities, making the purchase and installation of water meters obligatory for all enterprises with&#13;
consumption limits (around 80 percent of all Baku enterprises). However, the level of full metering of&#13;
all enterprises with limits was never reached. At the end of 1989, in 56 percent of enterprises all meters&#13;
worked, in 10 percent some meters worked, in 32 percent none of the installed meters functioned&#13;
properly, and 3 percent of enterprises had no meters at all. Over the last five years, the situation has&#13;
hardly improved. The number of industrial units with properly working meters was smaller as well&#13;
(figure 8).&#13;
24.            Recently representatives of Bakvodoprovod, Kommunpromvod's department for metering&#13;
and water sales, reported that the percentage of enterprises with correctly working meters may have&#13;
decreased even further in the last few weeks, presumably to 35 percent to 40 percent. One reason for&#13;
this phenomenon may be inadequate meter quality and durability. Lacking raw supplies of appropriate&#13;
metals, the national water meter production plant has to resort to plastic for specific meter parts.&#13;
Depending on water quality and intensity of meter use, the instruments life span may be as short as a few&#13;
months, despite best maintenance efforts. As a result of the current economic crisis, firms are simply&#13;
unable to purchase meters and to pay for installation and maintenance. Even the payment of monthly&#13;
water bills seems to be beyond the current financial scope of most enterprises. In the last three months,&#13;
'The term "recycling" is used in this report to describe the process of recirculating used water back into the production cycle. This does&#13;
not necessarily imply that water is cleaned or otherwise treated before the second usage.&#13;

around 9 percent of Baku's enterprises have applied to the water agency to stop water supply to their&#13;
facilities, where production had come to a complete halt. Of those enterprises that are still running, only&#13;
around 15 percent are paying their water bills. The project will focus on this issue, giving priority to&#13;
the installation of functioning meters to industries.&#13;
D. Implications for Project Design and Future Investments&#13;
25.           The findings derived from the rapid household and industrial surveys and agreed by key&#13;
stakeholders had clear implications for the design and implementation of the Baku Water Supply&#13;
Rehabilitation Project.  The following highlights implications for the current project and future&#13;
investments.&#13;
Project-Specific Implications&#13;
26.           The proposed project meets one of the most critical needs of the city's 2.5 million&#13;
population and will be particularly beneficial to the poor. Major improvements in the water supply&#13;
system will be achieved at an investment cost of less than US$18 per person. The rapid participatory&#13;
assessment of over 400 households and discussions with members of two major NGOs representing&#13;
vulnerable groups of women and displaced populations both strongly indicate full beneficiary support for&#13;
the project.&#13;
27.           Savings will include the conservation of the water resource itself, the time and energy&#13;
spent fetching, transporting, storing, boiling and filtering water, the gas and electricity used for water&#13;
boiling and for pumping from individual wells and pipes to overhead storage units, and the reduced costs&#13;
of ill health as measured by foregone labor productivity and medical expenses.&#13;
28.           The success of this project in improving the reliability of water delivery will enhance trust&#13;
in the service itself, and will provide public support for other components of the Goverrnent's reform&#13;
agenda. By meeting the basic need for water through institutional development measures that focus on&#13;
institutional autonomy, commercialization of the utility sector and participation of stakeholders, the&#13;
project can help to set the stage for similar reforms in the delivery of other infrastructure services.&#13;
29.           Improvements in the reliability of the water supply will create clear opportunities for cost&#13;
recovery. The strongly perceived need for the project and the high cost of coping strategies adopted to&#13;
mitigate adverse impacts of unreliability reveal preferences for a reliable water supply at a level of&#13;
affordability that could justify tariff increases to at least five times the current levels for the household&#13;
sector. These increases, however, would have to be complemented by an adequate metering system and&#13;
the elimination of illegal connections.&#13;
30.           Sufficient cost recovery by Kommunpromvod will be a crucial prerequisite for a better&#13;
repair and maintenance performance. A system of water charges is needed that endows the water agency&#13;
with operational and financial autonomy for the efficient and sustainable delivery of services. The current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;

SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
system of "per capita" charges' is not only unfair to larger households and families that receive below&#13;
average amounts of public water, but also fails to act as incentive for economical water use by recipients.&#13;
Although actual water use may be comparatively low presently (80 to 120 liters/day), they are likely to&#13;
increase substantially once the technical and institutional improvements are initiated. Currently, public&#13;
water is treated as a scarce good and generally used efficiently because it is not always available.&#13;
Sustainable conservation efforts among the population will only be reached through a pricing strategy that&#13;
is economically viable and socially equitable. Of course the effectiveness of this measure will depend&#13;
on the installation of properly functioning and well maintained water meters to allow a quantity based&#13;
tariff structure.&#13;
31.            The implementation of the community metering programs will take into account the&#13;
specific conditions of each community covered by the project. To help ensure the effectiveness of&#13;
household metering, the program should be implemented first where households already have low leakage&#13;
and 24 hours of continuous supply as well as garden plots. Moreover, it will be necessary to ensure&#13;
strong comnuunity mobilization and public education and outreach programs to support the community&#13;
household leakage repair program.  All of these measures will help to promote water resource&#13;
conservation and are included in the project.&#13;
32.            Given the need for overall improvement in cost recovery by the water agency from all&#13;
industry groups, an adequately designed debt repayment schedule for enterprises will be necessary. At&#13;
the same time, ongoing consumption must be correctly metered and paid for not only for effective cost&#13;
recovery, but to ensure the sustainability of water resources.&#13;
Implications for Future Investment&#13;
33.            Although in the late 1980s adequate public water supply was a major concern of Baku's&#13;
industries, water related issues have lost their priority ranking to the economic hardship experienced by&#13;
enterprises in the last few years. Once the regional conflicts in neighboring areas are solved, and the&#13;
influx of western investment and technology in connection with the exploration of oil fields in the Caspian&#13;
Sea reaches expected dimensions, industries will recover rapidly, and public water, potable and technical,&#13;
will once again be in high demand. This assumption is strengthened by the fact that, out of all branches,&#13;
the oil industry, which can be expected to grow faster than any other industrial branch in the near future,&#13;
consumes by far the largest share of potable water (40 percent). According to the most optimistic&#13;
forecasts for industrial development in Baku in the next ten years, potable water consumption by&#13;
enterprises may be as high as 160 m3/year in 2005, 10 percent higher than water consumption during the&#13;
last peak period of production in 1989. In addition to industrial water demand, potable water use by&#13;
households and comnunal institutions is expected to increase to 600 m3 in the same time period, an&#13;
amount 25 percent higher than the quantity of potable water consumed by the population in the peak year&#13;
of 1993. Thus the Bank's focus on a series of future water supply and sanitation projects in Baku is&#13;
2 In theory, Kommunpromvod sells water to the population for $0.0045 per nm. The agency further assumes a monthly per capita&#13;
water consumption of 12 m3. Since, due to the lack of meters, actual household water consumption can not be measured, this figure is used&#13;
as proxy for the calculation of water tariffs. Multiplying "assumed" monthly consumption by 0.0045, and adding taxes, a tariff of $0.07 per&#13;
person per month is obtained.&#13;

desirable and fully justified. Goals for the future must include improved supply of technical water,&#13;
increased water recycling, improved metering and cost recovery, reduced water leakage, and control of&#13;
the pollution of ground water and the Caspian Sea by industrial discharges.&#13;
34.           Future investments in environmental improvement in Baku will address wastewater&#13;
management and additional improvements in water supply services. To support these investments further&#13;
investigation will need to focus on water leakage within industrial units and the treatment of industrial&#13;
waste water. According to the findings of SA on water losses from leaks in households, large amounts&#13;
of public water are lost through leaks in the public distribution network. The industrial water use survey&#13;
indicated that water leaks also occur at individual industrial units. To assess industrial water losses&#13;
correctly, therefore, a thorough study on industrial leakage will be necessary. In addition, the treatment&#13;
of industrial wastewater will have to be more closely inspected.&#13;
35.           Unreliability of the water supply system is partially induced by the unreliability of other&#13;
infrastructure components: electricity and communications. Consequently there is a need to examine the&#13;
interdependencies within the infrastructure system and to develop solutions accordingly. There is also&#13;
a need to increase public awareness of this interdependency to avoid frustration with results that may be&#13;
unavoidable.&#13;
36.           Several of the coping strategies adopted by households, such as the storage of large&#13;
quantities of water and the drilling of wells, may have adverse environmental and health impacts.&#13;
Dramatic growth in the private production of vegetables and flowers, especially in the Epsheron&#13;
Peninsula, increases demand on the water supply and causes illegal exploitation of underground water&#13;
resources. Preliminary results of aquifer studies indicate high levels of oil infiltration to the ground&#13;
water, which is further contaminated by sewage dumps and the rising level of the Caspian Sea. In&#13;
designing future investments, therefore, there is a need to study the environmental and health impacts of&#13;
these practices and to adopt an appropriate incentive structure for change, including the development of&#13;
a regulatory framework.&#13;
37.           Large capital investments made in alternative water supply systems, such as storage tanks&#13;
and wells, may discourage participation in system improvements. For this reason, it is particularly&#13;
important to undertake the study recommended above (para. 36). Because drilling wells is largely a&#13;
response to the increased attractiveness of urban agriculture, household investments in wells has to be&#13;
viewed both as a response to the inadequacy of potable water as well as a strategy to maximize income.&#13;
Thus, the productivity implications of this use of water must be weighed while developing incentives to&#13;
discourage well drilling.&#13;

by the Company by reason of such non-payment.&#13;
45.    The notice shall name a further day (not less than fourteen days from the date of the notice)&#13;
when all such interest and expenses are to be paid. It shall also name the place where&#13;
payment is to be made, and shall state that in the event of non-payment, at or before the time&#13;
and at the place appointed, the shares in respect of which such call was made will be liable to&#13;
be forfeited. But notwithstanding any such notice the Board may waive payment of the whole&#13;
or any portion of such interest and expenses.&#13;

such notice has been given may at any time thereafter before payment of all calls, interest and&#13;
expenses due in respect thereof has made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Board.&#13;
47.    A forfeiture of shares under the preceding Article shall include all dividends declared but not&#13;

been otherwise disposed of, permit the share so forfeited to be redeemed upon the terms of&#13;
payment of all calls and interest due and expenses incurred in respect of the share, and upon&#13;
any further or other terms it may think fit.&#13;

canceled or sold, or re-allotted or otherwise, either to the person who was the holder thereof&#13;
before forfeiture, or entitled thereto, or to any other person, upon such terms and in such&#13;
manner as the Board shall think fit, and whether with or without all or any part of the amount&#13;
previously paid on the share being credited as paid. The Board may, if necessary, authorize&#13;
some person to transfer a forfeited share to any such other person.&#13;
51.    A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a shareholder in respect of the&#13;
forfeited shares but, notwithstanding, shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys&#13;
which, at the date of forfeiture, were presently payable by him to the Company in respect of&#13;
the shares, with interest thereon at such rate as the Board may determine, but his liability&#13;
shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of the nominal amount of the&#13;
shares.&#13;

share in the Company has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the declaration, shall be&#13;

BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CORPORATIZATION PARTNER&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           The Government of Azerbaijan has requested assistance from the World Bank and the&#13;
EBRD for the preparation and funding of an emergency program for the improvement of the water supply&#13;
system for the Apsheron peninsular, which has a population approaching three million people and which&#13;
includes the capital city of Baku.&#13;
2.           As a result of inadequate system design, substandard operational management and chronic&#13;
under investment, the quality of water supply services has badly deteriorated over the past 10-15 years.&#13;
In this period, almost no investments for capital improvement have been made and the entire system is&#13;
in a very poor state of maintenance and operation.&#13;
3.           The Government of Azerbaijan considers the project a priority for the country as it&#13;
recognizes the crucial importance of urban services, including water supply, for its economic restructuring&#13;
and reform program. The availability, reliability, and quality of water supplies are critical not only for&#13;
the welfare of large parts of the population (the system serves almost 40% of the population of&#13;
Azerbaijan), but also for the emergence of competitive, small and medium-size enterprises. Moreover,&#13;
the Government accepts that the long-term viability of water services depends on the organizational form&#13;
in which these services are provided and their capacity to become self-financing.&#13;
Institutional Organization of Water Supply&#13;
4.           Responsibility for the production and distribution of water in Azerbaijan is divided among&#13;
a number of Central Government departments. The Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) is responsible for the&#13;
development and allocation of surface water resources, while the Department of Geology controls and&#13;
license groundwater extraction. The MOI has the responsibility for water supply to rural areas, both for&#13;
private consumption and irrigation.&#13;
5.           The Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for setting the quality standards for drinking&#13;
water while the State Ecology Committee (SEC) is responsible for regulating environmental standards.&#13;
Neither agency is able to achieve effective enforcement largely due the lack of resources.&#13;
6.           The Ministry of Housing and Communal Property (MOHCP) owns and controls regional&#13;
and municipal water supply and sewerage departments, which are responsible for the transmission,&#13;
treatment and distribution of water and the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage, except in rural&#13;
areas where the responsibility for water supply, both for domestic and agricultural use lies with the MOI.&#13;
Kommunpromvod&#13;
7.           Greater Baku is supplied with water through a regional agency, Komnmunpromvod, which&#13;
has the dual responsibility of a regional supplier of bulk water for the towns and villages along the supply&#13;
pipelines and, through its subsidiary Bakvodopromvod, which is the retail distributor of water within the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
Page 2 of 16&#13;
BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CORPORATIZATION PARTNER&#13;
Greater Baku metropolitan area. Kommunpromvod and Bakvodopromvod-henceforward jointly referred&#13;
to as Kommunpromvod - currently employ 3,850 staff divided over several offices with headquarters&#13;
functions, several water supply offices and 9 distribution districts.  Pursuant to a Special Act of&#13;
Parliament, Kommunpromvod will be converted into a joint stock company, the Apsheron Regional Water&#13;
Company (ARWC).&#13;
8.           Besides the technical functions implied in water production and distribution,&#13;
Kommnunpromvod's responsibilities include revenue administration. The company operates a basic,&#13;
computerized billing system. It also collects charges from industrial and commercial consumers. The&#13;
City of Baku collects water charges from domestic consumers, together with user charges for other&#13;
municipal services, and transfers the proceeds to the Central Government which subsequently redistributes&#13;
(part) of it to Kommunpromvod. The tariff of water charges for domestic users is set in consultation with&#13;
the Mayor of Baku and in most cases is based on a fixed assumed consumption of 22 m3 per person per&#13;
day. Industrial tariffs are set by the Ministry of Economy. Industrial and commercial users are billed&#13;
on the basis of metered consumption. Interest is charged on late payments at 1 % per day but this is&#13;
currently less than inflation and arrears are very high. Due to inadequate financial management and&#13;
revenue administration practices, inform,ation on financial performance is incomplete and unreliable.&#13;
Performance&#13;
9.           Service Quality. The production and distribution facilities of Kommunpromvod are in&#13;
a state of severe degradation caused by the virtual absence, over the past two decades, of expenditure for&#13;
asset maintenance and replacement. Also, due to the lack of systematic planning of network extensions,&#13;
exacerbated by the lack of adequate financial resources, the distribution system is poorly configured.&#13;
10.          Based on western standards, the total design capacity of water production exceeds needs&#13;
by a factor of about two. In spite of this, the supply of water to consumers is unreliable and services are&#13;
provided for only part of the day. Estimated water losses from leakage, illegal connections, and wastage&#13;
amount to as much as 70 percent of production. Because of low pressures in the distribution system,&#13;
consumers living in elevated parts of the city or on top floors of apartment buildings frequently have no&#13;
services at all. Also, it is suspected sewage inflow through leaks in the distribution network causes&#13;
contamination of drinking water. Mortality from waterborne diseases, especially among children, is high,&#13;
and in 1993 Baku experienced an outbreak of cholera which was ascribed to the poor condition of the&#13;
water system. A recent survey indicates that 90 percent of the population do not consider the water to&#13;
be clean and 75 percent boil their drinking water.&#13;
11.          Financial performance. In many respects Kommunpromvod's finances are marked by&#13;
difficulties common to water enterprises in many former command economies. Due to an inadequate&#13;
billing system, undercharging consumption by a large margin, politically determined tariffs, and&#13;
inefficient revenue collection, operating income currently just covers cash expenses, without allowance&#13;
for maintenance. Although recently tariff increases for water charges leave tended to keep pace with&#13;
inflation, taken over a longer period tariffs have decreased sharply in real terms. The accounts receivable&#13;
turnover ratio is low, as a result mainly of problems in collecting revenue from government offices and&#13;
state enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;

BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CORPORATIZATION PARTNER&#13;
12.          Low  revenue levels are not offset by government transfers of any significance.&#13;
Kommunpromvod receives only very limited funds for capital expenditure. Also, operating expenses are&#13;
severely under-recorded as Ministry of Finance regulations prevent Kommunpromvod from property&#13;
depreciating its assets.&#13;
Apsheron Regional Water Company (ARWC)&#13;
13.          As stated earlier, the Government has recently approved and promulgated a decree&#13;
creating the Apsheron Regional Water Company (ARWC), a joint stock company which will own and&#13;
operate the water production and distribution system and other assets formerly owned and operated by&#13;
Kommunpromvod and its subsidiaries. Initially the company will be 100% owned by Government but this&#13;
may be reviewed in the future. The intention is to give the water company financial and managerial&#13;
independence.&#13;
14.          To facilitate both the transfer of Kommunpromvod operations to the ARWC and the&#13;
implementation of an investment program, a Corporate Development Unit (CDU) is being, established&#13;
within ARWC. The primary responsibilities of this unit are:&#13;
a.    to facilitate the establishment and development of the ARWC;&#13;
b.    to facilitate the transition to a new corporate structure and improve operational and&#13;
financial performance; and&#13;
c.    to manage all aspects of the implementation of the improvement program.&#13;
Status of Project Development&#13;
15.          The Government signed a contract in June 1994 with the consulting firm, Brown &amp; Root,&#13;
to prepare an emergency project for financing urgently needed improvements to the water supply for&#13;
Baku. Copies of the latest reports prepared under this contract may be obtained locally and provide&#13;
detailed additional background information. However, following discussions with Government and&#13;
appraisal by the World Bank and the EBRD, changes in the investment program have been made. These&#13;
have placed greater emphasis on the problems of household wastage and leakage and on providing an&#13;
effective and immediate response to the many bursts and leaks from which the distribution network&#13;
suffers.&#13;
16.          In relation to the institutional development program, it has been agreed that the CDU will&#13;
be assisted in its work by the CP who will be contracted to provide the support and services detailed in&#13;
these terms of reference.&#13;
II. Objectives&#13;
17.          The primary objective of the CP is to assist the CDU in meeting its objectives and&#13;
discharging its functions. Specifically, the objectives of the CP are to:&#13;

(vi)   analysis of personnel; and&#13;
(vii)   management of key functions,&#13;
b.    assist the CDU in preparing a Personnel Development Plan (PDP) for the staff of&#13;
ARWC. This will include an analysis of the staff employed, their age, experience,&#13;
qualifications etc. and a plan for developing those staff to meet the needs of the&#13;
organization. This may include training, job rotation or personal development&#13;
counselling. Where it is apparent that the necessary skills are not, or will not, be&#13;
available, a program of replacement and/or recruitment will be required.&#13;
c.    assist the CDU in preparing a strategic plan for water services (initially, the strategic plan&#13;
will be for water services only but with time may evolve into a more detailed plan with&#13;
a complete program of improvements, including sewage services). The strategic plan&#13;
should contain, inter alia:&#13;
(i)    a description of the Company's assets, their location, condition, capacity and&#13;
performance;&#13;
(ii)   an assessment of the demands to be satisfied and the standards (both internally&#13;

to inform all employees of what the ARWC is trying to achieve, how this is to be done,&#13;
what their part in achieving the ARWC's objectives is and how the ARWC will help&#13;
them to do this; and&#13;
f.    assist CDU in the implementation awareness program for customers concentrating&#13;
initially on those domestic customers who will be affected by the household leakage and&#13;
metering campaigns.&#13;
Skills Transfer in Water Utility Management&#13;
21.          The CP has the task of not only providing an immediate input into water utility&#13;
management, operational, and financial skills, but also to ensure that these skills are transferred to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;

staff of ARWC. In addition to on-the-job skill transfer, the CP will arrange for more formal training in&#13;
Azerbaijan or the home office of CP.&#13;
22.           The CP will arrange formal training in Azerbaijan for staff at all levels in ARWC in all&#13;
aspects of water utility management and operations. The nature, content and timing of this training will&#13;
be agreed with ARWC by January 1, 1996 and the training will commence before April 1, 1996. It is&#13;
envisaged that the CP will undertake some urgent training of key personnel relating to the initial&#13;
components of the improvement program and the management of the financial aspects of the program&#13;
before the main training begins. This will be separately agreed with ARWC. A total 20 man months&#13;
of training time for specialist trainers has been allowed. The CP will set out provisional proposals for&#13;
this training in his bid.&#13;
23.           CP will arrange for formal and informal on-the-job training for three members of ARWC&#13;
at the home office of the CP. It is envisaged that ARWC will select, in consultation with the CP, three&#13;
members of staff, one engineering, one operations, and one finance, from the middle levels of the&#13;
organization who are thought to be most likely to gain from the experience and produce the greatest&#13;
benefit to the Company. The three selected members of staff will each undertake a continuous period&#13;
of four months training at the same time from September to December 1995. Part of this training will&#13;
be common to all three and part specific to their own discipline. The CP will set out his proposals for&#13;
this training in his bid and will show how much is to be formal and how much on-the-job. The aim will&#13;
be to build upon the knowledge and skills possessed by the trainees and to show them best practice in&#13;
their field in a modern utility.&#13;
24.          The CP will arrange for informal training for three senior managers from ARWC at the&#13;
home office of the CP for a continuous period of three weeks each early in 1996. In this case, the three&#13;
members of staff will attend at different times. The CP will set out proposals for this training in his bid.&#13;
The aim will be acquaint each manager with a broad knowledge of best practice in their field in a modern&#13;
utility.&#13;
Management of the Improvement Program&#13;
25.           Although project implementation is the responsibility of the ARWC, the CP will play a&#13;
leading role in program implementation, given the lack of experience in managing an investment program&#13;
of this nature. The CP will advise and assist the CDU in all aspects of the successful delivery of the&#13;
improvement program which will include, inter alia, procurement, financial management, monitoring and&#13;
supervision, and reporting.&#13;
26.           Procurement All advice given on procurement matters shall be impartial, and be based&#13;
on the principles of economy, efficiency, quality and transparency and will include:&#13;
i.    review the arrangements for the procurement of the first components of the&#13;
improvement program (i.e. the vehicles, plant, equipment and materials, and the&#13;
contracts for the rehabilitation of treatment works and major pumping stations)&#13;

27.           Financial Management The CP will assist in establishing and implementing mechanisms&#13;
for financial operation, control and monitoring, including project accounting systems, procedures for&#13;
payment of contractors, assistance in preparation of project audits;  assist in making drawdown&#13;
applications, and preparing the appropriate documentation required for drawdowns by IDA and EBRD.&#13;
and, to establish financial reporting systems meet the requirements of IDA and EBRD.&#13;
28.           Monitoring and Supervision The CP will assist in preparing the implementation plar&#13;
setting out a detailed timetable for the entire program; develop systems for, and assist in carrying out.&#13;

which will satisfy the requirements of IDA and EBRD.&#13;
The Corporate Development Plan (CDP)&#13;
30.          The CP will prepare a CDP which will integrate the key development activities necessary&#13;
to make ARWC a modern, efficient, cost effective and customer oriented water company. The CDP will&#13;
provide the focus for the technical assistance to be given under the CP and provide an opportunity for&#13;
all the participants - Government, ARWC, the lenders and the CP - to set down the contribution they will&#13;
make and against which they will be monitored.&#13;

ANNEX D&#13;
Pane 8 of 16&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CORPORATIZATION PARTNER&#13;
31.          It is proposed that the CDP should include, but not be limited to:&#13;
a.    corporate aims - mission statement, objectives, targets and milestones;&#13;
b.    structure and organization of the ARWC;&#13;
c.    transition measures;&#13;
d.    a human resources development and training program;&#13;
e.     a strategic plan for water and sewerage services;&#13;
f.    a detailed capital investment program including the improvement program and proposals&#13;
for a second phase program;&#13;
g.    an information strategy identifying information requirements across all areas of the&#13;
business of ARWC, the proposals for collecting this information and the systems required&#13;
to utilize it;&#13;
h.    internal and external awareness programs; and&#13;
i.    performance measures through which the implementation of the plan can be monitored&#13;
and controlled.&#13;
32.          The CDP should be viewed a rolling plan which should evolve with time to reflect&#13;
changing circumstances, improved information and progress made. The first Plan, CDP '96 should be&#13;
completed by October 31, 1995 allowing two months before the full take up of operational activities on&#13;
January 1, 1996. It will be at a high level reflecting the time available for its preparation and the quality&#13;
of existing information.  It should, however, be sufficiently detailed to form  the basis for the&#13;
establishment of the new organization, ensure that it is operating as effectively as possible from the start&#13;
and, most important, it should set out the key areas for action and improvement in the following year.&#13;
33.          The preparation of subsequent plans will begin at the start of April of each year with a&#13;
review of the previous year's plan. The new plan will be finalized by the end of September. Thus, CDP&#13;
'97 will be completed by the end of September 1996, allowing 3 months for discussion and approval by&#13;
all the parties before implementation begins on January 1, 1997.&#13;
34.          It is envisaged that within the plan, some components will develop at different rates.&#13;
Thus, while the plan for water services may not be fully complete by 1998, the personnel development&#13;
program and the implementation plan must be completed well before CDP '97 is prepared.&#13;
35.          The first plan, CDP '96, will cover the period to December 31, 2001, i.e., some five year&#13;
after the completion of the CP. Subsequent plans will retain the same end date so that, with the&#13;
completion of CDP '99 in 1998, ARWC will have a refined and detailed plan covering the five years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

following the CP. Thereafter, it is envisaged that plans will be rolled forward annually covering the next&#13;
five years.&#13;
36.          The plan should include performance measures against which the implementation of the&#13;
plan can be monitored and controlled. Performance against these measure will be reported in the plan.&#13;
Initially these measures will be limited to the delivery in terms of time and cost of components of the&#13;
improvement program and to the achievement of the covenants specified by IDA and EBRD. Subsequent&#13;
plans should include measures of cost-effectiveness and quality of service in key areas of activity.&#13;
Staffing of the CP&#13;
37.          The CP's team will consist of four long term experts, four short term experts and a&#13;
number of specialist trainers. It is an essential quality that members of the CP's team use their own skills&#13;
and experience to seek out the most appropriate way in which the can assist the ARWC rather than follow&#13;
a detailed specification. The requirements set out below should be regarded as guidelines a to the&#13;
minimum which is expected and the basis on which the bid is prepared. The proposed time periods may&#13;
be subject to review when the detailed implementation plan for the improvement program is known. The&#13;
Corporate Partner may also wish suggest amendments.&#13;
38.          Each member of the CP's team should be a leading professional in his or her sphere wi,h&#13;
considerable experience in a water utility. Overseas experience will be particularly valuable. IL is&#13;
strongly recommended that at least one long term expert should have a knowledge of Russian, Turkish&#13;
or Azeri. Equally important is the ability and willingness to transfer their experience and knowledge to&#13;
others and the flexibility of approach which will enable that to be done in a different cultural background.&#13;
39.          Water Utility Management Expert The detailed tasks, requirements, and timing of the&#13;
required experts are described below:&#13;
a.    provide overall direction and coordination of the Corporate Partner's team;&#13;
b.    help the CDU to prepare a Human Resources Development Plan, a Strategic Plan for&#13;
water services, proposals for the next stage of asset improvements, an awareness program&#13;
for staff, and an Information Strategy;&#13;
c.    help the CDU to prepare a Corporate Development Plan which integrates the activities&#13;
and outputs of the CDU and CP team;&#13;
d.    help the CDU to monitor progress against the CDP and advise on appropriate corrective&#13;
action where necessary;&#13;
e.    help the CDU to develop proposals for a longer term partnership with an experienced&#13;
utility which will provide for reimbursement on the basis of the achievement of specified&#13;
objectives; and&#13;

ANNEX E&#13;
Page 1 of 7&#13;
BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS&#13;
1.           The Greater Baku Water Authority (Kommunpromvod--BWA) was established by charter&#13;
in 1989 to provide water supply to the Baku Metropolitan Area and the Aspheron Peninsula. It also&#13;
provides bulk water supply to Sumgait and numerous other settlements along the length of the Kura&#13;
transmission mains. The distribution system in Baku is operated by a subsidiary of BWA, the Baku Water&#13;
Distribution Company (Bakvodoprovod--BWD), established in the early 1960s, which operates nine&#13;
subdepots in the major districts of Baku.&#13;
2.            The headquarters and key managers of the Baku Water Company and its subsidiary, the&#13;
Baku Water Distribution Company, are located in a small building in the central part of the city.&#13;
Management is characterized by a top-down style inherited from the previous Soviet system, with all&#13;
decisions centrally controlled and micromanagement pervasive. On the other hand, many of the key&#13;
administrative and financial functions of these companies are handled by offices scattered across&#13;
metropolitan Baku, which is the consequence of inadequate space at the headquarters facility. Generally&#13;
there is extremely limited collection and reporting of information vital to the commercial management&#13;
of the water company and ineffective enforcement of collection of arrears. The authorities are instead&#13;
forced to spend much of their time responding to the latest crisis in the water supply and distribution&#13;
system.&#13;
3.           The nine subdepots of BWD show a full staff complement, including a manager, two&#13;
senior supervisory engineers, a personnel officer, payroll clerk, cashier, technical teams of three to four&#13;
people, and field personnel at pumping stations and workshops (often nearly one-third of total staff). The&#13;
lines of reporting are idiosyncratic (basically technically rather than managerially oriented), and hiring&#13;
often mirrors social realities of the past and present (pensioners comprise most of the laborers at the&#13;
pumping stations and in the workshops, and some returning veterans of the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict&#13;
have been hired).&#13;
4.            Operationally, large water main bursts remain unrepaired close to district headquarters&#13;
(some of which are controlled by makeshift dikes), which underscores the inadequacy of the water&#13;
company to address even the most obvious leaks a few yards from its own facilities. There are also&#13;
numerous and clearly visible illegal water connections into urban communities, including near reservoirs&#13;
in Greater Baku. This points to a severe lack of institutional capacity and responsiveness at the most basic&#13;
operational level. Clearly, commercial operations are impossible under these chaotic circumstances.&#13;
Moreover, rusted generators and miscellaneous, mostly unusable spare parts litter workshop grounds, and&#13;
most buildings are dilapidated, underdimensioned, and should to be razed. Many personnel appear to be&#13;
idle, awaiting the next emergency repair they will be unable to effectively make because they lack the&#13;
means to do so.&#13;
5.           The reason for this deplorable state of affairs is readily apparent: inadequate,&#13;
inappropriate/inoperable, or (usually) nonexistent equipment; an inability to coordinate even the little&#13;
existing capacity effectively; and a dramatic need for comprehensive technical and managerial training&#13;
throughout BWA, which will be required to restore order to the water sector of Greater Baku. All of the&#13;
foregoing renders the institutional incapacity of BWA an issue of considerable social significance as well.&#13;
This is attested to by the findings of a recent social survey conducted by the Bank, which found all&#13;
socioeconomic strata equally willing to pay significantly higher water tariffs to obtain reliable potable&#13;
&#13;

water in their residences.&#13;
6.           Transitional issues include: constituting the Corporate Development Unit (DU) to oversee&#13;
and participate in project implementation; corporatization of BWA/BWD into a new entity--the Apsheron&#13;
Regional Water Company; obtaining a new headquarters building (already identified); selection of a&#13;
twinning partner to rationationalize administrative and operational policies and procedures--the process&#13;
of which is underway; strengthening of the executive and middle management tier in the early stages of&#13;
the project; ongoing training associated with technical improvements (new equipment, techniques);&#13;
development of a human resources strategy in consonance with the evolving skill requirements of a&#13;
reconstituted water company; phasing of organizational restructuring and related training over the life of&#13;
the project.&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE&#13;
7.           The BWA is run by a chairman (CEO) who reports to the Minister of Housing and&#13;
Communal Property--although there are other governmental actors involved in the operations of the&#13;
sector. In many countries, the only contact the water service has with the government is through the&#13;
parent ministry. And in fully commercialized water suppliers government contact is the same as for any&#13;
other private sector business. In Baku management of water resources is spread across a number of&#13;
bodies, including the mayor of the city, the State Committee of Natural Resources, Department of&#13;
Geology, Committee of Irrigation, Azvod Canal, and the Institute of Water Problems. There is always&#13;
the potential for a conflict of interest and decisionmaking among these various entities.&#13;
8.           Four deputies (department heads) report to the CEO of BWA: the Deputy for Finance and&#13;
Administration (accounting, salaries, budget, security, personnel, and administration); a First Deputy&#13;
responsible for technical areas, including safety, metering and sales, as well as the subsidiary Baku Water&#13;
Distribution Company; a First Deputy in charge of the Water Institute (the planning and design group),&#13;
transport and mechanization, the Vodostroy Trust, and a Board that oversees construction of water supply&#13;
facilities; and a Deputy in charge of water treatment at Kura, Jeiranbatan, Hachmas, Tagiev, and&#13;
Sangachal. Branches of BWA are in the same locations as the water treatment sites just listed. In addition,&#13;
there are offices of Water Meters and Customer Accounts; Construction; and Purchasing and Stores.&#13;
9.           The Water Distribution subsidiary, BWD, reports to the First Deputy for Technical&#13;
Services in BWA. Each department has a manager responsible for the areas of: Administration; Customer&#13;
Accounts; Personnel; Vehicle Maintenance; Booster Station Operation and Maintenance; Customer&#13;
Accounting; Mechanical and Technical Operations (Chief), and Security; Network Repair Center; and&#13;
Laboratory (divisions of Bacteriology, Sampling, Physical Chemistry, and Radiation).&#13;
10.          There appear to be three personnel groups: one reports to the chairman of the BWA;&#13;
another is part of the First Deputy for Finance and Administration; and the third is for the subsidiary&#13;
distribution company (BWD).&#13;
11.          No clear operational basis for decisionmaking exists between BWA or BWD. In fact, they&#13;
operate independently of each other despite the organizational dependency of BWD on BWA. Although&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;

BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS&#13;
there are grade levels within job categories and differentiated functions, it difficult to ascertain with&#13;
precision individual roles and responsibilities, since the company is unable to meet minimum water system&#13;
needs. The lack of adequate delineation of responsibilities by position and the absence of formal&#13;
management structures and relationships greatly reduce the potential for efficient operations. Under&#13;
current circumstances, staff must use initiative and ingenuity to maintain and operate, even in a marginal&#13;
way, essentially obsolete plants and a technically defective, undermanaged water supply and distribution&#13;
network.&#13;
12.          The sanctioning of expenditures and requests for finance can, in cases of large amounts,&#13;
require the approval of the Housing Committee, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy,&#13;
Cabinet of Ministers, the mayor of Baku, and the National Bank. At any stage agreements can be&#13;
rescinded giving rise to a reinitiation of the process from the beginning. The Housing Communes are able&#13;
to frustrate the debt collection process by appealing to the mayor, who has significant power to overrule&#13;
business decisions made by the officials of BWA.&#13;
13.          In summary, the complexity of organizational relationships and the lack of clear lines of&#13;
authority over policy and operations create an environment where the basic functions of the Baku water&#13;
supply and distribution system, technical problems notwithstanding, can easily be paralyzed.&#13;
HUMAN RESOURCES ISSUES&#13;
14.          Staff Complement.    The Baku Water Authority (Kommunpromvod) employs about&#13;
3,600 people. The production unit employs a staff of about 2,400 and its subsidiary Baku Distribution&#13;
Unit (Bakvodoprovod) employs a staff of 1,200. Hiring of staff and grading systems involve the Housing&#13;
Communes and the Ministry of Employment, and on occasion the Cabinet of Ministers.&#13;
15.          Educational Levels. The four basic categories of staff are: engineers/technicians, clerks,&#13;
skilled (lower-level technicians) and semi- and unskilled workers. Generally, the engineer/technicians&#13;
require formal degrees or the equivalent. Skilled workers must have attended a technical institute and&#13;
obtained relevant practical and technical skills appropriate for their job. Similarly, clerks must be trained&#13;
sufficiently before employment. The greatest number of staff are skilled workers. At the top of their pay&#13;
band, they receive a salary equivalent to a beginning engineer/technician. Currently, no rniddle&#13;
management or supervisory designation exists in the organization.&#13;
16.          Management Approach. One of the greatest challenges to the water utility currently is the&#13;
proposed transition from the pyramid style of management to that of a corporate style. Directors and&#13;
senior managers, middle managers and foremen of the utility will be required to gain a wide range of&#13;
skills to enable them to carry out their duties in an effective and efficient manner. The aim of the&#13;
proposed training is to further broaden the experience of managers/supervisors at all levels in current and&#13;
anticipated assignments under the project.&#13;
Training and Development&#13;
17.          Over the years the training and development functions of the BWA have steadily declined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS&#13;
Currently, there is little or no training carried out by the utility. As a result, human resource development&#13;
is at a virtual standstill. The situation is further aggravated by a general lack of tools and equipment.&#13;
18.          Training is coordinated through the Ministry of Housing and Community Property (MOH)&#13;
and not the BWA. The MOH selects the number and category of personnel to receive training and which&#13;
programs are to be reviewed annually. Training is carried out by the senior staff at the BWA or other&#13;
ministries within their respective organizations. None of the staff involved in the delivery of training&#13;
receive training as trainers.&#13;
19.          When utility personnel begin their employment they are issued a written outline of their&#13;
responsibilities, a copy of which is then placed in the employee's personnel file. Quarterly performance&#13;
reviews are conducted for all staff. There are opportunities to apply for vacancies within the organization.&#13;
And staff may apply for posts outside their current occupational category. Turnover is low because there&#13;
is the expectation of permanent employment, which was generally the case under the previous political&#13;
system.&#13;
20.          There is external influence on pay levels and the number of staff employed. If this is not&#13;
addressed, it will become a major constraint to obtaining efficiency gains anticipated under the project.&#13;
The organizational transition program will need to be sensitive to develop appropriate ways to refocus&#13;
the current management culture.&#13;
Administrative Issues&#13;
21.          The key procedural/administrative bottlenecks confronting the water sector in Greater&#13;
Baku are the following.&#13;
a.    Management of Information. Management information is extremely limited. There are&#13;
no computing facilities, recordkeeping is done manually, and there are few standardized&#13;
forms. Also, photocopying capacity is limited.&#13;
b.    Billing System. Only two computers are used in the billing system. And computer&#13;
memory limitations permit only one month's records to be stored. Information on&#13;
outstanding accounts receivable is not available and billing totals on reports supplied&#13;
cannot be reconciled with supporting detail.&#13;
c.    Budget Recordkeeping. Quarterly budgets are prepared by both the Greater Baku Water&#13;
Authority and the Baku Water Distribution Agency. These budgets are compared with&#13;
actual expenditures but little information on the results are routinely communicated to&#13;
management. Analysis of BWA for the nine months ending September 30, 1994 showed&#13;
wide budget variances ranging from 1,489% positive to 439% negative.&#13;
d.    Accounting System. The financial system is a cash-based, double-entry manual system&#13;
that each department of the organization maintains independently from the others, with&#13;
a subsequent lack of standardization. The balance sheets are then consolidated quarterly&#13;

by the central accounting staff but with uncertain internal consistency.&#13;
e.     Metering. Approximately 80% of consumer meters are inoperative, there is no meter&#13;
maintenance/replacement policy, and meter calibration facilities do not exist.&#13;
f.    Tariff Setting. There are no working bulk flow meters in the system. Therefore quantities&#13;
of water supplied are not known and figures may be manipulated to suit a wide range of&#13;
scenarios. This seriously compromises the ability to manage the water system and&#13;
rationalize tariffs.&#13;
22.   Maintenance, Repair, and Customer Service Issues&#13;
a.    Maintenance. There is no asset registration within the organization and no maintenance&#13;
schedules. Moreover, maintenance is performed on a fire- fighting basis. It is severely&#13;
limited in scope for lack of spare parts due to age of the equipment, obsolescence, and&#13;
financial constraints. In the distribution system the quality of pipe materials and repair&#13;
methods used result in many leakage repairs being only temporarily successful, requiring&#13;
repeat visits sometimes after very short intervals.&#13;
b.    Repairs. Central workshops for mechanical plant repair and vehicle maintenance are well&#13;
organized. However, basic equipment, hand tools, and spare parts are in short supply,&#13;
which hampers productivity. Major repairs beyond the capability of these workshops are&#13;
subcontracted. Local workshops at the distribution depots, pumping stations, and&#13;
treatment works are severely limited.&#13;
c.    Customer Service. The Network Emergency Repair Unit has only one telephone manned&#13;
24 hours each day receiving customer complaints and dispatching road crews. Moreover,&#13;
there is no place for recording the number of calls, the number of customers without&#13;
service, or the time taken to respond to customer complaints.&#13;
Commercialization Issues&#13;
23.          The legal and political environment of the Greater Baku Water Authority affects in critical&#13;
ways the ability of the organization to adapt to changing circumstances and to reform its approach to&#13;
operate on a more commercial basis. For example, there are almost no guidelines that prescribe the&#13;
expected operation and performance of BWA; and there are no technical guidelines governing acceptable&#13;
customer service levels nor are there efficiency criteria established for the distribution system against&#13;
which to measure performance.&#13;
24.          The consequence of these factors is a series of interrelated institutional and technical&#13;
problems that will need to be addressed before the institutional capacity of the water sector in Greater&#13;
Baku can be modernized sufficiently to capitalize on the intended benefits from planned improvements&#13;
under the project.&#13;

25.          Legal Framework--(a) legislative changes will be required to reflect the changing role of&#13;
the BWA; (b) the Water Law being drafted will need to incorporate the organizational needs of the water&#13;
sector; (c) regulatory instruments will be required to facilitate the formation of a joint stock company,&#13;
whereby the Ministry of Housing grants to the Corporation the authority to provide water services; and&#13;
civil and legal codes to provide protection to water company property.&#13;
26.          Organizational--(a) the 1994 revision of the BWA charter needs to be successful in&#13;
streamlining the relationship with government departments; (b) the relationship with the Mayor of Baku&#13;
needs to be clarified within the organizational structure and fully understood by both parties.&#13;
27.          Financial--(a) many government-controlled organizations are not paying BWA for water&#13;
supplied; (b) the level of tax on profits of the water authority needs to be rationalized so as not to&#13;
handicap capital investment.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening Component&#13;
28.          Overview. The need for a twinning arrangement is clear, given the need to establish a&#13;
new institution based on international operational and administrative standards used by commercially&#13;
viable water companies. Twinning will need to be tailored to generate institution-building as an integral&#13;
part of the deployment of the Corporate Development Unit as well as direct involvement of those who&#13;
will become the future managers of the new water authority. At the same time, there is an imnmediate&#13;
need to train the executive management of BWA/BWD (now Aspheron Regional Water Authority--&#13;
ARWA) in management techniques, especially those pertaining to organizational change and transition&#13;
management. This need is paramount, since the CDU and senior management will be those charged with&#13;
the responsibility to subsequently train selected managerial candidates to take over the operations of key&#13;
departments in the new water company. Moreover, along with the twinning exercise and the training of&#13;
executive managers, there is a requirement to institutionalize the human resource, technical, and&#13;
managerial reforms contemplated over the life of the project. This will involve training all levels of&#13;
personnel, both at headquarters and in field offices in a well coordinated and targeted way. See Annex&#13;
D, Corportization Partner, for detailed Terms of Reference.&#13;
29.          Human Resource Strategy. The human resource development strategy is designed to&#13;
gradually transform the new ARWA into a modern, well-administered water company based on reliable&#13;
service and commercial viability. Because of the deteriorated state of the water sector and the company&#13;
to be reconstituted, as well the nature of the planned technical interventions, which initially will be labor&#13;
intensive, rationalization of the personnel complement will occur in synchrony with the leak detection and&#13;
repair program and the pumping station rehabilitation and network repair efforts. Hence, in phase one,&#13;
training provided by suppliers will occur simultaneously with the delivery of urgently needed equipment&#13;
to address immediate needs, which are widespread. At this time an initial screening by site supervisors&#13;
should take place to identify those most able to carry out the contemplated work during the first phase&#13;
of the project (years one and two). These supervisors will need to receive short-term training in&#13;
evaluating technicians and workers on the job, which skill can become an part of an ongoing field&#13;
supervisor role as the project evolves and the staff complement is thereby reduced.&#13;

30.          A preliminary analysis of subdepot facilities suggests that a reduction of over half (based&#13;
on level of between 70 to 120 employees) of current full-time staff might be possible based on systematic&#13;
attrition, i.e., pensioners currently employed given incentives to retire, staff who lack the requisite skills&#13;
transferred out of the sector or selectively retrained if needed, personnel replaced by technology and&#13;
network improvements, and moving duplicative administrative functions out of the subdepots into the&#13;
central administration.&#13;
31.          During phase two, the twinning partner will have been selected and begin to integrate into&#13;
the CDU and, in so doing, provide the requisite technical assistance to rationalize administrative and&#13;
commercial practices of the new water company. Further downsizing will occur as modem human&#13;
resources policies and procedures are established and implemented. The computerization of the ARWC&#13;
will require the complete range of associated training, since there are no computers and little evidence&#13;
of even typewriters. This will need to include basic keyboard skills, software packages, office&#13;
management skills, and reporting formats, among others. Once the support requirements are ascertained,&#13;
recruitment should take place to identify suitably prepared staff (including current staff) to meet staffing&#13;
targets. Additionally, managers will need to receive tailored computer skills training as well, from basic&#13;
keyboard skills to the use of management information systems and their specific application to enhance&#13;
water company performance.&#13;
32.          Institutionalization of the Reforms. During phase three, the institutionalization of the&#13;
reforms should be taking place. Human resource policies should be implemented routinely and training&#13;
needed on an ongoing basis in place. This will require the establishment of a Human Resources and&#13;
Training Unit within the water company or, at a minimum, the coordination and contracting with external&#13;
sources for training that can provided cost-effectively. See Annex D for Terms of Reference regarding&#13;
the development of such a unit, the human resource strategy, and institutional reforms under&#13;
corporatization.&#13;

BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
Environmental Overview and Evaluation&#13;
A. Project Impact and Environmental Rating&#13;
1.    The Baku Water Supply Rehabilitation Project, as an emergency project, is designed to address&#13;
urgent operational and administrative needs of the water sector. The project has been assigned a category&#13;
B rating. No significant environmental effects are anticipated other than a slight increase in vehicular&#13;
traffic in some parts of the city and some disruption in traffic flows caused by pipelines being replaced.&#13;
Mitigating measures will be taken to abate noise and dust from construction activities as well as to&#13;
redirect traffic so as not to impede normal flows unnecessarily or for extended periods. There will also&#13;
be a slight increase in sewage flows as a result of increased water pressure; however, the increase in&#13;
water supply in targeted areas and better water quality will offset this effect. A sewage operation is&#13;
planned as a second phase following implementation of the proposed rehabilitation project. The expected&#13;
operational and administrative improvements under the current project should quicken the pace of&#13;
implementing a subsequent operation to improve the sewage situation of the Apsheron Peninsula.&#13;
B. Synopsis of Environmental Issues&#13;
2.    The Apsheron Peninsula, which includes the capital city of Baku, is one of the three most&#13;
industrialized regions in the FSU. Its ecosystem is now replete with the residue and legacy of nearly a&#13;
century of environmental neglect. Importantly, this area is one of the oldest oil-producing regions in the&#13;
world. As a consequence of oil exploitation, as well as intense industrialization under the Soviets, the&#13;
surface and underground hydrosphere has caused 7,000 ha. of land to be polluted the Bay of Baku (with&#13;
environmental impact on those who live near the Bay or walk along its perimeter), and engendered&#13;
serious pollution of the Caspian Sea.&#13;
3.    In the water sector, wastes leaking from poor sewage network into the ground, industrial&#13;
contamination, generally inadequate water treatment, and unreliable water supply and distribution pose&#13;
serious social, health, even industrial problems. Most of the groundwater resources are contaminated by&#13;
industrial and municipal wastes dumped or discharged haphazardly. Only a small number of industrial&#13;
plants pretreat their effluent before discharge to the sewers. The majority discharge raw effluent that&#13;
jeopardizes the municipal sewage network and the biological treatment process at Govsani sewage works.&#13;
The source of pollution in the city water distribution network is the inflow of dirty ground water or cross-&#13;
contamination with the sewage.' The Baku Water Company for many years has lacked the means to&#13;
address any of the myriad of problems besetting the water sector in the Apsheron Peninsula.&#13;
4.     Large quantities of municipal and industrial wastes are discharged directly into the sea,&#13;
affecting the marine ecology and making the Bay of the Baku a biological dead zone, with several&#13;
consequences to the local health profile and the economy. Additionally, the rising level of the Caspian&#13;
'Lack of sewage network, made that in part of the city the surface water sewer have been converted into&#13;
sewage.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
sea is causing problems with ground water quality in many areas along the peninsula.&#13;
5.     The incidence of medically determined waterborne diseases in Baku remained relatively stable&#13;
over the last decade, ranging between 634 and 797 per 100,000 inhabitants, but with a significant&#13;
increase in 1993 to 985 per 100,000. This surge will need to be monitored given the recent outbreak&#13;
of cholera in the country. In two regions within greater Baku, Azbekov and Sabunhinsky, there is&#13;
direct relationship between water quality and epidemic diseases, where as much as 30 percent of the&#13;
population suffers from unacceptable water quality.&#13;
6.    In addition, many housing areas and settlements on the Peninsula lack proper sewage&#13;
collection and disposal facilities. In the absence of municipal sewage collection capacity, residents,&#13;
both individuals and groups, have installed private systems, which discharge wastes directly into the&#13;
nearest lake or ground soakway. Nearly 60 percent of Baku now lacks an appropriate sewage system.&#13;
7.     A further problem pertains to health care institutions themselves, which directly discharge&#13;
unsterilized wastes into the municipal sewage network. None of the 92 hospitals and 11 medical&#13;
institutes in the Baku area are equipped with adequate facilities for treatment of their wastes before&#13;
discharging into the water and sewage network.&#13;
8.     Finally, there is a notable absence of realistic environmental standards and enforcement&#13;
mechanisms. Although the Soviets developed rigorous standards, evidence suggest thy were seldom&#13;
applied. Over time several industries developed their own environmental bureaus that theoretically&#13;
monitored environmental impact; however, clearly self-policing has never worked. The result is&#13;
widespread lack of coordination of environmental policies and standards.&#13;
9.    Institutionally, ineffective structure stemmed from the past sectoral division of the countrv by&#13;
the ministries together with their institutional capacities, lack of coordination, political influence, and&#13;
lack of clear lines of responsibility. There are four agencies involved currently in environmental&#13;
monitoring and about 200 monitoring sites, including monitoring of the marine ecosystem, freshwater,&#13;
groundwater and atmospheric pollution. In the current austere economic climate, lack of resources has&#13;
seriously constrained all such activities, including research.&#13;
10.   Recently, the State Ecological Committee drafted a package of environrmental legislation that&#13;
incorporates international experience and concerns in the country. This legislation was submitted for&#13;
parliamentary action in the spring of 1994 and is still pending. Additionally, the National Sanitary&#13;
Board, in cooperation with the State Ecology Committee, has prepared a manual that would establish&#13;
national environmental standards, which also awaits parliamentary approval.&#13;
11.   The following discussion describes in detail the environmental problems facing Azerbaijan in&#13;
the project area, some of which will be addressed under the proposed loan.&#13;

BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
C. Overview of the Water Sector&#13;
Water Supply Sources and Quality&#13;
12.   Baku City and the Apsheron Peninsula are fed with water from three principal sources:&#13;
Shollar and Hachmas intakes, Jeiranbatan reservoir, and the Kura river. In addition, there is local&#13;
exploitation of ground water. For the public potable system, the water from the Shollar and Hachmas&#13;
intakes requires only chlorination. The water from Jeiranbatan reservoir and Kura river receives full&#13;
treatment at two large treatment works. There is no systematic collection of water quality data on&#13;
exploitation from ground sources. Available data from research studies confirmed a wide range water&#13;
quality depending on the source.&#13;
13.   Sources of drinking water supply include Shollar and Hachmas intakes, with a flow rate of&#13;
1.27 m3/s. They are named after towns located 180 km north of Baku. Both intakes are fed by&#13;
underground water of sediments of quaternary age represented lithologically by gravel and mixed&#13;
sands. The water bearing strata are protected against vertically migrating pollutants by relatively thick&#13;
clay rocks. The water from these intakes is fresh and meets national standards for potable water.&#13;
Mineralization ranges between 1-3 and 15-30 g/l and more. The water composition is chloride-&#13;
sulphate and chloride-hydrocarbonate sodium.&#13;
14.   The Jeiranbatan reservoir, situated 25 km north of Baku, is supplied by the Samuron canal,&#13;
built in 1956, with a total storage volume of 186.6 Mm3 and a useful storage capacity of 150.3 Mm3.&#13;
The Samuron canal carries freshwater originating in a mountainous area that is thinly populated, with&#13;
no large industries. After treatment, water quality meets national standards (GOST 2874-82). Solid&#13;
residuals range between 126426 mg/I, and total hardness from 2 to 14 mgeq/l. Among anions,&#13;
hydrocarbonates (177-647 mg/l) dominate over sulphates (32-236 mg/1) and chlorides (4-16 mg/1).&#13;
Last summer light algae blooms were observed in some areas of the reservoir, which confirmed&#13;
potential for airborne or agricultural pollution. The unfavorable location of the reservoir and lack of&#13;
buffer zone will need to be addressed to minimize this source of water pollution.&#13;
15.   Lack of reliable environmental monitoring data make estimation the scale and nature of Kura&#13;
river pollution extremely difficult to measure. There are many examples where estimations are too&#13;
general or contradictory. Lack of industrial and municipal treatment facilities in the river basin as&#13;
well as intensive agriculture production (cotton) in the river's upper reaches lead to the conclusion&#13;
that riverain water is polluted. The hydrochemical composition and quality of riverain water are&#13;
related to the intensity of industrial production, community infrastructure, and the type of agricultural&#13;
activity in the basin. Water that belongs to the sulphate-hydrocarbonate category of sodium or&#13;
calcium group, with very high natural turbidity, varies seasonally, ranging from 500 to 60,000 mg/I.&#13;
16.   Groundwater in the peninsula appears sporadically. In the western part, it appears in the&#13;
form of patches and in the east and around Baku it occurs everywhere at a depth of 1-30m. The&#13;
quality of water depends on the area, i.e, salinization typically varies between 1 to 50 g/l and more.&#13;
The best quality of water resources can be found near or in Bilga, Buzavna, and Mandakyan. Water is&#13;
poorly mineralised (1-3 mg/1) and reaches almost 90,000 m3/d.&#13;
&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
17.    As a consequence of the rise in the level of the Caspian Sea, in several areas in the east part&#13;
of the peninsula (e.g., Guzavny), water from the dikes has begun flooding settlements and arable&#13;
cultivated fields.&#13;
18.    Most of the groundwater resources are contaminated by industrial and municipal wastes&#13;
dumped or discharged in the area. The source of water pollution in the distribution system is inflow&#13;
of dirty ground water, accumulated due to bursts of sewerage and water supply pipes. Open-cast&#13;
mines and rubbish dumps filled with water are possible sources of pollution, not only for the&#13;
distribution pipework but for reservoirs as well. 2&#13;
Underground water that is unprotected from pollutants in the natural environment should only be used&#13;
by industries, which today is not the case.&#13;
19.    According to the results of a survey by the Baku Sanitary and Epidemiological Center, of 764&#13;
water samples taken from the distribution system in all 11 districts of Baku over a 9-month period in&#13;
1994, 24.6% do not meet state standards for potable water on bacteriological indices and 86.8% on&#13;
chemical analysis.3&#13;
Waste Water Collection and Treatment&#13;
20.    The City of Baku is served by a sewerage system most of which was constructed during the&#13;
1950s. About 1,300,000 m3/day has been estimated by the Baku Sewage Company as the total&#13;
quantity of sewage generated within the Baku administrative area. Other calculations indicate that the&#13;
quantity may be about half this amount, and that the per capita volumes of sewage generated are&#13;
about half of the values of official estimates.&#13;
21.    Nearly 60% of Baku is not provided with communal sewerage. Hence, waste water from&#13;
Azizbekov, Bingadi, Surachani, and the Nizami-Karadag region is discharged into lakes and pits in&#13;
the neighborhood. Only 70,000 and 17,000 in'3 respectively, of waste water (per day) are discharged&#13;
into Beuyk-Shor and Byul-Byul lakes; however, the water in four lakes-- Beyuk Shor, Byul Byula,&#13;
Ganii Gel and Krasnoye (southwest Baku)--is reported to be rising to dangerously high levels.&#13;
Houses in Amiradzhany, east of lake Byul Byula, have been flooded. According to the Baku Sewage&#13;
Company, the rise in water level is attributed to sewage inflows. 4&#13;
2 According to the State Ecological Committee, there is a significant problem with the operation of reservoirs&#13;
69 East, 69 West, and 110 East, which suggests the bacteriological pollution of the reservoirs.&#13;
I Maximum pollution with coloforms is registered in water from Surachami (46%), Azizbekov (36,9%),&#13;
Yasamal (32,4%) and Mazurani (22%) districts.&#13;
4 One pumping station has been constructed at lake Beyuk Shor to pump water out of the lake. Another one is&#13;
under construction to intercept inflows from the Binangadi area. Similar schemes are planned to reduce the water&#13;
level in lakes Buly Bulya and Ganii Gel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
22.   In the Baku area, pollution is also caused by health care institutions. There are 92 hospitals&#13;
and 11 medical institutes in the Baku area, and none of them is equipped with adequate facilities for&#13;
the sterilization of wastes before they are discharged into the sewage network. 5&#13;
23.   In the city, area the sewerage system and storm water systems have become partially&#13;
combined in response to the rainfall in some of the newer districts of the city, where surface water&#13;
sewerage is absent or inadequate to handle the sewage overflow. According to rough estimates, about&#13;
700 m3/day of untreated effluent is discharged into the sea. There are 50 outfalls discharging sewage&#13;
into the Bay of Baku, of which 19 are industrial, 17 are municipal and 14 combined systems, some of&#13;
them visible from the sea front promenade.6&#13;
24.    Several housing areas and settlements throughout the Apsheron Peninsula do not have proper&#13;
sewage collection and disposal facilities. In the absence of municipal sewerage, residents, either&#13;
individually or in community groups, have installed private systems. Sewage is discharged into the&#13;
nearest lake or a ground soakway. Settlements served by such sewerage facilities include: Binagadi&#13;
and Rasulzadi near lake Beyuk Shor, and Syul Byula, Surakhani, and Amiradzhany near Lake Byul&#13;
Byula.&#13;
25.    Another problem is created by 45,000 summer houses located on the Apsheron Peninsula.&#13;
Only a few of them are connected to the sewage network, while the others use septic tanks, allowing&#13;
wastes to penetrate the groundwater. Owners of those settlements either bring drinking water in&#13;
containers or drill their own wells and use local groundwater resources. Wastes are disposed of&#13;
illegally on land in the neighborhood.&#13;
26.    There are four sewage treatment plants serving the Baku administrative area: Govsani&#13;
(mechanical and biological) with a nominal treatment capacity of 600,000 m3/day; Zikh (mechanical)&#13;
with a treatment capacity 70,000 m3/day; Mardakan/Shuvelan (mechanical) with the treatment&#13;
capacity of 18,600 m3/day; and Khodzhasan with the treatment capacity of 18,600 m3/day. The total&#13;
nominal treatment capacity of the plants located in the Baku area is 707,200 m3/day.&#13;
Industrial Effluent&#13;
27.    The Apsheron Peninsula is one of the oldest oil producing regions in the world. As a result of&#13;
over a century of oil exploitation, the surface and underground hydrosphere has greatly changed. Oil&#13;
exploitation and its distribution has led to deterioration of soil and water caused by oil spills and oil&#13;
exploration activities. There are nearly 7,000 hectares of land polluted by the oil, with thickness&#13;
varying from 2.5 meters to 20 meters. This has led to flowage, underflooding, bogging, an increase&#13;
of abrasion processes, pollution of the Caspian Sea, and other deleterious effects. The absence of&#13;
I For example, the "Bolnica Semashko" hospital, which has an isolation ward, located in the central part of the&#13;
city, is equipped with a septic tank that has a capacity of 18,000 m3, with a daily discharge of 72 m3 of untreated&#13;
or sterilized wastes into the municipal wastewater network.&#13;
6 The map at the end of the annex shows the location of the municipal and industrial sewage outlets.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
a sewage network and treatment system and the lack of legal regulation and enforcement facilitates&#13;
dumping municipal and industrial wastes into the Apsheron Peninsula area and the surrounding lakes,&#13;
as discussed below.&#13;
28.    Many years of mismanagement practices in oil exploitation--e.g., cleaning of the pipelines&#13;
caused an accumulation of radionuclides (from radium-226, thorium-228, potassium 40) in the soil of&#13;
the Apsheron Peninsula. In some places, soils should be buried as radioactive waste. In the past, the&#13;
city of Baku together with the neighboring city, Sumgait, were among the leading industrial centers in&#13;
the Soviet Union, with a total production value of about 3.5 billion rubles in 1988. The following&#13;
types of industrial activity are represented in the area: petrochemical, metal processing, machine&#13;
building, pulp and paper, and food processing. Concentration of such industrial activities, in&#13;
conjunction with a total lack of environmental concern, resulted in tremendous environmental&#13;
devastation of the region caused by uncontrolled emissions and dumps.&#13;
29.    Officially, Baku has one disposal site for solid waste, in Balakhanskaya. For many years, no&#13;
precise measurements were taken of the quantity of solid industrial and domestic wastes, and currently&#13;
the area of dumping has not been estimated. The utilization, disinfection, and incineration of&#13;
industrial toxic wastes is extremely unsatisfactory.'&#13;
30.    A resolution was passed in 1979 instructing industry to pretreat effluents from all industrial&#13;
plants before they are discharged into the sewage system. A small number of industrial enterprises&#13;
pretreat their effluent before discharging it into the sewers. The majority discharge effluent without&#13;
pretreatment, and thus jeopardize the treatment processes at sewage treatment plants.&#13;
31.    A large number of artificial ponds and reservoirs appear on the surface as a result of waste&#13;
water discharge. At Biby-Eybat, a (main dumping area), about 140 reservoirs have appeared. The&#13;
ground water table in the area has risen five meters since 1940. Another problem is the deterioration&#13;
of the relict (glacial) lakes on the Apsheron Peninsula, with their tremendous biodiversity (Beyuk-&#13;
Shor, Byul-Byuly, Gadji-Gasan, Zykh, etc), which are now completely polluted.&#13;
Bay of Baku&#13;
32.   The location of the Bay of Baku, which fronts a densely populated area of the city with&#13;
promenades, theatres, restaurants, and crowded streets, makes the quality of its environment of&#13;
utmost importance. The high concentration of activities on the periphery of the Bay together with&#13;
heavy pollution creates an additional health hazard with the population of the Baku Metropolitan area.&#13;
33.   The Bay is heavily polluted by discharges from several industrial and municipal facilities.&#13;
The daily anthropogenic input on the Bay of Baku is estimated at about 500,000-700,000 m3 of&#13;
untreated sewage and industrial wastes discharged by 50 outlets located along the harbor and the bay&#13;
7 According to the State Ecological Committee, in 1993 alone, 80,000 tons of toxic wastes from industrial&#13;
activities accrued; and for the past 30 years, 15-20 million tons of solid domestic wastes was accumulated at the&#13;
city disposal site.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(see attached map).&#13;
34.   The bottom layer of water is heavily polluted by oil compounds (80-150 mg/i). As a result of&#13;
continuous oil spills, the sediments of the Bay are polluted by oil as well. Some estimations are from&#13;
2.9 to 4.5 million tons of oil substances have been deposited in the sediments of the 5-meter deep&#13;
bay. Also, there is a lack of benthic organisms in the central part of the bay, and there are&#13;
occurrences of zooplankton and fitobenthos on the stones. The bacterioplankton flora are dominated&#13;
by saprofits. The bottom part of the water is inhabited by anaerobic organisms or sedimentation&#13;
organisms.&#13;
35.    From spring until early autumn, anaerobic processes appear in the lower part of the bay of&#13;
H2S and ammonia. Biological life is represented by bacteria and zooplankton and fitobenthos&#13;
(diatomea) in the Shihowskij Plose area. In the bay, fish appear sporadically with a broad variety of&#13;
parasites and pathogenic changes on their bodies in form of red patches, ulcers, or genetic changes of&#13;
the organs.&#13;
D. Environment and Health Issues&#13;
36.    The main findings of the environmental analysis showed that low quality of drinking water&#13;
and related health risk are mainly caused by the poor condition of both water supply and sewage&#13;
systems in the city, which creates the potential for cross-contamination of the drinking water by&#13;
leaking sewage and industrial wastes.&#13;
37.    Lack of adequately designed special waste disposal sites, which would meet sanitary&#13;
requirements for toxic waste; damage to sewage pipes; the absence of sewerage in some districts of&#13;
Baku; poorly operated reservoirs and water distribution networks; and excessive air pollution--all&#13;
have aggravated the ecological situation of the Apsheron Peninsula and the City of Baku, and&#13;
negatively affected the health of the population. The total incidence of the medically determined&#13;
waterborne and water diseases in Baku has remained relatively stable over the last 10 years at&#13;
between 634 to 797 per 100,000 population, but with a significant rise to 985 in 1993.&#13;
38.   Whereas in the Baku diseases can be related to several causes, in the city of Sumgait there is&#13;
a clear link between diseases there and industrial activities. Some of the chemicals produced there are&#13;
carcinogens, especially chlororganic products such as hexachlorane, DDT, Lindane, etc. Others cause&#13;
severe birth defects and embriotoxic effects. On average, 27 out of 1,000 newborns do not survive&#13;
the first year and others are affected by numerous illnesses. On the other hand, the majority of&#13;
industrial plants in Baku or the Apsheron Peninsula have been developed without environmental&#13;
control equipment or adequate buffer zones.&#13;
39.   The only regions in Greater Baku where there is an evident relationship between the quality of&#13;
water and epidemic diseases are the Azbekov and Sabunhinsky regions, where it is reported that about&#13;
30% of the population suffers from unacceptable water quality.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
E. Environmental Institutions&#13;
40.   Degradation of the environment in the Baku Metropolitan area can be largely attributed to the&#13;
inherent inefficiencies of a centrally planned economy. Centralized, ineffective enforcement of&#13;
environmental laws and standards, an inefficient system of environmental management, and lack of&#13;
public participation in the process of environmental protection and management, has resulted in the&#13;
degradation of the environment.&#13;
41.   Most of the environmental issues described above result from lack of an environmental legal&#13;
and regulatory framework, including a permit system and appropriate industrial zoning. Improvement&#13;
of city planning based on realistic environmental standards and regulations is a matter of urgency.&#13;
42.   Environmental protection is currently under the supervision of the following institutions: State&#13;
Committee for Ecology and its 25 regional offices, which is placed under the authority of the Office&#13;
of the President; the State Committee for Hydrometerology; the Ministry of Agriculture; and the&#13;
Ministry of Construction. In addition, within the Ministry of Health, the Sanitary-Epidemiological&#13;
Authority is responsible for monitoring water quality relative to public health.&#13;
43.   There is a urgent need to upgrade the existing environmental monitoring system in two&#13;
respects: first, the Baku Water Company will need to monitor water quality in the reservoirs and&#13;
distribution system in the city; and second Hydromet will need to monitor the quality of the Kura&#13;
river Samuron channel. Lack of resources caused a recent reduction in existing potential to monitor&#13;
water quality.&#13;
44.   A significant amount of expertise and training will be required at all levels to strengthen the&#13;
enforcement capabilities for dealing with polluters who do not comply with the conditions established&#13;
by environmental permits and licenses.&#13;
45.   The environmental monitoring structure system in the Republic has been developed according&#13;
to the past sectoral administrative division of the country, which involves a number of ministries. In&#13;
the past, four institutions were responsible for environmental monitoring; the Water Management&#13;
Committee; Comwodhos; Goscomgeologija; and Azgoshydromet. All of them are now facing serious&#13;
problems caused by the lack of financial resources. The following institutions are additionally&#13;
involved in environmental monitoring and research:&#13;
*     Department of Water Supply and Canalization of the Azerbaijan Engineering Institute&#13;
No. 2. The Construction Institute--standards of drinking water for the industrial&#13;
sector;&#13;
*     "Azwodgeo", Water Treatment Laboratory--hydraulics of the municipal network;&#13;
*     International Ecoenergy Academy, Department of Water Ecosystems;&#13;
*     Oil Academy--water and wastewater treatment processes;&#13;
*     Laboratory for Water Treatment Technology; and&#13;
*     Committee on Hydrogeology and Geology of the Republic of Azerbaijan.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
46.   There are 200 monitoring stations (sampling points) in the Republic where samples are&#13;
analyzed in several mobile and central laboratories. According to the Committee on Ecology, these&#13;
laboratories have the capacity to analyze all the main parameters, excluding detergents and herbicides.&#13;
a.    Marine Monitoring. Nine vessels in service in 1990 under the; Hydromet,&#13;
Goskomecologia, Academy of Sciences, Yuzazrybwod; now only three of them are&#13;
partially involved in monitoring/research activity.&#13;
i.    Hydromet - two vessels and central stationary laboratory in Baku established&#13;
nine marine monitoring stations located along the sea coast. The measures&#13;
covered the following main hydrochemical parameters: oils, phenols,&#13;
detergents, oxygen, visibility, and temperature;&#13;
ii.    Goskomecologia - two vessels and central stationary laboratory in Baku&#13;
established monitoring stations focused mainly on oil pollution;&#13;
iii.    Academy of Sciences - lack of resources caused the cancellation of all&#13;
research cruises and no scientific activity will continue.&#13;
b.    Fresh Water Monitoring.. There are 28 permanent monitoring stations established by&#13;
the Hydromet service located at 20 sites along the Kura river, and 14 stations on the&#13;
lakes. The following main elements are analyzed: dissolved oxygen, BOD5, ammonia,&#13;
nitrates, nitrites, phenols, phosphorus, sulfates, hydrocarbons, detergents, Cu, Zn, Al,&#13;
Mn, Ti, Hg, and some pesticides;&#13;
c.    Groundwater. Geological Committee has established a grid of 46 monitoring stations&#13;
where the main water quality parameters are measured;&#13;
d.    Atmospheric Pollution. Monitoring of atmospheric pollution is done by the&#13;
Azerbaijan Hydromet. Available data show high levels of industrial discharges and&#13;
pollutants caused by vehicular transportation in the city of Baku.&#13;
F. Legal and Regulatory Framework&#13;
47.   Lack of adequate legal and regulatory framework in Azerbaijan creates an urgent need to&#13;
adopt a full package of environmental legislation and regulations that would supersede and update the&#13;
old and inefficient framework issued by the FSU. The legislation and regulations to be revised and&#13;
introduced should be transparent to all relevant parties, and should be easily enforceable.&#13;
48.   Currently, ambient standards for water, air, and soil quality are very stringent and not&#13;
compatible with the current institutional capacity of the environmental management system in the&#13;
country to encourage compliance. Adherence to those standards will either force continued&#13;
noncompliance, thereby weakening the credibility of environmental protection activities, or close&#13;

BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SPECIAL ACCOUNTS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.           In view of the evolving situation of the banking sector in Central Asia, a number of&#13;
minimum conditions should be met by banks to be selected to hold IBRD Special Account funds, as&#13;
specified below:&#13;
a.    financial soundness and stabilitv: the banks should have received a general operating&#13;
license from the Central Bank of Azerbaijan. Moreover, any bank selected for a Special&#13;
Account should be subject to an assessment by an IBRD Task Manager in consultation&#13;
with the Disbursement Officer to ensure that it meets adequate standards for financial&#13;
soundness.&#13;
b.    audit: the bank should have been audited by a recognized auditing firm for the past year&#13;
and the audit report must be found acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
c.    reasonable fees: even the most competitive banks charge high fees for each transaction,&#13;
although they claim to be making profits on the cash value of their operations rather than&#13;
on the number of transactions. However, they are ready to negotiate their fees down and&#13;
in some instances some of the banks were willing to waive their charges for the benefit&#13;
of holding IBRD Special Account funds.&#13;
d.    foreign correspondent bank network: the bank should have a significant network of&#13;
correspondent banks for all major currencies (USD, DM, FF, SWF, Pounds Sterling) and&#13;
the capacity to handle transactions with foreign banks on a routine basis. References on&#13;
an Azeri bank can be obtained from its correspondent banks abroad.&#13;
e.    full bankinz services: the bank should be capable of performing a wide range of banking&#13;
services (wire transfers to foreign banks, cash withdrawals, issuance of monthly Special&#13;
Account statements/debit notes, issuance of conversion rate).&#13;
as the Azeri banking system does not provide checks, small payments covering&#13;
operating cost will be covered by cash withdrawals. In some instances, the banks&#13;
may not be favorable to small cash withdrawals;&#13;
ii.    Azeri banks typically do not provide regular monthly statements to their&#13;
customers.  They provide debit notes only for the larger transactions.&#13;
Implementing agencies have been able to obtain monthly statements as required&#13;
by IBRD at an extra charge. In one instance, the statement was prepared by the&#13;
implementing agency and certified by the bank, which is not recommended under&#13;
IBRD rules.&#13;
f.    capacity to issue letter of credit: most banks have limited experience in issuing Letters&#13;
of Credit and even less so in obtaining Letter of Credit confirmations from foreign banks.&#13;
The size of the Letter of Credit department and the volume of operations handled should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX K&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SPECIAL ACCOUNTS&#13;
provide an indication as to the reliability of the bank in this respect.&#13;
g.    member of SWIFT: the bank should be a member of SWIFT (Society for Worldwide&#13;
Interbank Financial Telecommunications) and routinely use this facility to expedite&#13;
payment transfers.&#13;
h.    issuance of a Comfort Letter: to protect the interests of borrowers and the Bank, the&#13;
commercial bank should be willing to provide a letter of comfort to assure that amounts&#13;
deposited in a Special Account will not be set off or otherwise seized or attached to&#13;
satisfy amounts due to the commercial bank by the borrower. Such a letter is a&#13;
precondition for the Bank to disburse the initial authorized allocation.&#13;
i.    training/familiarity with Western banking practices: the staff from the foreign transactions&#13;
department should possess a good knowledge of the English language and should&#13;
normally have been trained by the former "Vnesheconombank" or by foreign commercial&#13;
banks abroad or in Azerbaijan.&#13;
j.     annual rePorts/statement of fees: a bank should be willing to provide information of this&#13;
nature, satisfactory of IBRD.&#13;
Selection Procedures&#13;
2.           It is recommended that the selection of a bank to hold a Special Account should be based&#13;
on competitive local shopping procedure. To initiate this process an implementing agency would send&#13;
to at least three commercial banks a letter inviting them to submit proposals. This should be done on&#13;
project by project basis and the bank's proposals would be tailored to the size of the Special Account&#13;
under each loan and possibly the borrowing sector. This procedure would best protect the interest of&#13;
borrowers in the long run as well as foster transparency and facilitate disbursement of loan funds. This&#13;
process will also provide the implementing agency with a written commitment from the bank, which&#13;
should result in better control of funds.&#13;
3.           A draft invitation to submit proposals with accompanying sample formats will be made&#13;
available to implementing agencies by the Bank's Resident Mission in Moscow for their guidance in the&#13;
selection of a Special Account bank. Although it is the borrower's responsibility to select the commercial&#13;
bank, the choice of bank must be approved by IBRD. Under these circumstances, the selection process&#13;
will be carried out as follows:&#13;
a.    as soon as possible after Board approval of the Loan, the implementing agency (provided&#13;
that it has been established) will send to at least three conmmercial banks (listed in par.&#13;
7 below) the letter of invitation to submit a proposal.&#13;
b.    the implementing agency head will establish a Selection Committee composed of at least&#13;
three parties (e.g. the PIU head, representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the&#13;
Central Bank). This committee will review the proposals and make its decision. If, with&#13;

prior approval of the Task Manager, no Selection Committee is formed, the selection and&#13;
accompanying conclusions made by the implementing agency should receive formal no-&#13;
objection from tlhe Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank.&#13;
c.    the head of the implementing agency will report the findings (together with no-objections&#13;
referred to above) to the Task Manager and state that they have assessed the depository&#13;
bank being nominated against the above criteria and are satisfied that it is an appropriate&#13;
choice for the Bank's consideration. The borrower should also advise the Task Manager&#13;
of their internal procedures governing the control and use of interest income earned on&#13;
the Special Account.&#13;
d.    IBRD will provide its approval on the basis of the above. The Task Manager should also&#13;
refer to (i) the September 8, 1993 "Report of the Working Group for Review of Special&#13;
Accounts" issued by the Loan Department and (ii) O.D. 12.20 in Special Accounts.&#13;
4.           Banks which are eligible to participate in selection procedure include:&#13;
a.    banks participating in the FIDP/ESP projects;&#13;
b.    banks designated by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance as eligible to hold&#13;
deposits of Government's funds; and&#13;
c.    banks which have been evaluated by the Bank's specialists and are most likely to provide&#13;
satisfactory banking services in regard to Special Accounts.&#13;
5.           Banks which previously have held Special Accounts and provided satisfactory services&#13;
(as ascertained by the Bank's staff and the borrower) will not be disqualified from continuing to hold the&#13;
Special Account (provided their performance continues to be satisfactory), but they will not be eligible&#13;
to hold additional Special Accounts unless they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Bank that they&#13;
have met the minimum criteria outlined in para. 4. Other local commercial banks may be considered&#13;
provided that the Task Manager and the Loan Department have concluded on the basis of submitted&#13;
documents that the bank meets the minimum criteria. However, banks which are not on the list approved&#13;
banks may not make more than one-third of the number of banks invited to submit proposals.&#13;
Agreement Regarding the Special Account&#13;
6.           In order to avoid potential misunderstanding regarding the term is of the Special Account&#13;
in the future, an agreement regarding such terms should be concluded between the implementing agency&#13;
(or PIU) and the bank, which, inter alia, should include:&#13;
a.    confirmation of the opening of the Special Account to be maintained in USD;&#13;
b.    account number;&#13;

BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A.    General Introduction&#13;
1.           This annex presents: (a) Konmunnpromvod's past and present financial position; and (b)&#13;
the assumptions and projections for ARWC's financial performance from 1995 to 2005.&#13;
B.    BWA's Past and Present Financial Position&#13;
2.           BWA's (Kommunpromvod) past and present financial performance is presented in three&#13;
tables covering:&#13;
(a)    Table 0.1 Kommumpromvod - Revenue and Expenditure Statement 1991-1994;&#13;
(b)    Table 0.2 Konmmunpromvod - Balance Sheet 1992-1994; and&#13;
(c)    Table 0.3 Kommunpromvod - Water Tariffs 1992-1995&#13;
C.    ARWC - Financial Assumptions and Projections 1995-2005&#13;
General&#13;
3.           The financial projections from 1995 to 2005 assume that ARWC's financial accounting&#13;
system will be improved to conform with accepted western commercial practices. The information&#13;
developed should also be fed into a regular management information system.&#13;
4.           All the financial projections are presented in US$ at current prices (i.e. including an&#13;
annual allowance for inflation) at the following rates: 2 percent 1995; 2.5 percent 1996; 2.7 percent 1997;&#13;
2.5 percent 1998; 2.6 percent 1999; and 2.7 percent per year thereafter.&#13;
Revenue and Expenditure Statement (Table 0.4)&#13;
5.           The total population, population served and water demand reflect the projections prepared&#13;
by the Project Consultants.&#13;
6.           It is assumed that ARWC will set water tariffs which will generate by 1998 revenues&#13;
equivalent to not less than the sum of: (a) total operating expenses; (b) debt service requirements; and&#13;
(c) provision for non-cash items, including depreciation and replacement costs.&#13;
7.           Revenue will be derived from continued direct charges on water consumers. In order to&#13;
satisfy the financial objective set out in Item 6 above, it is envisaged that average water tariffs would be&#13;
increased in terms of current prices by 40 percent in 1995, 25 percent in 1996, 20 percent in 1997, 15&#13;
percent in 1998, 10 percent in 1999 and 5 percent in 2000.&#13;

ANNEX N&#13;

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
8.           Operating expenses were prepared on the basis of two main sources of information: (a)&#13;
Kommunpromvod financial accounts for 1993 and 1994; and (b) estimates of the cost savings and&#13;
incremental costs attributable to the Project investment. The cost estimates for 1995 are based on the 4th&#13;
quarter 1994 and some of the latest unit prices. All costs have adjusted to current prices using the&#13;
inflation rates specified in Item 4 above.&#13;
9.           Salaries and wages include a social insurance contribution of 35 percent, employment fund&#13;
of 2 percent and refugee aid of 1 percent. Staffing of the water enterprise is projected to be reduced by&#13;
about 60 percent over the next 10 years. Therefore, in 1995 prices, the staff costs are expected to rise&#13;
from an estimated US$ 370,000 in 1995 to US$ 468,000 in 2000 and US$ 596,000 in 2005 - this includes&#13;
an annual adjustment of 15 percent per year to reflect productivity gains.&#13;
10.          Electricity - substantial savings are expected to accrue in annual electricity costs through&#13;
the reduction in non revenue water, improved system operation and higher pump efficiencies. The&#13;
projected values in 1995 prices are presented below based on the unit cost of electricity which has been&#13;
projected in line with the tariff requirements which were agreed recently as part of a loan agreement&#13;
between EBRD and Azerenerji (see: Azerbaijan - Yenikend Renewable Energy Project, Staff Appraisal&#13;
Report, EBRD, October 1994):&#13;

11.          Chemicals - the consumption of chemicals will decline in line with the projected reduction&#13;
in water production and non revenue water, from an estimated US$ 590,000 in 1995 to US$ 351,000 in&#13;
2000 and US$ 380,000 by 2000 - all in 1995 prices.&#13;
12.          Materials and Supplies are projected to increase in real terms at 10 percent per year for&#13;
the next five years from a base of US$ 455,000 in 1995.&#13;
13.          Repairs and Maintenance - repairs and maintenance costs consist of two components: (a)&#13;
projected increase in existing costs in real terms at 5 percent per year for the next five years from a base&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX N&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
of US$ 3.9 million in 1995; and (b) incremental maintenance costs on all new civil works plus machinery&#13;
and equipment to be financed by the proposed investment package. The latter costs are estimated as a&#13;
proportion of the capital cost: (i) civil works - 0.05 percent per year; and (ii) machinery and equipment -&#13;
1 percent per year.&#13;
14.          Administration - set at 2.5 percent of all other operating costs.&#13;
15.          Bad debts - set at 5 percent of total revenue in 1995 and 1996; 2.5 percent in 1997; and&#13;
1 percent thereafter.&#13;
16.          Depreciation allowances were calculated on the following bases:&#13;
(a)    Existing assets - according to Komimunpromvod's records, the existing fixed assets of the&#13;
water supply system had a gross book value of US$ 11.8 million as at 31st December&#13;
1994. The annual depreciation allowance used in the accounts yields a factor of 3.6&#13;
percent per year (equivalent to an average asset life of 28 years);&#13;
(b)    Project investments - for the new assets, the depreciation allowances were calculated on&#13;
a straight-line basis without annual revaluation, using the following asset lives:&#13;
40 years - civil works, pipes and pipework.&#13;
15 years - equipment and materials for mains repair, booster stations and the&#13;
rehabilitation of the water treatment plant and the pumping stations.&#13;
10 years - equipment and materials for household leakage, master meters, the new office&#13;
building, depots and stores.&#13;
5 years - vehicles; and equipment and materials for metering, billing system, consumer&#13;
education, laboratory and information systems.&#13;
17.          Interest Charges reflect the following onlending conditions:&#13;
(a)    IBRD/IDA - 7 percent interest rate with repayment over 25 years, including 5 years&#13;
grace;&#13;
(b)    EBRD - 7.5 percent interest rate with repayment over 15 years, including 3 years grace;&#13;
(c)    European Union - assumed to be on a grant basis to ARWC; and&#13;
(d)    Government contribution - treated as an equity investment.&#13;
18.          Profit Tax - set at 35 percent of net income.&#13;

Balance Sheet (Table 0.5)&#13;
19.          Accounts Receivable have increased as a proportion of billed revenue in terms of US$&#13;
in the last two years from 23 percent in 1993 to 26 percent in 1994. The level of arrears is likely to rise&#13;
in the short term and the following levels have been assumed in the financial projections: 40 percent in&#13;
1995; 35 percent in 1996; 25 percent in 1997; and 17 percent (i.e. 2 months of revenue) from 1998&#13;
onwards.&#13;
20.          Inventories set at 1.5 percent of fixed assets in operation from 1995 onwards.&#13;
21.          Long term debt consists of future borrowing less principal repayments. The conditions&#13;
for the international loans are set out in Item 17.&#13;
22.          Accounts Payable have increased as a proportion of operating expenses in terms of US$&#13;
in the last two years from 18 percent in 1993 to 32 percent in 1994. The following levels have been&#13;
assumed in the projections: 40 percent in 1995; 35 percent in 1996; 25 percent in 1997; and 17 percent&#13;
(i.e. 2 months of operating expenses) from 1998 onwards.&#13;
Sources and Application of Funds (Table 0.6)&#13;
23.          Loans represent borrowing from the international loans and the requirements of the&#13;
proposed investment schedule.&#13;
24.          Applications of capital expenditure represent the planned phasing of the proposed&#13;
investment programme (1995-2000).&#13;
25.          Debt service represents payment of the principal and interest due on the international&#13;
loans.&#13;

BAKU WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. General Introduction&#13;
1.           This annex presents the three main components of the economic analysis of the Baku&#13;
water supply project: (a) economic internal rate of return (EIRR); (b) average incremental cost (AIC) of&#13;
water; and (c) affordability calculations. Each component is presented separately below.&#13;
B. Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR)&#13;
2.           Introduction. All costs and benefits are expressed in US$ at 1995 constant economic&#13;
prices. The adjustments to economic border prices include the following shadow price factors: (a) foreign&#13;
exchange 1.05; (b) labour 0.80; and (c) a standard conversion factor 0.90. The border price for electricity&#13;
has been estimated separately (see Item 16 below).&#13;
3.           The economic life of the rehabilitation and improvement works is assumed to be 15 years&#13;
after the completion of construction and installation in 2000.&#13;
4.           Incremental Water Delivered. The incremental water delivered to the consumer has&#13;
been estimated on a "with" and "without" project basis. In the "with" project case, the projected water&#13;
delivered is presented on an annual basis in Annex 0, Table 0.4. In the "without" project case (i.e.&#13;
without the proposed rehabilitation and improvement package) the water supply system will continue to&#13;
deteriorate thereby reducing the volume of water available for direct consumption. It has been&#13;
conservatively estimated that water production will decline by about 1 percent per year unaccounted will&#13;
increase at the rate of 1 percent per year in the "without" project case.&#13;
5.           The difference between the "with" and "without" project cases represents the incremental&#13;
water delivered to the consumer which will be generated by the proposed investment package. Table P.2&#13;
indicates that the incremental water delivered will increase from a modest 3 million m3 in 1995, rising&#13;
to 25 million m3 in 1998, 55 million m3 in 2000 and 105 million m3 in 2002 - which is assumed constant&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
6.           Costs. Capital Costs - the capital costs of the proposed investment in Baku's water&#13;
supply system are summarized below in terms of financial and economic costs. The economic costs are&#13;
derived by applying the standard conversion factor to local costs and the shadow price factor for foreign&#13;
exchange. The results are as follows in US$ 000:&#13;

7.            Replacement Capital Costs - these have been included for the following: (a) every five&#13;
years: vehicles and equipment for consumer metering, billing system, consumer education, laboratory and&#13;
information systems; and (b) every 10 years: equipment for household leakage equipment, master flow&#13;
meters, the new office building, depots and stores. The resulting replacement costs are as follows in US$&#13;
000:&#13;

8.           Residual Values - given the fact that the discount period is 15 years and a number of the&#13;
proposed investment components have an asset life which is greater than 15 years - then there will be a&#13;
saving in residual costs which should be taken into account at the end of the discount period. These are&#13;
US$ 9.58 million in financial prices and US$ 9.36 million in economic prices.&#13;
9.           Incremental Annual Operations and Maintenance Costs - the incremental recurrent costs&#13;
attributable to the project are: (a) salaries and wages - based on an annual adjustment of 15% per year&#13;
to reflect productivity gains; (b) increased materials and supplies plus repairs and maintenance to ensure&#13;
that existing assets, new equipment and other improvements are adequately&#13;
maintained; and (c) higher administration costs (see Annex 0, items 9, 12, 13 and 14). The resulting&#13;
incremental costs are as follows in US$ 000:&#13;

Benefits&#13;
10.          The principle benefits have been quantified under three main headings: (a) willingness&#13;
to pay for an improved water supply service; (b) public health benefits through a reduction in waterborne&#13;
and water-related diseases; and (c) costs savings through a reduction in the annual recurrent costs of&#13;
operating the water supply system. These three components are addressed separately below.&#13;
11.          Willingness To l'ay - the Baku Social Assessment Survey 1994 clearly demonstrates that&#13;
households in the project area are willing to pay a much higher price for an improved water supply&#13;
system. The results of the survey indicate that in July 1994 households would be willing to pay a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
weighted average of US$ 0.065 per m3 (assuming that effective consumption is 150 liters per head per&#13;
day and a household size of 4.5 persons), which was 10-times higher than the domestic tariff of US$&#13;
0.006 per m3 in July 1994. However, this incremental percentage cannot be applied to the other consumer&#13;
categories, particularly industry which still receives priority in the allocation of water. Nevertheless, it&#13;
is not unreasonable to apply an incremental factor of 50 percent on domestic willingness to pay, because&#13;
of the risk that the level of non revenue water will continue to rise in the "without" project case (see Item&#13;
4 above) and therefore jeopardize the medium to long term recovery of local industry. On this basis, the&#13;
estimated overall willingness to pay is US$ 0.10 per ni3, which is then multiplied by the incremental&#13;
water delivered to derive the annual benefit estimates. The resulting annual value of willingness to pay&#13;
for incremental volumes of water in the "with" project case shows the total increasing from US$ 0.2&#13;
million in 1995 to US$ 5.5 million in 2000 and US$ 10.5 million in 2005 (see Table P.2).&#13;
12.          Public Health Benefits - The quantification of health benefits has been based on the&#13;
estimation of economic loss related to the incidence of waterborne and water-related diseases under&#13;
three main headings:&#13;
(a)    Value of lost production time due to illness. This is a loss incurred by the economy and&#13;
more especially by the family concerned. However, the real loss to the economy should&#13;
take account of the long-term rate of unemployment and under-employment;&#13;
(b)    Economic loss due to premature death; and&#13;
(c)    Economic cost of medical treatment.&#13;
However, in using basic health data several important factors should be borne in mind: (i) health statistics&#13;
are often inaccurate and subject to under-reporting; (ii) many people accept that they will contract the&#13;
milder forms of waterborne and water-related diseases, and do not consult a doctor or a health clinic,&#13;
particularly among low-income groups; and (iii) the incidence of filth-related diseases is generally more&#13;
prevalent among the lower-income groups.&#13;
13.          Basic data for the health benefit calculations were derived from three main sources: (a)&#13;
data provided by the Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Control in the Ministry of Health; (b)&#13;
Baku Social Assessment Survey (July 1994); and (c) investigations by the Consultants and the Bank&#13;
Mission. Many waterborne and water related diseases (e.g. typhoid, hepatitis, dysentery, gastro-entiritis,&#13;
cholera and others) are prevalent in the Baku area. They are a source of considerable distress, hardship&#13;
and even death for the citizens of Baku; and they are a significant cost to the national economy. The&#13;
notifiable cases of waterborne and water related diseases over the last 10 years are summarized below:&#13;

15.          The total resulting health costs attributable to the population served by the Baku water&#13;
supply system are presented in Table P. 1. The total health costs rise from an estimated US$ 3.7 million&#13;
in 1995 to US$ 3.4 million in 2000 and US$ 3.8 million in 2005 (note: the small fall between 1995 and&#13;
2000 is related to the assumption that a significant proportion of the refugees who are currently in the&#13;
Baku area will be able to return to their homelands). In terms of the Baku Water Supply Project, it has&#13;
been assumed that the following proportions of the total health costs will be savings attributable to the&#13;
proposed project: 1995 - 15%; 1996 - 20%; 1997 - 25%; 1998 - 30%; 1999 - 35%; and 2000 - 40%&#13;
(see: World Development Report: Investing in Health, World Bank, June 1993). The figures show the&#13;
health savings increasing steadily from US$ 600,000 in 1995 to US$ 1.4 million in 2000 and US$ 1.5&#13;
million in 2005.&#13;
16.          Incremental Savings in Annual Operating Costs - incremental savings will accrue&#13;
through: (a) a substantial reduction in electricity consumption resulting from improved system operation,&#13;
higher pumping efficiencies and lower non revenue water; and (b) reduced chemical requirements as a&#13;
result of the decline in non revenue water.&#13;
17.          Electricity - based on the Consultant's projections, it is expected that substantial electricity&#13;
savings will accrue from the reduction in water production resulting from the decline in non revenue&#13;
water which will enable the water company to reduce pumping from Kura 1, Kura 2 and Sangachel -&#13;
which currently account for more than 60% of Kommunpromvod's electricity consumption. The net&#13;
savings in electricity have an economic value of US$ 0.028 per kWh (see: Azerbaijan - Yenikend&#13;
Renewable Energy Project, Staff Appraisal Report, EBRD, October 1994). The resulting savings are&#13;
summarized below:&#13;

C. AVERAGE INCREMENTAL COST OF WATER (AIC)&#13;
20.          Introduction. The Average Incremental Cost (AIC) is the cost per m3 of water over the&#13;
expected economic life of the proposed works at a defined discount rate (which represents the opportunity&#13;
cost of investing the same capital resources in another project).&#13;
21.           All costs are presented in US$ at 1995 constant prices (i.e. excluding inflation). Economic&#13;
border prices are derived using the shadow price factors in Item 2.&#13;
Notes and Assumptions for the Calculations&#13;
22.           The AIC of additional water from the rehabilitation programme is computed by dividing&#13;
the Net Present Value (NPV) of the cost stream by the NPV of the incremental volume of water delivered&#13;
to the final consumer (i.e. water sold). The discount rate is the opportunity cost of capital, which is&#13;
estimated at 12%. Alternative rates of 10% and 14% have also been used for comparative purposes.&#13;
23.          The economic life of the proposed works is assumed to be 15 years after the completion&#13;
of construction and installation in 2000.&#13;
24.          The incremental water delivered to the consumer has been estimated for the "with" and&#13;
"without" project case on the same basis as specified in Items 4 and 5.&#13;
25.          Capital Costs, replacement capital costs and residual values - these are the same as in&#13;
Items 6, 7 and 8.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
26.          Incremental Annual Operations and Maintenance Costs - in view of the fact that the&#13;
proposed project is aimed at improving the efficiency of the existing water supply system and reducing&#13;
the high levels of non revenue water, then the applicable values must be examined in terms&#13;
of both the incremental savings and the incremental costs. These were evaluated in Items 9, 16, 17 and&#13;
18, and are summarized in both financial and economic costs as follows in US$ 000:&#13;

27.          Table P.3 presents the calculations of the AIC. The results indicate that at a discount rate&#13;
of 12%, the average incremental cost of water would be US$ 0.03 per m3 in financial prices and US$&#13;
0.02 per ml in economic prices.&#13;
D.    AFFORDABILITY CALCULATIONS&#13;
28.          A summary analysis for average-income and low-income households is presented in Table&#13;
P.4. The calculations are based on the following data and assumptions:&#13;
29.          Average household income - in mid-1994, average household income was US$ 44 per&#13;
month (source: Baku Social Assessment Survey, July 1994). Average incomes are projected to increase&#13;
as follows: 2.5 percent per year from 1995 to 1997 (which reflects the projected rate of inflation in US$&#13;
terms - see Annex 0, item 4); 5 percent per year from 1998 to 2000; and at 10 percent per year&#13;
thereafter (i.e. at 2.5 and 5 percentage points above the projected rate of inflation) reflecting a return to&#13;
sustained economic growth and a real improvement in living standards (see: Azerbaijan: From Crisis to&#13;
Sustained Growth, World Bank, September 1993).&#13;
30.          Low income household - income for the low income household is set at 45% of the&#13;
average, which corresponds to approximately US$ 20 per month. Low incomes are projected to increase&#13;
at the same rates as average household income (see item 29 above).&#13;
31.          Average family size for both average-income and low-income households is 4.5 persons&#13;
(source: Baku Social Assessment Survey, July 1994).&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
32.          Per capita water consumption:&#13;
(a)    Average income household: average domestic water consumption projected in Table 0.4&#13;
in Annex 0; and&#13;
(b)    Low income household: 100 litres per capita/day (equivalent to household with basic&#13;
plumbing facilities).&#13;
These values assume that future domestic water bills will use consumption figures are more realistic (i.e.&#13;
not 400 litres per capita/day as at present).&#13;
33.          Domestic water tariffs are assumed to increase as a proportion of the average tariff - from&#13;
20 percent in late-1994 to 50 percent from 1995 onwards. This assumption reflects the need to reduce&#13;
the level of cross-subsidization within the existing tariff structure.&#13;

            Azerbaijan - Greater Baku Water Supply
            Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objectives of the Greater
            Baku Water Supply Rehabilitation Project are to: 1) make
            emergency short term improvements in the water supply system
            to restore the water supply to Baku, in particular to the
            poorer elements of the population; 2) improve the water
            supply system as a whole; and 3) provide the basis for
            longer term planning and recovery. The project will comprise
            five major components: 1) water demand management to
            conserve water at the household level through a program of
            consumer awareness initiatives, through repairs to in-home
            plumbing, valves, taps and other fittings, and by
            rationalizing water use through meter installations and the
            implementation of a progressive water tariff; 2) operations
            and maintenance improvements to increase the amount of water
            available from the distribution system through a program of
            leak detection and repair, workshop and equipment
            acquisition, and at least a one year inventory of selected
            replacement valves and pipes; 3) supply improvements to
            improve the quantity and quality of water from the treatment
            works and enhancing the reliability of the distribution
            network ; 4) institutional capacity building to reorganize
            the water utility into a joint stock company; consolidating
            its offices; purchasing and installing new computers with
            new software; and developing training programs; and 5)
            preparation and implementation of a national policy
            framework for the water sector and preparing a regional
            master plan.
