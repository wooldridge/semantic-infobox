The Veil of Vouchers&#13;
Let's say state-owned enterprises are sold for   to accumulate or divest vouchers but would&#13;
vouchers only (that is, no cash is accepted) and   not alter the aggregate outstanding stock of cash&#13;
the auction involves multiple rounds of bidding,   or vouchers. Because bidders would find it&#13;
but final allocation and payment are made only   cheaper to tender vouchers at the auction, no&#13;
when there is no excess supply of or demand   cash would be tendered.&#13;
for any firm. (In the Czech privatization pro-&#13;
gram, most firms were sold in just two rounds   But some cash could be tendered if there were&#13;
of bidding.) Because vouchers have no use ex-   so few vouchers outstanding that they traded at&#13;
cept in buying these firms, the voucher price of   par in the secondary market. If only 80 million&#13;
each firm would be bid up or down until every   pengos in vouchers were distributed, for ex-&#13;
voucher distributed is tendered and every firm    ample, each voucher would tend to trade for&#13;

value and some for less, but the aggregate price   premium over face value. But because people&#13;
paid for all firms would have to equal the ag-   could pay cash for assets, no one would pay&#13;
gregate face value of vouchers. Thus, if only 50   more than a pengo for a voucher. So vouchers&#13;
million vouchers had been issued rather than   would never actually trade at a premium,4 and&#13;
200 million, all firms would still have sold,   all 80 million vouchers would be tendered at&#13;
though for an aggregate 50 million pengos in  the auction along with 20 million pengos in cash.&#13;
vouchers-a value unrelated to the assets' book&#13;
value of 150 million pengos.                 In this example, cash is tendered only because&#13;
the government had in effect put too low a ceil-&#13;
In addition, with 200 million vouchers issued,   ing on the cash price of vouchers. Accepting each&#13;
each with a face value of one pengo, the cash   voucher at face value-on par with cash-pre-&#13;
value in the secondary market for vouchers   vented the vouchers' real value (in terms of&#13;
need not equal 200 million pengos. Some   goods) from rising enough to clear the asset&#13;
voucher recipients would be uninterested in   market. (The cash price ceiling on vouchers is&#13;
buying firms and others would be interested   binding only if the aggregate nominal stock of&#13;

a voucher could be greater or less than a pengo   cash-which is unobservable before the auction.)&#13;

policymakers do not want to alter the amount&#13;
Cash and voucher auction                     of cash outstanding (and perhaps the price&#13;
level), it is better to issue "too many" vouchers.&#13;
If the government accepts any combination of   Harmlessly bidding up the voucher prices of&#13;
vouchers and cash as payment for assets, this  firms also allows the sale to fetch a "good" price,&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The author exposes some of the myths
            still surrounding the use of vouchers in mass privatization.
            He explains why using vouchers will not affect the price
            level in the economy-even though they carry a face value. He
            shows that vouchers allow assets to sell despite minimum
            acceptable bid prices because the secondary market discount
            of voucher prices acts as a safety valve. And he argues that
            vouchers do not create purchasing power or overcome capital
            shortages, as many claim. But why use them? He explains that
            vouchers help avoid rapid changes in the money supply that
            could have significant, real short-term effects. And they
            help create some harmless illusions-allowing reformers to
            avoid claims of selling assets too cheaply-and so safeguard
            the difficult transition to a market economy.
