                                   LUANDA DECLARATION&#13;
&#13;
Having met in Luanda, the Republic of Angola, at our 2015 Caucus, hosted and chaired by&#13;
Honorable Armando Manuel, Minister of Finance of the Republic of Angola and Chairman of&#13;
the African Caucus of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group&#13;
(WBG):&#13;
&#13;
           ï&#130;§   We, the African Governors of the IMF and the WBG discussed ways and means&#13;
               the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) can support our efforts to: (i) address the&#13;
               challenges of financing for sustainable development; (ii) combat tax evasion and&#13;
               eliminate illicit financial flows; (iii) invest in economic transformation and&#13;
               diversification; (iv) finance regional transformative infrastructure projects; and (v)&#13;
               enhance African voice and representation in the BWIs.&#13;
&#13;
IN THIS CONTEXT&#13;
&#13;
Mindful that the worldâ&#128;&#153;s increasingly volatile financial markets outlook means that finding the&#13;
resources to finance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be difficult, and conscious&#13;
that without the right financing and policies, we cannot achieve the set ambitions:&#13;
&#13;
           ï&#130;§   We submitted for support by the BWIs transformative solutions and actions - including&#13;
               strengthening public policies, harmonizing regulatory frameworks, developing&#13;
               public/private partnerships (PPPs), improving business climate, and restructuring&#13;
               sovereign debt - to unlock the potential of people and the private sector and incentivize&#13;
               changes in financing, consumption and production patterns in support of sustainable&#13;
               development.&#13;
&#13;
Acknowledging that illicit financial flows coupled with aggressive tax avoidance, repatriation of&#13;
profits and debt repayments are tragically depriving our countries of hundreds of billions of&#13;
dollars every year; and convinced that domestic resources that our countries can raise&#13;
themselves will be our largest single resource for funding our countriesâ&#128;&#153; development:&#13;
&#13;
           ï&#130;§   We proposed some focus areas where BWIs' assistance could help our countries to raise&#13;
               new development finance through domestic resource mobilization by increasing, inter&#13;
               alia, tax collection, private finance, international public finance; and, in particular,&#13;
               reducing illicit financial flows by 2030, with a view to eventually eliminate&#13;
               them, including through trade, monetary and financial systems, strengthened global&#13;
               economic governance, and improved international tax cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
Underscoring that natural resource wealth presents vast opportunities for development;&#13;
conscious that our countries that depend on it for export earnings and fiscal revenues face&#13;
peculiar challenges and remain highly vulnerable to various external shocks; and concerned that&#13;
more than two decades since the start of diversification programs, the lack of well-designed&#13;
diversification strategies and inadequate monitoring mechanisms have not helped facilitate&#13;
economic and export diversifications for Africaâ&#128;&#153;s transformation:&#13;
&amp;#12;           ï&#130;§   We suggested few actions that the BWIs could undertake in support of our countries to&#13;
               achieve economic and export diversification by spurring innovation and technologies in&#13;
               higher-value sectors - including agriculture, infrastructure, energy, manufacturing,&#13;
               services, data improvement, and capacity building - to unleash the spirit of&#13;
               entrepreneurship and drive Africaâ&#128;&#153;s transformation.&#13;
&#13;
Reaffirming that infrastructure development remains a key driver and a critical enabler for&#13;
sustainable growth in Africa; expressing concern on the inadequacy of current international&#13;
funding and delivery architecture in responding to Africa's infrastructure needs; noting that the&#13;
current favorable economic landscape in the continent provides us with a unique opportunity to&#13;
collectively address regional transformative infrastructure financing with a sense of urgency:&#13;
&#13;
           ï&#130;§   We proposed for Bank's support six regional transformative projects in energy and&#13;
               agriculture sectors; as well as a few innovative solutions to reduce Africa's growing&#13;
               infrastructure financing gap. We also called for BWIs' financial contributions into the&#13;
               African Development Bank's (AfDB) Africa50 initiative to unblock the challenges&#13;
               associated with infrastructure project preparation, bankability, and financial structuring&#13;
               as key prerequisites for attracting private capital investments.&#13;
&#13;
Reemphasizing the critical importance              and     urgency     of    increasing Africaâ&#128;&#153;s voice&#13;
and representation within the BWIs:&#13;
&#13;
           ï&#130;§   We reiterated our position that the size of the IMF Executive Board be aligned&#13;
               with the institutionâ&#128;&#153;s growing mandate and renewed our longstanding&#13;
               commitment to a third chair for Sub-Saharan Africa. We recalled the commitment&#13;
               of the Fund membership to complete the comprehensive review of the quota&#13;
               formula by January 2013, and our position for enhanced Africa's representation&#13;
               through quota shares that reflect our economic dynamism and underlying&#13;
               vulnerabilities. We agreed to maintain a concerted dialogue with the leadership at&#13;
               the IMF and the Bank to enhance the representation of African nationals and&#13;
               effectively promote their career development within the agreed institutional goals&#13;
               of diversity and mobility at all levels of staff.&#13;
FINALLY&#13;
&#13;
Cognizant that IDA is and should continue to be the most important source of funding in&#13;
achieving ambitious SDGs targets:&#13;
&#13;
           ï&#130;§   We renewed our support to the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s new financing initiatives to facilitate the&#13;
               transition from concessional to non-concessional funding, as well as the ongoing&#13;
               discussion of options to increase the resources available for development finance&#13;
               through IDA. We stand ready to be consulted on options that would be identified.&#13;
&#13;
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
We, African Governors, thank His Excellency President JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos, the&#13;
Government and the People of the Republic of Angola, for the hospitality and support they&#13;
accorded us throughout our stay in the country.&#13;
