I. COUNTRY AND ENERGY SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
1.1          Georgia has 5.4 million people in an area of 69,700 km2 bounded by Armenia,&#13;
Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey and the Black Sea. At independence in April 1991, Georgia was relatively&#13;
well-off with an educated labor force, a long tradition of entrepreneurship, and substantial natural&#13;
resources. Georgia's economy traditionally revolved around Black Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus&#13;
fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of manganese and copper; and a small industrial sector producing wine,&#13;
metals, machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The country also benefitted from transit fees, serving as an&#13;
important trade and transit corridor between Europe and Asia. Georgia's economy was highly integrated&#13;
within the former Soviet Union (FSU): total external trade - the average of imports and exports -&#13;
amounted to almost 43% of GDP in 1988-90, of which about 86% was with other FSU republics. The&#13;
country imported most of its energy fuels, including gas and petroleum products. Its only sizable domestic&#13;
energy sources are hydropower and woodfuel, providing about 16 percent each of its primary energy&#13;
needs.&#13;
1.2          The economic decline in Georgia has been dramatic, even in comparison with other FSU&#13;
countries. Since 1990, widespread conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia have magnified the economic&#13;
crisis resulting from the disintegration of the Soviet command economy in December 1991. The&#13;
cumulative decline in recorded output for the period 1990-1995 is estimated at more than 70%. Lax&#13;
fiscal and monetary policies led to large budget deficits and high inflation. Diminishing exports, due to&#13;
shrinking export markets and falling domestic output, and deteriorating terms of trade driven mainly by&#13;
the increasing costs of energy imports', quickly led to the accumulation of significant external debt and&#13;
payment arrears. Throughout 1993 and 1994, much of industry was functioning at only 20% of capacity;&#13;
heavy disruptions in agriculture took place; and tourism was shut down. The country was precariously&#13;
dependent on EU and US humanitarian grain shipments. Georgia is still suffering from an energy crisis,&#13;
as it is having problems paying for the necessary energy imports. Georgia is pinning its hopes for&#13;
recovery on reforming the economy along open market lines, reestablishing trade ties and on exploiting&#13;
its advantageous geographical position by developing international transport through the key Black Sea&#13;
ports of Poti and Batumi.&#13;
1.3          The severe economic decline has been caused largely by the break-up of economic ties&#13;
with other FSU republics and by ethnic and civil strife Georgia has suffered since independence. A&#13;
cease-fire went into effect in South Ossetia in 1992, and in Abkhazia in 1994, improving the political&#13;
situation. The government introduced a program to stabilize and reform the economy, including: stricter&#13;
monetary control; fiscal reforms with new tax measures and reduction of subsidies; strengthening the&#13;
financial sector; acceleration of privatization process; further liberalization of prices, foreign exchange&#13;
and trade regimes; and maintenance of a minimum social safety net. Implementation of the program has&#13;
been supported by the IMF and the World Bank. The IMF approved two purchases under the Systemic&#13;
Transformation Facility of US$40 million, in December 1994 and June 1995, and a Standby Arrangement&#13;
of US$104 million in June 1995. The World Bank (IDA) approved a Rehabilitation Credit of US$75&#13;
I     The price of oil and natural gas increased over 500% in dollar terms between 1991 and 1993.&#13;

million in March 1995, and a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) of US$60 million in April 1996.&#13;
Recent political events, including approval of a new Constitution, and the presidential and parliamentary&#13;
elections in November 1995, further stabilized the political situation and strengthened the economic&#13;
reforms. However, no long-term solution has yet been found for the status of Abkhazia and South&#13;
Ossetia.&#13;
B. Overview and Perspectives of the Energy Sector&#13;
1.4          Energy Demand. In the late&#13;
1980s,  the  primary  annual  energy          °°° Hr    0&#13;
consumption per capita exceeded 2.5 tons of  6000-1                          79000&#13;
oil equivalent, almost three times the average    0,.&#13;
of lower middle-income countries, indicating  000                            - 8000&#13;
a high energy intensity of the economy. The    D                               0_ ooo&#13;
steep downturn in the economy, combined                                       60.0&#13;
with severe energy supply shortages, resulted  0°                             600007&#13;
in  a  steady  decline  of gross  energy      000 -.                           000&#13;
consumption since 1990 (see Figure 1.1 and         I&#13;
Table 1.1). Given that economic output        000 H                           4000&#13;
declined faster than energy consumption, the    0               -   d          000&#13;
intensity in energy use actually increased.         990 99  99  99  994 99&#13;
Despite the energy supply constraints, little&#13;
evidence exists of attempts to improve energy                e g °   plo&#13;
efficiency or conserve energy.   To the                     DP&#13;
contrary, the shift in the structure of energy Fig. 1.1 GDP and Energy Consumption&#13;
consumption toward non-productive sectors&#13;
(households, budgetary organizations) - another indicator of inefficient allocation of available energy&#13;
resources (Table 1.1) - points to a worsening in energy intensity.&#13;
1.5          Primary Energy Resources. Georgia's main energy resource is hydropower. The&#13;
technical annual hydropower potential is estimated at about 88 TWh, of which only about 10% has been&#13;
developed. Coal reserves in the three mining regions (Tkvarcheli, Akhaltsikhe, Tkhibuli-Shaori) are&#13;
estimated at about 400 million tons. The coal industry, which used to produce 50% of primary energy&#13;
supply, has been constantly shrinking for the past 30 years, with only 4 mines in the Tkhibuli-Shaori&#13;
region currently operating. Estimates of proven oil reserves stand at 12 million tons. Oil production has&#13;
also declined significantly, from 3 million tons per year in the early 1980s to less than 70,000 tons in the&#13;
last few years, due to drying-up of the wells and increasingly difficult extraction conditions. Domestic&#13;
natural gas production is small, as well as the proven reserves (about 10 billion cubic meters). In&#13;
addition to hydro, renewable resources include wind, geothermal and solar energy.&#13;

Note: To convert a 1000 toe into natural units, the above numbers should be multiplied by the following factors: 4.0 for&#13;
hydropower and electricity imports and exports (in GWh); 1.74 for coal (in 1000 tons); 1.24 for natural gas (in million&#13;
cubic meters); 1.0 for crude oil (in 1000 tons); 0.92 for LPG (in 1000 tons); 1.0 for Kerosine (in 1000 tons); 1.04 for fuel&#13;
oil (in 1000 tons); 1.0 for other oil products (in tons); 5.37 for woodfuel (in 1000 cubic meters, solid).&#13;
1.6            Energy Supply. Georgia has been meeting a declining share of its primary energy needs&#13;
from domestic production, from close to 50% in the early 1980s to only 10-15%  in the pre-crisis years.&#13;
The decline was largely due to the rapid decrease in domestic oil production and substitution of domestic&#13;
coal and lignite with then-cheap gas from other republics. After the break-up of the FSU and the sharp&#13;
increase in prices of energy imports, Georgia quickly accumulated significant external debt and payment&#13;
arrears, and could not sustain the needed level of energy imports and supply. Domestic energy&#13;
production also declined, although its share in total primary energy supply increased by 1994 to 34%,&#13;
but at the expense of major energy shortages.  There was a consequently large increase in the&#13;
uncontrolled use of woodfuel, damaging the environment, especially the forests. Inadequate energy&#13;
supply has become a major impediment to economic recovery.&#13;

4                                                          Country and Energy Sector Background&#13;
1.7           Energy Prices. With the exception of prices for oil products imported by private traders&#13;
which are liberalized, energy prices are regulated by the Ministry of Economy. The prices have been&#13;
historically kept much below the economic supply costs and energy consumption was heavily subsidized.&#13;
The problem has been exacerbated by the extremely low collection of payments for gas and electricity&#13;
(see Chapter IlI. B). Only in 1994 did the Government eliminate subsidies and start closing the gap&#13;
between prices and costs, but significant problems, particularly with electricity prices and collection rates,&#13;
still persist.&#13;
1.8           Macroeconomnic and Energy Demand Prospects.  The prudent economic policies and&#13;
implementation of the stabilization program over the last two and a half years have resulted in&#13;
stabilization of macroeconomic conditions. The overall budget deficit (on accrual basis and including&#13;
grants) was reduced from 16.5%  of GDP in 1994 to 5.3%  in 1995 and 3.9%  in 1996. The average&#13;
monthly inflation rate fell from 64 % in 1994 to about 4 % in 1995 and 1.1 % in 1996. The exchange rate&#13;
has remained stable since the end of 1994. Economic growth resumed in 1995 (2.4%), and further&#13;
increased in 1996 (10.5%), building on the recovery of agriculture and the service sectors observed in&#13;
1995. The progress was supported by improved institutional and political conditions, and the continuous&#13;
progress in privatization, restructuring of the infrastructure sectors and by the steady increasing trade with&#13;
neighboring countries. GDP is expected to grow at about 10 percent during the next several years&#13;
followed by a gradual return to more modest growth of about 5 to 6 percent. Improvements in living&#13;
standards will also be gradual, and only by the turn of the century will private consumption levels recover&#13;
to the pre-1993 levels. Energy demand is expected to follow the general pattern of economic output.&#13;
Improvements in energy efficiency, particularly in the medium-to-long term, should keep, rates of&#13;
increasing energy consumption below the economic output rates.&#13;
1.9           Sector Organization and Institutions.  Georgia's energy sector organizational and&#13;
institutional infrastructure is still dominated by Soviet-era establishments --large monopolistic government-&#13;
owned enterprises/departments2 which, in addition to exercising business and ownership functions, have&#13;
major roles in policy making and regulation. Between 1993 -- when the Ministry of Energy was&#13;
abolished -- and 1996 -- when it was re-established -- there was no clear institutional responsibility for&#13;
energy policy. As result, day-to-day crisis management and reactive measures, rather than active&#13;
management of energy issues, have characterized the recent period. The weakness of the administrative&#13;
structure has contributed significantly to the slow pace of reforms in the energy sector concerning sector&#13;
restructuring, commercialization and privatization.&#13;
1.10          In spite of this, the economic and political changes did start to make some inroads into&#13;
the energy sector. Oil product marketing has been liberalized and open to the private sector, although&#13;
more needs to be done to make the market more competitive and transparent. There are a number of&#13;
joint ventures with foreign private companies in oil exploration and production. Gas transmission is&#13;
moving toward an open-access regime. The power sector is making an earnest attempt to reform, as&#13;
described in more detail in Section D.&#13;
2     The following are main government enterprisesldepartments in the energy sector: Sakgaze (gas transmission and&#13;
distribution), Saknaftobi (oil production and refining), Saknaftoproducti (oil product distribution), and Saknahchiri (coal&#13;
production). Sakenergo - former department of electric power -- is being restructured.&#13;
&#13;

Country and Energy Sector Background                                                                       5&#13;
1.11            Energy Sector Financial and Operational Issues. Failure to adjust domestic energy&#13;
prices to increasing supply costs, coupled with extremely low collection of payments for gas and&#13;
electricity over a prolonged period3, made the energy enterprises insolvent and significantly contributed&#13;
toward accumulation of large external and internal debts and payment arrears. Debt for energy imports&#13;
increased significantly: total government debt to Turkmenistan for natural gas imports grew from zero&#13;
in 1991 to US$440 million in 19944. In the context of high inflation eroding domestic debt this&#13;
amounted to a significant subsidization of consumers at the expense of energy enterprises, creating major&#13;
distortions in the economy and accumulation of external debt. The financial problems led to maintenance&#13;
backlogs, disrepair, accelerated dilapidation of physical assets, and substandard operation of energy&#13;
facilities. Both technical and commercial energy losses increased as well.&#13;
1.12            Investment Priorities in the Energy Sector.  While in the FSU, Georgia developed&#13;
significant, although suboptimal, energy infrastructure. Part of it is run down and may be beyond repair,&#13;
but still a significant part is operational or can be rehabilitated. Rehabilitation of the existing facilities,&#13;
particularly in the electricity and gas sectors, should be generally more cost-effective than investment in&#13;
new ones. Investment objectives, in the short-to-medium term, should focus on alleviation of energy&#13;
shortages through rehabilitation and repairs, and on strengthening commercial functions, through reducing&#13;
commercial losses and supporting financial recovery through improved metering, pricing, billing and&#13;
collections.&#13;
1.13            Other Energy Sector Issues. The internal and regional political problems have created&#13;
major difficulties in energy supply as well. The civil upheavals in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well&#13;
as elsewhere in the region (Chechnya) - the areas through which major transport and energy network&#13;
routes are passing - made energy imports impossible or extremely difficult and expensive. Access to&#13;
the largest hydropower plant in Georgia, the Inguri plant with 1300 MW nominal capacity, located in&#13;
Abkhazia and in need of urgent repair, is limited, which makes it difficult to operate and maintain and&#13;
raises the issue of the safety of the plant and dam5. Imports of electricity to Abkhazia and South Ossetia&#13;
3       Until September 1994, domestic tariffs for gas and electricity were several times lower than the supply costs. Since&#13;
then, the tariffs have increased, but are still below the cost recovery level (see Section III.B).&#13;
4       Gas imports in 1995 were sharply reduced, and handled by commercial enterprises rather than through the&#13;
intergovernmental agreements. As a result, the Government debt for gas imports should not have increased significantly,&#13;
although the figures are not yet available. Negotiations with Turkmenistan on rescheduling the existing debt are still going on&#13;
although haltingly.&#13;
5       The Inguri plant generated between 2.3 and 4.3 TWh electricity annually, or almost 50% of domestic hydropower.&#13;
Although the plant is in Abkhazia, its dam and water reservoir are outside the Abkhazia region. The reservoir, with a volume&#13;
of 1110 million m3, has a dual curvature arch dam, 272 meters high (the world highest) and 728 meters long at its crest. In&#13;
an accident in November 1994, while trying to raise a 200-ton slide gate which isolates each of the seven low-level outlets (180&#13;
m below the dam crest), a gantry crane rail ruptured, rendering the crane unusable. Five workers lost their lives. The gate&#13;
seals are in poor condition but cannot be repaired until the slide gate is restored. Water leaks through the gates at a rate of about&#13;
25 cubic meters per second, equivalent to about 1.8 GWh of electricity per day (657 GWh annually, worth about US$20 million&#13;
if valued at US c3/kWh). A large portion of equipment and instrumentation at the dam was destroyed or stolen during the civil&#13;
strife in the area. Given the size of the reservoir and the dam, measures to repair the damage and install additional equipment&#13;
for safety monitoring are of highest priority.&#13;

from Russia are not controlled by Sakenergo - Georgia's power utility company - but Georgia accepts&#13;
financial obligations for these imports, although Sakenergo cannot collect payments6 (see para. 3.17).&#13;
C. Power Sector Conditions and Priority Needs&#13;
1.14         Electricity Demand. The share of electricity in final consumption was about 36-38%&#13;
in the late 1980s-early 1990s, falling to less than 25% by 1995. This decline is largely explained by the&#13;
sharp drop in outputs and incomes in the economy, and partly by the severe electricity shortages that have&#13;
beset the electricity supply industry due to the dependance of generation on imported gas and the unabated&#13;
deterioration of the industry's assets. Total gross consumption of electricity fell from 17.4 TWh in 1989&#13;
to 7.6 TWh in 1995 (Table 1.2). End-user demand fell even more because of increased losses. Sectoral&#13;
shifts in electricity consumption reveal increased share of household consumption - from about 16% in&#13;
1988 to more than 40% in 1994 - in spite of the fact that households kept paying less than 10% of what&#13;
they owed. Electricity, in the absence of gas and district heating, was the only available energy (even&#13;
if intermittently) to many households in larger cities, which used it for space and water heating, often&#13;
with makeshift appliances. Lack of any serious enforcement of payments through cut-offs (or otherwise)&#13;
kept electricity demand relatively high and above available supply. This, in turn, led to rationing of&#13;
electricity by the government according to political priorities rather than its allocation by commercial and&#13;
economic principles. Government's priorities have favored households at the expense of productive uses,&#13;
worsening the already precarious financial position of the power sector, further eroding the power&#13;
industry's ability to maintain its assets and supply electricity on an economic and reliable basis. This&#13;
destabilizing downward spiral has not yet been stopped.&#13;
1.15          Electricity demand in 1997 is assumed to be supply-constrained, because of both the&#13;
limited domestic electricity production capabilities and limited capability to pay for imports of fuel and&#13;
electricity. On the basis of expected available supply, demand in 1997 was set at 6.9 TWh. Demand&#13;
for the period after 1997 was forecast7 on the basis of expected economic growth. To account also for&#13;
the expected real increases in effective tariffs, a dynamic model was developed. From 1998 to 2000&#13;
demand is expected to grow at close to 10 percent per annum, and at 5.2 percent afterwards (Annex 3).&#13;
1.16         Electricity Supply. Georgia's domestic power generation -- i.e., generation based on&#13;
domestic primary energy resources -- has been based since the early 1980s entirely on hydropower, and&#13;
amounted to about 50% of total domestic consumption. The rest was generated using imported natural&#13;
gas and oil (about 30 %), and directly imported (about 20 %). Total annual hydro generation in the period&#13;
1989-1995 declined from about 8100 GWh in 1989 to 4600 GWh in 1994 and 5600 GWh in 1995;&#13;
thermal generation decreased continuously from about 6400 in 1989-90 to 703 GWh in 1995; and imports&#13;
also continuously declined from 4000-4300 GWh in 1989-90 to 754 GWh in 1995. Some electricity was&#13;
exported (1700 GWh in 1989), but these exports were seasonal, in periods of high water inflows and full&#13;
reservoirs (late spring-early summer); in the past few years even such exports disappeared. Dependence&#13;
on  electricity  imports  and  domestic  generation  based  on  imported  fuel  increased&#13;
6      In 1995, Abkhazia consumed 707 GWh and South Ossetia 118 GWh, which amounts to about 13 % of total consumption&#13;
at the distribution level.&#13;
7      The forecast was made for the total domestic demand, without self-consumption of power plants.&#13;

8                                                             Country and Energy Sector Background&#13;
with the late 1970s-early 1980s conversion of power plants from using domestic coal to firing imported&#13;
gas and oil. The increasing difficulties in financing imports of gas, oil and electricity in the aftermath&#13;
of the FSU break-up and the disrepair of the Gardabani plant, caused a sharp decline in the import-related&#13;
electricity supply. In 1989, direct electricity imports and domestic generation based on imported fuel&#13;
amounted to about 10.3 TWh; the same figure in 1995 stood at about 1.5 TWh. Internal civil conflicts,&#13;
particularly in Abkhazia (where the Inguri hydro plant is located), and deterioration of hydro plants and&#13;
power system facilities in general due to lack of maintenance and sub-standard operation, led to a&#13;
decrease in domestic generation and increased losses, further reducing the amount of electricity available&#13;
to end-users. During the last several years electricity was strictly rationed. Supply in the winter was&#13;
available even in Tbilisi for a few hours only, and some regions have been continuously disconnected.&#13;
1.17           Electric Power Infrastructure. Georgia has an extensive electric network coverage -&#13;
practically all households are connected to the network. Its generation and transmission capacities were&#13;
developed in the context of the FSU economic and power system planning, and operated as a part of the&#13;
integrated power system of the FSU.8 Both the fuel mix (share of hydropower, coal, oil, gas etc. in&#13;
electricity generation) and the capacity mix (size and type of generating units - base, intermediate,&#13;
peaking) were optimized relative to the Transcaucasus Integrated Power System (IPS) and the FSU&#13;
system, and are sub-optimal for Georgia's power system taken alone.&#13;
1.18           Total installed nameplate capacity of power plants in Georgia is about 5,090 MW, of&#13;
which 2,088 MW belongs to three thermal plants with 15 units (Gardabani - 1,850 MW, 10 units;&#13;
Tkvarcheli - 220 MW, 2 units; Tbilisi CHP - 18 MW, 3 units); 2,843.5 MW is in 103 hydro plants with&#13;
182 units (of which 6 are large storage plants and 17 are larger run-of-river (RoR) plants; others are&#13;
small RoR plants), 5.4 MW are diesel units, and about 153 MW industrial plants ("block stations"). The&#13;
available capacity, however, is much lower, because of disrepair and damage caused by the civil wars&#13;
and improper operation. The currently available thermal capacity is only about 400 MW, while the&#13;
available capacity at hydro plants ranges between 400 MW and 1,000 MW, depending on water&#13;
availability and maintenance status. Average production of all hydro plants would theoretically be about&#13;
10,000 GWh per year, assuming all were operational and in good condition; maximum production,&#13;
however, was 8,777 GWh in 1988, and average production between 1985 and 1993 was 7,480 GWh;&#13;
in 1994 it reached only 4,500 GWh.&#13;
1.19           The power transmission network consists of 500-kV, 330-kV, and 220-kV lines. The&#13;
500-kV line is the transmission backbone, connecting the western part of the country, where most of&#13;
hydro generation is concentrated including Inguri, with the Gardabani plant in the eastern part. It was&#13;
also meant to be the main regional transmission link, connecting Georgia, Russia and Azerbaijan.&#13;
Georgia has another 220-kV link with Russia, a 220-kV link with Armenia, a 1 10-kV with Turkey, and&#13;
220-kV and 330-kV connections with Azerbaijan. The network of 220 kV and higher voltage has 18&#13;
substations; including the 1 10-kV network (part of which has a transmission role as well), the number&#13;
of substations rises to 260. The transmission network suffers from the lack of regular maintenance and&#13;
S      Together with the power systems of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Georgian system constituted the Transcaucasian&#13;
Interconnected Power System (IPS) - one of the 11 IPSs in the FSU - controlled and dispatched from the Transcaucasian&#13;
regional dispatch center in Tbilisi (subordinated to the main system dispatch center in Moscow), to which the Georgian national&#13;
dispatch center (also in Tbilisi) was subordinated. In the regional context, Georgia had been developing hydro plants, Azerbaijan&#13;
oil-based plants, and Armenia built a nuclear plant (in addition to a mixture of gas-fired and hydropower plants). In all three&#13;
countries, as in the FSU in general, investment policies in the last 15-20 years favored use of natural gas in electricity&#13;
generation. The Transcaucasus region, as a whole, was an energy and electricity importer in the FSU, although net direct&#13;
electricity imports, unlike fuel imports, were not significant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Country and Energy Sector Background                                                                    9&#13;
theft of the material, and has very poor reliability9. In addition to the problems characterizing the&#13;
transmission network (lack of maintenance, pilferage), the distribution network has been subject to more&#13;
difficult operating regimes during the hours when electricity was available as the only energy to&#13;
households and, therefore experiencing surges in demand frequently above the design capacity, which has&#13;
led to damage of the equipment.&#13;
1.20            The main national dispatch center (NDC) is located in Tbilisi, with a regional dispatch&#13;
center in Kutaisi serving as its backup. The real-time data acquisition system -- rudimentary by design&#13;
with no remote control capabilities -- is practically inoperable. Dispatchers at NDC have to rely on&#13;
verbal phone conversations with the field operators to monitor and control the system. However, this&#13;
mode of communication is also unreliable because of the poor telephone system, and dispatchers&#13;
sometimes do not have even a phone connection with some hydro plants for days.&#13;
1.21            The power system in Georgia operates in permanent semi-emergency mode. Not only&#13;
is it cut off from the neighboring systems'", but it often operates several electrically independent&#13;
subsystems, with certain power plants supplying certain limited geographical areas. With demand&#13;
exceeding the available supply, dispatchers are continuously struggling to maintain the electric balance&#13;
by switching-off consumers and rationing electricity. The generation/consumption balance is usually&#13;
maintained at a system frequency of less than the optimal 50 Hz, which enables supply to be provided&#13;
to a somewhat larger number of customers, although with poorer quality and at the cost of accelerated&#13;
deterioration of power system's and users' equipment. With such poor control and commnunications,&#13;
system frequency is also very unstable, which has additional negative effects on the equipmentu.&#13;
Technical and commercial losses in the transmission and distribution network are high -- about 25 % for&#13;
the first ten months in 1996, without supplies to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and 34 % if supplies to these&#13;
regions are accounted for as commercial losses. Other problems include low availability, reliability and&#13;
efficiency of the Gardabani thermal power plant, high water losses at hydro plants and their low&#13;
efficiency, and lack of spare parts and qualified maintenance personnel. Poor communications facilities&#13;
are preventing full dispatch control of the system.&#13;
1.22            Investment priorities.  In the short-to-medium  term general investment priorities are&#13;
to restore the system capacity through enhanced maintenance, repair and rehabilitation. This would&#13;
alleviate the electricity shortages and create conditions to connect the system with neighboring electricity&#13;
networks, enabling better electricity trade and parallel operation, and improving the quality and reliability&#13;
of service. Analysis of system generation capacity and demand forecast (Annex 3) leads to the conclusion&#13;
that, most likely, no new generation capacity is needed before the year 2002. Based on Sakenergo's&#13;
9       The transmission system experienced 114 incidents of line outages on 500-, 330- and 220-kV lines in the first 8 months&#13;
of 1995. It was reported that the line faults were a major cause of these outages, which often led to regional or country-wide&#13;
blackouts (27 country-wide blackouts were reported in the same period).&#13;
10     Imports are effected in so-called "radial" regime where consumers, fed through an import line, are cut-off electrically&#13;
from the rest of the Georgian power system which, consequently, continues to operate in the "island" mode.&#13;
11      During the last two winters frequency was kept mostly at about 45 Hz, occasionally decreasing as low as 42 Hz.&#13;
After the rehabilitation of unit 9 at Gardabani, the frequency is not allowed to go below 48.5 Hz (otherwise the unit would trip).&#13;
Because of unstable frequency, however, which continuously changes by several tenths of a Herz within several minutes - an&#13;
extremely undesirable and unstable regime - the newly rehabilitated 300-MW unit 9 at the Gardabani plant cannot exceed&#13;
generation of 180 MW.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                            Country and Energy Sector Background&#13;
assessment and some preliminary system studies"2, rehabilitation of 300-MW units (no. 9 and 10) at the&#13;
Gardabani thermal power station, and rehabilitation of larger hydro plants Inguri, Ladjanuri, Khrami-II,&#13;
Tkhibuli, Vartsikhe, Rioni, Gumatai and Jinvali -- should be given highest priority'3. Several options are&#13;
available for system expansion in the medium-to-long term (after year 2001), with large hydro potential&#13;
of the country playing the most important role.&#13;
1.23           Similarly, operation of transmission and distribution networks could be significantly&#13;
improved through a number of low-cost measures, such as replacement of circuit-breakers, air&#13;
compressors, accumulator batteries, etc. Priorities should be given to the substations connecting the&#13;
network to major power plants and load centers, and interconnecting system to the neighboring countries.&#13;
The replacement of windings, cores and oil for transformers, and other items, based on an in-depth&#13;
inventory of problems in distribution, could be of great benefit in enhancing reliability and quality of&#13;
service. The improvements will have to be implemented over time and selectively, with first priority&#13;
given to major load centers and improvements in metering and load management capabilities.&#13;
1.24           Urgent measures are needed to restore at least basic communications with power plants&#13;
and major substations to ensure a minimal level of system integrity and reliability. In the medium-to-long&#13;
term it would be necessary to install modern communications, data acquisition and monitoring systems,&#13;
and to upgrade control and dispatch to a technical standard common in today's power systems.&#13;
1.25           The total investment needs for the generation system until the year 2005 have been&#13;
estimated at about US$800 million of which about US$300 million would be used for rehabilitation of&#13;
the existing plants (mainly until the year 2002) to recover about 1500 MW, and the rest for the&#13;
construction or completion of new plants (after the year 2000). Under the assumed demand projection&#13;
scenario (Annex 3), new capacity will not be needed before the year 2002. The needed rehabilitation&#13;
works could be financed initially, in large part, through borrowing from international financing&#13;
institutions. International financing institutions have committed or are considering allocation of about&#13;
US$180 million for investment in the power sector in the 1995-1998 period (Annex 5). As the system&#13;
restores its capacity and financial health, and with general economic recovery, investments would be&#13;
increasingly financed through privatization, internal resources and commercial borrowing. Since the&#13;
financing needs will increase as new projects come on stream, it will be necessary to attract more capital&#13;
from the private sector, both domestic and foreign. The commercialization, corporatization, and&#13;
restructuring of the power industry, establishment of a modern legal and regulatory framework, and&#13;
privatization of sector enterprises which have already been initiated, should encourage private sector&#13;
investment, either directly through various independent power producer schemes, or through lending.&#13;
1.26           Sector Financial Crisis. The entire electric power sector is in a deep financial crisis.&#13;
Due to low tariffs and, particularly, low collection of payments (only about 20% in 1995, and about 50%&#13;
in 1996), the power industry has incurred heavy financial and asset losses, accumulated large debts and&#13;
payment arrears, and suffered persistent shortage of working capital. The low collections were due to&#13;
several factors: (i) inadequate social safety net in the context of the sharp economic contraction and&#13;
12     "Development of an Energy Policy in Georgia - Rehabilitation and Extension of the Hydroelectric System",&#13;
Kantor/Seed Consortium, 1994;&#13;
13     Rehabilitation of the Inguri plant should probably be first priority on technical grounds (see footnote 5). Because of&#13;
the political problems in the region, however, the risk associated with launching a major rehabilitation project at this time would&#13;
be very high. Once the political situation in Abkhazia is stabilized, both the Inguri and hydro plants which are downstream of&#13;
the Inguri, should be rehabilitated&#13;
&#13;

income decline, and tolerance of non-payment from all consumers, particularly residential; (ii) inefficient&#13;
sector organization and management, (iii) political interference with its operation, resulting in failure of&#13;
electricity enterprises to fully enforce payments through disconnection of non-payers or other legal means;&#13;
(iv) inadequate or delayed budgetary transfers to organizations that are financed fully or partially by&#13;
central or local government budgets (schools, hospitals, water and sewerage companies, etc.); and (v)&#13;
political problems, particularly those related to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The ability of domestic&#13;
banks to provide credit for working capital was, and still is, very limited. Shortage of working capital&#13;
becomes particularly critical during winter periods, when fuel requirements of the Gardabani thermal&#13;
plant -- providing 40-50% of electricity supply to the country in the winter -- are highest. This creates&#13;
severe shortages of electricity during the critical winter seasons and results in serious political problems&#13;
for the Governmnent, making it difficult to implement the reform program  calling for significant&#13;
improvements in collections and increase in tariffs.&#13;
D. Goverrnent Policy and Strategy in the Power Sector&#13;
1.27          Stemming the energy crisis and improving the energy supply is one of the highest&#13;
priorities for the Government of Georgia, as it would remove a major constraint on economic recovery&#13;
and cause of hardship to the population. The main objectives of the Government policy in the power&#13;
sector in the short-term are to increase power supply and improve collection of payments -- the two major&#13;
premises for resolving the current energy crisis. The first objective is to be achieved mainly through&#13;
rehabilitation projects, which would recover the production capacity -- lost by lack of maintenance and&#13;
improper operation of the existing facilities -- and improve supply efficiency. Several rehabilitation&#13;
projects have already been initiated or are under preparation -- all financed by the international&#13;
multilateral and bilateral agencies. Improved collections would also lead to immediate improvement in&#13;
power supply by enabling more financing of fuel and electricity imports. Furthermore, improved&#13;
collections are the necessary element to any sustainable strategy to arrest the energy crisis and recover&#13;
the sector.&#13;
1.28          The Government is aware that more than physical rehabilitation needs to be done in order&#13;
to improve operation of the power sector on a sustainable basis. With assistance from the World Bank,&#13;
USAID, Government of Germany (via KfW), EBRD, EU, and other international agencies, the&#13;
Goverment has been developing a reform strategy for the sector, which addresses its institutional,&#13;
financial, and structural problems. The main objectives, principles and policies of this strategy are&#13;
outlined in the Government's Letter of Sector Development Policy (LSDP). The LSDP (Annex 1) states&#13;
that Goverment's strategy to achieve sustainable efficiency in the power sector will be based on: (i)&#13;
corporatization, commercialization and decentralization (unbundling) of the power industry; (ii)&#13;
implementation of commercial practices and enforcement of payments; (iii) economic pricing of electricity&#13;
with due regard to poor residential users; (iv) establishment of a legal and regulatory framework to&#13;
promote competition and private sector participation, including instituting an independent regulatory&#13;
agency; (v) optimization of the use of resources by fostering least cost development plans; (vi) focusing&#13;
investments in the short and medium term on the economic rehabilitation of existing facilities and&#13;
completion of economically viable but partially completed projects; (vii) promotion of efficient use and&#13;
conservation of electricity; and (viii) protection of the environment in electricity production and use.&#13;
1.29          The Govermment started to implement some measures related to its new policy. In June&#13;
1996, Parliament established a Ministry of Energy (which had been abolished in 1993) -- as the main&#13;
agency for implementing and coordinating Government policies in the sector. In July 1996 the President&#13;
issued a Decree on Power Sector Reforms (Annex 2). The Decree stipulates:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                         Country and Energy Sector Background&#13;
(i)    preparation of an electricity law;&#13;
(ii)    establishment of an Electricity Regulatory  Commission  and development of a&#13;
methodology for setting electricity tariffs;&#13;
(iii)   restructuring of the power industry through separation of generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution activities;&#13;
(iv)    commercialization of sector enterprises;&#13;
(v)    development of privatization strategies for generation and distribution companies.&#13;
1.30          Implementation of the Decree is in progress.  The Electricity law, satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
was presented to the Parliament on May 6, 1997. The electricity regulatory agency -- now attached to&#13;
the Ministry of Economy -- should become independent after adoption of electricity law by the&#13;
Parliament. Sakenergo -- formerly vertically integrated state power utility company -- has been separated&#13;
into distribution, transmission-and-dispatch, and generation companies. A number of municipally-based&#13;
distribution companies have been established.  Sakenergo has become a transmission-and-dispatch&#13;
company, a state enterprise which operates the transmission network and controls dispatch, and acts as&#13;
a wholesale supplier. There are two newly created generation companies: (i) Tbilsresi, a joint-stock&#13;
company which operates the Gardabani thermal power plant, and (ii) Sakenergogeneration, a state&#13;
enterprise which operates all other generation capacities which belonged to Sakenergo before&#13;
restructuring. A number of independent power suppliers -- a few small privatized hydro plants and&#13;
several industrial cogeneration plants -- continue selling their electricity to Sakenergo.&#13;
1.31          The electricity market in Georgia is also in transition. At the wholesale level it currently&#13;
operates predominantly in the central-purchasing-agency mode, with Sakenergo -- the power purchasing&#13;
agency for domestic generation and imports and the wholesale supplier to distribution companies and&#13;
direct consumers -- acting as a central purchasing agency. However, some generators (some hydro plants&#13;
within Sakenergogeneration and some private plants) sell their electricity directly to industrial consumers.&#13;
At the retail-sale level, residential, commercial and most industrial customers buy electricity from the&#13;
local distribution companies; some industrial consumers, however, buy electricity from Sakenergo or&#13;
from power plants directly. The market structure is expected to evolve further toward increased&#13;
competition in the generation sector, as well as in the end-user supply market.&#13;
1.32          The Government and the sector enterprises have taken steps to resolve the problem of&#13;
payment arrears, low collections and low tariffs.  During the period September-December 1996,&#13;
Sakenergo, Sakenergogeneration and Tbilsresi, together with the Government, prepared a Financial&#13;
Rehabilitation Plan for the power industry, restructured payment arrears and strengthened contractual&#13;
relationships. Collections, although still low, have steadily improved during 1996, reaching the average&#13;
level of about 56%, compared with less than 20% in 1995. A further major improvement in collection&#13;
rates is needed, particularly in the residential sector, but the trend is very encouraging. The Government&#13;
has also increased residential tariffs in December 1996 to 3.5 tetri/kWh, bringing them closer to the level&#13;
of 4.5 tetri/kWh charged to other users. The Government intends to increase residential tariffs after the&#13;
1996/97 winter to 4.5 tetri/kWh, bringing the average end-user tariffs close to the full cost-recovery&#13;
level.&#13;

1.33          The Government is developing a privatization strategy for the power sector.  A&#13;
privatization decree, setting some general principles for privatization of generation and distribution&#13;
companies, was issued by the Government in December 1996.&#13;
E. World Bank Strategy and Experience&#13;
1.34          The World Bank's lending experience in Georgia dates from FY95, but already nine&#13;
projects have been approved. Five projects are under implementation, two have closed, and two recently&#13;
approved are not yet effective. Three operations were approved in FY95: an Institution Building Credit&#13;
of US$10.1 million equivalent (July 5, 1994), a Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation Credit of US$18&#13;
million equivalent (November 8, 1994), and a Rehabilitation Credit of US$75 million equivalent (March&#13;
30, 1995; closed). Following strong implementation of the Government's 1995 economic reform program&#13;
supported by the Rehabilitation Credit, a Structural Adjustment Credit of US$60 million equivalent (April&#13;
18, 1996; closed), aimed at deepening structural reforms, was approved, along with a Structural&#13;
Adjustment Technical Assistance Credit of US$4.8 million equivalent (April 18, 1996) to facilitate&#13;
implementation of these reforms through provision of technical assistance. Two investment projects were&#13;
approved in FY96, one in the transport sector in the amount of US$12 million equivalent (January 18,&#13;
1996) to cover urgent rehabilitation needs, and the other in the health sector in the amount of US$14&#13;
million (April 25, 1996) to assist in the implementation of the Government's ambitious health sector&#13;
reform program. Two operations were approved in FY97: an Agriculture Development Project of US$15&#13;
million equivalent (March 25, 1997) and an Oil Institution Building Technical Assistance Project of&#13;
US$1.4 million equivalent (April 8, 1997). Georgia is also benefitting from the GEF-funded Black Sea&#13;
Environmental Program.&#13;
1.35          Overall portfolio performance is good despite the relative lack of experience in&#13;
implementing World Bank projects.  The three most important contributing factors to this good&#13;
performance have been strong ownership of the program by the Government, extensive efforts aimed at&#13;
strengthening project implementation capacities through training of local staff and provision of consulting&#13;
services, and strong structural reforms performance enabling the development of sound investment&#13;
programs.&#13;
1.36          The proposed Power Rehabilitation Project would be the second IDA credit to the Georgia&#13;
energy sector"4. A limited Country Assistance Strategy, whose objectives are to help reverse economic&#13;
decline, assist in the transition to a market economy, and to alleviate the poverty which has emerged in&#13;
Georgia in recent years, was discussed by the Board on March 30, 1995 as part of the President's Report&#13;
for the Rehabilitation Credit (Report No. P-6797-GE). The proposed project is consistent with that&#13;
strategy, which identified the energy sector as one of the key constraints to economic development. The&#13;
strategy recognized the needs for rehabilitation of the existing electricity infrastructure and for policy and&#13;
institutional strengthening of the power sector. The preparation of the project took into account the&#13;
lessons learned from past operations. Government support of the energy sector reform program and of&#13;
the identified investment needs to be financed under the proposed project has been very strong. The&#13;
proposed project results from a closely coordinated effort among all involved partners, both within&#13;
Georgia and among financial institutions and bilateral donors. Some most important elements of energy&#13;
policy and institutional reforms, including elimination of direct and indirect subsidies (in the form of&#13;
tolerating non-payments, maintaining low tariffs and their inappropriate structure, and tolerating soft&#13;
14     The other project in the energy sector is the Oil Institution Building Project (US$1.4 million equivalent), whose objectives are to&#13;
enhance the local capacity to undertake intemational negotiations in respect to oil pipeline transit; this project is at the negotiation stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                       Country and Energy Sector Background&#13;
budget constraints), demonopolization and privatization of energy enterprises, and legal and regulatory&#13;
reform were supported under the Structural Adjustment Credit. The reforms in the power sector&#13;
progressed rapidly throughout 1996.&#13;
1.37          IDA's objectives in the power sector are to support Georgia's effort to arrest the energy&#13;
crisis and reverse deterioration of physical assets, improve cost recovery in electricity supply, increase&#13;
supply to productive sectors through economic allocation of electricity (i.e., through adopting cost-&#13;
reflective tariffs and enforcing payments), and accelerate institutional and structural reforms to promote&#13;
and sustain efficient allocation of investments and efficient use of energy. These objectives would&#13;
facilitate economic growth and promote the transition of the country to a market economy, supporting&#13;
wider objectives of IDA's involvement in Georgia. Achieving the objectives will require opening of the&#13;
policy environment, commercialization and demonopolization of electricity supply and use, diversification&#13;
of ownership and accelerated privatization, rehabilitation of physical infrastructure, and extension of the&#13;
social safety net to cover minimum energy consumption of needy families.&#13;
1.38          IDA's on-going dialogue with the Government concerning financial and institutional&#13;
problems in the power sector focuses on:&#13;
a.     financial rehabilitation of the sector through improved collection, enforcement of payment&#13;
discipline, establishing cost-recovery tariffs, and debt restructuring; and&#13;
b.     support to the sector reforms, designed to unbundle, demonopolize and commercialize&#13;
the power industry, diversify ownership and attract private capital, and create a suitable&#13;
regulatory and legal framework.&#13;
IDA is providing technical assistance in these areas under the Structural Adjustment Technical Assistance&#13;
Credit (SATAC), and is coordinating its work with other international agencies actively involved in the&#13;
energy sector in Georgia supporting the reforms, most notably USAID and the European Union. The&#13;
proposed project would support the stated objectives, and facilitate the on-going reforms in the power&#13;
sector.&#13;
1.39          A review of several decades of the World Bank's worldwide lending for the power&#13;
industry found a declining trend in the industry's overall technical, institutional, and financial&#13;
performance, mainly due to governmental failure to address the industry's fundamental structural&#13;
problems ("The World Bank's Role in the Electric Power Sector", a World Bank Policy Paper,&#13;
Washington, D.C., 1993). Conflicts between the government's role as policy maker in the sector and&#13;
as owner, regulator and operator of utilities have led to poorly defined and conflicting developmental,&#13;
commercial and social objectives, opaque comrnand and control management of the sector, inefficient&#13;
operation, lack of managerial and financial autonomy and poor financial performance. The review&#13;
recommended that Bank lending for electric power should focus on countries with a clear commitment&#13;
to improving the performance of the power industry by commercialization, corporatization, and&#13;
establishment of a transparent regulatory framework, clearly independent from power suppliers. A World&#13;
Bank Policy Paper "Energy Efficiency and Conservation in the Developing World" (Washington, D.C.,&#13;
1993) stated that the highest priorities, on the supply side, "...will be to make supply-side institutions&#13;
responsive through institutional and regulatory reform and to make investments in efficiency-enhancing&#13;
activities, such as plant rehabilitations and reducing transmission and distribution losses". The proposed&#13;
project is consistent with these policies.&#13;

The Project                                                                              15&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
2.1           The principal objectives of the project are to:&#13;
(i)   increase the operational capacity and electricity generation of the power system, reducing&#13;
shortages and improving the security, reliability and quality of power supply;&#13;
(ii)   stabilize electricity supply by increasing fuel reserves at Tbilsresi;&#13;
(iii)   establishment of Tbilsresi as a commercially independent and financially self-sufficient&#13;
generation company;&#13;
(iv)   improve the local capability and assist in:&#13;
(a)    project management;&#13;
(b)    corporate management and commercialization;&#13;
(c)    privatization of power enterprises.&#13;
B. Project Components and Description&#13;
2.2           The project consists of the following components:&#13;
(i)    Rehabilitation of a 300-MW  unit (unit 10) at the Gardabani thermal power plant,&#13;
operated by the Tbilsresi joint-stock company;&#13;
(ii)   Increase in working capital at Tbilsresi;&#13;
(iii)   Technical assistance to Tbilsresi for:&#13;
(a)    Project management;&#13;
(b)    Corporate management;&#13;
(c)    Development of a privatization strategy for the company.&#13;
2.3           Rehabilitation of unit 10 at the Gardabani Thermal Power Plant. Unit No. 10 (300&#13;
MW) although installed in 1994, is in a very poor condition, due to improper operation (unclean water,&#13;
low output, frequent start-ups and shut-downs, low and unstable system frequency, etc.). In addition,&#13;
a fire in January 1995 destroyed the instrumentation and control system of the unit. Inspection revealed&#13;
that replacement and repair of major components are necessary to restore the unit to the original design.&#13;
The rehabilitation will include: (i) repair of boiler heating surfaces and fuel burning systems; (ii) repair&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                                                   The Project&#13;
of intermediate and low pressure turbine rotor sections and turbine instrumentation; (iii) rehabilitation&#13;
of plant auxiliaries (pumps, motors, motorized valves, actuators, compressed air system, water treatment&#13;
system, steam pipes, fire extinguishing system, etc.); (iv) installation of a new instrumentation and&#13;
control system;  (v) rehabilitation of the electrical system (generator, excitation, cables, switches,&#13;
accumulators, lighting, etc.); (vi) miscellaneous (spare parts, engineering support, etc.).&#13;
2.4           Increase in Working Capital. The fuel to be financed by the working capital component&#13;
would be procured in two separate packages: the first, in the amount of US$10 million, would&#13;
retroactively finance fuel for the winter 1996/97, which has already been procured using Government&#13;
credit. The second fuel package would be procured toward the end of 1997, subject to compliance with&#13;
financial performance targets agreed during negotiations. The smaller allocation for the second winter&#13;
reflects the expected improvement in sector performance in 1997.&#13;
2.5           Reliable operation of the Gardabani thermal plant is of critical importance for operation&#13;
of the Georgian power system, particularly in winter months, due to:&#13;
(i)    increased demand during winter;&#13;
(ii)    progressively lower production of hydro plants in the November-March period, because&#13;
of lower inflows;&#13;
(iii)   low reliability ana frequent outages of other plants due to disrepair and lack of spare&#13;
parts;&#13;
(iv)   difficulties of importing electricity caused by lack of working capital, disrepair of&#13;
interconnection lines and their low reliability (especially of the main interconnection line&#13;
with Russia passing the Caucasus), and lower export capabilities in the neighboring&#13;
countries due to similar problems in their systems.&#13;
2.6           In this situation, an increase in fuel reserves at the Gardabani plant is vital for a stable&#13;
electricity supply during winter. Tbilsresi was established without adequate working capital to finance&#13;
its fuel inventories. Extending a loan to the plant to increase working capital would facilitate the&#13;
following objectives: (i) help Tbilsresi build up fuel reserves and stabilize generation at the Gardabani&#13;
plant and electricity supply; (ii) make the necessary adjustment in electricity prices and collections&#13;
(Chapter 111) more acceptable to the consumers; (iii) establish Tbilsresi as a commercially independent&#13;
and financially self-sufficient generation company; and (iv) support the ongoing power sector reform&#13;
through the transition period. Improved supply during winter would increase public tolerance of&#13;
increased tariffs and better enforcement of payment through disconnection of non-paying customers,&#13;
which are the main elements of the financial recovery of the sector, as well as major components of&#13;
sector reforms.&#13;
2.7           The working capital funds, financed by the IDA credit, would be used for increasing the&#13;
inventory of fuel to maintain a 30-day production reserve for 600-MW capacity at the Gardabani thermal&#13;
plant (equivalent to generating about 430 GWh of electricity). To sustain benefits of better availability&#13;
stemming from increased fuel reserves, the plant will be expected to keep them as a combination of mazut&#13;
inventory and funds earmarked for purchase of natural gas, kept in a special account or as a pre-paid gas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                              17&#13;
supply. The 30-day reserve should be maintained throughout the November-February period each year,&#13;
with mazut portion of the reserves of not less than 65,000 tons.&#13;
2.8           Technical Services. This component includes the following activities:&#13;
(a)    Project Management and Implementation: support project management and&#13;
implementation, including training of the staff in modern project management&#13;
principles and techniques;&#13;
(b)    Corporate Management of Tbilsresi: strengthen management capacity using&#13;
internationally-experienced consultants and training, with specific emphasis on&#13;
corporate structure and staffing, sales contracting, financial management and&#13;
investment planning, operations management, and accounting and reporting.&#13;
(c)    Development and implementation of a privatization strategy for Tbilsresi,&#13;
including defining and building consensus on the optimal privatization&#13;
methodology, and advising on implementation of the strategy.&#13;
C. Project Context&#13;
2.9           The project was selected to address the most pressing problems in the Georgian power&#13;
system, and to maximize the impact of IDA's contribution. The project is consistent with IDA's energy&#13;
strategy to promote improvements in energy efficiency and adaptation of energy utilities to the&#13;
requirements of the market economy. The project fully supports the Government's reform program in&#13;
the power sector, whose main objectives, principles and policies are stated in the Letter of Sector&#13;
Development Policy (LSDP), which has been discussed during preparation of the project, and was&#13;
finalized at negotiations (paras. 6.1(1)).  The reforms have begun in earnest by issuance of the&#13;
Presidential Decree on Power Sector Reforms (see Annex 2). The Decree stipulates preparation of an&#13;
electricity law, which would establish legal basis for new institutional organization -- including&#13;
establishment of an independent regulatory agency -- and commercialization and privatization of the&#13;
power industry. The Energy Law was presented to the Parliament on May 6, 1997. The Government&#13;
is also seriously pursuing privatization of the sector, and a general privatization decree of the power&#13;
industry was issued in December 1996. During credit negotiations, agreement was reached with the&#13;
Government to prepare a privatization plan for Tbilsresi, acceptable to IDA -- by June 30, 1998, and&#13;
begin implementing this strategy by December 31, 1998 (para. 6.1 (g)). The project is also consistent&#13;
with the limited Country Assistance Strategy, which identifies the energy sector as a key constraint to&#13;
economic development, and recognizes the need for rehabilitation of energy infrastructure and for policy&#13;
and institutional strengthening of the sector.&#13;
2.10          The Gardabani thermal power plant, as the only major thermal plant in operation in&#13;
Georgia, plays a crucial role in meeting electricity demand. Unit 10 will add 1700-1900 GWh annually&#13;
(more than 25% of total domestic generation in 1995). The plant is strategically located in eastern&#13;
Georgia near the largest load center (Tbilisi), and is a base-load plant, complementing the hydro plants&#13;
located mainly in the western part of the country and providing intermediate and peaking capacity. In&#13;
the absence of unit 10, units 1-8 -- which are old, very inefficient and costly to maintain -- have to be&#13;
used, since unit 9 alone would not be sufficient to meet the demand. Unit 10 is relatively new, can be&#13;
restored to its original parameters, and is expected to be much more efficient than the old units.&#13;
Economic analysis (Chapter V) shows a high rate of return from the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                               The Project&#13;
2.11          The Government increased residential electricity tariffs from 2.0 UScents/kWh to 2.6&#13;
UScents/kWh on January 1, 1997. A further increase in residential tariffs planned for June 1997 will&#13;
bring electricity tariffs for all consumer categories to the same level of 3.5 UScents/kWh, sufficient to&#13;
cover cash operating costs and depreciation. Through a more strict policy of disconnecting non-payers,&#13;
the average overall collection rate was increased from about 20% in 1995 to 53% in 1996. Additional&#13;
fuel purchases for this winter, to be retroactively financed through the IDA credit, resulted in a tangible&#13;
improvement in electricity supply, which made the harsh measures of increasing tariffs and enforcing&#13;
payments through disconnections socially and politically acceptable.&#13;
2.12          Low collections from households -- 27% average for 1996 -- in large part caused by&#13;
limited affordability, are the main reason for still low overall collection rates. Further improvements will&#13;
require a significant effort to enforce full payment discipline in the residential sector over the next two&#13;
years. Taking into account the lack of alternative energy sources, low household incomes and the&#13;
inadequacy of the social safety net, it would not be realistic to expect collection rates higher than 75 %&#13;
and 85% in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Without including the working capital component in the&#13;
proposed credit, further deterioration in the reliability of supply would be unavoidable in the short run.&#13;
This would make it more difficult to implement the planned price and collection increases and other&#13;
reform measures, undermining the effort to restore the financial viability of the power industry. The&#13;
energy crisis would continue to worsen, forestalling and reversing economic recovery, with serious&#13;
political and social consequences.&#13;
2.13          The Investment Program. This project is part of a priority investment programn in the&#13;
power sector which the Government of Georgia and former Sakenergo identified with assistance from&#13;
various multilateral and bilateral organizations (World Bank, KfW, EBRD, USAID, OECF of Japan,&#13;
Government of Switzerland, Government of Italy, etc.). The program includes: rehabilitation of: (i) a&#13;
300-MW unit (no. 9 and 10) at the Gardabani thermal plant, and the Gardabani water treatment plant;&#13;
(ii) six hydropower plants (Khrami II, Vartsikhe, Tkhibuli, Lajanuri, Rioni, Inguri); (iii) system dispatch&#13;
and control; (iv) cormmunications; (v) several key transmission substations and distribution networks,&#13;
including electricity metering. The components of the investment program which are still to be&#13;
implemented, with a total cost estimated at about US$183 million, have been segmented into a number&#13;
of separate projects which are, or are planned to be, financed by the various institutions, as described in&#13;
Annex 5.&#13;
D. Participatory Approach&#13;
2.14          The project, as well as the entire investment program, have been widely discussed with&#13;
the power industry's management and experts, as well as with Government officials and consumer&#13;
groups. Several meetings, conferences and seminars involving main stakeholders (Tbilsresi, Sakenergo,&#13;
Government ministries, managers and experts of the facilities included in the project, management of&#13;
distribution organizations, members of the Parliament and environmental non-governmental organizations,&#13;
representatives of major industries, administrators of local regions, etc.) were held to discuss project&#13;
objectives and priorities, as well as general problems in power sector performance and organization.&#13;
The proposal for the project originated in the power industry, and was strongly supported by the&#13;
Government, ensuring a strong sense of ownership. This participatory approach will continue to be&#13;
employed during project implementation as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                             19&#13;
E. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.15          The Gardabani thermal power plant is limited by the Ministry of Environment to a&#13;
maximum size of 2000 MW. The total name-plate capacity of the plant's ten units is 1850 MW;&#13;
however, five of the 8 older 150-MW units (units no. 1-8) are out of commission, so that the total&#13;
nominal capacity of the plant after unit 10 has been rehabilitated will be 1050 MW -- well within the&#13;
limits set by the Ministry of Environment. The plant must also operate within specific emission limits&#13;
(as part of its "ecological passport") and is charged a "user fee" of approximately 12,000 lari per year&#13;
for its gaseous emissions within the "passport" limits. If the plant were to operate in excess of the&#13;
permitted emission limits, it would pay a penalty of up to 5 times this "user fee" for each episode.&#13;
2.16          The Project has been assigned a "B" environmental ranking. The Project is anticipated&#13;
to have a positive environmental impact by improving efficiency of the Gardabani Unit 10. Power from&#13;
this unit would substitute for the inefficient and more polluting older units, two of which (out of the three&#13;
remaining) are scheduled for closure or rehabilitation once Unit 10 resumes operation. An environmental&#13;
assessment has been prepared and reviewed by the Ministry of Environment (Annex 6). The assessment&#13;
found that operation of Unit 10 would not result in violation of ambient air quality standards, provided&#13;
that mazut comprised no more than 40% of the fuel mix (natural gas being the other component of the&#13;
fuel), and that the sulfur content of the mazut did not exceed 3%.  IDA proposes the following&#13;
environmental management measures: (i) mazut should not comprise more than 40% of the fuel mix; (ii)&#13;
concentration of sulfur in mazut should not exceed 2%. Acceptance of these measures was reached&#13;
during negotiations and recorded in the Minutes of negotiations. The fuel specifications are expected to&#13;
result in emission compliant with the following World Bank guidelines, which limit emission of sulphur&#13;
dioxide to ambient standards of 100 milligrams per cubic meter (annual average of 24-hrs means), and&#13;
to 24-hrs maximum of 500 milligrams per cubic meter. In addition, the following emission standards of&#13;
the World Bank guidelines are expected to be met: emission of sulphur dioxide limited to 500 tons per&#13;
day for unpolluted areas (background level less than 50 milligrams per cubic meter), and to 100 tons per&#13;
day for polluted area with the background level more than 100 milligrams per cubic meter), with linear&#13;
interpolation between these limits.&#13;
F. Enviromnental Monitoring&#13;
2.17          It will be necessary to undertake an ambient air quality monitoring program to ensure the&#13;
effectiveness of the management measures taken to mitigate environmental impacts, and to ensure that&#13;
unforeseen impacts do not jeopardize expected project benefits. The location of sample sites should be&#13;
determined with the assistance of the ambient air quality modeling (points where expected elevated&#13;
SOx/NOx concentrationa are near human settlements or environmentally sensitive areas). The Regional&#13;
Environmental Monitoring Center should also be consulted in regard to the sample sites and sampling&#13;
frequency.&#13;
2.18          Tbilsresi does not, at present, have the staff, equipment or training needed to undertake&#13;
a long-term monitoring program. Equipment needed to implement the environmental monitoring program&#13;
will be procured as part of the project. The monitoring program will be developed with the assistance&#13;
of an expatriate consultant, financed under a PHRD grant (draft Terms of Reference in Annex 6). A copy&#13;
of the environmental monitoring program, satisfactory to IDA, should be submitted to IDA by August 31,&#13;
1997 (para 6.1 (a)).&#13;

G. Cost Estimate and Financing&#13;
2.19          Project Cost: Total project costs, based on October 1996 prices, and including physical&#13;
and price contingencies, are estimated at US$75.8 million equivalent, of which US$71 million equivalent&#13;
is the foreign exchange cost. Physical contingencies were estimated at about 12% of base cost. Price&#13;
contingencies for foreign costs were estimated using an average price increase of 2.3 % per year. Price&#13;
contingencies for local costs were estimated by using the projected local inflation and price changes (10%&#13;
in 1997, 7% in 1998, and 6.2% in 1999). Based on information from the Ministry of Finance that&#13;
imports of equipment under the proposed project would be exempt from duties and value-added taxes,&#13;
these have not been included in the cost estimate. A summary of project cost estimates is presented in&#13;
Table 2. 1; more detailed estimates are given in Annex 4.&#13;

2.20          Project financing. Financing arrangements are presented in Table 2.2. The proposed IDA&#13;
credit of US$52.3 million equivalent would cover about 69% of project costs and would be lent to Georgia&#13;
on standard IDA terms. The Government of Georgia would on-lend the Credit proceeds to the project&#13;
beneficiary, Tbilsresi, under a subsidiary loan agreement for a period of 20 years. Credit proceeds would&#13;
be on-lent at a variable annual interest rate, to be established by the Government by January 15 of each year,&#13;
equivalent to the prevailing IBRD variable lending rate for currency pool loans (as there is no functioning&#13;
market for long-term credit in Georgia at the present time). Corresponding to the estimated construction&#13;
period, a grace period of 3 years would be given to Tbilsresi (from signing of the subsidiary loan agreement)&#13;
during which the company would not be required to make principal or interest payments. Tbilsresi would&#13;
assume the foreign exchange risk and make payments to the Government in Georgia's national currency at&#13;
the prevailing relevant foreign exchange rate. Agreement on the proposed on-lending terms was reached&#13;
during negotiations (para. 6.1(1)). The draft subsidiary loan agreement was submitted to IDA before&#13;
negotiations; the signing of the subsidiary loan agreement is a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 6.2&#13;
(a)).&#13;
2.21          The project would be co-financed by the Government of Germany in the amount of DM30&#13;

of effectiveness (para 6.2 (b)). Tbilsresi would fund local costs, which would be mainly associated with&#13;
supplying some parts and with work to be carried out by force account or local contractors.&#13;

III. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
3.1           This chapter presents the financial condition and projections of Tbilsresi, the main credit&#13;
beneficiary, which was separated from the Sakenergogeneration company and registered as an independent&#13;
joint-stock corporation on November 29, 1996. Draft opening financial statements were reviewed and&#13;
finalized during negotiations and, as discussed below, agreement was reached with Tbilsresi on key&#13;
financial performance targets and the company's power sales agreement with Sakenergo.&#13;
3.2           Generation and transmission functions, previously integrated within Sakenergo, were&#13;
separated in mid-1996, as described in Chapter I (para. 1.30). Because the financial condition of&#13;
Tbilsresi will be affected by sector performance, financial data and projections for the power sector have&#13;
been compiled by consolidating projections for Sakenergogeneration and Sakenergo (transmission). The&#13;
bulk of distribution assets were spun off from Sakenergo in 1995 and are excluded from the financial&#13;
statements. Opening statements of June 30, 1996 were used to prepare a financial rehabilitation plan&#13;
aimed at restoring the financial health of the power sector over the next 2-3 y ears. A consultant study&#13;
on debt restructuring 'or the consoli-ated Sakenergo and Tbilsresi s available in project fiM.t. During&#13;
credit negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the key remaining actions of the&#13;
financial rehabilitation plan, electricity tariffs for 1997-98, mechanisms for continued improvement in&#13;
collections, and regulations on tariff-setting, accounting and audits.&#13;
A. Tbilsresi&#13;
3.3           As a part of Sakenergo, Tbilsresi's financial results were not reported separately.&#13;
Therefore, the company's financial condition and projections are based on opening financial statements&#13;
as of June 30, 1996, restated to an accruals basis, and on official closing statements for 1996. Accounts&#13;
receivable and payable have been written -off and restructured in accordance with the sector financial&#13;
rehabilitation plan (para. 3.20) and are reflected in the closing statements of December 31, 1996 and in&#13;
the financial projections. Given the sector's difficult financial condition, and the absence at this stage of&#13;
a suitable legal and regulatory framework, initial sales prices have been structured to cover projected cash&#13;
operating expenses, including debt-service, depreciation and local costs of the capital investment program.&#13;
These costs have been incorporated into a power sales agreement with Sakenergo, expected to be&#13;
Tbilsresi's main customer for the next 2-3 years. Compliance with supply and payment terms will be&#13;
monitored during project implementation. Revaluation/retirement of fixed assets, and profitability&#13;
margins, will be incorporated into the price structure in conjunction with the privatization of Tbilsresi,&#13;
a strategy for which is to be prepared by June 1998 (para. 2.9).&#13;
3.4            Financial Highlights.  The poor financial condition of Tbilsresi is reflective of the&#13;
condition of the sector as a whole. Over the last four years, insufficient revenues to cover even basic&#13;
operating and maintenance costs or fuel inventories has taken its toll on the physical and financial&#13;
condition of the plant. By 1995, available capacity had declined to only 14% of the installed capacity&#13;
of 1800 MW. As only the older, less efficient units were operated in 1995, net plant fuel efficiency&#13;
dropped to about 20%, compared with the design of about 27%. Poor collections resulted in Tbilsresi&#13;
having to take short-term loans of about 30% of net revenues during 1996 to finance working capital at&#13;
interest rates of 40-60%.&#13;

3.5           Although demand projections are prone to a higher than usual level of uncertainty given&#13;
the transitional nature of the economy, the prospects for Tbilsresi are good. The rehabilitation of the&#13;
newer units 9 and 10, and limited operation/retirement of older units, is expected to raise the plant's net&#13;
fuel efficiency to 32.3% in 1997, reducing direct generation costs from 8.8 tetri/kWh (US cents 7.0) in&#13;
1995 to around 3.6 tetri/kWh (US cents 2.5), excluding VAT, thereby making the plant competitive with&#13;
imports (expected to be priced in the US cents 4.0-5.0 range). Maintaining these improvements at the&#13;
plant level will require adequate (but competitive) tariffs, timely collections, and competent financial and&#13;
operations management. Highlights of the financial projections are presented in Table 3.1 and the main&#13;
assumptions discussed below. Detailed projections are presented in Annex 7.&#13;
3.6          Investment Program  and Business Plan.  A 3-year investment plan to improve&#13;
Tbilsresi's operating efficiency and market position has been agreed with the Government and is included&#13;
in the company's business plan (para. 4.25) and in the sector investment program (Annex 5).&#13;
Rehabilitation of Unit 9 (300 MW) was completed in 1996, with partial financing from KfW; upgrade&#13;
of the water treatment and auxiliary supply for Units 9 and 10 is being financed by EBRD and KfW; and&#13;
the rehabilitation of Unit 10 is to be financed by IDA (under the proposed project) and KfW. Units 3&#13;
and 8 of the older eight units (150 MW each) are to be maintained as reserves. No additional capital&#13;
investments are envisaged in the planning period and contract prices agreed with Sakenergo will be set&#13;
to allow Toilsresi to self-finance the local part of the proposed investment program (para. 3.13). The&#13;
Government has indicated that completion of Unit 11 (300 MW) by 2001-2, if justified, would be&#13;
undertaken by the private sector.&#13;
3.7           Capital costs. Fixed assets have not been revalued and depreciation allowance is an&#13;
average 3% of net asset value based on historical costs. However, not all assets have a market value,&#13;
either because of their age and condition, or because of lack of demand. An indicative revaluation of&#13;
useful assets is to be completed by June 1998 within the scope of technical services included for&#13;
management consulting. Assets are to be revalued in conjunction with Tbilsresi's privatization, for which&#13;
a strategy is to be prepared by June 1998 (para. 2.9). Depreciation based on revalued assets, and&#13;
profitability provisions are to be incorporated into the price structure by December 1998 (para. 3.13).&#13;
3.8           Operating costs. As indicated above, fuel efficiency is projected to improve from 20%&#13;
in 1995 to 33.7% when Unit 10 is recommissioned in 1999. It is assumed that gas will remain the fuel&#13;
of choice and that mazut will be used only in emergencies or if gas prices become uncompetitive.&#13;
Operating cost assumptions for 1997-2001 are summarized below:&#13;
(i)    Gas price: Plant gate prices of $70/thousand cubic meters (mcm), in current prices, have&#13;
been assumed. This is based on World Bank projections that European border prices will&#13;
remain at $92/mcm (in current US$), transportation costs will be about $30/mcm lower&#13;
than supply to Europe, and Georgian transport and handling costs will be $7-8/mcm;&#13;
(ii)    Labor costs: Based on trends already prevalent in the region, average wages are&#13;
projected to increase significantly in real terms. A 60% increase has been estimated&#13;
between 1996 and 1997, and about 20-25% annually between 1997 and 2001, equivalent&#13;
to a nominal increase in wages from Lari 55/month in 1996 to Lari 300/month in 2001.&#13;
Staffing levels are projected to decline by 10% per year over the next 3 years. More&#13;
reductions are possible as generation capacity is retired and the maintenance needs are&#13;
reduced for the rehabilitated units. Normal attrition has already reduced staffing from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial Analysis                                                                      25&#13;
1,000 to 860 over the last 3 years (260 in operations, 500 in maintenance, and 100 in&#13;
administrative positions). Labor costs are estimated to account for about 3% of total&#13;
costs. Staffing levels and the company's organizational structure will be more precisely&#13;
addressed under the management services included in the project; and&#13;
(iii)   Annual maintenance costs have been included only for the capacity for which demand&#13;
is projected. Unit 9 is not expected to require any major maintenance expense until 1998&#13;
and Unit 10 until 2000-1. Maintenance cost estimates provided by Tbilsresi are sufficient&#13;
for 1997-99 requirements, but are low (about half) for subsequent years compared with&#13;
international industry standards.  These estimates would be reviewed under the&#13;
management services included in the proposed project.&#13;
3.9          Interest and Debt-service coverage. Interest charges during construction have been&#13;
waived on state loans funded by EBRD, KfW, IDA and OECF and a grace period of 3 years has been&#13;
agreed for repayment of principal. Debt-service coverage is not expected to be a problem under the&#13;
projected scenario. However, during negotiations, it was agreed with Tbilsresi to maintain a debt-service&#13;
ratio coverage of at least 1.5 during the term of the IDA credit (para. 6.1 (b)).&#13;
3.10         Working Capital and Collections. With the provision of US$15 million of long-term&#13;
credit (under the proposed project) to finance about 60 days of fuel requirements, the need for expensive&#13;
short-term borrowing from the budget and commercial sources to finance working capital, is expected&#13;
to be virtually eliminated in 1997. US$10 million of the IDA credit will be used to retroactively finance&#13;
fuel supplied for the 1996-97 winter and US$5 million to partially cover any short-fall in working capital&#13;
for the 1997-98 winter (arising from payments from Sakenergo below 100% during 1997). If full&#13;
payments during 1997 reduce or eliminate the need for additional financing for fuel, the balance from&#13;
the US$5 million could be applied towards other plant investment needs.&#13;
3. 11         Given that Tbilsresi is the main generating plant in Georgia dependent on fuel imports,&#13;
and that the plant will have limited control over its revenues for the next few years, agreement was&#13;
reached with the Borrower and Tbilsresi during negotiations to:&#13;
(i)   take all actions necessary for Tbilsresi to be fully paid by Sakenergo for electricity&#13;
supplied at the rates established under the Power Purchase Agreement (para. 3.14)&#13;
between Sakenergo and Tbilsresi (para. 6. 1 (m));&#13;
(ii)   to treat as a grant at the end of each calendar year, in 1997 and 1998, that portion of&#13;
the sub-loan for financing working capital which the company is not paid for by&#13;
Sakenergo during the year (para. 6.1 (n)).&#13;
3.12         Accounts Receivable and Payable. As part of de-consolidation of sector enterprises and&#13;
financial restructuring, receivables and payables apportioned to Tbilsresi as of December 31, 1996,&#13;
consisting mainly of arrears from units of the former Sakenergo and dues for gas supply, were Lari 35.5&#13;
million and Lari 28.3 million respectively. This stock of receivables and payables is to be fully retired&#13;
by 1999 (para. 3.20 (v)). During negotiations, agreement was reached with Tbilsresi and the Borrower&#13;
to ensure that new accounts receivable and payable (from January 1, 1997) not exceed 90 days of sales&#13;
and expenses respectively by December 31, 1997 and 60 days by December 31, 1998 and 1999, and that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                                                                         Financial Analysis&#13;
the company maintain a current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of at least 1.3 during the term&#13;
of the credit (para. 6.1 (c)).&#13;
3.13          Tbilsresi Tariffs and Power Sales Agreement. Average sales prices for Tbilsresi,&#13;
estimated based on production and cost assumptions discussed above, are presented in Table 3.1. The&#13;
projected prices cover plant operating costs, depreciation (based on historical asset values), interest and&#13;
the local costs of on-going capital investments, but are sensitive to actual payments received from&#13;
Sakenergo, Tbilsresi's only customer. Inclusion of a bad-debt provision of 25 % of revenues incurred in&#13;
1997 would result in an increase of about 0.75 tetri/kWh in 1998. Projected prices are to be supported&#13;
by a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Sakenergo, Tbilsresi's main customer, which would include:&#13;
(i)    annual capacity and energy to be contracted, and proportion from old and new units;&#13;
(ii)   capacity charge and projected fixed costs covered by this charge (depreciation,&#13;
maintenance, interest, provisions for bad debts for the previous year, and wages);&#13;
(iii)   energy charge covering fuel costs (including fuel consumption per kWh) and other&#13;
variable costs, and provisions for adjustment;&#13;
(iv)   metering, reporting and auditing requirements;&#13;
(v)   invoicing requirements, supply and payment terms, and penalties and remedies for non-&#13;
compliance with the contract.&#13;
3.14          The key PPA elements defined above (para. 3.13) have been incorporated into the PPA&#13;
for 1997, signed by Sakenergo and Tbilsresi and approved by the Government's Regulatory Authority.&#13;
The PPA was submitted to IDA on March 15, 1997. During negotiations, agreement was also reached&#13;
for Tbilsresi to submit to IDA, not later than October 1, 1997, 1998 and 1999, for IDA's review and&#13;
approval, the PPA for the next calendar year approved by the Borrower's regulatory authority along with&#13;
supporting financial projections for the current and following fiscal years (balance sheet, income&#13;
statement and cash-flow statement (para. 6.1 (o)). Furthermore, the sales prices which will become&#13;
effective on January 1, 1998 and 1999 respectively, should be sufficient to at least cover reasonable&#13;
operating costs, depreciation, interest payments, and bad debts (defined as accounts receivable in excess&#13;
of 90 days), and allow the company to satisfy its debt service and current ratio covenants (para 6.1. (p)).&#13;
Signing of the PPA for 1998, agreed with IDA and approved by the sector Regulatory Authority, will be&#13;
a condition of disbursement for the remaining US$5 million for working capital (para. 6.3 (a)).&#13;
3.15          Corporate Management. As a newly-independent enterprise, Tbilsresi's management&#13;
needs to be strengthened through additional recruitment and technical services. The business plan&#13;
prepared for Tbilsresi identified the need to add and strengthen specific functions of financial&#13;
management, procurement and operations planning. Modern accounting systems also need to be added&#13;
to manage power sales contracts and to provide timely and useful information for management decisions.&#13;
Contracting of key experts is already underway (with donor financing) and a three-person "Cost&#13;
Efficiency Team" is expected to be in place by mid-1997. Provisions for additional technical services&#13;
are included in project costs; terms of reference will be agreed upon by June 1997 and necessary&#13;
consulting services contracted in coordination with other donor support.&#13;
3.16          Accounting and Reporting. Tbilsresi's financial statements presented in this report are&#13;
based on opening financial statements as of June 30, 1996 and closing statements for 1996, restated to&#13;
an accruals basis. Official statements are reported on a cash basis but a phased adoption of International&#13;
Accounting Standards (IAS) is expected to begin in 1997 in accordance with sector-wide rules and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial Analysis                                                                            27&#13;
scheduled to be defined by September 30, 1997 (para. 3.20 (vi)). Of particular issue are the rules for&#13;
treating rehabilitation expenses; present legislation requires these expenses to be treated as "maintenance"&#13;
costs and be expensed in the calendar year. Capitalization of rehabilitation costs needs to be supported&#13;
by legislation and is to be addressed during the preparation of sector accounting rules. In order to&#13;
monitor compliance with financial covenants under the proposed project, Tbilsresi will be required to&#13;
submit its audited financial statements to IDA by June 30 of each year (para. 4.20). Technical services&#13;
to assist with this restatement will be provided by the corporate management consultants hired under the&#13;
project.&#13;
B. Power Sector Financial Issues&#13;
3.17          The financial condition of the sector, as reflected by the consolidated statements of&#13;
Sakenergogeneration and Sakenergo, has deteriorated over the last few years owing to the following&#13;
interrelated causes:&#13;
(i)    electricity supplied and accounted for ("billings") has declined as a share of the power&#13;
supplied to final consumers (from around 90% in 1991 to 70% in 1995-6);&#13;
(ii)    collections, as a share of "billings", dropped to less than 20-25 % during 1993-95, largely&#13;
due to the reduced ability of consumers to pay, and have left the sector with a sizable&#13;
accumulation of arrears. For political reasons, electricity supplies to Abkhazia and South&#13;
Ossetia, constituting about 10-12% of total supply, cannot be discontinued for non-&#13;
payment. Non-payments are also high from large quasi-budgetary enterprises such as&#13;
water and sewerage companies, transportation, etc.;&#13;
(iii)   technical losses have increased due to under-maintenance of supply facilities, decline in&#13;
demand, and a higher share of household consumption. Reported technical losses for&#13;
1996 in transmission and distribution were about 20-22%;&#13;
(iv)   tariffs are set to nominally cover operating costs, but do not include adequate provisions&#13;
for high losses and arrears, which are often outside supplier control, or the higher costs&#13;
of deferred maintenance and capital replacement.&#13;
(v)    absence and/or inaccuracy of metering between sector enterprises and final consumers.&#13;
This is of particular importance given the separation of generation, transmission, and&#13;
distribution, and raises uncertainty over the quality of available data;&#13;
(vi)   insufficient incentives for enterprises to reduce supply costs and commercial losses, or&#13;
to improve accounting systems and general financial management.&#13;
3.18          Present Status and Actions Taken. The prospects for the sector improved in 1996.&#13;
State and sector authorities have acknowledged the importance of rehabilitating the financial condition&#13;
of sector enterprises in parallel with rehabilitation of physical assets. A special Commission, headed by&#13;
the First Deputy Minister of Finance, was created in September 1996 to develop measures to improve&#13;
payment discipline and to prepare a comprehensive financial rehabilitation plan for the power sector&#13;
aimed at restoring the sector's financial viability by 1999 (para 3.20).   The unbundling of sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                         Financial Analysis&#13;
enterprises has increased transparency and accountability, and is contributing to financial discipline. A&#13;
Presidential Decree (No. 363 of May 30, 1996) strengthens the legal basis for enforcing payment&#13;
discipline; financial recovery will be further aided through strengthening of the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework under the Electricity Law which was presented to Parliament on May 6, 1997. The&#13;
Government has already taken the following actions which have contributed to improving the sector's&#13;
financial prospects:&#13;
(i)    Collections, which are reported to IDA on a monthly basis, have increased from 35 % of&#13;
supply in January 1996 to 66% in December, with an average of 53% for the year,&#13;
excluding supply to Abkhazia and Ossetia. Collections were sustained at about 61 % in&#13;
January 1997, which is considered a lean month and typically has a 10-15% drop in&#13;
collections. Improvements have resulted largely from better organization and&#13;
accountability within sector enterprises, stricter application of disconnection policies, and&#13;
growing consumer awareness of the commercial nature of electricity supply;&#13;
(ii)   until targeting of vulnerable groups is improved"5, beginning from January 1997, the state&#13;
budget will make direct payments to Sakenergo of about Lari 3 million/month (or about&#13;
17% of projected 1997 revenue) to compensate for certain categories eligible for&#13;
subsidies under Georgian law. Compensations include: (i) 60 kWh/month of household&#13;
consumption in Abkhazia (Lari 300,000/month); (ii) consumption of 40 kWh/month by&#13;
934,000 pensioners (Lari 1.2 million/month); (iii) consumption of 40 kWh and 60 kWh&#13;
per month by migrant and settled refugees respectively (Lari 460,000/month); (iv)&#13;
consumption of 60 kWh/month by 360,000 employees of budgetary organizations (Lari&#13;
720,000/month); and (v) consumption by budgetary organizations (Lari 300,000 to&#13;
500,000/month).&#13;
(iii)   Presidential Order (No. 829 of December 19, 1996) raised residential tariffs from 2.5&#13;
tetri/kWh to 3.3 tetri/kWh on January 1, 1997, raising the average retail tariff to about&#13;
3.9 tetri/kWh and the wholesale tariff to about 3.0 tetri/kWh.&#13;
(iv)   Presidential Order (No. 826 of January 1997) defined the actions taken to regulate&#13;
financial relations between the power sector and the rest of the economy and to&#13;
restructure sector debts. Sakenergo's receivables and payables as of June 30, 1996 were&#13;
reduced by about 50% (from Lari 285.0 million and Lari 285.9 million respectively to&#13;
Lari 138.9 million and Lari 142.3 million) through conversion into sovereign debt to&#13;
Turkmenistan and Iran (Lari 96 million) and transfer of past receivables from Abkhazia&#13;
and South Ossetia (Lari 47.6 million) to Energia-Plus, a limited liability company which&#13;
has also assumed the liability of repaying Russia for past supplies to Abkhazia. Future&#13;
supplies from Russia to Abkhazia, which in the past were billed to Sakenergo, will now&#13;
be billed to Energia-Plus. Settlement of these accounts is expected to be part of the&#13;
political settlement of the Abkhazian dispute. In addition short-term credits to Sakenergo&#13;
from the Ministry of Finance (Lari 15.4 million) and the National Bank (lari 4.2 million)&#13;
made in mid-1996 have been rescheduled for repayment over the next 2 years. Actions&#13;
15    The Government ordered the relevant authorities to complete the identification of the poorest households by March&#13;
1997 with the purpose of preparing a program to better target subsidies.&#13;

Financial Analysis                                                                            29&#13;
already taken and those proposed are reflected in Table 3.3 showing the dynamics of debt&#13;
reduction.&#13;
(v)    Of Sakenergo's remaining receivables and payables as of June 30, 1996, Lari 112 million&#13;
of receivables (81 %) and Lari 105 million of payables (74 %) have been rescheduled and&#13;
are supported by signed agreements (113 in number) and are to be retired over 2 years,&#13;
beginning in the 2nd quarter of 1997.&#13;
3.19          Financial highlights of the power sector, as represented by Sakenergo's consolidated&#13;
financial statements (generation and transmission) are summarized in Table 3.2 and detailed in Annex 7.&#13;
For 1996, the main conclusion is that, on an accruals basis, the sector has a positive operating income&#13;
but is loss-making because of accumulated bad debts.&#13;

3.20           Financial Rehabilitation Plan. Risks remain high that the improved payment discipline&#13;
of the last few months will not be sustained and collection targets will not be met. These risks are&#13;
contributed to by budgetary constraints, the condition of the economy, the need for a political settlement&#13;
of the conflict over Abkhazia (which is both a source of 30-40% of Georgia's power supply and a&#13;
consumer of about 12% of production), and difficulties in enforcing collections from residential&#13;
consumers (accounting for 50-55 % of national consumption) without sizeable investments in distribution&#13;
and metering, and a better targeted social safety program. The actions already taken by the Government,&#13;
agreed under the proposed project and to be included under the second Structural Adjustment Credit&#13;
currently under preparation, are designed to mitigate against these risks.  Furthermore, during&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached with the Borrower on a Financial Rehabilitation Plan (FRP) for&#13;
Sakenergo, including specific financial covenants, to be monitored through quarterly reports submitted&#13;
by the Borrower to IDA (para 6.1 (h)). The FRP objectives are to: (i) improve collections; (ii) revise&#13;
tariffs to full-cost recovery levels with incentives to reduce supply costs; and (iii) retire the receivable&#13;
and payable arrears that had accumulated on Sakenergo's and Tbilsresi's balance sheets (as reflected in&#13;
the consolidated statements of December 31, 1996). Key elements of the Financial Rehabilitation Plan,&#13;
to be implemented over the next 2 years, include:&#13;
(i)    Payments from state enterprises serving national interests (estimated to account for&#13;
5-6 % of national electricity consumption). To improve payments by these enterprise, by&#13;
June 30, 1997, the Government will issue a decree which: (a) lists the state enterprises&#13;
deemed to be of national importance and which cannot be disconnected in the event of&#13;
non-payment for electricity supplies; (b) defines the actions to be taken by the suppliers&#13;
to secure payment from these enterprises; and (c) defines the remedies available to the&#13;
suppliers to secure timely payment in the event of non-payment by the enterprise.&#13;
(ii)    Collection targets. It was agreed at negotiations that, through the above mechanisms and&#13;
on-going reorganization of sector enterprises, all actions would be taken to ensure that&#13;
Sakenergo's average collections for the year (excluding from Abkhazia) are raised to at&#13;
least 70% of supply by December 31, 1997, 85% by December 31, 1998 and 90% by&#13;
December 31, 1999 (para. 6.1 (i));&#13;
(iii)    Supplies to Abkhazia and South Ossetia will be billed to Energia-Plus (para. 3.18 (iv))&#13;
and non-payments for this supply, together with historical arrears, will be settled as part&#13;
of the overall political settlement over these two regions.&#13;
(iv)    Electricity Tariffs: By end-1997, electricity tariffs are to be set by an independent&#13;
regulator based on the government's tariff policy, accounts submitted by sector&#13;
enterprises, and other auditing and licensing procedures. The adoption of an Electricity&#13;
Law and the creation of a suitable regulatory framework, and technical services to be&#13;
provided under the proposed project, will better define the methodology and rules for&#13;
tariff-setting'6. In parallel with refinement of the tariff methodology, it was agreed&#13;
during negotiations to:&#13;
16     Average wholesale tariffs are estimated at 3.3 tetri/kWh (cost-recovery tariff, including an average generation cost&#13;
of 2.1 tetri/KWh, VAT, technical losses of about 12% and provisions for bad-debts equivalent to 25% of gross revenues); it&#13;
does not take into account the revaluation of assets. Average generation cost is based on the 1996 supply mix (hydro - 78%,&#13;
thermal - 19%, and imports - 3%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial Analysis                                                                       31&#13;
a.    increase average residential tariffs to 4.5 tetri/kWh by June 30, 1997 (para 6.1&#13;
(j)fi)) at which time the average wholesale tariff will be 3.5 tetri/kWh and will&#13;
fully cover operating and maintenance costs, depreciation based on historical&#13;
asset values, interest on borrowed capital, and partial provisioning for bad debts;&#13;
b.     by September 30, 1997, the Government (and the regulatory authority) would&#13;
issue a decree defining the rules for setting regulated electricity prices, and the&#13;
schedule to achieve full recovery of reasonable costs and eliminate any remaining&#13;
cross-subsidies between different categories of consumers by December 31, 1998.&#13;
The decree would include rules for asset revaluation, depreciation, profit levels,&#13;
allowances for technical losses and writing off of bad debts;&#13;
c.    by December 31, 1998 set regulated tariffs to at least cover all operating and&#13;
maintenance costs, interest on borrowed capital, full provisioning for bad debts,&#13;
and depreciation based on revalued assets (para 6.1 ( ) (ii));&#13;
d.    to the extent that other measures have not been effective in securing payments&#13;
from Abkhazia, South Ossetia and state enterprises of national interests,&#13;
Sakenergo's average wholesale tariffs effective on January 1, 1998 and 1999 will&#13;
be set to recover unpaid electricity bills (defined as accounts overdue by more&#13;
than 90 days) for the previous year from these entities (para. 6.1 j ( iii))).&#13;
(v)    Retirement of arrears. Supported by debt rescheduling agreements already signed and to be&#13;
negotiated over the next few months, it was agreed at negotiations that Sakenergo's remaining&#13;
accounts receivable and payable, equivalent to Lari 138.9 million and Lari 142.3 million&#13;
respectively, and Tbilsresi's remaining accounts receivable and payable, equivalent to Lari 35.5&#13;
million and Lari 28.3 million (as of December 31, 1996) will be retired (through collections and&#13;
repayment) according to the following schedule: at least 35% of historical receivables and&#13;
payables by December 31, 1997, 50% by December 31, 1998 and the remainder by December&#13;
31, 1999.&#13;
(vi)   Accounting and Taxation. In order to harmonize the power sector's accounting rules with&#13;
International Accounting Standards (IAS), and to coordinate accounting reforms in the rest of the&#13;
economy, by September 30, 1997, the Government will issue regulations governing accounting,&#13;
reporting and auditing requirements of the power sector, and the schedule to fully adopt these&#13;
regulations. Specifically, the regulations will define rules for asset revaluation and depreciation&#13;
allowance, provisioning for bad debts, tax rates and treatment of value-added and other taxes&#13;
(including on bad debts), and interest payments on short and long-term debt.&#13;

Project Implementation                                                                  33&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
4.1          Implementation of the project will be the responsibility of Tbilsresi (the credit&#13;
beneficiary). Tbilsresi will maintain a Project Management Unit (PMU), which could be a separate&#13;
consulting company. It was agreed at negotiations to maintain the PMU headed by an individual whose&#13;
qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA and ensure that the PMU is staffed with sufficient&#13;
personnel with adequate qualifications (para 6.1(d)). The responsibilities of the PMU will include&#13;
engineering, commercial and contractual aspects of the project (engineering design, procurement, contract&#13;
administration, scheduling and coordination of project activities, supervision, acceptance, dispute&#13;
resolution, financial management, disbursement, reporting). In case the PMU is contracted out to a&#13;
consulting company, Tbilsresi will retain direct responsibilities for the key decisions: major procurement&#13;
decisions, contract signing, acceptance of the works and equipment, clearance of disbursement requests.&#13;
The PMU will be staffed with sufficient personnel, including a deputy project manager, a procurement&#13;
coordinator, specialists for various equipment categories (boiler, turbine, electrical equipment, auxiliaries,&#13;
instrumentation and control), a financial officer, interpreters/translators and secretaries. Tbilsresi may&#13;
depute some of its staff to the PMU. Main specialists and other key staff (procurement coordinator,&#13;
financial officer) with qualifications satisfactory to IDA, were appointed in April 1997.&#13;
4.2           Neither the project beneficiary nor local staff of the PMU have experience with&#13;
implementing IDA-financed projects. To supplement expertise presently not available (particularly in&#13;
project management, procurement, preparation of technical specifications and bidding documents, bid&#13;
evaluation, contracting, processing withdrawal applications, and project accounting and reporting), the&#13;
PMU will be assisted by qualified international and local consultants. Financing of these services is&#13;
included in the project budget. A qualified international consultant, assisted by a local specialist, has&#13;
been hired to prepare the bidding documents and assist Tbilsresi in conducting the procurement process.&#13;
IDA will also arrange for procurement and disbursement seminars to be held in Georgia to train the staff&#13;
of Tbilsresi, the PMU, and staff of Governmental organizations.&#13;
B. Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.3           The project would be implemented over FY1997-2000. The Project completion date is&#13;
December 31, 1999, and the project closing date is June 30, 2000. A detailed implementation schedule,&#13;
showing activity by project component is in Annex 9. Consulting services started in October 1996 with&#13;
preparation of bid documents, under financing from KfW. Bid documents were published in January&#13;
1997, and the bidding process is expected to be closed before effectiveness of the IDA credit.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
4.4           Procurement Arrangements. Major project elements, their estimated costs and proposed&#13;
procurement methods are given in Table 4.1, and the list of procurement packages is in Annex 10.&#13;
Procurement financed by IDA Credit would be carried out in accordance with Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995, revised January and August 1996, and using World&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                                          Project Implementation&#13;
Bank Standard Bidding Documents. Procurement financed by KfW and executed as parallel financing,&#13;
will follow KfW's procurement rules.&#13;
4.5            Equipment.  All equipment financed by the IDA  Credit (US$36.5 million) for&#13;
rehabilitation of the Gardabani unit #10 -- except equipment for environmental monitoring -- would be&#13;
tendered through ICB as one single-responsibility supply and install contract. Environmental monitoring&#13;
equipment would be bought through international shopping. Instrumentation and control equipment will&#13;
be financed by KfW, and supplied and installed by Siemens"7. The Client, with assistance of an&#13;
expatriate consultant, will be responsible for coordinating the work of the IDA-financed contractor with&#13;
Siemens. Tbilsresi, the beneficiary, will provide some material, and also make available their personnel&#13;
to the contractor for use in some of the work (demolition, site preparation, some erection, etc.)&#13;
4.6            Commodities.  Natural gas purchase financed by the IDA Credit (US$15.0 million)&#13;
would be procured through direct contracting for imports of natural gas from Turkmenistan. This&#13;
procurement method is justified by the following reasons:&#13;
(i)    Georgia receives natural gas through a pipeline which comes from  Russia over the&#13;
Caucasus, which is the only route in operation; and&#13;
(ii)    Traditional supplier of natural gas to Georgia (and to all Caucasus countries -- Georgia,&#13;
Armenia, Azerbaijan), has been Turkmenistan, rather than Russia, owing to the fact that&#13;
location of the gas fields in the region relative to the consumption centers, and&#13;
configuration of the existing pipelines, makes Turkmenistan the lowest-cost supplier.&#13;
4.7            Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing.  Out of the proposed credit, the&#13;
Borrower has proposed to use up to SDR 7.1 million (about US$10 million equivalent, 19.1 % of the&#13;
proposed credit) for advance procurement and retroactive financing of fuel (natural gas). Such advance&#13;
procurement is considered necessary by the Borrower to finance increase in fuel reserves and stabilize&#13;
power supply during the winter of 1996/97.&#13;
4.8            Consultant Services. Consultants for project implementation and management will be&#13;
financed under the IDA Credit and KfW loan. The consultants financed by the IDA Credit would be&#13;
selected in accordance with the Guidelines for the use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
the World Bank as an Executing Agency, August 1981, through short-listing of firms.&#13;
4.9         Tbilsresi (the project implementation agency) has a very limited knowledge of international&#13;
commercial practices and IDA's procurement procedures (para. 4.2). The PMU, with support from&#13;
qualified international consultants, will handle the procurement activities under the project.  The&#13;
procurement team will receive training during the early stages of project implementation, both from IDA&#13;
and from the international consultant. A project launch workshop, to be held in June 1997, will provide&#13;
procurement training for Tbilsresi, the PMU, and MOFE staff.&#13;
17     In 1996 Siemens installed instrumentation and control equipment for unit #9, which is identical to unit #10 and with&#13;
which it shares the control room. To maintain compatibility of the equipment and minimize operating and maintenance costs,&#13;
Siemens will install the same equipment on unit #10. Contract for unit #9 was awarded to Siemens in 1995 under a competitive&#13;
tendering limited to German suppliers, since the project was financed by the Government of Germany through KfW.&#13;

4.10        Notification: A General Procurement Notice (GPN) was published in Development Business&#13;
in November 1996. A Specific Procurement Notice was published in Development Business on&#13;
December 31, 1996, for the large supply and install contract for rehabilitation of unit No. 10 at the&#13;
Gardabani thermal plant.&#13;

4.11        Prior Review: Prior review will apply to all ICB contracts (US$300,000 and above), and&#13;
to all IDA-financed contracts awarded by direct contracting. This will result in 100% percent of the total&#13;
value of IDA-financed goods being subject to prior review. The terms of reference for all consulting&#13;
assignments financed by IDA would be subject to IDA's prior review. Any consulting contract in excess&#13;
of US$ 100,000 for firms and US$ 50,000 for individuals would also be subject to IDA's prior review&#13;
procedures. Terms of Reference are to be reviewed for all contracts.&#13;
4.12 Procurement information will be collected by the PMU and reported to IDA as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                                     Project Implementation&#13;
(i)  prompt reporting of bidding, bid evaluation results in the standard form and contract award&#13;
information; and&#13;
(ii)  quarterly reports indicating: (i) progress and problems in project implementation; (ii)&#13;
revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates&#13;
for physical and price contingencies; and (iii) revised schedules of procurement actions,&#13;
including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual contracts.&#13;
D. Disbursement&#13;
4.13 The proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed over three years (1997-1999), against the categories&#13;
shown on the following table:&#13;

TOTAL                        52.3&#13;
4.14          A detailed disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 11.  Based upon credit&#13;
effectiveness by May 1997, the project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1999. The closing&#13;
date for the proposed project would be June 30, 2000.&#13;
4.15          The expenditures for contracts for goods valued at US$ 300,000 or less, contracts for&#13;
consulting firms valued at US$ 100,000 or less and contracts for individual consulting services valued&#13;
at US$ 50,000 or less may be financed on the basis of statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures. The&#13;
supporting documentation for these contracts would not be sent to IDA, but would be retained by the&#13;
borrower for inspection by supervision missions and by external auditors. All other disbursements would&#13;
be fully documented. The minimum size of applications for direct withdrawals from the Credit Account&#13;
and for issuance of Special Commitments will be 20% of the current amount of the authorized allocation.&#13;
4.16          Retroactive Financing. As stated in para. 4.7, the Borrower has proposed to use up to&#13;
SDR 7.1 million ( about US$10 million equivalent, 19.1 % of the credit) for advance procurement and&#13;
retroactive financing of fuel. All retroactive financing is expected to be within the maximum period of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation                                                               37&#13;
12 months prior to the expected date of Credit Agreement signing. The exception to the limit of 10%&#13;
for retroactive financing was approved by IDA.&#13;
4.17         Special Account: To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a&#13;
Special Account in a major foreign commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA to cover&#13;
IDA's share of expenditures. The Authorized Allocation would be US$1,000,000. During the early&#13;
stage of the project, the initial allocation to the Special Account would be limited to US$500,000.&#13;
However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached the level of SDR8.7 million&#13;
(about US$12 million), the initial allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of&#13;
US$1,000,000 by submitting the relevant Application for withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of&#13;
the Special Account would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn,&#13;
whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard IDA&#13;
procedure as described in Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the Special&#13;
Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests.&#13;
E. Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.18         A project launch mission would take place in June 1997. The PMU would prepare&#13;
quarterly progress reports showing the physical progress of the project, procurement status, costs incurred&#13;
and anticipated, disbursements made, administrative aspects and institutional performance. The quarterly&#13;
reports should be submitted to the IDA one month after the end of each quarter. A "mid-term" review&#13;
is scheduled for May 1998 for which the beneficiary would prepare a report which, in addition to the&#13;
information provided by quarterly reports, would contain monitorable performance indicators (Annex 12)&#13;
and an assessment of how the project meets the overall project objectives and benefits. The mid-term&#13;
report should be submitted to the IDA by end of April, 1998.&#13;
4.19        In order to monitor the financial performance of Tbilsresi under the project, an audit of&#13;
its financial statements by auditors acceptable to IDA would be required. The audit reports would also&#13;
contain separate opinions on compliance with all financial covenants under the IDA Credit.&#13;
4.20         The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-related&#13;
accounts also will be maintained in accordance with IAS. The PMU will be responsible for maintaining&#13;
the necessary records concerning the project accounts, while Tbilsresi accounting department will be&#13;
responsible for maintaining its accounts. In accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines, audits will be carried&#13;
out simultaneously for statements of expenditure (SOEs) against which disbursements have been made&#13;
or are due to be made out of the credit proceeds, and specific reference to the Special Account and SOEs&#13;
will be made in the audit reports accompanying the financial statements. During negotiations, agreement&#13;
was reached that each year Tbilsresi will submit to IDA the auditors' reportfor Tbilsresi and its audited&#13;
financial statements, the audited financial statements restated in accordance with US, and the audit&#13;
report for the Special Account, project account, and SOEs for each fiscal year, not later than six months&#13;
after the close of such year (para. 6.1 (q)).&#13;
4.21         During negotiations, an agreement was reached with the Borrower to provide monthly&#13;
electricity balance data, and billing, collections and payment arrears data both at the wholesale and retail&#13;
sale levels (para. 6.1 tk)). Upon establishment of the Electricity Regulating Commission, the later would&#13;
be expected to review these statements before submission to IDA.&#13;
&#13;

4.22          An implementation completion report (ICR), prepared by the PMU, will be submitted to&#13;
IDA promptly after the completion of the project but not later than 6 months of Credit closing date. The&#13;
ICR will discuss execution of the project, its costs and benefits, the performance of the borrower, the&#13;
performance of IDA and other cofinanciers and lessons learned.&#13;
4.23          In addition to the review  of procurement actions, quarterly reports and other&#13;
documentation, three supervision missions are planned annually. The project is expected to require the&#13;
total supervision effort of about 111 staff-weeks spread over four fiscal years. Annex 13 summarizes&#13;
the proposed supervision plan.&#13;
4.24          Project Monitoring Indicators and Mid-Term Review. Project monitoring indicators&#13;
include those related to: (i) the financial rehabilitation of the power sector, (ii) physical implementation&#13;
of the project's components, and (iii) increased operating efficiency and reduction of losses. A list of&#13;
indicators is presented in Annex 12. Agreement on the project monitoring indicators was reached at&#13;
negotiations (para. 6.1 (e)). It was also agreed that the Borrower and Tbilsresi will prepare quarterly&#13;
progress reports, which would include selected indicators and a mid-term project implementation report&#13;
by April 1998, and an implementation completion report by June 30, 2000 (para 6.1(r)). Time-based&#13;
actions presented in the implementation schedule will also be monitored.&#13;
F. Operation&#13;
4.25          Following project completion, the life of the unit 10 at the Gardabani thermal plant should&#13;
be extended for 15-20 years. Technical measures have been taken in the design of rehabilitation program&#13;
to prevent operation of the unit (and the entire plant) under sub-standard conditions. To ensure proper&#13;
operation, contractors involved in rehabilitation of unit 10 will be required to train personnel at the plant&#13;
in operation and maintenance. Training of the staff in plant operation was also provided as part of&#13;
rehabilitation of unit 9 in 1996. A new water treatment facility, financed by EBRD, is scheduled for&#13;
completion by the end of 1997. Technical assistance for business management of Tbilsresi company, to&#13;
assist the company's management in improving operation of the plant and management of the company,&#13;
is provided under the project. Tbilsresi's strategy to improve its technical and financial operations was&#13;
included in its draft Business Plan submitted to IDA before negotiations. Specifically, the business plan&#13;
covers: (i) the company's opening financial statements and projections for the next 5 years; (ii) a detailed&#13;
investment plan for 1997-99 and an indicative investment plan for the rest of the planning period; and&#13;
(iii) a strategy to strengthen company management, reporting and auditing which is to be supported by&#13;
the proposed project and will continue the efforts started under the EBRD-financed power rehabilitation&#13;
project. During negotiations, agreement was reached to submit to IDA the Business Plan for Tbilsresi&#13;
by June 30, 1997 and to consult IDA prior to making any revisions to the plan or undertaking any actions&#13;
not included in the plan (para. 6.1 (s)). Tbilsresi will take all necessary measures, in particular, to&#13;
operate the plant according to the technical standards of operation.&#13;

Project Benefits and Risks                                                                       39&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1            The main benefits of the project are the restoration of the Gardabani unit #10 and the&#13;
consequent improvements in the capacity, efficiency and availability of the plant, resulting in increased&#13;
electricity generation and more reliable power supply, improved supply quality and security, and reduced&#13;
electricity imports. The injection of working capital and better fuel supply and increased fuel reserves would&#13;
also result in reduced electricity shortages, less rationing and a more stable supply allowing more discipline&#13;
in rationing of electricity to the extent that it would have to be applied. Technical assistance under the&#13;
project would improve capability of the industry to manage internationally financed projects, improve&#13;
corporate management at the Gardabani power company, and help in its privatization.&#13;
B. Project Financial Analysis&#13;
5.2            We did a discounted cash flow analysis on Gardabani and on the proposed financing of&#13;
generating fuels from the point of view of Tbilsresi, the key project beneficiary. The cost flows of the&#13;
Gardabani project include the: (a) investment costs with contingencies (see Chapter II of this report), (b)&#13;
incremental operating and maintenance costs estimated in the feasibility study, and (c) taxes. We compared&#13;
these cash flows on the benefit side with the sales revenue Tbilsresi expects to receive -the net electricity&#13;
delivered to Sakenergo times the bulk tariff net of the 20% VAT. Gardabani generates a financial internal&#13;
rate of return (FRR) of 10.1% and a financial net present value (FNPV) of US$ 267 thousand at a 10%&#13;
discount rate (12.5% on nominal terms), with a payback time of about 20 years. The rehabilitation of&#13;
Gardabani is therefore justified based on a cost recovery basis and a 10 percent real interest rate.&#13;
5.3            A  sensitivity analysis&#13;
was undertaken to evaluate the impact      100%  ------- -------------- ----------------&#13;

5.4           Fuel purchases amount to US$15.85 million required to cover the generating fuel gap&#13;
envisioned for the 1996/97 and the 1997/98 winter seasons. The expected financial benefits of this&#13;
component include the sales revenue made possible at the expected bulk supply tariffs. The analysis shows&#13;
that sales revenue cover the fuel expenditures by a margin of 10 percent. The financial NPV of this&#13;
component amounts to US$1.3 million with an equivalent FRR of 16.1%. Detailed assumptions of the&#13;
financial analysis of both project components are presented in Annex 8.&#13;
C. Project Economic Evaluation&#13;
5.5           From the point of view of Georgia, the project is very attractive, with an economic rate of&#13;
return (ERR) of 30.8 percent (significantly higher than the 10.1 percent financial rate of return) for&#13;
Gardabani and 35.3 percent for fuel purchases. The distributional coefficient of the overall project (net&#13;
benefits to poor households as a proportion of the project net benefits) is positive, reaching 15 percent. The&#13;
fiscal coefficient (net fiscal revenue to the government as a proportion of net benefits) is about 53 percent.&#13;
The results are summarized below, and details shown in Annex 8.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Gardabani&#13;
5.6    The "without project" situation corresponds to the continued operation of the plant in its current&#13;
condition (i.e., without the 300-MW unit no. 10) and with the energy that the unit would supply provided&#13;
by imports until 2001 -the marginal source of electricity supply. The "with project" scenario corresponds&#13;
to the rehabilitation of the unit, restoring its parameters to their design values.&#13;
5.7           The costs and benefits of the project -measured as the increment over the "without project"&#13;
scenario- were discounted to the start of 1996. Costs include investment and incremental operational and&#13;
maintenance costs. There are two economic benefits, first the value of the incremental energy production&#13;
due to the project, and second the increase in consumer surplus -i.e., the avoided reduction in net user&#13;
benefits associated to a higher tariff "without the project."&#13;
5.8           "Without the project" the only feasible alternative would be to: (i) import electricity until&#13;
2001; and (ii) produce electricity from another domestic source of supply from 2002 onwards. Thus, the first&#13;
benefits are the savings from not having to use these alternative sources of supply as result of the project.&#13;
The second benefits arise from the fact that under a policy of cost recovery, electricity tariffs would be raised&#13;
to cover costs by 13.5 percent. Given a price elasticity of demand of -0.1, demand would decline by 1.2&#13;
percent "without the project." We have thus estimated the associated change in consumer surplus as a benefit&#13;
to the project.&#13;
5.9           The economic indicators of the project are very attractive, with an economic NPV of US$&#13;
47.9 million, and an ERR of 30.8 percent. The economic savings resulting from the project are the most&#13;
important benefits, and the production costs, the most significant expenditures.&#13;
5.10          The project appears robust against the risks and uncertainties that may impair its economic&#13;
performance. Figure 5.2 summarizes the results of the sensitivity analysis, while Annex 8 presents the&#13;
detailed results. The figure displays the changes (shown in the Y axis) in each of the cost and benefit streams&#13;
to yield a given ERR (the X axis). The point where the curves intersect along the X axis corresponds to the&#13;
30.8 percent ERR.&#13;

5.12   The economic analysis                  ~~~~Economic Rates of Return&#13;
of the proposed fuel purchases suggests&#13;
that significant economic net benefits          Figure 5.2: Economic Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
accrue to Georgia. If the generating&#13;
fuels were not made available, electricity supply would have to be rationed during the winter season and&#13;
reliability of supply would suffer considerably. Besides the social and reliability costs, consumers would&#13;
be willing to pay for electricity more than the actual tariff to avoid not being supplied. Based on this benefit&#13;
alone, financing of generating fuels has an economic NPV of 7.2 million and an ERR of 35.3 percent.&#13;
Distributional Impact&#13;
5.13           Table 5-1 presents the distribution of costs and benefits between the different project&#13;
stakeholders, specifically to the poor, and the government. The poor have two main benefits: employment&#13;
of unskilled labor during construction and operation of the project, and the increase in consumer surplus of&#13;
lower income households who would have had to pay a higher tariff without the project. Of the total net&#13;
project benefits, an estimated 15.1 percent go to the poor.&#13;
5.14           The government also benefits from the project from a variety of sources. First, it collects&#13;
a road tax of 0.1 percent of the production costs, and 20 percent VAT on bulk electricity sales. The analysis&#13;
shows that if they maintain a tariff policy of cost recovery, the government would benefit considerably from&#13;
the project, absorbing 52.7 percent through taxes of the total incremental net benefits made possible by the&#13;
project.&#13;

D. Project Risks&#13;
5.15          The recommendation to finance the proposed project at this stage recognizes the efforts of&#13;
state and sector authorities to begin to systematically address the main problems in the power sector.&#13;
Successful implementation of sector reforms, supported by this project, would create an environment in&#13;
which project direct benefits -- increase in electricity generation and improvement in the reliability and&#13;
quality of electricity supply -- would be sustained. Moreover, the reformed sector should be able to further&#13;
improve efficiency of the power svstem and support its expansion in the long run, increasing significantly&#13;
potential pay-offs of the project. However, project risks, particularly those related to the macroeconomic&#13;
environment and the sector's financial condition, are high. Through up-front measures (such as the tariff&#13;
increases, improved collections, and the debt restructuring exercise), and specific agreements, the project&#13;
is designed to improve accountability in the sector and mitigate project risks by monitoring compliance with&#13;
agreements and working with the authorities to take corrective actions where necessary. Several factors&#13;
which contribute to project risk, such as Government fiscal and social policies, the condition of the financial&#13;
sector, enforcement of hard budget constraints on enterprises, payment arrears and internal debts throughout&#13;
the economy, regulatory environment, and privatization strategy, have only been partially addressed by the&#13;
proposed operation and are being addressed by other Bank operations in the country, including a proposed&#13;
second Structural Adjustment Credit. Satisfactory compliance with agreements under this project will&#13;
influence future Bank operations in the sector.&#13;
5.16          The risks can be divided into two broad categories: (i) those associated with policies in the&#13;
energy sector, and (ii) the risks associated with the beneficiary and the project itself. The main risks&#13;
belonging to the first category are described in Table 5.2.&#13;
&#13;

obligations.                           commercialization and privatization of the power sector,&#13;
as outlined in the Letter of Sector Development Policy,&#13;
should reduce susceptibility of electricity suppliers to&#13;
[Moderate risk]                        political pressures. Still, however, some risk remains&#13;
that collections may not improve as expected. A&#13;
continued attention and close monitoring of collection&#13;
performance would be necessary to manage the risk.&#13;
2. Electricity tariffs are kept below cost   Tariffs weire increased before negotiations, and the future&#13;

risk.&#13;

enforcement of the commercial contracts is weak. The&#13;
situation (both with current collections and repayment of&#13;
old debt) needs to be monitored and addressed possibly&#13;
through other operations as well.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
GEORGIA&#13;
POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Statement of Power Sector Development Policy&#13;
The Government of Georgia (GoG) is undertaking a comprehensive reform of the Georgian&#13;
Electricity Supply Industry (GESI), to raise the efficiency, attract investment, and promote&#13;
commercialization and privatization of the industry. The reform proposals have the following key aims:&#13;
*     Promote -through competition and private sector participation- an economic and reliable supply&#13;
of electricity and the efficient use of electricity;&#13;
*     Ensure that sector enterprises have clear objectives, adequate autonomy and accountability for&#13;
their performance;&#13;
*     Mobilize adequate internal and external financial resources;&#13;
O     Minimize the environmental, health and safety impacts of electricity production and use at&#13;
acceptable cost; and&#13;
*     Strengthen markets and the private sector in Georgia.&#13;
The GoG considers the reforms in the power sector a fundamental component of Georgia's overall&#13;
economic restructuring. We present below the GoG's policies and objectives for the development of the&#13;
GESI and the actions (Attachment) the GoG is committed to take to reach the proposed objectives.&#13;
A. Macroeconomic Policies&#13;
The GoG, with the assistance and support of the IMF, the World Bank, and other multilateral&#13;
and bilateral agencies, initiated a far reaching transition process to a market-based economy. The GoG&#13;
is committed to continue along the challenging reform path to enforce financial discipline and commercial&#13;
behavior of state enterprises, and accelerate their privatization. Conditions are now propitious for greater&#13;
macroeconomic stability and more rapid structural change. We believe the GoG has taken important steps&#13;
in coping with the problems posed by the internal strife and the transition from a command to an open&#13;
market economy. We have achieved progress in opening-up international trade, deregulating prices,&#13;
achieving fiscal prudence, and improving the macroeconomic situation. These actions have resulted in&#13;
a decline in inflation, and progress toward a more realistic and liberal exchange rate. We are optimistic&#13;
about continuing along this path and firming the basis for regaining the conditions for the sustainable&#13;
growth of the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2                                  Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy&#13;
B. Electricity and the Economy&#13;
The GoG recognizes that the high intensity of electricity use, uneconomic pricing, poor&#13;
commercial practices, weak regulatory institutions, the supply inefficiencies and the overall&#13;
decapitalization of the GESI severely hinder the normal development of economic activities in Georgia.&#13;
The GoG has designed a new power sector policy and strategy that will support the program of economic&#13;
reforms. We believe there are feasible solutions for the steady improvement of the electricity situation&#13;
that will facilitate economic output growth and improve the living conditions of the population.&#13;
C. Guiding Principles of Sector and Enterprise Reform&#13;
The GoG is convinced that we will overcome the main issues and challenges facing the GESI&#13;
through sector reforms aimed at creating, on the one hand, a new legal and regulatory framework along&#13;
open market lines, and, on the other, separate commercial companies competing wherever possible among&#13;
themselves. We believe that this set of sector and corporate restructuring measures will enable us to&#13;
supply an economic and reliable supply of power to the greatest possible number of consumers in Georgia&#13;
in a sustainable manner. In summary, the following principles will guide the GoG reforms:&#13;
-     Achieve clear separation of the policy making, regulatory, and ownership functions of the State;&#13;
Promote optimal long term development of primary energy resources to attain an economic and&#13;
balanced development between the various types of resources (hydro, thermal, renewables) with&#13;
proper environmental consideration, and taking into account the regional context and trade&#13;
opportunities;&#13;
e     Ensure the interconnected system is operated at the minimum level of cost in accordance with&#13;
appropriate quality, reliability and environmental standards;&#13;
*     Unbundle the sector into separate generators, a transmission company and separate distributors,&#13;
allowing large users to choose suppliers, subject to the maintenance of the integrity of the system;&#13;
*     Ensure commercial independence and financial discipline of electricity industry enterprises,&#13;
holding them accountable for their performance;&#13;
*     Promote through competition (generation and sales) and incentive regulation (transmission and&#13;
distribution) an efficient and reliable electricity supply;&#13;
*     Open the sector to private investment, and transform existing electric utilities to strengthen fair&#13;
competition, open access to networks, improve efficiency, and attract fresh capital for its&#13;
development;&#13;
*     Remove barriers to entry to the GESI - regardless of ownership - and identify clearly rights and&#13;
obligation for remaining in it, including mechanisms to monitor and enforce coverage and quality&#13;
of service;&#13;
*     Promote market pricing of electricity, i.e., set the level and structure of electricity prices based&#13;
on economic principles to encourage efficient use of energy and capital while providing for&#13;
adequate mobilization of funds to cover the operating and expansion costs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy                                   Page 3&#13;
*      Establish explicit and targeted subsidies, for electricity supplied to very low income households;&#13;
*      Establish an independent electricity regulatory agency shielded from economic and political&#13;
influences by a) placing it outside the ministerial structure, b) providing it with an autonomous&#13;
budget, c) appointing long-term competent directors in a transparent manner, and d) staffing it&#13;
with professional and non-political personnel;&#13;
*      Establish clear and appropriate mechanisms to arbitrate and settle disputes among consumers,&#13;
producers, carriers, distributors and sellers of electricity; and&#13;
*      Ensure consistency with the Government's general policies of reform, economic stabilization and&#13;
adjustment.&#13;
D. Power Sector Policies&#13;
The GoG's power sector policy seeks to achieve sustainable efficiency in the GESI through the&#13;
application of the above set of principles. We established in 1996 the Ministry of Energy to guide the&#13;
GoG's energy policies in a consistent and coordinated manner.&#13;
Our strategy to achieve the efficiency objectives is based on: (i) corporatization,&#13;
commercialization and decentralization of the sector; (ii) implementation of commercial practices and&#13;
enforcement of payments; (iii) economic pricing of electricity with due regard to poor residential users;&#13;
(iv) establishment of a legal and regulatory framework to promote competition and private sector&#13;
participation; (v) optimization of the use of resources by fostering least cost development plans; (vi)&#13;
focusing investments in the short and medium term on the economic rehabilitation of existing facilities&#13;
and completion of economically viable but partially completed projects; (vii) promotion of efficient use&#13;
and conservation of electricity; and (viii) protection of the environment in electricity production and use.&#13;
We explain below each of these points.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4                                    Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy&#13;
(i) Sector Organization and Corporate Restructuring of the GESI&#13;
The GoG is undertaking a major reorganization of the sector, supported by a legal and regulatory&#13;
reform. We have started an extensive corporate reform of the sector enterprises. We intend to transform&#13;
their managerial and administrative practices to keep up with the legal and regulatory reform. The&#13;
intention is to transform the enterprises into efficient and commercial companies through decentralization,&#13;
the separation of functions and responsibilities, corporate restructuring, commercialization, modernization&#13;
of management processes, and privatization.&#13;
In 1996 we separated generation, transmission and distribution assets. This separation by&#13;
functions and corporate restructuring will instill transparency to the resource allocation process. It will&#13;
also allow us to improve management processes, organizational change and structural realignment, human&#13;
resource development and the implementation of management information systems. By June 1997, we&#13;
will form joint stock companies with separate management and accounts.&#13;
We are aware that the manner in which we brake-up and privatize the distribution companies&#13;
(Discos) are important for the sustainability of the proposed GESI.  Small Discos have limited&#13;
creditworthiness and may not attract strategic generating investors. The formation of the Discos needs&#13;
to ensure that each has a sound commercial market with an adequate mix of users. We will: (i) define&#13;
borders between distribution and transmission sectors according to the accepted technical standards; (ii)&#13;
reorganize distribution into a smaller number of companies with adequate customer base to be a viable&#13;
business entities; and (iii) begin a transparent process, with a competitive bidding for the distribution&#13;
franchises open to the private investors, to avoid selecting only the most profitable parts of the system,&#13;
and preventing that the unwanted distribution circuits with low income users are left to the public&#13;
sector.&#13;
(ii) Poor Collection and Inter-Enterprises Arrears&#13;
The GoG realizes the detrimental economic and social effects of nonpayment, poor collection&#13;
practices, and arrears between public sector entities. We are aware that poor commercial practices,&#13;
specifically inadequate billing and collection of bills, are the major obstacles for the financial viability&#13;
of the GESI. As part of the GESI reform measures, it is the intention of the GoG to ensure conditions&#13;
in which power supply enterprises can enforce collections, and are responsible for their financial&#13;
performance and the quality of service. We will mandate cutting service to nonpaying customers and we&#13;
will penalize the enterprises that fail to act accordingly.&#13;
Specifically, we will ask electricity supply companies to disconnect consumers in arrears,&#13;
including industrial consumers, households, and government budget-funded entities; impose reconnecting&#13;
fees, and penalties on unpaid bills not lower than the commercial bank lending rate; and we will establish&#13;
the system of deposits equivalent to three months of consumption for supplying persistent defaulters. The&#13;
central and the local governments will assume the responsibility for resolving payments on behalf of&#13;
essential public services in arrears. In addition, the distribution companies will take measures to improve&#13;
metering, billing, and collection, as well as measures to eliminate their payment arrears for the electricity&#13;
purchases from Sakenergo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy                                     Page 5&#13;
(iii) Electricity Pricing and Social Protection&#13;
As part of the economic liberalization program, the GoG initiated actions since September 1994&#13;
to move electricity prices gradually toward economic levels. We have made significant progress. We&#13;
have maintained a slower pace of adjustment for household electricity prices for social reasons.&#13;
However, we plan to raise the average residential rate to the industrial tariff level during the first half&#13;
of 1997. Simultaneously, we will subsidize low-income households for a minimum consumption of&#13;
electricity. We will examine and select by June 1997 the least distortionary manner in which to fund&#13;
these subsidies, either through the GoG's budget or through lifeline tariff rates.&#13;
We will eliminate cross-subsidies among consumer classes to reach full cost recovery tariffs for&#13;
each customer class by the end of 1998. Once we reach economic levels, we will continue to maintain&#13;
tariffs at these levels, through periodic adjustments as necessary given exchange rates and international&#13;
price changes. This will improve efficiency of electricity use and to ensure the financial viability of&#13;
electricity sector entities.&#13;
(iv) Reforming the Electricity Supply Industry Legal and Regulatory Framework&#13;
The GoG supports the establishment of a stable and transparent legal framework, clear regulatory&#13;
rules and independent regulatory institutions to ensure the achievement of the above objectives. To this&#13;
end, the GoG is committed to passing an electricity law that will:&#13;
-      separate the policy, regulatory and ownership functions of the Government, and&#13;
disengage the Government from business operations;&#13;
-      establish an independent electricity regulatory agency;&#13;
-      establish a firm  basis for commercialization of GESI, including liberalization of&#13;
international trade;&#13;
-      establish vertical separation of the electricity  supply  industry  into  generation,&#13;
transmission, and distribution functions;&#13;
-      allow private ownership of assets, including both the existing assets and new facilities;&#13;
-      open the way to competition in the production and distribution of power, and to its&#13;
transport under a "common carrier" transmission system;&#13;
-      create over the long-run conditions to encourage competition among the most economic&#13;
forms of electricity generation, including cogeneration by industrial plants, imports, and&#13;
other forms of generation and distribution, irrespective of ownership.&#13;
The GoG intends to create a stable and transparent regulatory framework by issuing detailed&#13;
regulations for the electricity supply industry and establishing an independent regulatory agency which&#13;
will implement the regulations. The agency will regulate tariffs; issue licenses; monitor and enforce&#13;
enterprises' responsibilities under the law; monitor financial viability of operators and their contractual&#13;
relationships; set and monitor quality of service; arbitrate disputes; and provide information and advice&#13;
to the Government. We will fund the agency in a way that ensures its independence and the hiring of&#13;
competent professionals.&#13;
(v) Sector Development Plans&#13;
As public resources to the sector have become critically scarce, special emphasis will be given&#13;
to the development of sound and consistent expansion plans based, first, on least cost principles and,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 6                                    Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy&#13;
later, on competitive investments. We wil develop a least-cost power sector investment program for the&#13;
medium and long term. This program will serve as an investment guide to existing public generators and,&#13;
once we privatize these, as an indicative least-cost expansion plan for prospective investors.&#13;
In the short term, we have established interim measures to ensure a correct allocation of scarce&#13;
resources. From information currently available, and considering the financial constraints, the following&#13;
investments have the highest priorities: a) rehabilitation of existing thermal and hydro power generating&#13;
plants, b) reinforcements to existing transmission systems, c) modernization of the electricity load&#13;
dispatch center, and d) rehabilitation of power distribution systems to reduce losses.&#13;
The GoG will actively promote regional cooperation in energy investment projects and&#13;
liberalization of energy trade.&#13;
(vi) Rehabilitation of Electric Facilities&#13;
The GoG assigns priority to urgently needed rehabilitation of generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution facilities that are severely deteriorated. Thermal and hydro generating plants are operating&#13;
at partial capacity levels and low efficiency. Additionally there exist serious transmission bottlenecks&#13;
while distribution networks need rehabilitation.&#13;
The restructuring and modernization strategy will give priority to reaching an adequate electricity&#13;
supply by rehabilitating and improving the efficiency of the existing installations through modernization&#13;
and repowering power plants and decommissioning - whenever economically justified - obsolete&#13;
installations.&#13;
(vii) Electricity Conservation&#13;
We are aware that measures to conserve energy are generally less expensive than investments to&#13;
expand supply. It is our firm intention to price electricity in a commercial manner, so that prices reflect&#13;
costs and induce consumers to use electricity efficiently. We will also examine alternative energy&#13;
conservation mechanisms and measures to complement economic pricing.&#13;
(viii) Enviromnent Protection&#13;
The GoG strongly believes that we cannot reach sustainable development without protecting the&#13;
environment. The GoG is developing an environmental strategy within the context of achieving&#13;
sustainable development. We intend to consider the environmental effects of electricity generation,&#13;
transmission, distribution and use. To this end, we will implement, considering the associated costs, the&#13;
measures stated in the strategy document to reduce the pollution impacts of electricity supply.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy                                 Page 7&#13;
E. Conclusion&#13;
We believe that the successful implementation of the reforms should be done through a transition&#13;
process designed to overcome the immediate problems mentioned, and to be the least disruptive for the&#13;
continuous supply of electricity. In summary, the immediate problems need the following measures: a)&#13;
improve collections; b) reach cost-recovery tariffs; c) introduce targeted subsidies for the very poor,&#13;
either from the national budget or through lifeline tariffs; d) reduce electricity losses; e) minimize&#13;
operational costs; f) complete separating the policy, ownership, and regulatory roles of the state; g)&#13;
improve corporate structure and management, commercial and administrative practices of the electricity&#13;
companies, and h) promote the privatization of the industry's assets in an open, transparent and&#13;
competitive manner.&#13;
The program outlined above will have a major impact on the country's macroeconomic prospects.&#13;
We expect it to provide a sound legal and regulatory framework to the GESI and improve the efficiency&#13;
of existing institutions while opening possibilities for attracting private investors. We appreciate the&#13;
support of the international community to this program. We look forward to a continued cooperative and&#13;
successful exchange which will help in placing Georgia on a path to stable and sustained economic&#13;
growth.&#13;

6.    At the initial stage to carry out reorganization of "SAKENERGO", and to establish 3 independent&#13;
subsectors - GENERATION &amp; TRANSMISSION, DISPATCH CENTER AND DISTRIBUTION&#13;
SUBSECTORS.&#13;
7.    Enterprises included in "SAKENERGO" s Generation Subsector (separate power plants or their&#13;
groups, maintenance or service enterprises or their groups) should be transformed into joint stock&#13;
companies, the shares of which will stay in the state property before the decision will be made on their&#13;
allocation. The Ministry of Fuel &amp; Energy should establish appropriate unit to regulate a State Share.&#13;
8.    "SAKENERGO"s Transmission &amp; Dispatch Structure should be transformed into united&#13;
commercialized, financially self-governing treasury enterprise "SAKENERGO", which will be supervised&#13;
by the Ministry of Fuel &amp; Energy and won't be the subject of privatization on the current stage.&#13;
9.    Distribution Structures will be completely separated from "SAKENERGO " according to territorial&#13;
principle and transformed into joint stock companies, the shares of which will stay in the state property&#13;
before the decision will be made on their allocation and they will be regulated by the Local Authorities.&#13;
The Ministry of State Property Management, together with the Ministry of Fuel &amp; Energy and Local&#13;
Authorities should draw up a privatization plan for this unit within one month.&#13;
10.   In order to carry out transformation of "SAKENERGO's Generation and Distribution enterprises&#13;
into joint stock companies the Department "SAKENERGO", according to the agreement with the Ministry&#13;
of Fuel &amp; Energy and Local Authorities should draw up a documentation according to the Georgian&#13;
Legislation about the "Owners" and "Privatization of State Enterprises" and until 1 August 1996 should&#13;
submit it to the Ministry of State Property Management, also "SAKENERGO" should draw up a&#13;
corporatization plan and submit it to the State Secretariat.&#13;
11.   Ministry of State Property Management of the Republic of Georgia until 1 September 1996 should&#13;
provide transformation of abovementioned enterprises into joint stock companies according to the&#13;
requirements of Georgian Legislation about the "Owners" and "Privatization of State Enterprises".&#13;
12.   The Ministry of Fuel &amp; Energy together with Local Authorities and the personnel of the&#13;
enterprises should draw up a plan on the transformation of accounting, financial and managerial activities&#13;
of the Separated Enterprises and Distribution Companies according to corresponding cost accounts the&#13;
implementation of which should start until 31 October 1996.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
ELECTRICITY DEMAND AND SUPPLY PROJECTIONS&#13;
1.     Electricity Demand. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the future economic evolution&#13;
of Georgia, which makes forecasting electricity demand a difficult exercise. The economy is in severe&#13;
disequilibrium, with major structural changes under way. Electricity tariffs as price signals have limited&#13;
impact on consumers' behavior because of poor payment enforcement, and effective tariffs' are far lower&#13;
than their nominal values. The pattern and the level of consumption, therefore, has been little affected by&#13;
tariff increases and income changes.  Overall, because of the poor state of electric installations,&#13;
consumption, in recent years, has been constrained by low supply availability. Furthermore, available&#13;
electricity supplies have sharply decreased because of lack of funds to import electricity and generating&#13;
fuels, and to properly maintain and operate the system. These funding shortages have also led to further&#13;
disrepair and accelerated deterioration of the production and delivery infrastructure.&#13;
2.     A dynamic consumption model2, which takes into account changes in GDP (gross domestic&#13;
product), price adjustments (including lagged effects), and supply constraints was used to forecast annual&#13;
demand for electricity for the period 1998-2005. Over the long-run, the way and speed of economic&#13;
growth determines largely how energy demand will be supplied and at what price. The model implicitly&#13;
assumes that the economy would stabilize sufficiently (structurally and behaviorally) by the beginning of&#13;
the period.&#13;
3.     Electricity consumption is an intermediate demand for other uses, such as light, motive power,&#13;
heat, etc. It is thus necessary to consider the customers' installed capacity to use each fuel (power,&#13;
gasoline, diesel, etc.). Since statistics on household appliances, industrial and commercial energy using&#13;
equipment are virtually nonexistent in Georgia, the chosen demand model is based on the "partial&#13;
adjustment specification," which introduces a proxy for the user's equipment stock. The model states that&#13;
demand in year t is explained by the value of all the explanatory variables in that year, plus the lag-&#13;
dependent variable (i.e., the energy consumed in the prior year).&#13;
4.     To express the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, a dynamic double-log&#13;
model was used. The key advantage of this model is that it provides estimates of both short- and long-run&#13;
elasticities. The estimated coefficients are the short-run elasticities that measure the proportional change&#13;
in the dependent variable due to the proportional changes in the independent variables. The long-run&#13;
elasticities are derived from the short-run elasticities using the estimate of the lagged effect in the estimated&#13;
equations; i.e.,&#13;
i    Defined as collected electricity sales revenues (as opposed to billings) over total electricity supplied (rather than billed).&#13;
2    The model was used for developing electricity demand forecast for the Energy Sector Review for Georgia (June 30,&#13;
1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Long Run Elasticity -  Short Run Elasticity&#13;
I -Estimate of Lagged Demand&#13;
5.      Given the absence of an adequate time-series on consumption and tariffs (the available data&#13;
extended from 1989 to 1995), the estimated electricity demand elasticities are essentially judgmental in&#13;
nature. Although regression analysis was performed, the quality of the estimates was so poor, given the&#13;
low number of observations and the deficient data quality, that we relied more on judgment than on the&#13;
regression results. We however examined our demand estimates against other demand studies elsewhere,&#13;
showing that they were within acceptable ranges.&#13;

Long-term elasticities                           0.72            -0.10&#13;
6.      Table 1 presents the values of the demand model used in the forecasts.  As expected, the&#13;
magnitudes of the elasticities are overall higher for income than for price. Although the estimated demand&#13;
is very inelastic to price changes in the short-run, the long-run price elasticity is significantly higher.&#13;

7.      Table 2 compares our elasticity estimates to four other demand studies.3 The comparison indicates&#13;
that electricity demand in Georgia is expected to be less elastic than other middle income countries in Latin&#13;
America. The tariff elasticity in Georgia is much lower than that of the other comparator countries. This&#13;
is partly explained by the poor payment track record of consumers in Georgia. The income elasticity in&#13;

Historical consumption data are presented in Table 3, and the demand forecasts in Table 4; the demand&#13;
forecast represents total domestic demand, including all network losses and self-consumption of generating&#13;
plants. The maximum annual load projections were derived from the energy demand projections and system&#13;
load factors, which were assumed to increase slightly from the present level of about 55 % to 65 % by 2005,&#13;
where they were in the years of unsuppressed demand4.&#13;

9.     As explained earlier, electricity demand is responsive to income growth. Given the economic&#13;
uncertainties, we examined two alternative scenarios. In the pessimistic scenario GDP grows at an average&#13;
of 4 percent per anum, while in the optimistic one, it grows by 10 percent annually. The results for the&#13;
three simulations are presented in the figure above. As one can see, once the supply shortages disappear&#13;
after 1997, demand starts growing in tandem with economic expectations, even under the pessimistic&#13;
scenario.&#13;
10.    Power Supply. The available capacity in the Georgian power system changes almost daily,&#13;
depending on the operational status of equipment, water level in hydro plants, and availability of gas or&#13;
mazut at the Gardabani thermal plant. It now ranges between 800 MW and 1400 MW, and is much lower&#13;
than the installed name-plate capacity. Energy production is also limited by the same factors. Historically,&#13;
Georgia covered about 50% of requirements in late 1980s-early 1990s from domestic hydro production.&#13;
The remaining 50% was supplied by domestic generation using imported fuel (about 30%) and by&#13;
electricity imports (about 20%). Since 1989 all three sources of electricity have declined. Hydro&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3: Electricity Demand and Supply Projections                                      Page 5&#13;
generation fell from more than 8 TWh in 1989 to 5.7 TWh in 1995. This drop cannot be explained only&#13;
by hydrological changes during the period. Similarly, thermal generation declined more than the quantity&#13;
of imported fuels, pointing to a decrease in plants' efficiency. Losses in the network, both technical and&#13;
commercial, also increased disproportionately (see Table 1.2 in main text). These facts indicate a&#13;
significant deterioration in system conditions and its technical production capacity -a result of maintenance&#13;
backlogs, disrepair, shortages of working capital and investment funds.&#13;
11.    System Expansion and Supply Costs. A simplified analysis of the supply options was conducted&#13;
to estimate investments needed to meet projected demand over the 1997-2005 horizon. System's operation&#13;
costs and investment requirements for generation were estimated assuming that, without investments in&#13;
system rehabilitation, the presently available production capacity -including hydro generation- would&#13;
continue to decline at a rate of about 5% per year, a conservative assumption given the higher rate of&#13;
decline of recent years. In balancing electricity supply with demand, economic dispatch of the Georgian&#13;
plants calls for scheduling hydro plants first, followed by the 300-MW Gardabani units. The rest of&#13;
demand in 1997 and 1998 has to be met by imports or by the older 150/165-MW units at the Gardabani&#13;
plant. A simple analysis demonstrates that importing gas or mazut for operating these units is more&#13;
expensive than importing electricity5. However, because of import constraints -isolation of the Georgian&#13;
system from the neighbors and the import of electricity in a radial configuration - which most likely will&#13;
be present throughout 1997-98, it was assumed that in these years the old Gardabani units will still be&#13;
operated.&#13;
12.    Without some investment to increase domestic generation capacity, the only option to satisfy the&#13;
forecasted demand would be to keep increasing electricity imports. Analysis in Annex 8, however,&#13;
indicates that rehabilitation ofthe 300-MW units at Gardabani is more attractive than imports, even without&#13;
taking into account investment costs needed to repair interconnection lines which would be necessary if&#13;
electricity imports were to be increased beyond several hundred megawatts.&#13;
13.    The analysis assumes a rehabilitation program for hydropower plants to reach their generation&#13;
potential of about 7.3 TWh by year 2003, from the present 5.7 TWh. The analysis also assumes that the&#13;
old 150/165-MW units at the Gardabani plant are retired after year 2000, and that both existing 300-MW&#13;
units are rehabilitated. No new ("green-field") capacity is needed until 200. Adding a new 300-MW unit&#13;
at Gardabani in 2002 (at a cost significantly lower than a truly "green-field" project, due to the fact that&#13;
some equipment has been procured and some civil work completed) enables the system to satisfy demand,&#13;
with increasing imports, until 2005. It is less obvious what expansion option is the least cost at the level&#13;
of system demand as projected for 2005 (see para. 1.26 in the main text). For the purpose of this exercise,&#13;
it was assumed that building a 450-MW combined cycle gas-fired plant would be the selected alternative.&#13;
14.    The analysis results in investment requirements for the generation system of about US$800 million&#13;
for the 1996-2005 period, of which about US$290 million would be used for rehabilitation of the existing&#13;
plants, mainly before year 2000, to recover about 1500 MW. The rest of US$510 million would be needed&#13;
after year 2000 for completion and construction of new plants, with total capacity of 750 MW.&#13;
5     At the net efficiency of about 20% and the current cost of natural gas at more than $65/tcm, only fuel cost of generation&#13;
comes to more than USC 3.5/kWh, while the price of electricity imports from Russia is USC 3-3.5/kWh.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
GEORGIA&#13;
POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
The Investment Program&#13;
A. Electric Power Infrastructure&#13;
1.      Georgia has extensive electric network coverage -  practically all households are connected to&#13;
the network. Its generation and transmission capacities were developed in the context of the FSU&#13;
economic and power system planning, and operated as a part of the integrated power system of the FSU.'&#13;
Both the fuel mix (share of hydropower, coal, oil, gas etc. in electricity generation) and the capacity mix&#13;
(size and type of generating units - base, intermediate, peaking) were optimized relative to the&#13;
Transcaucasus IPS and the FSU system, and are sub-optimal for the Georgia's power system taken alone.&#13;
2.      Generation. Total installed nameplate capacity of power plants in Georgia is about 5090 MW,&#13;
of which 2088 MW belongs to three thermal plants with 15 units (the Gardabani - 1850 MW, 10 units;&#13;
Tkvarcheli - 220 MW, 2 units; Tbilisi CHP - 18 MW, 3 units), 2843.5 is in 103 hydro plants with 182&#13;
units (of which 6 are large storage plants and 17 are larger run-of-river (RoR) plants; others are small&#13;
RoR plants), 5.4 MW are diesel units, and about 153 MW industrial plants ("block stations").&#13;
3.      The available capacity is, however, much lower. The Tkvarcheli thermal plant in Abkhazia was&#13;
damaged during the recent war and is out of operation. The Gardabani thermal plant, located near Tbilisi&#13;
and firing gas and oil, has 10 units altogether, two of which are newer 300-MW units commissioned in&#13;
1990 and 1994, respectively. Due to improper operation of these units (poor water treatment, lack of&#13;
lubricating oil, low and unstable system frequency, etc.), they suffered extensive damage for their age,&#13;
with particular damage to boilers, turbines and condensers. A fire that broke out in January 1995&#13;
damaged their control room and equipment. One of the units, no. 9, was rehabilitated in 1995 by&#13;
Sakenergo, using some major parts (e.g., turbine) which had been bought for the construction of another&#13;
300-MW block (no. 11). Its control room and equipment were repaired by Siemens AG, financed by&#13;
KfW under the German Energy Progerm. The other unit, no. 10, is not operational. Out of the eight&#13;
older 150-to-165-MW units, only two appear to be operational, or near-operational (two units are&#13;
undergoing major maintenance in preparation for comissioning) at a partial load of about 90-120 MW per&#13;
unit MW in total. These older units are very uneconomical, with efficiency below 20% (according to&#13;
the data for the first 5 months of 1994, the efficiency was only 17.2%). The Tbilisi CHP is in operational&#13;
I       Together with the power systems of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Georgian system constituted the Transcaucasian Interconnected&#13;
Power System (IPS) - one of the 11 IPSs in the FSU - controlled and dispatched from the Transcaucasian regional dispatch center in Tbilisi&#13;
(subordinated to the main system dispatch center in Moscow), to which the Georgian national dispatch center (also in Tbilisi) was subordinated.&#13;
In the regional context, Georgia had been developing hydro plants. Azerbaijan oil-based plants, and Armenia built a nuclear plant (in addition&#13;
to a mixture of gas-fired and hydropower plants). In all three countries, as in the FSU in general, investment policies in the last 15-20 years&#13;
favored use of natural gas in electricity generation. The Transcaucasus region, as a whole, was energy and electricity importer in the FSU,&#13;
although net direct electricity imports, unlike fuel imports, were not significant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2                                                          Annex 5: The Investment Program&#13;
condition, although it needs to be rehabilitated as no proper maintenance work has been done during the&#13;
last five years. The plant has been practically out of operation for the last several years due to the&#13;
shutdown of district heating system in Tbilisi which it serves with hot water. The industrial plants&#13;
("block stations") are also very old and inefficient; for example, the energy conversion efficiency of the&#13;
100-MW Rustavi industrial gas-fired generation plant is reportedly about 14%.&#13;
4.     The available capacity at hydro plants ranges between 400 MW  and 1000 MW, depending on&#13;
water availability and maintenance status. Maximum production of all hydro plants was 8,777 GWh in&#13;
1988, and average production between 1985 and 1993 was 7480 GWh; in 1994 it reached only 4900&#13;
GWh.&#13;
5.     Transmission Network. The power transmission network consists of 572 km of 500-kV lines,&#13;
21 km of 330-kV lines and 1565 km of 220-kV lines. The 500-kV line is the transmission backbone,&#13;
connecting the western part of the country, where most of hydro generation is concentrated including&#13;
Inguri, with the Gardabani plant in the eastern part. The line also connects Georgia, Russia and&#13;
Azerbaijan, and was meant to be the main regional transmission link. In addition, Georgia has another&#13;
220-kV link with Russia, a 220-kV link with Armenia, 1 10-kV with Turkey, and 220-kV and 330-kV&#13;
connections with Azerbaijan. The network of 220 kV and higher voltage has 18 substations; including&#13;
the 110-kV network (part of which has transmission role as well), the number of substations raises to&#13;
260. The transmission network suffers from the lack of regular maintenance and theft of the material,&#13;
and has very poor reliability2. Connections lines to Russia (500-kV) and Armenia are not functional at&#13;
the moment because of disrepair. A number of low-cost priority measures in substations, such as&#13;
replacement of circuit breakers, air-compressors, etc., have been implemented in 1995-96 under the&#13;
German Financial Cooperation, comissioned by KfW.&#13;
6.     Distribution Network.  The distribution network is extensive and consists of the following&#13;
sections: 4210 km of 100 kV, 3316 km of 35 kV, 2135 km of 10 kV, 2710 km of 6 kV and 76,740 km&#13;
of 0.4 kV. In addition to the problems characterizing the transmission network (lack of maintenance,&#13;
pilferage), distribution network was subject to more difficult operating regimes during the hours when&#13;
electricity was available as the only energy to households and, therefore experiencing surges in demand&#13;
frequently above the design capacity. The management of Telasi, distribution company supplying Tbilisi,&#13;
claims that they have to keep replacing or repairing transformers at a rate higher than in the years of&#13;
normal system operation.&#13;
7.     System Control and Conmmunications. The main national dispatch center (NDC) is located in&#13;
Tbilisi, and controls all major power plants and all 220-kV and higher voltage transmission facilities in&#13;
the country. It also controls 1 10-kV and lower voltage transmission facilities in eastern Georgia, while&#13;
the control center in Kutaisi controls 1 10-kV and lower voltage transmission facilities, as well as small&#13;
hydro plants, in western Georgia. The Kutaisi center also serves as a backup to the NDC in Tbilisi.&#13;
There are 17 regional dispatch centers in charge of distribution systems, which operate under the&#13;
supervision of the Tbilisi or the Kutaisi centers.&#13;
2      The transmission system experienced 114 incidents of line outages on 500-, 330- and 220-kV lines in the first 8 months&#13;
of 1995. It was reported that the line faults were a major cause of these outages, which often led to regional or country-wide&#13;
blackouts (27 country-wide blackouts were reported in the same period).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5: The Investment Program                                                                  Page 3&#13;
8.      The existing real-time data acquisition system is rudimentary, and includes - as designed - some&#13;
220 measurements and 900 telesignals from power plants and substations. No remote control is possible,&#13;
except for generation control of the Khrami-I power plant (manually, from main dispatch center in&#13;
Tbilisi), which is used for system frequency control. The Tbilisi dispatch center is linked directly with&#13;
main power plants, substations and regional network centers in the eastern part of the country, whereas&#13;
the connections with the facilities in the western part go through a regional center in Kutaisi. Although&#13;
34 substations and power plants are equipped with the FSU-made data acquisition equipment, NDC&#13;
currently receives real-time data from only three such field devices, due to near-complete breakdown of&#13;
the power line carrier-based data communication system, as well as faulty data communication equipment&#13;
and field instrumentation. Dispatchers at NDC have to rely on verbal phone conversations with the field&#13;
operators to monitor and control the system. However, this mode of communication is also unreliable&#13;
because of the poor telephone system, and dispatchers sometimes do not have even a phone connection&#13;
with some hydro plants for days.&#13;
9.      The power system in Georgia operates in permanent semi-emergency mode. Not only is it cut-off&#13;
from the neighboring systems3, but it often operates as several independent subsystems, with some power&#13;
plants supplying certain limited geographical areas. With demand consistently exceeding the available&#13;
supply, dispatchers are continuously struggling to maintain the electric balance by switching-off&#13;
consumers and rationing electricity. The generation/consumption balance is usually maintained at a&#13;
system frequency of less than the nominal 50 Hz, which enables supply to sa omewhat larger number of&#13;
customers, although with poorer quality and at the cost of accelerated deterioration of power system's&#13;
and users' equipment. With such poor control and communications, system frequency is also very&#13;
unstable, which has additional negative effects on equipment'.&#13;
B. Investment Priorities&#13;
10.    In the short-to-medium  terms general investment priorities are to restore the system  capacity&#13;
through enhanced maintenance, repair and rehabilitation. This would alleviate the electricity shortages&#13;
and create conditions to connect the system with neighboring electricity networks, enabling better&#13;
electricity trade and parallel operation, and improving the quality and reliability of service.&#13;
11.    Generation. Restoration of operational capacity at the existing plants through enhanced&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation has been identified as most important priority. Analysis of system&#13;
generation capacity and demand forecast leads to the conclusion that, most likely, no new generation&#13;
capacity is needed before year 2002. Based on Sakenergo's assessment and some preliminary system&#13;
3       Imports are effected in so-called "radial" regine where consumers, fed through an import line, are cut-off electrically&#13;
from the rest of the Georgian power system which, consequently, continues to operate in the "island" mode.&#13;
4       During the least two winters frequency was kept mostly at about 45 Hz. occasionally decreasing as low as 42 Hz.&#13;
After the rehabilitation of the unit 9 at Gardabani, the frequency is not allowed to go below 48.5 Hz (otherwise the unit would&#13;
trip). Because of unstable frequency, however, which continuously changes by several tenths of a Herz within several minutes&#13;
-an extremely undesirable and unstable regime - the newly rehabilitated 300-MW unit 9 at the Gardabani plant cannot exceed&#13;
generation of 180 MW.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

studies5, rehabilitation of 300-MW units at the Gardabani thermal power plant, and rehabilitation of&#13;
larger hydro plants -- the Inguri cascade, Ladjanuri, Khrami-II, Tkhibuli, Vartsikhe, Rioni, Gumati and&#13;
Jinvali -- should be given highest priority6. Rehabilitation of the Gardabani thermal power plant is&#13;
necessary as hydro production is not sufficient to cover demand, particularly during winter. It is a&#13;
project which, among the candidate projects, would achieve the highest contribution to the system&#13;
capacity and energy. Also, the transmission network regime requires injection of active and reactive&#13;
power at the Gardabani mode. A survey study, conducted by the SEED company under the EU-TACIS&#13;
financing in 1994 ("Development of an Energy Policy in Georgia - Rehabilitation and Extension of the&#13;
Hydroelectric System", July 1994), and the feasibility study for the program conducted by Hraza&#13;
Engineering, confirmed the urgency of rehabilitation of the hydro plants.&#13;
12.    Several options are available for system expansion in the medium-to-long term (after year 2001).&#13;
It seems likely that the large hydro potential of the country would play an important role. Construction&#13;
of some larger hydro projects has been initiated (e.g., the 700-MW Khudoni hydro project on the Inguri&#13;
river with annual generation of about 1800 GWh, and the 450-MW Namakhvani hydro project of three&#13;
cascade plants on the Rioni river with annual generation of about 1200 GWh), but potential for&#13;
developing small and medium-size hydro plants seem to be particularly good. Apparently, considerable&#13;
deposits of good-quality steam coal in the Tkhibuli-Shaori region could be used in a coal-burning power&#13;
station to reduce the dependance on imported fuels and diversify the fuel supply. Another candidate&#13;
option is completion of unit no. 11 at Gardabani, for which major civil works have been completed and&#13;
some equipment purchased. This, however, would have to be looked in the context of affordable fuel&#13;
purchases (mazut or gas), and the fact that some of the larger pieces of the purchased equipment have&#13;
been installed at units no. 9 and 10 to replace malfunctioning parts. Rehabilitation -- as alternative to the&#13;
retirement -- of some older units (no. 1 through 8) at Gardabani, particularly their possible conversion&#13;
to combined-cycle units, would need to be considered in the same context. Repair and rehabilitation of&#13;
the Tkvarcheli thermal plant in Abkhazia, with possible conversion to coal firing, should be considered&#13;
as well, once the political situation in the region stabilizes. Investments in reducing demand and&#13;
improving end-use efficiency should be compared with the supply-side alternatives. A least-cost power&#13;
development analysis (included as a technical service component in the World Bank project), supported&#13;
by more detailed examination of the competing options to determine their costs and benefits, should be&#13;
conducted to determine optimal investment program and system expansion plan.&#13;
13.    Transmission Network. A former-Sakenergo's business plan proposes the construction of a&#13;
second east-west 500-kV transmission line with a 220-kV line as a back-up and an inter-tie between the&#13;
two 500-kV lines. Such new lines would benefit the entire power system through the forthcoming period&#13;
of rehabilitation and the possible future construction of new plants. About two thirds of the new 500-kV&#13;
transmission line (out of a total of 420 km) have already been 60% completed and one 220-kV substation&#13;
(Moliti), associated with it, has come to a 20% completion. The total investment required for the entire&#13;
5      "Development of an Energy Policy in Georgia - Rehabilitation and Extension of the Hydroelectric System",&#13;
Kantor/SEEd Consortium, 1994; also, feasibility studies for the investment program by Burns and Roe, Harza Engineering,&#13;
American Electric Power (1996).&#13;
6      Rehabilitation of the Inguri plant should probably be first priority on technical grounds. Because of the political&#13;
problems in the region, however, the risk associated with launching a major rehabilitation project at this time would be very&#13;
high. Once the political situation in Abkhazia is stabilized and rehabilitation of the Inguri cascade becomes possible, hydro&#13;
plants which are downstream of the Inguri should also be rehabilitated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5: The Investment Program                                                      Page 5&#13;
line, however, is still considerable. Such an ambitious plan should be deferred until the economy shows&#13;
clear signs of recovery, and a new load size and pattern emerges.&#13;
14.   In the short term, there is a number of measures that can be implemented at relatively low cost&#13;
in order to improve quickly the reliability of the existing network.  Such measures include the&#13;
replacement of malfunctioning and obsolete but vital components, such as circuit-breakers and their parts,&#13;
air compressors for circuit-breakers, and accumulator batteries and their chargers. The pilferage of items&#13;
such as conductors, line insulators, and even transformer oil, has made these materials critical to the&#13;
smooth functioning of the network. In addition, two major components, related to connecting the&#13;
Gardabani thermal power station and an interconnection line with Azerbaijan, are needed to ensure the&#13;
reliability of power transmission from the two important sources.  Also, repairs and equipment&#13;
replacement at the connecting substations of several hydro plants and major 500-kV substations&#13;
(Zestafoni, Ksani) are among the first priorities, some of which have already been implemented through&#13;
KfW. These are followed by the need to establish reliable interconnections in order to synchronize the&#13;
system with neighboring countries, once a satisfactory operational performance has been attained.&#13;
Repairing the 500-kV connection to Russia, and the 220-kV line to Armenia (if Armenia will be able to&#13;
support parallel operation of the power systems) would serve this objective.&#13;
15.   Distribution Network. System overhauls and improvements are needed to reverse years of&#13;
maintenance neglect, pilferage, and security manipulations that have created a distribution system with&#13;
difficult operational conditions and unacceptable levels of safety and reliability. A major overhaul would&#13;
require large investments and must be deferred. An in-depth inventory would certainly discover that&#13;
replacement apparatus, windings, cores and oil for transformers, and other items could be of great benefit&#13;
in enhancing reliability and quality of service. The improvements will have to be implemented over time&#13;
and selectively, with first priority given to major load centers and improvements in metering and load&#13;
management capabilities. Ability to supply priority consumers independently will also be important in&#13;
enforcing payments and effecting electricity rationing, particularly in the short-term.&#13;
16.   System  Control and Communications.  The system is obsolete, in serious disrepair and&#13;
practically non-functional. Dispatchers cannot properly control configuration of the network, power flows&#13;
and generation because of lack of timely information. Although poor collection of payments and high&#13;
commercial losses are mainly the result of inadequate effort, organization and incentive system, an effort&#13;
to decrease the losses would significantly benefit from improved metering. Urgent measures are needed&#13;
to make it operational and restore at least basic communications with power plants and major substations&#13;
to ensure a minimal level of system integrity and reliability. In the medium-to-long term it would be&#13;
necessary to install modern communications, data acquisition and monitoring systems, and to upgrade&#13;
control and dispatch to a technical standard common in today's power systems.&#13;
17.   Investment Financing. The total investment needs for the generation system until year 2005&#13;
have been estimated at about US$800 million of which about US$300 million would be used for&#13;
rehabilitation of the existing plants (mainly until year 2002) to recover about 1500 MW, and the rest for&#13;
the construction or completion of new plants. Under the assumed demand projection scenario (Annex&#13;
3), new capacity will not be needed before year 2002. The needed rehabilitation works could be financed&#13;
initially, in large part, through borrowing from the international financing institutions. Multilateral and&#13;
bilateral financing agencies have committed or are considering allocation of about US$180 million for&#13;
the investment in the power sector in the 1995-1997 period. As the system restores its capacity and&#13;
financial health, and with general economic recovery, investments would have to be increasingly financed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

from internal resources and commercial borrowing. Since the financing needs will increase with new&#13;
programs becoming necessary, but also economically and financially viable, it will be necessary to attract&#13;
more capital from the private sector, both domestic and foreign. The conunercialization, corporatization,&#13;
and restructuring of the power industry, establishment of a modern legal and regulatory framework, and&#13;
privatization of sector enterprises which have already been initiated, should encourage private sector&#13;
investment, either directly, or through various independent power producer schemes, or through lending.&#13;
C. Components of an Investment Program&#13;
18.   An investment program in the power sector has been identified as a joint effort of the Government&#13;
of Georgia, the Georgian power industry, and various multilateral and bilateral financing agencies (World&#13;
Bank, KfW, EBRD, USAID, OECF of Japan, Government of Switzerland.). The program includes:&#13;
rehabilitation of: (i) a 300-MW unit (no. 9 and 10) at the Gardabani thermal plant, and the Gardabani&#13;
water treatment plant; (ii) six hydropower plants (Khrami II, Vartsikhe, Tkhibuli, Lajanuri, Rioni,&#13;
Inguri); (iii) system dispatch and control; (iv) communications; (v) several key transmission substations&#13;
and distribution networks, including electricity metering. The components of the investment program&#13;
which are still to be implemented, with a total cost estimated at about US$183 million, has been&#13;
segmented into a number of separate projects which are, or are planned to be, financed by the various&#13;
institutions, as presented in Table 1 below.&#13;
19.   The program includes the following components:&#13;
o      Rehabilitation of the Gardabani Thermal Power Plant (unit no. 10&#13;
o      Rehabilitation of Hydropower Plants&#13;
o      Rehabilitation and Upgrade of System Control&#13;
o      Rehabilitation and Upgrade of Communication System&#13;
o      Installation of Electricity Meters.&#13;
20.   Rehabilitation of the Gardabani Thermal Power Plant (unit no. 10). Unit No. 10 (300 MW)&#13;
although new (installed in 1994) is in a very poor condition. Inspection of the unit revealed that the unit&#13;
needs rehabilitation and replacement of major components to restore the unit to the original design and&#13;
improve its efficiency. The rehabilitation will include boiler heating surfaces, insulation, air heaters, flue&#13;
gas ducts, high and medium pressure rotors, turbine valves, feed water pumps, instrumentation and&#13;
control system, 6-kV switchgear, and generator circuit breakers and excitation system. It will also&#13;
include rehabilitation of water heaters, steam valves and piping, installation of new cables, and lighting.&#13;
The rehabilitation would restore the plant to its original design parameters and extend its life for another&#13;
15-20 years.&#13;
21.   Rehabilitation of Hydropower Plants. This component will include short-term and long-term&#13;
measures. The short-term measures will focus on priority rehabilitation of the following hydro plants&#13;
(nameplate capacities in parenthesis): (i) the Lajanuri hydropower plant (3x38.6 MW), (ii) the Khrami&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5: The Investment Program                                                      Page 7&#13;
II (2x55MW), (iii) the Tkhibuli (4x20 MW) and (iv) the Vartsikhe I, II, III and IV (4x2x23 MW). The&#13;
work involves the following measures:&#13;
o      Rehabilitation of turbine governors and wicket gates; replacement of turbine&#13;
blades; replacement, rehabilitation or upgrade of other related equipment&#13;
(motors, pumps, guide vanes, oil system etc.);&#13;
o      Rehabilitation of generators including replacement, rehabilitation or upgrade of&#13;
stator and rotor windings, generator circuit breakers, excitation, voltage&#13;
transformers and electrical protection;&#13;
o      Rehabilitation  of substations  and  related  equipment including  step-up&#13;
transformers, circuit breakers, isolators, earthing switches, protection relays and&#13;
current and voltage transformers;&#13;
o      Civil works including training walls, repair of gravity flow tunnels, slit out of the&#13;
reservoirs, repair of power canals and the construction -f the overflow spillways&#13;
at the Vartsikhe power plant.&#13;
22.   The rehabilitation is expected to increase the capacity for about 110 MW in total, and energy&#13;
generation during the next five years for about 2033 GWh in total. The increase is distributed across the&#13;
plants as follows: Lajanuri: 32MW and 403 GWh; Khrami II: 10 MW and 219 GWh; Tkhibuli: 35 MW&#13;
and 176 GWh; Vartsikhe: 33.5 MW and 1535 GWh. The rehabilitation will enable operation of the&#13;
plants for at least another five years with regular maintenance. After that, the plants will likely need a&#13;
more substantial rehabilitation to complement the measures proposed in this program. The long-term&#13;
measures will include more costly major overhauls of the plants which would restore their capacities the&#13;
design values or more, improve the efficiency, extend the lifetime, and enable a reliable operation of the&#13;
plants for another 15-25 years.&#13;
23.   The Inguri plant and water reservoir have been operating under difficult technical conditions&#13;
during the last several years. During the civil war, three of the five generator units failed due to poor&#13;
maintenance. Most of the dam monitoring and meteorological equipment were either damaged or lost.&#13;
The remaining equipment is in a very poor condition and does not allow Sakenergo to perform systematic&#13;
monitoring of the dam and it's behavior, which presents a high potential risk to a very large populated&#13;
area downstream of the reservoir. To allow Sakenergo to measure and monitor behavior of the dam and&#13;
control the risk, supply and installation of new monitoring equipment is urgently needed. The work&#13;
involves the supply and installation of geodetic and meteorological equipment, automatic reservoir level&#13;
recorders, manometers and chronometers for drainage water measurement, and provisions for emergency&#13;
power supply. Repair of four low-level outlets to stop water leakages (water losses are estimated at 8-12&#13;
m3/s at each gate), and provision of a stoplog, lost in an accident in November 1994, which would&#13;
enbale gate repairs, are also a priority.&#13;
24.   Rehabilitation and Upgrade of System Control. This component will address immediate needs&#13;
for improvements in system monitoring, control and dispatch by rehabilitating the Tbilisi and Kutaisi&#13;
dispatch centers and high priority field equipment. The work includes three major components:&#13;
o      installation of new computer-based, open-architecture master systems at the two centers;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 8                                                      Annex 5: The Investment Program&#13;
o      installation of new field monitoring and data acquisition equipment at selected power&#13;
plants and substations;&#13;
o     replacement of fault recorders at selected substations.&#13;
25.   Rehabilitation and Upgrade of Communication System. This component is intended to address&#13;
the urgent needs to restore voice and data communications, which are essential for the real-time control&#13;
and operation of the power system. The present communication system has serious limitations, including&#13;
poor quality channels and obsolete or non-functional equipment. The rehabilitation plan calls for the&#13;
repair or rehabilitation of the power line carrier-based comnmunications, with installation and intermixing&#13;
of new small microwave paths where heavier traffic requires higher capabilities. The plan will improve&#13;
communications between control centers and system facilities, as well as between regional dispatch&#13;
centers and transmission and distribution personnel. The program includes:&#13;
o     Restoration of primary paths of the power line carrier backbone communication system;&#13;
o      Upgrade and rehabilitation of the communication system in the Tbilisi area, which&#13;
connects the national dispatch center, the main thermal power plant (Gardabani), and&#13;
several important high-voltage transmission network substations (Gdani, Lisi, Navtlugi);&#13;
o      Development of a microwave communication link between the Kutaisi dispatch center and&#13;
Zestafoni 500/220/110 kV substation;&#13;
o      Upgrade of the short-wave long distance and local radio communication equipment;&#13;
o      Installation of telephone exchanges in the Tbilisi dispatch Center and at the Gardabani&#13;
plant.&#13;
26.   Installation of Electricity Meters. Metering is critical for commercial operation of Sakenergo&#13;
and distribution companies, and for reduction of any non-technical losses. This component would&#13;
represent only a pilot project, to provide installation of about 25,000 new electricity meters at different&#13;
consumer premises. Priority could be given to areas with high consumption and high distribution losses.&#13;
Meters may include both high-voltage meters which measure Sakenergo's deliveries to distribution&#13;
networks, and end-user meters in distribution networks. The latter will be leased by Sakenergo to&#13;
distribution companies running the network once selection of distribution systems to install the meters is&#13;
made. EBRD is pusuing the issue in more detail.&#13;
D. Cost Estimate and Financing&#13;
27.   Program Cost: Total program costs are estimated at about US$183 million equivalent. A&#13;
summary is presented in Table 1. The costs do not include technical assistance for procurement and&#13;
project management needed to implement the project.&#13;
28.   Program financing. The program would be partially financed by funds from a number of&#13;
multilateral and bilateral sources, including IDA, the German Financial Cooperation Fund via KfW, the&#13;
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Government of Switzerland, OECF,&#13;
and the Italian Trust Fund, as indicated in Table 1. There is a financing gap of about US$70 million to&#13;
implement the program completely.&#13;

29.    In addition to the project presented in Table 1, several projects have already been completed&#13;
or are under implementation. KfW has financed rehabilitation of unit 9 at the Gardabani thermal&#13;
plant, rehabilitation of transmission system, and some repairs at hydro plants, in the amount of about&#13;
US$70 million (excluding the contribution to the rehabilitation of unit 10 at Gardabani). EBRD&#13;
approved a loan of about US$18 million for rehabilitation of the Gardabani plant (water treatment&#13;
plant, condenser cleaning) and the Rioni hydro plant. USAID and EU have sizable technical&#13;
assistance programs, supporting both the investment projects and sector reforms.&#13;

GEORGIA&#13;
POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
Description of the Assessment&#13;
1.    The main environmental issue associated with rehabilitation of Unit 10 of the Gardabani Thermal&#13;
Power Plant is the potential impact on ambient air quality around the Plant. Rehabilitation will result in&#13;
a longer life for the unit and as a result, more fuel will be burned producing more atmospheric pollution.&#13;
The magnitude of the resulting impact will depend greatly on the amount of mazut burned and its quality,&#13;
particularly in regard to its sulfur content.&#13;
2.    The Gardabani thermal power plant is limited by the Ministry of Environment to a maximum size&#13;
of 2000 MW. The total name-plate capacity of the plant's ten units is 1850 MW; however, five of the&#13;
8 older 150-MW units (units no. 1-8) are out of comission, so that the total nominal capacity of the plant&#13;
after unit 10 has been rehabilitated will be 1050 MW -- well within the limits set by the Ministry of&#13;
Environment. The plant must also operate within specific emission limits (as part of its "ecological&#13;
passport") and is charged a "user fee" of approximately 12,000 lari per year for its gaseous emissions&#13;
within the "passport" limits. If the plant were to operate in excess of the permitted emission limits, it&#13;
would pay a penalty of up to 5 times this "user fee" for each episode.&#13;
3.    The Regional Environmental Inspectorate, as part of their environmental assessment, also&#13;
identified the following additional environmental impacts as resulting from operation of the Plant:&#13;
(i)    Thermal Pollution of the Kura River (cooling water can be 2-5 times the ambient water&#13;
temperature of the river, especially during the winter);&#13;
(ii)    Episodic leakage of mazut from the fuel transfer facility (rail transfer to the Plant&#13;
storage), and from underground storage tanks which can impact on surface and ground&#13;
water.&#13;
4.    IDA and the Government of Georgia both require that the project's potential for environmental&#13;
impact be determined, and that any management measures be included in project design to mitigate&#13;
environmental problems that may be identified. After discussion with the Ministry of Environment and&#13;
the local Environmental Inspectorate, IDA determined that both sets of requirements could be met through&#13;
an Ecological Expertise to be conducted by the Ministry of Environment. The terms of reference of this&#13;
Ecological Expertise were jointly prepared and agreed upon by IDA and the Ministry of Environment.&#13;
5.    The main focus of the ecological expertise was air quality, particularly in regard to ambient SOx&#13;
concentration. The impact of a rehabilitated unit 10 on ambient air quality was therefore estimated using&#13;
a computer model. Air quality modeling capability exists in Georgia and was used in 1992 to predict&#13;
Plant impact when up to 12 units were assumed to be in operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6: Environmental Impact Assessment                                            Page 2&#13;
6.    It was agreed that this earlier modeling work needed to be updated. Sakenergo and its consultants&#13;
provided the air quality modelers (the Hydrometeorology Department of the Ministry of Environment)&#13;
with the operational parameters of Unit 10 that are expected to result following the rehabilitation&#13;
(particularly as the rehabilitation affects SOx and NOx flue gas emission concentration, temperature of&#13;
the flue gas as it exits the stack, total emission volume, and duty cycle of the unit).&#13;
7.     The first job of the air quality modeling was to help determine a suitable standard for maximum&#13;
sulfur content of the fuel mix to be used by Unit 10, following rehabilitation. This was done by assuming&#13;
several different scenarios for fuel-quality/fuel-mix burned by the Plant as a whole. For this exercise to&#13;
be conducted, the following assumptions were made:&#13;
(i)    That the mix of gas and mazut and the sulfur content of mazut in the fuel-mix can vary&#13;
in proportion. The variable of interest is the total sulfur content of the total fuel mix&#13;
being burned;&#13;
(ii)    At least 3 scenario's were modeled. These were 0.5%, 1%, and 3% sulfur in the fuel&#13;
mix .&#13;
8.     After an estimate of the "allowable" maximum sulfur content of the fuel mix was preliminarily&#13;
determined, this part of the modeling results and the maximum fuel sulfur content recommended were&#13;
sent to IDA for review and comment.&#13;
9.     Modeling was then undertaken with the objective of predicting monthly ground level&#13;
concentrations of SOx and NOx using average ambient temperature of each month as the main variable.&#13;
This information needed to better define possible impact and to determine suitable sampling sites for a&#13;
long term monitoring program. The Ecological Expertise was completed in September 1996.&#13;
Results of the Enviromnental Assessment&#13;
10.   The results of the environmental assessment were as follows:&#13;
(i)    The post-project impacts on ambient air quality, as indicated by the atmospheric&#13;
dispersion modeling, suggested that few problems were likely to arise when fuel used in&#13;
Unit 10 included no more than 40% mazut, and that mazut contained no more than 3%&#13;
sulfur. However, Unit 10 is part of a larger power generation complex. Limiting sulfur&#13;
in mazut to no more than 1.5% would result in improvement in ambient air quality&#13;
around the Gardabani Plant, and would also minimize the gaseous sulfur contribution&#13;
from this Project to the earth's atmosphere;&#13;
(ii)    Thermal pollution of the Kura River is likely to be less of a problem after completion of&#13;
the rehabilitation. Unit 10 operates on a "closed water cycle". Steam is condensed and&#13;
recycled along with cooling water. It was estimated that only 2 m3/sec of make-up water&#13;
will be required to compensate for evaporative looses, and no water is discharged to the&#13;
environment. In comparison, the 8 smaller units require 40 m3/sec of water from the&#13;
Kura River when new and operating under full load (today, only 13 m3/sec is required&#13;
to be abstracted from the River, and a large part of this is returned to the environment).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 3                                              Annex 6: Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
(iii)   Episodic pollution of surface and ground waters with mazut spills does not seem to be&#13;
a major problem today. Spills occurred mainly from storage tanks that are no longer&#13;
used.&#13;
Enviromnental Monitoring&#13;
11.   It is necessary to undertake an ambient air quality monitoring program to ensure the effectiveness&#13;
of any management measures taken to mitigate environmental impacts, and to ensure that unforeseen&#13;
impacts do not jeopardize expected Project benefits. The location of sample sites are to be determined&#13;
with the assistance of the ambient air quality modeling (points where expected elevated SOx/NOx&#13;
concentrations are near human settlements or environmentally sensitive areas).  The Regional&#13;
Environmental Monitoring Center will also be consulted in regard to sample site selection and sampling&#13;
frequency.&#13;
12.   The Plant does not, at present, have the staff, equipment or training needed to undertake a long&#13;
term monitoring program. The project will include procurement of sampling equipment needed to at least&#13;
measure SOx and NOx, and to continuously monitor wind speed, direction and humidity under the terms&#13;
of the Credit from IDA.&#13;
13.   The monitoring program is to be developed with the assistance of a consultant procured under&#13;
a PHRD grant. The terms of reference for that consultant is presented below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Georgia: Gardabani Thermal Power Plant Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Terms of Reference- Consultant Assistance with Preparation of a Long Term Environmental&#13;
Monitoring Program&#13;
Project Environmental Assessment&#13;
1.    The main environmental issue associated with rehabilitation of Unit 10 of the Gardabani Thermal&#13;
Power Plant is the potential impact on ambient air quality around the Plant. Rehabilitation will result in&#13;
a longer life for the unit and as a result, more fuel will be burned producing more atmospheric pollution.&#13;
The main fuel of the plant is natural gas, with variable amounts of cofiring with mazut. The magnitude&#13;
of the resulting impact possibly associated with operation of the station following rehabilitation of Unit&#13;
10 depends greatly on the amount of mazut burned and its quality, particularly in regard to its sulfur&#13;
content.&#13;
2.    The Gardabani Thermal Power Plant is limited by the Ministry of Environment to a maximum&#13;
size of 2000 MW. It must also operate within specific emission limits (as part of its "ecological&#13;
passport") and is charged a "user fee" of approximately 12,000 lari per year for its gaseous emissions&#13;
within the "passport" limits. If the plant were to operate in excess of the permitted emission limits, it&#13;
would pay a penalty of up to 5 times this "user fee" for each episode. If units 9 and 10 were to both go&#13;
into operation, the Plant would probably need to demobilize at least 2 of its older units to stay within the&#13;
requirements of the "ecological passport".&#13;
3.    A brief environmental assessment has been done for the Project and reviewed by the Ministry&#13;
of Environment through its "Ecological Expertise" process. The main focus of the environmental&#13;
assessment was on emissions of SOx, NOx and total suspended particulates (TSP) from the rehabilitated&#13;
Gardabani Power Plant. Air quality modeling was therefore undertaken.&#13;
4.     The first objective of the modeling was to help determine a suitable standard for maximum sulfur&#13;
content of the fuel mix (gas and mazut) to be used by Unit 10 following rehabilitation. This was&#13;
accomplished by assuming several different scenarios for fuel-quality/fuel-mix being burned by the Plant&#13;
as a whole. Modeling was then undertaken to predict ground level concentrations of SOx and NOx. This&#13;
information was needed for the ecological expertise, and to determine possible sampling sites for a long&#13;
term monitoring program.&#13;
5.    The post-project impacts on ambient air quality, as indicated by the atmospheric dispersion&#13;
modeling, suggested that few problems were likely to arise when fuel used in Unit 10 included no more&#13;
than 40% mazut, and that mazut contained no more than 3% sulfur. Limiting sulfur to no more than&#13;
1.5% sulfur would result in improvement in ambient air quality around the Gardabani Plant, and would&#13;
also minimize the gaseous sulfur contribution from this project to the earth's atmosphere. The following&#13;
environmental management measures are therefore suggested:&#13;
(i)    Maximum amount of mazut to be burned in combination with natural gas in Unit 10&#13;
should be no more than 40% when;&#13;
(ii)    Maximum concentration of sulfur in the mazut does not exceed 1.5%;&#13;
&#13;

(iii)   Bringing Units 9 &amp; 10 back on-line will result in honoring the ecological passport limits&#13;
regarding maximum size of the Gardabani Plant.&#13;
Objectives of the Long Term Environmental Monitoring Program&#13;
6.    A long term, ambient air quality monitoring program around the Gardabani Power Plant will be&#13;
implemented under the immediate direction of Sakenergo's Environmental Department. It will have the&#13;
objectives of:&#13;
(i)    Determining whether the recommendations made to control the amount of sulfur in the&#13;
fuel mix being burned in Unit 10 (as a component of the total emissions from all units&#13;
of the Gardabani Power Plant) is being implemented as required under the terms of the&#13;
Project;&#13;
(ii)   Determining whether the recommendations made to control the amount of sulfur in the&#13;
fuel mix being burned in Unit 10 (as a component of the total emissions from all units&#13;
of the Gardabani Power Plant) prove to be adequate to maintain ambient air quality&#13;
within Government of George standards;&#13;
(iii)  Identifying any unexpected air quality impacts associated with operation of the Gardabani&#13;
Power Plant.&#13;
Proposed Scope of the Long Term Monitoring Program&#13;
7.    Approximately 8-10 permanent sampling sites should be identified by correlating information&#13;
from the atmospheric pollution dispersion modeling undertaken during Project environmental impact&#13;
assessment with topographical maps of suitable scale showing areas of human habitation and&#13;
environmentally sensitive areas. Sampling should be stratified to be representative of climatic conditions&#13;
experienced over the entire year. It should also be diurnal to cover all possible weather conditions&#13;
expected in the Gardabani region. The monitoring program will be funded under the Project and by&#13;
Sakenergo, and include:&#13;
-     A program to monitor ground-level concentration of TSP, SOx and NOx for at least 5&#13;
years after the commissioning date of the rehabilitated Unit 10, when the monitoring&#13;
program  should be reviewed.  This review  should lead to the transferring of&#13;
environmental monitoring responsibilities to the Gardabani Power Plant Staff;&#13;
-     Purchase of necessary monitoring equipment and training of environmental staff of&#13;
Sakenergo and the Gardabani Plant in the use of the equipment, and with the&#13;
implementation of the air quality monitoring program.&#13;
8.    The location of monitoring sites, conduct of the sampling program, and dissemination of&#13;
monitoring results should include the Regional Environmental Inspectorate and Regional Monitoring&#13;
Center of the Ministry of Environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Scope of the Proposed Consultancy&#13;
9.    Consultancy assistance is needed to advise the Environmental Department of Sakenergo on:&#13;
(i)    The development of a fully detailed, long term monitoring program (sample site location,&#13;
sampling frequency, analysis of results and dissemination of results, etc.);&#13;
(ii)    Assist with technical specifications for air quality and weather monitoring equipment to&#13;
be purchased under the proposed Project;&#13;
(iii)   Develop a training program (using mainly local sources of environmental expertise,&#13;
supplemented with internationally-sourced training as needed) for the Environmental&#13;
Departments of Sakenergo and the Gardabani Power Plant;&#13;
(iv)   Provide basic training to Gardabani Power Plant Environmental Staff in methodology&#13;
needed for weather station location, establishment, operation, and maintenance.&#13;
10.   The consultancy is expected to consist of a single, four week visit to Georgia, and one week in&#13;
the consultants home office to prepare for the visit and to write up a final report of the results of the&#13;
consultancy. The consultant selected will need to be an atmospheric physicist (or similar) familiar with&#13;
air quality modeling, monitoring and establishment of weather stations.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
GEORGIA&#13;
POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT&#13;
1.      We conducted a financial and economic analysis, based on the incremental costs and benefits&#13;
derived from the with/without project approach, on the two project components: (i) rehabilitation of&#13;
Gardabani, and (ii) the purchase of generating fuels. All costs and benefits were expressed in 1996 constant&#13;
prices. The economic flows are net of taxes, subsidies and depreciation. The 10% discount rate (12.5%&#13;
in nominal terms) used in the analysis corresponds to the opportunity cost of capital in Georgia.&#13;
2.      The "without project" scenario represents the continued operation of the plant in its current&#13;
condition, subject only to routine limited maintenance, and with continued deterioration of availability and&#13;
efficiency. The "with project" scenario represents rehabilitation and replacement of major components of&#13;
Unit No. 10 (300 MW), to restore it to its original design capacity and operational efficiency. Estimates&#13;
of average annual energy production for the two scenarios were deternined from the unit's characteristics&#13;
and operational parameters in each scenario.&#13;
A. Financial Evaluation&#13;
Gardabani Rehabilitation Component&#13;
3.      We discounted the costs and benefits of the "with project" scenario, measured as an increment over&#13;
the "without project" scenario, to 1996. The financial costs include investment and incremental operational&#13;
and maintenance costs (including a 0.11 % of indirect taxes and the allocation for depreciation), while the&#13;
financial benefits refer to the additional sales revenue made possible by the project. The project enables&#13;
an increment in generation due to: (i) restoration of the unit's capacity; (ii) improvement in plant&#13;
availability; and (iii) improvement in plant efficiency. The FNPV of the component is US$ 267 thousand&#13;
and the FRR is 10.1 percent. Table 8. 1 presents the summary results of the project's financial analysis.&#13;

4.       The sensitivity analysis examines maximum and minimum  changes in the cost and benefit streams&#13;
of the project and the resulting internal rates of return. The sensitivity shows that the project financial&#13;
profile is very sensitive to changes in the project parameters. Table 8.2 shows the assumed changes and&#13;
results of the financial sensitivity analysis.&#13;

B. Economic Evaluation&#13;
Gardabani Rehabilitation Component&#13;
6.       The economic costs include the investment and incremental production outlays net of taxes and&#13;
depreciation. The economic benefits are the value of the incremental energy production, and the increase&#13;
in consumer surplus -i.e., the avoided reduction in net user benefits associated to a higher tariff "without&#13;
the project." This arises from the fact that under cost recovery tariffs, tariffs would have to be raised in&#13;

average by 13.5 percent "without the project" to cover for the higher costs of supply costs. Given a price&#13;
elasticity of demand of -0.1, demand would decline by 1.2 percent without the project. We show the&#13;
summary economic analysis for Gardabani in Table 8.4. The ENPV of the component is US$ 48.0 million&#13;
and the ERR is 30.8 percent.&#13;

affect its economic performance. Table 8.5 presents the results of the economic sensitivity analysis. The&#13;
ERR would not drop below the 10 percent benchmark unless either investment costs increase by more than&#13;
1 1O percent, production costs increase above 20 percent, and savings decline below 15 percent. Consumer&#13;
surplus benefits are negligible.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The principal objectives of the Power
            Rehabilitation Project for Georgia are to: a) increase the
            operational capacity and electricity generation of the power
            system; b) stabilize electricity supply; b) establish
            Tbilsresi as a commercially independent and financially
            self-sufficient generation company; and c) improve the local
            capability and assist in project management, corporate
            management and commercialization and privatization of power
            enterprises. The project consists of the following
            components: a) rehabilitation of a 300 MW unit at the
            Gardabani thermal power plant; b) increase in working
            capital at Tbilsresi; and c) technical assistance to
            Tbilsresi for project management, corporate management and
            development of a privatization strategy for the company.
