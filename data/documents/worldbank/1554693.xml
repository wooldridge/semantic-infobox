FOREWORD&#13;
Centrally planned economies (CPEs) account for a significant share of&#13;
the world's production and income.    In view of their importance in the world&#13;
economy, and to facilitate international comparative analysis, for many years&#13;
the World Bank has included statistical data on these countries in those of&#13;
its publications that aim for universal coverage, such as The World Bank&#13;
Atlas.   Among these data, those relating to gross national product (GNP) and&#13;
to GNP per capita are the most important, and the Bank also needs them for&#13;
operational purposes for its member countries, which now include some CPEs.&#13;
In the CPEs prices are generally set administratively and are often&#13;
loosely or not at all related to the relative scarcity and costs of production&#13;
of goods and services.    This is particularly true of the exchange rate.    The&#13;
World Bank normally uses exchange rates for converting GNP figures from&#13;
national   currencies  into   dollars   (or  into  any   other  numeraire),   an&#13;
indispensable   step  for  international   comparisons.     The  choice   of  an&#13;
appropriate conversion factor therefore poses particularly difficult problems&#13;
for most CPEs.   A further difficulty arises because the national accounts of&#13;
the CPEs are based on the concept of net material product (NMP), which differs&#13;
from the concept of GNP used in market economies.     To derive the GNP numbers&#13;
of those CPEs that compile only NMP accounts, various adjustments must be&#13;
made.   The data required for making these adjustments are not always fully&#13;
available.   Finally, a separate set of issues arises in relation to year to&#13;
year comparisons within the same CPE.      For these too and the corresponding&#13;
growth rates, official data are not strictly comparable to growth rates of the&#13;
market economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In early 1982 a research project sponsored and financed by the World&#13;
Bank was undertaken to assess alternative methods of computing the per capita&#13;
dollar GNP levels and growth rates of CPEs.        It covered eight countries:&#13;
Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary,&#13;
Poland, Romania and the U.S.S.R.    The purpose of this research project was to&#13;
define the best among known methods that could be applied to CPEs as a group&#13;
and make use of available data.     It was not its aim to establish and define&#13;
new computation methods whose application would have required many more years&#13;
of effort, even if data had been available.&#13;
This research project has produced eleven reports, which are&#13;
published   simultaneously.    The  main   report  authored  by   the  principal&#13;
researcher for the project, Paul Marer, is published as a book, Dollar GNPs of&#13;
the USSR and Eastern Europe (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985). The eight&#13;
country studies and two background papers are published separately in the&#13;
World Bank Staff Working Paper series.        The main report provides highly&#13;
valuable insights into the problems related to the estimation and comparison&#13;
of the GNPs and GNP growth rates of the CPEs.   It also gives the author's best&#13;
estimates of the actual values of these indicators for the majority of CPEs&#13;
covered by the project, that is those for which there was some statistical&#13;
basis for computing estimates or choosing between those already available.&#13;
The main report on the Research Project on CPEs concludes that&#13;
adequate GNP data in national currencies can be derived for most CPEs by&#13;
adjusting official information about net material product in the light of&#13;
statistical and other information known to country experts.          It further&#13;
concludes that the best method generally applicable to CPEs for converting&#13;
such GNP data from local currencies into dollars would use conversion rates&#13;
based upon purchasing power parity (PPP) information.       For comparison with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
corresponding World Bank data on other World Bank members, these conversion&#13;
rates should be adjusted to correct for the expected differences between the&#13;
PPP rates and the actual official exchange rates (the "exchange rate deviation&#13;
index"). The needed adjustments are estimated econometrically from the actual&#13;
differences observed at each level of per capita GNP among the thirty-one&#13;
market economies participating in Phase III (1975) of the International&#13;
Comparison Project (ICP).    For Hungary, Romania, and Poland, PPP information&#13;
is derived from Phase III (1975) of the ICP, while for Czechoslovakia, the&#13;
German Democratic Republic, and the U.S.S.R., it is derived from private&#13;
bilateral comparisons chain-linked to the ICP data.       This method yields a&#13;
range of per capita GNP estimates: for example, $2,700 to $5,700 with a&#13;
midpoint of $4,190, for the U.S.S.R. in 1980.    No PPP estimate was available,&#13;
and no GNP per capita figure in US dollars calculated, for Bulgaria and Cuba.&#13;
The main report also concludes that the official estimates of growth&#13;
rates of the CPEs "tend to yield varying degrees of upward bias."        For all&#13;
countries except Hungary, the experts lean toward preferring alternative&#13;
indices, constructed by outside experts with partial information, although&#13;
these too present problems (especially for countries other than the U.S.S.R.)&#13;
and the experts therefore fell short of endorsing them.       The author of the&#13;
study on Hungary leans toward preferring the official index at this time.&#13;
The country studies and background papers that are being issued in&#13;
the World Bank Staff Working Paper series provide additional details on the&#13;
CPEs studied and their exchange rates.     Some of the country studies include&#13;
the respective authors' estimates of per capita GNP in U.S. dollars.       These&#13;
estimates, however, are the individual authors' experimental computations,&#13;
based on methods that may not be consistently applicable to CPEs generally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
There remain major uncertainties about GNP conversions by means of&#13;
"adjusted PPPs." In addition to numerous remaining theoretical and practical&#13;
problems associated with calculating PPPs within the framework of the&#13;
centrally coordinated ICP, private estimates such as those used in this study&#13;
for three CPEs still appear to be subject to a wide margin of error.&#13;
Furthermore, there is no other way to estimate the exchange rate deviation&#13;
index than to derive it from observation of the countries covered by the ICP&#13;
(almost all of which are market economies).      The applicability of an index&#13;
derived in this fashion to the CPEs, whose economic structures are very&#13;
different, remains subject to reservations.&#13;
The present study used ICP Phase III data relating to the year 1975,&#13;
extrapolated to 1980.    Phase IV ICP data already published shows estimates&#13;
directly relating to 1980 for European countries, including Hungary and&#13;
Poland; Romania, a participant in early phases of the ICP, has not provided&#13;
the data needed for participation in Phase IV. It is noteworthy that Phase IV&#13;
estimates of Hungary's and Poland's per capita GNP in 1980 are lower than the&#13;
1975 results extrapolated to 1980, used by the Research Report on CPEs. These&#13;
differences are partly due to the greater attention paid in Phase IV to&#13;
quality differences and to other methodological advances.&#13;
During the course of 1983 the Bank, with the help of a distinguished&#13;
panel of experts, 1/ undertook a review of the methodological problems and&#13;
issues related to the estimation of internationally comparable per capita GNP&#13;
figures for all countries. The preliminary results of the research project on&#13;
CPEs constituted an important input into that review, whose findings and&#13;
l/ Abram Bergson, Harvard University, Chairman; Andre Vanoli, Institut&#13;
National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques; and Parmeet Singh,&#13;
Commonwealth Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recommendations were approved by the panel of experts.         In light of the&#13;
review, the Bank has decided that for the time being (that is, at least until&#13;
data availability and other problems related to PPP information are resolved),&#13;
official GNP information converted at official exchange rates should generally&#13;
continue to provide the basis of the per capita GNP estimates published in The&#13;
World Bank Atlas.   Exceptions to this rule are to be made only when official&#13;
GNP data, in national currency, is exceptionally bad or compiled in ways which&#13;
diverge in an exceptionally large measure from the usual methods and&#13;
standards, or when the official exchange rate is exceptionally far removed&#13;
from the rate effectively governing foreign payments transactions. When there&#13;
is a reason to believe that such exceptional circumstances prevail, and&#13;
adequate information exists, appropriate adjustments are to be made.        When&#13;
adequate information does not exist and cannot be obtained, no estimates are&#13;
to be published.   At the time of writing this foreword, it seems likely that&#13;
lack of information will for some time prevent the Bank from making estimates&#13;
of the per capita GNP of most CPEs.     Thus The World Bank Atlas published in&#13;
early 1985 contains an estimate of the values of GNP and GNP per capita for&#13;
only one European CPE, Hungary.&#13;
Following the review endorsed by the panel of experts, the World Bank&#13;
has adopted calculation methods and obtained results which, for a few&#13;
countries, are different from those of the research project of CPEs.         The&#13;
Bank's general methodology must be applicable to all its member countries,&#13;
including most market economies and only a few CPEs; the Bank could demand&#13;
that its member countries provide additional information when needed; and it&#13;
could, and did, decide not to estimate the per capita GNP of countries for&#13;
which a minimal, but still fairly extensive set of information could not be&#13;
obtained.   As noted earlier, however, the research project on CPEs has aimed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
at defining a method consistently applicable to all CPEs and one that could&#13;
make use of available information.    These differences in aims and constraints&#13;
readily explain the differences in results.&#13;
The research project on CPEs, whose major findings are published in&#13;
the main report, has greatly enhanced the understanding of the CPEs' unique&#13;
macroeconomic accounting frameworks and pricing systems.        It has provided&#13;
insight into many substantive issues, in particular the relationship of&#13;
domestic and international prices.    The individual country reports, published&#13;
separately, shed much light on many important country-specific issues.       The&#13;
Bank will continue to build upon the valuable findings of the research project&#13;
on CPEs in its future efforts to understand these important components of the&#13;
global economy.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
The paper presents estimates of GDP, GNP, their components and&#13;
rates of growth which are based on published statistics, information&#13;
available in various published sources and some assumptions.    The&#13;
adjusted values of nonmaterial services are added to the values of&#13;
material production as they appear in statistical yearbooks to obtain&#13;
GDP at current prices.    Similarly, the estimated values of expenditure&#13;
on nonmaterial services are added to expenditures on consumption products,&#13;
investment in fixed capital and changes in inventories to obtain GNP at&#13;
current prices.   The ratios of Net Domestic Material Product/GDP and&#13;
Net National Material Product/GNP are found to be unstable.     Comments&#13;
on principles and methods of price formation, taxation, subsidization,&#13;
price distortions, the official and special rates of exchange that were&#13;
used during the 1970's, the purchasing power rates and conversion&#13;
coefficients are discussed.    The rates of growth for 1970-75, 1975-80 and&#13;
1970-80 are calculated for the GDP and GNP at constant prices estimates&#13;
for 1970, 1975 and 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Summary&#13;
The paper presents estimates of GDP, GNP, their component parts and&#13;
rates of growth which are based on published statistics and information&#13;
available in various published sources.    However, the estimates were&#13;
made without the benefit of discussions with the Polish Central&#13;
Statistical Office (Glowny Urzad Statystyczny, or GUS).    As explanations&#13;
as to how various statistics are derived by GUS are very scarce or non&#13;
existent, it was necessary to apply various assumptions which may not&#13;
be correct.   Moreover,views have been expressed recently in the Polish&#13;
economic press that the quality of published statistics is not always&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
The derivation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current prices&#13;
from Net Domestic Material Product (NDMP or "Produced National Income&#13;
in the terminology accepted by GUS) is presented first.    After a brief&#13;
discussion of the availability of published data, classification and some&#13;
inconsistencies encountered, the value of nonmaterial services at current&#13;
prices is estimated on the basis of data from various sources according&#13;
to three concepts: (1) Gross Value of Nonmaterial Services (GVN) which&#13;
corresponds to Gross Material Output (GMO) and includes similar duplications;&#13;
(2) Gross Value Added of Nonmaterial Services (GVAN) which corresponds to&#13;
Gross Material Product (GMP) as they both include depreciation; and&#13;
(3) Net Value of Nonmaterial Services (NVAN) which corresponds to Net&#13;
Material Product (NMP) as they both exclude depreciation.    A particularly&#13;
great difficulty was encountered in the calculation of depreciation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The adjusted NVAN values have been obtained by adding the imputed values&#13;
of rents for housing units occupied by owners or their relatives and&#13;
deducting the values of nonmaterial services used up in material&#13;
production.   However, it became necessary to present two alternative&#13;
estimates of the adjusted NVAN as a serious inconsistency was discovered&#13;
between figues published for different years.    Accordingly, two alternative&#13;
estimates of GDP are presented with a simple examination of the sensitivity&#13;
of the estimates to mistakes in the estimates of the values in the&#13;
nonmaterial sphere.   As it was impossible to verify the material&#13;
production statistics in this exercise, the value of GMO, GMP and NMP&#13;
have been accepted exactly as they appear in statistical yearbooks,&#13;
although some relevant comments have been added.&#13;
An important finding of the study is that the NDMP/GDP ratio is&#13;
unstable and that, therefore, the GDP values cannot be safely estimated&#13;
from NDMP by applying a ratio estimated from a single year or period.&#13;
This method is particularly unsatisfactory at the time when there is&#13;
rapid growth or decline in domestic material production because, as&#13;
it can be expected, nonmaterial services tend to be more stable than&#13;
material production.&#13;
The structure of NDMP, NDP, GDMP and GDP at current prices is&#13;
presented with a qualification concerning price distortions which&#13;
affect it to a different extent in difference years.&#13;
The derivation of Gross National Product (GNP) at current prices&#13;
from Net National Material Product (NNMP) or "Allocated National Income"&#13;
in the terminolofy used by GUS) is also preceded by a brief discussion of&#13;
the availability of published data, classification and inconsistencies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
encountered.   Consumption of nonmaterial services is derived from&#13;
various sources.   The values of investment in fixed capital and changes&#13;
in inventories have been accepted as published in statistical yearbooks.&#13;
Expenditures on consumption have been supplemented by expenditures on&#13;
nonmaterial services.    The estimates of social consumption ("consumption&#13;
by society as a whole") and depreciation seem to be the least reliable&#13;
components of GNP.   However, a simple sensitivity examination suggests&#13;
that the impact of mistakes in these two items on the estimated value of&#13;
GNP would not be very big.&#13;
The ratio of NNMP/GNP is also unstable and it is strongly affected&#13;
by economic fluctuations.    It increases during an upswing and declines&#13;
during a downswing.   The structure of NNMP and GNP is presented again&#13;
with a qualification that it is affected by price distortions.&#13;
The subsequent two sections contain comments on principles and&#13;
methods of price formation, taxation, subsidization, price distortions,&#13;
the official and special rates of exchange that were used during the&#13;
1970's, the purchasing power rates and conversion coefficients.    In&#13;
the last section estimates of GDP and GNP at constant prices are&#13;
presented and the rates of growth are calculated on the basis of the&#13;
official "constant 1977 prices" index and some assumptions as to the&#13;
choice of deflators for nonmaterial services and for depreciation.&#13;
The rates of growth for 1970-75, 1975-80 and 1970-80 have been calculated&#13;
from the GDP and GNP at constant prices estimates for 1970, 1975 and 1980.&#13;
For 1970-75 the rates of growth of GDP and GNP are lower than the corresponding&#13;
net material product rates.    For the whole 1970-80 period the GDP rate&#13;
of growth is lower than the NDMP rate, but the GNP rate exceeds that of&#13;
NMP because the former did not decline as far as the latter did in 1975-80.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
This paper, and the estimates of GDP, GNP and their component&#13;
parts, rates of growth, etc., have been prepared without the benefit&#13;
of discussions with the Polish Central Statistical Office (Gaowny&#13;
Urzad Statystyczny, or GUS).   It was, therefore, necessary to&#13;
depend entirely on published statistics.   As some relevant data are&#13;
widely scattered in various GUS publications or even specialized&#13;
journals, a considerable effort was required to trace some of them.&#13;
A very wide coverage of published sources has been achieved, but the&#13;
process was very time consuming in the absence of a guidance by&#13;
Polish specialists.&#13;
A few available CSO's estimates of GDP, GNP and the corresponding&#13;
net aggregates were carefully evaluated by comparing them with&#13;
independently calculated aggregates or by checking for consistency with&#13;
other published data.   In some cases explanations as to how a particular&#13;
aggregate is derived are very scanty or non existent and it was necessary&#13;
to use Eeveral trial and error approaches before it became possible to&#13;
construct it independently from its component parts found in different&#13;
statistical sources.&#13;
The estimates which are based on the published statistics can only&#13;
be as accurate as the figures they use as their raw material.    Recent&#13;
discussions among Polish economists, including some high ranking officials&#13;
at GUS, have revealed a considerable degree of dissatisfaction with the&#13;
collection and publication of statistics in their country.     The view&#13;
that the quality of officially published statistics is not always&#13;
satisfactory is corroborated by the experience of working with Polish&#13;
statistical yearbooks.   There are some inconsistencies, gaps, changes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
in definitions that are not properly described, discontinuations of&#13;
some statistics and unexplained revisions of previously published&#13;
figures.2&#13;
Moreover, because of the existence of important gaps, it was&#13;
necessary to make various assumptions.    Some of them are of a rather&#13;
doubtful validity but without making them it would not be possible to&#13;
close the gaps.   The estimates constructed on such assumptions cannot,&#13;
however, be regarded as fully reliable.    They can only be used as a basis&#13;
for the evaluation of estimates which may eventually be provided by the&#13;
Polish CSO. They may help to formulate the right questions that should&#13;
be addressed to the GUS as to the way in which particular statistics are&#13;
compiled and estimates are calculated.&#13;
In order to facilitate the formation of such questions every effort&#13;
was made to (1) carefully indicate all sources which were used in every&#13;
case; (2) point out discrepancies which were encountered in the&#13;
published statistics; and (3) explicitly state all assumptions which&#13;
had to be made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

I. DERIVATION OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT FROM&#13;
NET DOMESTIC MATERIAL PRODUCT&#13;
1.    Availability of Published Data&#13;
Since the establishment of the People's Republic of Poland at&#13;
the end of W.W. II Polish national income statistics have been&#13;
presented in accordance with the MPS concept.   However, already&#13;
in the second half of the 1950's and at the beginning of the 1960's&#13;
several Polish economists argued in favour of the inclusion of non-&#13;
material services in national income accounts, or in the input-&#13;
output tables for the national economy, and some methodological&#13;
problems were discussed.3   Attempts to provide more accurate&#13;
comparisons of the post-war income levels with the pre-war levels4&#13;
and to make per capital comparisons with countries using the SNA&#13;
method5 stimulated interest in the calculation of statistics on&#13;
non-material services in a form which would be suitable for their&#13;
inclusion in national income accounts.&#13;
An early estimate of the value of non-material services was&#13;
made for 1968.    It was subsequently assessed to be upward biased.&#13;
Moreover, it was prepared on the basis of the classification which&#13;
was used until the end of 1970.      It included as non-material&#13;
services some activities which have been classified as material&#13;
since January 1, 1971.   The value of this estimate is, therefore,&#13;
limited as it is not fully reliable and is not comparable with&#13;
estimates made in subsequent years.7&#13;
In 1972 the C.S.O. published an estimate of non-material&#13;
services for 1970 which was calculated on the basis of the 1971&#13;
classification.8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The estimate presents the value of non-material services in&#13;
current prices according to three concepts:&#13;
(1)   Gross Value of Non-material Services (GVN), which corresponds&#13;
to Gross Material Output (GMO) and includes similar&#13;
duplications;&#13;
(2)   Gross Value Added of Non-material Services (GVAN), which&#13;
corresponds to Gross Material Product (GMP) as they both&#13;
include Depreciation;&#13;
(3)   Net Value Added on Non-material Services (NVAN), which&#13;
corresponds to Net Material Product (NMP) as they both&#13;
exclude Depreciation.&#13;
The main difficulty was encountered in the field of Depreciation.&#13;
The estimate includes only that depreciation which was actually&#13;
calculated by the establishments supplying non-material services.&#13;
As, however, only a fraction of all such establishments actually&#13;
calculated depreciation, the aggregate value of depreciation in the&#13;
estimate is downward biased.9 For this reason, the C.S.0. imputed&#13;
the remaining part of depreciation outside material production. This&#13;
procedure resulted in an increase in the value of depreciation from&#13;
3.9 billion zloty to 28.9 billion zloty in current prices.    The&#13;
imputed value of depreciation includes 20.0 billion depreciation on&#13;
housing; 9.7 billion in the socialist and 10.3 billion in the non-&#13;
socialist sector.&#13;
The C.S.0. used the modified value of depreciation in its&#13;
estimate of GNP for 1970, calculated in accordance with the SNA&#13;
methodology, which was published in 1972.10 The addition of imputed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
depreciation increases GVAN from 90.9 billion to 116.6 billion zloty,&#13;
an increase of 28.3%.   The estimates of NVAN, GVAN AND GVN in billion&#13;
zloty at current prices are as follows:&#13;
Original       Modified&#13;
Labour costs                                64.3            64.3&#13;
Accumulation                                22.7            22.7&#13;
Net Value Added                             87.0            87.0&#13;
Depreciation                                  3.9          29.6&#13;
Gross Value-Added                           90.9          116.6&#13;
Material costs of non-material services      64.1           64.1&#13;
Non-material services purchased from&#13;
other establishments                        7.4            7.4&#13;
Gross value                                162.4          188.1&#13;
We shall see that for a number of reasons not only depreciation&#13;
calculated in connection with non-material services,but also that in&#13;
material production is very unreliable.   It seems, therefore, that&#13;
as a rule the estimates of Net Material Product and Net Value Added of&#13;
Non-material Services, and therefore also Net Domestic Product which&#13;
is their sum, are more reliable when they are calculated from labour&#13;
costs and accumulation  than the corresponding gross estimates (GMP,&#13;
GVAN and GDP) if the latter are obtained from the former by adding&#13;
depreciation.   On the other hand, the reverse is true if the net&#13;
estimates are calculated starting with Gross Material Output and Gross&#13;
Value of Non-material Services, and therefore, also Gross Output&#13;
which is their sum, by first deducting the material and non-material&#13;
costs and then deducting depreciation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
In an article published in 1973 a leading Polish specialist in&#13;
the field of national income statistics uses the value of depreciation&#13;
in the non-material sphere which differs from the two previously&#13;
given figures, namely 22.0 billion zloty.    There is, however, also&#13;
another discrepancy of fundamental significance.    In the article the&#13;
value  added   of non-material services is 99.2 billion zloty from&#13;
which 16.1 billion is deducted as the value of non-material services&#13;
used up in material production.    The difference is 83.1 billion.&#13;
It is not clear whether the previously presented estimates of NVAN&#13;
include or exclude the value of non-material services used up in&#13;
material production.   However, neither 83.1 billion nor 99.2 billion&#13;
are equal to the figure given in the original and in the modified&#13;
version (87.0 billion).&#13;
In 1977 the C.S.O. published for the first time statistics on&#13;
non-material services in a yearbook of national income.12    The estimates&#13;
of GVN, GVAN and NVAN are presented for 1970 and 1975.    Unfortunately,&#13;
they differ from the previous versions.    The value of depreciation&#13;
(3.2 billion) is even lower than in the original 1972 estimate which&#13;
does not include imputed depreciation for those fields of non-productive&#13;
services where depreciation is not actually calculated.    Also GVN,&#13;
which is given as 165.7 billion, differs from both the original (162.4 billion)&#13;
and the modified 1972 version (188.1 billion).&#13;
In 1981 for the first time the overall statistical yearbook13&#13;
includes:&#13;
(1) an Input-Output Table for the National Economy, calculated&#13;
according to the SNA methodology, for 1977 - previously&#13;
published tables represented material production only;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
(2)   GVN and NVAN, but not GVAN and no Depreciation, for 1975,&#13;
1978 and 1979;&#13;
(3)   NDP (NMP + NVAN) for 1975, 1978 and 1979.&#13;
Unfortunately, the estimates for 1975 published in The Statistical&#13;
Yearbook 1981 differ from those published in The Yearbook of National&#13;
Income 1977.    GVN in 1975 is given as 291.5 billion according to&#13;
the 1977 publication and 307.3 billion according to the 1981 publication.&#13;
The differences is 15.8 billion, or 5.4% above the earlier estimate.&#13;
NVAN in 1975 is given as 166.9 billion according to the 1977 publication&#13;
and 172.2 billion according to the 1981 publication, a difference of&#13;
5.3 billion or 3.2%.&#13;
A normal procedure would, of course, be to accept the most&#13;
recent estimates available for every year.   However, it seems that&#13;
both the 1977 and 1981 estimates do not include the imputed value of&#13;
depreciation in those establishments which do not actually calculate&#13;
depreciation.&#13;
In order to evaluate the available statistics on non-material&#13;
services and the C.S.O. estimates of GDP or NDP it is first necessary&#13;
to examine the classification used by the Polish C.S.O.&#13;
2.    Classification Used by the Polish Central Statistical Office&#13;
Classification into material production and non-material services&#13;
is reflected in the division of the national economy into: (1) the&#13;
sphere of material production; and (2) the sphere outside material&#13;
production (also referred to as the sphere of non-productive services).&#13;
The material production sphere is composed of the following sectors of&#13;
the economy: (1) industry; (2) construction; (3) agriculture;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
(4) forestry; (5) transport and communication (including passenger&#13;
transport and communication serving households); (6) trade;&#13;
(7) other branches of material production (this sector includes,&#13;
among others, the material production of the "communal economy',&#13;
i.e. public utilities, city transport, etc. while the non-material&#13;
services of the "communal economy" are included together with housing&#13;
in the non-material sphere).l1&#13;
It should, therefore, be noted that Polish statistics on Gross&#13;
Material Output (GMO) and Net Domestic Material Product (NDMP or the&#13;
"Produced National Income") include in section 5 services which in&#13;
some other Centrally Planned Economies (CPEs) are classified as non-&#13;
productive and are, therefore, excluded from statistics on material&#13;
product.&#13;
The non-material services sphere is divided into two groups&#13;
of activities; (1) services satisfying the needs of specific users&#13;
(mainly private consumers); and (2) services satisfying the needs&#13;
of the society as a whole. The first group is composed of the&#13;
following sectors of the economy: (1) housing; (2) education;&#13;
(3) culture; (4) health and social welfare; (5) physical education,&#13;
sports,tourism; (6) other services (including barber and hairdressing,&#13;
cosmetical, photographic, undertaking establishments and non-material&#13;
communal services such as fire brigade, sanitation, cemetries, etc.)&#13;
The second group is composed of establishments which belong to the&#13;
following sectors: (1) scientific institutes; (2) public administration;&#13;
(3) police and national defence; (4) finance; (5) social and political&#13;
organizations; and (6) religious organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
The allocation of establishments between the two groups is on&#13;
the basis of their main activities.    In both groups services are&#13;
provided either at a price (full or subsidized) paid by the user or free&#13;
of charge.&#13;
Classification into material production and non-material services,&#13;
and the relative size of the two spheres and of their subdivisions, can&#13;
be examined by comparing the income-output table for the national economy&#13;
for 1977 calculated in accordance with the SNA methodology, which was&#13;
published in the statistical yearbook for 1981, with the income-output&#13;
table for the same year calculated for material production, which was&#13;
published in the statistical yearbook for 1980.15    The comparison of&#13;
the summarized tables is presented in Table I.1.&#13;
The tables do not explicitly give GrMP and GDP. NDMP is calculated&#13;
by subtracting Material Costs and Depreciation from GMO ("Global&#13;
Material Production") and NDP by subtacting Material and Non-material&#13;
Costs and Depreciation from GO ("Global Material Production and Non-&#13;
Material Services")&#13;
GDP produced in the material sphere is lower than GIMPPby the&#13;
amount of non-material services used up in material production.&#13;
In the case of non-material services for the whole society&#13;
(science, technology, public administration, justice, finance and&#13;
religious services) no material and non-material costs have been&#13;
provided. Although the value of depreciation in:this group of&#13;
non.material services i4 given, it is not clear whether it represents&#13;
only the actually calculated depreciation or includes also the imputed&#13;
depreciation for those establishments in which it is not actually&#13;
calculated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
3.    The Value of Non-material Services&#13;
In order to illustrate differences between various estimates in&#13;
the value of non-material services made by the Polish G.S.O. the 1972&#13;
and 1977 estimates for 1970 are compared in Table I.2 and the 1977 and&#13;
1981 estimates for 1975 are compared in Table I.3.    In the case of 1970&#13;
the two estimates differ as to the value of GVN and Material and Non-&#13;
material Costs.   The 1972 estimate is presented with imputed depreciation&#13;
as well as in its original version (the latter figures are in brackets).&#13;
The 1977 estimate includes only depreciation actually calculated.    The&#13;
figures differ, however, from those included in the original 1972&#13;
estimate.   In the case of 1975 the two estimates differ in respect&#13;
of GVN and NVAN (the only two values given in the 1981 estimate).&#13;
The 1977 estimate includes again only depreciation actually calculated.&#13;
The 1981 estimates include:: only depreciation actually calculated in all&#13;
sectors, except housing where an imputed depreciation is provided for&#13;
houses belonging to the socialist sector and no depreciation is imputed&#13;
for private housing.&#13;
Table I.4 presents the CSO's estimates for 1970, 1975, 1978&#13;
and 1979. As the 1977 estimates for 1970 and 1975 seem to be in-&#13;
consistent with other estimates, they have been omitted.    The table&#13;
also presents the value of non-material services purchased by the population (P)&#13;
and the net current payments from the state budget to various sectors which&#13;
produce non-material services (B).    These are expenditures and their&#13;
value may, of course, be affected by the balance of trade of goods and&#13;
services. On the whole, trade in invisibles does not, however, play&#13;
an important role in Poland and the discrepancy between the produced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
and available services should not be big.&#13;
The purchases by the population and the budget allocations&#13;
have been included in the table in order to provide a rough test&#13;
of consistency for the value of GVN and GVAN which should be related&#13;
to them.   The ratio P+B to GVN has been changing over time with a&#13;
tendency to rise.&#13;
The values of GVN and NVAN for 1980 are not available at present&#13;
as they have not been included in the Statistical Yearbook 1981.&#13;
They have, therefore, been estimated.   As of the two variables P and B,&#13;
P seems to be better correlated with the values of GVN and NVAN, the&#13;
1979 ratio of P/GVN has been used to estimate the 1980 GVN values and&#13;
the 1979 ratio P/NVAN to estimate the 1980 NVAN values.   The assumption&#13;
on which the estimates are based is not necessarily correct and the&#13;
actual figures, when they are made available in the future, may prove&#13;
to differ from the estimated values quite considerably.&#13;
The estimation of depreciation in the non-material sphere creates&#13;
a problem.   The Statistical Yearbook 1981 gives the values of GVN and&#13;
NVAN for 1975, 1978 and 1979, but no depreciation.   As it is stated&#13;
in the yearbook, the value of NVAN has been obtained by deducting the&#13;
value of material and non-material costs and depreciation from the&#13;
value of GVN.   The value of depreciation in housing for every year can&#13;
be obtained from the Gross National Material Product (GNMP) Statistics.&#13;
The value of depreciation for other sectors of the non-material sphere&#13;
had to be imputed (seeTable I.5).   The following procedure was used.&#13;
The input-output table for 1977 contains depreciation in the non-material&#13;
sphere.   It is not, however, clear whether this is the actually&#13;
calculated depreciation only or the value also includes the imputed&#13;
&#13;

depreciation for those sectors and establishments that do not&#13;
calculate depreciation.   The estimates of depreciation for 1970, 1975,&#13;
1978, 1979 and 1980 have been calculated using (1) the 1977 sectoral&#13;
rates of depreciation for various sectors, and (2) the gross value of&#13;
capital stock for these sectors in each year. 6   This procedure&#13;
assumes not only that the rates of depreciation were the same in all&#13;
these years (actually there was a major revision in 1974), but also&#13;
that the composition of capital stock (particularly the ratio of&#13;
buildings to machines and equipment for which there is a big difference&#13;
in the rates of depreciation) remained unchanged within each sector.&#13;
When the value of depreciation is calculated in this way for 1970&#13;
and 1975, it differs from the two 1972 estimates as well as from the&#13;
1977 estimates.   It is probably downward biased as the rates of&#13;
depreciation in Poland have often been criticized as being excessively&#13;
low.17&#13;
According to the explanation provided in the Statistical Yearbook&#13;
1981, the value of housing services includes subsidies from the state&#13;
budget and the cost of the supply of water and central heating in the&#13;
case of apartment houses. 8    It is not clear whether rents actually&#13;
paid in the private sector are included.    The yearbook of national&#13;
income for 1977 states that the value of housing services includes&#13;
"rents in the state cooperative and private houses and workers'&#13;
hostels".19   It can be assumed that the value of housing services&#13;
does not include imputed rents in the case of private homes used by&#13;
their owners.&#13;
The 1978 census provides the following information on private&#13;
housing and the number of households living in housing units which&#13;
they own20:&#13;

Almost half of all housing units are privately owned representing&#13;
57.6% of the total living area of housing units.   The number of&#13;
households exceeds the number of housing units and 48.4% of households&#13;
live in the housing units which they own or which are owned by a&#13;
relative.   It can be assumed that the imputed rents should represent&#13;
48.4% of all rents.   Assuming also that 48.4% of living area is used&#13;
by owners or their relatives, this is the proportion of total rental&#13;
value of existing living area which has to be imputed.    There is rent&#13;
control in Poland and the minimum rent of 3.0 zloty and the maximum of&#13;
3.40 zloty per m2 per month was unchanged between 1970 and 1980.&#13;
Table I.6 presents the imputed rental value of the living area&#13;
used by owners or relatives which has been calculated on the basis of&#13;
2&#13;
the above assumptions, taking 3.40 zloty per m as the opportunity&#13;
cost of private use of the housing unit (assuming that the alternative&#13;
is indeed available - a rather unrealistic assumption).&#13;

14.   Estimates of GDP at Current Prices&#13;
As it is impossible to verify the material production statistics&#13;
in this exercise, the value of Gross Material Output, Material Costs,&#13;
Gross Material Product, Depreciation in Material Production and Net&#13;
Material Product have been accepted exactly as they appear in&#13;
statistical yearbooks.   The qualifications mentioned in the&#13;
Introduction have to be kept in mind when the GDP value is estimated&#13;
on the basis of official statistics.   GMO includes various duplications&#13;
and both GMO and Material Costs are sensitive to organizational changes&#13;
in the economy that affect the degree of vertical integration and there&#13;
are indications that such changes were made in the past to affect&#13;
statistical results.21&#13;
The ratios of both GMP and NMP to GMO is not very stable.    They&#13;
were growing from 1970 through 1972 and declining from one year to&#13;
another between 1972 and 1980 (see Table I.7).    The spread between the&#13;
highest and the lowest value of both ratios represents 3.7 percent point.&#13;
The value of depreciation in material production depends not only on&#13;
the method used to calculate depreciation and the real size and&#13;
composition of the capital stock in the material production sphere, but&#13;
also on the relative prices of capital goods which are usually kept&#13;
unchanged for a certain period of time and then abruptly revised across&#13;
the board. A major modification of the method of the depreciation&#13;
calculation, which took place as from January 1, 1974, reduced the&#13;
ratio of depreciation to GMP in that year and, by transferring the&#13;
expenditure on certain types of repairs from depreciation to current&#13;
costs, increased material costs.    It has been calculated, for example&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
that the application of the new methods to the 1972 figures would&#13;
change them by the following percentage changes:&#13;
Material costs                 + 1.87%&#13;
GMP                            -  3.24%&#13;
Depreciation                   -17.14%&#13;
NMP                            - 2.12%&#13;
The ratio of depreciation to GMP usually tends to increase when&#13;
the prices at which the capital stock is calculated are revised upward.&#13;
This happened during the late 1950's and during the 1960ts22 and, again,&#13;
in 1975 and in 1977-1978.   On the whole the ratio of depreciation to GMP&#13;
tends to fluctuate more widely than the ratio of depreciation to Gross&#13;
Fixed Capital Stock (2.31 and 0.64 percent point respectively - see&#13;
Table I.7).&#13;
Estimates of GDP at current prices for six:years (1970, 1975,&#13;
1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980) are presented in Table I.8.   Only two&#13;
estimates of GDP by the CSO calculated from NDMP have been available&#13;
to the author of this paper: (1) an estimate for 1977 which is based&#13;
on the published input-output table 23; and (2) an estimate which is&#13;
based on the summary of an unpublished input-output table for 1978.24&#13;
All other estimates represent own calculations which have been based on&#13;
more or less incomplete data and some assumptions which can be incorrect.&#13;
The value of NMP and depreciation in material production have been&#13;
taken from the most recent statistical yearbooks.   The unadjusted NVAN&#13;
for 1975, 1978 and 1979 are the CSO's estimates published in Statistical&#13;
Yearbook 1981.    The value for 1977 has been taken from the input-output&#13;
table as published in the same yearbook (see Table I.1) and it is identical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
to that used in CSO's estimate of GDP for that year.    The value for&#13;
1970 is taken from the CSO 1972 estimate (see Table I.2).    Although it&#13;
was adjusted for the changes in the definition introduced in 1971, it&#13;
likely will not be very reliable.   A new method of the depreciation&#13;
calculation was introduced in 1974 and another reclassification of the&#13;
national economy took place as from January 1, 1976, which affected the&#13;
calculation of net product in various sectors of the economy. 25   It is&#13;
possible that this figure is not completely comparable with those for&#13;
1975, 1977,.1978 and 1979.   The least satisfactory is, however, the&#13;
estimated value for 1980.   It is based on the assumption that in that&#13;
year there was the same ratio of non-material services purchased by the&#13;
population to NVAN as in 1979 (see Table I.4).    As the ratio is not&#13;
stable from one year to another, this assumption is not, therefore,&#13;
very dependable.&#13;
The adjusted NVAN values have been obtained by adding the imputed&#13;
values of rents for housing units occupied by owners or their relatives&#13;
(see Table I.6) and deducting the values of non-material services used&#13;
up in material production.   The latter have been calculated in two&#13;
alternatives as there is a serious inconsistency between the figures&#13;
published for 1975, 1978 and 1979 in Statistical Yearbook 1981 and&#13;
the figure available from the input-output table for 1977, published&#13;
in the same yearbook.&#13;
Alternative "A" accepts for 1970 the value from the CSO 1972&#13;
estimate.   The values for 1975, 1978 and 1979 are the CSO estimates as&#13;
published in Statistical Yearbook 1981.    They do not seem to be&#13;
inconsistent with the value for 1970.    The value for 1977 has been&#13;
calculated as the same ratio to NMP as in 1978 and the value for 1980&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
as the same ratio to NMP as in 1979.   As the ratios are different in&#13;
different years, this assumption is again not very well founded, but it&#13;
has to be made for the lack of actual data.&#13;
Alternative "B" accepts the value of non-material services used up&#13;
in material production in 1977 as presented in the input-output table&#13;
for that year and it assumes the same ratio of this value to NMP in all&#13;
other years.   The values calculated in this way are considerably higher&#13;
than in the case of Alternative "A": 163% in 1970; 201% in 1975; 89% in&#13;
1977; 137% in 1978; 140% in 1979 and in 1980.     The inconsistency&#13;
between the CSO estimates for 1975, 1978 and 1979 on one hand, which were&#13;
used as the basis for Alternative "A", and the CSO estimate for 1977,&#13;
which served as the basis for Alterative "B", cannot be explained.&#13;
As Alternative "A" has the CSO estimates for three years and is not&#13;
inconsistent with the CSO estimate for 1970, it can, perhaps, be&#13;
accepted as more plausible of the two.&#13;
The values of depreciation in the non-material sphere have been&#13;
estimated accepting:  (1) for housing - the fi-gures reported in the GNMP&#13;
statistics in the most recent statistical yearbooks; and (2) for other&#13;
sectors of the non-material sphere - own calculations on the assumption that the&#13;
same sectoral depreciatfon rates-can be applied as those calculated for 1977&#13;
(see Table I.5).   This is, again, a rather weak assumption.   The value&#13;
of depreciation for 1970 has also been calculated in the same way.   The&#13;
unmodified figure from the CS0 1972 estimate seems to be too low&#13;
(3.9 billion) and the modified figure too high (29.6 billion).&#13;
In order to visualize the difference which would be made in the&#13;
GDP estimates by accepting the sectoral rates of depreciation&#13;
calculated for 1970 on the basis of the CSO 1972 modified estimate,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
Table I.9 presents the values of depreciation for all years calculated&#13;
in this way.&#13;
The estimate of GDP (Alternative A) is the sum of NMP, NVAN&#13;
adjusted in accordance with the alternative "A" calculation of non-material&#13;
production.   The estimate of GDP (Alternative B) differs from the&#13;
previous one by a differently calculated value of non-material services&#13;
used up in material production.   CSO's estimate of GDP for 1977 is&#13;
lower than the two alternative estimates, which include imputed rents.,&#13;
but it is not much lower than the Alternative B.    CSO's estimate&#13;
for 1978 is, however, higher than both alternative estimates.    The&#13;
estimate of GDP (Alternative A) seems to be more plausible of the two&#13;
alternative estimates and, perhaps, more than the CSO estimates for&#13;
1977 and 1978.   Unforutnately, the estimates for 1970 and for 1980&#13;
are the least reliable.&#13;
The two alternative estimates of GDP are based on certain&#13;
assumptions aDncerning the non-material sphere for which no sufficient&#13;
information is available.   In order to examine the extent to which the&#13;
estimates are sensitive to possible miscalculation, Table I.10 illustrates&#13;
the impact of a 10% increase in the value of: (1) unadjusted NVAN:&#13;
(2) imputed rents for housing units occupied by owners or their&#13;
relatives; (3) non-material services used up in material production;&#13;
and (4) depreciation in the non-material sphere.    Because the&#13;
aggregate value of non-material services is considerably smaller than&#13;
the value of material production, none of these changes have a big&#13;
impact on the estimated value of GDP.    The sensitivity of the estimate&#13;
of GDP for 1970 is the lowest and that for 1980 the highest.    However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
even in 1980 if the actual value of the unadjusted NVAN were 10%&#13;
above the value on which the two estimates of GDP were based, neither&#13;
,would be affected by more than 1.2%.   The impact of a 10% increase in&#13;
each of the other three components would represent only a small fraction&#13;
of one percent.   Even a larger mistake in the estimation of the values&#13;
in the non-material sphere would not make a big difference in the estimated&#13;
value of GDP.&#13;
5.    The Net Domestic Material Product to Gross Domestic Product .Ratio&#13;
As can be seen in Table I.8 the NDMP/GDP ratio is not very stable.&#13;
Even the two CSO estimates based on the input-output tables for 1977 and&#13;
1978 differ by 2.5 percent point.   The two alternative estimates show&#13;
differences in the ratio equal to 4.40 percent point.    However, in&#13;
both cases the differences in the ratio when the 1970 value is compared&#13;
with the 1980 value are considerably smaller:    0.37 percent point in&#13;
the case of Alternative A and 0.32 percent point for Alternative B.&#13;
The ratio was increasing between 1970 and 1977 during the big&#13;
investment drive of the first half of the 1970's and a few subsequent years&#13;
when the planners found it difficult to reduce the rate of investment.&#13;
At that time material production was growing considerably more rapidly&#13;
than non-material services.   The ratio was decreasing between 1977 and&#13;
1980 when the rate of growth of the real value of GDMP declined&#13;
drastically and became negative in 1979 and 1980.26&#13;
It appears that the GDP cannot be estimated safely by applying&#13;
a fixed NDMP/GDP ratio.    This method is particularly unsuitable at&#13;
the time when there is rapid growth or decline in the real value of&#13;
domestic material production because, as it can be expected, non-&#13;
material services tend to be more stable than material production.&#13;
&#13;

6.    Structure of Net Domestic Material Product and Gross Domestic&#13;
Product According to Origin.&#13;
The structure of NDMP, NDP, GDMP and GDP is presented in Table I.11.&#13;
Non-material services have been adjusted in accordance with Alternative A&#13;
and the estimate of GDP (Alt. A) has only been included.    It seems that&#13;
the structure is not very stable when calculated at current prices.    The&#13;
share of industry fluctuated: (1) by 6.7 percent point within the range&#13;
52.8% and 59.5% in the case of NDMP; (2) by 6.3 percent point between&#13;
46.6% and 42.9% in the case of NDP; (3) by 5.3 percent point between&#13;
52.2% and 58.5% in the case of GDMP; and (4) by 5.2 percent point&#13;
between 46.7% and 51.9% in the case of GDP.&#13;
The structure is, of course, affected by changes in the degree of&#13;
price distortions.   In order to demonstrate the impact of changes in&#13;
price distortions but not the size of those distortions themselves,&#13;
Table I.12 presents the structure of NDMP at constant 1971 prices.&#13;
Although at constant prices the share of industry increased by 7.1&#13;
percent point between 1970 and 1980, i.e. the range was greater than&#13;
for NDMP at current prices, only in one year (1978) was this growth&#13;
interrupted and the. biggest share was in 1980. At current prices&#13;
the share increased from 1970 to 1975.    It declined in 1977 and, again,&#13;
in 1978, remained almost unchanged in 1979 and increased in 1980.&#13;
The biggest share appeared in 1975.&#13;

II. DERIVATION OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT FROM NET&#13;
NATIONAL MATERIAL PRODUCT&#13;
1.    Availability of Published Data&#13;
Some of the estimates of the Polish GNP in dollars, which were&#13;
made during the 1970's, also have information on GNP at current&#13;
prices in NCUs and its division according to final use. 7    For the&#13;
first time "the final use of material goods and non-material services"&#13;
was published by CSO in The Yearbook of National Income 1976.28&#13;
The Statistical Yearbook 1981 contains: (1) the estimates of net&#13;
values of goods and services for 1975, 1978 and 1979; and (2) the&#13;
final use of goods and services in the input-output table for 1977. 29&#13;
Data on the value of "non-material services sold to the population"&#13;
have been available in the annual overall statistical yearbooks since&#13;
1971 and in three specialized publications which appeared in 1974, 1976 and&#13;
1981.30   Statistics on "the consumption of goods and non-material&#13;
services" appeared in the annual overall statistical yearbooks during&#13;
the 1960's.   They became more comprehensive and better organized at&#13;
the beginning of the 1970's.&#13;
The final use of GNP, calculated from the input-output table&#13;
for 1977, is presented in Table II.1.   It is compared with other CSO&#13;
estimates of GNP in Table II.2.   The 1970 and 1975(A) estimates are&#13;
from The Yearbook of National Income 1976 and the 1975(B), 1978 and 1979&#13;
estimates are from The Statistical Yearbook 1981.    As the discrepancy&#13;
between the two estimates for 1975 demonstrates,the two sets of estimates&#13;
are not fully consistent.   The earlier estimates are lower in comparison&#13;
with those published in 1981, including the input-output table for 1977.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
2.    Classification Used by the Polish Central Statistical Office&#13;
In CSO's estimates of NNMP and NNP consumption is divided into three&#13;
parts: (1) consumption of goods and services purchased from personal&#13;
incomes; (2) consumption of goods and services financed from the so&#13;
called "social funds"; and (3) consumption of goods and services by&#13;
the society as a whole.   The first group includes the actual expenditures&#13;
at full or subsidized retail prices (actually paid by the consumers) on&#13;
the purchase of goods and services from the socialist economy, including&#13;
various government institutions; purchases at the market places at&#13;
prices actually paid there; and purchases from the private trade,&#13;
handicraft, transport and professional service establishments or&#13;
individuals.   Own consumption of agricultural produce and wood by&#13;
owners and their families in private agriculture is included.    It is&#13;
calculated at the official state purchase price (up to 1971 at the price&#13;
for deliveries in excess of the obligatory quota, i.e. at higher prices&#13;
than the special low prices which were fixed for obligatory deliveries).&#13;
The official prices usually do not, however, represent the real&#13;
opportunity cost to the private farmer as the prices in private trade&#13;
are often above the official purchase pL4tce.   The 1981 NNP statistics&#13;
and one of two sets of statistics on "non-material services consumed by&#13;
the population seem to include the imputed rents in private housing.3&#13;
In another set only actually paid rents are included.3&#13;
Consumption from the social funds represents the value of goods&#13;
and services received by the population free of charge and subsidies from&#13;
the state budget on the purchases of goods and services at the subsidized&#13;
prices.   Included in this group are services in education;   culture&#13;
(including art); health and social welfare; physical education, sport,&#13;
tourism and vacation resort facilities, subsidies on pharmaceutical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
products received free of charge or at nominal payment rates, on&#13;
housing and non-material services of the local authorities (the so called&#13;
"communal economy") and services performed by social organizations.&#13;
The value of free or subsidized services is calculated at the cost of&#13;
the establishments performing services,reduced by any payments changed&#13;
to the consumers.&#13;
Consumption by the whole society is composed of the cost of&#13;
public administration, law and order (justice), national defence,&#13;
finance, science and technology, social and political organizations,&#13;
including religious services, and those general expenditures on the&#13;
national economy which have no direct recipients.&#13;
One special feature of the social accounting practice should be&#13;
noted.33   Depreciation in private housing is imputed and included,&#13;
among material services in "the consumption of material goods from&#13;
personal incomes" in the estimates of Net National Material Product.&#13;
However, in the estimates of Gross National Material Product this&#13;
depreciation is excluded from consumption and included in depreciation&#13;
of fixed "non-productive" capital stock.   In CSO's estimates of NNP it&#13;
is excluded from consumption of material goods but it is not clear&#13;
whether it is included in non-material services, probably not.   In&#13;
order to avoid confusion this item has been separated from other&#13;
depreciation in Table II.5.&#13;
There is also some ambiguity concerning depreciation in "the&#13;
establishments outside the material sphere", which apparently is included&#13;
in "other consumption of material goods in the NNMP estimates.34   It is&#13;
not, however, clear (1) whether only actually calculated depreciation&#13;
is included or the imputed deprecietion a .welk; tZf whether, it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
transferred from consumption to depreciation in the GNMP estimates or&#13;
not; and (3) where it is included in the NNP estimates.&#13;
"Non-material services consumed by the population'include&#13;
some financial services: the handling costs of loans but not&#13;
interest payments, insurance and public lotteries only as an excess of&#13;
expenditures over receipts.   Purchases from travel grants are not&#13;
included in both material and non-material services.&#13;
3.   CConsumption of Non-material Services&#13;
Statistics on the consumption of material goods (commodities and&#13;
material services) and non-material services for 1970, 1975, 1977, 1978,&#13;
1979 and 1980 are presented in Table II.3.    These statistics have been&#13;
used by CSO to calculate consumption from personal incomes and consumption&#13;
from social funds in the NNP estimates for 1975, 1978 and 1979.    The&#13;
figures for 1970 and 1980 will, therefore, be used to make the NNP&#13;
estimates for these twc years.&#13;
It is more difficult to find satisfactory statistics on "consumption&#13;
by society as a whole".    The NNMP statistics include material social&#13;
consumption. The state budget expenditures (central and local budgets&#13;
together) on public administration, Justice, defence, science and&#13;
miscellaneous expenditures represent considerably smaller amounts than&#13;
"material social consumption" in 1970, 1975, 1977 and 1978 but exceeds&#13;
the latter in 1979 and 1980 (see Table II.4). The available estimates&#13;
of NP contain statistics on social consumption of material goods and&#13;
non-material services. They seem, however, inconsistent with social&#13;
consumption recorded in the NNMP estimates. In two years (1970 and&#13;
1978) they are lower than the latter and they are only slightly greater&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
in 1975.   The value of social consumption from the input-output&#13;
table for 1977 seems to be out of line and has to be recalculated.&#13;
In order to calculate social consumption of material goods and non-&#13;
material services for 1980 for which there is no CSO's estimate of NNP,and to&#13;
recalculate it for 1977 to make it consistent with other figures, the&#13;
ratio of social consumption in NNP tV budgetary expenditures on social&#13;
consumption has been calculated for those years for which data are&#13;
available.   The ratio tends to increase over time.    Taking this&#13;
tendency into consideration a consistent ratio was assumed for the&#13;
years for which it could not be calculated.    Applying these ratios,&#13;
the value of social consumption was estimated for those years for which&#13;
it was not available or seemed to be out of line with the corresponding&#13;
figures in other years.   It appears that these estimated values are&#13;
consistent with the available values.&#13;
4.    Estimates of GNP at Current Prices&#13;
With the help of data presented in Tables II.3 and II.4 on&#13;
consumption and the investment data from the NNMP statistics, the&#13;
available estimates of NNP have been checked and the missing estimates&#13;
calculated. The values of depreciation in material production and in&#13;
housing have been calculated from the statistics on GNMP and NNMP and&#13;
depreciation in other non-material services has been taken from&#13;
Table I. 7 . The available and estimated values of NNP and the&#13;
estimated values of GNP are presented in Table II.5.    Again,&#13;
depreciation seems to be somewhat less reliable than other components&#13;
of GNP. It is possible that there is some duplication between the&#13;
three components of depreciation, although a considerable effort has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
been made to avoid it.   Unfortunately, no sufficient information&#13;
is available on how these components are calculated in practice.&#13;
Such duplication would result in an upward bias in the GNP estimates.&#13;
On the other hand, as it has been noted before, the depreciation&#13;
rates in Poland are low and there might be an overall downward bias&#13;
even if our calculations overestimate depreciation by including&#13;
some duplication.&#13;
The accuracy of these estimates depends,of course, on how&#13;
correct are various assumptions on which they depend.    Their acceptance&#13;
is subject to the general qualification concerning the quality of&#13;
statistics reported in different statistical sources from which the&#13;
raw materials for the estimates have been supplied.&#13;
Unfortunately, again, the estimates for 1970 and 1980 are&#13;
the least reliable, the former because of many changes in definitions&#13;
and methods and the latter because it requires a larger number of&#13;
assumptions for its calculation than other estimates for the lack of&#13;
published data.&#13;
The GNP values for 1975, 1977, 1978 and 1979 from CSO's&#13;
memorandum available in the World Bank are also presented in Table II.5&#13;
for comparison with the estimated values.    They are higher than our&#13;
estimates but the two sets seem to be approximately consistent.&#13;
In order to check the sensitivity of the estimates to possible&#13;
mistakes in the assumptions on which the GNP components have been&#13;
calculated, Table II.6 presents the impact of a 10% increase in the&#13;
value of each of the following components on the value of GNP:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
(1) consumption from personal incomes; (2) consumption from social&#13;
funds;  (3) social consumption;  and (4) total depreciation.    An&#13;
increase in consumption from personal incomes would have the greatest&#13;
impact on the value of GNP but even here a 10% increase would increase&#13;
GNP by less than 6%.   This component of GNP can be regarded as&#13;
perhaps the most reliable  of the four selected.    Statistics on&#13;
consumption from personal incomes have been collected and published&#13;
for a long time.   The other two component parts of consumption seem&#13;
to be more unreliable, judging by, for example, certain inconsistences&#13;
which can be observed in Table II.5.   A miscalculation would not,&#13;
however, have a great impact on the value of GNP.    A 10% increase in&#13;
the value of consumption from social funds would have the biggest&#13;
impact in 1980, but it would still be only 0.82% increase in the estimated&#13;
value of GNP. A 10% increase in the value of social consumption would&#13;
increase the estimated value of GNP by less than 1% in 1970 and 1975 and&#13;
by only about 1% in 1979 and 1980.   A 10% increase in total depreciation&#13;
would have only slightly greater impact.&#13;
It seems that the estimates of depreciation and social consumption&#13;
are the least reliable components of GNP.   However, even if one of them&#13;
was subject to a miscalculation by 20%, the impact of that mistake&#13;
on the estimated value of GNP would only be about 2%.&#13;
In all estimates the value of investment in fixed capital and changes&#13;
in inventories have been accepted as published in statistical yearbooks&#13;
without any attempt to provide an independent recalculation. This is,&#13;
however,-a component in which some serious mistakes are possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
5.    The Net National Material Product to Gross National Product Ratio&#13;
The ratios of various components of NNMP and NNP, of their total&#13;
values and those of GNMP to GNP are presented in Table II.5.    The ratio&#13;
is relatively stable in consumption expenditures from personal incomes&#13;
and varies from 96.15 in 1970 to 96.53 in 1980.    The ratio is very&#13;
unstable in social consumption confirming the view that these estimates&#13;
are not very reliable. The ratio of total consumption of material&#13;
goods to total consumption of material goods and non-material services&#13;
fluctuated subject to a declining trend. It was 87.19% in 1970 but&#13;
only 85.98% in 1980. A particularly strong decline between 1978&#13;
and 1980 was associated, as we remember, with an absolute decline&#13;
in the output of material goods and reflects a relatively high degree&#13;
of stability of non-material services.&#13;
The ratio of the total value of NNMP to the total value of NNP&#13;
was relatively stable in 1970, 1975, 1977 and 1978 but declined in the&#13;
two subsequent years, reflecting the same developments. The ratio&#13;
of GNMP to GNP shows the same pattern.&#13;
The ratios of the total value of NNMP as presented in statistics&#13;
calculated according to the MPS method, to the CSO and alternative&#13;
estimates of GNP are as follows:&#13;
1970   1975   1977   1978   1979   1980&#13;
CSO estimates          n.a.  81.00  81.52   81.05  79.72   n.a.&#13;
Alternative estimates 79.35   82.06  82.13  81.65  80.29  78.65&#13;
The main conclusion which can be derived from the above figures&#13;
is that the ratio NNMP/GNP is unstable and is strongly affected&#13;
by economic fluctuations. It increased during the expansion of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
first half of the 1970's and continued a slight increase until 1977&#13;
but declined rapidly in 1978, 1979 and 1980 as the result of a strong&#13;
downswing in economic activity.&#13;
6.    Structure of Net National Material Product and Gross National&#13;
Product According to Use&#13;
The share of consumption and investment in Net National Material&#13;
Product and the share of consumption, net investment and depreciation&#13;
in Gross National Product (the CSO and alternative estimates) are&#13;
presented in Table II.7.   The same pattern is shown by all three sets&#13;
of figures.   The share of investment increased during the expansion&#13;
of the first half of the 1970's and declined rapidly.    In 1980 it was&#13;
considerably below that of 1970.   In every year for which CSO's&#13;
estimates of GNP are available, they show the share of net investment&#13;
slightly smaller and the share of consumption greater than the&#13;
alternative estimates.   The latter show smaller share of depreciation&#13;
than the  former.   An earlier GUS estimate, calculated according to the&#13;
SNA method in NCUs, shows in 1975 the share of consumption of 60.6%&#13;
and that of gross investment 39.4% of the GNP, and the share of&#13;
consumption of 66.7% and net investment 33.3% of the NNP.35    This is&#13;
a lower share of consumption than in our estimates, according to which&#13;
in 1975 the share of consumption was 62.5% of GNP and 69.1% of NNP.&#13;
It is not clear whether the imputed rents were included in the GUS&#13;
estimates.   It is also possible that in our estimates the value of&#13;
social consumption has been overstated.   Taking into consideration&#13;
the calculations presented in Table II.6 most likely it is a cummulative&#13;
effect of overestimation in more than one item in our 1975 estimate in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
comparison with the GUS estimate and it is, of course, impossible to say&#13;
kliich of the two is more accurate.&#13;
For comparison purposes the structure of NNMP at constant&#13;
January 1977 prices is presented in Table II.8.    It shows a very&#13;
rapid increase in the share of investment during the first half of the&#13;
1970's and an even more rapid decline in the second half of the decade&#13;
with a corresponding decline and a subsequent increase in the share of&#13;
consumption.&#13;
It is clearly seen that the structure of NNMP according to use&#13;
was very unstable during the 1970's and that the structure of GNP&#13;
had also to be very unstable despite a stabilizing effect of services&#13;
and depreciation. It is important to remember that the structure&#13;
at constant prices is affected by some continuously present price&#13;
distortions and that changes in these distortions were not fully&#13;
reflected in the changes of price indices for reasons which will be&#13;
discussed in the next section.&#13;

III.  COMMENTS ON PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF PRICE&#13;
FORMATION, TAXATION, SUBSIDIZATION&#13;
1. Principles and Methods of Price Formation&#13;
The price system which was in operation in Poland during&#13;
the 1970's was basically an administered prices system with&#13;
market prices practcally limited to transactions in the market&#13;
places, i.e. outside the socialist sector of the economy.&#13;
A major price reform was effected as from January 1,1971. It&#13;
modified the principles and methods of price formation and&#13;
resulted in an overall increase in prices. Statistics for 1970&#13;
were at that time recalculated at the new prices.&#13;
In the Polish theory and practice of price formation six&#13;
types of prices are distinguished, taking the nature of transac-&#13;
tions into consideration as a basis: (1) the factory prices&#13;
(ceny fabryczne) at which the producers in the socialist sector&#13;
sell their output; (2) the realized prices (ceny zbytu) at&#13;
which socialist organizations (other production enterprises,&#13;
wholesale trade, etc.) obtain producer goods within the socialist&#13;
sector; (3) the wholesale prices (ceny hurtowe) at which the&#13;
retail outlets obtain goods (consumption goods and producer&#13;
goods purchased by the population, including those for private&#13;
agriculture, construction, handicrafts and private services&#13;
establishments); (4) the retail prices (ceny detaliczne)&#13;
at which consumers obtain goods and services: (5) the procure-&#13;
ment prices (ceny skupu) at which the socialist procurement&#13;
organizations obtain agricultural produce (before the abolish-&#13;
ment of obligatory deliveries as from January 1, 1972, these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
prices were differentiated for the delivery quotas - lower&#13;
prices, and for the above quota deliveries - higher prices);&#13;
(6) the market prices at the market places at which the&#13;
population buys consumption goods, mainly agricultural produce,&#13;
from individual farmers.&#13;
The factory prices are determined as the average cost&#13;
of producing a given product in all enterprises which produce&#13;
it (during the 1970's these were the average costs within&#13;
the industrial association that was the main producer of the&#13;
commodity) increased by a profit margin calculated according&#13;
to the following formula:&#13;
= a + b + c ioo&#13;
k&#13;
where:&#13;
S = profit margin to be applied as percentage of the average&#13;
cost of production of a product;&#13;
a = 3% of the gross fixed capital stock used in the production&#13;
process;&#13;
b = 5% of the net fixed capital stock used in the production&#13;
process;&#13;
c = 3% of the total cost of gross material output;&#13;
k = total cost of the commodity production.&#13;
The profit margin calculated according to this formula is&#13;
subsequently adjusted to take into consideration: (1) the&#13;
association's need for finance to cover the cost of expansion&#13;
or of some approved social funds ( i.e. for cultural,&#13;
recreational, social etc. amenities); (2) the price of close&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
substitutes.36&#13;
The formula was apparently devised in order to take&#13;
into consideration different conditions in various industries:&#13;
their capital - intensity and current operation cost. In&#13;
practice almost every association constructed prices differently.&#13;
About 72% of the profit depends in the formula on the size&#13;
of the fixed capital stock and only 28% on the cost of production.&#13;
This was regarded at the time as a great improvement over the&#13;
old price formation formula which was simply a given percentage&#13;
of current operating costs which did not include cost of fixed&#13;
capital.&#13;
The realized price is equal to the factory price plus&#13;
the turnover tax, which is the main financial instrument used&#13;
to transfer a part of accumulation to the state budget, plus&#13;
the price equalization tax (if the realized price is relatively&#13;
high in comparison with the factory price).&#13;
The wholesale price is the realized price increased&#13;
by a margin to cover the cost and operating surplus of&#13;
wholesale trade and the retail price is the wholesale price&#13;
increased by a margin to cover the cost and operating surplus&#13;
of the retail operations. At all stages the prices are calcu-&#13;
lated on the cost plus a fixed percentage profit margin basis&#13;
with the margins differentiated for different industries,&#13;
enterprises and products.&#13;
In the case of consumption goods which are regarded&#13;
as important for the standard of living of the population&#13;
the desired retail price is taken as a starting point. It&#13;
may or may not be a market equilibrium price. The cost and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
operating surplus of retailing and, subsequently, the cost and&#13;
operating surplus of wholesale operations are deducted to&#13;
obtain the realized price which is above or below the factory&#13;
price with the price equalization tax or subsidy covering the&#13;
difference after a turnover tax was deducted.38&#13;
The 1971 price reform made an important modification in&#13;
the method according to which prices of imports and exports are&#13;
calculated. In the case of imported raw materials and interme-&#13;
diate goods which were regarded as particularly important, the&#13;
prices were calculated as the average prices that were actually&#13;
paid over the period of the preceeding two years in foreign&#13;
currencies converted into NCUs by using conversion coefficients&#13;
differenciated according to the market from which the commodities&#13;
were imported. For other imports the "deviza transaction prices"&#13;
were determined as actually paid prices in foreign currencies&#13;
converted into NCUs with the help of the conversion coefficients.&#13;
The prices of exported raw materials and agricultural products&#13;
were determined at the same level as for the domestic market,&#13;
irrespective of prices actually received in the foreign markets.&#13;
The prices of manufactured goods were the "deviza tranaction&#13;
prices", i.e. the prices actually received in the foreign trade&#13;
transactions converted into NCUs with the help of the conversion&#13;
coefficients.39&#13;
The reform resulted in very wide differences in the&#13;
size of operating surpluses among industries and within them.&#13;
For example, the association of construction ceramics had the&#13;
margin of 21% and the association of meat processing only 3.9%.4o&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
According to this practiceof price formation changes&#13;
in the operating surplus are, therefore, effected as a policy&#13;
decision. With a high degree of price distortion high profits&#13;
do not necesserily indicate that a particular commodity is&#13;
produces efficiently and losses do not necesserily imply that&#13;
this commodity is not produced efficiently. Profits and losses&#13;
exist, first of all, as the result of the adoption of particular&#13;
prices. Overall price revisions are introduced from time to&#13;
time. Hundreds of thousands of prices are changed at the same&#13;
time by the State Price Commission. These revisions usually&#13;
change profitability and unprofitability in various sectors&#13;
of the economy and make changes in the price equalization&#13;
taxes and subsidies necessary. There is usually a tendency&#13;
to reduce the degree of price distortion at the time of the&#13;
price revisions and the total value of price equalization&#13;
payments tends to decline. Price revisions also change the&#13;
relative share of various sectors in NDMP and, therefore, GDP&#13;
and they alter the relative relation of consumption and&#13;
investment in NNMP and GNP.&#13;
2. Changes in the Price Level&#13;
The impact of the 1971 price revision on the values&#13;
of NDMP and NNMP and on their component parts is shown in&#13;
table III.1. While industrial prices slightly declined because&#13;
of a small reduction in the calculation of operating surpluses41&#13;
prices in other sectors were increased.&#13;
In 1973 a new financial and economic system was&#13;
introduced which gave greater autonomy to the so called "big&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
economic organizations" ( WOG ) in price formation. Although&#13;
the majority of prices remained fixed by central authorities,&#13;
the big economic organizations were able to apply for a revision&#13;
of some specific prices. Particularly important was the deter-&#13;
mination of prices for new products. Some of these products&#13;
were virually unchanged. Others were only slightly modified,&#13;
but the old, cheaper products were removed from the market or&#13;
were continued to be produced      only in very small quantities.&#13;
Any control in these matters was difficult, especially because&#13;
there were strong vested interests in the enterprises, where&#13;
bonuses and the size of various enterprise funds for social&#13;
amenities, modernization and small expansions depended on the&#13;
value of realized output, as well as in the industrial branch&#13;
administrations which encouraged, or at least did not discourage,&#13;
measures which improved statistical performance in a particular&#13;
sector of the economy or a branch of industry. Judging by the&#13;
frequency with which Polish economists discussed this problem&#13;
during the 1970's it was of a significant importance. 42&#13;
The next overall price revisions took place in three&#13;
stages in 1976 - 78 with the January 1, 1977 prices accepted&#13;
as the new 'constant prices" for national accounts. Among&#13;
other features the revision contained: (a) a change in the&#13;
principle of the determination of prices for new products;&#13;
and (b) an attempt to better express the quality of products&#13;
in the price differentials.43&#13;
The impact of the 1977 price revision on the values-&#13;
of NDMP, NNMP and their components in 1975 is presented in&#13;
Table III.1. Again, the revision affected differently various&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
sectors of the economy and types of expenditures, and it changed&#13;
the estimates of total NDMP and NNMP and, therefore,GDP and GNP.&#13;
Statistics concerning price changes in individual indus-&#13;
tries were published for the first time in 1981.44 They are&#13;
presented in Table III.2. It appears that in the socialist&#13;
industry most of the big price changes took place in 1976 as&#13;
the result of the overall price revision which was started in&#13;
that year. In some branches of industry these changes were&#13;
continued during the subsequent years. Except in the case of&#13;
the non ferrous metallurgy and, to a much smaller extent, the&#13;
metal working, textile, food processing and leather goods&#13;
industries, prices seemed to be stabilized in 1979 and 1980.&#13;
In the socialist industry as a whole prices increased by 25.4%&#13;
between 1975 and 1980 with the biggest increases effected in&#13;
the non-ferrous metallurgy ( 61.5% ), the leather goods&#13;
industry (53.6%) and the feeds industry (47.0%). As can be&#13;
seen in table Table III.2, although industrial prices are&#13;
revised usually in one big operation, some changes (increases&#13;
as well as decreases) take plce also between the major price&#13;
revisions.&#13;
The index of the prices of goods and services purchased&#13;
by the population has been published since the late 1950's&#13;
and has been used to calculate real wages and, later, real&#13;
personal incomes. Like most other official indices of this&#13;
nature, it shows only the movements in the prices of a given&#13;
basket of goods, and the authorities can manipulate the results&#13;
by the selection of the basket, by holding down those prices&#13;
which are prominent in the selected basket and by ignoring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
the prices of new products. The stability of the official&#13;
index which was held during the 1960's ended in 1973 ( see&#13;
Table III.3). The index of goods and services for consumption&#13;
purposes indicates an increase of 57.1% in prices betwee 1970&#13;
and 1980. The index of goods and services purchased by the&#13;
population for non-consumption purposes, which include buil-&#13;
ding materials for private housing, cost of repairs, and the&#13;
supply of non-consumption goods for private farmers, private&#13;
freight transport services etc., increased during that period&#13;
by 64.1%. As one would expect the biggest increase took place&#13;
in food prices at the market places (180.7%).&#13;
Three observations can be made in connection with the&#13;
movement of prices of goods and services purchased by the&#13;
population: (1) the planners seem to prefer big adjustments&#13;
made from time to time rather than gradual increases every&#13;
year, probably for administrative reasons, despite the fact&#13;
that this approach may be politically less desirable; (2) there&#13;
is a tendency to adjust upward different component parts of&#13;
the index at different times in order to reduce the total&#13;
impact in any one year; and (3) there was a time lag between&#13;
the world price inflation and the main adjustment in the prices&#13;
of goods and services purchased by the population, most of&#13;
which occured in 1974 and 1976.&#13;
Changes in prices of some specific noh-material&#13;
services are presented in Table III.4. The overall increases&#13;
in the prices of some services during 1970 - 80 were quite&#13;
substantial. For example, in post and telecommunications the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
increase in prices was 142.7% and in education 137.0%.&#13;
A comparison of food prices in the socialist trade and&#13;
in the market places is presented in Table III.5. As can be&#13;
expected, the disparity in the annual rates of growth and in&#13;
the overall increases for 1970 - 80 is quite considerable.&#13;
Most of the big price increases took place in 1976 -80. Even&#13;
the private trade prices were relatively stable in 1971 - 75,&#13;
except the prices of vegetables and fruits in 1971 and 1974.&#13;
The official cost of living index is presented in&#13;
Table III.6. It is composed of three separate parts: (1) the&#13;
cost of living of the households of employees in the socialist&#13;
economy - this index is used to calculate real wages; (2) the&#13;
cost of living of households of individual farmers; and (3) the&#13;
cost of living of the households of the retired employees and&#13;
those receiving workers' compensation. Apparently the second&#13;
index registered a lower increase in prices than the first&#13;
and the change in the third was the smallest of the three.&#13;
The index is based on the prices of about 1600 commodities&#13;
and services and on three systems of weights, each for a dif-&#13;
ferent group of households. The weights were determined on the&#13;
basis of household budgets. For 1975 the weights represent&#13;
expenses in 1970 and for 1980 those in 1979.45&#13;
Indices of nominal and real personal incomes and the&#13;
price changes implied by these indices are also presented in&#13;
Table III.6 for comparison with the official cost of living&#13;
index. Total personal incomes are divided into: (1) monetary,&#13;
and (2) non-monetary incomes. The latter are composed of&#13;
services which are provided free of charge or the subsidy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
component in the case of services for which only nominal prices&#13;
are charged. They include education, culture, health and social&#13;
welfare, physical education, sports, tourism and vacation services.&#13;
The official cost of living takes into consideration those&#13;
price changes which affect monetary incomes and there is only&#13;
a slight discrepancy between the price changes recorded by the&#13;
cost of living index and the price changes implied by the index&#13;
of real monetary personal incomes. However, the implied price&#13;
changes of non-monetary incomes are considerably higher. While&#13;
the official cost of living increased by 56.5% in 1970 - 80,&#13;
the implied price change affecting non-monetary incomes increased&#13;
by 132.4%. This is the price adjustment applicable for the&#13;
deflation of the value of non-material services in the real GDP&#13;
estimates and of consumption other than personal incomes in&#13;
the real GNP estimates.&#13;
It should, however, be pointed out that the officially&#13;
calculated indices have been subject to a particularly strong&#13;
criticism by Polish economists.46 One of the factors which can&#13;
distort the price index is the selection of weights. The&#13;
structure of consumption expenditures from personal incomes in 1965&#13;
was used as the system of weights for 1970, the 1970 structure&#13;
as weights for 1975 and the 1979 structure for 1980. As can be&#13;
seen in Table III.7, the share of expenditures on food declined&#13;
between 1970 and 1980. The total food prices increased more&#13;
rapidly than the prices of goods and services for consumption&#13;
purposes: by 61.5% as compared with 57.1%. As there is a&#13;
substantial difference between prices in the socialist trade&#13;
and in the market places in respect of food as a whole and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
for individual items ( see Table III.5 ), the distribution of&#13;
expenditures between the two can affect the cost of living index.&#13;
If. in the construction of the index, the share of,for example,&#13;
vegetables purchased from the socialist trade is accepted as&#13;
larger than it is in reality, the index will be downward biased&#13;
and this bias will be very difficult to discover.&#13;
Finally, the implied NDMP and NNMP price deflators&#13;
are presented in table III.8. The constant 1971 prices were&#13;
used for the period 1970 - 76 and the constant 1977 prices&#13;
for 1977 - 80. Prices remain relatively stable until 1974.&#13;
First big increases in prices took place in 1975 and 1976. This&#13;
was the time when both the imported and the domestically generated&#13;
inflationary pressures started to appear in the economy.47&#13;
The 1977 price revision did not stabilize the prices.&#13;
The NDMP deflator at the 1977 prices shows an increase by 13.75%&#13;
between January 1, 1977 and the end of 1979 and by 21.07% in 1980.&#13;
The corresponding increases shown by the NNMP deflator at the&#13;
1977 prices are 16.79% and 26.36%. For the whole 1970 - 80 period&#13;
the NDMP deflator shows an increase by 52.81% and the NNMP&#13;
deflator by 61.98%.&#13;
3.    Taxes, Subsidies and Price Distortions&#13;
As has been pointed out before,the turnover tax is used&#13;
to transfer a part of the operating surplus ("financial accumu-&#13;
lation") from the socialist enterprises to the state budget.&#13;
Sometimes this tax is, however, also used to isolate an increase&#13;
in the retail, wholesale or realized price. In order to&#13;
prevent the producer to gain from a windfall'gain the turnover&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
tax is used to absorb the difference. In theory only the gains&#13;
from increasing output or reducing costs are regarded as earned&#13;
by the enterprise. Similarly, losses resulting from lowering&#13;
prices by the authorities are not regarded as losses for which&#13;
the enterprise should be financially responsible. A reduction&#13;
in the turnover tax is used in this situation to isolate the&#13;
reduction in prices at the retail, wholesale or realized price&#13;
level. The rates of the turnover tax widely differ, therefore,&#13;
not only as between various sectors but also within the sectors&#13;
and the turnover tax ratios are unstable over time. Because&#13;
the turnover tax is used in this way it is difficult to dis-&#13;
tinguish it from the price equalization tax which is also used&#13;
to absorb the difference when the retail, wholesale or realized&#13;
prices are fixed at a high level and the producers are not&#13;
supposed to gain from this decision.&#13;
When the administered prices are fixed below the average&#13;
cost of production in a given industrial association, there&#13;
are some enterprises that produce at loss. There may even be&#13;
the entire industries for which the administered prices do not&#13;
cover their costs. Losses are financed from the state budget&#13;
with the help of the price equalization subsidies. There are&#13;
also other subsidies which are given to some specific enter-&#13;
prises. As their role does not differ from that of the price&#13;
equalization subsidies, all subsidies are usually added together&#13;
in public finance statistics.&#13;
Total financial accumulation in the socialist economy,&#13;
and in its various sectors, is, therefore, equal to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
turnover tax plus the price equalization taxes minus the price&#13;
equalization subsidies plus profits of those enterprises which&#13;
make profits and minus losses of those enterprises which make&#13;
planned or unplanned losses.&#13;
Usually one of the purposes of the overall price revi-&#13;
sions is to eliminate, or at least to reduce, price distortions&#13;
and to reduce taxes and subsidies. The 1971 reform reduced&#13;
both, the price equalization taxes and subsidies in that year.&#13;
The 1977 reform reduced the price equalization taxes only (see&#13;
Table III.9).&#13;
Net taxes paid by the socialist enterprises to the&#13;
state budget declined quite rapidly from one year to another&#13;
in 1970 - 1974. They increased in the two susequent years,&#13;
declined in 1977 and then increased from one year to another&#13;
very rapidly as the result of increases in prices which occurred&#13;
during that time.&#13;
The sum of the price equalization taxes and subsidies&#13;
show the extent to which prices are distorted. The more they&#13;
are distorted the larger is the sum. The ratio of that sum&#13;
to the value of NDMP at current prices can be accepted as an&#13;
index of the degree of price distortion in the economy. The&#13;
price equalization system applies only to the socialist sector.&#13;
Other taxes which are imposed on the private agriculture,&#13;
handicrafts and services, and on the population are not here&#13;
included.&#13;
The degree of price distortion, measured in this way,&#13;
declined from 49.4% in 1970 to 28.2% as the result of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
the first price revision. The 1977 revision had a much smaller&#13;
impact on the degree of price distortion. The index declined&#13;
from 46.9% in 1976 to 46.2% in 1978. The degree of price&#13;
distortion of 49.4% that appeared in 1970 was not surpassed&#13;
again until 1979 and 1980 when it became 51.8% and 65.7% (see&#13;
Table III.8).&#13;
The sum of taxes, subsidies, profits and losses represents&#13;
the extent to which prices within the economy diverse from the&#13;
costs of production and the ratio of this sum to the value of&#13;
NDMP at current prices can be accepted as an index of the&#13;
relative importance of these differences in the economy. Prices&#13;
were brought closer to the costs of production in 1970 -72,&#13;
then the ratio increased in 1973 - 75, fluctuated below the&#13;
1975 level in 1976 - 78 and rapidly increased in 1979 and 1980.&#13;
In Table III.10 the financial accumulation, taxes and&#13;
subsidies in the socialist economy are presented for its main&#13;
sectors. There are considerable differences between the shares&#13;
of the sectoral NDMP in the total NDMP and the shares of the&#13;
sectoral NDMP adjusted for taxes and subsidies in the total&#13;
NDMP adjusted in the same way. The latter values are close&#13;
to the NDMP at factor costs. Although indirect taxes on the&#13;
private sector seem to be collected by fixing prices in the&#13;
socialist trade supplying, for example individual agriculture&#13;
and by the state purchasing agencies, there may be some indirect&#13;
taxes which are not included in the values presented in Table III.10.&#13;
The degree of subsidization (the ratio of subsidies to&#13;
the value of NDMP at current prices, or index "a") differs&#13;
widely between the sectors and within them over time. For&#13;
example, as the result of a shift of the collection of taxes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
and payment of subsidies from commerce to the sector producing&#13;
various commodities, the degree of subsidization declined in&#13;
commerce after 1975 while it increased in industry and agricul-&#13;
ture. Except for construction and forestry, the degree of&#13;
subsidization is relatively high in all sectors and it has had&#13;
a tendency to increase over time. The degree of price distortion,&#13;
as measured by the ratio of the sum of taxes and subsidies to&#13;
the value of NDMP at current prices (index "b") and the extent&#13;
to which prices differ from costs, as measured by the ratio&#13;
of the sum of taxes, subsidies, profits and losses to the value&#13;
of NDMP at current prices ( index "c") show similar variations&#13;
between sectors and over time. All these indices suggest not&#13;
only that there are serious price distortions in the Polish&#13;
economy, but also that these distortions are not equally dis-&#13;
tributed among various sectors and that their size changes&#13;
over time.&#13;
Arbitrary prices, based on costs plus a fixed profit&#13;
margin and changes in them effected by the central bodies, as&#13;
well as by the enterprises themeselves, without concern about&#13;
the supply and demand conditions affect all relationships within&#13;
the economy, including value added, financial accumulation,&#13;
the possibility to meet the wage bill, the level of depreciation,&#13;
share of various sectors, etc.48&#13;
In this situation it is difficult to calculate real&#13;
rates of growth and real changes in the structure of NDMP and&#13;
NNMP and, therefore, GDP and GNP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV.   CONVERSION COEFFICIENTS&#13;
1.    Official and Special Rates of Exchange&#13;
The rate of exchange system, which was in operation&#13;
during the 1970's, was established in 1950 and has now been&#13;
changed as from January lst,1982. The official rate of exchange&#13;
was determined in terms of gold in a purely arbitrary way&#13;
without any reference to the actual gold and/or foreign exchange&#13;
reserves. In 1950 one zloty was declared to be equal to one&#13;
ruble and, therefore, equal to the value of 0.222168 grammes&#13;
of gold and US $ 0.25. Domestic currency was not convertible&#13;
into gold or foreign currencies and the domestic prices were&#13;
unaffected by the foreign trade prices. The latter were expressed&#13;
in "deviza zloty" which was the foreign currency price converted&#13;
at the official rate of exchange. Until 1978 the official rate&#13;
of exchange was, through its relation to the value of gold,&#13;
fixed in terms of US dollars. Afterwards, because of dollar's&#13;
instability, it was fixed in terms of a basket of twelve&#13;
Western currencies.49&#13;
In February 1957 a "special rate' of US $ = 24 zloty&#13;
was established for foreign non-commodity transactions. The&#13;
rate is published by the National Bank of Poland (NBP) and is&#13;
determined to approximate an equilibrium rate for non-commodity&#13;
transactions. This rate differs, however, considerably from&#13;
the rate that would ensure equilibrium in the non-commodity trade.&#13;
While foreign trade statistics were reported in deviza zloty&#13;
until the end of 1981, i.e. converted from the foreign currency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
prices into NCUs at the official rate, it was recognized that&#13;
there values could not be used for planning and financial control.&#13;
Between 1959 and 1971 the special commercial rate was used for&#13;
this purpose and the price equalization transactions in con-&#13;
nection with the foreign trade operations were calculated&#13;
with its help.50 Conversion coefficients, differentiated for&#13;
transactions with other CMEA countries and the rest of the world,&#13;
were introduced in 1966 to relate the bonuses earned by exporters&#13;
to the actual value of export. These coefficients have been&#13;
used since 1971 for the price equalization operations. Trade&#13;
statistics recalculated at the conversion coefficients are higher&#13;
than they would have been if the value of trade were recalculated&#13;
from deviza zloty at the special commercial rates.&#13;
While the value of US dollar was declining during the&#13;
1970's at the official rate of exchange, it increased considerably&#13;
during the second half of the decade at the special commercial&#13;
rate of exchange. Changes in the two rates were as follows:52&#13;
Exchange of US $ into zloty&#13;
Official rate    Special commercial rate&#13;
Until Dec 31,1971           4.000                 24.00&#13;
1972                        3.676                1&#13;
1973 - 1977                 3.322               f&#13;
1978                        3.165                 31.87&#13;
1979                        3.o86                 30.01&#13;
1980                        3.058                 30.00&#13;
Neither the official nor the special rates of exchange&#13;
are related to the purchasing power rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
2.   The Purchasing Power Rates&#13;
On the basis of comparative studies of purchasing power&#13;
in (1) Austria and Poland, and (2) France and Poland53, CSO&#13;
estimated the following purchasing power rates of dollar to&#13;
zloty for consumption expenditures from personal incomes for&#13;
the period 1970 -74:   US $1= 22.46 zloty in 1970,  22.56 in 1971,&#13;
21.92 in 1972, 18.90 in 1973 and 17.60 in 1974.    On this basis&#13;
CSO estimated the parity rates of exchange for the whole GNP:&#13;
US $1= 24.7 zloty in 1970 and 20.6 in 1974.54&#13;
For 1974 CSO accepted the following disaggregated rates&#13;
of exchange of US dollar into zloty:&#13;
(1) consumption from individual incomes        17.6 zloty&#13;
(2) consumption from "social funds"            15.6 zloty&#13;
(3) investment in machines and equipment       40.1 zloty&#13;
(4) construction                               19.2 zloty&#13;
(5) total accumulation                         31.7 zloty&#13;
There were some opinions in Poland that the dollar&#13;
into zloty rates for consumption from personal incomes were&#13;
downward biased and some authors quoted therefore also the&#13;
estimates made by the Statistical Office of the Federal Republic&#13;
of Germany which are lower for 1971 -72 but higher for 1973 - 74&#13;
than the above rates: US $ 1 = 22.14 zloty in 1970, 21.42 in&#13;
1971. 20.71 in 1972, 19.03 in 1973 and 18.01 in 197455.&#13;
Some Polish authors suggested that the purchasing power&#13;
rate of exchange in 1978 was US $1= 20 zloty.56    The parity&#13;
rates are,of course, considerably lower than the black market&#13;
rate of exchange of dollar which in 1978 apparently was&#13;
US $1= 125 zloty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
No purchasing power rates for other years have been&#13;
available to the author of this paper. An estimate could be&#13;
made, for example, by using a very detailed comparative study&#13;
58&#13;
of the price levels in France and Poland in 1971 - 72    and&#13;
adjusting the prices for price movements in the two countries.&#13;
This would, however, be a very time consuming exercise.&#13;
3.   Conversion Coefficients&#13;
When conversion coefficients were introduced in 1971&#13;
their value was not published.59 Published informations on&#13;
the value of coefficients appeared for the first time in 1980.&#13;
At that time the coefficient was 45 zloty to one US dollar,&#13;
or 14.5 zloty to one "deviza zloty".60 This value of the&#13;
coefficient was maintained until the end of June 1981. It was&#13;
applied to all transactions with the so called second region&#13;
of payments, i.e. with a non-CMEA countries.   In all transactions&#13;
with the first region of payments (CMEA) the coefficient was&#13;
one transfer ruble to 44.44 zloty.&#13;
As from July 1, 1981 the value of the coefficient&#13;
applicable to transactions with the second region was raised&#13;
to US $1 = 55 zloty. In September 1981 the authorities&#13;
anounced that as from January 1,1982 the value of the coefficients&#13;
would be changed to: lruble = 55 zloty, and US $1 = 65 zloty.&#13;
On December 22,1981 the value was, however,changed tos 1 ruble=&#13;
68 zloty: and US $1 = 80 zloty. At the same time the official&#13;
rates of exchange, the fiction of gold parity and the use of&#13;
deviza zloty) as well as special exchange rates were all abolished&#13;
and the coefficients were accepted as a uniform rate of exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
for all foreign transactions. Except for the black market,&#13;
the existence of which is acknowledged, the only other exception&#13;
is provided by basic raw materials and intermediate goods. Their&#13;
new prices were introduced as a part of the major price revision&#13;
effected as from January 1, 1982. The prices were, however,&#13;
calculated on the basis of US $1 = 50.00 zloty, the value of&#13;
the coefficient when hundreds of thousand prices were determined&#13;
by the State Price Commission and numerous price lists were&#13;
printed. In other words, all foreign trade transactions are&#13;
taking place and are reported at the new uniform rate of exchange,&#13;
except those involving the most important raw materials and&#13;
intermediate goods. Soon after the introduction of the uniform&#13;
rate of exchange it was recognized that the value of the&#13;
coefficient for transactions with the second region must be&#13;
raised to US $1 = 100 zloty and that the prices of basic raw&#13;
materials and intermediate goods should be recalculated on this&#13;
basis. 61&#13;
The coefficients are said to be calculated as the average&#13;
cost of earning a unit of convertible currencies in export to&#13;
capitalist countries, increased by a fixed margin which in 1980&#13;
was 30%.62 However, the average cost of obtaining one US dollar&#13;
in export to capitalist countries is given elsewhere as 34.82 zloty&#13;
( see Table IV.1 ). This value plus a 30% margin would give&#13;
the value of the coefficient for transactions with the second&#13;
region equal to 46.43 and not 50.00 in 1980.&#13;
If statistics presented in the table are correct, there&#13;
was a rapid reduction in the cost of earning one dollar in export&#13;
to capitalist countries between 1971 and 1975 (a reduction from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
54.00 to 31.21). The cost increased in 1976 and 1977 and started&#13;
to decline again in 1978 - 80. The table shows substantial&#13;
sectoral differences with the export of agricultural products&#13;
and food having the highest cost of obtaining one dollar (48.89)&#13;
and fuels and power the lowest (18.32) in 1980. Moreover sectoral&#13;
costs seem to be unstable and there are considerable fluctuations&#13;
from one year to another.&#13;
Although these statistics have been obtained from an&#13;
official government report, published in 1981, it is impossible&#13;
to assess their accuracy and to determine the degree of confi-&#13;
dence with which they can be accepted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. GROWTH RATES&#13;
1.   Availability of Published Statistics in Constant Prices&#13;
CSO's statistics on the annual rates of growth of Net&#13;
Domestic Material Product and Net National Material Product&#13;
and their main component parts are presented in Table V.1.&#13;
They have been calculated in "constant 1971 prices" for 1970 - 75&#13;
and "constant 1977 prices" for 1975 - 80 with the two sets linked&#13;
by the chain index method.&#13;
No *statistics are published on the rates of growth of&#13;
GDP and GNP in constant prices and no estimates of the levels&#13;
of GDP and GNP in constant prices are available. The starting&#13;
point is, therefore, the estimation of the values for 1970,&#13;
1975 and 1980. For this purpose the "constant 1977 prices"&#13;
have been accepted. There are statistics on NDMP and NNMP for&#13;
1975 - 80 expressed in these prices and there are two indices&#13;
expressed in them. One accepts the 1970 NDMP level and another&#13;
the 1970 NNMP level as hundred. It is,therefore,possible to&#13;
calculate the value of both NDMP and NNMP   in 1970.&#13;
It is possible to calculate the implied deflator for&#13;
non monetary personal incomes in the constant 1977 prices, i.e.&#13;
the implied increase in the prices of non-material services&#13;
consumed by the population from the so called "social funds"'&#13;
education, culture, health and social welfare and physical&#13;
education, sports tourism and vacation services ( see Table III.6).&#13;
This deflator can, perhaps, be accepted as a reasonable price&#13;
index for other non-material services as well.&#13;
On the national expenditure side there are statistics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
on "consumption from personal incomes", divided into material&#13;
and non-material, calculated in the "constant 1977 prices".&#13;
On the other hand, statistics on depreciation are only&#13;
available at current prices and the only input - output table&#13;
calculated according to the SNA method that is available is&#13;
expressed in the "current 1977 prices". It has not been possible&#13;
to check the reliability of the implied price deflators and the&#13;
extent to which statistics expressed in constant prices are&#13;
free from the effects of price changes. The estimates which&#13;
have been made are, therefore, only as good as the official&#13;
statistics in constant prices which have been used as the basis&#13;
for this calculation. In this connection it is important to&#13;
keep in mind various limitations, including the method of&#13;
the pricing of new products and the disparity between prices&#13;
in the socialist trade and in the market places ( see Table III.5).&#13;
2.   Depreciation at Constant Prices&#13;
In order to estimate depreciation at constant prices&#13;
it is necessary to make some assumptions. The implied sectoral&#13;
rates of depreciation are calculated on the basis of the input -&#13;
output table for 1977 ( see Table V.2). These implied sectoral&#13;
rates of depreciation are then applied to the value of gross&#13;
fixed capital stock expressed in the "constant 1977 prices"&#13;
and the value of depreciation at constant prices is estimated&#13;
in this way for 1970, 1975 and 1980. This estimation is,&#13;
therefore, based on the assumption that the structure of sectoral&#13;
capital stocks remained unchanged during the 1970's. This is&#13;
not, of course, a realistic assumption, especially for a period&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
during which a big investment drive took place. Unfortunately&#13;
there are no data which would make it possible to calculate&#13;
depreciation separately for: (1) buildings, and (2) machines&#13;
and equipment. However, the rates of depreciation vary quite&#13;
considerably between these two types of capital assets.&#13;
The values of total depreciation of capital used in&#13;
the material sphere and in the non-material sphere have been&#13;
calculated as the sums of depreciation in those sectors which&#13;
belong to each sphere.&#13;
The degree of accuracy of the estimates depends on:&#13;
(1) the quality of statistics on depreciation and capital stock&#13;
in the input - output table for 1977; (2) the validity of&#13;
the assumption about the stability of the capital stock&#13;
composition within individual sectors; and (3) the quality of&#13;
statistics on sectoral capital stocks at the "constant 1977&#13;
prices".&#13;
The values of depreciation at constant prices, which&#13;
have been estimated in this way, are used in the estimates of&#13;
both GDP and GNP at constant prices.&#13;
3.   Estimates of GDP at Constant Prices&#13;
The estimates are made on the basis of CSO's NDMP at&#13;
"constant 1977 prices". Net Value Added of Non-material Services&#13;
has been taken from Table I.8 in two alternative estimates (A)&#13;
and (B). The estimates have been converted into the "constant&#13;
1977 prices by using the implied deflator for non-monetary&#13;
personal incomes ( Table III.6). The estimated valuesof depreciation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
at constant prices ( from Table V.2) have been added to obtain&#13;
gross value. The estimates for 1970, 1975 and 1980 are presented&#13;
in Table V.3.&#13;
4.   Estimates of GNP at Constant Prices&#13;
The estimates of GNP at "constant 1977 prices" for 1970,&#13;
1975 and 1980 are presented in Table V.4.&#13;
The values of consumption from personal incomes, both&#13;
material and non-material, at the "constant 1977 prices" have&#13;
been taken from official statistics. Material " other consumption"&#13;
at the"constant 1977 prices" is from the official statistics&#13;
on NNMP at "constant 1977 prices". Non-material "other consumption"&#13;
has been obtained by converting data available at current prices&#13;
into the "constant 1977 prices" by using the implied deflator&#13;
for non-material personal incomes (Table III.6). Investment&#13;
at the "constant 1977 prices" is taken from the NNMP statistics&#13;
at these prices. The estimates of depreciation, in matert'al and&#13;
non-material spheres, are from Table V.2.&#13;
Again, the degree of accuracy of the estimates depends&#13;
on: (1) the assumptions which have been made concerning the&#13;
conversion of non-material "other consumption" and depreciation&#13;
from current to constant prices; and (2) the extent to which&#13;
the official statistics at the "constant 1977 prices" are&#13;
reliable.&#13;
5.   The Rates of Growth of GDP and GNP&#13;
The rates of growth for 1970 - 75, 1975 - 80 and&#13;
1970 - 80 have been calculated from the GDP and GNP estimates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
at the 'iconstant 1977 prices" for 1970, 1975 and 1980, using&#13;
the general formula for establishing exponential functions from&#13;
the end-point values.&#13;
The rates of growth of GDP alternative estimates (A)&#13;
and (B) are compared with CSO's rates of growth of NDMP and&#13;
GNP at 1977 adjusted factor cost estimated by L.W. International&#13;
Financial Research, Inc.63 (see Table V.5).&#13;
In 1970 -75 the GDP rates of growth are lower than&#13;
the CSO's NDMP rates of growth. This was a period of rapid&#13;
expansion in material production connected with a big investment&#13;
drive. It is logical to expect that in this situation non-material&#13;
services lagged behind the material production and the rates of&#13;
growth of GDP are, therefore, lower than those of NDMP.&#13;
In 1975 -80 there was a rapid decline in investment&#13;
and material production in 1979-80. Non-material services&#13;
declined but, as one could expect, they declined less rapidly&#13;
than material production. The rates of growth of GDP are,&#13;
therefore, higher than the rates of growth of NDMP.&#13;
For the whole 1970 -80 period the GDP rates of growth&#13;
are lower than the NDMP rate.&#13;
The GDP rates of growth seem to be consistent with the&#13;
official NDMP rates of growth. As the estimates of the value&#13;
of GDP in 1970, 1975 and 1980 heavily depend on official&#13;
statistics, the estimated rates of growth cannot be taken as&#13;
a verification of the official NDMP rates of growth. The rates&#13;
of growth of GNP at adjusted factor cost have been constructed&#13;
on the basis of adifferent methodology, which eliminates some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
price distortions. They are lower than our estimates of GDP&#13;
growth rates. Estimates of the rates of growth of GDP with&#13;
the NDMP values replaced by an NDMP minus taxes plus subsidies&#13;
in the socialist sector ( see Table III.10 ) gives unsatisfactory&#13;
results. The rate of growth of what should approximate GNP&#13;
at factor cost in 1970 -75 is even higher than the CSO's rate&#13;
of growth of NDMP. It is lower than the latter in 1975 - 80.&#13;
For the whole 1970 - 80 period it is approximately equal to&#13;
the NDMP rate of growth. In 1975 -80 it is lower than GNP at&#13;
adjusted factor cost estimated by L.W. International Financial&#13;
Research Inc., but it is considerably higher than the latter&#13;
in 1970 - 75 and in 1970 -80. However, no taxes on the private&#13;
sector were included and it is possible that statistics on&#13;
taxes and subsidies in the socialist sector are not fully&#13;
dependable. For these reasons these rates of growth should,&#13;
perhaps, be ignored.&#13;
The comparison of the CSO's rates of growth of NNMP&#13;
and the estimated rates of growth of GNP show the following&#13;
differences. In 1970 - 75 the rate of growth of material&#13;
consumption and, especially, investment, stimulated by an&#13;
excess of import over export, exceeded the rate of growth&#13;
of GNP. Not only non-material services are more sticky in&#13;
both production and consumption, but they are not augmented&#13;
by an excess of import over export, at least not to the same&#13;
extent as material goods.&#13;
In 1975 -80 there was a drastic reduction in invest-&#13;
ment which reduced, above all material production and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
import of goods. The NNMP rate of growth is, therefore, negative,&#13;
while the GNP rate, although small, is still positive. For the&#13;
whole period 1970 -80 the rate of growth of GNP,exceeds that&#13;
of NNMP because the former did not decline   as far as the&#13;
latter did in 1975 -80.&#13;
The estimated GDP and GNP rates of growth on the basis&#13;
of official statistics depend, of course, on the extend to which&#13;
these statistics are reliable and on various assumptions which&#13;
have been made to convert current into constant prices. They&#13;
are affected by various price distortions and by the extensive&#13;
use of indirect taxes and subsidies, as well as by any other&#13;
distortions which might have existed during the 1970's in&#13;
official statistics.&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
Poland: Comments on Rates of Exchange,&#13;
Per Capita GNP in U.S. Dollars, and Rates&#13;
of Growth of Real Per Capita GDP and GNP&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Without a detailed independent study the following comments can&#13;
only be accepted as impressionistic.   The per capita dollar value of&#13;
GNP in 1980 which is suggested as the most probable has no firm&#13;
foundation and it has been derived without reference to similar&#13;
estimates for other CPEs.   Rates of growth of real per capita GDP and&#13;
GNP are subject to the same qualifications as the estimates of GDP and&#13;
GNP in constant prices (Tables V.3 and V.4) resulting from doubts&#13;
about the validity of (1) assumptions on the basis of which the estimates&#13;
of GDP and GNP at current prices were constructed; and (2) official&#13;
price indices used to derive GDP and GNP at constant 1977 prices.    The&#13;
estimates here presented must, therefore, be used with great caution.&#13;
I.    Comments on PPP Used in the ICP and the Austria-Poland 1982&#13;
Comparative Study&#13;
The zloty to dollar rates of exchange in both the ICP and the&#13;
Austria-Poland 1982 comparative study seem to be downward biased.&#13;
This is caused by what appears to be an underestimation of the price of&#13;
consumption and investment goods.&#13;
The overall rates of exchange and the structure of rates of&#13;
ICP and the Austria-Poland 1982 study are compared with the CSO study&#13;
based on the France-Poland and an earlier Austria-Poland studies in&#13;
the following table:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
CSO    A-P (1982)    A-P (1982)      ICP&#13;
1974     1975(1)       1975(2)       1975&#13;
Consumption from personal&#13;
income                          17.6      18.9          15.9        13.2&#13;

Investment in machines and&#13;

Investment in construction        19.2&#13;
Total GNP                         20.6      18.3          17.3        14.3&#13;
(1) Remarks:&#13;
(a) A-P (1982) 1975(1) zloty/schilling rates converted into U.S.&#13;
dollars at the market exchange rate 18.51 schilling = $1.&#13;
(b) A-P (1982) 1975(2) zloty/schilling rates converted into U.S.&#13;
dollars at ICP's PPPs for component expenditures.&#13;
(c) CSO for 1974 - it is not clear how France-Poland and Austria-&#13;
Poland comparisons are converted into dollars.&#13;
(d) There may be some differences in definitions as to "consumption&#13;
from personal incomes" and "collective consumption" (CSO:&#13;
"consumption from personal income" and "consumption from&#13;
social funds"; A-P: "consumption of the population" and&#13;
"collective final consumption"; ICP: "consumption" and&#13;
"government").&#13;
(2) Possible reasons for understatement of PPP in consumption&#13;
(a) In Poland prices of basic foodstuffs were heavily subsidized&#13;
during the 1970's.    At the same time there were increasing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
shortages of these goods in socialist trade and a growing&#13;
proportion of foodstuffs were purchased outside socialist&#13;
trade.   Official statistics on the share of private trade&#13;
in foodstuffs are seriously underestimated.&#13;
Official price index shows that prices of consumption&#13;
goods and services purchased by the population increased to&#13;
157.1 in 1980 (the 1970 level = 100), food prices to 161.5,&#13;
food prices in socialist trade to 143.0, in restaurants, etc.&#13;
to 179.0 and in the market places to 280.7.    Most of these&#13;
increases occurred in 1975-80.&#13;
(b) A growing proportion of non-food consumption goods were&#13;
transacted outside socialist trade at higher prices.    This&#13;
tendency is shown in official statistics (the share of non-&#13;
socialist-sector 3.4% in 1970 and 11.7% in 1980), but the&#13;
extent of the trend is probably also underestimated.&#13;
(c) It is likely that all three studies underestimate consumption&#13;
prices in 1974 or 1975 for these reasons.&#13;
(d) The described tendency was further strengthened in 1975-80,&#13;
especially after 1978.&#13;
(3) The Structure of PPP&#13;
(a) The ratio of PPP in capital formation to PPP in consumption&#13;
from personal incomes and the ratio of PPP in collective&#13;
consumption to consumption from personal incomes are both&#13;
higher in the CSO study than in the two other studies.    The&#13;
ratios are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
CSO    A-P (1982)    A-P (1982)      ICP&#13;
1974     1975(1)       1975(2)       1975&#13;
Capital formation                %  J          103          159         149&#13;
Consumption from personal income&#13;
Collective consumption           %   89         53           70          86&#13;
Consumption from personal income&#13;
(b) The CSO PPP for 1974 is a weighted average of 40.1 for investment&#13;
in machines and equipment and 19.2 for investment in construction.&#13;
The proportion of construction in total capital formation&#13;
declined in 1975-80.   This change would tend to increase PPP&#13;
for total capital formation.&#13;
(c) The proportion of capital formation declined in NMP at domestic&#13;
constant prices from 36.7% in 1975 to 30.6% in 1978 and 19.3%&#13;
in 1980.   This tendency would tend to reduce the overall PPP&#13;
for GNP.&#13;
(d)  It can, perhaps, be assumed that CSO's study,based on comparisons&#13;
with two countries, better reflects disparities between PPP in&#13;
consumption, which is relatively easy to observe, and PPP in&#13;
capital formation and in collective consumption which are much&#13;
more difficult to assess by outside observers.    This argument&#13;
works against the ICP estimates for other prices than those&#13;
for consumption from personal incomes.&#13;
(e)  Accepting the CSO 1974 PPP ratios and the PPP values in&#13;
consumption from personal incomes as given in A-P and ICP, the&#13;
PPP for capital formation and collective formation would be as&#13;
follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
A-P (1)      A-P (2)       ICP&#13;
Capital formation                     34.0         28.6        23.8&#13;
Collective consumption                16.8         16.8        11.7&#13;
(f) Because of the appreciation of schilling in terms of U.S.&#13;
dollar from 18.51 schilling = $1 in 1975 to 13.37 schilling = $1&#13;
in 1978, which probably does not reflect relative changes in&#13;
purchasing power in the two countries, the PPP for 1978 expressed&#13;
in zloty/schilling cannot be converted at the new rate of&#13;
exchange.&#13;
II. Estimates of Per Capita GNP in U.S. Dollars in 1980.&#13;
(1) The rate of exchange for raw materials and fuels used for the&#13;
determination of producer prices&#13;
(a) A very thorough price revision took place in Poland in 1960.&#13;
Prices of producer goods were based on the rate of exchange&#13;
35-40 zloty = $1.   As wages increased in Poland during&#13;
1960-80 by about 13% more than in the U.S.A., according to&#13;
a Polish source (Gospodarka planowa, No. 4, 1982), hence&#13;
that source accepts the rate 40-45 zloty = $1 in 1980.    In&#13;
the first half of 1981 the corresponding rate was 50 zloty = $1&#13;
and it was accepted as the basis for the price revision which&#13;
was introduced as from January 1982.&#13;
(b) Dr. Zienkowski quoted 40-45 zloty = $1 as the rate of exchange&#13;
which was used by CSO for 1978.&#13;
(c)  According to another source in the Polish economic literature&#13;
45 zloty = $1 was used in 1980 but this zloty/dollar rate was&#13;
probably too high and 40 zloty = $1 would have been more&#13;
appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
(d) According to Gospodarka planowa, No. 4, 1982 the rate of&#13;
exchange for 1970 should be the same as for 1960.&#13;
(e) On the basis of the above rates per capita GNP in U.S. dollars&#13;
in 1970 and 1980 would be as follows:&#13;
Year     Rate of          GNP               GNP        Population    Per Capita&#13;
exchange     billion zloty      $ million                     GNP&#13;
1970     40zl./$l        921.9            23,048          32.5         709.2&#13;
1980     45zl./$l      2,583.9            57,420          35.6       1,612.9&#13;
1970     35zl./$1        921.9            26,340          32.5         810.5&#13;
1980     40zl./$l      2,583.9            64,598          35.6       1,814.6&#13;
(f) It is likely that the CSO will use 50zl./$l for their calculations&#13;
for 1981.   The rate of 45zl./$l for 1980 seems to give too low&#13;
per capita GNP.   However, the rate 40zl./$l is probably also too&#13;
high.   It is perhaps applicable to tradeables and does not&#13;
reflect prices for services and for non-tradeable goods.&#13;
(2) Cost of earnings of one dollar in export to capitalist countries.&#13;
(a)  This cost was 34.82 zloty = $1 in 1980.   If it were used as&#13;
the rate of exchange for 1980 per capita GNP would be as follows:&#13;
Year          Rate of          GNP             GNP         Per caita GNP&#13;
exchange     billion zloty     $ million           $&#13;
1980          34.8zl./$l     2,583.9          74,250         2,085.6&#13;
(b) Again, this rate of exchange would be applicable to tradeables&#13;
rather than to the whole GNP as it would not reflect prices&#13;
for services and non-tradeable goods which are likely to be&#13;
lower than those of tradeables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
(3) The special rate of exchange determined by the National Bank of&#13;
Poland.&#13;
(a) This rate is determined on the basis of a foreign exchange&#13;
balance in connection with non-trade transactions which&#13;
include currency exchanged by tourists, invisible transactions&#13;
and transfer payments from abroad, which in the case of Poland&#13;
represent a relatively large sum.   For this reason this zloty&#13;
into dollar rate may be artificially low.&#13;
(b) Per capita GNP in 1970 and 1980 converted at the special&#13;
rates would be as follows:&#13;
Year          Rate of            GNP                 GNP        Per Caita GN&#13;
exchange       billion zloty       $ million           $&#13;
1970           24.o0            921.9              38,413         1,181.9&#13;
1980           30.00          2,583.9              86,130         2,419.4&#13;
(4) The most probable rate - own choice&#13;
Taking the above rates into consideration, I would select the rate&#13;
not lower than the special rate 30.0 zloty = $1 and not higher than&#13;
34.8 zloty = $1.   For example, the rate 33 zloty = $1 would give the&#13;
following results which would seem probable:&#13;
Year         Rate of             GNP                 GNP        Per Caita-GN&#13;
exchange        billion zloty        $ million           x&#13;
1980           33.0            2,583.9             78,300         2,199.0&#13;
&#13;

III. Per Capita GDP and GNP and Rates of Growth&#13;
(a) Accepting the values of GDP and GNP at constant 1977 prices as&#13;
presented in tables V.3 and V.4 the corresponding per capita&#13;
estima:tes and the rates of growth are as follows:-&#13;
Year     Population       GDP(A)       Per Capita      GNP      Per Capita&#13;
million       billion       GDP(A)        billion      GNP&#13;
(June)        zloty        zloty          zloty     zloty&#13;
1970         32.5        1,292.0       39,753.8      1,218.3    37,256.9&#13;
1P75         34.0        1,936.4       56,952.9      2,021.5    59,455.9&#13;
1980         35.6        2,112.8       59,348.3      2,115.2    59,415.7&#13;
Rates of Growth (%)&#13;
1970-75       0.9          8.4            7.5          10.7        9.8&#13;
1975-80       0.9          1.8            0.8           0.9        0.0&#13;
1970-80       0.9          5.1            4.1           5.8        4.8&#13;
(b) Official price indices, which were used to estimate GDP and&#13;
GNP at constant prices, probably do not fully eliminate the&#13;
degree of inflation and the above rates of growth are,&#13;
therefore, likely upward biased.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The paper presents estimates of GDP,
            GNP, their components and rates of growth. These estimates
            are based on published statistics, information available in
            various published sources and some assumptions. The adjusted
            values of nonmaterial services are added to the values of
            material production as they appear in statistical yearbooks
            to obtain GDP at current prices. Similarly, the estimated
            values of expenditure on nonmaterial services are added to
            expenditures on consumption products, investment in fixed
            capital and changes in inventories to obtain GNP at current
            prices. The ratios of Net Domestic Material Product/GDP and
            Net National Material Product/GNP are found to be unstable.
            Comments on principles and methods of price formation,
            taxation, subsidization, price distortions, the official and
            special rates of exchange that were used during the
            1970's, the purchasing power rates and conversion
            coefficients are discussed. The rates of growth for 1970-75,
            1975-80 and 1970-80 are calculated for the GDP and GNP at
            constant prices estimates for 1970, 1975 and 1980.
