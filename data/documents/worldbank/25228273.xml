Innovation in Carbon Finance&#13;
The World Bank Institute is a global connector of knowledge, learning and innovation for development&#13;
and poverty reduction. WBI's Climate Change Practice focuses on four key programs: Leadership and&#13;
Coalition Building for Climate Change; Cities and Climate Change; Innovation in Carbon Finance; and&#13;
Climate Adaptation for Water, Agriculture, and Natural Resource Management. Brochures are available&#13;
for each of these components.&#13;

            The World Bank Institute (WBI) is a
            global connector of knowledge, learning, and innovation for
            development and poverty reduction. WBI’s climate change
            practice focuses on four key programs: leadership and

            change; innovation in carbon finance; and climate adaptation
            for water, agriculture, and natural resource management.
            Brochures are available for each of these components. In
            future, climate change mitigation will include domestic and
            international actions on the generation of tradable emission
            reduction credits. This will require adapting or creating
            new financial instruments. Strengthening local institutions
            can function as knowledge centers to more effectively
            disseminate learning programs.
