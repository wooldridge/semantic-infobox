Emergency Drought Recovery Project&#13;
Grant Summary&#13;
Recipient:             Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia&#13;
Implementation Agencies: Ministry of Rural Development, Food Security Department through&#13;
Regional and Woreda Governments.&#13;
Amount and Term:       IDA Grant of SDR 43.5 million (US$ 60 million equivalent)&#13;
Objectives and Description: To enable Government to help affected families survive the emergency,&#13;
retain productive assets, and develop sustainable livelihoods, and to&#13;
contribute to the stabilization of the macroeconomy. The project will: (i)&#13;
defend critical human development expenditure by Government during the&#13;
next year from the pressures caused by the current crisis; (ii) maintain the&#13;
availability of critical economic inputs (particularly those needed in rural&#13;
areas) and support the economic recovery process; (iii) rehabilitate and&#13;
create communal assets using community labour within the affected&#13;
population, and (iv) provide income supplements, and protect private&#13;
assets for the affected population. The main indicator of project impact&#13;
would be reduced levels of forced out-migration of affected families from&#13;
their homes.&#13;
Benefits:              (i) Food aid received from bilateral donors will be used more effectively to&#13;
assist the families affected by the drought, due to the existence of timely&#13;
and complementary cash inputs provided by the Bank, facilitating the&#13;
return to 'normal' sustainable livelihoods; (ii) the macro-economy will&#13;
remain stable, and Government will not have to divert resources from its&#13;
normal, long run efforts to create sustainable long term I ivelihoods for the&#13;
rural poor; and (iii) mechanisms will be tested which may eventually&#13;
evolve into the tools for providing safety net support to vulnerable -&#13;
Ethiopians under the SDPRP and will supplant ad hoc responses to crisis.&#13;
Risks:                 (i) Management capacity at woreda level and below is the key constraint to&#13;
reaching communities as planned. The project will use existing, simple,&#13;
systems to reach out to communities and improve the impact of programs;&#13;
and (ii) the dependence of rural communities in food insecure areas on&#13;
food aid may be deepened. To minimize this risk, the project seeks to use&#13;
the food aid more effectively to provide income, and create infrastructure,&#13;
which will support regeneration of productive assets and strengthening of&#13;
long term livelihoods.&#13;
Project Appraisal Document:  In accordance with OP 8.50 there is a Technical Annex and no PAD&#13;
Disbursement:          The grant is expected to be disbursed by December 31, 2006.&#13;

I. THE DROUGHT OF 2002 AND 2003&#13;
Background, circumstances of the drought and recent developments&#13;
1.    On December 7, 2002, the Prime Minister launched the Joint UN - Government Appeal to the&#13;
international community for assistance in averting a humanitarian crisis brought on by a gradually&#13;
deepening drought in the traditionally vulnerable areas of Ethiopia. The call went out following the&#13;
recommendations of a joint Government/Donor mission which spent the month of November assessing&#13;
the situation. The assessment confirmed concerns regarding the severe food insecurity suffered by an&#13;
already large group of 11.3 million persons due to the effect of climatic irregularities during 2002 on&#13;
the main agricultural harvests in the Center, Center-North and Center-East of the country. An&#13;
additional 3 million people could also face extreme food insecurity if the short rains, due in February&#13;
2003, fail..&#13;
2.     The crisis has been building since the short (belg) rains of February and March 2002 failed in&#13;
the North and Center of the country. This failure reduced cropped areas in drought prone parts of the&#13;
country, and it made it difficult for farmers to prepare adequately for the main season, as draught&#13;
animals were undernourished and soils too hard for the ploughs and tools available to smallholders.&#13;
The situation was made worse by a prolonged dry spell of up to six weeks between the short rains and&#13;
the main (meher) season, which affected 55 zones and special woredas (about 80 % of the country).&#13;
This delay in the start of the main season had the following effects': (i) it disturbed land preparation&#13;
routines; (ii) it delayed sowing dates; (iii) it reduced the sowing of heavier yielding, maize and sorghum&#13;
crops in favor of short cycle crops such as teff, and pulses, normally planted later in the season; and (iv)&#13;
it deterred fanners from investing in (higher risk) inputs to raise yields, such as fertilizer and improved&#13;
seed. As a result, fertilizer use dropped 17 percent from the previous year, and use of improved seed&#13;
dropped by 70 percent. Fertilizer use was further constrained by the higher than normal default on prior&#13;
season loans -- where a bumper crop kept crop prices low and constrained loan repayment.&#13;
3.     A subset of 31 zones and special woredas (about 44 percent of the country and some of the&#13;
traditionally food surplus woredas) suffered from unevenly distributed and unseasonably light rains.&#13;
This resulted in (i) the need to replant, reducing crop density; and (ii) reduced seed set and grain fill.&#13;
These effects reduced grain yields by 20-30 percent in areas which are usually surplus, and which show&#13;
up as planted and producing (registering as green on the satellite imagery).&#13;
4.     Should the moisture irregularities and shortages continue during the next short (belg) season in&#13;
February and March of 2003, an additional 3 million persons, currently on the margin of personal food&#13;
self- sufficiency, will need immediate humanitarian attention.&#13;
The Affected Areas and Populations&#13;
5.     The areas most affected by the drought are Afar region, northern Somali region, eastern&#13;
Oromiya region, the lowlands along the Rift valley in the Arsi and East Shewa lowlands, stretching&#13;
south into Wolayita and the Sidamo lowlands, and further south to Arba Minch. Eastern and Southern&#13;
Tigray and Eastern Amhara are also badly affected (see Map). Estimates of the affected population by&#13;
region are provided in the Map at the end of this report. The effects are most marked in the livestock&#13;
areas, where the lack of moisture has been most severe. According to the nutrilional surveys, the&#13;
'From the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission to Ethiopia - 30 December - 2002 -- p. 2.&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
coping possibilities for the population in these areas have been exhausted. Malnutrition and wastage&#13;
rates are high. Survival is the issue. Nutritional surveys in some of the affected areas show that&#13;
malnutrition is already in excess of a Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate of 10 percent -- a critical&#13;
level which usually triggers an emergency relief response. According to WHO/UNICEF standards, a&#13;
GAM rate of above 10 percent is considered serious and above 20 percent as of crisis proportions.&#13;
6.     The food security situation of pastoralists in northeastern parts of the country has&#13;
exhibited particularly rapid deterioration. A nutrition survey conducted in Afar Region Zone 1&#13;
revealed a GAM rate of 32 percent in July 2002. In August 2002 another survey conducted in&#13;
Zone 3 of Afar Region showed a GAM score of 18 percent. A joint Government/NGO survey in&#13;
the lowlands of East and West Hararghe in September 2002 estimated a GAM rate of 15 percent.&#13;
Similarly, Fik Zone of Somali Region (bordering lowland East Hararghe) demonstrated a GAM&#13;
rate of 21 percent. Since then, conditions have slightly improved in some areas due to food aid&#13;
distribution between August and November.&#13;
7.     Other areas where malnutrition has reached unacceptable levels include the northeastern&#13;
lowland escarpment bordering Afar Region and the lowlands of the Rift Valley. In East Tigray,&#13;
nutrition surveys in September 2002 showed an 11 percent GAM. This is twice as high as 2001 (6&#13;
percent) and 2000 (5 percent) levels, and demonstrates a situation which has been worsening since&#13;
early September. East in the lowland gorges of North Gonder, malnutrition rates have reached 18&#13;
percent GAM. Further south in South Wello (Amhara Region), a survey conducted in August 2002&#13;
showed GAM rates of 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively and 13 percent GAM rate in south&#13;
of South Wello in Oromiya Zone.&#13;
8.     The nutritional status in SNNPR was in the acceptable range during the first half of 2002&#13;
with values ranging from a GAM rate of 2 percent to 8 percent. However, following poor Belg&#13;
production, a further survey in September showed that the situation was already deteriorating with&#13;
an estimated 10 percent GAM in Badawacho and Soro districts (Hadiya Zone).&#13;
9.     The ultimate response to hardship is migration in search of an improved livelihood. A&#13;
UN/EUE report of November 2002 indicated that some 35,000 people migrated from drought&#13;
affected areas in East and West Hararghe and Arssi, where food distribution had been delayed, to&#13;
the highland, high potential Bale zone in search of new cultivable areas and moisture.&#13;
Production Estimates and Food Requirements&#13;
10.   Grain production has been affected by the factors noted above. Cereal and pulse production&#13;
for the crop year 2002/03 has been forecast at 9.27 million tons (which includes a normal short season&#13;
harvest of 350,000 tons in early calendar 2003). This harvest level is about 25 percent below last&#13;
year's harvest, and 21 percent below the five year average. The overall area planted to grains was&#13;
about 11.3 million ha, about the same levels as previous years. However, there was a shift out of long-&#13;
cycle grains such as maize, sorghum and finger millet, and into shorter cycle crops such as teff and&#13;
pulses -- due to the fears of a short season set off by the late arrival of the main season rains. The&#13;
factors affecting yields have been noted above. These effects are more marked in the drought prone&#13;
areas of the Center and Center-North and Center-East of the country (see Maps).&#13;
11.   Coffee production in 2002/03, which contributes over 70% to total exports, is expected to be&#13;
lower than the previous year, due the reduced rains at and after flowering, and biennial production&#13;
patterns. Incentives for treatment and care of coffee have deteriorated over the past few years, with the&#13;
drop in world coffee prices, which will also affect yields. The drop in coffee production will mean a&#13;
reduction in cash available at the household level which could be critical for families in the coffee&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
growing areas affected by drought, in West Hararghe and Harari. Chat production, does not seem to&#13;
have been affected. Overall, families in affected areas have reduced cash incomes with which to cope&#13;
with the drought.&#13;
Livestock&#13;
12.    The Ethiopian smallholder production systems rely heavily on a livestock as a source of&#13;
food, cash and draught power. In highland farms, which represent most of the more densely&#13;
inhabited parts of the country, production systems rely on both crops and livestock. In the lowland&#13;
areas, there is an almost complete reliance on animal based systems. These pastoralist systems are&#13;
located in the extensive grazing areas in the Eastern, Western and Southern Lowlands of the&#13;
country. The boundary between mixed farming systems, and livestock based systems is shown in&#13;
Map 1.&#13;
13.    The pastoralist areas in the lowland areas of the North, the Center-North and Center- East&#13;
and have been the hardest hit by the current drought. In the third and fourth quarters of 2002,&#13;
reported losses of livestock in the pastoralist areas of Afar, in north Somali, and other lowland&#13;
areas (in Amhara, Oromiya and SNNPR) prompted interventions from the Government, NGOs&#13;
and international agencies. The assistance was designed partly to boost disease resistance of&#13;
livestock, through provision of vaccines and drugs and partly to ameliorate water and forage&#13;
shortages through negotiated access to better resources. At the same time, food aid programs for&#13;
the affected communities were reinforced, supplementing programs established two years before&#13;
when four consecutive years of BeIg rain failure had dramatically reduced livestock numbers and&#13;
incomes.&#13;
Agricultural Markets and Prices&#13;
14.    The domestic grain markets in Ethiopia function through a network of small, traders who&#13;
buy surpluses from small farmers and sell in the nearby markets at relatively small margins. These&#13;
markets function in relative isolation. Margins between markets in grain surplus areas and those&#13;
in deficit areas are high -- above the level one would expect in other countries in Africa. Small&#13;
grain producers as well as small traders are not well informed about grain availability and prices.&#13;
Larger grain movements from surplus to deficit areas are constrained by high transport costs due&#13;
to poor road infrastructure, weak market information systems, costly bag-based grain logistical&#13;
management, imperfect grading and standards, and a quasi monopoly in the transportation sector.&#13;
15.    Grain prices in surplus producing regions have been severely depressed for almost two&#13;
years, through mid-2002. These depressed prices were a function of higher than average harvests&#13;
in two consecutive years in the absence of effective price stabilization measures at the national&#13;
level. In response, some of the donor agencies and Government purchased part of the grain for&#13;
food assistance from the local markets instead of importing it. In 2001 and 2002 about 160 000&#13;
tons of grain each year were locally purchased by international agencies and distributed as food&#13;
aid.&#13;
16.    The grain market prices began to increase sharply during the latter half of 2002 when it&#13;
became apparent that cereal production would be substantially lower for both Belg and Meher&#13;
crops. Between October 2001 and October 2002, the nominal average price of maize increased by&#13;
85 percent, wheat 50 percent, barley 32 percent, and sorghum 25 percent. Figure 1 shows the&#13;
average monthly price for teff, wheat and maize in the Addis Ababa market. The price movement&#13;
trends observed in this market is similar to other markets in Bahr Dar, Mekele, Hossana,&#13;
DireDawa, and Nazrethe. Certain segments of the population, includirg urban households with&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
fixed incomes, nomadic populations and about 20 percent of the rural population who purchase&#13;
grain from the market will be negatively affected by the increased grain prices.&#13;

17.    Up to 50 percent declines in livestock prices were reported in all markets except in the&#13;
south-west zones, and more generally, for high-quality butchers' stock. The fall in prices reflects&#13;
increased market presentations and few buyers in most areas. In many rural markets it seems that&#13;
more arrivals are being taken back home by the would-be sellers than are currently being sold at&#13;
the already reduced prices. Prices are set to decline even further. What is clear is that if the Belg&#13;
rains of early calendar 2003 are not forthcoming the situation will deteriorate rapidly and more&#13;
losses are likely to occur.&#13;
Macroeconomic Impact&#13;
18.    As a result of the assessments and events described above, Government has revised the&#13;
forecasts for economic performance contained in the recently issued SDPRP2 , as noted in the table&#13;
below:&#13;

GDP at market prices       US$ 6.4 billion       US$ 6.2 billion       3% lower&#13;
19.    As can be noted above, the GDP growth rate is halved, and the projected inflation rate&#13;
rises by a third. Importantly, there is a sharp negative effect on the trade balance and on the&#13;
budget, due to the sharp increase in spending, in part on imports, which is foreseen as the&#13;
Government takes measures to respond to the drought. The impact on crop production and&#13;
livestock has been noted above. Whereas a large amount of assistance has been pledged in&#13;
support to Ethiopia, most of it is in the form of food aid or materials, with few donors able to&#13;
provide large amounts of money at short notice, to be used in financing the foreign exchange&#13;
needs of the response.&#13;
I. THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE&#13;
The Framework for Addressing Vulnerability&#13;
Vulnerability to Climate Shock in Ethiopia&#13;
20.    The SDPRP indicates that 45 percent of the population lives on consumption levels that are&#13;
below the poverty line. It is important to note however, that there are between 3 and 6 million people in&#13;
Ethiopia who suffer from chronic food insecurity, and are at risk of starvation every year. The number&#13;
of people who are chronically food insecure appears to be increasing. It is likely that most of these&#13;
people live in the "drought prone" woredas (districts) identified by the Government. However,&#13;
according to the Poverty Profile (2000), substantial numbers of chronically food insecure households do&#13;
live even in the food secure woredas, requiring a nation-wide approach to the chronic food insecurity&#13;
problem in the medium term. Studies indicate that vulnerability to clinmatic shock is cumulative.&#13;
Recovery from any given event is slow, and often not complete, as the family may have had to sell&#13;
animals and other assets in order to survive -- assets which are hard to r ecuperate in light of the very&#13;
low consumption and savings levels such families face even in good years. A recent study of&#13;
destitution in the three regions of North Wello, South Wello and Wag H-amra defined destitution as "a&#13;
state of extreme poverty that results from the pursuit of 'unsustainable livelihoods', meaning that a&#13;
series of livelihood shocks and/or negative trends or processes erodes the asset base of already poor and&#13;
vulnerable households until they are no longer able to meet their minimum subsistence needs. They&#13;
lack access to the key productive assets needed to escape from poverty, and they be-come dependent on&#13;

21.    A drought such as the one underway will require assistance to prevent precipitous shortfalls in&#13;
the food consumption of the chronically food insecure households in the affected woredas. In addition,&#13;
it will also drive the marginally poor families (who would otherwise have improved their position in a&#13;
normal year) to consume their assets in order to maintain current consumption levels, thus eroding their&#13;
already limited ability to cope with future weather shocks. Therefore, the appropriate government&#13;
response to the current crisis should not only seek to redress the chronic food insecurity of extremely&#13;
poor households in the food insecure woredas, but also reach out to the other marginal poor families&#13;
elsewhere in the country so as to retain their assets and sustain livelihoods.&#13;
The Policy Framework&#13;
22.    Devastating recurrent droughts have been and will be the major development challenges of&#13;
Ethiopia. Development strategies and policies of the country are geared towards alleviating the socio-&#13;
economic impact of drought, ensuring food security and creating sustainable livelihoods for the poor.&#13;
The government has been taking a number of basic measures to effectively address the problems of&#13;
poverty and famine in the medium and long-term through multi-faceted and coordinated efforts. In this&#13;
regard the basic framework is provided by Ethiopia's poverty reduction strategy paper, the Sustainable&#13;
Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP), which includes the Agricultural Development&#13;
Led Industrialization (ADLI) strategy, the National Policy on Disaster Prevention and Management&#13;
(NPDPM) and the National Food Security Strategy.&#13;
23.    The SDPRP was issued in July 2002 and indicates that about 45 percent of the population falls&#13;
below the poverty line. The program calls for growth rates of at least 7 percent per annum over the next&#13;
5 years to reduce poverty rate by 10 percent. The SDPRP is built on four pillars: (i) Agricultural&#13;
Development-led Industrialization (ADLI) and food security which recognizes firstly that market&#13;
based agriculture is the engine of growth supplying domestic and international markets. It notes&#13;
secondly that agriculture will require increasing technical progress, output diversification, and greater&#13;
market interaction. Thirdly, industry and services need to grow in conjunction with the expansion of&#13;
agriculture. Finally, there is a need for the development of a comprehensive food security and safety&#13;
net strategy. (ii) Governance, Decentralization, and Empowerment through increased participation&#13;
and consultation of the public in policy-making by decentralizing decision making authority; and&#13;
empowering woredas (districts) as the center of socio-economic development; (iii) Reform of the&#13;
Justice System and the Civil Service and (iv) Capacity Building for the public and private sector,&#13;
including farmers, to support ADLI, reform of the judiciary and civil service, and decentralization and&#13;
empowerment.&#13;
24.    The Policy on Disaster Prevention and Management (PDPM) was issued in 1993 as part of&#13;
the government's efforts to address the root causes of the prevailing vulnerabilities to drought and&#13;
famine. PDPM discourages free hand-outs of relief supplies to able bodied people. The underlying&#13;
principles and objectives of PDPM include: (i) no human life shall perish for want of food in time of&#13;
disaster, (ii) the quality of life in the affected areas shall be protected from deterioration on account of&#13;
disaster and the adverse impact is mitigated on a timely manner, (iii) the assets and economic fabric of&#13;
the affected areas shall be preserved and best use of the natural resources of the areas shall be promoted&#13;
to enable speedy post disaster recovery, and (iv) provision of relief shall not hurt human dignity,&#13;
reinforce the capabilities of the affected areas and contribute to growth and development. In addition to&#13;
tackling the issue of dependency for relief assistance, this policy seeks to integrate relief resources with&#13;
development initiatives. A general guideline to this effect was issued in 1995 (which precedes&#13;
decentralization).&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25.    Under PDPM the preconditions for a disaster declaration are defined, and guidance is provided&#13;
on the declaration of disasters, and on how to manage the response. In addition, under the policy, an&#13;
early warning system and a relief response logistical system is put in place to respond to a crisis. Under&#13;
its mechanisms for responding to crisis, the PDPM lays emphasis on measures such as Employment&#13;
Generation Schemes (EGS) which are to be planned in advance, to provide employment to able-bodied&#13;
disaster victims. This approach seeks to generate effective resource utilization and reduce relief&#13;
dependence by (a) providing a means of income (in cash or in kind) to the most affected people in&#13;
disaster-affected areas, (b) building up the assets of affected areas in order to improve their resilience to&#13;
disaster, (c) creating conditions for eliminating the root causes of disasters and build up the&#13;
infrastructure for future development, and (d) reinforcing work ethics of the affected population.&#13;
Gratuitous Relief is provided to affected persons such as the aged, the very young, pregnant and&#13;
lactating women, who cannot participate in EGS activities due to physical limitations. It is restricted to&#13;
rural areas. There is no relief operation by DPPC for urban areas. In addition the P'DPM provides for&#13;
the management of a National Early Warning System, relief related warehousing services, the&#13;
establishment of a National Food Security Reserve, a National Disaster Prevention and Preparedness&#13;
Fund, a transport fleet for coverage where commercial fleets refuse to go, and measures for donor&#13;
coordination.&#13;
26.   In the context of the ongoing decentralization, improving the management and implementation&#13;
capacity at all levels will be critical. For one thing, the Government has to step up its effort to&#13;
strengthen implementation capacity at all levels, including especially the mechanisms of financing&#13;
flows and implementation modalities. For another, woreda-level authorities need to transmit signals to&#13;
the federal government on the evolving situation in the woredas in crisis situations such as the current&#13;
drought. Procedures need to be in place for monitoring the agreed roles and responsibilities so as to&#13;
quickly detect policy/implementation failures and put in place remedial measures, thus improving&#13;
accountability at all levels&#13;
Assisting the Chronically Food Insecure.&#13;
27.    As noted previously, calendar 2002 started with the need to care for an estimated 4.6 million&#13;
people, in spite of the excellent harvest in most parts of the country. As has been the procedure to date,&#13;
these needs were supplied under a relief program, and Government, U N agencies and donors continued&#13;
to: (i) provide food aid to severely affected households, (ii) distribute seeds and other agricultural&#13;
inputs, (iii) construct, rehabilitate and sink boreholes in drought affected areas through donor assisted&#13;
schemes, and (iv) provide nutritional supplementary foods and health care services. In addition to&#13;
these relief efforts, new programs were initiated designed to respond to the long term needs of these&#13;
populations, and create new sustainable livelihoods, rebuild their asset base, and generate the ability to&#13;
engage in sustainable livelihoods over the long term. The USAID funded Relief to Development&#13;
program in selected woredas in Amhara region is one such effort. A World Bank funded Food Security&#13;
Project (P050383, Credit 36460), targeting 12 drought prone food insecure woredas (in its first year)&#13;
and 60 woredas at full development, has also been initiated. Under this project funding would be&#13;
provided to communities in food insecure woredas in 4 highland regions to develop sustainable,&#13;
diversified livelihoods; local Government would be strengthened and initiatives would be taken to&#13;
improve food market efficiency, A Pastoral Communities Development Project (P 075915) is under&#13;
preparation with support from the World Bank, which would focus poverty reduction in pastoral&#13;
communities in lowland regions. In addition, most of the Birr 100 million allocation by the Federal&#13;
Government in FY 2002 to support the Food Security Program is being used to provide a long term&#13;
solution to drought related problems through investments in water harvesting structures, small scale&#13;
irrigation works and other infrastructure.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Assisting the Acutely Food Insecure.&#13;
28.    Triggered by the delayed onset of the meher rains the Government responded quickly by&#13;
purchasing 45,000 mt of cereals and 300 mt of famix from the local market. It also provided Birr 13.11&#13;
million to affected Regions for the purchase of seeds to initiate replanting of early maturing crops. In&#13;
addition, the Government supplied Birr 3 million worth of veterinary drugs, Birr 2.8 million worth of&#13;
21 medical kits, and made available four water tankers. As the situation worsened, the Governrent&#13;
issued a special alert in July 2002 that requested additional relief food, raising the January 2002&#13;
estimate by about 37 percent. Once the extent of the crisis became clear in early December, the issue&#13;
has been given a wider media coverage and high level government officials, including the Prime&#13;
Minister and his Cabinet, have visited the most affected areas in Eastern part of the country. In&#13;
response to the seriousness of the crisis, various sectors of civil society (traders, students, teachers,&#13;
religious sects, the military, civil servants) have contributed generously to assist the drought victims.&#13;
29.    The larger group of people who require international assistance under the current appeal will&#13;
include those who are chronically food insecure, many of whom are destitute, as well as another group&#13;
who live in areas vulnerable to drought climatic shock, and have slipped into food in security this year,&#13;
due to the climatic events described previously. The food aid requirement for calendar 2002 was&#13;
estimated at about 557,000 tons in January 2002 -- a level similar to that requested, and used, in the&#13;
previous year. By the end of calendar 2002 the estimate of needs had risen to some 897,000 tons (see&#13;
Table ). During the year, some 580,000 tons of food, well above the January estimate of needs, had&#13;
been received and distributed.&#13;
The Joint Government-UN Appeal for Emergency Assistance&#13;
30.    As noted previously, on December 7, 2002, the Prime Minister launched the Joint UN -&#13;
Government Appeal to the international community for assistance in averting a humanitarian crisis&#13;
brought on by a gradually deepening drought in the traditionally vulnerable areas of Ethiopia.&#13;
Based on the assessment of the impact of the reductions in crop and livestock production noted&#13;
above, the Government and UN have provided the following assessment of the affected population&#13;
currently needing relief.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31.    A strong caveat is made regarding the quality of the early (belg) rains in February of 2003. If&#13;
these fail, then the population needing relief will increase by over 30 percent. It should also be noted&#13;
that the beneficiary number for Sekota Woreda in Wag Hamra and Guba Lafto woreda in North Wello&#13;
Zones of Amhara region is not included in the above estimate. The total number of population needing&#13;
food assistance in these woredas is estimated to be 78,800 and 41,100, and their food requirement as of&#13;
January 2003 is 10,582 Mt And 4,466 Mt respectively. The USAID R21) program will cover these&#13;
woredas.&#13;
FoodAid&#13;
32.    As noted above, domestic production in 2002/03 is estimated at about 9.3 million tons.&#13;
Consumption requirements are in the order of 10.4 million tons6, when added to non-food needs of 1.6&#13;
million tons to cover seeds losses take, total requirements for the crop year to some 12 million tons.&#13;
This will have to be covered by a drawdown of stocks (estimated at 0.5 million tons at the start of the&#13;
season), commercial food imports and current pledges, and new pledges for food aid of the order of&#13;
1.44 million tons. Should the pledges be insufficient, the Government will be forced to finance&#13;
importation of food for relief. A rough food balance chart is provided below.&#13;

33.    The net additional requirement is well above any of the amounts delivered over the past seven&#13;
years. Indeed, the year when needs ran at almost the current levels was the year 2000. Then, the&#13;
estimated requirement at midyear (July) stood at 1.3 million tons, against actual deliveries of almost 1&#13;
million tons by year end.&#13;

34.    As has been the case in the past, the donors have responded generously to the appeal, and have&#13;
done their best to increase the food aid delivered in response to the gradually increasing estimates of&#13;
requirements. A Special Alert in July raised the estimate of needs some 37% over the January estimate,&#13;
and in October, the estimate of need was raised yet again. As noted above, in spite of the lead times&#13;
needed to respond to the significant volumes required by Ethiopia, the actual deliveries of food aid were&#13;
actually above the January needs estimate. Normally actual deliveries are 25 percent below the initial&#13;
needs estimate.&#13;
Non-food emergency assistance&#13;
35.    Non-food assistance provides an essential complement to interventions in food aid, health and&#13;
nutrition, and begins to set the stage for recovery from the shock, by assisting in such areas as water&#13;
supply, provision of agricultural inputs, early warning and capacity building. In August, a "Situation&#13;
Update and Joint Flash Appeal" was issued by the Government and the UN, which requested a further&#13;
US $12 million to cover items such as those mentioned above, as well as shelter, HIV/AIDS awareness&#13;
and co-ordination costs. Government contributions included US $1.6 million for emergency seeds and&#13;
US $340,000 for veterinary drugs. The donor response has been encouraging and non-food relief&#13;
assistance of US $22.5 million has been pledged. The areas of intervention include water and sanitation&#13;
(US $6 million), health and nutrition (US $10 million), agriculture and livestock (US $3.7 million) and&#13;
capacity building (US $2.8 million). In addition, there are unspecified contributions in the range of US&#13;
$9.13 million that are for a variety of interrelated and crosscutting activities that cannot be attributed to&#13;
specific sectors.&#13;
36.   In addition to the need for food, the appeal asks for assistance with a range of non-food items&#13;
noted below, totaling US$ 76.2 million.&#13;

37.       The overall shock to the economy (the cost of responding to the crisis and generating an&#13;
economic recovery) is in the order of US$ 330 million, about 5 percent of GDP and about 80 percent of&#13;
exports. Of this, US$ 76 million dollars represents the impact on non-food requirements, and some US&#13;
$ 250 million represents the value of the additional I million tons of food needed to respond to the&#13;
current crisis (over and above normal food aid receipts of 460,000 tons received in the average year --&#13;
see table above).&#13;
The Government's Request to the Bankfor an Emergency Drought Recovery Program&#13;
38.       The Government has requested the Bank for support in addressing the social and economic&#13;
problems caused by the drought. The request is set forth in a document called the Emergency Drought&#13;
,Recovery Program of January 2003. This program requests a one traniche disbursement of about US$&#13;
75 million to stabilize macroeconomic expectations and indicators. The counterpart resources&#13;
generated from the operation would then be used to carry out a series of employment creation, and&#13;
infrastructure development projects at the village level. Funding would be made available to the&#13;
woredas via the decentralized fiscal woreda grant system. Coordination of the program would be&#13;
located in the offices of the Food Security Department of the Ministry of Rural Development.&#13;

III. THE BANK RESPONSE&#13;
The Country Assistance Strategy and Vulnerability&#13;
39.    The Bank's CAS for Ethiopia seeks to support the Government's SDPRP under a program with&#13;
three pillars:&#13;
1.     Enhance pro-poor growth, both urban and rural, through:&#13;
Accelerating rural growth by supporting increased rural productivity (effective&#13;
technological transfers and skills, the marketization of agriculture, and the provision&#13;
of more effective infrastructure and infrastructure services in transport, energy and&#13;
water);&#13;
*       Major stress on urban growth by improving the investment climate, generating off-&#13;
farm employment as well as to build labor-augmenting modern sectors of the&#13;
economy;&#13;
*       Support to the development of financial markets (commercial banks, rural finance,&#13;
long term and equity finance);&#13;
*       Rapid export growth through production of high value agricultural products and&#13;
increased support to export oriented manufacturing sectors; and&#13;
*       A stable macro-framework and sound regulatory reforms.&#13;
2.     Enhance human development outcomes by improving governance:&#13;
*       Supporting the reform of the public sector systems through civil service reform&#13;
(including financial management and justice system reforms) and capacity building&#13;
that also effectively mainstream gender considerations;&#13;
*       Deepening and strengthening decentralization to shift decision making closer to the&#13;
grass roots;&#13;
*       Empowering civil society to enhance the responsiveness and accountability of the&#13;
public sector.&#13;
*       Improving delivery of education services in terms of coverage, quality and equity;&#13;
*       Expand coverage and quality of all health services, especially preventive health care,&#13;
including nutrition and WV/AIDS prevention;&#13;
*       Improve access to clean water supply and sanitation.&#13;
3. Reduce vulnerability by:&#13;
*       Reforming food aid delivery and other safety net programs to very poor households&#13;
in ways that enable them to sustain human development and other assets through the&#13;
system of inter-governmental fiscal transfers, better monitoring, surveillance and&#13;
early warning, as well as increased cost-effectiveness of safety net programs;&#13;
*       Assisting Ethiopia better manage the vulnerability of the economy to terms of trade&#13;
shocks through crop diversification and better functioning commodity and inputs&#13;
markets;&#13;
*       Assisting the vulnerable to accumulate assets through expanded access to savings&#13;
services and other simple financial instruments;&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
*       Mitigating and reducing risks in vulnerable areas by improving agricultural&#13;
productivity, adapting better water management practices including irrigation, and&#13;
encouraging off-farm activities and labor mobility;&#13;
*       Enhancing programs to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and reduce the impact of&#13;
AIDS-related morbidity and mortality;&#13;
*       Increased attention to environmental issues, such as land and natural resource&#13;
degradation, and;&#13;
*       Improving the provision of short to medium term interventions that address the&#13;
immediate concerns of vulnerable groups such as poor women (e.g expansion of&#13;
literacy/numeracy programs, safety nets including incorne-generating programs).&#13;
40.    Action to reduce vulnerability, and provide long term solutions to the creation of sustainable&#13;
employment in rural areas, particularly those that are most vulnerable to climatic shock, is strongly&#13;
supported by the CAS. This project rests firmly on a key CAS pillar -- vulnerability reduction -- and&#13;
will contribute to stabilization of the macroeconomy, the defence of human development expenditure,&#13;
and direct action in the communities of families affected by the drought, with measures which seek to&#13;
re-establish sustainable livelihoods and prevent forced migration.&#13;
Prior Bank Emergency Response and Lessons Learned&#13;
41.    Lessons learned from previous emergency operations have been taken into account in the&#13;
design of the project, and the project preparation/appraisal has benefited from the advice of teams&#13;
involved in responding to similar emergencies in other countries.&#13;
42.    The Bank has responded with dedicated operations to the drought of 1974 and the drought of&#13;
1984. The first of these two operations, for US$ 10 million (Credit 485-ET) went to the Board in June&#13;
1974. It was directed towards the regions of Tigray and Wollo, and included a range of components&#13;
designed to improve rural infrastructure, to enable affected families to recover from the emergency.&#13;
Assistance for drought management and coordination was also provided. The OED ]'roject&#13;
Performance Audit Report noted that while the infrastructure components were carried out reasonably&#13;
effectively, in spite of high staff turnover, civil strife and conflict with Somalia, the project failed to&#13;
reach the expected outcomes, and to provide recommendations on how drought prone regions should be&#13;
developed. The Sirinka Pilot Settlement Project, funded under the project, was to have provided a basis&#13;
for this policy, but lessons learned had not been incorporated into Government policy as of 1985.&#13;
43.    The second operation, the Drought Recovery Program for US$ 30 million was approved by the&#13;
Board in April 1985. The project funded importation of fertilizer and other agricultural inputs (about&#13;
half the Bank resources), transport equipment (a third of Bank resources) and water supply&#13;
rehabilitation (the remainder). Objectives were to support economic recovery for the 6-10 million&#13;
people affected by drought in Tigray, Wello, Eritrea, Gonder and Sidamo, while minimizing the&#13;
negative effects on the ongoing development program and the macro-economy. Coordination was out&#13;
of a Technical Support Unit in the Ministry of Agriculture. Implementation was satisfactory, although&#13;
the OED audit notes that "...even under emergency conditions, project linanced inputs should not be&#13;
distributed free of charge... the projects economic benefits would be enhanced if some communal&#13;
works... were to be requested from the beneficiaries...".&#13;
44.   Key lessons drawn from a Bankwide review of emergency operations follow:&#13;
Including measures to enhance government's capacity to monitor food security and detect&#13;
impending harvest shortfalls, plan effectively to mitigate their impact, and efficiently manage&#13;
actions for recovery is very important. The project will assess whether there is need to&#13;
strengthen the government's early warning system and to improve its capacity to mitigate and&#13;
respond to emergencies.&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* Emergency operations must be simple, rapidly executable, and not burdened with&#13;
conditionality. This project will be kept simple, using existing Government implementation&#13;
channels to the extent possible, supporting activities that are already underway and funding&#13;
importation of key commodities. It includes no policy-oriented conditionalities.&#13;
*  Interventions shouldfocus on meeting the needs of the most vulnerable groups in society. This&#13;
project will support the government's safety net programs.&#13;
*  The operation shouldfocus on sectors immediately affected, and not undertake too broad an&#13;
agenda of cross-cutting issues. This project is narrow in scope, focusing on affected areas, and&#13;
funding critical imports and government initiatives that are already underway.&#13;
*  Commitment and ownership of the borrower are criticalfor successful implementation. This&#13;
project responds to the government's direct appeal to the Bank for aid (see Schedule A) and fits&#13;
into their Emergency Drought Recovery Program.&#13;
* Speed in preparation, appraisal, and implementation are critical elements of success. The&#13;
request for the response is dated November 27, 2002. Preparation of this project started&#13;
December, 2002 and the preparation/appraisal mission is scheduled for January 2003. The&#13;
target is to have the project to the Board before the end of March, 2003.&#13;
45.    Action to reduce vulnerability, and provide long term solutions to the creation of sustainable&#13;
employment in rural areas, particularly those that are most vulnerable to climatic shock, is strongly&#13;
supported by the CAS. This project rests firmly on a key CAS pillar -- vulnerability reduction -- and&#13;
will contribute to stabilization of the macroeconomy, the defence of human development expenditure,&#13;
and direct action in the communities of families affected by the drought, with measures which seek to&#13;
re-establish sustainable livelihoods and prevent forced migration&#13;
Alternative Response Mechanisms Considered&#13;
Reallocation and Reorientation of Existing Operations&#13;
46.    The Bank has two operations underway at present in Ethiopia that offer potential opportunities&#13;
for reorientation and a rapid response to the emergency. These are the Food Security Project (P050383)&#13;
where a credit of US$ 85 million was approved in 2002, and the Social Rehabilitation and&#13;
Development Fund Project (ESRDF I P000771) where a credit of US$ 120 million and a supplemental&#13;
credit of US $28.3 million were approved in 1996 and 2002. The impact on the Government's&#13;
economic development program of redirecting these existing operations was assessed, and it was agreed&#13;
that the reorientation of these operations would be too disruptive. Rather, it was noted that the Food&#13;
Security Project is building a carefully structured long term platform for addressing vulnerability issues&#13;
in drought prone areas of the country. Disrupting this process would be a setback for the&#13;
implementation of exactly the kind of program needed to prevent the depth of the current emergency.&#13;
The Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund Project on the other hand, is due to close in early&#13;
2003, and has limited resources available with which to respond to emergency needs. Rather, it is&#13;
proposed to draw on the institutional structure created in this 'social fund' experience, to support the&#13;
woreda based programs planned for the proposed Emergency Drought Recovery Project.&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Speed up the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit&#13;
47.    The Bank is engaged with Government and donors in designing a broad, quick disbursing&#13;
PRSC operation to support the implementation of the SDPRP. This operation will also focus on a&#13;
response to vulnerability concerns, in addition to its economic growth and empowerrnent agenda. Under&#13;
the vulnerability component, the program team is designing interventions which include safety nets and&#13;
other community assistance and transfer mechanisms, under the framework of decentralized fiscal&#13;
management and a strengthened Woreda government. The Emergency Drought Recovery Project will&#13;
draw on the design work initiated under the PRSC, and put in place initial institutional mechanisms&#13;
based on decentralized Govemment (with considerable technical assistance) to provide a response to&#13;
communities in affected areas. The experience gained in the drought affected areas under the proposed&#13;
Emergency project will be of benefit to those engaged in the formulation of a national response to&#13;
vulnerability to be supported under the PRSC. The timing of the preparation of the PRSC does not&#13;
correspond to the needs of the present emergency.&#13;
1V. THE EMERGENCY DROUGHT RECOVERY PROJEC'T&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
48.    The project objective is to enable Government to help affectedfamilies survive the crisis, retain&#13;
productive assets, and develop sustainable livelihoods, as well as contribute to stabilizing the&#13;
macroeconomy. The project will: (i) defend critical human development expenditure by Government&#13;
during the next year from the pressures caused by the current crisis; (ii) maintain the availability of&#13;
critical economic inputs (particularly those needed in rural areas) and support the economic recovery&#13;
process; (iii) rehabilitate and/or create communal assets using community labor of the affected&#13;
population, and (iv) provide income supplements, and protect private assets of the affected population.&#13;
The main indicator of project impact would be to reduce levels of outmigration of affected families&#13;
from their homes. The project would contribute to the stabilization of the macroeconomy, although&#13;
identifying its impact on inflation or other indicators is not possible. A logframe for the project is&#13;
presented in Schedule F.&#13;
Project Rationale&#13;
49.    The current drought exacerbates the problems faced by vulnerable groups in the food insecure&#13;
areas of Ethiopia, pushing an ever larger number of people to the brink. of survival. Vulnerability to the&#13;
current drought has been increased, due to the cumulative effects of the asset depletion (i.e. the&#13;
consumption of productive assets such as livestock, tools, health) incurred by families who survived the&#13;
droughts of 1999 and 2000. The current project will endeavour to respond to the crisis through the&#13;
strengthening of response mechanisms which defend minimum consurnption levels, and can continue to&#13;
be developed and used as part of a standard safety net under a social protection program under the&#13;
SDPRP. In designing the response, it is proposed to use the decentralized system of government and&#13;
budget management which is being promulgated under the SDPRP, so that the machinery for response&#13;
will become embedded in the new decentralized fiscal and service delivery structure of woreda&#13;
Government. This project is seen as a complement to development initiatives already in place which&#13;
seek to develop drought proofing infrastructure, in order to sustain the livelihoods of vulnerable groups&#13;
in the food insecure woredas -- such as the Bank supported Food Security Project, the USAID&#13;
supported Relief to Development project, the Pastoral Community Development Project which is under&#13;
preparation with Bank support, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit, also under preparation with&#13;
Bank support, and other initiatives. The project will also complement the relief and assistance&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
programs supported by other donors and NGOs in the response to the Government/UN Appeal of&#13;
December 7, 2002.&#13;
50.    The GOE has an overall objective to design an integrated approach to vulnerability that uses&#13;
transfers as an element of an overall growth strategy. In keeping with this approach the emergency&#13;
grant will help lay a foundation for a development oriented safety net which includes public works as a&#13;
key component, although this project is not the main vehicle to construct such a system. It is&#13;
recognized that the emergency grant needs to be fast disbursing and to conclude within a comparatively&#13;
short time horizon. Thus, longer term issues of sustainable transfers and a reformed and revamped&#13;
public works program, to be considered as part of the emergency grant, will be further addressed within&#13;
the context of the PRSC. Explicit attention will be given to the coherence of the approaches in these&#13;
two credits.&#13;
51.    Public works and free distribution are not, however, the only feasible means to address both&#13;
chronic and acute vulnerability. School enrolments generally fall during drought emergencies due to the&#13;
need for child labor in foraging and other household activities as well as due to the fatigue of hunger.&#13;
Children also drop out due to distress migration of families in search of food and fodder for livestock.&#13;
Similarly, malnutrition predictably increases. Yet, these merely reflect the fact that the drought&#13;
exacerbates long term problems. Transfers that can be linked to protecting school attendance or to&#13;
improved nutrition serve as human capital investments at the same time that they protect the vulnerable&#13;
from the drought.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
52.    The proposed operation (costed at US$ 61.7 million) includes three components:&#13;
Community interventions (US$ 16.5 million).&#13;
53.    These activities would be targeted to 35 woredas (Schedule I) in six Regions and would seek to&#13;
improve coping capabilities, reduce malnutrition in children, protect productive assets of the affected&#13;
population, and enable them to recover their productive capacity. The program would provide funds to&#13;
the Woreda rural development department through the Food Security Program financial mechanisms,&#13;
additional to the normal block grant. The component seeks to build on the ongoing Employment&#13;
Generation Scheme and Gratuitous Relief programs, managed by the Woreda government and&#13;
supported by food aid.&#13;
54.   Development Effectiveness. Building on EGS, the project would provide cash to complement,&#13;
support and improve the development impact of the activities currently supported using payment (in&#13;
food) for labour. Features of the combined program supported by both food and cash include: (i)&#13;
formalizing the 'project' to be identified, and carried out by the community -- identifying objectives,&#13;
timing for implementation, resource requirements, community contributions and design parameters. (ii)&#13;
summarizing the agreement in a simple contract signed between the community and Woreda&#13;
Government (that provides the basis for Bank disbursement against a community grant); (iii) defining&#13;
the menu of activities to be supported to only include investments for community and Government&#13;
owned or managed infrastructure; (iv) provide cash to finance additional materials as needed to enable&#13;
projects to address a broad range of community needs (materials for reconstruction of roads,&#13;
community schools and linked sanitation and water facilities, communal ponds, communal irrigation or&#13;
water harvesting systems, or other infrastructure of common use). Funds could also supplement labour&#13;
payments, or contract in technical assistance.&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55.    Targeted Nutrition. Building on the Gratuitous Relief program, the project would seek to&#13;
improve nutrition, by financing the inclusion of supplementary enriched food targeted at small children&#13;
and pregnant and lactating mothers in the 'food package' provided to affected families.&#13;
56.    School Attendance. Building on all relief food programs for drought affected families, the&#13;
project would fund an additional food allowance per girl attending school, to be promided against&#13;
attendance as certified by the teacher.&#13;
Quick disbursing assistance (US$ 43.5 million).&#13;
57.    The positive list of imports (listed in Schedule A) includes a list of items essential to support&#13;
the recovery of the economy, and of the agriculture sector in particular. The fast disbursing component&#13;
would contribute to stabilizing the macroeconomy by reducing the fiscal deficit, and making additional&#13;
foreign exchange available. Additional budgetary resources would permit the continuation of key&#13;
human development programs, otherwise likely to be affected by fiscal resource constraints caused by&#13;
the need to respond to the Emergency. In aggregate, the imports financed on Government's account, and&#13;
the counterpart generated from private sector imports, would be used to support the national Emergency&#13;
Drought Recovery Program . Retroactive funding would cover imports contracted as of December 7,&#13;
2002, up to an aggregate value of US$ 12 million.&#13;
Project management (U.S$ 1.7 million).&#13;
58.    Support and specialized staff would be provided for program management, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, finance, procurement, and rural engineering at the Federal level. Funding would be&#13;
provided for capacity building programs at the Region and Woreda. Select studies would be carried out&#13;
in drought prone parts of Ethiopia, on program effectiveness and impact.&#13;
Project Financing&#13;
59.   The size of the proposed grant of US$ 60 million is based on an assessment of financial&#13;
assistance to Government from other sources, and needs to cover (i) incremental foreign exchange&#13;
requirements due to the crisis, (ii) a sharp increase in budgetary expenditures due to the crisis; (iii) a&#13;
response to the request for non-food assistance associated with economic recovery efforts in the&#13;
Government's appeal, and (iv) the resources needed to carry out a rehabilitation program large enough&#13;
to have an impact on a significant portion of the 11.3 million persons who have been identified as&#13;
affected by the current drought.&#13;

made available to chronically vulnerable groups anyway, during late 2002, as well as additional&#13;
resources in response to the current appeal.&#13;
Implementation, Monitoring and Learning Arrangements&#13;
61.    Project implementation period. The project will be implemented over a period of 36 months&#13;
from June 2003, the estimated date of effectiveness, to June 30, 2006, the Project Completion Date.&#13;
The Closing Date for the project would be December 31, 2006. The period is long enough to enable the&#13;
lessons learned from long term impact of the safety net and social protection work, including the&#13;
various studies, to be incorporated into the ongoing design of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit&#13;
and the various public sector reform initiatives.&#13;
62.    Project management. At the national level, implementation of this project will be coordinated&#13;
out of the Food Security Department of the Ministry of Rural Development. This office is the&#13;
appropriate locus for the management of this project. The Minister for Rural Development, who is also&#13;
the Deputy Prime Minister, oversees all disaster prevention and relief activities (including DPPC and&#13;
ESRDF), as well as all agriculture and rural development activities, so he is well placed to call into&#13;
action any of the various agencies needed to assist Woreda Governments. There are Government/donor&#13;
committees in place which monitor the programming and delivery of relief and food security activities.&#13;
This project would fit into and use existing structures and not create new coordination mechanisms. By&#13;
doing so, it will be possible to build the Bank project into the fabric of the other contributions by donors&#13;
and civil society to the economic recovery program, and ensure full complementarity of effort at a&#13;
minimum cost. Responsibility for implementation of the community vulnerability reduction aspects of&#13;
the project will reside with Woreda government, for those Woredas affected by drought, and selected to&#13;
receive interventions from this project. Support for the Woreda government will be provided from the&#13;
Region and the Center.&#13;
63.   In light of the large volume of resources to be managed in a short period of time, it is foreseen&#13;
that a dedicated Project Management Unit will be established within the Food Security Department,&#13;
which will coordinate the use of Bank resources, and ensure that fiduciary requirements are met.&#13;
Under the project, a project coordinator, a procurement officer, a financial management officer, a&#13;
monitoring and evaluation officer and a rural engineer will be hired on a contract basis to staff this unit.&#13;
The PMU will work in concert with the National Bank of Ethiopia to disburse funding for eligible&#13;
imports under the quick disbursing component. The PMU will develop an Operations Manual which&#13;
will guide project activities in the implementation of the project, with particular emphasis on the&#13;
community initiatives component. Prior Grant effectiveness, a monitoring framework will be&#13;
developed which makes use of existing monitoring and information capture and transfer mechanisms,&#13;
adjusted as necessary to respond to the needs of this project, would be developed by the Project&#13;
Management Unit. This unit would provide regular reports on project implementation to the joint&#13;
Government-donor coordinating councils and the World Bank. Key monitorable indicators are provided&#13;
in Schedule F.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial Management, Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
64.    The Project Management Unit in the Food Security Department of the Ministry of Rural&#13;
Development will be in charge of implementing the project, and will assume responsibility for ensuring&#13;
that project execution meets the Bank's fiduciary standards. The Food Security Department currently&#13;
includes a project implementation team for the Bank funded Food Security Project (Credit 3646 ET)&#13;
and a second team charged with implementation of the Government's own Food Security Program.&#13;
65.    The capacity of Government to meet Bank requirements for financial management,&#13;
procurement and disbursement has been assessed and various measures will be put in place by Grant&#13;
effectiveness to ensure that staffing, systems and procedures are adequate to meet the Bank's fiduciary&#13;
requirements. A project coordinator, a financial management officer and a procurement officer will be&#13;
in place prior to Grant Effectiveness, by which time the Government will also have put in place a&#13;
financial management and a monitoring system capable of producing Financial Monilcoring Reports&#13;
(Model 3). The Government will maintain the accounts, provide reports and manage the resources&#13;
according to procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
66.    Retroactive financing. Retroactive finance would be made available for an aggregate value of&#13;
up to US$ 12 million for eligible expenditures procured using acceptable procedures, where the&#13;
expenditure was incurred after the date of the Government/UN appeal of December 7, 2002.&#13;
67.    Disbursements. The project will have one Special Account to cover the neecls of the&#13;
community interventions and the project management components. The quick disbursing component&#13;
would disburse directly to Government against eligible imports, and would not require a Special&#13;
Account. IDA would disburse 100 % against the value of eligible imports (excluding duties and taxes&#13;
and internal transport costs), and 100% against the amount disbursed by Government as a Subproject&#13;
Grant to communities. Disbursements for subproject grants will be against statements of expenditures.&#13;
These two expenditure categories cover over 95% of the foreseen expenditure under the project. A&#13;
Project Account to be operated by the PMU will be opened and funded with Birr 858,000 provided&#13;
prior to Grant Effectiveness, to provide for the counterpart funding needed to implernent the project.&#13;
68.    Procurement. Procurement procedures would be overseen by the Procurement Officer, a&#13;
member of the PMU in the Food Security Department of the Ministry of Rural Development. Prior to&#13;
project effectiveness, a procurement plan will be prepared by the PMU and presented to the Bank.&#13;
There are two main procurement processes under the project, which would consume 98 percent of the&#13;
IDA resources: (i) the quick disbursing component for US $ 43.5 million and (ii) the community&#13;
initiatives component, for US $ 15 million. The quick disbursing component wil I reimburse the CIF&#13;
cost of imports which are on the positive list (Schedule A) and meet the procurement requirement.&#13;
Purchases of goods under this component would make use of modified competitive bidding procedures.&#13;
Where appropriate, commonly traded commodities will be purchased using standard commercial&#13;
practice. Imports by the private sector valued at less than US$ 3 million per contract will also be&#13;
purchased using established commercial practice satisfactory to the Association. Imports by public&#13;
sector entities where the contract amount is less than US$ 750,000 can use international shopping&#13;
procedures. A small portion of the purchases to be made under this component can be made by direct&#13;
contracting, to cover nutritional supplements, seeds and other key inputs. The community initiatives&#13;
component will provide grants to communities, to fund subprojects developed with the assistance: of&#13;
local Government at the Woreda level and below. Simple procedures for local shopping and minor&#13;
works to be specified in the Operations Manual will cover most of the requirements. The maximum&#13;
grant size is US$ 100,000 under this component, but the average is expected to be well below US$&#13;
50,000.&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Main Grant Conditions&#13;
Conditions of Effectiveness&#13;
69.    The conditions of effectiveness ensure that the institutions charged with implementing the&#13;
project are in place and will be able to carry out their tasks effectively, meeting the management and&#13;
fiduciary standards required of IDA funded projects. These include:&#13;
(i)   the establishment of a satisfactory accounting and financial management system for the project;&#13;
(ii)  the opening of a Project account for counterpart funding;&#13;
(iii)  the adoption of a satisfactory Project Operations Manual;&#13;
(iv)   staffing of the Project Management Unit with key personnel including: a project coordinator, a&#13;
financial management officer, and a procurement officer.&#13;
Other Agreements&#13;

(i)    the preparation of a mid term review by December 31, 2004;&#13;
(ii)  the need to seek IDA agreement before making material changes in the Operations Manual;&#13;
(iii)  the preparation of an Environmental Management Plan and a Resettlement Policy Framework&#13;

(iv)   the appointment of a rural engineer within three months of the date of effectiveness of the&#13;
grant.&#13;
(v)    the terms and conditions under which the subproject grants will be provided to communties.&#13;
Project Sustainability&#13;
71.    While designated an emergency operation, this project will address issues which are at the core&#13;
of the development program for Ethiopia. The country's poverty reduction strategy seeks to addresses&#13;
the issues surrounding vulnerability -- how to prevent families from sinking into a trap of destitution&#13;
and continuous dependence, how to bring families out of this trap, and provide sustainable livelihoods.&#13;
The kind of safety net activities supported under this project are likely to be continued, and expanded&#13;
under future programs which support the SDPRP, such as the proposed Poverty Reduction Strategy&#13;
Credit. This project is designed to continue the efforts underway to date to enable vulnerable families&#13;
in Ethiopia to emerge from a poverty trap, and emphasizes the need to provide an extraordinary impetus&#13;
to these activities, in light of the catastrophic consequences of the recent drought.&#13;
Environmental and Social Aspects&#13;
72.    There are no significant environmental issues arising from this project. Potential safeguard&#13;
issues relate to the provision of small community level infrastructure, livestock management, cultural&#13;
property, and natural habitats. Critical wildlife habitats and existing parks are in the highest part of the&#13;
highland areas, in regions of adequate rainfall, outside of the affected areas. There are culturally&#13;
important stone churches and monuments in the affected area, but they are not threatened by the crisis.&#13;
The rural infrastructure components, which may include small, community level infrastructure such as&#13;
rural road rehabilitation and related works, school and clinic rehabilitation, small communal water&#13;
harvesting infrastructure, bunds, terraces, gully plugs, and erosion control infrastructure, have triggered&#13;
safeguard policies, and it is requested that the operation be classified Category B. Following appraisal,&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
an environmental assessment will be carried out which will set the stage for the implementation of a&#13;
mitigation plan, and for capturing and responding to monitorable indicators on high impact activities.&#13;
73.    An environmental assessment (EA) will be carried out by December 31, 2003, about six&#13;
months after project effectiveness. The EA will assess potential environmental and social impacts&#13;
related to livestock management, including water points; the provision of small, community-level&#13;
infrastructure; the level of environmental assessment and management capacity at The woreda level and&#13;
potential training needs; and it will assess the potential for coordination with ongoing projects such as&#13;
the ESRDF, the Emergency Rehabilitation Project and the planned Pastoral Community Development&#13;
Project. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will be prepared as part of thiis EA&#13;
74.    Construction of communal infrastructure (ponds, small irrigation, tracks) may involve the&#13;
acquisition of land and the withdrawal of access to land hitherto used by individuals. These activities&#13;
may therefore have an impact on the livelihood of individuals or cause involuntary resettlement&#13;
(although highly unlikely in an Ethiopian rural community context, as communal infrastructure&#13;
activities emanate from the communities themselves). The Government will undertake to prepare a&#13;
Resettlement Policy Framework in parallel with the Environmental Assessment and Management: Plan,&#13;
to be presented to the Bank by December 31, 2003.&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
75.    The major benefits expected to accrue from the project are: (i) families affected by the current&#13;
drought will receive support from the Government sooner, and with more resources, than would&#13;
otherwise have been the case; (ii) all of the aid received will be used more effectively, due to the&#13;
existence of timely and complementary cash inputs provided by the Bank; (iii) the macro-economy will&#13;
remain stable, and Government will not have to withdraw or divert resources from the implementation&#13;
of its normal, long run efforts to reduce vulnerability and create sustainable long term livelihoods for its&#13;
rural poor; (iv) mechanisms will be tested that will evolve into the tools for providing safety net support&#13;
to vulnerable Ethiopians over the long term; and (v) the rural public works programs will create&#13;
productive community assets and enhance sustainable livelihoods in r ural Ethiopia, in addition to&#13;
smoothing consumption of vulnerable households.&#13;
76.    Probably the greatest risk to the effectiveness of this intervention lies in the ability of the&#13;
woreda Governments to rise to the challenge of responding to the ongoing calamity. For this reason,&#13;
considerable effort and resources will be committed to support mechanisms, to develop and supplement&#13;
implementation capacity at the woreda, so that the programs indeed reach out to the vulnerable&#13;
communities in a timely fashion. A related, perhaps lower risk, lies in the difficulties, and lack of&#13;
commitment, associated with putting in place a woreda based, fiscally funded safety net, as proposed.&#13;
Risks associated with the mismanagement of resources are not great in Ethiopia, and will be minimized&#13;
with the use of management and financial systems tailored to the project, as well as through the use of&#13;
the fiscal budget itself.&#13;

Schedule C&#13;
Procurement, Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Procurement Arranrements&#13;
1.    Flexible Procurement Arrangements: Procurement arrangements and procedures shall be&#13;
commensurate with the emergency nature of the Project. In addition, the need has been recognized for&#13;
simple mechanisms to facilitate acquisition of materials and resources by communities in dispersed&#13;
locations. The arrangements devised are aimed at efficient procurement that underpin quick&#13;
disbursement and distribution of goods and money, mixing procurement on the local market in the&#13;
drought -affected areas with procurement and distribution from regional, national and international&#13;
levels.&#13;
2.     Manual of Procurement Procedures: An Operational Manual under the EDRP will be&#13;
prepared by the Borrower with assistance from the Bank. Bank procurement guidelines and policies&#13;
will be included in the Manual, for use by the PMU which will implement this project. The procedures&#13;
for community- based procurement shall also be included in the Manual, and will be used where&#13;
applicable.&#13;
Types of Procurement&#13;
3.     Positive List of Imports: IDA will provide financing for goods on a positive list of imports.&#13;
Retroactive financing shall cover imports as of December 7, 2002, up to 20% of the value of the grant.&#13;
The procurement review shall be done based on a random sample review for contracts from the private&#13;
sector. The review will be done on 10 % of the contracts for contracts with a value of USD 100,000.00&#13;
or less and 20% for contracts above USD 100,000.00. Goods on the positive list will procured using&#13;
Modified ICB. It is envisioned that disbursements will be made against invoices for imports on the&#13;
positive list, which have met the procurement guidelines. Under this category, commonly traded&#13;
commodities can be procured under contracts awareded under established commercial practices. Also,&#13;
goods imported by the private sector (under a contract ceiling of US$ 3,000,000) can be procured under&#13;
contracts awarded in accordance with established commercial practices satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
Private sector is defined to include financially autonomous state owned enterprises established and&#13;
operating according to Ethiopia's commercial legislation. In addition, for goods imported by the&#13;
public sector estimating to cost less than US$ 750,000 per contract, may be procured on the basis of&#13;
international shopping procedures.&#13;
4.&#13;
5.     Community-based Procurement: Each community will enter into a simple agreement with&#13;
the local government which sets out the scope of the activities and obligations of the parties. The&#13;
contract will provide for release of funds to the recipient who will, in turn, procure the specified items&#13;
from the local market. For some materials or services not locally available in adequate quantities, the&#13;
PMU at the Federal level (or the regional administration, as expedient) may award contracts (under the&#13;
project's procurement guidelines) and the regional administration will then undertake distribution of&#13;
such goods or supervision of such services. The release of funds to the community will be made in two&#13;
phases, based on the progress on the implementation. The committee will, through the woreda level&#13;
task force, supervise and finally record satisfactory completion of the support program by the recipient.&#13;
Another level of monitoring mechanisms operated by the Regional Administration will provide further&#13;
safeguards for ensuring that the money is used for the end use for which it was approved. The PMU at&#13;
the Federal level will have procurement audits conducted every six months and agree with the Bank on&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
any improvements needed in the system. This procedure will be utilized for control of use of the&#13;
counterpart funds allocated for these components.&#13;
In most rural areas, infrastructure and markets are not well developed. Therefore access to required&#13;
resources will be limited. No single solution is available and each Woreda should devise its own&#13;
solution. The alternative options available include the following.&#13;
o      Open Market: Where the market is strong, or where Woreda are located near to&#13;
towns, communities should be able to access resources;&#13;
o      Service Co-Operatives: on a commercial basis these could stock commodities that&#13;
the communities requires;&#13;
o      Community Groups getting together to buy similar commodities; from distant&#13;
markets;&#13;
o      Communities contract local merchants to provide materials and supplies.&#13;
6.     Proiect Related Procurement: For the remaining procurement, the tasks can be readily&#13;
defined and procurement plans prepared. Relevant Bank guidelines and procedures will operate for&#13;
goods, works (although few works are forseen outside of the community based acl:ivities) and services.&#13;
Procurement plans will be prepared and will provide the basis for agreement with IDA on the proposed&#13;
packaging and the optimal methods of procurement. Most of the procurement plans (to be included in&#13;
the Operations Manual) will be ready prior to Grant Effectiveness and will facilitate early&#13;
implementation of the emergency project. The portion of the credit that will be utilized for eligible&#13;
imports, including retroactive financing, will require: (a) use of a positive list, ancl (b) observance of the&#13;
Bank's procurement principles.&#13;
7.     Procurement methods will be subject to flexible limits on aggregate amounts to be procured,&#13;
thus giving the Borrower the option to choose the most suitable method of procurement for any given&#13;
case and to use easily accessible procedures such as national competitive bidding, and national&#13;
shopping.&#13;
Institutional Arraneements for Procurement&#13;
8.     For those components where community-based procurement methods will apply, The programs&#13;
would be carried out through funds provided to the community through the Woreda Rural Development&#13;
Department.&#13;
The non-community based procurement would be undertaken by the PMU at the Federal level. At least&#13;
one procurement staff will be recruited in the Federal EDRP-PMU. H-e(She) will conduct procurement&#13;
for the relevant components of the Project, but including eligible imports (and retroactive financing)&#13;
and will also be responsible for the quality and timeliness of procurement in the Project as a whole.&#13;
They will prepare procurement plans for the items to be procured. They will also monitor that adequate&#13;
number of staff are always in position in each individual component implementation unit and that all&#13;
are afforded procurement training, as needed. They will initiate periodic procurement audits and take&#13;
follow up action.&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Procurement Procedures&#13;
9.    IDA financed credit will be utilized for goods, training, consultancy, and operating costs under&#13;
the Project. Procurement for all IDA financed activities will be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 and revised in&#13;
January and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999). Consulting services by firns or&#13;
individuals will be awarded in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997; Revised September 1997; Addendum Effective&#13;
January 1, 1999. Simplified procedures for Emergency projects will be used, wherever needed.&#13;
10.   Consultant selection for assignments will be addressed through competition among qualified&#13;
short-listed firms and individuals in which the selection will be based on Quality-and-Cost-Based&#13;
Selection (QCBS) by evaluation of the quality of the proposal before comparing the cost of services to&#13;
be provided. In addition, selection shall also be done based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQ) and&#13;
other methods as provided for in the DGA. Shortlists for contracts estimated to cost under US$100,000&#13;
may be comprised entirely of national consultants if a sufficient number of qualified (at least three) are&#13;
available at competitive costs. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest, they will not be&#13;
excluded. Contracts less than US$100,000 each for firms, and US$50,000 for individuals, could be&#13;
contracted on the basis of CQ, and may be awarded on a single source basis only in exceptional&#13;
circumstances, after adequate justification and prior review of the TORs by IDA.&#13;
11.   Procurement of goods (in the non-quick disbursing components) will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1996,&#13;
August 1996, September 1997, January 1999). Contracts of individual value US$200,000 equivalent or&#13;
above will be awarded on the basis of ICB. Small value goods procurement contracts (individual value&#13;
of less than US$200,000) equivalent will be awarded on the basis of NCB. Contracts up to an aggregate&#13;
amount not to exceed US$200,000 equivalent maybe procured under community participation&#13;
arrangements using the simplified formats set forth in the Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and&#13;
Disbursement for Community- based Investments. Contracts less than US$50,000 each may be awarded&#13;
through National Shopping using approved procedures. The procedure to be adopted here is to award&#13;
fixed price contracts on the basis of written solicitation issued to at least three qualified suppliers after&#13;
evaluation of bids which would be received in writing.&#13;
12.   Procurement of works will be carried out in accordance with Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1996, August 1996, September 1997, January 1999).&#13;
Larger contracts of individual value US$500,000 equivalent or above will be awarded on the basis of&#13;
ICB. Small value works procurement contracts (individual value of less than US$500,000) equivalent&#13;
will be awarded on the basis of NCB. In spite of these provisions, no large works contracts are&#13;
foreseen. Contracts up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$1,000,000 equivalent maybe&#13;
procured under community participation arrangements using the simplified formats set forth in the&#13;
Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for Community-based Investments. Contracts&#13;
less than US$30,000 each may be awarded as small works through lump sum fixed price contracts on&#13;
the basis of written quotes from at least three qualified civil works contractors.&#13;
Prior Review Thresholds&#13;
13.   For procurement of goods, all cases valued at US$200,000 or more (with the exception of&#13;
purchases via the Positive List for Category I of the Disbursement Schedule) will require prior review&#13;
by IDA.&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14.    For Works, all cases valued at US$200,000 or more will require prior review by IDA.&#13;
However, large works are not foreseen for financing under this project.&#13;
15.    The Bank will review the selection process for the hiring of consultants proiposed by the&#13;
borrower for those consultancy contracts to be awarded to firms and individuals. Prior review will not&#13;
be required for contracts worth less than US$100,000 for firms and contracts worth less than&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals. However, IDA will review (a) all Terms of Reference of contracts,&#13;
regardless of value, (b) all single-source hiring, (c) assignments of a critical nature as determined by&#13;
IDA, (d) amendments of contracts raising the contract value above the prior review thresholds.&#13;
Risk Assessment&#13;
16.    Overall Risk Assessment is rated as High.&#13;
17.   A substantial portion of the intervention would be carried out by the communities through the&#13;
Woreda Rural Development Department. Due to the limitation of capacity of the community and&#13;
Woredas in handling such projects capacity need to be built at community and Woreda level. This&#13;
would be the most critical aspect of the procurement works. Very simple manuals for community&#13;
procurement, as appropriate in local languages need to be developed and training provided to the&#13;
Woreda and community representatives. The Community should also seek the support of NGOs,&#13;
Community Organizations in handling the community level activities. The first year action plan should&#13;
incorporate and give focus to training and development of the manuals.Frequency of procurement&#13;
supervisions proposed: One every six months, including special procurement supervision for post&#13;
review and audits&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial Management Arrangements&#13;
The Food Security Department (FSD) at the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) will be responsible&#13;
for the overall management of the project. The FSD is currently implementing a new IDA funded F'ood&#13;
Security Project (Credit no. 3646-ET of USD 85 million as well as a government and EU funded Food&#13;
Security Program. The Department has very little experience in implementing donor-financed projects.&#13;
As a result of this, an experienced financial officer is required to design a simple financial management&#13;
system that will produce accurate, reliable, timely and complete financial information about the project&#13;
activities. The Woreda Finance Offices will handle all the transactions related to the project and will on&#13;
regular basis report to the FSD at the MRD.&#13;
Fund Flows&#13;
The project will use a quick disbursing mechanism to disburse funds from the proceeds of the grant for&#13;
the quick disbursing component where the government will submit expenditures incurred on positive&#13;
list of imports agreed between the Government and the Bank. The quickc disbursing component will&#13;
support critical imports through a positive list of import requirements linked to the drought and assist&#13;
the government in drought recovery efforts. The Bank after reviewing evidences on the expenditures&#13;
incurred on the positive lists of imports will transfer the foreign exchange in to the accounts of the&#13;
MoFED to be opened at the National Bank of Ethiopia.&#13;
One Special Account (SA) will be opened by the FSD at the National Bank of Ethiopia for the&#13;
community grant and the project implementation and management components of the project. Funds&#13;
from the proceeds of the grant will be transferred to this SA based on the four months estimated&#13;
expenditures of the project. The initial advance will be USD 1.50 million, to be increased to 3.0 million&#13;
once disbursements exceed SDR 3.5 million. Subsequent replenishments will be made on the basis of&#13;
actual utilization. The project may use the Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for al I community grants,&#13;
training and operating costs; and consultancy services less than USD 100,000 for firms and less than&#13;
USD 50,000 for individuals. Full documentation will be submitted for all contracts above the SOE&#13;
limits. From the SA, the FSD may transfer money to the Woreda Finance Offices for eligible project&#13;
expenditures. The Woreda Development Committee (WDC) assisted by the Worecla Rural&#13;
Development Officer will approve specific proposals submitted by cornmunities. T'he Woreda Rural&#13;
Development Officer will help communities to prepare proposals, activities to be performed by&#13;
communities. Communities will enter into a contract with the WDC. Based on the aggregate proposals&#13;
submitted by the WDC, the FSD will transfer money to the bank account of the Woreda Finance Office&#13;
to be opened specifically for this purpose. The Woreda Finance Office based on the request from the&#13;
WDC will transfer money to the communities in installments, 50% initially and the remaining 50% of&#13;
the presentation satisfactory report on the utilization of the money. Communities are expected to&#13;
provide supporting evidences for the utilization of the money and all the supporting documents will be&#13;
kept at the Woreda Finance Office. Once the money is transferred to the communities, the Woreda&#13;
Finance Office will prepare and send SOEs to the FSD. The FSD will consolidate all the SOEs&#13;
collected from Woredas and the transactions at the FSD and submit withdrawal application to the Bank&#13;
for the replenishment of the SA.&#13;
Accounting and financial reportin'&#13;
The FSD will be responsible to maintain records and accounts, which reflects the resources and&#13;
expenditures of the project in line with sound accounting practice. The Finance Officer (FO) to be&#13;
employed by the FSD will develop a simple project and financial management systems, which will&#13;
provide adequate and relevant financial information on timely basis. The Financial transactions of the&#13;
project will be recorded in accordance with acceptable accounting standards acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The FO will prepare quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The FMRs will include financial,&#13;
procurement and physical reports of the project. The financial reports in the FMRs will include a&#13;
statement showing for the period and cumulatively cash receipts by sources and expenditures by main&#13;
expenditure classifications, beginning and ending cash balances of the project and supporting schedules&#13;
comparing actual and planned expenditures. The FMRs should be submitted to the Bank not later than&#13;
45 days after the end of each quarter. The format of the FMR will be agreed during negotiation of the&#13;
grant.&#13;
ExternalAudit&#13;
All the financial transactions of the project will be subject to external audit. The consolidated annual&#13;
project financial statements of the project, the movement in the special account (SA) and Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs) will be audited by an external auditor acceptable to IDA. The annual audited&#13;
financial statements, along with the management letter, will be submitted to IDA not later than six&#13;
months after the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
Since the Federal Auditor General is responsible for auditing all government funds, it will conduct the&#13;
audit or assign other external auditor to the project. External auditors will be appointed within six&#13;
months after the date of effectiveness. The terms of reference for the external auditors will&#13;
be developed and provided to the auditors before the commencement of their work.&#13;
Retroactive Financiuf&#13;
Retroactive financing in the amount of USD 12 million, which is equivalent to 20% of the grant&#13;
amount, will be provided to cover expenditures incurred on the positive list of imports before the grant&#13;
signing date, but after 7 December 2002, the date of the official appeal for support from the&#13;
international community.&#13;

Schedule H&#13;
Nutrition and Supplemental Feeding&#13;
Ethiopia has the highest level of child malnutrition in Africa; the incidence of underweight children has&#13;
been consistently around 45 percent over the last decade, much larger than the average incidence of 33&#13;
percent underweight children in Sub Saharan Africa in the nineties. Similarly, surveys in Ethiopia have&#13;
persistently found more than half the children under five stunted, an indicator of chronic malnutrition.&#13;
Stunting rates in these surveys often attaining more than 60 percent. By way of comparison the average&#13;
prevalence of children stunted for 19 Sub Saharan African countries in the mid-nineties was 39 percenl..&#13;
The current drought clearly exacerbates this situation. Many woreda level assessments iindicate that rates&#13;
of acute malnutrition are increasing, often exceeding 20% of the children, again far higher then the levels&#13;
observed in previous welfare monitoring surveys.&#13;
Malnutrition reflects a nexus of food access, health care, and child care. All three of these are affected by&#13;
the drought; compounding the overall food shortage, child health is placed fit greater risk due to the&#13;
shortage of water and the increase time burdens on care givers attendant to coping with the drought. GoE&#13;
response includes the provision of a ration of supplementary food - imported corn-soy-blend (CSB) or&#13;
locally produced mixes such as Famix and Unimix. Standard practice is to provide 15(0 gms per child per&#13;
day or 4.5 kilos a month. Ideally this is to be targeted to children found to be malnourished in the course&#13;
of screening or to pregnant and lactating women.&#13;
The most pressing problem with this distribution is the shortage of appropriate formulas leading to breaks&#13;
in distribution. Donations to the WFP have been insufficient to meet the expected distribution of between&#13;
10,000 and 16,000 tons a months, although the WFP reports increased pledges of CSB in recent weeks.&#13;
In addition, while the DPPC plans to purchase up to 3,000 tons of Famnix (and has budgeted 1 8M birr) the&#13;
factories that produce Famix and Unimix are working at capacity. Beyond the issue of aggregate&#13;
availability, efficient distribution of supplementary foods requires a targeting mechanism. Not all&#13;
woredas have conducted a nutritional survey and most that have done so still do not have the capacity for&#13;
individual screening.&#13;
It is also reported that households do not target this food on young children. This form of sharing within&#13;
a household is commonly observed, albeit difficult to quantify. It is not clear why households that receive&#13;
both 12.5 kilos of grain per capita as well as supplementary foods would share the supplementary food&#13;
among the family while the grain supply remains available. It is more likely that this would happen if the&#13;
household receives only supplementary foods (one woreda visited during assessment reported that the two&#13;
categories of recipients do not necessarily overlap). It is also likely that a household would reduce the&#13;
quantity of regular food provided to the child so that the supplementary food would not all be an addition&#13;
to the total intake of the child. Yet, even in this case, the quality of the child's diet may still be more&#13;
appropriate for growth than if the supplement were unavailable.&#13;
However, international experience indicates that the provision of supplements alone is less likely to have&#13;
a positive impact on child nutrition than if the distribution is accompanied by nutritional counseling that&#13;
explains the proper preparation of the supplement, the age appropriate quantities and timing of meals, and&#13;
other aspects of child care. Ideally, such counseling can also ensure that the child is up to date on&#13;
inoculations and that he or she has received vitamin A and, where required, dewormning medicines.&#13;
Few woredas have experience in such counseling, except where NGOs such as Concern and Save the&#13;
Children have set up capacity. Even in many woredas where NGOs are active in food distribution the&#13;
NGOs have not been able to establish a program for individual child screening and care giver counseling.&#13;
Any improvements in local capacity for either of these activities would not only assist in drought&#13;
response but also in establishing the base for investment in child nutrition.&#13;

Detailed Project Description&#13;
Component 1: Community interventions&#13;
Objective The community interventions component is to protect productive communal and private&#13;
assets, prevent child malnutrition, and avert drought induced school dropouls. The component seeks to&#13;
improve coping capabilities and protect productive assets of drought affected populations so as to enable&#13;
them to recover their productive capacity following the emergency period. This would be accomplished&#13;
by enhancing the effectiveness of existing food aid programs in drought affected areas, in rehabilitation or&#13;
creation of community infrastructure, and provision of nutrition programs, or incentives to education. The&#13;
project will work with ongoing Employment Generation Scheme and Gratuitous Relief programs&#13;
managed by the Woreda government and supported by food aid.&#13;
Rationale: The community interventions component attempts to mitigate three long tenn effects of the&#13;
drought: increased vulnerability due to loss of economic productivity, adverse health impacts due to&#13;
nutrition deficits and reduction of human capital caused by school dropouts. The productive capacities of&#13;
communities are depleted by the drought in two ways: immediate reduction in crop or livestock&#13;
production, which dramatically lowers current income, and reliance on coping mechanisms such as&#13;
selling livestock or other assets, that render households less able to generate income in the future. As a&#13;
result, vulnerability increases in the short and long term. Although the drought affected may receive&#13;
survival assistance through income transfers such as food aid, the long term problem of asset depletion&#13;
can lead to greater vulnerability. The growing number of chronically food insecure individuals (now&#13;
estimated at 4 - 5 million) is an indication that more households experience long term vulnerability and&#13;
are slipping into destitution.&#13;
Malnutrition reflects a nexus across food access, health care, and child care, all three of which have&#13;
been affected by the drought. In addition, child health is placed at greater risk due to the shortage of vvater&#13;
and the increased time burdens on care givers attendant to coping with the drought. With the relatively&#13;
high GAM rates found in drought affected areas, malnutrition represents a growing threat, especially&#13;
among those highly vulnerable to nutrition deficits - the very young as well as pregnant or lactating&#13;
women. Treating cases of very severe acute malnutrition requires costly therapeutic feeding, can result in&#13;
devastating health impacts or death, and ultimately slows the recovery process. Preventing such an&#13;
outcome can save resources as well as lives.&#13;
Net primary school enrolments in rural areas of most regions in Ethiopia are in the range of 25-30 % and&#13;
attendance often falls further during periods of drought due to demands for child labor as well as the&#13;
effects of hunger. Girls enrolment is particularly vulnerable - the national ratio of girls to boys&#13;
enrolment in primary and secondary school is only 61 %. School feeding is often proposed as a means to&#13;
address drought related enrolment problems and is currently supported by WFP in some 600 schools.&#13;
However, such programs incur high recurrent costs which the Ministry of Education views as&#13;
unsustainable and, in light of the need for substantial investments in infrastructure, they may not be good&#13;
candidates for counter-cyclical programs. A possible alternative to achieve many of the same objectives&#13;
would be food (or cash) for education grants that are conditional on school attendance using similar&#13;
mechanisms as are currently applied to the targeting of free food distribution.&#13;
Construction or Rehabilitation of Communal Assets:&#13;
The availability of cash for community interventions will allow drought affected communities to initiate&#13;
and implement their own development agenda, target recovery efforts more effectively and allow greater&#13;
success in completion and maintenance of selected assets. The Community asset building activities that&#13;
41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
are part of EGS are supported by government policy but ineffectively implemented due to lack of&#13;
complementing cash or material resources. In practice, activities that are easiest to implement given&#13;
resource, material, or technical expertise constraints have been the norm, and are primarily those that rely&#13;
solely on community labor resources. Because projects become make-work activities rather than&#13;
community investments or elements of Woreda development plans, many project activities are never&#13;
completed nor maintained. Improving public workfare programs by providing cash to be used for&#13;
purchase of materials, technical assistance or additional labor, would enable more effective and targeted&#13;
rehabilitation activities - resulting in projects that more truly reflect community needs.&#13;
Building on EGS (see Schedule G), the project would provide cash to complement, support and improve&#13;
the development impact of the activities currently supported using payment (in food) for labour. The&#13;
project will fund community based activities in 30-35 Woredas. Disbursement to affected communities&#13;
would be against an accepted project proposal from the community. Specific community interventions&#13;
will first take the form of a project proposal to be carried out by the community and will identify&#13;
objectives, timing for implementation, resource requirements, community contributions and design&#13;
parameters. Acceptance and implementation of the project proposal will be summarized in a simple&#13;
contract signed between the community and Woreda Government, and will provide the basis for Bank&#13;
disbursement against a community grant. Community grants amounts will be based on the number of&#13;
affected households in the community.. Grants to communities will be allocated against a menu of public&#13;
works and only include investments for community and Government owned or managed infrastructure.&#13;
The project will also provide cash to finance additional materials needed to enable projects to address a&#13;
broad range of community needs, provide supplemental labor payments or to contract in technical&#13;
assistance. A comprehensive menu of public works will focus on: materials for reconstruction of roads,&#13;
community schools and linked sanitation and water facilities, communal ponds, communal irrigation or&#13;
water harvesting systems, or other infrastructure of common use.&#13;
Woreda government will work with communities to complete the selected activity by: facilitating the&#13;
community in identifying objectives, activities, timing for implementation, resource requirements,&#13;
community contributions, and design parameters. In cases where Woreda Government lacks any of these&#13;
functions, contracted organizations or individuals are to be used to complete implementation.&#13;
Process indicators such as number of community grants and projects completed will be used to assess&#13;
success, as will outcome indicators such as prevention of asset loss (sale of livestock, distressed&#13;
migration).&#13;
Targeted Nutrition&#13;
The nutrition sub-component seeks to prevent malnutrition among small children and pregnant or&#13;
lactating women in the drought affected population. Supplementary food provision should prevent further&#13;
deterioration in health status of vulnerable populations and enable faster recovery from nutrition deficits.&#13;
Malnutrition reflects a nexus of food access, health care, and child care, all three of which have been&#13;
affected by the drought (see Schedule H). . In addition, child health is placed at greater risk due to the&#13;
shortage of water and the increased time burdens on care givers attendant to coping with the drought.&#13;
With the relatively high GAM rates found in drought affected areas, malnutrition represents a growing&#13;
threat, especially among those highly vulnerable to nutrition deficits - the very young as well as pregnant&#13;
or lactating women. Treating cases of very severe acute malnutrition requires costly therapeutic feeding,&#13;
can result in devastating health impacts or death, and ultimately slows the recovery process. Preventing&#13;
such an outcome can be save resources as well as lives.&#13;
Government and donor response to prevent acute malnutrition includes the provision of a ration of&#13;
supplementary food - impo. ed corn-soy-blend (CSB) or locally produced mixes such as Famix and&#13;

Unimix. Standard practice is to provide 150 gins per child per day or 4.5 kilos a month tLrgeted to&#13;
children found to be malnourished in the course of screening. Although it is likely that households reduce&#13;
the quantity of regular food provided to the child so that the supplementary food would not all be an&#13;
addition to the total intake of the child, the quality of the child's diet may still be more appropriate for&#13;
growth than if the supplement were unavailable.&#13;
The most pressing problem with supplementary food provision among the drought affected is the&#13;
shortage of appropriate formulas. Donations to the WFP have been insufficient to meet the expected&#13;
distribution of between 10,000 and 16,000 tons a month and DPCC lacks resource to purchase large&#13;
amounts locally. Provision of supplementary food to Woredas receiving the cash grant sub-component of&#13;
the EDRP would fill a critical gap in drought recovery efforts and maintain nutritional stattus in the most&#13;
vulnerable populations.&#13;
The sub-component will complement food aid distribution associated with the Gratuitous Relief program&#13;
and finance the inclusion of supplementary enriched food targeted at small children and pregnant and&#13;
lactating women. It will permit funding to claose the gap between the donations received and the&#13;
requireemtns to provide an additional 4.5 kg/per month of supplementary food (Famix, Unimix, or CSB)&#13;
will be allocated to each eligible individual receiving food aid through DPCC or donor agencies.&#13;
Distribution to affected populations will be organized by DPPC, who will receive the allocation of&#13;
supplementary food at the federal level and distribute along with normal food aid deliveries.&#13;
However, international experience indicates that the provision of supplements alone is less likely to have&#13;
a positive impact on child nutrition than if the distribution is accompanied by nutritional education&#13;
regarding the proper preparation of the supplement, the age appropriate quantities and timing of meals,&#13;
and other aspects of child care. The project will fund mass media or other nutritional education programs&#13;
to complement the provision of the supplementary food.&#13;
Nutritional data gathered through DPPC and other surveys will be the primary indicator used.&#13;
School Attendance Promotion&#13;
The school attendance program is aimed at maintaining school enrolment in drought afficted through&#13;
provision of cash or food transfers to drought affected families in return for school attendance by girl&#13;
children.&#13;
Net primary school enrolments in rural areas of most regions in Ethiopia are in the range, of 25-30 % and&#13;
attendance often falls further during periods of drought due to demands for child labor as well as the&#13;
effects of hunger. Girls enrolment is particularly vulnerable - the national ratio of girls to boys&#13;
enrolment in primary and secondary school is only 61 %. School feeding is often proposed as a means to&#13;
address drought related enrolment problems and is currently supported by WFP in some 600 schools.&#13;
However, such programs incur high recurrent costs which the Ministry of Education views as&#13;
unsustainable and, in light of the need for substantial investments in infrastructure, they may not be good&#13;
candidates for counter-cyclical programs. A possible alternative to achieve many of the same objectives&#13;
would be food (or cash) for education grants that are conditional on school attendance using similar&#13;
mechanisms as are currently applied to the targeting of free food distribution.&#13;
Human resource assets represent the long term future of rural development in Ethiopia and efforts to&#13;
encourage school attendance have received little attention in much of Ethiopia's food security efforts.&#13;
Although one significant contributor to school drop out - internal migration - is not likely to be affected&#13;
by school based programs, successful general relief efforts should mitigate this factor. School grants for&#13;
enrolment represent an effective medium term response to the impact of drought on eduicational&#13;
attainment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The WFP manages a pilot project in pastoral areas that provides four liters of cooking oil every two&#13;
months to girls who attend at least 80% of school days in a given period as certified by a teacher. The&#13;
project will fund an extension of this project to schools in Somali and Afar regions regardless of whether&#13;
the schools currently have a school meal program. WFP will serve as advisors to the GoE and thus create&#13;
capacity in the administration and procurement issues necessary for such a project.&#13;
Component 2: Ouick disbursing assistance&#13;
Objective: The quick disbursing component will finance key economic inputs through a positive list of&#13;
imports. Such financing will enable Government to respond to the drought emergency by providing&#13;
foreign exchange and counterpart revenue for use in the Government's drought recovery efforts. This will&#13;
also prevent re-direction of public investment away from the long term poverty reduction program.&#13;
Rationale: Ethiopia's recent macroeconomic gains are threatened by the drought, which will not only&#13;
increase public expenditures, but lower economic growth. As noted above, the Government's revised&#13;
macroeconomic forecast anticipates large increases in government expenditures and a worsening trade&#13;
deficit. According to the IMF, Ethiopia has only recently doubled its international reserves from 2 to 4&#13;
months of imports and importation of drought relief and recovery materials - food, fertilizer, seeds,&#13;
medicines and transportation equipment - will require scarce foreign exchange. Much of the international&#13;
response to the emergency is in the form of food aid with relatively little allocated to non-food assistance.&#13;
This component will allow Government to maintain a supply of critical economic inputs for recovery&#13;
efforts by providing finance for imports.&#13;
The 2002/2003 drought has also put greater stress on the Government's Development Budget by&#13;
increasing public expenditure requirements. Social spending in Ethiopia has risen consistently in past&#13;
years and accounted for 22.6 percent of all total government expenditures in 2001. This was a substantial&#13;
increase over previous years and reflected the Government's renewed commitment to poverty reduction.&#13;
However, the human development and poverty reduction agenda may be jeopardized by drought relief&#13;
requirements as it was during the emergency caused by war with Eritrea - when social expenditures&#13;
dropped from a high of 24 percent of total expenditures in 1996/1997 to 16 percent in 1999/2000. (IMF,&#13;
2002) Defending human development expenditures will be key to maintaining the human resource asset&#13;
base necessary for Ethiopia's long term development.&#13;
Description: The quick disbursing component will finance a positive list of imports (Schedule A) that&#13;
includes a list of items essential to support the recovery of the economy, and of the agriculture sector in&#13;
particular. The imports financed on Government's account and the counterpart generated from private&#13;
sector imports will be used to support the national Emergency Drought Recovery Program. Retroactive&#13;
financing of up to 20 percent of the total will be allowed for purchases posted after December 7th 2002.&#13;
Key performance indicators: The outcomes envisaged by the component - defense of Government's&#13;
social expenditures and stable supply of critical inputs - will be measured by price data and sectoral&#13;
shares of government budget allocations.&#13;
Component 3: Project Manacement&#13;
The project coordination, monitoring and study component will support implementation of components 1&#13;
and 2 with the additional objective of contributing to the policy dialogue that surrounds food security and&#13;
safety net programs in Ethiopia. Program monitoring and funded technical studies should develop greater&#13;
understanding of food security and vulnerability issues as well as the role of a medium term response to&#13;
drought crises.&#13;
44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Government's Food Security Program is at the center of efforts to link development and relief&#13;
activities with EGS as its primary instrument. International best practice in public workfare schemes show&#13;
large differences with Ethiopia's EGS version, primarily in targeting criteria, selection of activities,&#13;
implementation arrangements, participation norms, and wage rates. Further study on public workfare&#13;
programs in the Ethiopian context could inform Government and donor activities in this area. Other&#13;
aspects of vulnerability reduction - community targeting, nutrition, school attendance - are also&#13;
important to broadening the policy debate and contributing to the greater success of current and future&#13;
drought recovery projects.&#13;
The emergency nature of the project necessitates quick implementation and administration of the project.&#13;
Technical support is particularly necessary, as the community project activities envisioned in the&#13;
community intervention sub-component will likely require expertise not available at the Kebele or&#13;
Woreda level. Design of irrigation systems, water harvesting structures, and road or building construction&#13;
may be required and exceed local capacity.&#13;
Funding support will be provided to staff and administer the project managenment unit, training of Woreda&#13;
government in project implementation, technical expertise for community project activities, creation of&#13;
amonitoring and evaluation system, and studies on food security and vulnerability reduction.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Drought Recovery Project
            in Ethiopia, will enable the Government to help affected
            families survive the emergency, retain productive assets,
            and develop sustainable livelihoods, and in addition, will
            contribute to stabilizing the macro-economy. Main project
            outcomes will contribute to defend critical human
            development expenditure by the Government during the first
            year of the crisis; maintain the availability of critical
            economic inputs (particularly in rural areas), and support
            the economic recovery process; rehabilitate and create
            communal assets, using community labor within affected
            populations; and, provide income supplements, and protect
            private assets of affected populations. The main indicator
            of project impact would be reduced levels of out-migration
            of affected families from their homes. While the project
            will undoubtedly assist drought-affected populations through
            cash inputs, and macroeconomic stabilization, risks include
            weak management capacity, particularly at the community
            levels, which as stipulated, the use of existing, simple
            systems will be used to reach communities, and improve
            program impacts. Moreover, taking into consideration that
            the dependence on food aid among rural communities in food
            insecure areas, may be deepened, project aid in the
            provision of income, and infrastructure development, should
            support regeneration of productive assets.
