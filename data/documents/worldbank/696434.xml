TECHNECAL ANNEX&#13;
I. COAL SECTOR REsTRucTuRING PROGRAM&#13;
A. GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY&#13;
1.1          The Government of the Russian Federation has prepared a large scale restructuring&#13;
program aimed at transforming the coal industry into a sustainable and competitive sector of the&#13;
economy. The program is designed to improve coal industry efficiency by creating a non-&#13;
monopolized organizational structure which would include strong regional coal companies. In&#13;
addition to this, the program stipulates a shift in the focus of coal subsidies from financing&#13;
wages and uneconomic mines to restructuring of coal companies in a manner that is clear,&#13;
transparent and monitorable. Unlike coal industry restructuring programs in other countries&#13;
where coal production capacities were reduced by up to 80-90%, the coal industry in Russia&#13;
after restructuring is expected to remain one of the largest in the world.&#13;
1.2          The Government has demonstrated a substantial commitment to coal sector reform&#13;
over the past few years, including: (a) liberalization of coal prices;1' (b) a significant reduction&#13;
in the levels of subsidies in real terms; (c) reduction of RosUgol's role in the allocation and&#13;
distribution of subsidies;2' (d) the issuance of a Presidential Decree which allows organizations&#13;
other than Rosugol to act as trust managers for the state shares in regional coal companies; and&#13;
(e) commencement of downsizing and other measures to increase efficiency, including cessation&#13;
of coal production at 37 loss-making mines which have no prospects for economic viability and&#13;
a significant reduction in the total workforce (by 20% over the past four years). In sum, the&#13;
initial restructuring efforts have begun to pay off, and coupled with sharp increases in domestic&#13;
coal prices toward the end of 1995, the industry as a whole reported Rbl.5 trillion of net income&#13;
in 1995 and an increase in labor productivity by 11 percent.&#13;
1.3          Long Term Strategy, 1996-2000. In July 1995, the Inter-Agency Commission for&#13;
Socio-Economic Problems of Coal-Producing Regions (IAC) issued a consensus document on&#13;
Basic Trends for Coal Restructuring (Basic Trends). The main elements of the Government's&#13;
long term strategy are:&#13;
1/    In July 1993, the Government took the first major step towards restructuring the coal industry, viz., all&#13;
federal administrative controls on coal prices were removed. This first step was not fully effective,&#13;
since RosUgol retained the power to influence individual coal prices by directing smaller or larger&#13;
subsidy flows to individual coal companies.&#13;
2/    Specifically, about 90% of the subsidies are currently distributed by the Treasury Departments of the&#13;
Federal and regional governments. Moreover, the Coal Commission will start allocating quarterly&#13;
subsidies (broken down on a monthly basis) starting from the third quarter of 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                           Chapter I&#13;
(i)   Subsidies. Subsidies to loss-making mines will be gradually withdrawn.&#13;
Alternative sources of funding will be used to finance maintenance of social assets and&#13;
to increase expenditure on social programs that support coal restructuring.&#13;
(ii)  Investment. Modernization, rehabilitation and expansion will have to rely more&#13;
on internal financing by coal companies, loans, direct private domestic and foreign&#13;
investment and extra-budgetary sources, in addition to state support.&#13;
(iii)  Mine Closures. At least 90 loss-making mines (overall capacity 60 million&#13;
tons/year, with total direct workforce of 83,000 people) will be closed.&#13;
(iv)   Workforce Reductions. Closure of loss-making companies and modernization of&#13;
remaining mines will result in reduction of the workforce by 100,000 people, or 20%&#13;
against the 1994 level. Further reduction of the workforce by 175,000 people will take&#13;
place as non-core production activities are divested.&#13;
(v)   Social Protection. The main goal of social protection of redundant miners is to&#13;
provide transitional assistance in parallel with programs to create new, unsubsidized jobs.&#13;
(vi)   Change Management. The federal and regional authorities, in cooperation with&#13;
RosUgol, RosTopProm and local coal companies, will restructure the system of state&#13;
support and management of the coal industry.&#13;
(vii)  Commercialization and Demonopolization. The coal industry will consist of a&#13;
number of independent, competing coal companies that are self-financed on a long term&#13;
basis. RosUgol will be transformed into a joint stock company whose goals reflect the&#13;
goals of coal sector restructuring.&#13;
1.4         Medium  Term  Goals. In the period since Basic Trends was issued, the&#13;
Government has prepared a set of intermediate goals for 1996-97. In particular, coal subsidies&#13;
were reduced in real terms in 1996 and Government announced its intention to reduce them&#13;
again in 1997 by at least 15% in real terms. Government also announced a target of 30% for&#13;
the share of coal subsidies to be allocated to downsizing/restructuring in 1996, followed by a&#13;
substantial increase in this share in 1997. In addition, Government transferred the responsibility&#13;
for allocating coal subsidies from RosUgol to the IAC and announced monitoring and auditing&#13;
systems to ensure that coal subsidies are received and used for their designated purposes.&#13;
Further, starting in mid-1995, the regions have been submitting draft Regional Coal&#13;
Restructuring Programs to the IAC as a basis for future funding of restructuring costs and&#13;
associated social programs. The IAC has now approved programs for five of the nine major coal&#13;
basins. Finally, in February 1996, a Presidential Decree was issued that empowers Government&#13;
to strengthen the regional coal companies and to assign trust management of the state's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter I                                                                           3&#13;
shareholding in these companies to various trust agents.2' The Government intends to use these&#13;
powers during 1996 and 1997 to appoint a number of new trust agents to manage the&#13;
restructuring and privatization of selected regional companies.&#13;
1.5         Government's Short Term Action Program, 1996. For the immediate future, the&#13;
Government has a detailed program of actions for the second half of 1996 and early 1997. This&#13;
program consists of: (i) targets for reducing coal subsidies and refocusing remaining subsidies&#13;
on downsizing/restructuring; (ii) changes in employment policies in the coal industry to minimize&#13;
the need for compulsory redundancies; (iii) an acceleration of mine closure completions - but&#13;
with increased attention to social safeguards; (iv) a substantial reinforcement of the social safety&#13;
net in coal regions - in the form of new community employment and labor mobility programs&#13;
and improved delivery of basic social services; (v) new initiatives to promote public participation&#13;
in the coal restructuring program and to monitor the social impacts of the program; (vi) a&#13;
systematic program to strengthen the independence of regional/local coal companies; and (vii)&#13;
additional support for the IAC to- implement the coal restructuring program.&#13;
B. THE PROPOSED COAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN&#13;
1.6         The proposed Coal Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL), in an amount of US$500&#13;
million equivalent, will help the Government put in place a consistent policy and institutional&#13;
framework for the continuous and socially sustainable restructuring of the sector and provide&#13;
assistance in implementing the initial steps of the overall restructuring program of the coal&#13;
sector. In particular, the Coal SECAL will support:&#13;
a program for the progressive reduction and eventual elimination of subsidies&#13;
through (i) the elimination of subsidies for operating losses and investment, (ii)&#13;
the redirection of remaining subsidies towards restructuring and related social&#13;
programs, and (iii) the establishment of a transparent mechanism for the&#13;
allocation and effective monitoring of subsidies;&#13;
*     special Community Support and Employment Programs in areas where coal-&#13;
related unemployment is expected to be high; and&#13;
*     the development and initial implementation of measures intended to commercialize&#13;
and de-monopolize the coal sector.&#13;
1.7         The Coal SECAL  would be accompanied by the proposed Coal Sector&#13;
Restructuring Implementation Assistance Project to provide the necessary institutional support&#13;
critical for the success of the Program. The proposed Coal SECAL will be disbursed against&#13;
satisfactory implementation of the coal reform program, including compliance with stipulated&#13;
tranche release conditions. Disbursements will not be linked to any specific purchases, but will&#13;
3/    Presidential Decree No. 168, February 9, 1996, 'On Measures Regarding the Further Improvement of&#13;
the Structure of the Coal Industry of the Russian Federation", empowers the Government to move&#13;
forward with demonopolization of the coal industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                           Chapter I&#13;
be subject to a negative list. Tranche release review and program supervision will ensure that&#13;
the restructuring program supported under the Coal SECAL is carried out as agreed, including&#13;
timely provision of resources by the Government to meet the costs of program implementation.&#13;
The first tranche (US$250 million equivalent) release is scheduled upon Loan effectiveness,&#13;
expected in July 1996. Disbursement of the second tranche (US$250 million equivalent),&#13;
anticipated before the end of 1996, would be contingent on a review, satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
of (i) macroeconomic performance; (ii) the successful implementation of the reform program as&#13;
a whole; and (iii) the fulfillment of specific second tranche release conditions.&#13;
1.8         The objectives announced in Basic Trends for Coal Restructuring have now been&#13;
largely translated into specific targets, mechanisms and dates. The key elements of the&#13;
restructuring program supported by the proposed Coal SECAL include the following:&#13;
i.    A schedule of state support to the coal industry for the second half of 1996 would&#13;
be made public, and state financing for the coal sector would continue to be reduced in&#13;
1997;&#13;
ii.   state support funds for investment will be available on a non-reimbursable basis&#13;
only for projects where construction began before January 1, 1996. For all other&#13;
investment projects in the coal industry, state support will be available on a repayable&#13;
basis only;&#13;
iii.   state support for operating losses will be available only to coal companies that&#13;
have reduced the number of vacancies so as to limit total recruitment in any quarter to&#13;
less than 1 % of the total number of employees;&#13;
iv.   the Federal Employment Services would establish, by the end of September 1996,&#13;
the capability to deliver pre-redundancy services including advance notice and counselling&#13;
to all workers in the coal industry threatened with redundancy;&#13;
v.   the IAC would approve and make public a Demonopolization Program  to&#13;
conclude, by December 31, 1996, the appointment of new Trust Managers. These&#13;
measures will include the issuance, by October 31, 1996, to potential bidders for trust&#13;
management contracts all of the information required by them for the preparation of bids.&#13;
The companies for which new Trust Managers will be appointed by December 31, 1996&#13;
will be selected so that their aggregate production of coal in 1995 would not be less than&#13;
65 million tons, i.e., approximately 25% of the Russian coal industry; and&#13;
vi.  the IAC would make public the indicators and arrangements for social impact&#13;
monitoring, financial monitoring, and auditing of a set of subsidy recipients.&#13;
a.     Social Impact Indicators include:&#13;
*     access to severance compensation specified in the Employment Law&#13;
*     availability and accessibility of training, re-training, job placement and job&#13;
counselling services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter I                                                                         5&#13;
*     access to adequate level of social services in the course of sector&#13;
restructuring&#13;
*     access to heating, housing maintenance and utilities&#13;
*     access to and availability of information on social safety measures prior&#13;
to departures from the sector (whether voluntary or not)&#13;
*     provision of pre-redundancy counselling at mines announced for closure,&#13;
and&#13;
*     adequacy of participation / representation in relevant decisions.&#13;
b.    Financial Impact Indicators include agreed data on:&#13;
*     Subsidies&#13;
*     Output.and employment&#13;
*     Revenues and Expenditures&#13;
*     Receivables and Payables, and&#13;
*     Capital expenditure.&#13;
c.    Special Purpose Audits will be carried out in accordance with International&#13;
Auditing Standards and will determine whether or not:&#13;
*     financial reports and related supporting schedules prepared by the entities&#13;
being audited give a true and fair view of the financial situation of&#13;
resources and expenditures related to state financing;&#13;
*     financial information is presented in accordance with established or stated&#13;
criteria by the Government and by RosUgol;&#13;
*     the use of state financing for each subcategory of subsidies has complied&#13;
with the relevant laws, regulations, policies and contractual agreements;&#13;
and&#13;
*     the audited entities' internal control systems used in administering state&#13;
financing are adequate.&#13;
vii.  no state support for operating losses would be made available to coal mines which&#13;
have recruited employees in excess of 1 % of their respective total number of employees&#13;
during such period;&#13;
viii.  initiation of the operation of the regional offices of the Federal Employment&#13;
Services, in all regions where mines are being closed, with adequate capacity to deliver&#13;
pre-redundancy services free of charge to employees prior to cessation of coal production&#13;
for all coal industry employees of mines whose closure has been announced; and&#13;
ix.   the Government would establish the necessary institutional framework, which&#13;
includes the participation of the Federal Employment Services, and would initiate the&#13;
activities of the Community Support and Employment Programs in the Kuzbass, Eastern&#13;
Donbass, Pechora, Moscow region and Kisel coal basins.&#13;
1.9         Environmental Assessment. Environmental issues are potentially important in&#13;
mine closures. The Bank undertook an extensive review of the environmental problems of the&#13;
coal industry in preparing the 1994 sector report. This review concluded that the most serious&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                         Chapter I&#13;
environmental problems in mining areas were linked to the burning of coal rather than to mining&#13;
activities per se. Apart from a small number of localized issues, the main weaknesses in the&#13;
environmental performance of mining were the consequence of poor incentives and bad&#13;
management that sustained inefficient mining practices encouraged by a focus on meeting output&#13;
targets. Thus, reform of incentives and operating procedures combined with the closure of the&#13;
most inefficient mines, which tend to cause disproportionate environmental damage, will reduce&#13;
the environmental damage caused by the industry.&#13;
1.10        Specific measures will be required to ensure that mine closures occur in an orderly&#13;
manner that takes account of the need to cap operating or disused shafts, to minimize risks&#13;
associated with the accumulation of gas in old mine workings, and to deal with any problems&#13;
following the flooding of old workings. Design institutes and other organizations have experience&#13;
in preparing plans and implementing the appropriate measures, though there is a tendency to opt&#13;
for over-elaborate schemes which concentrate too much on the recovery of equipment that cannot&#13;
be economically justified.&#13;

Participatory Activities&#13;
2.3          The general framework for participation strategy in support of the Government&#13;
Coal Sector Restructuring Program is outlined in the Social Assessment report. The basic&#13;
elements of this strategy include:&#13;
a)    Information/communication support to the Program, focusing primarily on the&#13;
empowerment of the miners, their families and their communities through (i)&#13;
provision of information on the Program; (ii) clarify the roles and responsibilities&#13;
of local, regional and Federal institutions in implementation of reforms and in the&#13;
delivery of social safety packages defined by the Coal Sector Restructuring&#13;
Program, and to help create trust in these institutions; and (iii) enhancement of&#13;
transparency in reform implementation;&#13;
b)    Public relations support to create and sustain constituency for reform and help&#13;
broaden ownership of reform objectives; public and government relations support&#13;
to legislative changes that may be put in place to enhance geographical and job&#13;
mobility;&#13;
c)    Support to  consultative  local institutions representing  interests of key&#13;
stakeholders, in particular of miners and their communities; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter II                                                                          9&#13;
d)    Continuous social assessment and social impact monitoring to have feedback from&#13;
the most directly affected populations.&#13;
2.4          The proposed program to support stakeholders participation is presented in Annex&#13;
1 and the draft Terms of Reference for technical assistance and training in industrial relations&#13;
are in Annex 2.&#13;
Social Programs&#13;
2.5          Social Assessment and Social Impact Monitoring. Social assessment conducted&#13;
in two coal mining regions (Pechora and Kuzbass) in connection with closure of unprofitable&#13;
mines indicated a number of shortcomings in the existing system of social protection of laid-off&#13;
workers and the need for improvement. Given the significant diversity among the various coal&#13;
mining regions, it is necessary to expand social assessment to the other regions where mine&#13;
closures take place. Continued social assessment and social impact monitoring will allow for the&#13;
consideration of specific local features related to the social impact of the restructuring, define&#13;
concretely the measures for social protection of the laid-off workers and their families,&#13;
pensioners and disabled worked in the coal industry, contribute to enhancement of transparency&#13;
in the use of state support allocated by the government for the measures connected with mine&#13;
closing and provide public support to the reforms in coal industry. The draft Terms of Reference&#13;
for social assessment and social impact monitoring are in Annexes 3 and 4, respectively.&#13;
Social Safety Net Policy Framework&#13;
2.6          Starting in mid 1995, coal regions have been submitting draft Regional Coal&#13;
Restructuring Programs to the IAC for approval. These programs include proposals for&#13;
incremental social programs in coal regions and for transfer of social assets (mainly housing,&#13;
kindergartens and health clinics) from coal companies to regional or local governments. At&#13;
present, the incremental social programs remain unfunded. Further, the funding of social asset&#13;
operating costs after transfer to local government remains unclear. In the second half of 1996&#13;
IAC will consider possible options to address these problems. The measures of the government&#13;
in Social Policy include: (a) social protection of coal industry employees and residents of the&#13;
coal regions, and (b) the development of social infrastructure in mining communities.&#13;
2.7          Social Protection. The main actions in the field of social protection include: (a)&#13;
the provision of social guarantees, benefits and compensation for workers made redundant during&#13;
restructuring, members of their families, pensioners and disabled people retired from the coal&#13;
industry, and (b) measures to promote employment opportunities and skills in areas affected by&#13;
the restructuring of the coal industry. Russia has a system of social guarantees for people made&#13;
redundant from enterprises. The Government will ensure that:&#13;
*     employees made redundant from mines receive statutory severance payments and&#13;
compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Employment Law;&#13;
*     various ministries and agencies participating in the creation, financing and&#13;
implementation of social programs during mass layoffs coordinate their assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                                         Chapter II&#13;
2.8         Employees at the mines announced for restructuring or closure will be offered&#13;
counseling free of charge. These counseling services will be organized by the Federal&#13;
Employment Services (FES), financed by the mine out of funds provided by the IAC. They will&#13;
be designed with the involvement of workers, management and local authorities and will include&#13;
(a) an agreed procedure for advance notice of redundancy, and (b) a rapid response mechanism&#13;
which uses a joint consultative approach where trained advisors will work with employees and&#13;
with the local communities.&#13;
2.9         In the second half of 1996 the Government will establish pilot Community Support&#13;
and Employment Programs in Kuzbass, Eastern Donbass, Pechora, Moscow and Kisel coal&#13;
basins using funds allocated for social protection expenditures of state support to the coal&#13;
industry. These programs would include social projects and measures on assistance for&#13;
employment. The primary recipients of the funds allocated for these programs will be the&#13;
governments of Subjects of the Russian Federation where the above-mentioned regions are&#13;
located. The ultimate recipients will be the organizations authorized by the local governments.&#13;
The FES will participate in the design and implementation of these Community Support and&#13;
Employment Programs and the resources of local Employment Funds will be used in conjunction&#13;
with them.&#13;
2.10        State financing will support a range of programs such as (a) the repair of the&#13;
social and environmental infrastructure, (b) the creation of small business opportunities, (c)&#13;
retraining, (d) job counseling and search, and (e) other initiatives to create new jobs in viable&#13;
enterprises. The programs will be a part of regional programs for socioeconomic development&#13;
of coal mining regions and coal industry restructuring. Special attention will be given to the&#13;
needs of communities dominated by single mine enterprises, where coal restructuring will also&#13;
have a severe impact on non-mining families. Starting from 1997 programs of Community&#13;
Support will be implemented in all coal basins.&#13;
2.11        Suppoit for Social Infrastructure. The government policy proceeds from the fact&#13;
that restructuring of coal industry should not mean the deterioration in volume or quality of&#13;
social services provided to people residing in mining communities. In the course of restructuring&#13;
the following issues will be resolved with the help of funds allocated from state support:&#13;
completing the transfer of social assets and housing owned by coal companies to municipal&#13;
authorities; provision of stable operation of the social assets transferred to the local governments;&#13;
demolition or renovation of dilapidated housing.&#13;
2.12        In order to provide adequate finance for the operation and maintenance of social&#13;
assets in the coal mining regions the Government will allocate the funds of state support for&#13;
maintenance and renovation of the social assets. Work to be financed from these resources may&#13;
include wage payments to social asset workers, urgent rehabilitation of utility networks,&#13;
winterization of residential and communal buildings, repayment of debts to utilities, repairs to&#13;
health and education facilities, and the purchase of fuel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter II                                                                      11&#13;
2.13        In August 1996, the IAC will consider a report on completing the transfer of all&#13;
social assets from mines to local authorities to be prepared jointly by RosUgol and regional/local&#13;
authorities in coal basins.&#13;
2.14        Implementation of Social Safety Net Guidelines. This component will provide&#13;
assistance to design and assist with the implementation of the provision of the Coal SECAL for&#13;
social protection in 5 regions of the Russian Federation where mines will close. The delivery&#13;
of pre-redundancy counselling and mass layoff services in mines will be undertaken by the FES&#13;
through its network of regional and local offices. The FES has already developed a range of&#13;
programs and materials which would be of use in these activities. Two other major actions are&#13;
included as actions for tranche release in the SECAL : the Social Assets Operation and&#13;
Maintenance Program and the Community Support and Employment Programs in 5 towns in the&#13;
coal basins where mines are scheduled to close. As a matter of priority, a mechanism should&#13;
be designed to channel state financing to the five coal basins. The Terms of Reference for&#13;
consultancy services to design this mechanism, along with TA and training to the municipal&#13;
governments to strengthen management of social assets transferred from the coal companies, are&#13;
presented in Annex 5.&#13;
2.15        Pilot Activities for Community Suppoil and Employment Programs.  The&#13;
proposed Project would support implementation of pilot activities based on new mechanisms for&#13;
community support and employment programs in Kuzbass, Eastern Donbass, Pechora, Moscow&#13;
and Kisel coal basins. This would allow various stakeholders, notably community-based&#13;
organizations (CBOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the means of requesting&#13;
government support for new ideas. Existing CBO and NGO activity is as responsive as it can&#13;
be with limited funding and support. Background information on CBOs and NGOs are attached&#13;
(Annex 1). In enhancing the internal structures of the local groups, it is important that&#13;
community based programs and provision of services for which the groups were initially&#13;
established be supported. As a condition of disbursement for this component, the Borrower&#13;
would have to submit to the Bank the citeria applicable to the selection of the activities to be&#13;
carred out and the proposed implementation arrangements, both acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Subsidy Management&#13;
2.16        Recent improvements in subsidy management include the following:&#13;
(1)   a significant reduction in the levels of subsidies in real terms (from 1.4% of GDP&#13;
in 1993 to 0.4% of GDP in 1995);&#13;
(2)   demonopolization of RosUgol 's role in the allocation and distribution of subsidies.&#13;
Specifically, about 90% of the subsidies are currently distributed by the Treasury&#13;
Departments of the Federal and regional governments. Moreover, the Coal&#13;
Commission will start allocating quarterly subsidies (broken down on a monthly&#13;
basis) starting from the third quarter of 1996; and&#13;
(3)   increased transparency, reporting, monitoring and audits: according to the&#13;
"Regulation of the Mechanism of State Support to the Russian Coal Sector (May&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                                         Chapter nI&#13;
1996)", "state reporting of actual allocated amounts and results of their&#13;
utilization, regular audit, and publication of financial reports are introduced for&#13;
all levels (stages) of allocation and utilization of the state support funds".&#13;
2.17        TA on Subsidy Management. Consultancy services would be provided under the&#13;
Project to support the establishment of an improved computerized system for allocation,&#13;
reporting and monitoring of the subsidy management system, including recommendations for&#13;
improvements with respect to the following aspects: (i) contractual arrangements between the&#13;
primary recipients and ultimate recipients in subsidy management; and (ii) economic and social&#13;
indicators on the impact of subsidy uses. The draft Terms of Reference for TA on subsidy&#13;
management are attached in Annex 6.&#13;
2.18        In addition, as a follow up program to the diagnostic review to be carried out by&#13;
the auditor (para. 2.19), financial consultants would be mobilized to strengthen the financial&#13;
control of subsidies. While the above capacity building efforts may take time, recent progress&#13;
achieved in increased transparency and proposed auditing of significant subsidy recipients would&#13;
be conducive to positive behavioral changes toward financial accountability and discipline.&#13;
2.19        Audits. As part of the program  to enhance the transparency and financial&#13;
accountability in subsidy management, a special purpose audit on selected subsidy recipients for&#13;
the first six months of 1996 will start around July 1996. The implementation arrangements are&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   the IAC has compiled a list of five primary and ultimate recipients of the state&#13;
support which will be audited in 1996. Key criteria for selection of organizations&#13;
to be audited would include (i) the magnitude of subsidy received; and (ii)&#13;
diversity of organizations beyond the coal producing companies. The five&#13;
organizations are: RosUgol; RostovUgol; VorkutaUgol; AIK "Sokolovskaya" and&#13;
Kuzbasslnvestugol;&#13;
(b)   the Project Preparation Unit (PPU) will organize the tender for auditors with the&#13;
assistance of a PHRD-financed advisor.  The auditor should have a high&#13;
international reputation and comply with international auditing standards. The&#13;
Terms of Reference are attached in Annex 7. The auditing firm will be selected&#13;
on a competitive basis in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for selection of&#13;
consultants as well as for accounting, reporting and audit. Appointment of the&#13;
selected auditor is scheduled for July 1996. The audit fees would be financed&#13;
under the Bank loan; and&#13;
(c)   the auditor would conduct special purpose audits to verify the compliance with&#13;
Russian laws and regulations and review the internal control systems of the&#13;
subsidy recipients. Such a diagnostic review would be followed up by a second&#13;
phase technical assistance in strengthening the financial control of the subsidy&#13;
recipients. The audit report is scheduled to be submitted to the IAC by end-&#13;
October 1996. Submission of the above audit report to the Bank would be a&#13;
condition of second tranche release of the proposed Coal SECAL.&#13;
&#13;

Chapter II                                                                      13&#13;
Commercialization and Demonopolization of Coal Companies&#13;
2.20        The principles and guidelines of reforming the coal industry management system&#13;
are set out in "The Basic Trends of the Restructuring". Presidential Decree, No. 168, February&#13;
9, 1996, "On Measures to Improve the Structure of the Russian coal industry" is of paramount&#13;
importance for the implementation of the above principles and guidelines. In compliance with&#13;
the Decree, by end June 1996 the Government will convert the state company Rosugol into an&#13;
open joint-stock company.&#13;
2.21        By the end of October 1996 the Government will:&#13;
(a)   approve rules governing the trust management of state shares in coal companies,&#13;
including those covering appointment of new trust managers and their obligations&#13;
to the federal authorities;&#13;
(b)   transfer to the charter capital of these selected companies the state shares in&#13;
related companies, as envisaged in Presidential Decree no. 168; and&#13;
(c)   issue to potential bidders for trust management contracts for the selected&#13;
companies all of the information required by them for the preparation of their&#13;
bids.&#13;
2.22        Using this mechanism, by the end of December 1996 the Government will ensure&#13;
that new trust managers will control coal companies that produced in aggregate not less than 65&#13;
million tons of coal in 1995, i.e., approximately 25% of the volume of coal produced in the&#13;
Russian Federation.&#13;
2.23        Not later than three months after the competitive selection of trust managers of&#13;
state shares in the above-mentioned coal companies, the relevant Federal executive bodies will&#13;
review the business plans submitted by the new trust managers.&#13;
2.24        As far as other currently operating coal companies and joint-stock companies are&#13;
concerned, by end December 1996, the IAC will define measures to accelerate demonopolization&#13;
in the coal industry in 1997.&#13;
2.25        Preparation of Business Plans. Draft Governmental Decree on reorganization&#13;
of RosUgol into an open joint stock company stipulates that transferring state shares to the&#13;
charter capital of the coal companies should be implemented in the presence of business plans.&#13;
These plans would aim at creating profitable coal companies by means of closure of unprofitable&#13;
mines, labor efficiency increase and other measures. It is desirable that business plans include&#13;
feasibility studies of investments in coal mining or preparation. Starting from 1997, business&#13;
plan will be included in the agreements between leading and end recipients of the state support&#13;
as a necessary part of application for state support. Draft Terms of Reference for technical&#13;
assistance and training on the following aspects are presented in Annexes 8 - 11: (a) preparation&#13;
of Business Plans; (b) management/financial training; (c) trust management; and (d) measures&#13;
to attract external financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                                       Chapter II&#13;
C. PtOJECr ImPLEMENrATioN UNIT&#13;
2.26        Functions. The functions of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would include:&#13;
(a)   technical, informational and analytical assistance to the IAC;&#13;
(b)   assistance to the organization of independent coal companies, institutional reforms&#13;
in coal industry, development of entrepreneurship in coal mining regions;&#13;
(c)   monitoring of the mechanism of state support, development of the measures for&#13;
its improvement, development of the measures for its enhancement, organization&#13;
of audit of the recipients of the state support;&#13;
(d)   informing the coal industry workers and residents of the coal mining regions&#13;
about course of the restructuring;&#13;
(e)   comprehensive monitoring of the socioeconomic situation in coal mining regions,&#13;
assistance to the development of social partnership in coal mining regions;&#13;
(f)   development of the proposals concerning improvement of the system of social&#13;
protection of coal industry employees laid-off in connection with the&#13;
restructuring, members of their families, pensioners and disabled who worked in&#13;
coal industry proposals concerning development of social infrastructure of mining&#13;
communities;&#13;
(g)   development and implementation of the projects and programs financed by the&#13;
international and national organizations and funds;&#13;
(h)   assistance to attraction of the investments to the coal industry; and&#13;
(i)   educational and legal support to the restructuring of the coal industry.&#13;
2.27        Legal Form. The Foundation for Promotion of Restructuring the Coal Industry&#13;
(REFORMUGOL) would be established as the PIU in the form of a non-commercial foundation.&#13;
The founders would include the State Property Committee (GKI), Federal Center for Project&#13;
Finance and Association of Mining Cities. The Presidium of the Coal Commission would be&#13;
the Trustee Council overseeing the REFORMUGOL.&#13;
2.28        Organization and Management. The PIU will build upon the current Project&#13;
Preparation Unit (PPU) in terms of staffing and lessons learned. Staffing of PIU is expected to&#13;
be built up gradually, first with the appointment of the Director General, Director for subsidy&#13;
management as well as a deputy director to coordinate activities under the proposed Coal Sector&#13;
Restructuring Implementation Assistance Project. In addition, other key managers are expected&#13;
to be appointed shortly, including two directors to cover: (a) institutional support to the Coal&#13;
Commission; and (b) social monitoring and information on restructuring, respectively. The&#13;
charter of REFORMUGOL has been reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 11                                                                    15&#13;
Employment of the Director General of REFORMUGOL by the Trustee Council, with&#13;
qualfications and experence satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
2.29        In general, technical assistance and training activities under the Project will be&#13;
carried out by a partnership of foreign and local consultants, with a view to building up the&#13;
capacity of local consultants over time. Pilot activities for community support and employment&#13;
programs would include contracting with community based organizations (CBOs) and non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGOs) as implementing agencies, based on an operating procedure&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.  The implementation plan, including targeted beneficiaries and&#13;
implementation schedule, is presented in Schedule B. The Project would be implemented over&#13;
a three-year period. With a view to minimizing implementation delays, a procurement consultant&#13;
is being mobilized by the PIU to assist in key procurement activities under the Project.&#13;

COAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IMLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
m. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.1         The total project cost is estimated at about US$30.8 million, which about US$9.7&#13;
million (31 percent) is foreign exchange requirements. Grant financing, including funds from&#13;
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID; US$250,000) and the Policy&#13;
and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund under the Japanese Grant Facility (JGF;&#13;
US$425,000), as well as financing (US$2 million) from the Fund for Project Preparation [(FPP),&#13;
Portfolio Development Project, Ln 38440] would help finance urgently needed consultancy&#13;
services (including procurement, social assessment, public relations, design of community&#13;
support and employment programs, mine closure guidelines, development of a framework for&#13;
trust management and audits of subsidy recipients) and start-up costs of REFORMUGOL. The&#13;
Government of Russian Federation (GOR) would finance the taxes under the project and the rent&#13;
of REFORMUGOL (except for the first year rent which would be financed under the Bank&#13;
loan), totalling about US$3.1 million equivalent. The balance of the financing requirements,&#13;
US$25 million (81 percent), would be met by the proposed Bank loan.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.2         Under the Bank loan, provision is made for consultant services, training and&#13;
equipment and related services, including hardware and software to be procured in accordance&#13;
with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by the World Bank as Executing Agency,&#13;
published by the Bank in August 1981 (The Consultant Guidelines) and Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, published by the Bank in January 1995 (The&#13;
Guidelines). The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in the following table and&#13;
set out in detail in Schedule A.&#13;
3.3         Goods. To minimize the number of contracts and reduce unit costs, equipment and&#13;
materials to be financed under the Loan would be combined into substantial packages to the&#13;
extent practicable. However, the office equipment to be included under the project will be used&#13;
by a large number of different stakeholders in different regions of the country which are&#13;
participating in the implementation of the project. Consequently, there are practical limits to the&#13;
packaging of these contracts. Individual contract values estimated at under US$50,000 will be&#13;
procured through national shopping. Individual contract values estimated at above US$50,000&#13;
but less than US$300,000 will be procured through international shopping by comparing at least&#13;
3 quotations from two eligible countries, with the proviso that the aggregate amount of goods&#13;
procured through national shopping and international shopping may not exceed US$300,000 and&#13;
US$500,000, respectively.&#13;
3.4         Consulting Services and Training. Firms and individuals would be selected for&#13;
consultant assignments in accordance with the Bank's Consultants Guidelines. Consultant&#13;
assignments to be contracted for according to shortlisting procedures are estimated to total $16.4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                                          Chapter 3&#13;
million in approximately forty contracts. As far as practicable, the terms of reference will&#13;
combine a variety of related skills and services to increase the size and, therefore, the market&#13;
interest in each contract and reduce the number of contracts to be administered. The terms of&#13;
reference for all assignments would be subject to the Bank's prior review.&#13;
3.5            Stakeholders Support Services. Affected local governments as well as unique and&#13;
specialized organizations (trade unions, Association of Mining Cities, independent coal&#13;
companies and their association) will be contracted by the PIU to carry out participatory&#13;
activities in support of the coal restructuring program, based upon proposals and budgets&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, not exceeding US$400,000 per entity and US$ 1.6 million in the&#13;
aggregate.&#13;
3.6            Recurrent Cost: This would include salaries, utility services, office supplies and&#13;
rental of premises of PIU based upon an annual budget acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.7            Pilot Activities for Community  Support and Employment Programs: This&#13;
component would include a wide range of community-based activities, including but not limited&#13;
to PIU contracting with non-govemmental organizations (NGOs) and community based&#13;
organizations (CBOs) as implementing agencies, based on an operating procedure acceptable to&#13;
the Bank.&#13;

3.8         Bank Review. A project launch seminar is scheduled by July, 1996. The first two&#13;
contacts under international shopping and documentation for contracts valued at US$100,000 or&#13;
more for consultant firms, and at US$50,000 or more for individual consultants, all single source&#13;
contracts, all the proposals for stakeholders, annual budgets for recurrent costs and all plans&#13;
under the community based activity, would be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank.&#13;
All other contracts would be subject to ex-post reviews selectively.&#13;
3.9         Procurement Monitoring. Information on procurement would be collected and&#13;
recorded by the PIU to provide: (i) prompt reporting of contract awards by the Borrower; (ii)&#13;
full quarterly reports to the Bank; and (iii) changes in procurement schedules, including&#13;
advertising, bidding, contract awards and completion dates.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
3.10        The Bank would finance: (i) 100 percent of foreign expenditures of imported&#13;
goods, 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory costs) and 83 percent of costs of other items&#13;
obtained locally; (ii) 100 percent, excluding any taxes, of consultant services and agreed training&#13;
costs; and (iii) 100 percent of recurrent costs of the PIU, excluding taxes and rent, except for&#13;
the first year rent which would be financed by the Bank loan; and (iv) 83 percent of expenditures&#13;
of pilot activities of community support and employment programs. As a condition of&#13;
disbursement for the pilot activities for the community support and employment programs, the&#13;
Borrower would have to submit to the Bank the criteria applicable to the selection of the&#13;
ativities to be carnied out and the proposed implementation arrangements, both acceptable to&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
3.11        During the early stage of project implementation, the initial allocation of the&#13;
Special Account would be limited to US$250,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements&#13;
under the Loan have reached the level of US$ 1.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased&#13;
up to the authorized allocation of US$ 500,000 by submitting the relevant Application for&#13;
Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months, and&#13;
must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents. The&#13;
minimum application size for payments directly from the loan account or for issuance of Special&#13;
Commitments is 20% of the special account authorized allocation. Minimum application size&#13;
until aggregate disbursements reach US$1.0 million will be US$50,000; thereafter, it will be&#13;
US$100,000. Withdrawal applications will be fully documented, except for expenditures against&#13;
training and (a) goods and services of consulting firms under contracts not exceeding&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent; and (b) services of individual consultants under contracts not exceeding&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent which will be made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
detailing the individual transactions. Documentation supporting these expenditures will be held&#13;
by the PIU for at least one year after receipt of the audit report by the Bank for the year in&#13;
which the last disbursement is made and will be made available for review by the auditors and&#13;
to the Bank on request. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1998, with&#13;
a closing date for the loan on December 31, 1999.&#13;

IV. PROJECT ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL REPORTING AND AUDmNG&#13;
4.1         Accounting. REFORMUGOL would be responsible for the appropriate accounting&#13;
of the funds provided by the Bank under the Project, for reporting on the use of these funds and&#13;
for ensuring timely submission of audits of financial statements and reports to the Bank.&#13;
4.2         REFORMUGOL would establish an accounting system to provide information on&#13;
the proper receipt and use of funds furnished in accordance with the Loan Agreement.&#13;
Accounting for all Special Account transactions and all other project accounts will be maintained&#13;
in accordance with practices and standards satisfactory to the Bank, with the objective of timely&#13;
and accurate accounting of all transactions under the Project.&#13;
4.3         Financial Reporting. Financial reporting would be geared to the specific&#13;
requirements of the Project and would comprise a full statement of receipts and payments from&#13;
the project's inception. Reporting would be in accordance with disbursements classified and&#13;
reported under the expenditure categories agreed to by the Borrower and specified in the Loan&#13;
Agreement. The REFORMUGOL would submit quarterly financial progress reports, including&#13;
a separate report for the Special Account. A Project Completion Report would be submitted to&#13;
the Bank by the REFORMUGOL promptly after the conclusion of project activity, and in any&#13;
event not later than 6 months after the loan closing date.&#13;
4.4         Auditing. An assurance has been obtained that REFORMUGOL's financial&#13;
statements and project accounts, including the auditor's opinion on the use of the Special&#13;
Account and SOEs, would be audited in accordance with internationally accepted standards&#13;
by an independent auditingfirm, acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would be submitted&#13;
to the Bank no less than six months after the end of each fiscal year. In the case of SOEs, the&#13;
audit report would contain a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the SOEs submitted&#13;
during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their&#13;
preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals.&#13;

COAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IMLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
RusSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
STAKEHOLDERS' PARTICIPATION&#13;
Objectives of Participation&#13;
The proposed participation activities under the Project have the following objectives:&#13;
a)       provide miners, their families and communities with adequate and timely&#13;
information about the content of the coal sector reform program and its&#13;
implementation arrangements; maintain and strengthen support for the reform&#13;
program, both in the affected regions and in the country at large;&#13;
b)       provide miners with adequate information about their entitlements under&#13;
restructuring arrangements and mechanisms for legal recourse; ensure&#13;
transparency in implementation arrangements, help avoid discriminatory practices,&#13;
and support equitable treatment of all affected social groups (particularly&#13;
vulnerable groups such as the disabled);&#13;
c)       clarify the roles and responsibilities of local, regional and federal institutions in&#13;
reform implementation and delivering social safety services as defined by the&#13;
Coal Sector Restructuring Program, and enhance public's trust in these&#13;
institutions;&#13;
d)       facilitate participation of key stakeholders in decisions concerning the design and&#13;
implementation of sector reform; help strengthen the capacity of labor&#13;
organizations, NGOs and local institutions to ensure that the interests of miners,&#13;
their families and communities are adequately articulated and taken into account;&#13;
and&#13;
e)       build public support for restructuring one the most complex and socially-sensitive&#13;
sectors of the Russian economy.&#13;
Strategy for Pailicipation&#13;
2.    The general framework for participation strategy in support of the Coal Sector&#13;
Restructuring Program is outlined in the Social Assessment reports. The basic elements of this&#13;
strategy include:&#13;
a)    Information/communication support to the Program, focusing primarily on the&#13;
empowerment through information of the miners, their families and their&#13;
communities; support to institutions responsible for the provision of such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                                            Annex I&#13;
information, help clarify their roles and responsibilities; help enhance&#13;
transparency in reform implementation;&#13;
b)    Public communication to build and sustain a constituency for reform and help&#13;
broaden ownership of reform objectives; public and government relations support&#13;
for legislative changes that may be put in place to enhance geographical and job&#13;
mobility;&#13;
c)    Support to  consultative  local institutions representing  interests of key&#13;
stakeholders, in particular of miners and their communities; and&#13;
d)    Continuous social assessment and social impact monitoring to obtain feedback&#13;
from the most directly affected populations.&#13;
Stakeholder Participatory Activities and Public Communication Program&#13;
3.    Specific actions to support the objectives and general strategy of participation is presented&#13;
below in terms of institutional arrangements and include support to the following stakeholders:&#13;
(a)   Government's efforts to improve industrial relations in the coal sector;&#13;
(b)   Inter-Agency Coal Commission (Coal Commission, federal and regional levels);&#13;
(c)   Local governments and Association of Mining Cities;&#13;
(d)   Trade Unions; and&#13;
(e)   Independent coal companies and their Association.&#13;
4.    All support functions basically consist of having relevant stakeholders (e.g. unions,&#13;
municipalities) define their own program in the implementation of the coal sector reform.&#13;
Separately, as part of the assistance for social programs, the project would include&#13;
implementation of pilot activities for community support and employment programs mainly&#13;
through community based organizations (CBOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).&#13;
Background information on CBOs and NGOs is attached.&#13;
5.    In addition, the implementation of the coal sector restructuring program will be supported&#13;
by a public information and communication campaign. The main objectives of the campaign are:&#13;
a) familiarizing respective stakeholders and public at large with the coal restructuring program&#13;
and its subsequent stages of implementation; b) sharing experiences with coal sector reform&#13;
programs in other countries; c) providing information on costs and benefits of restructuring; d)&#13;
making public the mechanisms for subsidy allocations and the implications of these allocations;&#13;
e) pointing to need for legislative and regulatory support to the restructuring program; and f)&#13;
building public support for the restructuring program.&#13;
Suppotifor Government's Effoits to Improve Industrial Relations in the Coal Sector&#13;
6.    Market oriented industrial relations will require increased attention from Government,&#13;
management and labor if the coal sector is to adequately respond to and support the restructuring&#13;
process. The current basis for industrial relations in Russian coal are two Tariff Agreements,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1                                                                             25&#13;
"bargained" approximately every two years among each trade union, MOFE and MOL. The IAC&#13;
has directed that the agreements be abolished in 1997, leaving huge gaps at all levels in terms&#13;
of contracts, worker-manager relations and a working system of industrial relations.&#13;
7.    The singular tool now used to enforce these agreements, which affects wages, health and&#13;
safety and various benefits, is the strike. It is necessary that a system of industrial relations&#13;
commence, and to support this relatively new and evolving social partnership, a series of rapid&#13;
responses are proposed to be put in place with the goal of strengthening already existing&#13;
structures and addressing gaps which now exist.&#13;
8.    This subcomponent, which includes strengthening the role of the Government, would be&#13;
complemented by separate project subcomponents: (a) support to trade unions; and (b) assistance&#13;
to managers of coal companies with preparation of business plans. The key areas addressed&#13;
under this project subcomponent are summarized below. The draft TOR for consultancy services&#13;
is attached.&#13;
(i)    Collective Bargaining: While collective bargaining is to some extent conducted&#13;
at the coal enterprise level, there remain huge gaps in information exchange and&#13;
distribution as well as mechanisms for enforcing collective bargaining agreements&#13;
at all levels. Collective bargaining is an inherent part of a market coal structure&#13;
which will have a pivotal role in the effective operation of the coal sector.&#13;
Application of international experience as it pertains will be useful.&#13;
(ii)   Conflict Resolution/Negotiation: A combined approach to building reliable&#13;
mechanisms and enforcement of negotiations being proposed:&#13;
a.    improve existing mechanisms of negotiation and resolution including&#13;
contract negotiations outside of collective bargaining, mediation,&#13;
dispute/conflict resolution and information distribution on the rights and&#13;
responsibilities of parties.&#13;
b.    provide training on mediation for currently existing structures in addition&#13;
to preparation of materials.&#13;
c.    develop and support independent mediation services.&#13;
(iii)  Labor Law: Support to lawyers representing parties as well as to trade unions,&#13;
management and where necessary, government, in enhancing the information&#13;
about the use of the current legal system to improve the legal basis and quality&#13;
of industrial relations. Further, to work with the parties and relevant legislatures&#13;
in identifying and developing recommendations for laws which will better support&#13;
and facilitate the sector's industrial relations.&#13;
(iv)   Role of the Government: As market reforms continue, the role of federal, regional&#13;
and local government as they relate to industry development, will necessarily&#13;
change. In particular, as the coal sector moves toward decreasing state financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                                                                           Annex I&#13;
and regionalization, the role of the federal government, as in coal sectors&#13;
worldwide, will become more regulatory in nature. Proposed support to&#13;
government will include assistance to the following key participants:&#13;
(a)   Ministry of Labor, in its enhanced role as government mediator over&#13;
labor disputes and as an avenue for enforcement of labor law and practice.&#13;
Support to the federal and regional offices is important to evolving&#13;
relations between industry and government;&#13;
(b)   The Duma, in their addressing worker and manager rights and&#13;
responsibilities, privatization and industry development. This would&#13;
contribute to the timely development of relevant and enforceable law; and&#13;
(c)   Ministry of Fuel and Energy, in its growing role in the regulation and&#13;
enforcement of health and safety aspects of coal mining, as well as&#13;
government policy on coal taxes, duties, and exports.&#13;
(v)   Exposure to International Experience: Training in Russia on the above-mentioned&#13;
topics will be complemented by participation of workers, managers and&#13;
government representatives in relevant specialized fora such as the International&#13;
Labor Organization (ILO), International Mining Federation, and International&#13;
Coal Export Committees. International participation will permit manager, worker&#13;
and government participants to view first hand, the effects of industrial relations&#13;
to coal sector development.&#13;
9.    Information, training, education materials and program development will require both&#13;
local and international experience. This combination of elements, centered on training, will assist&#13;
the Russian coal industry in making the difficult transition to a regulated market system. The&#13;
proposed program above has been designed to allow for an oversight organization to implement&#13;
its various components which are crucial to building an enduring industrial relations structure.&#13;
This oversight will ensure regional coordination and responsive programming particular to&#13;
involved parties.&#13;
10.   The foundation of any industrial relations system  requires an open exchange of&#13;
information amongst parties. In order to facilitate this important exchange, round tables,&#13;
video/audio taping of training seminars, improving dissemination on government decisions and&#13;
other relevant information will all be parts of program components listed above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1                                                                            27&#13;
Suppoit to the Inter-Agency Coal Commission (IAC)&#13;
11.   Under this project, institutional support would be provided to facilitate the operations of&#13;
the IAC both at the federal and regional levels though strengthening the administrative capacity&#13;
of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). At this point in restructuring, the offices of the IAC&#13;
are seen as the basis for regional reform in the coal communities. This would include:&#13;
(i)    Facilitating the Operations of the UC. Currently, the IAC lacks an office and&#13;
other basic communication facilities. This makes it difficult for it to receive&#13;
feedback. During reform implementation, this will also create problems in&#13;
Commission's outreach to the regions. One of the functions of the PIU is to&#13;
provide technical, informational and analytical assistance to the IAC. For this&#13;
purpose, the staffing plan of the PIU includes a Director and two staff to provide&#13;
the necessary support to the IAC; and&#13;
(ii)   Supporting IAC's Work at the Regional Levels. The development of social&#13;
partnership mechanisms of various groups of residents in coal regions whose&#13;
interests are directly affected by restructuring of coal industry will be carried out&#13;
by enhancing existing regional Coal Commissions as well as setting up similar&#13;
commissions in coal regions where they have not yet been established. Regional&#13;
Coal Commissions will be set up in all coal regions before January 1, 1997. The&#13;
proposed support for the IAC at the regional levels would be achieved in a cost&#13;
effective manner through focus on about five coal regions. Starting in five main&#13;
coal regions, the PIU would set up a small office (in coordination with the&#13;
regional administration) with 1-2 staff to (a) support the work of the IAC and its&#13;
regional offices; (b) provide regular feedback from the regions to the IAC; (c)&#13;
distribute information, including steps taken and to be taken during restructuring&#13;
by Government; (d) work with regional and local press in accessing up-to-date&#13;
information on the restructuring process; and (e) coordinate with the local&#13;
administration and trade unions.&#13;
Support to Local Governments&#13;
12.   At the local levels of mining communities, oversight committees would be formed under&#13;
the leadership of the heads of local administrations and consist of representatives of various&#13;
groups affected by the restructuring program. The main objective of the local oversight&#13;
committees will be to determine the strategy for local development, coordination of the&#13;
development and implementation of local development programs, dissemination of timely and&#13;
accurate information on restructuring, and monitoring and supporting access to social protection&#13;
for laid-off workers and residents of mining communities.&#13;
13.   Local oversight committees will determine the guidelines for the disbursement of state&#13;
financing allocated to finance local development programs. In mid-1996, local oversight&#13;
committees will be formed in five pilot mining towns of largest coal-mining regions. Special&#13;
working groups will be set up under the leadership of the regional administrations to provide the&#13;
necessary organizational support and technical assistance for community support and employment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                                    Annex 1&#13;
programs (Annex 4). It is envisaged that by 1997, local oversight committees will be established&#13;
in about 30 mining communities.&#13;
Suppoi1 to the Association of Mining Cities&#13;
14.   This will consist of financing of periodic (approximately once every 4-6 months) meeting&#13;
of mayors -- at least mayors in the major coal regions; regular provision of information to&#13;
mayors through Regional Coal Commissions; as well as provision of specific information, know-&#13;
how and expertise required by the mayors.Y'&#13;
15.   Further, mayors may wish to (a) invite their counterparts from other countries who have&#13;
had similar experience to share their experiences; and (b) learn more about subjects such as&#13;
management issues and micro enterprise development. It may also be useful to maintain working&#13;
ties with the media at the local level as an additional tool for communicating the work of the&#13;
Association within the coal communities.&#13;
Support to Trade Unions:&#13;
(i)    Support to information/communication activities: Trade Unions undertake&#13;
many outreach activities to keep workers informed of various sector issues,&#13;
including tariff agreements and problems concerning their implementation,&#13;
notably health and safety issues. The outreach materials are not always prepared&#13;
in a professional way; enhancement of the preparation and dissemination of user&#13;
friendly information can help miners and bring greater transparency to sector&#13;
operations.&#13;
(ii)    Support to Trade Union Social Impact Monitoring activities: Unions have&#13;
regional monitoring activities focusing on employees within the sector. These&#13;
activities could provide complementary information to social impact monitoring&#13;
activities proposed under the proposed Project. The collaboration between the&#13;
Advisory Panel of Scientists proposed for "independent" social impact assessment&#13;
activities, PIU and the trade unions would also help strengthen unions' capacity&#13;
for impact monitoring and participation.&#13;
(iii)   Support to improvements in the quality of legal counseling available to&#13;
miners: Labor Law is a recently developing field and the unions express&#13;
particular difficulties in identifying lawyers knowledgeable with a whole range of&#13;
I'    The Network could remain as an ad hoc voluntary association without having to have a formal status.&#13;
Similar Networks or Unions of Mayors exists in other countries. Examples of the constitutions or operating&#13;
principles of such Networks are available. The Network may have its own structure, including a rotating&#13;
president and secretariat. The Ministry of Economy, through the PIU, may serve as the technical secretariat,&#13;
financing the meetings of the Mayors, facilitating their communications, and providing information and training&#13;
to municipalities as specific by the Network. in other words, the technical secretariat -PIU-- could disperse&#13;
funds allocated for support of the Network in accordance with the decisions of the Network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1                                                                         29&#13;
legal skills, including mediation and negotiation skills, disability compensation,&#13;
etc. The quality of the legal support is not only important to protect the workers&#13;
who may be made redundant, but also are important for the restructured and&#13;
strengthened parts of the industry.&#13;
(iv)   Support to Trade Union research on social issues: There are a number of social&#13;
issues on which trade unions propose to do research. These include problems of&#13;
migrant workers, sources of conflicts, alternative mechanisms of placement of&#13;
redundant workers. Supporting the capacity of labor organizations to undertake&#13;
policy research and monitoring could contribute to the sustainability of the reform&#13;
effort.&#13;
(v)   Support to training and coalition building activities: This activity is addressed&#13;
under industrial relations. It is shown here as a participation activity as it would&#13;
help enhance collaboration between the coal industry managers and labor&#13;
representatives and thus improve the working conditions of employees.&#13;
Suppoil to the Independent Coal Companies&#13;
16.   A number of coal companies are becoming independent and they need support to network&#13;
among themselves, acquire new business skills and expand their markets. Under this project,&#13;
support would be provided to them along lines to be specified by these companies themselves.&#13;
It is envisioned that such demand will consist of facilitation of their networking through regional&#13;
meetings, workshops and training.&#13;
Public Infonnation and Communication Campaign&#13;
17.   While information exchange amongst some twenty-five federal agencies has been largely&#13;
facilitated by the IAC, the systematic provision of consistent and region-specific information to&#13;
other stakeholders and the miners' community, in particular, has been lacking. The miners&#13;
currently obtain information on the coal restructuring program from three main sources: (a) mine&#13;
management, (b) local trade union organizations and (c) local and federal mass media. At a time&#13;
of increasing difficulties in the sector, timely provision of comprehensive and consistent&#13;
information throughout the entire implementation period of the restructuring Program will be&#13;
crucial. In particular, incomplete, contradictory or out-dated information would, in turn, lead&#13;
to speculation and misinformation and thus deepening the communities' anxiety about their&#13;
future. An information vacuum would also undermine the credibility of the reform efforts and&#13;
weaken public support for the Government's restructuring program.&#13;
18.  In order to address this issue, the proposed project includes the organization of a&#13;
comprehensive media-based public information and communication program. This component&#13;
is essential for creation of trust in the system at large and in the individual institutions charged&#13;
with providing support to miners and their communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                                             Annex 1&#13;
19.   The communication campaign will consist of the following components:&#13;
(i)   Continuous monitoring and assessing information needs of respective stakeholder&#13;
groups. This element of the campaign will draw heavily on the findings conducted&#13;
under social assessment and social impact monitoring activities. Additional assessment&#13;
of information needs will be acquired through the monitoring of local and federal&#13;
media (newspaper clippings service and electronic media monitoring), direct&#13;
interactions of campaign coordinators with stakeholders and, in cases where informa-&#13;
tion is still insufficient, conducting small-scale opinion research surveys.&#13;
(ii)  Preparation of information material and its regular up-date throughout subsequent&#13;
stages on the reform program. The material should cover a broad spectrum of issues&#13;
in which the mining communities and other stakeholders are interested (e.g., specific&#13;
steps being taken by the Government to implement plans for coal restructuring; the&#13;
mechanisms, categories and amounts of subsidies being distributed to the sector and&#13;
their implications; the rights and responsibilities of workers and managers during&#13;
restructuring; contacts regarding the application for and receipt of benefits and social&#13;
programs). This component includes preparation of substantive information on issues&#13;
of country-wide concern as well as stakeholder-specific issues. It is crucial that the&#13;
information is prepared timely and in an audience-friendly way.&#13;
(iii) Building up effective dissemination and communication channels: establishing an&#13;
information network of contact persons capable of reaching out to the coal regions and&#13;
the stakeholders. This component also includes identification of a group of "talking&#13;
heads" -- key players with extensive knowledge about the reform program who would&#13;
serve as 'messengers" -- and providing them with basic media training. Lastly, this&#13;
component includes strengthening institutions which already perform information&#13;
dissemination activities (local trade union organizations, oblast and city press&#13;
services).&#13;
(iv)  Timely dissemination of information and communication activities conducted at both&#13;
the federal and regional levels. The exact choice and character of activities will have&#13;
to be determined by the campaign organizers in a way tailored to the specific informa-&#13;
tion needs of the given stakeholder and region. In general, these activities will include:&#13;
o   interactions with mass media -- building up a database of key national and&#13;
regional mass media organizations; handling media queries and providing&#13;
them with information as it emerges;&#13;
o pro-active measures vis-a-vis the national and local mass media, such as&#13;
contributions to regular newspaper columns in major coal region newspapers,&#13;
the organization of press tours, setting up interviews with key players and&#13;
enhancing their participation in relevant TV and radio shows, and providing&#13;
relevant footage to TV stations;&#13;
o   launching a monthly information bulletin and its wide circulation among all&#13;
stakeholders;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1                                                                            31&#13;
o   an on-going distribution of pamphlet materials covering issues on "legal&#13;
benefits for laid-off workers", "stages of restructuring and results", "job&#13;
creation issues", etc.; the broad dissemination of other high-quality written&#13;
materials produced on an ad hoc basis (minutes from important meetings,&#13;
reports on coal restructuring operations in other countries, etc.);&#13;
o   visits to the regions/mines and locally-held briefings (road shows);&#13;
o   national press conferences and media coverage organized around major&#13;
events, including meetings of the Network of Mayors;&#13;
o   information seminars for a specific group of stakeholders;&#13;
o   informal interactions with key representatives of various stakeholder groups.&#13;
(v)   Providing institutional support to ensure the sustainability of the information activities in&#13;
the long-term. Specific implementation plans of the above components should keep in mind&#13;
the campaign's sustainability throughout the entire implementation of coal sector&#13;
restructuring in the Russian Federation, and thus its continuation after completion of the&#13;
World Bank-supported project.&#13;
(vi) Collecting evidence on the local implementation of reforms. Receiving feedback from the&#13;
coal regions and sharing this feedback with other stakeholders will also be important in&#13;
monitoring the implementation of coal sector reforms.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
20.   The proposed institutional arrangements for the implementation of support for key&#13;
stakeholders, including trade unions, Association of Mining Cities and independent coal companies&#13;
are summarized below. Each contract signed between the PIU and the implementation entity will&#13;
specify the work program, manner of payments, evaluation, monitoring, reports and auditing.&#13;
a)    All support to the IAC and Regional Coal Commissions would be provided directly&#13;
by the PIU.&#13;
b)    Support to various stakeholders, including local governments and the Association of&#13;
Mayors of Coal Mining Cities, trade unions and independent coal companies, would&#13;
be based on their submission of detailed proposals consistent with criteria and&#13;
procedures stipulated by the PIU. This type of support would be in the form of a&#13;
service contract with the PIU. Each recipient will be required (as appropriate) to&#13;
provide to the PIU: (i) regular progress reports on activities; (ii) a mid-term report&#13;
on progress towards achieving the objectives of the program; and (iii) a final report&#13;
and audited statements of expenses incurred.&#13;
c)    Public information and communication program will be coordinated by a company&#13;
with an established track record in public communication. The company will be&#13;
selected through competitive bidding and its activities will be overseen by the PIU.&#13;

AUtachment 1&#13;
BACKGROUND ON CBOS AND NGOS&#13;
1.    introduction. In the wake of coal sector restructuring, much of the onus of social and&#13;
economic support to coal communities is being shifted from the federal levels of government to&#13;
regional and local governmental, non-governmental (NGOs), and community based organizations&#13;
(CBOs). Both NGOs and CBOs in the coal regions have inevitably begun to identify gaps in social&#13;
support services and community development areas formerly addressed by govemment or industry&#13;
and have been responsive in developing local programs which minimize the negative effects of&#13;
restructuring.&#13;
2.    Community Based Organizations. CBOs have always played an important role in Russia's&#13;
coal communities and during the transition toward market economics, have begun to play a marked&#13;
role in the development and redevelopment of most coal communities. In fact, CBO activity in coal&#13;
regions of Russia has, by virtue of its inherently local nature, been more responsive to community&#13;
needs and engaged in coal community development than traditional NGO activity.&#13;
3.    CBOs now functioning in most coal communities with minimal support and infrastructure,&#13;
but nonetheless providing needed services include women, veteran, disabled, and youth support&#13;
groups. More specific CBOs have evolved in certain regions where they focus on region-specific&#13;
issues such as "relocation" (Pechora) or "health related" (Kisel) issues.&#13;
4.    The current base of CBO activities in coal communities is a focus on social issues including&#13;
job retraining, financial and material support during transition, and distribution of information.&#13;
5.    Non-Government Organizations. During the former Soviet period, "NGO-like" activities&#13;
went on, but did not receive full legal or economic support from government or citizenry. Since&#13;
1992, various national and international NGO activities have commenced activity in Russia's coal&#13;
regions. While various obstacles which existed for certain NGO activity prior to 1992 (eg. lack of&#13;
legal foundations, closed cities) no longer exist, the sector is still very new and there is a need for&#13;
increased support through adequate funding.&#13;
6.    It is important to note that "NGO" activity in Russia's coal regions has not necessarily been&#13;
strictly without government support or funding. The reality of these regions is that local donations&#13;
and support do not adequately meet the needs of an NGO and that while the activities carried are&#13;
"NGO-like", it has often been local and regional govemment support which maintains these activities.&#13;
With enhanced communication, awareness and access to the regions, NGO work now ongoing in&#13;
other regions of Russia will likely focus more attention in these areas, many of which are fairly&#13;
isolated.&#13;
7.    Upon review of the local activity now ongoing in the coal communities of Russia, the need&#13;
for such community based and non-government activity is not in question, however, financial support&#13;
for these structures is inadequate. At a time when local and regional government and industry&#13;
resources are being redirected within new market parameters, the CBO and NGO networks will play&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1                                                                             33&#13;
a more important role in delivering timely and effective response to the needs for community&#13;
development and support aspects earlier overseen by government and industry.&#13;
8.    Pflot Activities for Community Support and Employment Programs. The proposed Project&#13;
would support implementation of pilot activities based on new mechanisms for community support&#13;
and employment programs in Kuzbass, Eastern Donbass, Pechora, Moscow and Kisel coal basins.&#13;
This would allow various stakeholders, notably CBOs and NGOs, the means of requesting&#13;
government support for new ideas.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
COAL SECTOR RESTRUCTuRiNG IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS: DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Until 1992, the Soviet centralized economic system minimized the interaction of the key&#13;
participants, namely labor, management and government. Since then, transition to market economics&#13;
has shown the importance of these relations to the development and maintenance of a viable coal&#13;
sector in Russia. Plagued by strikes, lack of predictability and rising tensions amongst all parties, a&#13;
new market-oriented approach to industrial relations in the Russian coal sector must be taken.&#13;
2.    As the sector attempts to restructure, the urgency of improved industrial relations has&#13;
increased. At present, the basis of industrial relations in Russian coal are two national "Tariff&#13;
Agreements" among the two coal trade unions and the Ministries of Fuel and Energy, and Labor.&#13;
The sole tool for enforcing these agreements and for enforcing worker-manager responsibilities is the&#13;
strike. Support from various industry representatives during this transition period is vital. Unless a&#13;
workable system of industrial relations is in place, international experience has shown that a viable&#13;
market-oriented coal sector cannot develop.&#13;
Government Policy on Social Partnership&#13;
3.    As evidenced by the Inter-Agency Coal Commission, there are over twenty government&#13;
ministries, agencies or organizations which are to some extent involved in the restructuring of Russian&#13;
coal. Each government structure will play a critical role in receiving and distributing important&#13;
information as to how that government structure is responding and initiating restructuring efforts.&#13;
4.    The Russian government has stated that it is firmly committed to the theory and practice of&#13;
"social partnership," a principle on par with that of industrial relations. The Government will play&#13;
a major role in enhancing social partnership as it affects coal communities, while an even more&#13;
focused approach to enhancing, if not developing, industrial relations, must be taken by industry and&#13;
union leaders with the support of government.&#13;
5.    The Government considers social partnership mechanisms are the basis of interaction and&#13;
information exchange amongst participants in the process of restructuring the coal industry. The&#13;
Russian Government has also committed itself to considering ways of ending its involvement with&#13;
the Tariff Agreement process by the end of 1997.&#13;
6.    As for implementation of the coal restructuring program, the Russian Government is&#13;
establishing regional Coal Commission contact offices: by setting up such bodies in coal regions&#13;
where they have not yet been set up. Local oversight committees are also to be formed, consisting&#13;
of representatives of various affected groups, including trade unions. The main objective of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                                            Annex 2&#13;
oversight committees will be to determine the strategy coordination and implementation of local&#13;
development programs, and the social protection of laid-off workers and residents of mining&#13;
development programs.&#13;
7.    The Russian government is also committed to provide technical support to the work of the&#13;
regional Coal Commissions; monitoring of state financing mechanisms, including independent audits;&#13;
and multi-faceted monitoring of the social and economic situation in the coal regions. In the&#13;
informational sphere, the Russian government will provide coal industry workers with information&#13;
on relevant programs; will strengthen local organizations which work with miners to improve their&#13;
legal and social protection; and will monitor the restructuring of the coal industry and make these&#13;
results public through the local media.&#13;
Govemment's Role in Industral Relations&#13;
8.    The current reality of the Russian government's role in coal restructuring is federal-oriented.&#13;
During this transition period as the regional authorities and industry managers adapt to more market-&#13;
oriented roles in sector development, it will become necessary for the role of federal government to&#13;
similarly transition. International coal country experience demonstrates repeatedly the need for federal&#13;
regulation and enforcement of sector practice on health and safety, legislation, tax and duties, and&#13;
where applicable, management of state shares.&#13;
a)    Ministry of Fuel and Energy - The Russian government has proposed that MOFE&#13;
should be a signatory to labor contracts and undertake an enhanced role in the&#13;
regulation and enforcement of health and safety aspects in the coal sector. It is&#13;
important that MOFE be supported during this transitional period to effectuate the&#13;
establishment of sound industrial relations.&#13;
As the transition continues, a more regulatory role in the oversight of health and&#13;
safety at coal enterprises will be crucial.&#13;
b)    Ministry of Labor - MOL has created a new department "Social Partnership" in&#13;
which it seeks to create a more enduring government location for the oversight of&#13;
industrial relations in various sectors. The Ministry of Labor is also involved in&#13;
mediation and conflict resolution activities, although these activities are minimal and&#13;
lack local respect . The Ministry maintains regional offices in the coal regions and in&#13;
time, with the proper training and support, should evolve as a stronger government&#13;
structure to support industrial relations as they concern the coal sector.&#13;
c)    Duma - Support to legislators in developing effective legislation at the federal and&#13;
local levels will be important as industrial relations continues to evolve as the basis&#13;
on which sector development will be practicable. Absent legislation which encourages&#13;
this foundation, the long-term development of the sector will be delayed.&#13;
9.    While it is similarly important that participants and labor lawyers are well versed in&#13;
supporting legislation, the crux of sector policy and industrial relations will be based on well drafted&#13;
law which has reliable mechanisms for enforcement and government support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2                                                                              37&#13;
Management's Role in Industrial Relations&#13;
10.   In virtually all sectors of the Russian economy, management skills are lacking; this attributed&#13;
to the former State control and central system which required little or regulated contribution to the&#13;
system from its managers at all levels. Now, as State control lessens and financial attachment to the&#13;
government decreases as well, it is vitally important that managers of industry receive proper and&#13;
timely training to respond effectively to the rapidly changing industry structure.&#13;
11.   Industry managers must now address issues of organizational structure, financial management,&#13;
personnel and inter and intra-industry relations with an eye toward establishing profit-bearing&#13;
enterprises and a secure place in the market; the development of skills to enhance regional and local&#13;
managerial capabilities to adequately address these issues is crucial.&#13;
12.   In addition to basic management skills for managers of the coal sector which are addressed&#13;
under Business Plans, Management Training herein, union leaders will also require such basic&#13;
training. Furthermore, included in Management Training issues of Fair Labor Practices and Labor&#13;
Law will need to be addressed.&#13;
Labor's Role in Industrial Relations&#13;
13.   Just as the role of government and management has and continues to change during the coal&#13;
sector's evolution toward a market system, so too must the tools and structures used by labor change.&#13;
Virtually all coal sector workers hold membership in one of the sector's two trade unions; the unions&#13;
have very different histories, goals and approaches to coal sector reform. Industrial relations is an&#13;
area of inevitable common ground for the two unions and despite extreme political differences, the&#13;
two unions will need to develop methods for working or at least learning together.&#13;
14.   At present, the singular tool used by workers to enforce worker rights is the strike. This tool&#13;
is used to demand wages, better living conditions, enhanced health and safety and even political calls.&#13;
The unions, in conjunction with management and government, have not fared well in attempt to&#13;
negotiate and mediate various claims. A weak legal system at the local levels coupled with threats&#13;
of job loss have provided large barriers to alternative approaches to resolving conflict.&#13;
Approach&#13;
15.   Two phases to the Industrial Relations work will be necessary; the second phase will depend&#13;
upon funding and interest in pursuing this sector specific effort.&#13;
Phase 1. This will include coordination with the PIU, unions, management structures and&#13;
government representatives in establishing 10 mine-level "Education Centers";&#13;
0     4 centers at mines in Kuzbass&#13;
2 centers at mines in Rostov&#13;
2 centers at mines in Vorkuta&#13;
2 centers at mines in the Urals&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                                                                Annex 2&#13;
*     identification, in coordination with PIU, Education Coordinators at ten mines&#13;
*     training of Education Coordinators based at the mine in:&#13;
*0.   labor - management relations&#13;
*.   atrain the trainers&#13;
*0.    negotiating&#13;
*1.    collective bargaining&#13;
*.    social benefits for laid off workers&#13;
*.    conflict resolution&#13;
*     ongoing presentation of seminars on above topics at the ten selected mines; training&#13;
will benefit from a combined local/international experience using existing structures&#13;
at the local level with various consultant input.&#13;
Phase 2. This will include:&#13;
*     enhanced training to the Education Coordinators to include:&#13;
*.    drafting legislation&#13;
IN.    use of informational tools in enhancing industrial relations (eg. newsletters)&#13;
*     using Education Centers at the mines, provide training to already existing structures&#13;
requiring more information:&#13;
-0.    Labor Lawyers&#13;
Arbitration Services&#13;
Ministry of Labor representatives&#13;
IN.    Mediation/Conciliation Centers&#13;
-     presentation of seminar where all Education Center Coordinators, local counterparts&#13;
and international guests will come together to review and discuss the current status&#13;
of industrial relations in Russian coal and what steps need to be taken.&#13;
*     one-to-one consultation with Ministry of Fuel and Energy, Ministry of Labor and&#13;
Duma representatives; ideally, a consultant counterpart who will work directly with&#13;
the Government counterpart in developing relevant materials, providing information&#13;
to labor, management and other government bodies, and designing a plan by which&#13;
the institution will support the enhancement of a coal industrial relations system.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
16.   Phase 1 will comprise:&#13;
Task 1: In cooperation with the Inter-Agency Coal Commission and PIU, select mines in&#13;
each of the four above-referenced coal regions wherean Education Center will be established.&#13;
Management and both unions should participate in selection of site and set up of operations.&#13;
Task 2: Select Education Coordinators, one from each mine, who coordinate and ultimate&#13;
conduct training activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2                                                                          39&#13;
Task 3: Design and implement a system of selecting training participants at the mine as well&#13;
as representatives from the regional industry level and government where applicable to&#13;
address:&#13;
*     Collective Bargaining&#13;
*     Dispute Resolution&#13;
*     Labor-Management Relations&#13;
*     Labor Law&#13;
*     Negotiating&#13;
*     Social Benefits to Laid-off Workers&#13;
Task 4: Design general curriculum and training materials on topics including:&#13;
a)    Collective Bargaining - on-going, specific work at the mine level in designing and&#13;
developing a collective bargaining agreement which will be recognized by the relevant&#13;
parties;&#13;
b)    Dispute Resolution - on-going skills training in negotiating, conflict management and&#13;
dispute resolution; activities will include mine participants and relevant govemment&#13;
representatives;&#13;
c)    Labor-Management Relations - on-going distribution of information on intemational&#13;
experience as well as methods to improve these relations in the context of a coal&#13;
enterprise;&#13;
d)    Labor Law - mine parficipants as well as local lawyers will receive informational and&#13;
"know-how" training on the current status of labor law vis a vis Russian coal&#13;
enterprises and methods for improving such laws. Each of the five mining regions&#13;
will produce a specific analysis of the local status of labor law.&#13;
e)    Negotiating - basic negotiating skills and tactics may be taught and practiced; role&#13;
playing is already a successful method of training used in various union training.&#13;
Managers and worker representatives will practically apply skills acquired in&#13;
negotiating new collective bargaining agreements as well as individual contracts.&#13;
f)    Social Benefits to Laid-Off Workers - in light of ongoing restructuring, an educated&#13;
workforce will benefit in knowing to what benefits it is entitled and how to obtain&#13;
such benefits. The current lack of knowledge on this aspect of restructuring is proving&#13;
to hamper the process at all levels and is counter to good industrial relations where&#13;
an open flow of information must be achieved.&#13;
Task 5: A combined training approach will involve local and foreign consultants; initially&#13;
centered on broad participation, followed with specific training for local Education&#13;
Coordinators.&#13;
a)    Develop a training calendar, planned by topic for the needs of each specific mine.&#13;
b)    Calendar should include a combination of local mine training and focused "trainer"&#13;
training; the ten Education Coordinators may receive simultaneous angalones&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                                                                             Annex 2&#13;
Task 6: Develop training materials also suitable for distribution beyond the ten mines in&#13;
which training activity is focused. Such materials will include study-assignment books and&#13;
local contact information on industrial relations.&#13;
Task 7: Select local part-time Information Coordinators to oversee the distribution to the local&#13;
media in each of the four coal regions of information about the local training activities as well&#13;
as the national coal restructuring program. These individuals at the mine level will work&#13;
closely with any other regional or local contact office.&#13;
Task 8: Regular information on the local training program and on the mine restructuring&#13;
program will be provided by the local Information Coordinator to local print and electronic&#13;
media in the four regions.&#13;
Task 9: Data base of sample selected collective bargaining provisions of the five designated&#13;
mines will be provided by the Education Coordinators and relevant members of the local&#13;
training group.&#13;
Task 10: In conjunction with the above tasks, where applicable, specific training will be&#13;
provided to specific constituencies including local labor lawyers and appropriate government&#13;
officials, including from the Ministries of Fuel and Energy and Labor.&#13;
Task 11: An ongoing assessment of the status of labor-management-government relations in&#13;
each region, as well as the local NGO/CBO sector and institutes which impact on industrial&#13;
relations at the coal mines should be conducted.&#13;
17.   Phase 2 will comprise:&#13;
a. Focus on Government&#13;
Task 1: Two Industrial Relations Specialists and a Russian Labor Lawyer will be selected.&#13;
It is highly probable that the two industrial relations specialists will be former Education&#13;
Coordinators trained during Phase 1.&#13;
Task 2: The Industrial Relations Specialists will perform advisory work with the relevant&#13;
sections in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the Ministry of Labor on par with what&#13;
training was presented during Phase 1.&#13;
Task 3: Detailed written recommendations to the relevant agency will be provided by each&#13;
Industrial Relations Specialist. Foreign and local consultants may work together to discem&#13;
what effective market tools are applicable.&#13;
Task 4: The Russian Labor Lawyer will perform consultations with the relevant committees&#13;
of the Duma.&#13;
Task 5: Detailed written recommendations on draft labor law and enforcement mechanisms&#13;
will be provided to the relevant Duma committees by the Russian Labor Lawyer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2                                                                            41&#13;
Task 6: The Labor Lawyer, in coordination with relevant local training participants, will&#13;
provide a detailed written analysis of relevant labor laws and their enforcement mechiams&#13;
and practices for possible future distribution.&#13;
b. Focus on Labor-Management Relations&#13;
Task 7: Using the Education Centers, enhanced training on issues taught during Phase 1;&#13;
responsive to current labor-management relation setting.&#13;
Task 8: Actual drafting of collective bargaining agreement at mine-level where possible;&#13;
management, union representatives and labor lawyer input will be crucial.&#13;
Task 9: Intensive focus on "Social Partnership' office in Ministry of Labor as it responds to&#13;
labor-management conflict and issues of mediation. Development of informational materials&#13;
for mine workers and management as to how to access Ministry of Labor and other mediation&#13;
services.&#13;
c. Paltic4pation in International Trnining&#13;
Task 10: Where possible, experience in Russian coal has demonstrated that exposure to the&#13;
international coal experience, notably tools for labor-management-government relations, has&#13;
been of tremendous use in opening avenues for new approaches to sector relations.&#13;
Participation in international seminars on labor mediation, labor-management relations and&#13;
mine visits where first-hand observation of working processes are all important.&#13;
d. Erpansion of Education Centers&#13;
Task 11: Where requested, it is possible to expand the Education Center network to other&#13;
mine locations in coordination with PIU activities.&#13;
Major Milestones&#13;
18.   Phase 1 will comprise:&#13;
a)    Ten Education Coordination Centers at ten mines in the above-referenced regions.&#13;
These models may be applicable to other coal regions.&#13;
b)    Production of Training Materials on topics listed above which will be suitable for&#13;
further distribution.&#13;
c)    Data base of selected collective bargaining agreements in ten selected coal regions&#13;
suitable for further training activities.&#13;

for further training activities.&#13;
f)    A minimum of ten trained Education Coordinators capable of conducting training in&#13;
other regions.&#13;
g)    Ten trained Information Coordinators capable of conducting training in other regions.&#13;
h)    Data base of actual experiences related to dispute resolution, conflict management,&#13;
labor-management relations, collective bargaining which may be used as both a&#13;
monitor of industrial relation practices and a method by which to identify problem&#13;
areas in the current industrial relations' atmosphere.&#13;
19.   Major Milestones for Phase 2 will be identified prior to implementation of Phase 2, taking&#13;
into account progress made during Phase 1.&#13;
Schedule&#13;
20.   The Industrial Relations Program will be administered over a twelve-month period. Staffing&#13;
will be carried out as follows:&#13;
X     Essential personnel (Umbrella Contractor staff) should be hired within one month;&#13;
*     Education and Information Coordinators in ten coal regions should be hired within&#13;
two months;&#13;
-     Training seminars underway in two months, and Training Centers in full operation&#13;
in four months.&#13;
Repoting Requirements&#13;
21.   Reporting requirements will comprise:&#13;
a)    The Umbrella Contractor will provide an inception report pertaining to Phase 1 of&#13;
TOR within five weeks of initiation of activities. This report will define areas in&#13;
which the TOR needs revision, as well as progress in meeting TOR goals. A similar&#13;
process will be followed in preparing to implement Phase 2 of the TOR.&#13;
b)    The Umbrella Contractor will develop reporting mechanisms and requirements with&#13;
the Education Coordinators, PIU and relevant local staff.&#13;
c)    The Umbrella Contractor will submit two periodic reports (one after four months and&#13;
another after eight months) on progress in complying with TOR requirements.&#13;
d)    The Umbrella Contractor will submit a final report which assesses whether the TA&#13;
objectives have been met, using the TOR as a measure of performance.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
SOCIAL ASSESSMENT: DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
1.    Objectives. The objectives of social assessment (SA) are to:&#13;
(a)   broaden the regional coverage of the systematic social assessment activities undrtaken&#13;
until March 1996;&#13;
(b)   deepen understanding of several key issues, including:&#13;
*     information/communication patterns of miners and communities&#13;
*     access/utilization of social assets/services&#13;
*     interactions with local and federal institutions&#13;
*     household assets (acquisition and los of changes in composition)&#13;
*     coping strategies&#13;
*     changes in levels and sources of income&#13;
-     attitudes on reform.&#13;
(c)   define the role of coal sector activities in a broader socio-economic context at the&#13;
household, communities/settlement, and regional levels;&#13;
(d)   develop a better understanding of the dynamics of change and patterns of adaptation&#13;
to transition.&#13;
2.    Approach. There are several SA activities already initiated by the Project Preparation Unit&#13;
(PPU). Several others are added to this list for financing under the Japan Grant Facility (JGF). The&#13;
focus of the proposed SA activities will be in the main coal regions which account for the majority&#13;
of employment and production in the coal sector.&#13;
3.    Specific Activities to be Accomplished. Specific SA activities proposed consist of the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)   expanding existing systematic SA database to Rostov and Tula through 800 additional&#13;
household surveys undertaken in four settlements. It is proposed that two of these&#13;
settlements will be associated with mines announced for closure starting in 1996 and&#13;
the other two will be near mines which will experience significant labor force&#13;
downsizing over the next few years, starting in 1996.&#13;
(b)   understanding the regional context within which coal reform takes place through focus&#13;
on two micro regions in Kuzbass and Rostov; defining the role of coal sector&#13;
operations (including the management of social assets) in the lives of the people in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44                                                                            Annex 3&#13;
dynamic context through the use of secondary data (for the past 5-10 years) and&#13;
through focus group discussions in the regions.&#13;
(c)   analyzing patterns of adjustment to reform through longitudinal studies, comparing&#13;
coal and non-coal employees who have left their jobs voluntarily with those who have&#13;
been laid off and focusing on institutional constraints to their adjustment.&#13;
(d)   analyzing changes in family budget, comparing coal communities with others by using&#13;
existing Goskomstat family budget studies and by adding a special target sample to&#13;
the existing sample base.&#13;
(e)   thematic studies on:&#13;
*     patterns of geographical mobility&#13;
*     impacts of restructuring on the disabled&#13;
*     impacts of lump sum payments on redundant work families.&#13;
4.    Instu&amp;onal Anangements. Each of the studies proposed will be undertaken by a separate&#13;
Russian institution. Findings and implications will be discussed by an Advisory Panel of Experts to&#13;
be established with representatives from the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Sociology,&#13;
Russian Center for Public Opinion and Market Research and Center of Opinion Polls. There will&#13;
also be an Executive Board, responsible from the coordination of assessment and impact monitoring&#13;
activities and servicing as the Secretariat for the Advisory Panel. This Board would consist of&#13;
members of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), including a participation specialist,&#13;
representatives from the Russian Center for Public Opinion and Market Research and Institute for&#13;
Comparative Labor Research Relations, and a social scientist from the World Bank. Other&#13;
collaborating academic and research institutions include the Coal Research Institute, Moscow Institute&#13;
for Economic Analysis, School of Economy, Institute of Labor, and the Institute for Comparative&#13;
Politics and Problems of Workers' Movement, Russian Academy of Sciences. Research units of labor&#13;
unions will also be among the collaborating institutions.&#13;

Expert Group Meeting is proposed to be held under the leadership of the Advisory Panel to:&#13;
(a)    evaluate implications of SA results completed;&#13;
(b)    further define monitoring indicators&#13;
(c)    develop detailed monitoring methods&#13;
(d)    review and finalize institutional arrangements.&#13;
8.     The Senior Advisor of Social Policy and Sociology of the World Bank, an international social&#13;
scientist experienced in social impacts of coal sector restructuring in other countries, the group of&#13;
Russian institutions collaborating on different aspects of SA, and representatives of the trade unions,&#13;
could be among the key participants.&#13;

COAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IMPLEMENTATION ASISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
SOCIAL IMACT MONITORING: DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Objecives&#13;
The objectives of social impact monitoring (SIM) consist of:&#13;
a)    ensuring that the individual benefits intended for mine workers made redundant by the&#13;
coal industry actually reach them; that entitlements of coal sector employees specified&#13;
by various legal instruments, including the tariff agreements reached by the trade&#13;
unions, are fully respected; that workers are fully informed of their entitlements and&#13;
are given notice as per existing laws and regulations; that there are mechanisms and&#13;
opportunities for recourse; and that the local, regional and Federal institutions&#13;
mandated to assist the workers actually provide such services. If intended benefits and&#13;
services do not reach the miners, an examination of the constraints and identification&#13;
of mechanisms to remove these will be necessary. Basically, this first objective of the&#13;
social impact monitoring will focus on the delivery of severance packages and can be&#13;
fiurther specified once the content of this package is defined.&#13;
b)    making sure that "voluntary departures" are based on adequate information and on&#13;
workers' free decisions. Should evidence suggest otherwise, SIM will focus on factors&#13;
which distort workers' ability to make free decisions. SIM will also propose&#13;
corrective measures.&#13;
c)    ensuring that geographical, job and housing mobility is not hindered and that the&#13;
measures envisioned under the reform program and the capacity building activities of&#13;
the World Bank loan are in place. Should this not be the case, SIM will propose&#13;
specific measures to enhance such mobility.&#13;
d)    ensuring that special groups such as migrant workers, the disabled, and women, do&#13;
not shoulder a disproportionate burden of restructuring. Should discriminatory&#13;
practices occur, SIM will identify contributing factors and propose mitigation&#13;
measures.&#13;
e)    ensuring that household and community access to and quality of social services are&#13;
not adversely affected in the process of restructuring. Should such adverse impacts&#13;
are observed, SIM will attempt to identify contributing factors, including coal sector&#13;
reform, and propose mitigation measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48                                                                            Annex 4&#13;
f)    creating an appreciation of the overall hardships of a transitional environment and&#13;
evaluating the relative social impacts of coal sector reform, in addition to the&#13;
absolute impacts listed above.&#13;
g)    ensuring that trust in institutions instrumental in reform implementation is not&#13;
weakened and that public perception of reform is not negatively influenced.&#13;
Speciflc Aims in Social Impact Monitoring&#13;
2.    SIM aims to demonstrate that:&#13;
a)    as compared to baseline, miners, their families and communities are better&#13;
cushioned with the Government's short and medium-term restructuring program;&#13;
b)    social safety measures put in place by the Program are implemented and reach the&#13;
intended beneficiaries to minimize, cushion or mitigate adverse impacts;&#13;
c)    the restructuring program takes place in a dynamic and complex transitional&#13;
environment in which adverse impacts of coal sector restructuring weigh less&#13;
heavily in the lives of the people than planned and/or spontaneous restructuring&#13;
in other sector activities;&#13;
d)    no region, settlement or social group (women, elderly, disabled, migrants) is&#13;
systematically disadvantaged;&#13;
e)    at the level of communities and individual enterprises/mines, restructuring takes&#13;
place when social safety measures are fully in place in a planned, open and&#13;
transparent fashion;&#13;
f)    institutions mandated with reform implementation, severance payments, training&#13;
and job placement, social assets management, etc., have the capacity and&#13;
commitment to perform their roles;&#13;
g)    decisions at all levels are taken with the participation of relevant stakeholders and&#13;
the mechanisms put in place to ensure such participation function; and&#13;
h)    public at large, especially in the coal regions, are informed of developments and&#13;
the trust in the reform agenda is not weakened.&#13;
Preliminary Indicators&#13;
3.    Monitoring indicators are listed below. More special indicators will be defined subsequent&#13;
to specification of program and project components. The indices of measurement will have to&#13;
be defined as appropriate at the level of individual workers, households, communities, and&#13;
micro-regions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4                                                                               49&#13;
-     access to full severance compensation as per existing laws;&#13;
-     accessibility of support for legal recourse;&#13;
-     ability to restore level of income prior to sector restructuring, including effective&#13;
utilization of severance compensation;&#13;
-     ability to identify alternative sources of income;&#13;
-     flexibility in changing household patterns of labor force participation;&#13;
-     job mobility, accessibility of alternative employment opportunities;&#13;
-     availability and accessibility of training, re-training and job placement services;&#13;
-     access to adequate level of social services in the course of sector restructuring (in&#13;
particular health and education);&#13;
ability to maintain standard of living prior to restructuring, including access to&#13;
heating/cooking energy, housing maintenance, utilities;&#13;
-     access to and availability of information on social safety measures prior to&#13;
departures from the sector (whether voluntary or not);&#13;
-     adequacy of support from local, regional and Federal agencies; and&#13;
-     adequacy of participation/representation in relevant decisions.&#13;
Selectivity&#13;
4.    The SIM will have to be selective in its emphasis in order to produce timely results in&#13;
a cost effective manner. This selectivity will be manifested in several ways:&#13;
a)    Regional focus: Surveys, case studies and a major portion of the field work will&#13;
focus primarily on five main coal basins: Kuzbass, Eastern Donbass, Pechora,&#13;
Moscow and Kisel coal basins.&#13;
b)    Focus on closures and substantial reductions: Since the major emphasis of the&#13;
SIM is minimization of the adverse impacts of restructuring, monitoring will&#13;
focus on mines scheduled for closure and large scale down sizing.&#13;
c)    Reliance on coal: SA has already established that some coal communities have&#13;
higher levels of exclusive reliance on the coal sector for employment than others.&#13;
SIM will focus more heavily on cases of exclusive reliance. However, SA studies&#13;
will attempt to put overall impacts in a more representative perspective by&#13;
showing the relationship between patterns of community reliance on the coal&#13;
sector and the patterns of adjustment to post-reform conditions.&#13;
5.    SIM  cannot seek "representiveness" in its results; rather, it will have to focus on&#13;
effectiveness of implementation arrangements for coal sector restructuring. First, many regions&#13;
have a handful of mines (e.g., Vorkuta has 15) and a search of a "representative mine&#13;
settlement" is not statistically fruitful. Secondly, SIM will monitor a process established on the&#13;
basis of a criteria of non-viability of mines-'; as mines are announced for closure and down&#13;
I'    It is expected that communities that will be facing mine closures have for some time been facing some of&#13;
the social consequences of these inefficiencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50                                                                            Annex 4&#13;
sizing, a major part of the SIM will focus on the communities, whether they are "typical" of the&#13;
coal regions or not.&#13;
Duration&#13;
6.    SIM will be initiated round September 1996 and will last for about 3 years.&#13;
Sources of Information and Methodology&#13;
7.    SIM will utilize several sources of primary and secondary data. It will also involve&#13;
longitudinal, cross-sectional and thematic studies, complementing one another in their regional&#13;
and issues coverage. The following provides a general description of the proposed effort; the&#13;
Expert Group Meeting mentioned under SA activities proposed for the period May - September&#13;
1996 will facilitate detailed description of the monitoring indicators and methodologies.&#13;
a)    Monitoring through secondary data with a focus on the analysis of total&#13;
redundancies, unemployment registration, training provided, and placement.&#13;
These data will be collected in all regions and sources of discrepancy for&#13;
redundancies, unemployment registration and placement.&#13;
b)    Cross section surveys of mine closures and large scale down sizing: Relatively&#13;
short surveys will be undertaken in a selected number of mines in the four&#13;
regions identified. Committees will be selected on the basis of closures lists&#13;
obtained from coal associations. About 1,000 interviews will be conducted with&#13;
employees who are made redundant (with a control group of those who have left&#13;
voluntarily) to ensure that the severance packages are received; social assets are&#13;
transferred and maintenance arrangements are made; unemployment registration&#13;
is made without delay and unemployment payments are received; adequate notice&#13;
was given prior to closures; information is available to make the necessary&#13;
adjustments; and institutions mandated with support to different categories of&#13;
workers (including the vulnerable groups such as the disabled) do actually provide&#13;
the required services.&#13;
c)    Longitudinal monitoring: This effort will focus on a small group of miners who&#13;
have left the industry voluntarily and those who were made redundant. It will&#13;
compare and contrast patterns of adjustment, job search, mobility, etc. A control&#13;
group of employees made redundant from non-mining sectors will also be traced&#13;
over the same period of time (of about 18 months) in order to identify relative&#13;
impacts of coal sector restructuring. This group of workers will be selected from&#13;
the communities included in the first round of cross section studies and will&#13;
consist of about 400 miners and 200 non-miners.&#13;
d)    Regional comparisons: A modest effort is proposed for SIM  purposes. This&#13;
effort, as described under the SA baseline studies, will compare two micro-&#13;
regions: one with heavy reliance on coal and the other with a more diverse&#13;
economic base (e.g., Prokopyevsk in Kuzbass and Borodinskaya in Tula) to assess&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4                                                                            51&#13;
differences in coping strategies and their implications for restructuring program&#13;
implementation beyond the period of SIM.&#13;
e)    Vulnerable groups: Small scale studies are proposed to monitor responses of&#13;
vulnerable groups (particularly the disabled and migrants) to sector restructuring.&#13;
f)    Thematic studies may be required as new issues emerge during the SIM period.&#13;
Thus, contingency funds are set aside to provide flexibility to SIM.&#13;
g)    At least one Expert Group Meeting will be required at the end of the SIM period&#13;
to take stock and to provide input to relevant stakeholders, including the Bank,&#13;
on coal sector reform.&#13;
h)    Given the critical importance of SIM, the publication of its in-term and final&#13;
results is important. These will have to be primarily Russian, with key findings&#13;
and publications summarized into English.&#13;
Instiutional Arrangements&#13;
8.    The proposed institutional arrangements for the conduct of SIM are as follows:&#13;
a)    All SIM will be undertaken by scientific institutions not affiliated formally with&#13;
any of the major stakeholders.&#13;
b)    However, as indicated under the Participation Arrangements (Annex 1), it is&#13;
recommended that trade union's SIM monitoring efforts are supported. These&#13;
focus primarily on employees within the sector and thus could provide useful&#13;
information on the success of the restructuring effort over time, while, at the&#13;
same time, helping unions build capacity for SIM.&#13;
c)    All SIM efforts will be guided by an Advisory Panel as described in the section&#13;
on SA (see institutional arrangements specified in the Social Assessment-program&#13;
proposed to be financed by the Japan Grant Facility - Annex 2 ).&#13;
d)    Institutions proposed for the implementation of the individual elements of SIM&#13;
include: Russian Center for Public Opinion and Market Research (7-b, above),&#13;
Institute of Comparative Labor Relations Research (7-a and c, above), Moscow&#13;
Institute for Economic Analysis (7-d, above) and the Russian Academy of&#13;
Sciences, Institute of Sociology (7-e, above). The Advisory Panel and the&#13;
Executive Board will be managed by PIU.&#13;

Genend Backgmund&#13;
1.    This component will provide technical assistance to assist in the design and implementation&#13;
of measures of social protection in 5 regions of the Russian Federation where mines will close.&#13;
Initially, the delivery of pre-redundancy counselling and mass layoff services in mines will be&#13;
undertaken by the Federal Employment Services (FES) through its network of regional and local&#13;
offices. The FES has already developed a range of programs and materials which would be of use&#13;
in these activities. Two other major programs are included as actions to be undertaken within the&#13;
World Bank Loan for Coal Restructuring (SECAL): (i) Support for the Social Assets Operation and&#13;
Maintenance Program to provide municipal management and capacity building to municipal and&#13;
regional government in the coal regions; and (ii) the Community Support and Employment Program&#13;
to operate in 5 specific towns in the coal basins where mines are scheduled to close. This Terms of&#13;
Reference describes the requirements needed to implement these programs.&#13;
PART 1. MUNICIPAL MANAGEMENT AND CAPACrry BUILDING IN SOCIAL SERVICES&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    In 1995 a large number of social assets have been transferred to the municipalities; however&#13;
the reallocation of federal funds which should accompany such a transfer has not yet occurred.&#13;
3.    The assets transferred include over 72%  of the mining association's housing, 66%  of&#13;
kindergartens and 22% of other social assets. Additional asset transfers are planned to take place later&#13;
in 1996. When the transfers are complete, some of the cities will face an increase of their housing&#13;
stock of up to 3800%, as well as a municipal expenditure increase of 150%. Even under a normal&#13;
fiscal environment such massive transfers will put the municipalities under great financial and&#13;
managerial strain to meet the incremental recurring cost. The task will be even more difficult in an&#13;
environment where the municipal tax-base is decreasing due to the coal sector difficulties. Currently,&#13;
an adequate response by municipalities in the coal regions is limited by lack of access to professional&#13;
legal, financial, and managerial services, which additionally hampers their adjustment.&#13;
4.    Therefore, a key aspect of sustainability of social development in coal settlements will be the&#13;
establishment and fulfillment of the financial and institutional conditions for both completing&#13;
divestiture and post-divestiture operations of transferred assets. Subsequent to resolving adequately&#13;
this budgetary impasse, and social assets are finally accepted and paid for by the local governments,&#13;
these local governments will need to implement a series of necessary measures and make substantial&#13;
adjustments to reduce operating costs and to close excessive facilities. The municipalities will have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54                                                                                   Annex 5&#13;
to improve fiscal management in the public sector, including rationalization of budget process,&#13;
increase cost recovery from the users fees, introduction of targeted subsidies to poor families, etc.&#13;
5.     Past experiences shows that, in general, social assets divestiture has taken place without prior&#13;
rationalization. As a result, in many cases the quality of services has decreased and cutting off&#13;
essential services has happened in an unplanned and disruptive manner.&#13;
6.    To mitigate this situation international donors have started to provide technical assistance to&#13;
municipalities. For instance, they have been disseminating on a pilot basis information on effective&#13;
technical approaches to housing reforms and privatization of housing stock and utilities, rationalization&#13;
of kindergartens, and the improvements in the local tax base. These existing programs offer good&#13;
examples of efforts to respond to particular needs of coal regions. Moreover, availability of already&#13;
developed programs provide examples of how technical assistance is being applied.&#13;
7.    As the restructuring of the coal industry takes place, the local authorities will need, in addition&#13;
to financial and management assistance, legal assistance as well. There will be also be the need of&#13;
timely dissemination of changes in the legislative and fiscal framework and the provision of better&#13;
information to the stakeholders affected by the restructuring process.&#13;
Objective&#13;
8.    The objective of part one is to assist the municipal and regional governments in the coal&#13;
regions during the coal industry restructuring period with advisory and training services to improve&#13;
the delivery of core social services and increase the overall local managerial capacity, to provide&#13;
training to core administrative personnel, and to build stakeholder consensus to change.&#13;
Spe4fic Activities to be Accomplished&#13;
9.     Attachment A to this Terms of Reference provides the specific requirements to be met by the&#13;
consultants being sought to assist in the execution of this part of the program.&#13;
10.   The concept of is a fundamental approach to institution building. Institutional support would&#13;
be focused on upgrading the analytical capacity of local governments and the training of local trainers&#13;
will be based on municipal needs to reflect an "action-training" approach: participative, practical,&#13;
hands-on experience.&#13;
11.   The training to be accomplished would cover but not be limited to:&#13;
Planning: City level strategic planning (finance operating and planning). Development of&#13;
strategic planning for creation of cost-effective integrated social service delivery system,&#13;
programs for cooperative and community based services, privatization of social infrastructure&#13;
and real estate, data collection system that facilitates accurate forecast and budgeting,&#13;
development of indicators to measure cost effectiveness of services provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5                                                                           55&#13;
Management: Improving existing institutional arrangements. Competitive contracting&#13;
procedures. Rationalization of municipal sector operations for housing, education and health.&#13;
Organization of condominium associations. Utility management and regulation.&#13;
Finance: Resources mobilization options. Municipal finance and management principles.&#13;
Pricing and cost recovery. Improvement of tax collection. Clarification of intra-region (i.e.&#13;
between regional and municipal administrations) responsibilities and fiscal relations in the coal&#13;
regions. Standardizing Accounting and Financial Reporting Systems. Cash flow models.&#13;
Legal: Information dissemination on new regulations&#13;
Management Information Systems: Support should be given to develop computerized&#13;
systems covering budget, management, financial management, controls, etc.&#13;
PART 2. COMMUNTY SUPPORT AND EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS&#13;
Backgmund&#13;
12.   The difficult national economic and employment situation within which the coal restructuring&#13;
program is unfolding requires special approaches to respond specifically to local coal community&#13;
needs. In some coal communities, unemployment and social problems are at least as severe for&#13;
families in the non-coal sector as for families in the coal sector itself. The economic and employment&#13;
structure and prospects of the coal regions vary greatly with some coal basins having relative&#13;
opportunities for economic diversification and adjustment whereas others, being remote single&#13;
industry coal towns, will have few alternative employment opportunities. Therefore, approaches in&#13;
dealing with coal redundancies will need to vary and be tailored to local community needs. In&#13;
particular, it is desirable to design programs that will promote diversification by enhancing employee&#13;
mobility between sectors and between regions, as well as programs that increase employment outside&#13;
the coal sector in the coal communities themselves&#13;
13.  In addition, because of the absence of developed delivery agents (either Govemmental or Non&#13;
Govemmental) there are limited resources in place which would be capable of dealing quickly with&#13;
the anticipated social problems in areas where mines will close. For this reason it will be necessary&#13;
to put in place exceptional measures to support these communities. Under the World Bank Coal&#13;
SECAL Loan, some subsidies paid by Rosugol under the heading of Mine Closures should now be&#13;
allocated for the creation of demonstration Community Support and Employment Programs in 5 coal&#13;
towns (in the Pechora, Kuzbass, Eastern Donbass, Moscow and Kisel Basins. An amount still to be&#13;
determined should be allocated to each basin for a series of programs to be operated at local level&#13;
with in kind contributions by local authorities (e.g., buildings; materials; equipment). These initiatives&#13;
will build on and further develop the work begun by the Inter Agency Coal Commission in its&#13;
Regional Coal Restructuring Programs.&#13;
14.   The overall objective of these Community programs will be to integrate present and possible&#13;
new resources not only to meet immediate needs but also to plan and undertake longer term strategies&#13;
and efforts in creating employment opportunities. Specifically these programs will:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                                                                            Annex 5&#13;
(a)   Put in place an agency or trust to manage the funds and guarantee that the funds are&#13;
received by those for whom they are intended. In each town it is possible that a&#13;
different local development agency will be set up. Some could be incorporated as&#13;
local enterprises; some could be agents or funds.&#13;
(b)   Establish a local committee to act as a local development agency; this would comprise&#13;
representatives of local administration; business people, trade unions; NGOs; and&#13;
employment services.&#13;
(c)   Develop a local focus in each community to encourage self dependence and foster&#13;
leadership skills. The center will provide information services and promote conflict&#13;
resolution.&#13;
(d)   Develop emergency social programs; canteens for the poor and disadvantaged;&#13;
creation of day care centers; special programs for the unemployed to get credit and&#13;
SME training; job clubs; counselling for disabled and young people leaving school&#13;
early.&#13;
15.   In addition two specialized actions should be developed: (i) a local economic development&#13;
progrun which would undertake the planning of longer term economic diversification measures; and,&#13;
(ii) a transitional employment program. Within these two broad programs there will be a menu of&#13;
appropriate service packages for each community which will be determined by the beneficiaries.&#13;
(i)    The Local Economic Development Program (LEDP) would carry out an economic&#13;
diversification effort aimed at creating sustainable new jobs through the development&#13;
of new enterprises and expanding existing ones. A local economic development&#13;
strategy based on an analysis of the area's development and growth potential would&#13;
be developed which would include marketing and enterprise promotion elements.&#13;
Identification of unused facilities which could house new enterprises would be made.&#13;
The LEDP's activities could include technical assistance to small and medium&#13;
businesses; setting up business incubators; establishing revolving loan funds; and in&#13;
certain situations, grants might be appropriate for needed infrastructure such as&#13;
rehabilitating public facilities to be leased to enterprises and investing funds in&#13;
environmental maintenance. Assistance in processing licenses and other government&#13;
approvals for enterprises as well as customized worker training would be provided.&#13;
This will include also restructuring of vocational schools to provide new training&#13;
opportunities being in agreement with long term prospects of regional development.&#13;
The LEDP could be based on the pilot economic development efforts being developed&#13;
by the Federal Employment Services for economically devastated areas.&#13;
(ii)   The Transitional Employment Program (TEP) would provide interim employment&#13;
for workers for whom alternative employment cannot be found and whose&#13;
unemployment and other benefits have been exhausted. Employment would be&#13;
provided in community projects such as rehabilitating housing, cleaning up the&#13;
environment, repairing public facilities, etc. The projects would be labor intensive&#13;
requiring only modest outlays for equipment and materials. The projects would have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5                                                                          57&#13;
a fixed length and the project plan would set out the work to be accomplished,&#13;
employment to be generated, supervision, wages, cost breakdowns, etc. The specific&#13;
TEP projects would be approved and monitored by the IAC Commission. A portion&#13;
of the jobs for TEP will derive from social asset rehabilitation described above.&#13;
Objective&#13;
16.   The goal of this component of the TA is to establish the institutional capacity at the regional&#13;
and local level to provide the needed reemployment and related assistance to the unemployed in the&#13;
coal areas. The building of institutional capacity includes assistance in designing the programs to be&#13;
provided, helping to organize the administrative and operational systems, and providing support in&#13;
program implementation.&#13;
Approach&#13;
17.   CSEP programs will be developed in towns in 5 coal regions which are experiencing the&#13;
greatest unemployment difficulties (Pechora, Moscow, Kuzbass, Eastem Donbass and Kisel). The&#13;
first phase would be the design and development of the overall CSEP program. It is envisaged that&#13;
this approach will be a demonstration project which will be replicable in other crisis areas. Within&#13;
the broad programs there will be a menu of appropriate service packages for each community which&#13;
will be determined by the beneficiaries.&#13;
Specific Activities to be Accomplshed&#13;
18.   The consultant shall be required to:&#13;
(a)   prepare a preliminary design of the CSEP program and its component parts, as well&#13;
as a detailed implementation plan and schedule.&#13;
(b)   The proposed CSEP and component program framework, would be submitted by the&#13;
PIU to the IACC for approval.&#13;
(c)   A pilot CSEP would be designed and implemented. The activity would include&#13;
assessing the specific needs, requirements and opportunities of the region and its local&#13;
areas; preparing the basic model prograam (noting that other regional and local&#13;
variations will need to be accommodated); developing action plans with supporting&#13;
organizational structure; fostering regional and local agreement and participation;&#13;
assisting the responsible organizations and authorities in developing detailed program&#13;
plans including management systems; supporting the implementation of specific&#13;
projects and activities; and providing other ad hoc assistance as needed. A key set of&#13;
TA activities would include briefing the involved regional and local authorities on the&#13;
proposed CSEP approach, its activities and requirements; enlisting non-governmental&#13;
participation in the CSEP effort, i.e., enterprises and entrepreneurs, NGOs, etc.; and&#13;
helping to sort the role and functions of the involved organizations, particularly in the&#13;
coordination of regional and local efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                                                                              Annex 5&#13;
Institutional Arirngements&#13;
19.   The Regional offices of the coal commission will coordinate and oversee the implementation&#13;
of these programs, through a consultative mechanism and with the involvement of concerned&#13;
governmental and private entities in order to utilize fully existing programs and resources as well as&#13;
to develop new activities as warranted. The Regional Commissions would involve concerned&#13;
stakeholders: i.e., governmental agencies especially the regional and local offices of the Employment&#13;
Services, enterprises, private entrepreneurs, unions, NGOs and other parties as appropriate. They&#13;
would work closely with the coal companies own labor reduction programs. They would be&#13;
responsible for ensuring that employment and related programs such as advance notice procedures,&#13;
pre-redundancy job search, transfer and counselling programs, administration of unemployment&#13;
benefits and related income support programs, job creation, including transitional employment&#13;
projects, and other employment assistance are available and functioning effectively at community&#13;
level. The regional commissions would establish a Supervisory Committee in the settlements near&#13;
mines to be closed which would provide the operational locus for carrying out the social safety net&#13;
activities as well as providing advice on legal entitlements and how to access assistance. The&#13;
Supervisory Committee would also monitor that funds were arriving from federal level and that&#13;
beneficiaries were in receipt of their proper entitlements.&#13;
20.   In the 5 pilot towns, local agents of the coal commission would be charged with overseeing&#13;
the programs of restructuring local social assets and reducing the fiscal burden of their maintenance&#13;
through appropriate privatization, increase in cost recovery, facilitating cost savings in the public&#13;
institutions, and closing excessive facilities. To stop further deterioration in quality of public services,&#13;
it is suggested that under proposed Community Support and Employment Programs, the 5 coal&#13;
municipalities will receive additional TA to support restructuring of their social asset stock in the&#13;
areas of the budget planning and management, utility regulations, competitive maintenance in&#13;
housing, etc. As a part of these efforts, division of responsibilities between regional and municipal&#13;
governments in the coal regions have to be clarified with corresponding redesign of intra-regional&#13;
fiscal relations.&#13;
21.   The adequacy of the delivery systems which provide the benefits and services available&#13;
through the legal social safety net should be addressed. Strengthening of the administrative capacity&#13;
of local offices of the Ministry of Social Protection and of the Employment Services in the coal areas&#13;
is needed as many local offices are not positioned to handle any sizable increase in workload. The&#13;
regional coal commissions would establish additional temporary or permanent social services as the&#13;
needs arise. The Implementation Assistance Project will provide technical assistance for the design&#13;
and start up of these programs.&#13;
Specific Activities to be Accomplished by the Consulting Firm&#13;
-define package of measures needed to create a Community Employment Program to&#13;
implement local development projects&#13;
-define a suitable instrument and to agree on operating arrangements for the Fund and criteria&#13;
of disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5                                                                           59&#13;
-develop transparent and equitable transparent operating guidelines to ensure community&#13;
support and diversification programs are funded during the second half of 1996 and&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
Level of Eifoit&#13;
22.   This work requires 8 person years of consultancy, including about 4 person years at the&#13;
federal level and 4 person years at the regional/local levels.&#13;
Benefiiares&#13;
23.   The assistance for the Social Assets Operation and Maintenance Program will benefit four&#13;
regional administrations located in the coal basins (Pechora, Moscow, Kuzbass, Eastern Donbass and&#13;
Kisel), where a social component is proposed under the same project.&#13;
24.   The Community Support and Employment Programs will benefit the ex employees of coal&#13;
companies; their families and communities directly.&#13;
-rpected Output&#13;
25.   Programs disbursing in 5 regions. The expected output will include but will not be limited&#13;
to: procedure manuals for competitive tenders, financial management handbooks, training programs&#13;
and seminars, technical advisory services, etc. manual for use in other regions. Guidelines and&#13;
criteria for fund disbursement.&#13;
26.   The project should be able to develop a institutional basis that can support subsequent phases&#13;
and initiatives in the area of management training. Once the fiscal situation is improved, the training&#13;
programs developed under this TA component may be delivered on the commercial basis by AMC&#13;
to its members.&#13;
Pnojed Implementation&#13;
27.   The proposed technical assistance component could be managed through the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit as a non-commercial foundation.&#13;
28.   Regional Coal Commissions (RCC), chaired by First Deputy of Regional Governors, have&#13;
been established in 5 participating regions and are to become the major implementation agency on&#13;
the ground. The Commissions will interact directly with the Federal coal commission and with&#13;
RosUgol. Regional Representatives of various federal agencies (e.g., Employment Service, Pension&#13;
Fund, Treasury, etc.) should be included in the composition of the RCC. The Commissions will be&#13;
given the control over various flows of the federal assistance, which in the coming years will be&#13;
gradually removed from RosUgol (funds for social assets maintenance, new housing construction,&#13;
new job creation and regional development, severance payments). RCC should be major recipients&#13;
of TA and they would provide an administrative support for delivery of the technical assistance to&#13;
the municipal level, providing relevant participation (representation and coverage) of all main coal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60                                                                            Annex 5&#13;
communities. RCC will be partly funded by regional budgets (existing regional development&#13;
programs).&#13;
29.   Association of Mining Cities (AMC) should also play an important role in TA&#13;
implementation. AMC will provide an important insight with respect to final design of the trining&#13;
and advisory services (priorities and consequence of proposed activities, main forms and channels&#13;
of service delivery). In addition, the association will provide an important feedback regarding actually&#13;
delivery of TA and its productivity. AMC, which is a new organization with a small constituent base,&#13;
will also need some institutional and organizational support to become self sufficient over two to three&#13;
years. This could be achieved through membership fees.&#13;
Source and Level of Resources Available&#13;
30.   The PIU will have resources for the 5 pilot regions. These will, of course, require review and&#13;
revision as the level of detail required in the becomes clearer and also in the light of the actual fee&#13;
rates negotiated.&#13;
Resources to be Supplied by the Consultant&#13;
31.   The consultant is expected to provide expertise, international transportation, international&#13;
communications, computer needs. local transportation and accommodations for staff not resident in&#13;
Moscow.&#13;
Resources to be Supplied by the PIU&#13;
32.   The PIU will provide office space, telephones and domestic phone costs, and a counterpart&#13;
staff of an appropriate number of individuals to work directly with the primary consultant in the&#13;
execution of the program.&#13;
Reports&#13;
33.   The primary consultant will be required to submit to the PIU:&#13;
(a)   an inception report (within 30 days of beginning services) outlining the work schedule&#13;
proposed and activities for the first 6 months of the program;&#13;
(b)   a quarterly report detailing activities undertaken and projections of work for the next&#13;
quarter, problems encountered, recommendations for future actions, and status of&#13;
overall program effectiveness.&#13;
(c)   a mid-term report establishing progress towards program objectives.&#13;
Quahfications Required&#13;
34.   The consultant will be expected to have demonstrated experience in the design and&#13;
implementation of a range of social programs and funds. and to have experience of working with&#13;
local authorities preferably in transition economies. The firm should have experience working in the&#13;
&#13;

IMLEMENTATION OF SOCIAL SAFETY NET GUIDELINES:&#13;
CONSULTANT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Backgrund&#13;
1.    A mechanism will be established whereby all subsidies formerly paid to Rosugol could&#13;
be channeled directly to appropriate regional and local government for the maintenance of the&#13;
social assets and the creation of programs which will be of direct benefit to miners, their&#13;
families and communities. The Government has indicated to the Bank that an agreement has been&#13;
reached on a new, more effective approach to allocate both the social sphere and diversification&#13;
subsidies starting in January 1997. Arrangements for the second half of 1996 are not yet in&#13;
place.&#13;
2.    In order to divert the subsidies, it is necessary to define suitable channels and instruments&#13;
at Federal, Regional and Local level and to agree on operating arrangements and criteria of&#13;
disbursement with the GOR.&#13;
3.    The Implementation Assistance Project will put in place assistance both for the Social&#13;
Assets Operation and Maintenance and for the design of appropriate mechanisms for the&#13;
Community Support and Employment Programs in 5 towns in the coal basins where mines are&#13;
scheduled to close.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
4.    The Technical Assistance for the Conmmunity Support and Employment will be to assist&#13;
efforts under the program to:&#13;
(a)   put in place an agency or trust to manage the funds and guarantee that the funds&#13;
are received by those for whom they are intended. In each town it is possible that&#13;
a different local development agency will be set up . . . some could be&#13;
incorporated as local enterprises; some could be agents or funds.&#13;
(b)   establish a local Supervisor committee; this would comprise representatives of&#13;
local administration; business people, trade unions; NGOs; employment services;&#13;
(c)   develop a local focus in each community to encourage self dependence; foster&#13;
leadership skills; the center will provide information and counselling services and&#13;
promote conflict resolution&#13;
(d)   develop mechanism for sustainable development (include business incubators;&#13;
local credit guarantee schemes); invest funds in environmental maintenance;&#13;
utilities improvement schemes including water supply facilities and sewage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5                                                                            63&#13;
(f)   develop emergency social programs; canteens for the poor and disadvantaged;&#13;
creation of day care centers; special programs for the unemployed to get credit and&#13;
SME taining; job clubs; counselling for disabled and young people leaving school&#13;
early.&#13;
5.    Environmental concerns will be addressed directly through microprojects which will have a&#13;
positive effect on the physical environment.&#13;
6.    It is envisaged that this approach will be a demonstration project which will be replicable in&#13;
other crisis areas.&#13;
Tasks:&#13;
(i)   preparation of a package of measures and linkages needed to create a Community&#13;
Employment Program to implement local development projects under transparent and&#13;
equitable operating guidelines to ensure community support and diversification&#13;
programs are funded during the second half of 1996 and thereafter.&#13;
(ii)   preparation of a Project Operation Manual which will include (as well as the&#13;
regulations and description of the overall scheme) a number of sections which will&#13;
address the specific operations of each window or program (e.g., community&#13;
programs; business support programs; micro-enterprise credit; training for specific&#13;
labor needs; environmental cleanup; housing rehabilitation; kindergarten operations;&#13;
community infrastructure; children's playgrounds - all to be determined by the&#13;
beneficiaries and by community needs&#13;
(iii)  coordination, design, and implement training programs for 5 coal towns.&#13;
7.    This would eventually address also the issue of sustainability as such an approach would&#13;
ensure that know how would be transferred to the grass root level of local communities who have&#13;
no experience of acting on their own initiative.&#13;

MANAGEMENT OF STATE FINANCING FOR THE COAL INDUSTRY:&#13;
DRAFr TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The coal industry restructuring program initiated by the Russian Federation Government&#13;
requires reform of the existing mechanism of state support for the industry.&#13;
2.    The restructuring of the coal industry requires a series of measures based on market economic&#13;
principles and focus on the transformation of production and organizational structures, and addressing&#13;
social and economic problems in the coal regions. A more detailed list of measures may be found&#13;
in "Basic Trends for Restructuring the Russian Coal Industry".&#13;
3.    The main economic objective behind restructuring is an accelerated formation of coal markets&#13;
for competitive coal companies which will not require federal budget allocations for effective&#13;
functioning, post-restructuring.&#13;
4.    Restructuring will be financed mainly from the federal budget.&#13;
5.    In compliance with Presidential Decree No. 168, February 9, 1996, "Measures for Improving&#13;
the Structure of the Russian Coal Industry", the Russian Government shall approve of the Regulatory&#13;
Document for the State financing of activities providing better understanding of the allocation system&#13;
and use of State support funds for Russian coal industry restructuring, as well as, authorizing the&#13;
Inter-Agency Coal Commission to approve the schedules for allocating funds and to oversee their&#13;
targeted use.&#13;
Goals and Objectives&#13;
6.    The main objective of the project to improve the management of State financing for Russian&#13;
coal industry restructuring (hereinafter referred to as the "Project") is to design a set of measures for&#13;
practical implementation of the regulations for the management of State support funds, as specified&#13;
by the Regulations "On State Financing for the Russian Coal Industry Restructuring". In order to&#13;
implement the above mentioned objective the following must be done:&#13;
(i)   identify the drawbacks of the existing system of State support of the Russian coal&#13;
industry and list its specific characteristics, to be considered designing a new&#13;
mechanism;&#13;
(ii)   design the most appropriate and detailed procedures for creating, allocating and&#13;
channeling subsidies to the beneficiaries and the procedure to control over their use;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66                                                                              Aanex 6&#13;
(iii)  based on specific research, identify criteria for tracking the results of State financial&#13;
support for Russian coal industry restructuring and the results of addressing related&#13;
social problems in coal mining regions;&#13;
(iv)   elaborate the economic patterns and organizational procedures for adjusting the level&#13;
of budget allocations in accordance with financial commitments; as well as the&#13;
patterns and procedures for adjusting beneficiaries' responsibilities in instance where&#13;
promised budget allocations are provided at a different level;&#13;
(v)   design a computer system to collect, maintain and process information on State&#13;
support funds allocated to each beneficiary, and charting beneficiaries'competence in&#13;
meeting obligations.&#13;
Specific Activities to be Accomplished&#13;
7.    In compliance with the above mentioned objectives the project implementation will include&#13;
the development of the following:&#13;
(i)    A Systematic Analysis of the Existing Mechanism for Government Support for the&#13;
Coal Industry&#13;
8.    The first set of measures shall include a general, systematic analysis of the existing&#13;
mechanism of financing the Russian coal sector, based on "State Support to Coal Enterprises"&#13;
Regulatory Document confirmed by the Council of Ministers and by the Russian Government&#13;
Regulatory Document No. 727 of July 27, 1993, "Measures to Support Coal Enterprises and&#13;
Taxes/Duties (Excise) for Coal". The first set of activities will result in a general systematic&#13;
description of the existing mechanism for the government support for the coal industry, which will&#13;
serve as a basis for detaining obstacles to be eliminated, as well as list of positive features to be&#13;
maintained while designing a new mechanism for State support for the coal industry.&#13;
(ii)   Design a Set of Measures to Implement a Mechanism of Managing the State Support&#13;
Funds&#13;
9.    The second set of measures set shall be a number of projecting and research activities which&#13;
will assist the implementation of state support management regulations set by the Decree "On State&#13;
Financing for the Coal Industry Restructuring". These measures shall result in drafting a system of&#13;
management for state support funds, to provide their efficient use, which system will include:&#13;
*     preparation of financial requests&#13;
*     preparation of financing schedules&#13;
*     signing agreements specifying beneficiaries' commitments to implement restructuring&#13;
*     disbursement of tranches and channeling funds to beneficiaries&#13;
*     control over meeting commitments imposed by agreements including control over&#13;
targeted use of State support funds&#13;
*     adjusting the volume of financing in accordance with achievements in restructuring&#13;
as a result of previously allocated State support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6                                                                             67&#13;
*     adjusting beneficiaries' responsibilities in accordance with actual budget allocations&#13;
(iii)   Draft Sample Agreements on Use of State Support&#13;
10.   The third set of measures will include studies of the experience of signing agreements&#13;
concerning State support funds use in Russian coal industry restructuring. Based on this research, to&#13;
identify the defects to be eliminated while drafting a sample agreement, and to identify positive&#13;
features to be preserved while drafting a new agreement. The third set will also specify the criteria&#13;
for adequate description of agreements terms, as well as criteria for fulfilling commitments by budget&#13;
funding beneficiaries. Two different situations will be considered: (a) when the existing State system&#13;
of accounting contains criteria giving an adequate idea of restructuring results; (b) when the existing&#13;
State system of accounting contains no such data. In the second case (b) it is necessary to work out&#13;
suggestions about the changes in the State system of accounting, for it to include the information&#13;
needed.&#13;
11.   The third set will result in draft sample agreements of using federal budget funds, between&#13;
state organs responsible for the allocation of the funds (or their authorized agents) and beneficiaries&#13;
of the budget funds. The drafts will comply with current legislation and be endorsed and tested in&#13;
practice.&#13;
(iv)   Patterns for Adjusting Agreements to Use State Support Funds&#13;
12.   The forth set of measures will be devoted to the research on modeling relations between the&#13;
restructuring and the volume of State financing. Research will result in (a) developing a procedure&#13;
for adjusting the level of budget allocations according to restructuring results achieved due to using&#13;
previously allocated funds; and (b), elaborating a procedure for adjusting beneficiaries' responsibilities&#13;
in accordance with actual budget allocations. The draft procedures will comply with current&#13;
legislation, will be endorsed and tested in practice.&#13;
(v)   Draft a Computer Program for State Support Management&#13;
13.   The fifth set of measures will result in drafting a computer program  for collecting,&#13;
maintaining and processing information concerning the distribution and use of State support funds,&#13;
and conceming the results of Russian coal industry restructuring achieved due to this funding. The&#13;
computer program will be based on procedures, economic pattems and methods specified in the&#13;
previously described four sets of measures. The computer program will contain blank forms for&#13;
in-coming information and the method of calculating the processing of information. The computer&#13;
system will consist of two modules, an informational and an analytical one.&#13;
14.   The informational module will provide the programs to register, store an and collect&#13;
information conceming the management of State support funds. This module will provide protection&#13;
of the data base against unauthorized access, the personal responsibility for the in-coming and&#13;
out-going information and also, the access to this information for the state management organs. The&#13;
informational module will consist of a number of sub-modules for implementing a set of related&#13;
functions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68                                                                            Annex 6&#13;
*     registering and storing information about the financing schedules for specific&#13;
beneficiaries and about the targeted use of budget funds;&#13;
*     registering and storing information about the responsibilities of beneficiaries of state&#13;
support and about the results of the funds use;&#13;
*     registering and storing information on actually disbursed tranches with breakdown by&#13;
beneficiaries and directions;&#13;
*     registering and storing the information about the actual fulfillment of their&#13;
commitments by budget fund beneficiaries.&#13;
15.   The analytical module will result in a computer format for decision making concerning the&#13;
efficient allocation of State support funds. The analytical module will consist of a number of&#13;
sub-modules to implement a set of related functions:&#13;
*     an analysis of finance schedules to confirm compliance with priorities set by&#13;
Government policy for the coal industry and to elaborate recommendations for the&#13;
schedules adjustment;&#13;
*     formation of a weekly schedule, based on a quarterly schedule, for uniform&#13;
implementation;&#13;
*     monitoring implementation of financing schedules;&#13;
3     calculating the next tranche with the aim to minimize the difference between the&#13;
volume of funds actually allocated and that specified in the financing schedule,&#13;
considering prior experience of using budget funds, priorities in State support&#13;
allocation and the force majeure situations;&#13;
*     adjustment of commitments specified in the agreement, regarding the level of budget&#13;
allocations in accordance with meeting obligations;&#13;
*     adjustment of responsibilities specified in the agreement, in accordance with actual&#13;
budget allocations.&#13;
16.   Each of the above-mentioned modules and sub-modules will be developed in two stages. The&#13;
first stage will result in development of various drafts, within a very short period of time and at low&#13;
cost and be tested to choose the best. The second stage will result in the selection of a draft to be&#13;
used.&#13;
Op&#13;
17.   The drafting team will include experts in designing the organizational systems, experts in the&#13;
coal industry economics, financing, accounting and statistics, economic legislation, computerization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

COAL SECTOR REsrRuCTURING IMLEMENTATION AsSIsTANCE PROJEcT&#13;
RuSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
SPECiAL PuRPosE AUDITS OF STATE FINANCING FOR THE COAL SECTOR:&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Backgmrund&#13;
1.    Restructuring the coal sector is part of the Government's program which is crucial for&#13;
sustaining stabilization of the Russian economy. In particular, the coal sector has been the second&#13;
largest recipient of budget subsidies in the country. Further, a large part of the subsidies have been&#13;
used to cover operational losses of regional coal companies and mine investments, thus hindering&#13;
competition and financial discipline in the coal sector. The problems inherent in this subsidy system&#13;
have been exacerbated by the lack of transparency and financial accountability in the subsidy&#13;
management system.&#13;
2.    The Government has placed high priority on restructuring the coal sector. In mid-1993, an&#13;
Inter-Agency Commission for Socio-Economic Problems of Coal-Producing Regions (Coal&#13;
Commission) was created for the purpose of advising the Government on coal industry restructuring.&#13;
Since then, the Government has prepared a large scale restructuring program aimed at transforming&#13;
the coal industry into a sustainable and competitive sector of the economy. The principal objectives&#13;
of the Program are to: (i) reduce the impact of the coal sector on the federal budget; (ii) promote the&#13;
long term sustainability of the coal sector through the establishment of a non-monopolistic,&#13;
commercial industry; (iii) increase efficiency through judicious reduction in the size of the industry;&#13;
and (iv) cushion the impact of the restructuring on coal miners, their families and affected&#13;
communities.&#13;
3.    Regulations. The Government Resolution No.598 (May 17, 1996) on "State Financing of the&#13;
Coal Industry Restructuring Measures" include, among others, the following provisions:&#13;
(a)   reclassification of the subsidy categories. For the first six months of 1996, the&#13;
aggregate level of approved budget support for the coal sector has been divided by&#13;
the primary recipient, RosUgol, into six main categories: (i) tariff agreement; (ii)&#13;
social sphere; (iii) operating losses; (iv) mine closing; (v) investment (including&#13;
leasing which was a separate category in 1995); and (vi) central reserve fund. These&#13;
categories have been, in turn, subdivided by into some twenty seven subcategories&#13;
(Attachment 1). The aforementioned Government Resolution revised the&#13;
classifications of subsidies into two broad categories: (i) restructuring; and (ii)&#13;
temporary support for production; these are, in turn, divided into twelve&#13;
subcategories;&#13;
(b)   the Ministry of Fuels and Energy would conclude contracts with the primary&#13;
recipients of budget funds, who in turn conclude contracts with the ultimate recipients&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72                                                                            Annex 7&#13;
of these funds (notably regional coal companies). The number of primary recipients&#13;
would increase from essentially only one (RosUgol) to include, among others,&#13;
regional administrations. The agreements on targeted utilization of the budget would&#13;
include, among others, the amounts of state support fund allocation and commitments&#13;
of the recipients of these funds;&#13;
(c)   the Coal Commission will allocate quarterly subsidies (broken down on a monthly&#13;
basis) to the primary and ultimate recipients on the basis of fulfilling their&#13;
commitments, according to the above mentioned agreements, for each preceding&#13;
quarter;&#13;
(d)   state reporting of actual allocated amounts and results of their utilization, regular&#13;
audit, and publication of financial reports are introduced for all levels (stages) of&#13;
allocation and utilization of the state support funds; and&#13;
(e)   State Committee on Statistics provides to the federal executive bodies quarterly and&#13;
annual reports on socio-economic development of the coal mining regions and actual&#13;
utilization of the state support funds for the coal industry.&#13;
4.    Subsidy Distiibution Mechanisns. Since 1995, the Treasury Department of Ministry of&#13;
Finance started to channel subsidy (at least once a week) through an increasing number of regional&#13;
Treasury Departments which, in turn, distributed the subsidy through commercial banks to recipients.&#13;
By now, about 90% of the subsidies are channelled by these mechanisms. Only 2 regions do not have&#13;
Treasury Department; the subsidies for these two regions (0.5% of 1996 subsidy) and those for&#13;
central reserve fund continue to be distributed by Rosugol (about 10% of 1996 subsidy).&#13;
5.    Proposed Coal Sector Restructuring Implementation Assistance Project. The Government&#13;
of Russian Federation has sought World Bank financing for the proposed Project. The ultimate&#13;
objective of this Project is to enhance the effectiveness in implementation of the coal sector&#13;
restructuring program through assistance to the Government, affected people and organizations.&#13;
Specifically, the Project has the following objectives: (a) improvements in management of the&#13;
restructuring process through increased participation of stakeholders as well as enhancement in&#13;
transparency and openness; (b) in the short run, filling critical skill gaps in a number of key areas,&#13;
including subsidy management, which are essential to design the details and implement the&#13;
restructuring program effectively; and (c) in the long run, strengthen the country's institutional&#13;
capacity to sustain reform.&#13;
6.    Project Implementation Arrangements. A Project Preparation Unit (PPU), established in&#13;
the Ministry of Economy, is responsible for the preparation of the proposed Coal Sector&#13;
Restructuring Implementation Assistance Project. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will build&#13;
upon the current PPU in terms of staffing and lessons learned. The PIU, to be entitled&#13;
"REFORMUGOL", is planned to be established in June 1996 in the form of a non-commercial&#13;
foundation. The Presidium of the Coal Commission would be the Trustee Council overseeing the&#13;
PIU. Staffing of PIU is expected to be built up gradually, first with the appointment of the Director&#13;
General, the Director for Subsidy Management and a deputy director to coordinate activities under&#13;
the proposed Project. In addition, other key managers are expected to be appointed shortly, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7                                                                         73&#13;
two directors to cover: (a) institutional support for the Coal Commission; and (b) monitoring and&#13;
information on restructuring, respectively. PPU would be responsible for managing the bidding&#13;
for this assignment (with the assistance of a Financial Advisor) and the PIU would be&#13;
responsible for entering into a contract with the selected auditor.&#13;
7.    Strengthening of Subsidy Management. This assignment is part of a program planned&#13;
to strengthen the subsidy management system in the coal sector. Based on the diagnostic review&#13;
and recommended improvements to be developed under this assignment, the Russian authorities&#13;
may opt for a second phase program to strengthen the financial control of subsidies by the Coal&#13;
Commission. The overall program for strengthening subsidy management would include putting&#13;
in place an improved, computerized system for budget allocation, reporting requirements and&#13;
impact monitoring. The draft Terms of Reference for this program, which provides the context&#13;
but is beyond the scope of the present assignment, is attached for reference (Annex 5!.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
8.    The ultimate objective of this assignment is to enhance the transparency and financial&#13;
accountability of budget support for the coal sector in Russia, focusing on improvements in: (i)&#13;
budget allocation; (ii) reporting; (iii) monitoring; and (iv) audits. The specific objective of this&#13;
assignment is to (a) assess the status of recipients' compliance with the relevant laws, regulations&#13;
and contractual agreements on budget support for the coal sector; and (b) assess the internal&#13;
control system of the participating entities and recommend improvements for management of&#13;
budget support for the coal sector.&#13;
Scope&#13;
9.    The scope of audit would cover the segment of the entities' activities related to state&#13;
financing for the following five recipients during the first two quarters of 1996 (% of total&#13;
subsidy is indicated below): RosUgol (the audit scope would focus on its role as ultimate&#13;
recipient for the central reserve fund (9.89%) and leasing activities); and four ultimate recipients:&#13;
RostovUgol (11.8%); VorkutaUgol (6.4%), AIK "Sokolovskaya' (1.7%) and KuzbasslnvestUgol&#13;
(2%). Brief background information on these five organizations are attached (Attachment 2).&#13;
10.   The audit will be carried out in accordance with International Auditing Standards&#13;
Auditing (ISA, notably No. 24 on Special Purpose Audit Reports), and will include such tests&#13;
and controls as the auditor considers necessary under the circumstances. The audit will&#13;
determine, with respect to each entity, whether or not:&#13;
(a)   financial reports and related supporting schedules prepared by the entities being&#13;
audited give a true and fair view of the financial situation of resources and&#13;
expenditures related to state financing; this would include a reconciliation between&#13;
the amounts shown as received by organizations involved with all stages of&#13;
subsidy management, including the primary and ultimate recipients of subsidies&#13;
and those shown as disbursed by the Ministry of Finance, the regional Treasury&#13;
Department and the relevant commercial banks for each subcategory of subsidies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74                                                                             Annex 7&#13;
(b)   financial information is presented in accordance with established or stated criteria&#13;
by the Government and by RosUgol; in addition, identify specific instances where&#13;
the Russian criteria may differ from those presented in accordance with ISA and&#13;
the material effect thereof;&#13;
(c)   the use of state financing for each subcategory of subsidies has complied with the&#13;
relevant laws, regulations, policies and contractual agreements; and&#13;
(d)   the internal control systems used in administering state financing are adequate,&#13;
in particular the systems used for financial reporting and/or safeguarding&#13;
resources against waste, loss and misuse are suitably designed and implemented,&#13;
including comments on the adequacy of any computer-based systems. As part of&#13;
this review, the auditor will: (i) test whether internal control systems are&#13;
functioning in accordance with prescribed procedures; and (ii) examine the&#13;
primary recipient's system for monitoring ultimate recipients and test the&#13;
consistency of selected financial information between the primary recipients and&#13;
ultimate recipients. In addition, based on the auditor's diagnosis on any control&#13;
weaknesses, specific recommendations and terms of reference would be developed&#13;
by the auditor for a follow up program to strengthen the management of state&#13;
financing for the coal sector.&#13;
Ouput&#13;
11.   The audit report will confirm that the audit was made in accordance with international&#13;
auditing standards and the relevant Russian laws, regulations and contractual agreements on&#13;
budget support for the coal sector in Russia.&#13;
12.   The auditor's report on compliance for each of the five entities on their activities related&#13;
to state financing (broken down by each subcategory of subsidies) will contain:&#13;
(a)   A  statement of positive assurance with respect to those items tested for&#13;
compliance with laws, regulations and contracts pertaining to financial reports,&#13;
and any claims for advances and reimbursements (in particular, as indicated in&#13;
Attachment 1 on subsidy allocation categories, state financing in 1996 included&#13;
"repayment of 1995 arrears").&#13;
(b)   A statement of negative assurance on those items not tested and the reasons&#13;
therefor.&#13;
(c)    A summary of all instances of noncompliance. The report should indicate the&#13;
financial and legal impact and any other forms of the noncompliance, including&#13;
any errors, irregularities and actions not in accordance with the law.&#13;
(d)   An identification of total amounts of expenditures questioned, if any, for each&#13;
budget support transaction as a result of noncompliance or insufficient&#13;
documentation.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 7                                                                              77&#13;
Attachmnent 1&#13;
SUBSIDY ALLOCATION CATEGORIES&#13;
1.    The Federal Budget of the Russian Federation has set aside Rb. 10.4 trillion for state support&#13;
of the coal industry in 1996. For the first two quarters in 1996, the overwhelming majority of the&#13;
budget support has been allocated by RosUgol.&#13;
2.    When an aggregate level of budget support is settled upon and included in the budget,&#13;
Rosugol disaggregates this figure among six [seven] distinct categories: (i) obligations to which the&#13;
state has committed itself under the Tariff Agreements concluded with the unions in the industry; (ii)&#13;
Capital Investments; (iii) Social Sphere; (iv) Operational Losses; (v) Mine Closures; and (vi) the&#13;
Central Reserve Fund. A seventh category, Leasing, which had until recently been subsumed under&#13;
the Capital Investment category, has appeared as a main category in its own right in recent Rosugol&#13;
allocation schemes.&#13;
3.    Each of these main categories is composed of various elements, and allocation of state support&#13;
resources among these categories is driven by consolidating the requests for such support received&#13;
by Rosugol from the constituent coal companies designated by Rosugol as recipients of state support.&#13;
TawffAgreement Suppoil&#13;
4.    State support allocated to cover the cost of obligations incurred by the state under the terms&#13;
of what are essentially labor agreements concluded with unions representing the coal industry&#13;
workforce include: (a) Indexation of Minimum Wage Levels based on inflation rates; (b) Indexation&#13;
of Material Damage and Injury to Employees' Health and Lives [Disability Pay]; (c) Indexation of&#13;
One-Time Payments to Employees Being Pensioned; and (d) Arrears Associated with the 1995 Tariff&#13;
Agreement. 1995 arrears refer specifically to the payment of December [1995] wages, which&#13;
traditionally are paid in January using [1996] budget funds. Tariff Agreement obligations are not&#13;
limited exclusively to those set forth under the Tariff Agreement category, but include elements of&#13;
support allocated under other main categories of state support.&#13;
CaUal Investments [Development of PmnductionJ&#13;
5.    State financing of capital investments in the coal industry consists of the following elements&#13;
of support:&#13;
(a)   Repayment of 1995 Arrears     incurred in part because of insufficient funding provided by&#13;
the state for these purposes, and in part because of work&#13;
performed for which no financing was budgeted in 1995.&#13;
These debts account for all state support allocated under the&#13;
Capital Investment category in IQ96, and for 28% of the&#13;
Capital Investment allocation in 2Q96.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78                                                                                     Annex 7&#13;
(b)   Renewal of Productive Potential    this support is provided directly to the coal company and&#13;
covers both new construction as well as capacity expansion&#13;
at existing production units.&#13;
(c)    Rationalization of Production   is intended to finance the renovation and capital repair of&#13;
existing production units.&#13;
(d)   Regional Contracts, Agreements,   commits coal companies to the rehabilitation (or completion&#13;
and Protocols (Social Sphere)   of construction) of social sphere assets prior to their&#13;
transfer to municipal administration.&#13;
(e)   Investment Programs              pertains to investments managed by Investment Companies&#13;
(to which financing is provided) rather than by coal&#13;
companies themselves.&#13;
(f)    Modernization of Coal&#13;
Washeries/Preparation Plants&#13;
(g)   Acquisition of Equipment         This element, established as a main category for purposes&#13;
(Leasing)                       of state support allocation in recent Rosugol revisions of&#13;
the draft allocation plan, is intended to cover big ticket&#13;
items (drag lines, conveyor systems, etc.) which coal&#13;
companies purportedly cannot afford to purchase outright.&#13;
Rosugol has two operational departments - one for&#13;
underground mining and another for surface mining -&#13;
which acquire this high-value equipment based on requests&#13;
from coal companies/production units and lease it out to&#13;
coal companies. The equipment is considered to be state&#13;
property, and lease payments made to Rosugol are returned&#13;
to the Federal Treasury as repayment for the equipment&#13;
purchases.&#13;
(h)   Agreements of Shared             Refer to arrangements with military-industrial complex&#13;
Participation                    plants to develop and produce equipment and materials&#13;
needed by the coal industry which heretofore had not been&#13;
manufactured in Russia.&#13;
(i)    Central Fund                    This has been described as the Capital Investment&#13;
contribution to the Central Reserve Fund.&#13;
6.     All investments are to be based on specific projects and feasibility studies. Profitability of a&#13;
coal company is considered, and coal companies receive support earmarked for specific projects at&#13;
specific production units.&#13;
Social Sphere [Curent Expenses]&#13;
7.     Support for maintenance and operation of social assets not yet transferred to municipal&#13;
administration is allocated among the following subcategories: (a) housing stock; (b) kindergartens;&#13;
(c) therapeutic spas; (d) socio-cultural structures/assets ([stadiums, boilers, etc.]); (e) discounted/free&#13;
coal for pensioners (six tons per pensioner per year is the standard allotment); (f) other social sphere&#13;
expenses (medicine, etc.); and (g) repayment of 1995 arrears. These arrears accrued because 1995&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7                                                                              79&#13;
funding was insufficient, boilers did not pay for coal, kdndergartens did not pay for food, etc. (other&#13;
subcategories generated similar debts as well).&#13;
Opentional Losses&#13;
8.    Operational losses are provided to those companies which are not able to cover the costs of&#13;
production of their production units on the basis of coal sales receipts. These subsidies are calculated&#13;
quarterly in order to keep in step with changing prices.&#13;
Mine Closures&#13;
9.    State support aimed at the liquidation of non viable production units is allocated along the&#13;
following lines:&#13;
(a)  Technical Work on Mine Closures    Technical mine closure activities include:&#13;
1.    Design work and Consulting (which&#13;
covers the cost of preparing Feasibility&#13;
Studies).&#13;
2.    Expenditures on filling in shafts and&#13;
structures of connected installations.&#13;
3.    Expenditures on environmental protection&#13;
and recultivation.&#13;
4.    Removal of mine communication&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
(b)  Continuation of the Provision of   Costs associated with the provision of such&#13;
Essential Services during the     essential services include: Material expenditures;&#13;
Closure Process                   Wages; Social sphere supplements; Depreciation&#13;
of fixed assets (excluding per ton rates); Other&#13;
expenditures; Taxes; and Supplemental payments&#13;
to the working disabled.&#13;
(c)  Severance Payments                 The several manifestations of severance pay are:&#13;
Compensation to workers made redundant as a&#13;
result of workforce reduction; One-time&#13;
assistance to pensioners upon retirement;&#13;
Compensation for unused leave; Shipment of&#13;
household belongings and relocation of families;&#13;
and Other.&#13;

(d)  Housing Construction              State support is to be provided for the&#13;
construction of housing for workers laid off from&#13;
the industry. With regard to support under this&#13;
category in connection with the closure of&#13;
Promyshlennaya mine, costs associated with the&#13;
completion of construction of housing in Vorkuta&#13;
and with the acquisition of apartments (ostensibly&#13;
in regions to which redundant workers are being&#13;
relocated).&#13;
(e)  Capitalization of Funds to Cover  Capitalization refers to the contributions which&#13;
Continuing Payments to the Disabled  are made to a Fund which will succeed the&#13;
production unit (once the production unit is shut&#13;
down) as the provider of compensation to&#13;
workers injured or disabled on the job and no&#13;
longer able to work. These payments continue&#13;
until death and are in addition to state-provided&#13;
pensions. The level of contribution to be made by&#13;
a coal company is calculated on a per&#13;
worker/company/region basis.&#13;
(f)  Supplemental Payments to the      Although production has ceased at the production&#13;
Working Disabled, Free Coal       unit in advance of closure, free coal delivered&#13;

produce non-coking coal) is provided to working&#13;
pensioners employed to assist with mine closure.&#13;
(g)  Diversification                   This subcategory covers costs associated with job&#13;
creation and retraining activities.&#13;
Centmrl Reserve Fund&#13;
10.   The Central Reserve Fund is designed to provide the coal industry with a rapid response&#13;
capability in the event of emergencies, disasters, and the like. Commissions which investigate the&#13;
cause of such calamities are also financed out of the Central Reserve Fund. The Fund, maintained&#13;
by RosUgol, is allocated an amount of state support equivalent to as much as 10% of the amount&#13;
allocated to each of the main categories of state support listed above.&#13;

Anadiment 2&#13;
BRIEF BACKGROUND ON FVE ORGANIZATIONS TO BE AUDITED&#13;
1.    RosUgo&#13;
a. Location - Moscow.&#13;
b.Dcripojn - RosUgol was created as Russia's State Coal Company in Spring 1993 before&#13;
which the Russian Coal Corporatization carried out many of the State industry functions. Rosugol,&#13;
by decree, expires as an entity in Summer 1996 and by Presidential Decree 168, February 9, 1996,&#13;
will become the Russian Coal Company.&#13;
2.    RosUgol is seen as the center of Russia's coal sector; there are tangible and intangible&#13;
connections to Rosugol amongst Russia's 29 coal associations and even its ten independent&#13;
mines/enterprises. RosUgol is highly engaged in sector policy development, equipment leasing,&#13;
reaUlocation of profits and investment in Russia's coal regions.&#13;
3.    Coal is produced both in deep and surface mines and ranges in quality; preparation facilities&#13;
are generally servicing three or more mines and not modernized. Transport is controlled by a&#13;
combination of Ministry of Rails, Ports and local mediators generally working on behalf of regional&#13;
coal companies or Rosugol in transporting the coal.&#13;
(i)   number of mines - there are varying estimates as to the exact number of functioning&#13;
mines, surface and deep, in Russia. Rosugol lists 280 mines while figures range from&#13;
260 to 303; Rosugol policy generally impacts on all of these mine enterprise activities&#13;
in some way.&#13;
(ii)   number of employees - Rosugol estimates that in Moscow, 500 Rosugol employees&#13;
are working; there are strong indications that following a Democratic Victory in the&#13;
Presidential elections, that up to 300 of these employees will be laid off. There are&#13;
minimal Rosugol staff at certain regional levels.&#13;
(iii)  annual produco - Rosugol claims that in 1995 production was 220 million tons&#13;
nationwide and that profits were obtained.&#13;
(iv)   projected subsidies 1996 - the approved federal budget for 1996 for the Russian coal&#13;
sector is 7.4 trillion rubles federal monies and 3.0 trillion rubles via foreign loans; a&#13;
total of 10.4 trillion rubles or over 2 billion US dollars.&#13;
4.    RostovUgol - Shakty, Rostov.&#13;
a.    Locaton - approximately 880 kilometers from Moscow, Rostov-on-Don (the Don&#13;
River) is located in southem Russia closer to ports and local transport than most other&#13;
coal regions. Shakty is a particularly poor mining community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82                                                                            Annex 7&#13;
b.    Description -&#13;
(i)   number of mines - There are 17 mines operating under the auspices of&#13;
Rostovugol; the mines are deep and part of the Donbass coal basin which&#13;
carries into Ukraine.&#13;
(ii)   number of employees - 1995 figures reflect that 66,204 people were employed&#13;
under Rostovugol and that the projection for 1996 is 65,074 employees.&#13;
(iii)  annualproducin - estimated 11,565,000 tons in 1995.&#13;
(iv)   projected subsidies for first half 1996 - 313,514,000,000 rubles.&#13;
5.    VorkutaUgol&#13;
a.    Location - approximately 1,980 kilometers from Moscow, the city of Vorkuta is&#13;
located at the 67th parallel or 42 kilometers above the Arctic Circle.&#13;
b.    Description - because of its location, the region experiences up to ten months winter;&#13;
rising transportation costs have negatively impacted on coal sector development in&#13;
limiting access to market. Water transport is not consistent in light of freezing&#13;
temperatures. Still, as harsh as transport conditions are, Vorkutaugol remains,&#13;
nonetheless, closer to certain markets than its Siberians counterparts.&#13;
6.    VorkutaUgol is the first coal association where a complete mine closing took place. Two&#13;
hours north of Vorkuta in the mine settlement of Halmer-Yu, a mine with up to 90 degree slopes and&#13;
extremely harsh mining conditions was closed between 1993 and 1996. Approximately 5,000 people&#13;
were relocated.&#13;
7.    VorkutaUgol is strongly connected to Rosugol.&#13;
(i).   number of mines - There are now 11 mines operating under Vorkutaugol with three&#13;
undergoing closing processes. Vorkutaugol is the sole coal company in this region,&#13;
however, the independent mine of Vorgashorskaya also is located in Vorkuta and&#13;
became independent in 1992.&#13;
(ii)   number of employees - 1995 figures reflect that 29,874 people were employed under&#13;
Vorkutaugol with 3,396 employees at Vorgashorskaya Mine. Projections for 1996 are&#13;
26,591 under Vorkutaugol and 3,378 at Vorgashorskaya Mine.&#13;
(iii) annual production - 1 million tons.&#13;
(iv)   projected subsidies for first half of 1996 - 161,240,000,000 rubles.&#13;
8.    KuzbasslnvestUgol- Kemerovo.&#13;

a.    Location - approximately 2,960 kilometers from Moscow, located in western Siberia.&#13;
b.    Description - KuzbasslnvestUgol is not a coal company, but rather, a company&#13;
created approximately 18 months ago to address issues of "diversifying" the sector,&#13;
developing business and investment, creating jobs and divesting the coal companies&#13;
of non-core enterprises where possible.&#13;
9.    The company is directly linked with Rosugol where, in Moscow, "RosInvest" serves a&#13;
parallel function. KuzbassInvestUgol is independent of coal enterprises to some extent (eg. building&#13;
local housing and selling to coal enterprises) but coal company officials work with and in&#13;
KuzbasslnvestUgol as well.&#13;
(i)   number of mines - by virtue of its description, there are no coal mines working under&#13;
the auspices of KuzbasslnvestUgol.&#13;
(ii)   projected subsidies in first half of 1996 - 968,000,000 rubles.&#13;
10.   Sokolovskaya - Kuzbass&#13;
a.    Location - western Siberia&#13;
b.    Description - an investment company working with Rosugol focused on local&#13;
development including mine construction and general construction.&#13;
(i) projected subsidies in first half of 1996 - 63,100,000 rubles.&#13;

PREPARATION OF BUSINE PLANS:&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Backgmund&#13;
1.    Draft Govemmental Decree on reorganization of "Rosugol" into open-end joint stock&#13;
company stipulates that decision of the Govemment about transferring to the charter capitals of the&#13;
coal companies of state-owned blocks of shares of joint-stock companies which are dependent on the&#13;
correspondent coal companies should be implemented in the presence of business plans. Business&#13;
plans are to be aimed at the creating profitable coal companies by means of closure of unprofitable&#13;
mines, labor efficiency increase and other measures. It is desirable that business plans include&#13;
preliminary investigation of the possibilities of investments in coal mining or preparation. Starting&#13;
from 1997, business plan will be included in the agreements between leading and ultimate recipients&#13;
of the state support as a necessary part of application for state support.&#13;
Objective&#13;
2.    The main objective of this component of the TA is to build the capacity of the regional coal&#13;
companies to prepare business plans.&#13;
Strategy&#13;
3.    The purpose of producing a business plan is to:&#13;
*     make explicit the assumptions on which the forward planning and projections for the&#13;
business are based&#13;
*     set out the projections for price trends, sales volumes, market share, production costs,&#13;
profitability, cash flow etc.&#13;
formalize the economic evaluation of production units, and the identification of&#13;
uneconomic units for closure&#13;
formalize the economic evaluation and justification for capital expenditure projects to&#13;
improve existing production or generate new production capacity&#13;
prepare a coordinated timetable for significant business developments (including&#13;
closures and capital expenditure)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86                                                                              Annex 8&#13;
*     investigate strategy options, and identify the sensitivity of the performance of the&#13;
business to changes in the external economic environment of internal risk factors.&#13;
Approach&#13;
4.    It is proposed that a two-pronged approach is adopted to the provision of technical assistance&#13;
on the development of business plans, involving a primary consulting firm and a regional consulting&#13;
firm. A Primary consulting firm to establish overall standards and methodology to be applied to all&#13;
business plans, who will serve as an overseer of selection and management of qualified firms to work&#13;
with each coal company (selected from short lists of qualified firms with experience with the local&#13;
conditions prevailing in the specific coal region). The primary firm shall have demonstrated&#13;
experience in the development of business plans for the energy sector and experience working in&#13;
Russia and/or a working relationship with Russian firms with experience in the energy sector. After&#13;
the selection of the primary consulting firm, a step-by-step approach is proposed as follows:&#13;
Fust Step: Review the relevant Russian laws and regulations and existing documentation on&#13;
the creation of regional coal companies and business plans.&#13;
Second Step: Preparation of draft framework of business plans for all regional coal&#13;
companies, to be approved by the Coal Commission.&#13;
Third Step: TA for the preparation of business plans for 4 pilot coal companies.&#13;
Four Step: Based on the experience gained under the pilot, TA for the preparation of&#13;
business plans for additional 16 - 20 coal companies.&#13;
Specific Activities to be Accomplished by the Primary Consulting FHrm:&#13;
(i)    Ensure that the Business Plan framework would provide a basis for attracting external&#13;
capital investment to the regional coal companies;&#13;
(ii)   Liaise with the PIU, and will be expected to have either in-house or joint venture&#13;
expertise to ensure compliance with Russian regulations and standards;&#13;
(iii)   Prepare and submit for approval a proposed business plan framework;&#13;
(iv)   Assist the PIU to select, by competitive tender, consulting firms with experience in&#13;
the specific region for each participating regional coal company;&#13;
(v)   Prepare and conduct seminars for the regional consulting companies to build their&#13;
capacity in coal sector business plan preparation; in particular, the seminars will&#13;
explain the business plan framework, and provide guidance on the preparation&#13;
process;&#13;
(vi)   Work with the regional coal companies to prepare a draft business plan specifically&#13;
tailored to meet the needs of that region and the specific characteristics of each mine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 8                                                                              87&#13;
site(s). The primary consultants will review the draft business plan and propose&#13;
revisions as necessary.&#13;
Specific Activities to be Accomplished by Regional Consuling Finns&#13;
5.    The regional consultant will review the proposed revisions with the regional coal company&#13;
and, working together, will prepare a revised business plan.&#13;
Conflis of Interest&#13;
6.    The business plans will contain commercially confidential infornation relating to the regional&#13;
coal companies. In an environment where changes in the structure of ownership and subsidy&#13;
management will introduce a greater degree of competition among coal companies, it will be&#13;
important to provide safeguards for the confidentiality of this information. Such safeguards might&#13;
include:&#13;
*     requiring the regional coal companies to approve the selection of the sub- consulting&#13;
firm that will assist in the preparation of their business plan.&#13;
-     enabling the IAC to require the trust managers of each coal company receiving state&#13;
support funds to submit, for such companies, an annual business plan conforming&#13;
with the approved framework; in the case of coal companies which do not receive&#13;
state support funds, the IAC would place no obligation on the relevant trust manager&#13;
to submit an annual business plan.&#13;
3     requiring, prior to their appointment, the primary consultant to demonstrate that they&#13;
have no connection with or interest in the coal sector (or, that any such connection&#13;
or involvement will not give rise to a conflict of interest).&#13;
Reports&#13;
7.    The primary consultant will be required to submit to the PIU:&#13;
(a)   an inception report (within 30 days of beginning services) outlining the work schedule&#13;
proposed and activities for the first 3 months of the program;&#13;
(b)   a quarterly report detailing activities undertaken and projections of work for the next&#13;
quarter, problems encountered, recommendations for future actions, and status of&#13;
overall program effectiveness.&#13;
(c)    a mid-term report establishing progress towards program objectives.&#13;
Qualificaons Required&#13;
8.    The primary consultant will be expected to have demonstrated experience in the preparation&#13;
of business plans for restructuring programs in the energy fields, with emphasis on the coal sector&#13;
highly desirable. The firm should have experience working in the area comprising the Russian&#13;

RUSSAN FEDERATION&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
MANAGEMENT/FiNANCIAL TRAINING:&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    As market reforms in the coal sector continue to take place, the responsibilities of&#13;
managers at all levels is increasing. The former responsibilities of meeting five year plans and&#13;
production goals have expanded to include structuring the enterprise, achieving profit, managing&#13;
personnel, and maintaining relations with consumers.&#13;
2.    Experience in market management is greadly lacking in Russia's coal sector; skills&#13;
currently used are generally a mix of Soviet-style management with sporadic attempts to&#13;
introduce more market-oriented methods of management. The skills which are lacking are&#13;
extremely basic in market terms, but nonetheless crucial to effective management.&#13;
3.    It is important to recognize how lacking management skills are not only for regional and&#13;
local coal enterprise managers, but for non-coal enterprises and trade unions. Many of the skills&#13;
which industry managers must now acquire will also serve to build capacity of other structures&#13;
in coal regions.&#13;
Approach&#13;
4.    A Business Center structure already in operation in Russia, if not Russian coal regions,&#13;
would ideally serve as a model for replication in the coal regions. This structure should focus&#13;
on local staffing and ongoing in-house training as well as the provision of information and&#13;
services.&#13;
5.    The center should focus on developing or enhancing efforts in five coal regions (Tula,&#13;
Rostov, Vorkuta, Kuzbass and Urals) where ongoing training and access to management training&#13;
materials will function. The center must have the capacity to present training in areas outside&#13;
of the center location and will coordinate efforts with those on "Business Planning",&#13;
"Encouraging Investment", "Industrial Relations", and "Community Development" programs&#13;
included in this TA program.&#13;
6.    Training programs and dissemination of management training materials may be conducted&#13;
at the centers or at the site of training outside of the center (e.g., coal enterprise). It is&#13;
understood that different approaches may necessarily be applied in different regions.&#13;
7.    The center will work in close coordination with the Inter-Agency Coal Commission and&#13;
PIU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
90                                                                          Annex 9&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
Task 1: To assess the status of management training operations in the identified coal&#13;
regions including assessment of institutes, coal and non-coal enterprises and local&#13;
government.&#13;
Task 2: To establish or enhance training center operations in the five coal regions&#13;
including technical support and staffing. Identify training materials which are already&#13;
developed and need to be developed and modify in accordance with coal and non-coal&#13;
enterprise needs.&#13;
Task 3: Submission of materials now used for management training to the PIU including:&#13;
Personnel Management           Organizational Structures&#13;
Financial Management           Consumer Awareness&#13;
"How To's" - run a meeting; write/present a speech&#13;
Inter-Industry Relations       Industry Relations&#13;
Marketing/Sales                Civil Code practices&#13;
Investment/Credits             Environmental Management&#13;
Task 4: Work with local counterparts per IAC and PIU coordination in selecting&#13;
management training participants; a system of training requests from beneficiaries must&#13;
be formulated and used. Ideally training will occur both at the centers and at the coal&#13;
mines and non-coal enterprises in response to enterprise request.&#13;
Task 5: Present training and pertinent training materials to selected participants&#13;
according to training plan developed for particular course or enterprise/union.&#13;
Task 6: Develop a "Train the Trainers" program through which local participants will&#13;
be given the opportunity to reach out to additional coal regions and present similar&#13;
training.&#13;
Task 7: Develop and implement "Follow-On Training" for participants where increased&#13;
levels of knowledge and participation will result.&#13;
Task 8: Where possible, assist in direct application of management training at local&#13;
enterprise or union (eg. consultant may attend meeting, speech, advise on organizational&#13;
charts, review program budgets).&#13;
Task 9: In offering training, both "knowledge" and "skills" training should be&#13;
video/audio taped both for future review as well as immediate review by participants of&#13;
training sessions. Participant and trainer feedback will provide useful information for&#13;
continued training.&#13;

Task 10: Where funding permits, development of overseas training which will build on&#13;
knowledge obtained during training; ideally, potential trainers should be collected and&#13;
will receive such extended training in a Western European or United States program.&#13;
TerVn of Work&#13;

ANNEX 10&#13;
TECHNCAL ASSISrANCE ON TRUsT MANAGEMENT:&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The principles and guidelines of reforming the coal industry management system are set&#13;
out in "The Basic Trends of the Restructuring". Presidential Decree, No. 168, February 9,&#13;
1996, "On Measures to Improve the Structure of the Russian coal industry" is of paramount&#13;
importance for the implementation of the above principles and guidelines. In compliance with&#13;
the Decree, by end June 1996 the Government will convert the state company Rosugol into an&#13;
open joint-stock company.&#13;
2.    By the end of October 1996 the Government will:&#13;
(a)   approve rules governing the trust management of state shares in coal companies,&#13;
including those covering appointment of new trust managers and their obligations&#13;
to the federal authorities;&#13;
(b)   transfer to the charter capital of these selected companies the state shares in&#13;
related companies, as envisaged in Presidential Decree no. 168; and&#13;
(c)   issue to potential bidders for trust management contracts for the selected&#13;
companies all of the information required by them for the preparation of their&#13;
bids.&#13;
3.    Using this mechanism, by the end of December 1996 the Government will ensure that&#13;
new trust managers will control coal companies that produced in aggregate not less than 65&#13;
million tons of coal in 1995, i.e., approximately 25% of the volume of coal produced in the&#13;
Russian Federation.&#13;
4.    Not later than three months after the competitive selection of trust managers of state&#13;
shares in the above-mentioned coal companies the relevant Federal executive bodies will review&#13;
the business plans submitted by the new trust managers.&#13;
5.    As far as other currently operating coal companies and joint-stock companies are&#13;
concerned, by end December 1996, the Coal Commission will define measures to accelerate&#13;
demonopolization in the coal industry in 1997.&#13;
&#13;

Apprach&#13;
7.    Introducing trust managers other than RosUgol is proposed to take place in two distinct&#13;
phases. Firstly, the managers of one or two transformed regional companies will assume trust&#13;
management of the state's shares in them. As this process is expected to begin as soon as possible,&#13;
legal advice will be arranged to be made immediately available to the Government. It is expected that&#13;
the consultant will find an initial legal framework in place. Copies of all relevant legal material will&#13;
be made available.&#13;
8.    The second phase will concentrate on attracting outside trust managers, and will require a&#13;
consultancy firm to examine the feasibility of this and then organize a suitable bidding process. This&#13;
Terms of Reference is for this initial feasibility work and subsequent recruitment of trust managers.&#13;
Specific Activiies to be Accomplished by Consultant&#13;
9.    The PPU will have appointed legal experts to advise the Government on how its interest can&#13;
best be served in the trust management contracts. These legal experts will have drawn up prototype&#13;
trust management contracts containing very strict obligations on the trust manager, so that the initial&#13;
non-RosUgol trust managers (drawn from the coal companies themselves) are sufficiently controlled.&#13;
10.   A consultancy firm, with experience in issues of management of companies owned by the&#13;
state, is required to devise a bidding process for future outsider trust management contracts.&#13;
Task 1: The consultancy firm meets representatives from various potential trust managers&#13;
outside the coal companies (investment funds, banks, Russian consultancy firms, RosUgol,&#13;
Rostopprom, foreign coal companies), and builds up a picture of what rewards and&#13;
responsibilities (including penalties) the interested parties consider realistic.&#13;
Task 2: Prepare report on (a) list of potential organizations to invite; (b) scope of the bidding&#13;
document; (c) implications for the draft trust management contract, and discusses and agrees&#13;
with the Government.&#13;
Task 3: The consultancy firm assists the Government in defining the eligibility criteria for&#13;
trust managers, taking into account the issues raised in the meetings in Task 3.&#13;
Task 4: The consultancy firm works together with the legal experts and the Government to&#13;
revise trust management contracts ready for the open bidding process (these may be slightly&#13;
less strict than those for the initial insider trust management contracts).&#13;
Task 5: Invitations to bid for two pilot trust management contracts are written by the&#13;
Government with the help of the consultancy firm, and then distributed and/or published. At&#13;
this stage, it is envisaged that bids will take the form of proposed trust management fees, with&#13;
the lowest acceptable fee winning the contract.&#13;
Task 6: The consultancy firm assists the Government in managing the bidding process, and&#13;
assists in the assessment of the bids received for the two pilot invitations.&#13;

COAL SECTOR RESTRUCTRING IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANcE PROJECT&#13;
RuSSIAN FDERATION&#13;
ANNEX 12&#13;
TA ON MINE CLOSURE PROPOSALS:&#13;
DRAFT ITRMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Main Guidelinesfor Restnrcturing Russia's Coal Industry, approved by the Inter-Agency&#13;
Coal Commission, July 14, 1995, provide an implementation framework for closing non-viable and&#13;
unprofitable coal mines as a component of overall coal sector restructuring. The objectives of these&#13;
guidelines are to:&#13;
*     enhance the efficiency of the coal sector;&#13;
*     enhance miner safety;&#13;
*     reduce the amount of funds allocated to support coal sector enterprises which cannot&#13;
meet expenses from coal sales;&#13;
*     increase the amount of funds allocated for social services;&#13;
*     make coal companies more attractive for investors;&#13;
*     reduce the negative environmental effects of non-viable and unprofitable mines.&#13;
2.    Depending upon the form of their organization and operational cost, unprofitable mines are&#13;
to be closed in accordance with Russian Civil Code, Banknuptcy of Enterprises and other legal acts.&#13;
In addressing the specific features of closing coal mines, "The Main Principles of Closing Non-Viable&#13;
and Unprofitable Mines in Russia" was approved by the Inter-Agency Coal Commission in May&#13;
1994.&#13;
3.    The existing mine closure guidelines have a number of drawbacks. Specifically, they do not&#13;
provide for the following:&#13;
*     participation of all stakeholders (e.g., enterprise managers and municipal authorities)&#13;
in determining whether a coal mine should be categorized as un-economic or non-&#13;
viable;&#13;
*     detailed decision-making processes to close a mine under the relevant laws and&#13;
regulations;&#13;
*     whether a coal mine owner can determine its closure;&#13;
*     whether or not state financing of mine closure will commence only when the owner&#13;
decides to close the mine in a manner consistent with prevailing laws and regulations;&#13;
*     the role of the Inter-Agency Coal Commission in overseeing the closure process;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
100                                                                          Annex 12&#13;
*     specification of information to be presented to the relevant state agencies for planning&#13;
and control of budget expenditures to cover mine closure costs;&#13;
4.    Based on recent experience, RosUgol has drafted a new version of the guidelines, entitled to&#13;
"Ihe Main Guidelines for Closing Non-Viable and Unprofitable Coal Mines". This document was&#13;
approved in February 1996 subject to the addition of provisions to ensure the targeted use of budget&#13;
funds allocated for mine closures, guarantees of employment and social security for redundant&#13;
miners, and strengthening the role of municipal authorities in the implementation of socio-economic&#13;
programs in coal mining regions.&#13;
Objecdes&#13;
5.    The main objective is to develop an improved version of "The Guidelines for Closing Non-&#13;
Viable and Unprofitable Mines in Russia" taling into account IAC's comments listed above and to&#13;
design a set of measures to ensure the practical implementation of closing non-viable and unprofitable&#13;
mines.&#13;
6.    Tasks. These include the following:&#13;
Task 1. To review the existing procedure for closing non-viable and unprofitable mines; to&#13;
identify problems in the procedure, and to identify parts of the procedure which should&#13;
remain.&#13;
3     To examine the existing practice of closuring non-viable and unprofitable mines of&#13;
various institutional and legal issues with the goal of standardizing decision-making,&#13;
planning and accounting procedures.&#13;
*     To identify possible problems and conflicts existing in current mine closures by&#13;
reviewing actual cases of mine closures.&#13;
*     To standardize the legal documents regulating the mine closure procedures.&#13;
Task 2. To revise 7he Main Guidelines of Mine Closures, taking into account the IAC's&#13;
comments and to recommend improvements in current mine closure practices. This version&#13;
will provide options for closing mines, strengthen the legal basis of measures related to&#13;
closing, introduce a schedule of budget financing for mine closing, minimize the negative&#13;
consequences of mine closing as a result of poor financing and lacking social security&#13;
measures for laid-off workers, their families, and pensioners and invalids who worked in the&#13;
coal industry, and assurance that no mine be closed and that no worker be laid-off without&#13;
corresponding social security which must be financially covered.&#13;
Task 3. Prepare suggestions for preparation of mine closure plans by coal enterprises, based&#13;
on well-determined decisions wherein mines have been placed in categories such as viable,&#13;
non-viable, etc.&#13;
*     Criteria should be designed for a coal enterprise which consists of one or several&#13;
mines, and auxiliary or maintenance enterprises which would help in determining the&#13;
mine category.&#13;
&#13;

COAL SECTOR RESrRUCTURING IMPLEMENTATON AsSsTANcE PROJEcT&#13;
RussAN FEDERATION&#13;
ANNEx 13&#13;
MANAGING ENviRoNMENTAL REHABIITATON:&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The restructuring of the Russian coal industry will leave a residue of past environmental&#13;
damage that must addressed over an indefinite period of time. To ensure that these problems do not&#13;
hinder the process of breaking up and privatizing enterprises in the industry, it will be necessary to&#13;
develop institutional arrangements for dealing with them, including appropriate financial mechanisms.&#13;
2.    The potential costs of rehabilitating areas damaged by past mining activities have been&#13;
highlighted in the course of developing and implementing a program of mine closures. However,&#13;
it should be stressed that the need to address these problems does not arise as a consequence of a&#13;
decision to close a mine. It applies equally to mines that continue to operate, but until now the costs&#13;
of rehabilitation have been either neglected or hidden by traditional arrangements operating within&#13;
a monolithic, state-owned industry.  Neither response is appropriate once the industry is&#13;
decentralized. Further, potential private investors will be understandably reluctant to accept open-&#13;
ended commitments with respect to the consequences of decisions over which they have no control.&#13;
Thus, resolution of the problems posed by environmental liabilities is an important element in&#13;
attracting investment into the competitive core of the industry.&#13;
3.    Coal mining can cause various kinds of environmental damage from the disturbance of&#13;
agricultural or other lands to water or air pollution associated with mining activities or the disposal&#13;
of mining wastes. Local environmental authorities in the coal basins have considerable experience&#13;
in working with coal mines to mitigate the impact of current mining operations on the environment.&#13;
These arrangements work as well as or better than other aspects of environmental management in&#13;
Russia, so there is no special need for technical assistance in this sphere. However, there is a&#13;
substantial residue of environmental damage -- disturbed lands, spoil heaps that may be prone to start&#13;
burning, subsidence, and acid drainage from old mine workings and waste sites. In principle, mines&#13;
or mining companies are responsible for mitigating or remedying the environmental damage. In&#13;
practice, they have little incentive or reason to do this, and it may not be possible to transfer the&#13;
responsibility to any successor body when mines close, merge, or are reorganized.&#13;
4.    The issue of cleaning up past environmental damage is not special to the coal industry.&#13;
Indeed, the environmental liabilities of the petroleum, chemical, and metallurgical sectors are likely&#13;
to be much larger than those of the coal industry. Unfortunately, too little thought has been given&#13;
to the problems raised by such liabilities when other industries were privatized either because it was&#13;
assumed that the industries would be able to meet the costs involved without too much strain or&#13;
because it was recognized that the worst liabilities would eventually finish up sooner or later as the&#13;
Government's responsibilities. Such neglect would not be acceptable in the coal industry both&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
104                                                                          Annex 13&#13;
because of the strength of feeling among the workforce about environmental damage caused by&#13;
mining in some areas and because of the fragmented nature of the industry.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
5.    Thus, a program  of work to develop mechanisms for managing the rehabilitation of&#13;
environmental damage linked to coal mining would be undertaken under the auspices of the Proposed&#13;
Coal Sector Restructuring Implementation Assistance Project. The objectives of this program would&#13;
be to:&#13;
(a)   assess the scale and nature of the environmental liabilities of the coal industry;&#13;
(b)   define criteria for setting priorities concerning the most urgent problems;&#13;
(c)   develop institutional arrangements and responsibilities for undertaking rehabilitation&#13;
either directly or via agents (such as local authorities and the independent coal&#13;
companies);&#13;
(d)   recommend financial arrangements for funding the costs of rehabilitation; and&#13;
(e)   initiate a program for remedying the most urgent and important problems.&#13;
Strategy and Approach&#13;
6.    A consulting firm is required to (i) visit the principal coal basins, (ii) review data on current&#13;
or potential future environmental liabilities, (iii) develop priorities for environmental rehabilitation&#13;
and land reclamation, (iv) estimate the costs of a medium-term program of work, (v) propose a&#13;
framework in which the responsibility for identifying, developing and managing the rehabilitation&#13;
projects is devolved to local authorities, and (vi) draw up recommendations for funding the&#13;
rehabilitation work. The federal Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and the Ministry&#13;
of Fuel and Energy have created a small group as a supervisory body. The authorities and&#13;
responsibilities of this group should be assesses by the consultant and recommendations as to its role&#13;
should be included in the final report.&#13;
