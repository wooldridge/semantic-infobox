This Collaboration Arrangement is en:ered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   THE GOVERNMENT OF CA 4ADA ACTING THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FORE  G N&#13;
AFFAIRS, TRADE AND DE% ELOPMENT, HEREIN REPRESENTED BY THE MINISTER F C'&#13;
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, headquartered at Gatineau, QC, Canada (the "Gove 'r r,ent&#13;
of Canada"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUF, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIh EN f&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), heac quartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, Us, , : le&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvar ik&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, Dt 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("MIGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, D( C 1133,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Group")&#13;
(each a "Signatory" and together, the "Signatories").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad internationa recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Inter It nal&#13;
Organizations (lOs), the G77 and the private sector represented by the B20 that investinj in the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging IVarkets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to aq: ind&#13;
access to basic services an( raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic r: /vth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on  Ji ing&#13;
sources of infrastructure finaice-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and cooi:1ir, ted&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize p ivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robLst pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects ani :l's is&#13;
understood to be the greates barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investm it&#13;
(D) Governments, development i nance institutions, donors, and private investors share an in  set in&#13;
developing the market for pr vate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand s di , in&#13;
the numbers of structurally s(,und and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual emir;: ice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range oi pr ate&#13;
investors that actively partic pate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will IE efit&#13;
from collective action betwe in this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowl fl( ! to&#13;
find solutions to complex iifrastructure financing challenges that no single institutio c uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, tre Signatories propose the establishment of a Global Irfras:r.i(: ure&#13;
Facility Partnership Program ("GIF"). The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at le: -E ing&#13;
the efforts of the wide range of institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infras:r.: ure&#13;
with the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prep :E on,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigation for individual infrastructure  investments. In this regard,  re  31F&#13;
aims to complement existin(I and proposed services and initiatives currently supportec :" the&#13;
Signatories and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to :&gt; E are&#13;
well-structured, infrastructur projects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for ac::en ing&#13;
the expertise of the Signatories and other GIF partners, in combination with guidan :( -om&#13;
prospective private sector fiianciers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to 1:h ave&#13;
greater leverage of official resources in the face of substantial EMDE infrastructure nE s:: -in&#13;
particular for large and comp ex projects with the potential to attract significant private cap 1 I&#13;
(F) The Signatories are now  inte-ested in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure I'z ility&#13;
Partnership Program, togethier with other partners.&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Signatories have t:ome to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facility Partnership Program Framework&#13;

understanding that while the 31F Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their collal c r ion,&#13;
they are of an indicative natu e and will continue to be developed amongst the Signatories ri&#13;
with other potential partners t ntil the GIF is formally established. The final version of these&#13;
objectives and principles will &gt;e agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in tie&#13;
agreement establishing the C IF.&#13;
1.2   The Signatories interd to work together with any additional participants who may t,&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the GIF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure pc jE ts&#13;
in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparati:)i,&#13;
provision of appropriate risk r nitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercia ir i&#13;
institutional investor engagement in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex pubf c-private partnerships and projects with potential for commei:: a&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastru:' u i&#13;
financing solutions that no sir gle institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coorc ir E on&#13;
resources in collaboration witi the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of th A Je&#13;
range of donor and developrr ent finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMD E&#13;
infrastructure, with the input z nd ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagemei t c uld&#13;
stretch from upstream support on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to dowr stream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemer t.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structure:&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GIF can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset cla 5s attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long t: i&#13;
assets in faster growing ecoromies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profile &#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to ooerate according to the following core principles, to be finalizE c )on&#13;
agreement among GIF partnors:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the arivate sector-specializing in project financing modalities U I  ill&#13;
draw together co'nparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing put lic goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly thosE&#13;
infrastructure prcjects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sust iinability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to t e&#13;
practice standarc s for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing t( c- cal&#13;
and financial resources of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mu :i a:  ral&#13;
development ins itutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in ar&#13;
innovative and floxible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greatE r&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the resources of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in t w&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF p, r ni rs&#13;
are expected to fall into one or more of the following categories:&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partneis-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF wi I :1:&#13;
considered Fund ng Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partn ars-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice ind support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-funde:1&#13;
activities and/or F rovision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity suppc r&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partners-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/or institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sove eign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as w( II,=&#13;
other multilateral or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure pro ects, to be invited into discussions related to project prepara ik r&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional investment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Cc uncil is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmin1&#13;
management and use of funds, and development of operational policies and procedures; e 1:1&#13;
hold the GIF Management Ur it (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, witt advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The cornpo! iic of&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is prop( se: to&#13;
comprise representatives of F unding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Councl comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Dir( zck&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer of the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facilil aE&#13;
coordination of GIF activities 3nd support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve :i&#13;
sounding board, providing gu dance and support for GIF Management, and in particular wi re&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be admi iistered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicate( e: m&#13;
established for this purpose (:he GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will fu 1:i &gt;n&#13;
as a coordinating body as prcjects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mov :&#13;
toward technical support and financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead in( i: al&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implementation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partne&#13;
institutions, coordinated by the GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governme i;&#13;
according to specific project requirements and the project origination processes. Compos :i  n of&#13;
the implementation teams m; iy vary according to the need of individual projects and govem nr nts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection cr teria and processes could be developed to reflect the follov iiI&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Inipact-projects that support the development goals of the GI&#13;
partner institutior s;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-pro ects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities :it:&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-pr jects that require multiple parties to come together to providi&#13;
structuring, arrarging and financial support, and/or projects which require a bl i!t of&#13;
financial instrum)nts; and&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impac -projects that have significant potential to achieve financial / a: lity,&#13;
leverage public funds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- s. 1 1&#13;
as through Public -Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's sei vice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastructure investments that have global public good characteristics  ich&#13;
as climate friendly-project. that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisior cf&#13;
infrastructure services; and tiade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconne t v  y&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of support provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with a3 '  w&#13;
to complementing the resources and support already available from partner entities and ot iir&#13;
funding mechanisms. During :he GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac:ii: as,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; pro ect definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr :(r 1g;&#13;
and legal, regula ory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii)  Project preparation and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PPP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction supp ort and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, anc design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrangi ig and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financi&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-iicluding in particular the management of environmental and :Uc 3l&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastri cl:c. e&#13;
projects in supporting sustainable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements a&#13;
external implementing entitie:; under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards anc t ar&#13;
standards and policies, and cevelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for Gl&#13;
Technical Partners who are expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activitieE&#13;
