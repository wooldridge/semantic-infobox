consumers flow through a gross pool, while a&#13;
net pool handles payments only for the part of&#13;
electricity deliveries not covered by bilateral&#13;

In a country being pulled in all directions by&#13;
culturally and politically distinct regions, the&#13;
government placed a high premium on the co-&#13;
hesive force that a technically and commer-&#13;
cially unified power system was expected to&#13;
provide. A gross pool was expected to increase&#13;
this cohesion. This feature, however, made the&#13;
treatment of delinquent customers more sus-&#13;
ceptible to political intervention because it&#13;
made it easier to spread the cost of nonpay-&#13;

            Electricity reform in Ukraine : the impact
            of weak goverance and budget crises
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Although reform of Ukraine's
            electricity sector is far from complete, the experience so
            far shows that ingrained attitudes are harder to change than
            written rules of the game. Moreover, the reemergence of old
            behavioral patterns during political, macroeconomic, or
            sectoral crises can quickly undermine early gains from
            reform. Thus the long time needed to achieve deep and
            irreversible changes places a high premium on stamina and
            patience for reformers. By contrast, and contrary to some
            predictions, in Ukraine it was relatively easy to put in
            place the basic systems for a functioning competitive
            electricity market. Dispatch center, generation, and
            distribution company employees quickly learned to work with
            the new procedures and demonstrated a remarkable ability to
            adapt imported solutions to local conditions.
