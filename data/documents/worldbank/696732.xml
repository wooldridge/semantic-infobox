&amp;#12;&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. THE ECONOMY AND LAND USE&#13;
1.1   The Lao economy is among the least developed in the world, with an average per&#13;
capita income of about US$290 (1994). With a population of about 4.5 million people&#13;
for a total area of 236,000 sq. km, the country has a low population density of 17 persons&#13;
per sq. km, but population is growing at 2.9 percent per year. About 89 percent of the&#13;
people live in some 11,000 rural villages, engaged mainly in agriculture which accounts&#13;
for about 55 percent of GDP. Approximately 87 percent of employment is in agriculture&#13;
which dominates land use.&#13;
1.2  In 1993-94, there was a total of 394,417 hectares (ha) of land in use and subject&#13;
to tax. Paddy and rice fields comprised 65 percent of the total area. Some 15 percent of&#13;
the Lao households were in possession of irrigated land and 64 percent possessed dry&#13;
land. The average size of cultivated holdings for Lao households is 1.4 ha. Only 29,928&#13;
ha of land were utilized for construction.&#13;
1.3   While the country is predominantly agricultural, it is the urban areas that are&#13;
experiencing the fastest growth, both in total population and household formation. For&#13;
example, the national population grew from 3.6 to 4.5 million or an increase of 24&#13;
percent, in the period 1985 to 1993, but the Vientiane municipality increased by 32&#13;
percent, from 381,000 to 503,000 people. The difference is more pronounced in terms of&#13;
household or family numbers. Nationally, the number of families or households increased&#13;
from 601,797 to 685,230, or 14 percent, from 1985 to 1993, compared to an increase of&#13;
33 percent for Vientiane, which increased from 61,561 to 81,643 households. As the&#13;
population and economic activities increase in urban areas, so does demand for land and&#13;
the need to improve efficiency of land use and land administration.&#13;
B. NEED FOR EFFICIENT LAND USE AND ADMINISTRATION&#13;
1.4   Since around 1986, the economy has been in transition from a centrally planned to&#13;
a market system. A major element of the Government's policy in supporting the&#13;
transition has been the development of efficient markets for land, capital and labor to&#13;
complement improvements in the capacity of the public sector to both plan and&#13;
implement development programs. Efficient land markets and security of land tenure, on&#13;
which they depend, are important in order to permit land to get allocated to its most&#13;
efficient use and users and to encourage land-related investments and sustainable use of&#13;
land. While land markets are now in existence, the difficulty is that they do not operate&#13;
efficiently, effectively or openly. Commercial investors are finding it difficult to obtain&#13;
access to land that is most appropriate for their investments. Land is being traded but the&#13;
turnover figures, as measured by recorded land transactions, are not high and transactions&#13;
are hampered by the problems of establishing occupancy and use ownership rights. There&#13;
is a prevalence of illegal possession, sale and use of land and a large number of court&#13;
cases relating to land, many of which are hampered by lack of ascertainable rights to and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
clear information on land; all these represent symptoms of an inefficient land market.&#13;
Moreover, the great majority of the sale transactions are not registered. And since land&#13;
registration is not common, there are foregone opportunities of using land as collateral to&#13;
obtain loans from banks.&#13;
1.5   Another missing link in the necessary framework for efficient land use has been&#13;
the absence of a land valuation profession and capacity in Lao PDR. A land valuation&#13;
function is important for both the Government and the private sector in their activities&#13;
related to economic development. The Government would benefit from an improved&#13;
valuation capacity, as it needs it to determine the values of land and other properties for&#13;
purposes of assessing rental tax, land registration fees and land tax. The Ministry of&#13;
Finance's (MOF) Department of State Assets (DSA) needs to develop a valuation&#13;
capacity to enable it to determine the most appropriate lease terms for the properties that&#13;
are being leased out to the private sector as well as compensation values for properties&#13;
acquired by the Government. On the private sector side, the banking industry represents&#13;
the largest known demand for valuation related services. Mortgage lending activity is&#13;
very small, due in large part to the lack of a complete and trusted system of registration&#13;
but also due to the lack of reliable estimates of value on which to base the loan.&#13;
1.6   Land titles were originally established with the creation of the Land Book in SR&#13;
1,912 and were kept in force under the Royal Order - Law No. 135 of 23 May 1958.&#13;
These titles certified ownership of land and were supported by cadastral plans and maps&#13;
for the towns of Vientiane, Pakse, Savannakhet, and Luang Prabang. While these&#13;
original records were not maintained, there were a number of subsequent initiatives made&#13;
for the establishment and maintenance of cadastral systems but they could not be&#13;
sustained and were eventually abandoned after 1975. After 1975, despite the fact that all&#13;
land became vested in the State, land use rights were informally recognized and a process&#13;
of administering and recording transactions with those rights developed. This basic&#13;
process is still in place today and, although the land use rights now have legal standing&#13;
and registration of transactions with those rights is required by law, the system is one of&#13;
registration of transactions not involving certification of title. Furthermore, even this&#13;
system is not in place uniformly in all areas of the country and, even in those areas in&#13;
which it is in place, it is not being fully used by the people.&#13;
1.7   The number of land parcels in Lao PDR is not known as data to determine the&#13;
exact number are not currently available. However, an estimate of 1.6 million land&#13;
parcels has been made. Although legislation to fully support registration of title to land is&#13;
not yet in place, the Lao PDR Government commenced in June 1994 a pilot project to&#13;
issue titles to land in Vientiane Prefecture, but only about 300 titles were issued. A&#13;
follow up Pilot Project issued about 1,000 titles between July 1995 and February 1996.&#13;
In Savannakhet province, a total ofjust 2,400 titles were issued by the end of 1995. Part&#13;
of the cause of low registration rates was lack of documentary evidence which will be&#13;
addressed under the proposed project. Approaches to addressing it are being tested in&#13;
operational trials which were initiated in July 1995 ahead of the project (see paras. 2.8-&#13;
2.11).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
1.8   Two important land administration and management challenges to the country&#13;
are: (i) the need for accelerated land registration and titling to enable the provision of&#13;
incentives to landholders to manage land resources efficiently and sustainably; and (ii)&#13;
the need to expand land titling programs so as to facilitate the development of mortgage&#13;
markets that are essential for financial sector development. The two challenges are&#13;
central to the justification and design of the proposed project.&#13;
C. THE COUNTRY'S LAND ADMINISTRATION STRATEGY&#13;
1.9   Since 1990, the Government has addressed the lack of comprehensive and&#13;
consistent land management and administration policy with increasing urgency. The&#13;
focus is on the need for more efficient and transparent land markets and their regulation&#13;
and for improvement in the sustainable management of land, water and forest resources&#13;
in rural areas. The Constitution promulgated in 1991 affirmed the rights of individuals to&#13;
use the land. The Fifth Party Congress (March 1991) identified the need to accelerate&#13;
land registration and issue land title certificates so that each plot will have a legal owner.&#13;
The policy elements outlined in the following paragraphs represent the next steps towards&#13;
achieving the goal of efficient land markets. Land management and administration&#13;
policies are reflected in the decrees that followed the promulgation of the Constitution in&#13;
1991. The five basic decrees are: Property Law (1990), Land Decree (99 PM), Land Tax&#13;
Decree (50 PM), Document Registration Decree (52 PM) and the Forest Management and&#13;
Land Use Decree (169 PM). A recently promulgated Decree (186 PM) covers the&#13;
allocation of forest lands with reference to allocation of lands to plantation forestry.&#13;
1.10  Key elements of land management policy, as reflected in the Decrees, are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   provision of a system of tradable occupancy and use rights and secure and&#13;
legally enforceable title for selected categories of land use (Decree 99);&#13;
(b)   increased emphasis on provision of incentives in the form of land rights&#13;
for community groups and villages in exchange for tax breaks and a&#13;
commitment to manage particular land categories such as community&#13;
forest land in a sustainable manner (Decrees 169 and 186); and&#13;
(c)   change in the role of the Government to emphasize zoning, demarcation&#13;
and provision of assistance to rural land users to improve productive and&#13;
sustainable land use practices (Decree 169).&#13;
1.11  For land administration, the key elements of policy are&#13;
(a)   improving resource mobilization from the allocation and transfer of land&#13;
through the introduction of a new set of land taxes and collection&#13;
arrangements including a registration and titling program (Decrees 50 and&#13;
99); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
(b)   establishing the institutional arrangements and capacities of the agencies&#13;
responsible for the implementation of land administration programs&#13;
including registration and titling (Decrees 52, 104 and 128).&#13;
1.12  The twin land management and administration policy objectives are to improve&#13;
resource management and the more productive use of land resources through provision of&#13;
incentives to users, and to improve the regulatory capacity of the Government to ensure&#13;
that the benefits of more efficient land markets are more equitably shared.&#13;
1.13  The Government's strategy has as its next step the implementation of a land&#13;
registration system and the issuing of titles to all landholders. This is recognized in the&#13;
current Public Investment Program 1994-2000 (PIP), which nominates Land Titling as a&#13;
key project requiring capital investment funds. The PIP states the Government's&#13;
commitment to the development of a land titling system so that clear land use rights can&#13;
be provided, private sector investment encouraged, credit markets developed and a source&#13;
of government revenue provided through the sale of land use rights and taxes on land&#13;
transactions.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR LAND ADMINISTRATION&#13;
1.14  Department of Land and Housinz Management (DOLHM). DOLHM is the core&#13;
national agency responsible for the design and implementation of land management and&#13;
administration programs. The mandate as defined by the Prime Minister's Office Decree&#13;
(No. 104) dated 6 July 1993 is to carry out, under the direction of the Land Re-&#13;
Management Committee, the design and supervision of national land registration and&#13;
titling programs through the offices of the provincial services. The DOLHM has limited&#13;
resources and capabilities, a factor that needs to be fully recognized in the formulation of&#13;
a national land registration program. The total staff of DOLHM are 19, of which 5 have&#13;
had university level training (3 with specific land related training), 9 have technical level&#13;
training (I with land training) and 4 have on the job training (3 with land related&#13;
training).&#13;
1.15  Department of State Assets (DSA). The DSA is responsible for the registration,&#13;
supervision and maintenance of the assets in the form of property, land and enterprises&#13;
owned by the State. The DSA is the holder of the national Government shares in&#13;
enterprises which are divested through privatization. The DSA has been the major player&#13;
in the privatization program and maintains a register of national Government entities that&#13;
have been privatized. The DSA is responsible for registering leases between foreign&#13;
investors and Lao entities relating to state property. It also maintains the register of all&#13;
leases between parties. Provincial level state assets divisions carry out the same functions&#13;
for provincial Government owned assets; so considerable overlap in functions occurs&#13;
particularly in Vientiane Prefecture where DSA carries out a hands on registration&#13;
program in parallel with the Prefecture administration.&#13;
1.16 Land Re-Management Committee. The Land Re-Management Committee&#13;
(LRMC) was established in March 1994 under Prime Ministerial Decree No. 42/PM to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
provide policy direction and implementation assistance across institutions at all levels.&#13;
The eleven person committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and Chairperson of&#13;
CPC supported by the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture. These are all ex-officio&#13;
members. Additional representation consists of Vice Ministers of Industry and the&#13;
Ministry of Interior. The Director of DOLHM acts as secretariat to the Committee and is&#13;
supported by an officer of the Vientiane Municipality The core technical support to the&#13;
LRMC is limited to that provided by the DOLHM and the municipality staff which, given&#13;
the number of ex-officio members, limits the effectiveness of the Land Re-Management&#13;
Committee in policy and strategy formulation and oversight of its implementation.&#13;
1.17  The mandate of the Committee is to oversee the implementation of Decree 99 on&#13;
land (issued December 19, 1992) and Decree 52 on document registration (issued March&#13;
13, 1993) and guide the preparation of land management policy and programs at national&#13;
and provincial level. These activities are directed through the DOLHM with direct&#13;
operational linkages to the provincial financial services. Each province is required to&#13;
establish a Land Re-Management Committee to oversee activities at that level.&#13;
1.18  The National Land Re-Management Committee is proposed to have an important&#13;
land management policy making function. The objectives of the Land Re-Management&#13;
Committee are to provide policy and program design guidance to DOLHM in the areas of&#13;
demarcation, registration and titling, adjudication and resolution of land disputes and the&#13;
compilation of a land administration data base.&#13;
1.19  Provincial Agencies. Administratively, the country is divided into 17 Provinces&#13;
plus one special region and further divided into 129 Districts (see Map). At the provincial&#13;
level the Division of Finance carries out the major functions relating to land management.&#13;
The Divisions of Finance have 7 offices with tax, lands and housing and state assets, the&#13;
three units involved in land management. The Financial Services Division mirrors the&#13;
functions of the national level MOF and is responsible for conducting field programs&#13;
such as registration and related activities and tax assessment and collection through the&#13;
offices of the district administration. Provincial and district agencies are implementing&#13;
arms of central government agencies which are responsible for providing policy and&#13;
technical guidance.&#13;
1.20 The Land and Housing Management Office (LHMO) is responsible for the&#13;
implementation of the DOLHM policies and programs specifically, operating the current&#13;
registration system and assessment of land taxation requirements. The LHMO has two&#13;
units: Land titling records and cadastral survey; and land tax.&#13;
1.21  The district level administration provides an important function in the formal&#13;
document registration and land tax collection system. The district office follows the&#13;
procedures defined in the formal procedures pertinent to the particular transaction and the&#13;
type of land classification. The formats and the process are controlled by the head of the&#13;
district LHMO. The district level land officer represents the provincial administration in&#13;
carrying out land registration activities including the preparation of the necessary plans&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
and documentation. The district officer provides the access to the service users and&#13;
village level and carries out programs designed by the provincial administration. The&#13;
district is responsible for the identification of 8 classifications of land based on&#13;
information from formal and informal transactions.&#13;
1.22  The district lands officer supported by the village headman (nai baan) provides the&#13;
documentation including tax certification and proof of ownership together with the&#13;
required witnesses and documentation to the provincial office which certifies and signs&#13;
the document to the land. The provincial level maintains the register although copies are&#13;
kept at the district level office. The district office plays an important role in the dispute&#13;
resolution process if it cannot be resolved at the village level, invariably with the&#13;
assistance of the village head man.&#13;
1.23  Other Agencies Involved in Land Management. Other agencies involved in land&#13;
management are the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and the Ministry of&#13;
Communications, Transport, Constructions and Posts (MCTCP). MAF is responsible for&#13;
agriculture and forest land use management. A major focus has been on land demarcation&#13;
between forests and agricultural land and attempting to develop incentives for&#13;
communities to manage land resources sustainably in exchange for community land use&#13;
rights to traditionally controlled village lands. The linkages to a formal land titling&#13;
program and the role of incentives (including possible provision of title) in improving&#13;
resource management in rural areas need to be addressed as a priority; a study to address&#13;
these will be supported under the proposed project (see para. 2.15 (c)). MCTCP, through&#13;
the Department of Housing and Town Planning, has a mandate to facilitate the urban&#13;
planning and development activities at provincial level.&#13;
1.24 Also having a key role in a titling program is the National Geographic Department&#13;
(NGD). The Department has the responsibility for carrying out mapping within the&#13;
country and is administered separately from DOLHM, coming under the auspices of the&#13;
Prime Minister's Office. In addition, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) is responsible for the&#13;
drafting of laws and decrees and will play a role in the further development of land laws.&#13;
E. LESSONS FROM PREvIous IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.25  IDA has had no experience with land administration projects in Lao PDR.&#13;
However, it has supported and is currently supporting projects in the agricultural and&#13;
natural resources sector. A review of project performance in Project Completion Reports&#13;
and in Operations Evaluation Department's (OED's) Project Audits has rated all past&#13;
projects as unsatisfactory. Implementation has generally been constrained by&#13;
inappropriate macro and sectoral policies, weak institutions, and a poor human resource&#13;
and infrastructure base.&#13;
1.26 The World Bank's experience with supporting land titling projects world-wide&#13;
has been mixed, with success recorded primarily in the Thailand projects, but with less&#13;
success recorded in most of the other projects. According to the review of these projects&#13;
by the World Bank's Environment Division in a report entitled The World Bank's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
Experience with Rural Land Titling (report no. 1992-35, March 1992), the factors which&#13;
contributed to poor performance of land projects include: (i) lack of political support; (ii)&#13;
conflicting bureaucratic priorities and/or infighting; (iii) lack of institutional capacity or&#13;
unwillingness to commit adequate resources; and (iv) underestimation of complexity&#13;
and/or costs, or other design weaknesses. On the other hand, the factors responsible for&#13;
success in the Thailand land titling projects include: (i) simple project design, with only&#13;
one single objective of land titling and one single agency responsible for project&#13;
implementation; (ii) strong government commitment to the project; (iii) a graduated&#13;
increase in cost recovery; (iv) specially formed and trained systematic adjudication teams&#13;
which involved the communities concerned; and (iv) use of efficient new technologies.&#13;
1.27 The key lessons drawn from Bank experience with land titling projects would&#13;
point to the following factors to enhance project success. EirL, projects should be&#13;
designed simply, with minimal objectives and a single implementing agency, with clear&#13;
and well functioning management links at provincial or regional level. Second, projects&#13;
should be designed on the basis of the borrower's existing human skills and institutional&#13;
arrangements, augmented by training and technical assistance, and appropriate staff&#13;
incentives. Third, projects should focus on existing land rights, and not on addressing&#13;
reallocation of existing rights, and should be consistent with the Government's own plans&#13;
to address land use questions.&#13;
1.28  The above lessons have been used in project design in the following ways. Eirt,&#13;
a simple project design has been followed, with the project objectives limited to land&#13;
titling and valuation and with one lead agency responsible for project implementation.&#13;
Second, in order to overcome human resource problems and lack of experience in project&#13;
implementation, the project has been preceded by grant funding in support of pre-&#13;
implementation activities including a land titling pilot, project management training,&#13;
development of a legal and policy framework, and technical assistance. In addition, a lot&#13;
of emphasis is given to use of private contracting (domestic and international) to&#13;
overcome human resource constraints in project management and implementation, though&#13;
ensuring continuous cooperation with the public sector, working with local government&#13;
officials, and training of counterparts to ensure sustainability. Third, the project is&#13;
focused on registration of existing rights, and does not attempt to address land reform&#13;
issues.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1   The Country Assistance Strategy for Lao PDR (dated January 18, 1996, and&#13;
discussed by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors on February 22, 1996) lists poverty&#13;
alleviation and the improvement of the standard of living for the Lao people as its main&#13;
objectives. Economic growth, which is a necessary condition for poverty alleviation,&#13;
requires that the appropriate economic infrastructure and enabling environment for&#13;
private investment be in place. The lack of land markets poses a problem for domestic&#13;
and foreign investors. The country assistance strategy highlights the importance of&#13;
alleviating the present uncertainties associated with the lack of clear titles and recording&#13;
of land transactions in order to create an enabling environment for economic growth.&#13;
2.2        IDA involvement in the project has been guided by two principles: (i)&#13;
comparative advantage; and (ii) partnership with Government and other donors. The&#13;
Bank has considerable experience in supporting land titling projects (see paras. 1.25-1.28)&#13;
and is therefore well positioned to support the proposed project. Furthermore, the Bank&#13;
has, in partnership with AusAID, supported successful land titling projects in Thailand&#13;
and Indonesia, and this partnership, in the form of co-financing, will continue in the&#13;
proposed project. The project itself has evolved out of the dialogue between the&#13;
Government and donors in the framework of supporting the country's transition from a&#13;
centrally planned to a market economy. Support for the development of efficient land&#13;
markets is included as a priority activity in the country's Public Investment Program to&#13;
the Year 2000.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.3   The overall goal of the project is to strengthen the basis for long term sustainable&#13;
economic and social development. In conformity with this goal, the objectives of the&#13;
project are to foster the development of efficient land markets and to facilitate domestic&#13;
resource mobilization by providing a system of clear and enforceable land use ownership&#13;
rights, and by developing a land valuation capacity.&#13;
2.4   The project would support the first seven years of a longer term national land&#13;
titling program (which would be developed during implementation) aimed at extending&#13;
secure land ownership and developing land administration and valuation systems,&#13;
including compiling a cadastral mapping system. The main components of the project&#13;
are:&#13;
(a)   completion of the policy and legal framework for land management and&#13;
administration (US$0.4 million);&#13;
(b)   implementation of an accelerated land titling program (US$19.9 million&#13;
including US$4.0 million for base mapping, US$15.2 million for&#13;
systematic registration and US$0.7 million for sporadic registration);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
(c)   improvements in the infrastructure, facilities and systems for land&#13;
administration (US$2.7 million);&#13;
(d)   improvements in land valuation (US$0.8 million);&#13;
(e)   support for project management and implementation, and institutional&#13;
strengthening (US$4.0 million); and&#13;
(f)   studies on community land tenure and registration, definition of forest&#13;
boundaries, cost recovery, land rights issues on nationalized lands and&#13;
socio-economic impact of land titling (US$0.6 million).&#13;
2.5   The systematic titling program would be undertaken in Vientiane Prefecture and&#13;
in the urban and peri-urban areas of the four provinces of Luang Prabang, Vientiane,&#13;
Savannakhet and Champassak. The Prefecture and the four provinces were selected to&#13;
provide a wide range of locations throughout the country. Other criteria for selection&#13;
were: (i) potential high economic and population growth; (ii) high rate of payment of&#13;
land tax; and (iii) minimum forest areas.&#13;
2.6   Districts within the provinces were selected based on the same criteria as for the&#13;
selection of the provinces. For the first phase of the Project, districts which contain major&#13;
urban areas would be undertaken, followed by adjacent districts.&#13;
2.7   The sporadic titling program, which involves issuance of titles on a demand basis,&#13;
would be started initially in three provinces where there is potential high demand.&#13;
Specific provinces to be covered by sporadic titling would be selected annually by the&#13;
Project Steering Committee as part of the approval process for the annual work plan and&#13;
budget.&#13;
C. DETAILED PROJECT FEATURES&#13;
Completion of a Policy and Legal Framework for Land Management and Administration&#13;
2.8    This sub-component would support the current activities of the MOF and&#13;
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) in applying existing regulations and preparing future land&#13;
legislation to improve the legal basis for land management and administration by&#13;
providing an overall policy framework within which such laws may be developed. Land&#13;
management and administration policy would be reviewed and action taken to address&#13;
deficiencies and inconsistencies starting with the areas to be studied as listed in paragraph&#13;
2.4 (f) above. Laws and regulations would be developed, continuing from the work&#13;
commenced under the Pilot Project initiated in 1994, to: (i) address the legal constraints&#13;
to the titling program; (ii) ensure secure legal status of land titles; and (iii) support the on-&#13;
going registration of transactions.&#13;
2.9   The first pilot project resulted in the issuance of titles for only 300 parcels out of a&#13;
target number of about 2,900 parcels (about 10 percent registration rate). The results of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
the pilot highlighted some problems which have influenced the design of the proposed&#13;
project and prompted the Government to seek support for operational trials ahead of the&#13;
main project. The key problem was the ineligibility of parcels for registration either&#13;
because the landholders had no documents (50 percent) or had unregistered documents&#13;
(30 percent). In addition, some landholders who had unpaid land taxes and transfer taxes&#13;
were reluctant to participate in land registration, fearing they would be required to pay&#13;
outstanding taxes.&#13;
2.10  To achieve registration rates of successful land titling programs (e.g., the Thailand&#13;
Land Titling Project achieved a 79 percent registration rate), the Government has decided&#13;
to use more realistic standards of evidence of land possession (including consideration of&#13;
non-documentary evidence) and to introduce an option to issue provisional/qualified titles&#13;
with a provision for their automatic maturation into full land use rights after a specified&#13;
number of years (about three) if no successful challenge has been made against the titles.&#13;
2.11   A Ministerial Instruction (MD 990) on new procedures for land registration was&#13;
issued on September 27, 1995. To reflect the above policy considerations, the Instruction&#13;
includes provisions for: (i) the empowerment of systematic adjudication teams; (ii) the&#13;
regulation of the issuance of titles; (iii) issuance of provisional titles; and (iv) clarification&#13;
of institutional arrangements. The new procedures of land registration included in the&#13;
Ministerial Instruction were tested under the Second Pilot Land Titling Project which&#13;
commenced during July 1995 and was completed in February 1996. Under the Pilot a&#13;
systematic adjudication approach was successfully introduced and used to register 80&#13;
percent of the targeted 1,200 parcels, including state land. During negotiations.&#13;
assurances were obtained that the Governent would not later than September 30. 1996&#13;
submit to IDA for p   aroval the proposed time-bound action plan for implementing&#13;
the lessons learned and recommendatiions derived from the Pro.ject Preparation operation&#13;
trials undertaken prior to credit effectiveness. Once approved by IDA. the Government&#13;
would immediately undertake all necessary measures to implement the recommendations&#13;
duly taking into account IDA's comments. The Govemnment would issue not later than&#13;
January 31. 1997, Implementing Regulations to the land-related decrees satisfactory to&#13;
IDA, incorporating the lessons learned from the operational trials. The Regulations&#13;
would set forth the procedures for the issuance  registration, adjudication. and&#13;
enforceability of land transfer, occupancy and use rights. Already, there is a Government&#13;
Committee which has started drafting a Land Law that will be furnished to IDA for&#13;
review as soon as a draft is ready. If the Land Law supersedes the decrees, regulations to&#13;
the Land Law will be prepared under the project..&#13;
Implementation of an Accelerated Land Titling Program&#13;
2.12  A major objective of the project is to support the Government's initiatives in&#13;
accelerating the issuance of land titles and building up DOLHM's capacity in land&#13;
registration and administration. This would be assisted through: (i) the production of&#13;
base maps; (ii) the development and conduct of a systematic adjudication and registration&#13;
program of land parcels in five jurisdictions; and (iii) support in selected provinces for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
improvements in the on-going sporadic adjudication and registration activities. In the&#13;
first two years, the emphasis would be on building and improving the institutional,&#13;
technical, human resource and regulatory foundation of systematic adjudication and&#13;
registration. Support for sporadic adjudication and registration would include staff&#13;
training, regulatory and procedural improvements and provision of equipment, vehicles&#13;
and development funds for land registration. This component would include the&#13;
following five sub-components:&#13;
(a)   Base Mapping. This would support production of maps using a photo&#13;
base, including map control, aerial photography, and photogrammetric&#13;
mapping. Funds would be provided for NGD's building&#13;
extension/renovation, training, mapping equipment and map production.&#13;
For the first three years of the project, most of the base mapping would be&#13;
contracted out while NGD's capacity is being strengthened. Upon its&#13;
evaluation, NGD would then be considered to undertake a significant&#13;
proportion of the mapping thereafter if it can do it efficiently. Aerial&#13;
photography would be undertaken to cover a total surface area of about&#13;
465,000 ha, with about 2,300 rectified and enlarged mapsheets made for&#13;
the project. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that all&#13;
required security clearances, approvals, licenses, permits and permissions&#13;
would be provided promptly for undertaking aerial photography and. it&#13;
necessary. for processing outside the territorv of Lao PDR of photogaphic&#13;
negatives produced as a result of aerial photographic activities. In&#13;
addition: assurances were also obtained that MOF and NGD would enter&#13;
into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) providing for the transfer of&#13;
project funds to NGD before disbursement can be made to support aerial&#13;
photography and the production of maps under NGD. A draft MOU was&#13;
reviewed during negotiations.&#13;
(b)   Systematic Adjudication and Registration. This would involve: (i)&#13;
development, testing and refinement of new systematic adjudication and&#13;
registration procedures; (ii) field work for systematic registration in&#13;
project areas; (iii) preparation of records and certificates and their&#13;
distribution to land holders; and (iv) filing of the records in the Provincial&#13;
land offices. The project would provide assistance for the development of&#13;
a legal and institutional framework for registration , and meeting the costs&#13;
of vehicles, equipment, field work and registration of documents in the&#13;
provincial offices. The build up of a large number of permanent staff to&#13;
carry out this work is not feasible or sustainable, because of current civil&#13;
service hiring restrictions, and as this first time registration work is a one&#13;
time activity. Therefore, a combination of public and private sector&#13;
approaches and the use of temporary employees have been incorporated&#13;
into the project design. Based on limited staff in the project provinces and&#13;
staff available in other agencies including NGD, MAF and MCTPC who&#13;
can be seconded to the project and the contracting of personnel from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
private and public sectors, about 19 adjudication teams (350 staff) would&#13;
be mobilized to survey and adjudicate about 300,000 parcels over seven&#13;
years. They would undertake work in Vientiane Prefecture and Province,&#13;
and in the provinces of Savannakhet, Champassak and Luang Prabang.&#13;
(c)   Sporadic Adjudication. At least three selected provinces not included in&#13;
the systematic registration component would receive support to imnprove&#13;
their existing sporadic first time registration procedures and facilities.&#13;
Sporadic adjudication and registration would include a review of&#13;
procedures, their improvement and their implementation. In addition,&#13;
each provincial land office would be provided with a vehicle, survey and&#13;
office equipment, and development funds to better carry out sporadic&#13;
registration. A total of about 22,900 parcels would be surveyed and&#13;
adjudicated under this sub-project.&#13;
(d)   Training in Support of Systematic and Sporadic Adjudication. Training&#13;
would be provided: to NGD staff on the use of GPS; on management of&#13;
systematic and sporadic registration processes for provincial land offices;&#13;
and on systematic registration process to surveyors, registration parties&#13;
and land offices, including the training of trainers in systematic&#13;
registration, community relations and services, and briefing sessions for&#13;
local government officials. For the non-systematic provinces, the training&#13;
would be in sporadic registration and customer relations and services only.&#13;
(e)   Customer Relations and Services (CRS). This sub-component would&#13;
support the implementation of the systematic adjudication and registration&#13;
activities by ensuring that landholders and other people involved in the&#13;
project have the necessary information to effectively participate in the land&#13;
titling program. This would be achieved through town, village, and door&#13;
step meetings, radio and newspaper advertisements and announcements,&#13;
training in CRS for the systematic adjudication teams and briefings for&#13;
local government officials. Funds would be provided for training, staff&#13;
development, transport, and equipment.&#13;
Land Administration&#13;
2.13  The land titling program will place new and additional pressures on the Vientiane&#13;
Prefecture and the four provincial and district offices in project provinces in terms of&#13;
increasing volumes of land transactions and records. The project would support the long-&#13;
term development of land administration systems to improve efficiency and service&#13;
delivery, ensure the security of land records and sustain the land titling program after&#13;
project completion. It would support: (i) reviews of systems and procedures; (ii)&#13;
improvement of records management systems and security, including the development of&#13;
a computerized land registration system in selected provinces and development of a land&#13;
records management policy which would include consideration for safety of land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
documents and timely access to the documents for use in land transactions and land&#13;
management and administration; (iii) improvement in provincial land office facilities,&#13;
including new provincial land offices and provision of secure office storage, equipment&#13;
and materials; (iv) training land office staff; and (v) development and implementation of&#13;
customer relations services. Similar support would also be provided for sporadic&#13;
registration activities in other selected provinces.&#13;
Land Valuation&#13;
2.14  The project would assist the MOF in increasing its revenue collection from land&#13;
registration services, state land management including leasing and, in the medium term,&#13;
from land taxes, through the development of improved and more equitable systems of&#13;
valuation. A major focus of the component would be human resource and skills&#13;
development, especially by the establishment of a valuation course in a Lao institution.&#13;
Use would also be made of the Bangkok Institute of Technology's valuation course for&#13;
both education and training. Another component would establish a sales and rental&#13;
valuation data base, initially for Vientiane Municipality and subsequently for other major&#13;
urban areas, followed by development of valuation systems, preparation of manuals for&#13;
valuation staff development and training. In addition, support would be given to the&#13;
development of a land valuation policy and legislation. International and national&#13;
valuation specialists would be supported under the Project to work with the staff of MOF.&#13;
Project Implementation and Capacity Building&#13;
2.15  The project would strengthen DOLHM's capacity in project planning,&#13;
management, and monitoring and evaluation of the land titling program. It would support&#13;
the following sub-components:&#13;
(a)   Project Management. It would strengthen the PSU in DOLHM which&#13;
would be established prior to project effectiveness. It would provide&#13;
vehicles, office equipment and training of staff and funds for project&#13;
management, procurement, disbursement and support in project planning,&#13;
budgeting, coordinating, monitoring and evaluation, and the preparation of&#13;
progress reports. In addition, funds would also be provided for contracting&#13;
the Project Administrator (PA), whose responsibilities would be to assist&#13;
the Project Director and Manager in the management of the project,&#13;
including procurement, contract supervision, implementation planning and&#13;
monitoring, and financial management (see para. 3.7 for details on the&#13;
responsibilities of PA).&#13;
(b)   General Strengthening of the Institutions. This would aim to strengthen&#13;
the organizational capabilities of DOLHM and of the project provinces to&#13;
effectively implement the Government's land titling program. An&#13;
important input would be the undertaking and implementation of a human&#13;
resources development strategy and operation and management studies&#13;
which would guide DOLHM to achieve the most effective and efficient&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
use of its human resources and to build an organizational and management&#13;
structure that can support a modem land titling and administration system.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government&#13;
would, by November 30. 1996, prepare and submit to IDA for its prior&#13;
approval the terms of reference of the socio-economic baseline survey and&#13;
impact study, the community land tenure study, the forest boundary&#13;
definition study. the land fees and cost recovery study, the study on&#13;
efficiency and land rights issues of nationalized land. the human resource&#13;
development study and the organizational management and operation&#13;
study and a time-based plan for undertaking them. Upon receipt of IDA's&#13;
approval, the Government would promptly carry out each study and&#13;
submit to IDA for review and comments the draft report of each study&#13;
together with the proposed work plan and related budget for implementing&#13;
its recommendations. Once approved by IDA, the Government would&#13;
immediately take all measures necessarv to implement the&#13;
recommendations with due diligence and efficiency.&#13;
(c)   Long-Term Development of Land Administration. This would support a&#13;
number of studies that would investigate issues relating to land&#13;
administration, the results of which will assist the GOL and DOLHM in&#13;
the formulation of procedures to sustain the development of a long term&#13;
land administration system. There are five studies. First, a community&#13;
land tenure study would be initiated during the first year of the project to&#13;
investigate and recommend appropriate registration procedures for areas&#13;
with community land tenure arrangements. Second, a land fees and cost-&#13;
recovery study would be initiated during the second year of the project to&#13;
review the fees being charged for land titling and transfer in order to&#13;
generate options for recovering the costs of land registration. Third, a&#13;
forest boundary definition study would be initiated during the second year&#13;
of the project to investigate and recommend appropriate procedures of&#13;
delineating and registering land adjacent to forests. Fourth, a socio-&#13;
economic baseline survey would be initiated during the first year of the&#13;
project and a follow-up survey initiated during the final year of the project&#13;
to measure the socio-economic impact of land titling. And a fifth study&#13;
would deal with efficiency and land right issues on nationalized lands; this&#13;
would be initiated during the second year of the project. The draft terms&#13;
of reference for these studies can be found in Annex 8. During&#13;
negotiations. assurances were obtained that: the Government would, by&#13;
November 30, 1996, submit to IDA for review and comments the terms&#13;
reference of these studies and a time-based plan for undertaking them.&#13;
Upon completion, the draft Reports of each study and a plan to implement&#13;
the recommendations of each study would be furnished to IDA for review&#13;
and comments before the recommendations are implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(d)   Education and Training. This sub-component would aim at raising the&#13;
skill levels of the staff of DOLHM, DSA, NGD, Vientiane Prefecture and&#13;
provincial land offices. Project support would include in-country training&#13;
on project management, IDA's procurement procedures, and basic&#13;
computer and English courses.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Overseas Training&#13;
2.16  Technical Assistance. Detailed technical assistance arrangements are presented in&#13;
Annex 6. The technical expertise would be involved in the introduction and&#13;
implementation of base mapping and systematic adjudication and registration, land&#13;
administration and land valuation. The responsibilities of technical assistance would&#13;
include technology transfer to counterparts, and support of the actual implementation.&#13;
Project administration training would be undertaken by the staff of the PA (see Annex 7).&#13;
2.17 The TA has been designed in such a manner that minimal additional&#13;
administrative demands would be placed on DOLHM to support the program itself.&#13;
Sufficient resources have been budgeted to support the mobilization, management,&#13;
coordination and support of the various technical assistance activities. The TA&#13;
encompasses 216 man-months of intemational expertise and 296 man-months of&#13;
expertise to be obtained locally.&#13;
2.18  Overseas Education. Training. Work Experience, and Stdy Tours. The overall&#13;
plan for overseas education and training is contained in Annex 6 (Table 2). The project&#13;
would support investments in the staff development necessary to ensure the successful&#13;
implementation and sustainability of this land titling program. Because of staff&#13;
shortages, the need for counterpart staff, and the presence of most of the intemational&#13;
specialists in the first two years of the project, most of the short term training and&#13;
scholarships have been designed to occur in the last two years of the project. Overseas&#13;
scholarships include 226 person-months, plus 107 person-months of short term training&#13;
and study tours. Long-term overseas education includes undergraduate and diploma&#13;
courses in surveying, digital mapping, valuation, land administration, land information&#13;
systems, valuation, and public administration. Staff selected for the education and&#13;
training courses would be from DOLHM, DSA, Vientiane Prefecture, the provincial&#13;
offices, and NGD. Training for project management would be included in the PA sub-&#13;
component.&#13;
2.19  The short-term training includes formal courses and a series of two month's work&#13;
experience training in international organizations with comparable responsibilities in a&#13;
range of technical areas. A series of group study tours have also been planned, where&#13;
groups of personnel would travel to international agencies to study selected land&#13;
administration matters and review current initiatives for improved efficiency in land&#13;
administration. During negotiations. assurances were obtained that the Government&#13;
would provide to IDA for prior approval by August 31 of each year beginning August 31.&#13;
1996 a proposed training program and budget for the central government and provincial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
staff involved in the project; once approved by IDA. the Government would immediately&#13;
take all measures to implement the program taking into account IDA's comments.&#13;
D. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
project Costs&#13;
2.20  The total project costs are estimated at US$28.38 million, including taxes and&#13;
duties (US$1.15 million), and physical and price contingencies (US$3.68 million). The&#13;
foreign exchange component is estimated to be million (60 percent). A large proportion&#13;
of the total project costs (over 45 percent) relate to investments in the legal and policy&#13;
framework, institutional and physical infrastructure and in capacity building that would&#13;
support a longer term program of land titling and administration that goes beyond the&#13;
project's time frame; therefore only about 55 percent of the costs relate directly to the&#13;
immediate production of land titles.&#13;
2.21  Project costs are summarized in Tables 2.1(a) and (b), and further details are&#13;
provided in Annex 1. Project costs include about US$28.07 million (99 percent) in&#13;
investment and development costs and US$0.31 million (1 percent) in recurrent costs.&#13;
Project costs include costs defined as capital costs in economic terms, including those&#13;
costs involved in creating an asset in the form of a new property cadastre, which is&#13;
expected to produce a stream of benefits over a number of years, and development costs&#13;
needed to develop the land titles. The recurrent costs include salaries and allowances,&#13;
operation and maintenance of vehicles and equipment, office operating costs related to&#13;
the strengthening of DOLHM's service delivery and capacities in project planning and&#13;
&#13;

development of computerized land registration and studies. Project base costs are&#13;
calculated in constant 1995 prices. Physical contingencies of 10 percent have been&#13;
included for civil works and aerial photography. Except for technical assistance, overseas&#13;
training, PA and studies, price contingencies of US$3.53 million, equal to about 14&#13;
percent of base costs, have been included to accommodate annual projected domestic&#13;
inflation rates of 10 percent in 1996 and 6.5 percent thereafter, and 2.6 percent per year&#13;
for international inflation. Cost estimates for the technical assistance and overseas&#13;
training components to be funded by AusAID are based on current rates of Australian and&#13;
national consultants and overseas training courses.&#13;

2.23 The proposed IDA Credit of US$20.73 million would finance 76 percent of&#13;
project financing requirements, exclusive of taxes (Table 2.2). The Credit would include&#13;
US$12.39 million (73 percent) of the foreign exchange requirements and US$8.34&#13;
million of local costs. It would finance civil works, equipment, vehicles, furniture, aerial&#13;
photography, map production, development costs of land titling, computerized land&#13;
registration, PA, local training, studies and recurrent costs on a declining basis. AusAID&#13;
would contribute US$5.06 million (19 percent of total project costs, net of taxes) which&#13;
would cover 100 percent of foreign exchange costs for technical assistance and overseas&#13;
training, and would be financed on a parallel basis. The Government would provide the&#13;
balance of US$1.44 million, 5 percent of total project costs exclusive of duties and taxes&#13;
(US$1.15 million). Project financing arrangements are summarized below. The&#13;
Government would provide adequate annual budgetary allocations to DOLHM, the&#13;
project provinces, Vientiane Prefecture, NGD and DSA to meet the counterpart funding&#13;
requirements for the project. During negotiations. assurances were obtained that&#13;
AusAID's Memorandum of Subsidiary Arrangement (which governs AusAID's funding)&#13;
would become effective before the IDA credit may be declared effective.&#13;

E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
Procurement Framework&#13;
2.24 Procurement would be handled by DOLHM. Given the lack of experience by&#13;
DOLHM  in handling international and local procurement and the hiring of consultancy&#13;
services, and its institutional limitations including having only eleven active staff&#13;
members, the Government has agreed in principle that a Project Administrator (PA)&#13;
would be contracted during the initial years to carry out the procurement and&#13;
administration of the contracts under the Project, including coordination and&#13;
administration of services provided by relevant Government Departments.&#13;
2.25    Project Administrator (PA). The services of a consulting firm will be engaged to&#13;
act as a project administrator. In addition to filling the project administration void and&#13;
providing badly needed institutional strengthening, the services of the PA would allow&#13;
DOLHM to focus on policy issues as well as on the implementation of the administration&#13;
and valuation activities. The PA consultancy would have three major components; (a)&#13;
procurement; (b) financial control and project monitoring; and (c) formal training of&#13;
DOLHIM and other government staff related to project administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
2.26  The procurement function would cover all tasks involved in the procurement&#13;
processes of the project, from the preparation of advertising notices and invitations to bid&#13;
through evaluation of contracts (except awarding and signing of contracts unless&#13;
delegated to do so) which are to be financed with IDA or GOL funds. These include: 12&#13;
ICBs for works, goods, service and consultancy contracts, of which one has&#13;
prequalification; 5 International Shoppings; 10 NCBs; and 6 Local Shoppings. Technical&#13;
specifications would be prepared by the technical experts whose services would be&#13;
included in the AusAID financing package for TA.&#13;
2.27  The project administration function will cover, as a minimum, the following&#13;
tasks: contract administration; project planning, budgeting and monitoring;&#13;
measurements, certifications and payments to suppliers, contractors and consultants;&#13;
handling of project accounts and statement of expenses; withdrawals from the IDA credit;&#13;
management training for government counterpart staff; and production of reports.&#13;
2.28  The formal training function comprises seminars to DOLHM and other GOL staff&#13;
on: (a) international and national procurement; (b) contract administration and&#13;
monitoring; (c) planning and budgeting; (d) receiving, storing and delivering; (e)&#13;
financial control; (f) processing disbursement and withdrawal requests; (g) processing&#13;
claims; (h) managing project accounts and statements of expenses; and (i) reporting.&#13;
2.29  As the PA's services would be financed by the IDA credit, the selection and&#13;
hiring process would be in accordance with the IDA/World Bank's Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants, and the letters of invitation, TORs and draft contract would require&#13;
IDA's prior clearance. The procurement function and formal seminars, having&#13;
measurable outputs in terms of procurement processes undertaken and completed and of&#13;
seminars delivered, respectively, will be paid on the basis of these outputs. On the other&#13;
hand, the project administration function, including on-the job training of counterpart&#13;
staff, will be paid on the basis of inputs, i.e., actual time and material expended. In view&#13;
of the above, technical and price aspects will be taken into account in the evaluation of&#13;
offers, with corresponding weighting which will depend on the measurability of the&#13;
outputs.&#13;
2.30  Acting for and on behalf of the Project Director of DOLHM, the PA would&#13;
initially take over the administration function of the project, which will include all tasks&#13;
related to the procurement of goods, works, service contracts and consulting services&#13;
which are to be financed with IDA and/or GOL funds (except for contract award and&#13;
signing and excluding the contracts which are to be financed with AusAID funds), project&#13;
planning and monitoring, as well as all physical and financial aspects of contract and&#13;
project administration.&#13;
2.31   The duration of the PA consultancy initially will be two years after which some of&#13;
its functions may be extended, as needed, on a year-to-year or month-to-month basis. It&#13;
is envisioned that the PA's work will taper off as GOL staff are trained, in such a manner&#13;
that after the first two years, only advisory services will be required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
2.32  The PA will be expected to assign at least one resident expert for each of the&#13;
following fields: procurement, financial control; and project/engineering management.&#13;
DOLHM will assign one senior and one junior staff of the Project Support Unit (PSU) to&#13;
work with each PA resident expert in all day-to-day activities. Transfer of skills being a&#13;
key element of the PA consultancy and as a result of the formal and on-the-job training to&#13;
be provided, it is envisioned that after the first year, each PA expert will assume the role&#13;
of supervisor and relinquish his/her functions to the local counterpart and, finally, that&#13;
towards the end of the second year, the experts will become advisors to the PSU staff.&#13;
During negotiations. assurances were obtained that the PA would be hired not later than&#13;
September 30. 1996. A draft letter of invitation. TORs and a contract for PA were&#13;
reviewed during negotiations.&#13;
2.33  Bidding Documents and Contract Documents. Neither ICB nor NCB documents&#13;
are available in DOLHM for review as the Department has no project implementation&#13;
experience. Given the mandatory use of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for ICB&#13;
and the fact that, except for the aerial photography contract and civil works, few bidding&#13;
activities would take place in the first year of implementation, preparation of bidding&#13;
documents does not appear to be a constraint to timely project implementation.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
2.34  Civil Works. Contracts for civil works in Vientiane City and Vientiane Province,&#13;
for the construction of two new buildings and the renovation and extension of the NGD&#13;
building, valued at (US$0.45 million), would be procured through ICB with&#13;
prequalification of bidders, utilizing the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs).&#13;
Qualified domestic contractors participating in the ICB would be eligible for a margin of&#13;
preference of 7.5 percent in the evaluation of bids. In view of the small value&#13;
(US$ 137,000 each) and of their being located in remote areas, a condition which will&#13;
likely attract only local contractors and not even national ones, civil works contracts for&#13;
the construction of two new buildings and the renovation of an existing building in the&#13;
other provinces estimated to cost US$410,000 in aggregate, would be procured through&#13;
NCB procedures acceptable to IDA..&#13;
2.35  Goods. Contracts for vehicles and scientific equipment, valued at a total of&#13;
US$2.77 million, would be procured through ICB procedures in accordance with IDA&#13;
Guidelines. Domestic manufacturers participating in ICB would be eligible for a margin&#13;
of preference of 15 percent or the rate of import duties, whichever is less in accordance&#13;
with IDA Guidelines. Boundary markers and furniture (US$0.37 million) and minor&#13;
equipment (US$0.2 million), all of which are available in the local market and estimated&#13;
to cost US$290,000 or less per contract, would be purchased through NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Materials for mapping and land titling (US$0.13 million), which will&#13;
be spread out over the five year implementation period of the project and estimated to&#13;
cost US$50,000 or less per contract, would be procured through International Shopping,&#13;
obtaining at least three prices from qualified suppliers in accordance with IDA&#13;
Guidelines. Minor contracts for goods and supplies with an estimated value of US$&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
25,000 or less and an aggregate value not to exceed US$0.18 million, may be procured&#13;
through the UN Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office (for urgently needed&#13;
supplies), direct contracting with IDA's prior agreement or on the basis of national&#13;
shopping, as described above.&#13;
2.36   Service Contracts for Aerial Photography, map production and Computerized&#13;
Land Registration Management System, valued at a total of US$5.02 million, would be&#13;
procured through ICB, in accordance with IDA Guidelines.&#13;
2.37 Consultancies and Training. Consulting services totaling 216 staff-months of&#13;
international and 296 staff-months of national expertise, and overseas education and&#13;
training totaling 333 staff-months, all estimated to cost US$5.06 million, would be&#13;
funded in parallel by AusAID and procured according to its own procedures. Five studies&#13;
totaling 28 staff-months (US$0.55 million) and the PA (US$2.0 million) would be&#13;
procured on the basis of IDA Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.&#13;
2.38   Miscellaneous. For the balance of US$11.24 million, which includes systematic&#13;
and sporadic adjudication, local training and recurrent costs, procurement is inapplicable&#13;
since implementation will be by force account.&#13;
IDA Prior Review&#13;
2.39  For all contracts with a value of US$200,000 equivalent or more per contract for&#13;
civil works, goods and service contracts (aerial photography, map production and&#13;
computerized land records) each set of bid documents would be subject to prior review by&#13;
IDA before issuing to bidders, and evaluation reports would be reviewed by IDA before&#13;
award of the contract. This would cover about 65 percent of the value of works and 80&#13;
percent for goods contracts and 100 percent of the value of the service contracts. All&#13;
other contracts of goods would be subject to IDA post review procedures. All&#13;
consultancy contracts with firms valued at the equivalent of US$100,000 equivalent or&#13;
more will be subject to IDA prior review procedures; so would contracts with individuals&#13;
valued at the equivalent of US$50,000 or more. Prior review procedures would apply&#13;
regardless of the value of contracts with respect to draft letters of invitation and contracts,&#13;
terms of reference, sole source selection, qualification criteria, evaluation reports, award&#13;
proposals and final contracts when substantial differences to the original draft are made.&#13;
For individual consultants, simplified review procedures would apply as per IDA&#13;
Guidelines. All post review contracts for civil works, goods and consultants would be&#13;
subject to sample review. In order to ensure timely award of contracts, the PSU should&#13;
ensure all required information is provided to IDA promptly, and evaluation and contract&#13;
award proposals are also submitted to IDA in a timely manner.&#13;

F. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
2.40 The proposed IDA credit of SDR 14.0 million (US$20.7 million equivalent)&#13;
would finance about 76 percent of the total project costs, net of taxes and duties.&#13;
Disbursements would be as follows:&#13;
(a)   95 percent of expenditures for civil works;&#13;
(b)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent of local expenditures&#13;
for aerial photography;&#13;
(c)   100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local expenditure (ex-&#13;
factory cost) and 80 percent of local expenditures for locally procured&#13;
vehicles, furniture, materials and equipment;&#13;
(d)   100 percent of expenditures for system development (computerized land&#13;
records), PA and studies;&#13;
(e)   90 percent of expenditures for the development costs of mapping and&#13;
titling and local training; and;&#13;
(f)   on a declining basis for recurrent expenditures: 100 percent up to&#13;
September 30, 1999 and 50 percent thereafter.&#13;
2.41 MOF and NGD would enter into a Memorandum of Understanding as a condition&#13;
of disbursement of funds for aerial photography and map production (see para. 2.12 (a)).&#13;
Full documentation would be required for disbursements against all contracts for civil&#13;
works, goods, and service contracts (aerial photography, contract land titling, and&#13;
computerized land registration) above US$200,000, consulting firms above US$100,000&#13;
and individual contracts above US$50,000. Disbursements for all other items below&#13;
these levels, including training, would be made against SOEs prepared by the PSU.&#13;
Documentation supporting the SOEs would be retained by the executing units and made&#13;
available for review by IDA supervision missions. The project would be physically&#13;
completed by March 31, 2003, and Credit closing would be on September 30, 2003.&#13;
Disbursements will therefore be completed in seven and a half years as opposed to eight&#13;
years which is the average for all IDA projects in Lao PDR. An estimated schedule of&#13;
disbursements is presented in Annex 2.&#13;
2.42  Special Accounts. In order to facilitate timely payments of project expenditures, a&#13;
Special Account would be established in a bank acceptable to IDA and on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA. The account would be established in US currency with an&#13;
authorized allocation of US$600,000 equivalent. The account would be replenished&#13;
monthly or when it is drawn down by 30 percent of the initial deposit, whichever occurs&#13;
first. Sub-accounts would be established to enable the channeling of funds to support&#13;
field activities in the project provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
G. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
2.43  Under the project, DOLHM would maintain separate project accounts covering all&#13;
financial transactions for project activities and would prepare annual statements of&#13;
receipts and expenditures based on the project accounts. DOLHM would also maintain&#13;
the accounting and internal control systems for disbursements by IDA against statement&#13;
of expenditures. During negotiations. assurances were obtained that the Government&#13;
would ensure that separate records and accounts would be maintained for the project.&#13;
including the Special Account. and would be audited each fiscal year by an independent&#13;
auditor acceptable to IDA; the audit would include a separate opinion on the use of the&#13;
SOEs well as the status of audit compliance; a detailed audit report would be submitted&#13;
to IDA within six months of the closing of the Government's fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
3. ORGANIZATION&#13;
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.1   The project would be implemented by DOLHM of the Ministry of Finance except&#13;
for the production base maps which would be carried out by NGD. The Director of&#13;
DOLHM will operate as the Project Director, supported by a Project Support Unit (PSU).&#13;
The Project Director would contract the services of a Project Administrator (PA) who&#13;
would assist in managing the project during its initial years. At the Provincial level, the&#13;
project would be implemented through the Land and Housing Management Offices, in&#13;
the Division of Finance. A detailed description of the functions of PSU, PA and other&#13;
units involved in project management and coordination can be found in Annex 11.&#13;
Documentation of these organizational arrangements and a staffing plan were reviewed at&#13;
negotiations and found satisfactory by IDA.&#13;
3.2   Project Steering Committee. An overall Project Steering Committee (PSC) will&#13;
be formed under the chairmanship of the Vice Minister of Finance. Its members will&#13;
include representatives at the level of chief of cabinet of the Ministries of Finance,&#13;
Justice, Communication, Transport, Posts and Construction, and Agriculture and&#13;
Forestry; representatives of the Prime Minister's Office, the Prefecture of Vientiane, and&#13;
the project provinces; and the Project Director. DOLHM would serve as the Secretariat&#13;
of the PSC. The Steering Committee would be responsible for overall project supervision&#13;
and coordination, including the approval of annual workplans and budgets, and the&#13;
review of semi-annual progress reports. It would also act as a link to the Land Re-&#13;
management Committee for advice on policy decisions impacting the implementation of&#13;
the project. In each province, there would be a Provincial Oversight Committee (POC)&#13;
chaired by the Vice-Governor in charge of development and including representatives&#13;
from relevant provincial agencies (including Agricultural and Forestry Services, the Lao&#13;
Women's Union and the MCTPC Service at the province) to coordinate project&#13;
implementation in the provinces. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the&#13;
Government would establish and thereafter maintain until completion of the project. with&#13;
membership and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA: (1) by September 1. 1996, a&#13;
Project Steering Committee: and (2) by October 15. 1996. a Project Oversight Committee&#13;
in each province within the Project Area.&#13;
3.3   Responsibilities of the Project Director. The position of the Project Director&#13;
would be ex-officio filled by the Director of DOLHM. The Project Director would have&#13;
overall responsibility for ensuring that the project achieves its stated objectives. He/she&#13;
would provide overall direction for the project and manage the co-ordination of the PSC,&#13;
Land Re-management Committee, IDA and AusAID.&#13;
3.4   Responsibilities of the Project Manager. The Project Manager would be a full-&#13;
time position, reporting to the Project Director, and would be directly responsible for&#13;
project management. Responsibilities would include: the submission of work plans,&#13;
budgets and progress reports, through the Project Director, to the PSC and funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
agencies; and the management of the PSU. The Project Manager would act on behalf of&#13;
the Project Director in project matters during the absence of the Director. He/she would&#13;
be assisted by the Team Leader of the Technical Assistance to coordinate TA activities.&#13;
The Project Manager will rely on the PA for management support and training during the&#13;
initial years of the project.&#13;
3.5    Responsibilities of the Project Support Unit. The PSU would be established in&#13;
DOLHM to support the Project Director in his various responsibilities, including: (i)&#13;
monitoring of project implementation including the preparation of progress reports; (ii)&#13;
planning of project implementation including preparation of workplans and budgets; (iii)&#13;
financial management and control including verification of payment requests by&#13;
contractors, submission of withdrawal applications, compilation of project accounts and&#13;
arrangements for their auditing; (iv) coordination with concerned agencies for the&#13;
implementation and supervision of the project: and (v) acting as the Secretariat to the&#13;
PSC. The PSU would consist of at least nine full time national professional staff&#13;
responsible for procurement, disbursement. monitoring, planning, accounting and&#13;
financial controls. Support staff and additional technical experts would be hired as&#13;
needed to cover specific project activities. During negotiations. assurances were obtained&#13;
that the Government would establish and maintain a PSU prior to project effectiveness.&#13;
under the Project Director. and staff it with at least a qualified project manager. a&#13;
procurement officer and a project accountant. before the credit is effective.&#13;
3.6    Technical Assistance. The national staff of the PSU would be complemented by&#13;
technical consultants who would provide technical expertise and training to the national&#13;
staff and serve as resource persons to address project-related policy and technical issues&#13;
(see paras. 2.16-2.19).&#13;
3.7   Project Administrator. Given the lack of experience of DOLHM to manage&#13;
donor-funded projects, a PA would be hired to assist DOLHM in managing the project&#13;
during the initial years while also providing it with the necessary training to fully take-&#13;
over the management functions. Overall, the functions of the PA will be to set up&#13;
management systems for the PSU; initially handle management in selected areas on&#13;
behalf of the Project Director and Project Manager; and, actively transfer the relevant&#13;
skills and technologies to PSU staff in such a manner that subsequently, the PSU can&#13;
fully assume responsibility for project management. Specifically, the PA will perform&#13;
the following functions: procurement; project accounting and financial control; project&#13;
management including planning, monitoring and reporting; and capacity building and&#13;
training of PSU. A detailed description of the functions of PA can be found in Annex 11;&#13;
arrangements for the hiring of PA and its terms of reference are contained in paras. 2.25 -&#13;
2.32 and in Annex 7.&#13;
3.8    Responsibilities of the Provincial Project Facilitation Unit (PP FU. A PPFU&#13;
would be established in each project province, in the office of the provincial lands and&#13;
housing chief; it would be staffed with two local professionals plus support staff. It&#13;
would be directed by the head of the Land Housing Office of the province. The PPFU&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
would co-ordinate and facilitate project implementation at the provincial level. It will&#13;
have the following functions: (i) serve as a Secretariat to the Provincial Oversight&#13;
Committee (POC), including preparation of the annual work plans and budgets for POC&#13;
endorsement before they are forwarded to the Project Director; (ii) coordinate and liaise&#13;
with the central, provincial, district and village officials, in project implementation; (iii)&#13;
plan, monitor and evaluate project activities in the province; and (iv) maintain project&#13;
accounts and verify expenditures at the provincial level. During negotiations assurances&#13;
were obtained that the Government would establish bv October 15. 1996 and thereafter&#13;
maintain until completion of the project. with membership and terns of reference&#13;
satisfactory to IDA: a Provincial Project Facilitation Unit in Vientiane Province and each&#13;
province within the Project Area.&#13;
B. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
3.9   The PSU would be responsible for the preparation of progress reports and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of project implementation. Semi-annual reports would be&#13;
prepared using the key performance indicators identified for the project as the basis for&#13;
assessing the progress of project implementation; an indicative list of the key&#13;
performance indicators is contained in Annex 5. These reports would detail the progress&#13;
of the project, identify possible problems or impediments and detail specific&#13;
recommendations for remedial action, if necessary, and would be presented to the PSC&#13;
and to the Bank. The reports would be submitted within two months of the end of the six&#13;
month period being reported upon. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the&#13;
Government would throueh the PSU: (a) submit to IDA by May 31 and November 30 in&#13;
each fiscal year. beginning on November 30. 1996. a semi-annual progress report on the&#13;
implementation of the Project: (b) organize and caary out joint annual project review&#13;
meetings with representatives of the Government and IDA and prepare an annual&#13;
progress report on the implementation of the project. under terms of reference satisfactory&#13;
to IDA to be reviewed at these meetings: (c) as part of each annual review. prepare and&#13;
carri out a follow-up time based action plan satisfactory to IDA to remedy any&#13;
deficiencies in project implementation identified during such review.&#13;
3.10 In addition, a mid-term review of the project would be jointly undertaken by the&#13;
Government and IDA by December 31, 1999. It would focus on: (i) progress made in&#13;
implementing the various components of the project; (ii) progress in overcoming&#13;
implementation problems particularly those related to project management and the hiring,&#13;
training and supervision of personnel to undertake systematic Land adjudication and&#13;
registration; (ii) the requirements by the Government to develop a long term national land&#13;
titling program; and (iv) redesigning the project if necessary. Furthermore, the&#13;
Government would contribute to the preparation of an Implementation Completion&#13;
Report within six months of the Credit Closing. During negotiations. assurances were&#13;
obtained that the Government would carry out not later than December 31. 1999. based&#13;
on TORs acceptable to IDA. a comprehensive midterm review of the project and of the&#13;
implementation of the national land titling program. Based on the findings of the mid-&#13;
term review, the Government would undertake all necessary actions to achieve the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
objectives of the project and further develop its national land titling program. Within six&#13;
months after the closing date. the Government would furnish a plan for the future&#13;
operation of the proiect and contribute to the preparation of an Implementation&#13;
Completion Report.&#13;
3.11   Key Performance Indicators. Project progress would be tracked against key&#13;
performance indicators and targets which would be refined annually and would be of two&#13;
broad types: straight forward project output indicators, and efficiency and financial&#13;
indicators though introduced at a later stage (see Annex 5). Output indicators include:&#13;
base maps produced; parcels identified, surveyed and titles issued; gender distribution of&#13;
beneficiaries; offices built; staff trained; scholarships and studies completed. Efficiency&#13;
indicators are those related to land office operation improvements, including: registration&#13;
costs relative to staff numbers, days taken to register sales and mortgage transactions; and&#13;
transactions completed against staff numbers. These would be introduced as DOLHM's&#13;
systems and staff become able to handle these concepts. A third type of indicators would&#13;
measure the impact of the project by assessment and data collection during the socio-&#13;
economic impact studies on at least a semi-annual basis. These include costs per title;&#13;
government real estate taxes generated; credit obtained using land titles as collateral;&#13;
value changes of registered land in areas covered by the project; and changes in the use of&#13;
agricultural inputs.&#13;
3.12  Bank Supervision. The Bank would conduct supervision missions at six-monthly&#13;
intervals during the implementation of the project, with a mid-term review after project&#13;
year two to review the progress made (see Annex 10). Joint annual reviews of project&#13;
implementation would be conducted by the Government, IDA and AusAID, and action&#13;
plans developed to address implementation problems. These would be coordinated with&#13;
the semi-annual and annual reviews of the work plans, budgets, and project targets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
4. BENEFITS, COSTS AND RISKS&#13;
A. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES&#13;
4.1    The project is aimed at registering about 258,500 parcels (80 percent of the&#13;
targeted parcels) corresponding to an equal number of families (a total of about 1.3&#13;
million people out of a population of 4.5 million) in urban and peri-urban areas who&#13;
would benefit directly from the project. Low income land holders would benefit&#13;
particularly from the project; without the project, only the higher income land holders&#13;
tend to have their real estate titled and registered. Project benefits are derived from titles&#13;
and other "outputs" of the project (e.g., aerial photomaps and cadastral maps), the&#13;
improved systems of land valuation and land information which can be developed from&#13;
them, and a more accessible, efficient and timely land administration service to the&#13;
public. While they do not lend themselves to a conventional economic rate of return&#13;
analysis, some of these benefits have been quantified through socio-economic impact&#13;
studies done for land titling projects in other countries.&#13;
4.2    According to socio-economic impact studies of land titling projects particularly&#13;
for Thailand, direct benefits to beneficiaries would include: improved tenure security&#13;
against unfair land acquisition; the possibility to sell land rights at fair prices; the ability&#13;
to use land as collateral; and reduction in conflicts over land rights. Development of&#13;
efficient land markets would lead to broader economic benefits including: more efficient&#13;
and transparent land transactions; easier access to the desired type of land for commercial&#13;
investment; mobilization of investable resources through use of land as collateral; and&#13;
provision of incentives for longer term investment in land-based activities and land&#13;
improvement. Socio-economic impact surveys that were undertaken to measure the&#13;
impact of the First Thailand Land Titling Project (1985-1991) found that:&#13;
(a)   farmers having titles increased their borrowing from institutional credit&#13;
sources by 27 percent while borrowers providing land as collateral&#13;
received 75 - 123 percent more institutional credit than those without;&#13;
(b)   farmers with land titles (as compared to those without such documents)&#13;
used inputs (including labor, draft power and other farm inputs) more&#13;
intensively by 10-30 percent, their agricultural output value was higher by&#13;
8-27 percent, their rate of capital'formation was also higher by 28 - 67&#13;
percent, and the rate of land improvements was higher by 37 - 100 percent;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)   title-equivalent land was 75 - 192 percent more valuable than&#13;
undocumented land while the direct cost of providing full title were&#13;
equivalent to only 0.6 - 5.6 percent of the marketed value of untitled land.'&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
4.3    Development of land valuation capacity would improve: (i) land tax&#13;
administration by enabling a more objective and realistic assessment of land values&#13;
(currently, land values are assessed through negotiation) and by making land taxes&#13;
responsive to changes in land values particularly in urban areas; (ii) compensation&#13;
mechanisms for land acquired by the state; administration of state enterprises and assets&#13;
leased to the private sector; and (iii) decision making by lending institutions in regard to&#13;
values of land offered for collateral.&#13;
4.4    The above benefits would be monitored and evaluated during project&#13;
implementation. The key project performance indicators that will be monitored include:&#13;
(i) changes in the use of improved agricultural inputs; (ii) use of land titles to acquire&#13;
institutional credit; (iii) values of registered land; and (iv) government revenue generated&#13;
(see para. 3.11). Funding has been included in the project to support the required socio-&#13;
economic studies and other monitoring and evaluation activities.&#13;
B. FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
4.5   It is expected that the project would result in increased government revenues. The&#13;
main sources for incremental Government revenues would be (i) transfer fees from a&#13;
larger number of transactions and based on higher land values; (ii) higher land tax&#13;
revenues as a result of better collection rates due to more accurate land records and a&#13;
more realistic assessment of land values; and (iii) income taxes on capital gains from land&#13;
value increases. Although the revenues from cadastral fees, payment for title certificate&#13;
and land tax can be estimated, it is at this stage difficult to quantify revenues from land&#13;
transactions with accuracy, but experience from other countries may serve as reference.&#13;
In Thailand, revenues from land-related taxes, including transfer fees and income tax, in&#13;
1994 amounted to about US$1 billion, an increase of over 500 percent in the ten year&#13;
period of 1984 to 1994 during which the Government issued over 4 million land titles to&#13;
landholders in rural areas, and adopted a more realistic valuation system for land taxation&#13;
purposes. Transfer fees accounted for about 55 percent of total revenues, followed by&#13;
income taxes (40 percent) and starnp duty (5 percent).&#13;
4.6    As a first effort to estimate the revenue potential to the GOL resulting from the&#13;
issuance of about 258,500 titles, a simple model has been developed based on the&#13;
following conservative assumptions:&#13;
(a)    production of 258,500 titles, including 242,000 titles generated under the&#13;
systematic and 16,500 titles under the sporadic titling program assuming a&#13;
titling rate of 80 percent of the total identified parcels of 323,100 titles);&#13;
(b)   cadastral fee and cost of title certificate of US$7.6 per parcel, based on the&#13;
cost of certificate of US$2.6/parcel and an average cadastral fee of&#13;
US$5/parcel. The average cadastral fee is estimated on the basis of a tax&#13;
regime of Kip 4,000 plus a fee of Kip 0.5/sq. m on an average parcel of&#13;
300 sq. m in urban areas, Kip 2,000 plus a fee of Kip 0.3/sq. m on an&#13;
average parcel of 1 ha in peri-urban areas and Kip 1,000 plus a fee of Kip&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
0.1/sq. m on an average parcel of 2 ha in rural areas, assuming relative&#13;
shares of 20 percent, 35 percent and 45 percent respectively for urban,&#13;
peri-urban, and rural parcels to be covered by the project;&#13;
(c)   an average land value of US$3,635 per parcel, based on the assumptions&#13;
that land parcels average US$10,000 in urban, US$3,000 in peri-urban and&#13;
US$1,300 in rural areas, weighted by their relative shares of 20 percent, 35&#13;
percent, and 45 percent respectively and that land values increase by 5&#13;
percent annually in nominal terms;&#13;
(d)   an average land tax rate of 0.12 percent of land value or U$4.2/average&#13;
parcel, based on the assumptions that average land tax for an urban parcel&#13;
is Kip 4/sq. m times 300 sq. m, for a peri-urban parcel Kip 6000/ha times&#13;
one ha, and for a rural parcel Kip 1000/ha times two ha, weighted by 20&#13;
percent, 35 percent and 45 percent, respectively;&#13;
(e)   a collection rate for land taxes which is 30 percent in year 1 (national&#13;
average) which has been assumed to rise to 75 percent in year 6 as a result&#13;
of institutional strengthening, more complete cadastral records, and&#13;
improved equipment and infrastructure provided under the project;&#13;
(f)    a land transfer fee of 2.5 percent on the parcel land value; and&#13;
(g)   a turnover of titled land parcels (transactions) at a rate of 2 percent per&#13;
year.&#13;
4.7   Based on the above assumptions, the results of the analysis are presented in&#13;
Annex 4 and summarized in Table 4.1 below.&#13;
Table 4.1: Projection of Incremental Revenues from Land-Related Taxes (US$ Million)&#13;
Year 5   Year 10   Year 15   Year 20&#13;
Incremental Annual Gross Revenues    1.06     1.54       1.96      2.5&#13;
Incremental Cumulative Gross         1.89     9.54      18.44     29.81&#13;
Revenues&#13;
Incremental Annual Net Revenues      0.71     1.38       1.14      1.71&#13;
Incremental Cumulative Net Revenues   0.70    7.10      11.85     19.21&#13;
4.8    Our conclusion from the analysis is that the Government would benefit&#13;
significantly from the project in terms of enjoying a strong positive net cash flow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
particularly after the tenth year of the project. This conclusion is drawn from an analysis&#13;
of incremental net fiscal revenues, which represent the difference between incremental&#13;
gross revenues resulting from the project and total project expenditures incurred by GOL.&#13;
The gross incremental revenues equal gross fiscal revenues from the parcels for which&#13;
titles would be issued, less the land taxes which would have been raised without the&#13;
project. The project expenditures incurred by the Government are the sum of interest&#13;
payments on the IDA credit (0.75 percent service charge on the outstanding balance),&#13;
repayment of principal (US$0.69 million per year over 30 years from project year 11 to&#13;
year 40) and GOL's project contributions (5 percent of total project costs). Incremental&#13;
annual net fiscal revenues amount to US$0.71 million in year 5 while cumulative&#13;
incremental net revenues total US$0.7 million after five years, and increase to over&#13;
US$7.1 million by year 10 and to US$19.2 million by year 20. The analysis shows that&#13;
the project would generate a positive incremental annual net cash flow of fiscal revenues&#13;
for the Government, except for the first two years.&#13;
4.9    Government revenues derived from the project have been conservatively&#13;
estimated, providing for potential additional revenues in case, for example, land values&#13;
increase faster and collection rates are higher than assumed. In the worst case scenario,&#13;
should for example land registration rates fall from the assumed 80 percent to 40 percent,&#13;
cumulative net cash flow-to Government would fall from US$19.2 million in year 20 to&#13;
about US$13.5 million; this would still represent a comfortable position for the&#13;
Government. As for the private beneficiaries, they would obtain project benefits which&#13;
would include: increased borrowing from institutional credit sources; increased use of&#13;
improved agricultural inputs; higher rates of capital formation; improvements in land; and&#13;
appreciating values of land. While these benefits cannot be quantified at this stage, they&#13;
would be expected to exceed by a multiple amount the revenue benefits expected to be&#13;
enjoyed by the Government (see paras. 4.1 and 4.2).&#13;
C. COST RECOVERY&#13;
4.10  The cost recovery analysis in this section is based on an analysis of payments to&#13;
the Government made by beneficiaries of land titles and the costs incurred by the project&#13;
in producing and delivering those titles. The payment for the cost of certificate and&#13;
cadastral fee, amounting to about US$7.6 per parcel, is direct cost recovery for the land&#13;
registration. This represents about 20 percent of the average unit cost of the land&#13;
registration (average of US$40/title). Moreover, cost recovery of land registration and&#13;
associated services provided by DOLHM is achieved not only through taxes charged for&#13;
first time land registration but also through taxation of subsequent land registration. With&#13;
these taxes, it has been demonstrated in paragraphs 4.8 and 4.9 that the Government&#13;
would realize a significantly positive cash flow from the project. This cash flow would&#13;
be available to support the operation and maintenance of the infrastructure and facilities&#13;
supported by the project. A review of cost recovery will be conducted in the second year&#13;
of the project (see para. 2.15(c)); the results of the review will be used as a basis to revise&#13;
cost recovery arrangements, if necessary, taking into account the need for full cost&#13;
recovery on one hand and minimizing disincentives to land registration on the other hand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
4.11  The impact of the project on the environment would be neutral in the short and&#13;
medium term. Experience in the Bank-supported Land Titling Projects in Thailand and&#13;
the Northeast Region Land Tenure Improvement Project in Brazil do not indicate any&#13;
significant impact on the environment. In the long term though, land registration could&#13;
have positive impacts on the environment in a number of respects. The long term land&#13;
titling program to be further defined under the Project, would provide incentives to invest&#13;
for long term land use (e.g., soil conservation in rural areas, and investments in&#13;
environmental infrastructure such as kitchens and bathrooms in urban areas) and provide&#13;
information, such as aerial photography and maps, which could be useful in&#13;
environmental management. In addition, the project would support studies on&#13;
community land use rights and recommend procedures for demarcation of forest&#13;
boundaries in project areas, in close coordination with the demarcation of protected forest&#13;
and conservation areas being undertaken under the IDA-funded Forest Management and&#13;
Conservation Project (Cr. 2856-LA).&#13;
E. SOCIAL IMPACT&#13;
4.12  The accelerated land titling and registration is expected to result in a reduction of&#13;
disputes over land rights in the project areas, representing a significant positive social&#13;
impact. Such an impact was observed in the Thailand Project and is documented in its&#13;
socioeconomic evaluation study.&#13;
4.13   Within Lao PDR, most farmers own or have traditional access to their farm lands.&#13;
Most rural and peri-urban families own their household land through customary&#13;
acknowledgment, rather than formal registration, while most urban dwellers also own&#13;
their own homes, with the incidence of registration being higher. A major objective of&#13;
the project is to legalize and register land rights of long term occupants and it is proposed&#13;
to reduce the emphasis on documentary evidence requirements to enable the occupants to&#13;
obtain titles. The impact of these measures would also be positive in the sense of&#13;
minimizing the potential for displacement of long term occupants.&#13;
4.14  It is known that communal tenure exists within the project areas. However, this&#13;
relates to sites regarded as communal lands for common use by villagers and such lands&#13;
would not be targeted for registration of title at this stage. Because of its urban focus the&#13;
project, at this stage, will not face other issues relating to communal land tenure existing&#13;
in outlying rural lowland and upland areas. These issues will be the subject of a special&#13;
study during this stage of the project in order to prepare for further stages of the titling&#13;
program (see Annex 8 for the terms of reference).&#13;
F. GENDER ISSUES&#13;
4.15  Women in the Lao PDR comprise 51 percent of the population and 53 percent of&#13;
the agricultural labor force. In comparison to women in other Asian countries, Lao&#13;
women enjoy good opportunities for access and control of land resources, both legally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
and customarily. Well over 50 percent of the women live in areas which have strong&#13;
matrifocal and matrilocal traditions including female land inheritance, while at the same&#13;
time the constitution and the laws of the country promote equality. Under these laws men&#13;
and women are equally entitled to hold property. The Family Law specifies that any&#13;
property acquired during marriage is regarded as joint property. Land owned by a woman&#13;
prior to her marriage remains her individual property, and is not included in the joint&#13;
property acquired during marriage. Registration of title should reflect such traditional&#13;
property rights and hence would not be detrimental to the interests of women but rather&#13;
strengthen their position.&#13;
4.16 However, concern has been expressed that the adjudication process could be&#13;
carried out in such a way that it does not fully recognize women's rights. This view is&#13;
based on the experience with the filling of land tax declaration forms, where the data&#13;
were sometimes collected in such a way as to infringe on the rights of women. This&#13;
occurred not through any fundamental desire to reform rights in land but was due to a&#13;
combination of poorly worded forms, a lack of awareness of gender issues by officials, a&#13;
high incidence of illiteracy and a lack of understanding by villagers of the requirements&#13;
and implications of the official processes. As the land tax declaration will be used as&#13;
strong proof of ownership in the land titling process, addressing this issue was made a&#13;
priority in the design of the project.&#13;
4.17   Consequently, the following preventive and corrective measures have been&#13;
incorporated in project design so as to preserve women's rights: (i) the Lao Women's&#13;
Union has been included as a member of the Project Oversight Committee at provincial&#13;
level; (ii) provision has been made for gender awareness training, firstly for staff of the&#13;
PSU and subsequently for all staff and members of the adjudication teams as part of their&#13;
systematic adjudication training; (iii) efforts would be made to ensure that as far as&#13;
possible, there is female representation in each adjudication team: the initial under&#13;
representation should be rectified over time when additional staff are being recruited and&#13;
more women have obtained training under the project; and (iv) provision has been made&#13;
to monitor gender statistics of land registration, together with other key perfornance&#13;
indicators, during project implementation.&#13;
G. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.18   Project sustainability would be enhanced by at least four actions. Eir, the project&#13;
would initially focus on areas with the highest current and potential demand for&#13;
registration of land transactions; a special study would be conducted under the project to&#13;
review the fee structure of land administration with regard to the affordability of land&#13;
transactions, the incentive to use formal rather than informnal registration procedures, and&#13;
the recovery of the full cost of land administration. Second, the project would support the&#13;
development of institutional and human resource capacity that would continue Project&#13;
operations after project completion; in particular, the project's support for land&#13;
administration would help build a capacity to manage title transfers on an on-going basis&#13;
once properties are registered in the land offices. Ihird, the public sector would manage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37 -&#13;
the issuing of titles and the project at least in its last four years, and would work with the&#13;
contractors at the local government and agency level in many of the project activities.&#13;
And furth, project preparation has involved a series of participatory and interactive&#13;
workshops with national, provincial and district participation of stakeholders in project&#13;
design with a view to fostering local ownership of the project which is critical for project&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
H. RISKS&#13;
4.19   There are two project risks: over-stretching DOLHM's implementation&#13;
capabilities; and inability to obtain high rates of land registration due to the ineligibility&#13;
of many landholders. The fi=t risk has been minimized through project design in at least&#13;
three ways: (i) adopting a simple project design and preceding the project with project&#13;
management training and technical assistance; (ii) contracting out project administration&#13;
in the first three years of the project; and (iii) providing for adequate capacity building&#13;
support under the project. The second risk has been addressed by proposed new&#13;
procedures of land registration to overcome issues that have held down land registration&#13;
rates (see para. 2.9); these would be tested as part of the pre-implementation activities&#13;
before being incorporated into the main project. The project would start small, with a&#13;
gradual build-up, and is flexibly designed to incorporate lessons from implementation&#13;
experiences. Initially, the project would operate in areas of strong economic activity, and&#13;
hence with the largest potential for generating demand for land titling and economic&#13;
benefits. While the project risks cannot be entirely eliminated, the potential benefits from&#13;
the project make it worth taking the risks.&#13;

(f)   the Govermment would carry out, not later than December 31, 1999, based&#13;
on TORs acceptable to IDA, a comprehensive midterm review of the&#13;
project and of the implementation of the national land titling program.&#13;
Based on the findings of the mid-term review, the Government would&#13;
undertake all necessary actions to achieve the objectives of the project and&#13;
further develop its national land titling program. Within six months after&#13;
the closing date, the Government would furnish a plan for the future&#13;
operation of the project and contribute to the preparation of an&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (para. 3.10);&#13;
(g)   the Government would ensure that all required security clearances,&#13;
approvals, licenses, permits and permissions are promptly provided for&#13;
undertaking the aerial photography and, if necessary, for processing&#13;
outside the territory of Lao PDR (para. 2.12 (a)) of photographic negatives&#13;
produced as a result of such aerial photography activities;&#13;
(h)   the Government would ensure that the PA is hired not later than&#13;
September 30, 1996 (para. 2.32);&#13;
(i)   the Government would not later than September 30, 1996 submit to IDA&#13;
for prior approval the proposed time-bound action plan for implementing&#13;

approved by IDA, the Government would immediately undertake all&#13;
necessary measures to implement the recommendations duly taking into&#13;
account IDA's comments. The Government would issue not later than&#13;
January 31, 1997, Implementing Regulations to the land-related decrees&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, incorporating the lessons learned from the operational&#13;
trials. The Regulations would set forth the procedures for the issuance,&#13;
registration, adjudication, and enforceability of land transfer, occupancy&#13;
and use rights (para. 2.11); and&#13;
(j)   the Government would establish and thereafter maintain until completion&#13;
of the project, with membership and terms of reference satisfactory to&#13;
IDA: (1) by September 1, 1996, a Project Steering Committee; (2) by&#13;
October 15, 1996, a Project Oversight Committee in each province within&#13;
the Project Area; and (3) by October 15, 1996 a Provincial Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

LAO PDR&#13;
LAND TITLING PROJECT&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
PROJECT ADMINISTRATOR&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (referred to in this&#13;
document as "Lao PDR", "Laos' or "GOL") is undertaking a Land Titling Project for the&#13;
Prefecture of Vientiane and the province of Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Savannakhet and&#13;
Champassak. The project will be implemented by the Department , of Lands and Housing&#13;
Management (DOLHM) which is a dependency of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).&#13;
2.    The project, estimated to cost US$28.4 million, would support the first seven years&#13;
of a longer term national land titling program aimed at extending secure land ownership and&#13;
developing land administration and valuation systems including compiling a cadastral&#13;
mapping system. The main components of the project are:&#13;
(a)   strengthening of the policy and legal framework for land administration and&#13;
management;&#13;
(b)   implementation  of an accelerated  land titling program  including base&#13;
mapping, systematic registration and sporadic registration;&#13;
(c)   improvements  in the  infrastructure,  facilities  and  systems for land&#13;
administration;&#13;
(d)   improvements in land valuation;&#13;
(e)   support for project management and implementation, and institutional&#13;
strengthening; and&#13;
(f)   studies on community land tenure and registration, definition of forest&#13;
boundaries, cost recovery, efficiency and land rights issues on nationalized&#13;
lands and socioeconomic impact of land titling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 7&#13;
Page 2&#13;
3.    The Government of Lao PDR has applied for a credit from the International&#13;
Development Agency (IDA). Once the credit is approved, the proceeds will be utilized for&#13;
various expenditures of the project including the hiring of a consulting firm to provide&#13;
support to the project management, implementation and support as well as the institutional&#13;
strengthening of the implementation agency. DOLHM.&#13;
4.    In parallel, the Government of Lao PDR has requested a Technical Assistance grant&#13;
from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) for the technical&#13;
support in the area of land titling, mapping and related activities.&#13;
II. CONSULTAiNCY SERVICES REOUIRED&#13;
1.    The support mentioned in 1.2(e) above. is critical for the success of the project as the&#13;
implementation agency, DOLHM, has had very little experience in the area of project&#13;
manaeement and implementation techniques and has never carried out a project of this&#13;
magnitude. To this end, the project envisions the contracting of a consulting firm to act as&#13;
Project Administrator (PA) which will provide services including, but not limited to the&#13;
areas of:&#13;
(a)   procurement, contract administration &amp; monitoring;&#13;
(b)   disbursements and financial control; and&#13;
(c)   training DOLHM's Project Support Unit (PSU) staff.&#13;
2.    The magnitude of the project and of the work to be done can be understood from&#13;
the following information:&#13;
(a)   the total project cost is estimnated at approximately US$28.4 million which&#13;
includes a technical assistance provided by funds from AusAID for technical&#13;
work including designs and specifications and expert training in the field of&#13;
land titling, mapping, aerophotography, systematic adjudication, valuations,&#13;
etc. (US$5.1 million equivalent). The IDA credit will be for US$20.7 million&#13;
and the balance represents counterpart funding.&#13;
(b)    16 major procurement packages for a total estimated value of the equivalent&#13;
of approximately US$20 million shown in Annex 1;&#13;
(c)    bar graph of procurement stages shown in Annex 2; and&#13;
&#13;

2.    The consultancy contract with the PA will itemize the price of the services on the&#13;
basis of the above categories and establish the parameters to be used.&#13;
(a)    Procurement services should be based on an agreed procurement plan and&#13;
payment scales which will relate to completed procurement processes. The&#13;
attached list (Annex 1) which shows the major procurement packages will&#13;
serve as a guide for the elaboration of the PA's procurement plan.&#13;
(b)   The seminar should be priced on a lump sum or per seminar basis and paid&#13;
accordingly as each one is delivered.&#13;
(c)    All other items should be expressed on the basis of hornoraria and rates, travel&#13;
and related costs including overhead. The offer should show a total price&#13;
estimate based on the PA's preliminary plan of activities and corresponding&#13;
human resource assignation schedule, with a minor adjustable component&#13;
expressed in rates for consultant-days or consultant-weeks, to cover slippages&#13;
and delays in the implementation of the project.&#13;
(d)   Payments on all the above shall be made with a 10 percent advance, progress&#13;
billings and a 10% retention, as shown in the above table. The amortization&#13;
of the advance will start after 20% of the contract is paid and will be&#13;
completed when 80% of the contract value has been paid.&#13;
VI. REPORTS&#13;
1.    Initial Report and Plan of Activities. Not less than one month after initiating the&#13;
work, the PA will submit for consideration of the Project Director, through the PSU, an&#13;
initial report which will contain a draft plan of activities showing how it proposes to carry&#13;
out the objectives of the three year consultancy. Since the training of the PSU staff is of&#13;
particular interest, the plan of activities will show achievement targets of the technology&#13;
transfer to the PSU staff over the three year period which, to the extent possible, will be&#13;
expressed in measurable quantities.&#13;
2.    Periodic Reports. Every six months, i.e., to the extent possible, one month prior to&#13;
each IDA Supervision Mission, the PA will send to the Project Director a progress report&#13;
showing the overall progress and status the project, detailed by procurement package;&#13;
contract for works, goods or consultancy; financial position and disbursements by source of&#13;
fund and by contract; and the training of the PSU staff including the targets achieved and&#13;
to be achieved.&#13;

3.    Final Report. One month prior to the termination of the contract period, the PA will&#13;
submit a final report showing the same information required in the periodic reports as well&#13;
as whatsoever recommendations it may deem appropriate to make for the remainder of the&#13;
project period and for the sustainability of the work in DOLHM.&#13;
V. EVALUATION OF OFFERS&#13;
1.    The evaluation of offers will take into account the bases for the payments which are&#13;
shown in IV. 1 above. Technical aspects of each offer, covering the consulting furm's general&#13;
experience in the field of project management for similar projects, work methods and work&#13;
plan for each of the six functions shown in IV. 1 above, qualifications and competence of the&#13;
personnel proposed, will be the dominant factors for consideration.&#13;
2.    Price will be a minor consideration, although its significance will depend on the&#13;
complexity and measurability of the outputs of each category. For the procurement and&#13;
formal training aspects, price will have a relative weight of 40% whereas for the others, only&#13;
10%. The relative weighting is summarized below:&#13;

LAO PDR&#13;
LAND TITLING PROJECT&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE OF STUDIES&#13;
I. STUDY ON LAND ADMINISTRATION FEES AND COST RECOVERY&#13;
1.    Background. In the context of the proposed Land Titling Project, the&#13;
Government would develop a land administration and valuation system capable of&#13;
providing clear and enforceable land use rights which are the basis for developing efficient&#13;
land markets. This will require the re-examination of fees currently charged for land&#13;
registration and land transactions with regard to their impact on affordability, incentives,&#13;
and cost recovery.&#13;
2.    Objective of the Study. The objective of the study is to analyze all fees, taxes&#13;
and charges related to land administration and to recommend changes to the fee structure&#13;
to ensure the affordability of land transactions, strong incentives to use formal rather than&#13;
informal procedures, and the recovery of land administration costs.&#13;
3.    Tasks. In preparation of the study, the following tasks would be undertaken.&#13;
A. Review and Analysis&#13;
(a)   Document and analyze fees, taxes, charges, and any other financial&#13;
obligation related to land registration and land transactions (short 'land&#13;
fees'), including a description of the historic development of fee structures&#13;
and revenue levels.&#13;
(b)   Analyze the affordability of land registration and transactions, including a&#13;
comparison of land fees with income levels and land values.&#13;
(c)   Analyze the incentive impact of the level of land fees on the decision to&#13;
use informal rather than formal land registration and transaction&#13;
procedures, including a comparison costs and the possible risks of informal&#13;
and formal transactions in rural and urban areas as well as an analysis of the&#13;
impact of outstanding tax payments on the willingness to formally register&#13;
land.&#13;
(d)   Analyze the recovery of land administration costs through land fees,&#13;
including an analysis of past and present levels of expenditures and&#13;
revenues and of collection rates. Examine the impact of inadequate land&#13;
valuation methods on revenues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                                Annex 8&#13;
Page 2&#13;
(e)   Project and analyze the impact of land fees on the future development of&#13;
land markets, including acceleration of land titling, improvement of land&#13;
administration, changing values of land, and flow of investments in land&#13;
urban and rural land development.&#13;
B. Options and Recommendations&#13;
(a)     Formulate short term options (implementable in less than one year) for&#13;
adjusting land fees to facilitate the process of accelerated land titling.&#13;
Formulate medium term options for the adjustment of the land fee&#13;
stracture by taking into account the need for: (i) affordable fee levels to&#13;
make land registration and transactions accessible to all income groups;&#13;
(ii) attractive fee levels which do not deter from using formal land&#13;
transaction procedures and which encourage land registration under both&#13;
the systematic and sporadic land titling programs; (iii) recover all or part&#13;
of the land administration costs from fee revenues. Propose options for&#13;
simplification of the fee structure and their potential impact on reducing&#13;
administrative costs and increasing collection rates.&#13;
Implementation of the Study. DOLHM would be the responsible&#13;
Government agency to supervise the preparation of the study. DOLHM&#13;
would also ensure that there is close cooperation and exchange of&#13;
information between the consultants for this study and the adviser on&#13;
land valuation. Recommend a best set of options and propose an action&#13;
plan including a timeframe, a responsible division, and how these&#13;
measures would be guided and promoted for passage in govermnent.&#13;
(b)     The approximate duration of the study is 3 months.&#13;
II. STUDY ON COMMuNITY LAND TENURE&#13;
4.    The objective of this study is to develop options to formally register community&#13;
land use rights and where appropriate, associated individual land use rights; and this&#13;
should be done such that land rights holders do not lose by this modem government&#13;
process. This would then allow the Lao Land Titling Project or a future project to&#13;
support such arrangements if found necessary.&#13;
5.    The study would be undertaken by a consultant company (ideally a joint venture&#13;
between an international and national company) research institute, or university. The team&#13;
of professionals would be skilled in land tenure studies, land law, land economics, and&#13;
sociology. International and national consultants would be ne:essary. A small but&#13;
selected sample survey in areas of known occurrence of community tenure would be&#13;
included in the study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 3&#13;
6.    The team would:&#13;
(a)   Review appropriate literature and interview knowledgeable professionals in&#13;
this topic, and analyze:&#13;
(i)   the characteristics of the tenure used in villages for both individual&#13;
holdings and commurity holdings, in both rural and urban areas;&#13;
(ii)  the types of village tenure used in non-forest areas, and from this&#13;
map out the rough geographic locations where the various types are&#13;
used;&#13;
(iii)  review the administrative players and arrangements for the tenures&#13;
and the processes of sale, exchange, inheritance, lease, and&#13;
mortgage equivalent; and&#13;
(iv)  include a review of the community land study undertaken in the&#13;
context of the Laos PDR Forest Management and Conservation&#13;
Project looking for potential linkages; and review the gender and&#13;
cultural study funded by AusAID in 1996;&#13;
7.    In undertaking the above, analyze the gender, ethnic, and traditional dimensions of&#13;
community tenure.&#13;
8.    Assess the applicability of current laws, regulations, and procedures, and their&#13;
application to community lands and any constraints they imposed on the registration of&#13;
those lands; Also review applicable traditional land laws and conflicts with modern law.&#13;
9.    Assess the present demand or otherwise by land holders and by village heads for&#13;
formal land registration under various scenarios (e.g., new investment, expropriation) by&#13;
conducting representative surveys of selected representative village land holders and&#13;
village leaders including women and NGO's;&#13;
10.   Develop formal registration options or models that fit the requirements which&#13;
might include individual land use right holdings coupled with rights to other property held&#13;
in common with other villagers or the whole village, including exploring the applicability&#13;
of the condominium models and leasehold models among others; and explain the preferred&#13;
option in terms of legal requirements, simplicity, and operational costs, and training&#13;
demands for villagers and officials.&#13;
11.   Develop for various circumstances, administrative options for the formal&#13;
registration of lands including those controlled by provincial and district governments with&#13;
little or no village participation, to those conducted still by the community but with&#13;
provincial and district oversight; and recommend preferred options.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 4&#13;
12.   Develop various implementation options (if appropriate) that would allow village&#13;
community lands to be titled, if necessary under a future land titling project, and outline a&#13;
time based action plan for implementation.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
The study will be guided by a lead group of agencies including DOLHM, MAF, MOJ, and&#13;
the Lao Women's Union. They will be kept informed of progress and through regular&#13;
meetings seeking their guidance.&#13;
Im. FOREST BOUNDARIES DEFINITION STUDY&#13;
Background&#13;
Objective and Scope of Study&#13;
13.   The aim of this study is to investigate and recommend efficient procedures for:&#13;
(a)   delineating and demarcating of forest boundaries in project areas; and&#13;
(b)   registering land parcels adjacent to forests, to eligible holders.&#13;
14.   Options to Delineate and Demarcate Forest Boundaries. To do this, the study&#13;
team would undertake the following tasks:&#13;
(c)   working with DOLHM, and the MvIinistry of Agriculture and Forestry&#13;
(MAF) and building on the study undertaken under the Forest Management&#13;
and Conservation Project, investigate the existing laws and regulations, and&#13;
associated procedures for delimitation and demarcation of forest&#13;
boundaries;&#13;
(d)   in conjunction with DOLIHM, and MAF, identify policy, institutional, and&#13;
administrative issues that apply when forest boundaries are defined in the&#13;
field; indicating the role of each level of government, each agency; and the&#13;
people; identify by inquiry the constraints and the impact on land holders&#13;
adjacent to forests;&#13;
(e)   if necessary, design pilot projects, to be implemented by DOLHM  and&#13;
MAF, to further investigate the most favored options; and&#13;
(f)   prepare a detailed report setting out options, preferred options and&#13;
procedures which could enable the demarcation of forest boundaries.&#13;
15.   Rezistration of Land Adjacent to Forest Boundaries. Once the forest boundaries&#13;
are defined, it more likely to be able to grant titles to eligible land holders adjacent to the&#13;
forest. However, the study should:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 5&#13;
(g)   recommend options and procedures to guide granting full titles for eligible&#13;
land rights holders adjacent to forest land in a manner acceptable to all&#13;
parties, and with due regard to the environment (e.g., some restrictions&#13;
may be necessary, such as not granting title for land on slope exceeding 30&#13;
degrees);&#13;
(h)   with DOLHM, and MAF, investigate the Government policy towards those&#13;
who have encroached on forest lands, and propose options to improve the&#13;
situation in order to minimize the encroachment in the future; and&#13;
(i)   study the implications of forest occupation on land management policy in&#13;
the framework of any proposed new procedures.&#13;
Time Frame and Budget&#13;
16.   The study would be initiated no later than September 30, 1997, and completed by&#13;
the end of March 1998.&#13;
Skill Requirements&#13;
17.   The team required to undertake the study should be a mix of international and&#13;
national experts. International experts should have previous experience in Lao PDR. The&#13;
following skills maybe appropriate to undertake the study: forestry specialist, land tenure&#13;
specialist, survey and mapping specialist, and a Sociologist/Anthropologist.&#13;
IV. STUDY ON THE EFFICIENCY AND LAND RIGHTS ISSUES ON NATIONALIZED LANDS&#13;
Objective of the Study&#13;
18.   The objective of the study is to develop options for consideration by GOL PDR&#13;
and others to allow the people and GOL PDR to make more efficient and equitable use of&#13;
the land nationalized after the change in government in 1975. At present many lands are&#13;
held by third parties neither the former land holder nor the GOL PDR with varying&#13;
degrees of insecurity, resulting in under utilization of the land and a loss of production.&#13;
GOL PDR is interested in the generation of various options.&#13;
19.   A multi-discipline team of international and national specialists should undertake&#13;
the study including a land economist, a tenure expert, a land developer/entrepreneur/&#13;
urban planner, and a land law specialist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -Anex 8&#13;
Page 6&#13;
20.   Working with DSA and PSC, the team would:&#13;
(a)   provide the background to the situation in terms of history, past and&#13;
present polices, and trends, by a review of the literature and the conduct of&#13;
interviews with a broad range of informed people;&#13;
(b)   analyze the extent of the nationalization of these lands by undertaking&#13;
guided sample survey using questionnaires and interviews to allow an&#13;
analysis to categorize (undertaking surveys as necessary), the types of&#13;
situation land holdings, the types of land involved, the types of land&#13;
holdings and land holders involved, current land use, the timeframe of the&#13;
present situation involved; and the particular circumstance in major cities;&#13;
develop a classification system to assist in the analysis; isolate the key&#13;
issues that are acting as barriers to the productive use of these lands;&#13;
(c)    develop options to allow the various situations to be addressed. Options&#13;
may include: retention; renting; simple privatization; bidding potentially&#13;
valuable sites to the private sector requesting financial and technical&#13;
proposals for development of the site and bids to lease the land under GOL&#13;
defined conditions; development; etc.,&#13;
(d)   hold a workshop to review the draft report and present the most viable and&#13;
acceptable options. Derive an action plan and the next steps; and&#13;
(e)    prepare a final report presenting all the above information, preferred&#13;
options, and an action plan for implementation.&#13;
V. SOCIO-ECONOMIC INTACT STUDY&#13;
Objective of the Study&#13;
21.   The objective of the study would be to measure the project's social, economic,&#13;
fiscal and selected environmental impacts on the land holders in the areas the subject of the&#13;
project, and on the actual land. By so doing, the results of the study would confirm or&#13;
otherwise the benefits and impacts of land titling in Lao PDR circumstances and help&#13;
provide justification in the future for any continuation of the land titling program.&#13;
Background&#13;
22.   The study would build on the methodologies developed under the Thailand Land&#13;
Titling Project and that to be used in the Indonesian Land Administration project. The&#13;
Thai studies, however, relate to rural areas and agricultural circumstances; also such&#13;
studies and their results are often country specific. Therefore, as the Lao Land Titling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 7&#13;
Project is mostly aimed at urban and peri-urban lands and the recent history of Laos, this&#13;
study is considered essential.&#13;
MIethod and Implementation&#13;
23.   The baseline and follow-up study method would be used in at least two project&#13;
provinces, with two other provinces not in the project surveyed as control areas. The&#13;
baseline study would be undertaken in the second year of the project to provide a base&#13;
asainst which the project impacts would be assessed. The follow-up survey to measure&#13;
the impacts, would be undertaken in the last vear of the project or in 2002, which ever is&#13;
later. The study would be undertaken bv a consultant company, a research institute, or&#13;
university, ideally a joint venture of international and national professionals. The&#13;
disciplines of the team members should include economics, sociology/ anthropology,&#13;
financial analysis, and environmental science. The study would be guided by an inter-&#13;
ministerial team (a lead group) appointed by the Project Steering Committee, and with&#13;
the advice of the technical assistance team as appropriate.&#13;
24.   The terms of reference would be finalized by DOLHM with the support of the&#13;
technical assistance (TA) team under the guidance of the team leader of the TA.&#13;
Indicators Suggested for the Study&#13;
25.   The study team would isolate and derive applicable indicators of socio-economic&#13;
change attributable in part or wholly to land titling, and these over time would be assessed.&#13;
These include: land value changes to parcels; credit usage patterns and changes; input&#13;
use; improvements in productivity especiallv in the construction sector; investment trends&#13;
attributable to the project - e.g., more housing and environmental infrastructure&#13;
investment in urban areas, any urban to rural investment change; income impacts on land&#13;
holders and expenditures; investments in phvsical infrastructure attributable to the project&#13;
at the city, suburb and household levels, and any indicators of associated health&#13;
improvements; social impacts such as land dispute trends and rates; inheritance tradition&#13;
changes (very difficult to detect in the timeframe of the study); gender consequences;&#13;
ethnic consequences; and the overall social well being of land holders.&#13;
The Tasks&#13;
26.   The study team would undertake the following tasks: a baseline study including a&#13;
baseline report (including a consultative workshop); the follow-up study together with a&#13;
draft final report, followed by a seminar to present the results to interested parties;&#13;
evolution of an action plan in consultation with GOL; and the final report.&#13;
27.   The baseline study steps and tasks would include: formation of a lead group for&#13;
guidance and review purposes; design refinement; review of existing related international&#13;
socio-economic studies and isolation of possible project impacts; selection of&#13;
representative areas that may produce these impacts; formulation of questionnaires;&#13;
consultative workshop; training of the interviewers; testing of the questionnaire;&#13;
consultation of local government and village heads in the survey areas; conduct of the&#13;
survey; analysis of results; consultation with lead group of preliminary conclusions, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 8&#13;
baseline final report. A minimum of two areas would be surveyed, two to be titled in PY2&#13;
or PY3, with follow-up surveys not before the Year 2002.&#13;
28.   The follow-up study, would be conducted in the same areas as the baseline ideally&#13;
covering the same parcels and houses, managed by the same team of professionals and&#13;
undertaken by the same contractors. The steps would include: reformation of the lead&#13;
group; a preliminary survey of the original areas surveyed in the baseline study to ensure&#13;
expectations of titling and non-titling; review of the questionnaire; training of&#13;
interviewers; follow-up survey; analysis; reality check with knowledgeable people; draft&#13;
final report; in consultation with GOL the development of an action plan to achieve&#13;
changes arising from the study; a well publicized seminar to discuss findings, and the final&#13;
report. The report should be published and made available internationally to allow other&#13;
nations to benefit from this work.&#13;
29.   The study team would include in their reports an assessment of their findings for&#13;
land and social policy, government revenues, and the further implementation of the land&#13;
titling program.&#13;

LAND TITLING PROJECT&#13;
DRAFT ORGANIZATION PLAN AND FUNCTIOLNAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT STEERING&#13;
COMMITTEE (PSC), THE PROVINCIAL OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE (POC), THE PROJECT SUPPORT&#13;
UNIT (PS U), THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATOR (PA) AND THE PROVINCIAL PROJECT&#13;
FACILITATION UNIT (PPFU)&#13;
This annex describes the proposed functions, organization, and staffing of the-key&#13;
institutions involved in the project management, i.e. the PSC, POC, PSU, PA and PPFU.&#13;
A. PROJECT STEERING COMNIITTEE&#13;
Purpose. The proposed Land Titling Project is a project of the Government of Lao PDR&#13;
and forms part of a broader Government program to develop a market economy and to&#13;
foster the development of efficient land markets by providing a system of clear and&#13;
enforceable land use rights. The project needs to be closely linked and integrated into the&#13;
broader Government program and at the same time provide assistance to the policy makers&#13;
on land related issues. The inter-agency Project Steering Committee hence serves as an&#13;
instrument for the overall Government supervision of the project and for coordination of&#13;
Government policies affecting the implementation of the project.&#13;
Functions. The PSC will have the following functions:&#13;
(a)    Provide guidance to the Project Director for the overall direction of the project&#13;
and on policy decisions of the Government.&#13;
(b)    Review and approve the annual workplan, the annual budget and the progress&#13;
reports for the project.&#13;
(c)    Act as a liaison to the Land-Remanagement Committee and recommend to that&#13;
Committee changes in policies and regulations which affect the implementation&#13;
of the project.&#13;
(d)    Coordinate between Government agencies, including provincial governments,&#13;
to ensure adequate support for a smooth implementation of the project.&#13;
(e)    Use DOLHivl, and in particular its Project Support and Technical Assistance&#13;
Unit as Secretariat, to develop policy recommendations on critical issues of&#13;
land management.&#13;
Membership. The PSC will have the following members:&#13;
(a)    Vice Minister of Finance, Chairman;&#13;
&#13;

Project Support Unit and the Technical Assistance Unit will prepare the meetings.&#13;
B. PROVINCIAL OVERSIGHT COL'YV;IITTEE&#13;
Purpose. iMvany of the project activities will take place in the provinces and need to be&#13;
closely coordinated with the provincial and local governments and their aaencies and&#13;
organizations representing relevant interest groups in the province. The main purpose of the&#13;
Provincial Oversight Committee is hence to ensure such cooperation and to oversee project&#13;
activities in the respective province.&#13;
Funlctions. The POC would have the following functions:&#13;
(a)    Review and approve the annual provincial workplan, the annual budget and the&#13;
provincial progress reports; these documents will subsequently be submitted to&#13;
the Project .M4anager for project-wide consolidation and final approval by the&#13;
Project Steering Committee.&#13;
(b)    Coordinate between provincial government agencies to ensure adequate&#13;
support for a smooth implementation of the project.&#13;
(c)    Report through the Vice-Governor to the Project Steering Committee any&#13;
major issue which could substantially affect the successful implementation of&#13;
the project.&#13;
(d)    Use the Provincial Project Facilitation Unit under the Chief, Office of Land and&#13;

Services, with the help of Provincial Project Facilitation Unit and the Provincial Technical&#13;
Adviser will prepare the meetings.&#13;
C. PROJECT SUPPORT UNIT&#13;
Rationale. The implementation of the proposed Lao PDR Land Titling Project poses a&#13;
significant challenge for the Government, and in particular DOLHNI which has no previous&#13;
experience with the management of foreian funded development projects. Substantial&#13;
external support will be provided through Technical Assistance and a contracted Project&#13;
Administrator. The purpose -of the PSU, which is to be located in DOLHM and to be&#13;
staffed with national staff, is hence to strengthen the implementation capacity within&#13;
DOLHNI, initially by absorbing skills and know how transferred from the PA, eventually by&#13;
assuming full responsibility for the management of the project.&#13;
Fulnictionis. The PSU will have the followin, functions:&#13;
(a)    Project Administration, including the preparation and implementation of&#13;
operational plans and budgets, liaison and coordination of activities with other&#13;
agencies, particularly with provincial authorities, the provincial project&#13;
facilitation offices, and NGD.&#13;
(b)    Secretariat to the Project Steering Committee and to the Project Director,&#13;
including the preparation of the annual workplans and budgets, semi-annual&#13;
progress reports, and ad-hoc information which the PSC may require.&#13;
(c)    Planning, monitoring, and evaluation of project activities, including the&#13;
preparation of annual workplan and budgets for submission to the PSC,&#13;
incorporating plans submitted by the provinces; the monitoring of&#13;
implementation of approved plans and performance indicators and preparation&#13;
of semi-annual progress reports and other reports which may be required by&#13;
the GOL, IDA, and AusAID; and the evaluation of project implementation and&#13;
preparation of recommendations for possible remedial action.&#13;
(d)    Financial control of project accounts, including the preparation of&#13;
disbursement plan, management of project accounts and the Special Account,&#13;
submission of applications of withdrawal and replenishment from IDA,&#13;
verification of payments for project expenditures, and documentation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
Annex I I&#13;
Page 4&#13;
statement of expenditures; also including the financial management of GOL&#13;
counterpart funds.&#13;
(e)    Procurement of goods, services, and works, including an estimated US$5&#13;
under non-lCB procedures; procurement of an estimated US$16 million under&#13;
IDA international competitive bidding procedures (ICB) will be the primary&#13;
responsibility of the Project Administrator.&#13;
(f)    Administration of human resources, including the payroll for project funded&#13;
staff, management of the human resource development plan for the&#13;
recruitment, re-allocation and training of project staff. In addition,&#13;
administration of other project activities (e.g., studies, legal component) and&#13;
project facilities (e.g., vehicles, equipment).&#13;
Organizational Structure. The PSU will be headed by a Project Manager. The Project&#13;
Nlanager reports to the Project Director, who, ex-office, is the Director of the DOLHilM.&#13;
The PSU will have four functional areas: (a) Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, (b)&#13;
Accounting and Financial Controls, (c) Procurement, and (d) Administration. The&#13;
PSU will be located in DOLHIM to ensure an adequate integration of project activities into&#13;
DOLHLM's regular activities and to facilitate the transfer of skills from the PSU to DOLHMfv.&#13;
Staffing Plan. In addition to a Project Director (part-time), the PSU would be staffed with&#13;
one Project %Manager, 8 local professionals, including 2 in each functional area, and 5&#13;
support staff, including I clerk/typist per finctional area and I driver. The rationale for&#13;
hiring 2 local professionals in each functional area lies in the need to facilitate an effective&#13;
transfer of know how from the Project Administrator to the PSU, the need to provide&#13;
adequate back-up while local professional are tied up in training or field work and the risk of&#13;
losingz acquired skills for the PSU as a result of rotation. The Project NManager, a first group&#13;
of 4 professionals (one per functional area) and support staff would be hired in the first year.&#13;
As second batch of 4 professionals would be hired in the second year. A selected group of&#13;
professionals will obtain training during the pre-implementation pilot program.&#13;
Description of Key Personnel. The PSU staff positions would have the following&#13;
finctions:&#13;
(a)    Project Director. The position of the Project Director will be ex-officio filled&#13;
by the Director of DOLHM. Hence the position of the Project Director will be&#13;
part-time only. The Project Director has overall responsibility for ensuring that&#13;
the project achieves its stated objectives. The Director would provide overall&#13;
direction for the project, manage the coordination with the Project Steering&#13;
Committee, senior GOL officials, IDA and AusAID. When necessary, the&#13;
Project Director could seek advice directly from the Team leader for the&#13;
Technical Assistance team or from the Project Administrator.&#13;
(b)    Project Manager. The Project Manager is a full-time position, reports to the&#13;
Project Director and is directly responsible for project management and day-to-&#13;
day operations. Responsibilities include the submission of work plans, budgets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
Annex I I&#13;
Page 5&#13;
and progress reports through the Project Director to the PSC and the funding&#13;
agencies and management of the PSU staff. The Project Manager would act&#13;
on behalf of the Project Director in project matters during the absence of the&#13;
Director for training or field visits. The Team leader of the Technical&#13;
Assistance will closely coordinate with the Project Manager all TA activities&#13;
and provide assistance as required by the Project Mlanager. The Project&#13;
Manger will rely on the Project Administrator for management support and&#13;
training during the first project years.&#13;
(c)    Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation Officer; the Accounting and&#13;
Financial Control Officer; the Procurement Officer; and the&#13;
Administrative Officer are full time positions with responsibility for the&#13;
functions described above (para. 3).&#13;
Transfer of Know How Arrangements. There are three arrangements for transferring&#13;
managerial skills and know how to the PSU:&#13;
(a)   the AusAID funded pre-implementation Pilot Project includes a training&#13;
component to prepare managerial staff for the PSU;&#13;
(b)   the IDA funded Project Administrator will have responsibility for setting up&#13;
project management systems and transferring the necessary management skills&#13;
to the PSU staff. It will use on-the-job trainingT complemented with&#13;
workshops, seminars and short-term training courses;&#13;
(c)   the AusAID funded TA team will provide through national counterparts and&#13;
international experts training and skills in technical areas and management of&#13;
Human Resource Development.&#13;

D. PROJECT ADMINISTRATOR&#13;
Rationale. As mentioned above, the management of the proposed Lao PDR Land Titling&#13;
Project poses a significant challenge to DOLHLM which has no previous experience with&#13;
complex project administration. To complement DOLHMI's capacity, a Project Support&#13;
Unit will be set up in DOLH?M and will be staffed with national staff (see above).&#13;
However, the PSU in itself will need to develop management skills and set up management&#13;
systems. In the interest of a well organized project start and effective transfer of relevant&#13;
management capacity to the PSU, it is planned that the Project will contract a consulting firm&#13;
to act as Project Administrator (PA).&#13;
Functions. Overall, the function of the PA will be to set up management systems for the&#13;
PSU, initially handle project administration functions in selected areas on behalf of the&#13;
Project Director and Project Manager, actively transfer the relevant skills and technologies&#13;
to PSU staff, in such a manner that, subsequently, PSU can assume full responsibility for&#13;
project administration. Specifically, the PA would have the following functions:&#13;
(a)    Procurement. Carry out with full responsibility procurement functions on&#13;
behalf of the Project Manager, including (i) processing of procurement&#13;
following ICB and non-ICB procedures; (ii) contract administration, in close&#13;
collaboration with the consultant for technical supervision of contracts; and&#13;
(iii) training of PSU staff in the procurement procedures;&#13;
(b)    Project Accounting and Financial Controls.. Establish financial and&#13;
account manac,ement systems which conform to the needs of the Project, the&#13;
guidelines of IDA, and the regulations of the GOL; initially, operate the system&#13;
with full responsibility, while training PSU staff; subsequently, supervise PSU&#13;
staff operating the system, and eventuallv assume the role of an adviser&#13;
(c)    Project Administrationi, Including Planning, Moniitoring, and Reporting.&#13;
Establish project management, monitoring and reporting svstems which&#13;
respond to the needs of the Project; initially, operate -he system With full&#13;
responsibility, while training PSU staff; subsequently, supervise PSU staff&#13;
operating the system, and eventually assume the role of an adviser.&#13;
(d)    Capacity Building and Training of PSU. Transfer skills, technologies, and&#13;
managTement systems in all areas where PSU carries management&#13;
responsibilities; undertake this capacity building through on-the-job training,&#13;
formal training, and seminars.&#13;
Organization. The PA would report to the Project. The PA would closely coordinate its&#13;
activities with the Project Manager and the concerned PSU staff to ensure a maximum on-&#13;
the-job learning effect. The PA would maintain a permanent representation in the PSU&#13;
office, while the overall level of staffing may varv according to demand. The PA will also&#13;
cooperate with the Technical Assistance team which may provide technical advise in its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

areas of expertise. The PA will initially be hired for 2 years with the possibility for&#13;
extension.&#13;
Staffing. In their proposals, bidders would propose a staffing plan for the PA acceptable to&#13;
IDA and the GOL. However, the following staffing plan provides a guide of what may be&#13;
required:&#13;
(a)    Project Administrator(s) or Project Engineer(s). Typically a holder of a&#13;
professional degree in engineering or business administration, preferably at&#13;
graduate level or equivalent experience, with at least 10 years experience in the&#13;
management of projects which are financed by multilateral development&#13;
institutions and a working knowledge on the project management techniques&#13;
including PERT/CPA, scheduling, materials management, cost control, quality&#13;
assurance and Total Quality Management, contract negotiation, contract&#13;
administration and crash programs.&#13;
(b)    Procurement Specialist(s). Typically a holder of a professional degree in&#13;
engineering, law or business administration, preferably at graduate level or&#13;
equivalent experience, with at least 7 years experience in international&#13;
procurement practices including contract administration; and an extensive&#13;
experience with the World Bank's Procurement Guidelines, Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants of the World Bankl and its Standard Bidding Documents.&#13;
(c)    Disbursement and Financial Controller(s). Typically a professional in&#13;
accounting or business administration, preferably at graduate level, with at&#13;
least 5 years experience in the financial control of investment projects financed&#13;
by a multilateral development bank.&#13;
(d)    Expediter(s) and other specialized support staff.&#13;
E. PROVINCIAL PROJECT F.ACILITATION UNIT&#13;
Rationale. The Land Titling Project supports a national program and hence the primary&#13;
mana-ement of the project lies with DOLHI1M and its Project Support Unit. However, the&#13;
many of the project activities take place in the provinces and need to be closely coordinated&#13;
with the provincial and local government and their agencies responsible for land&#13;
mana-ement. Furthermore, strengthening of the provincial land administration is critical to&#13;
ensure sustainability of the project and the development of efficient land markets. Hence the&#13;
purpose of setting up a Provincial Project Facilitation Unit (PPFU) is to facilitate smooth&#13;
project implementation at the provincial level and to ensure support from provincial and&#13;
local authorities.&#13;
Functions. The PPFU will have the following functions:&#13;
(a)    Serve as Secretariat to the Provincial Oversight Committee (POC), including&#13;
the preparation of annual workplans and budgets for POC endorsement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
Annex I I&#13;
Page 8&#13;
(b)    Facilitate project implementation in the province, through (i) adequate&#13;
information of and solicitation of support from concerned provincial, district,&#13;
and village authorities; (ii) briefing of project staff and contractors on the&#13;
specific situation of the province or district; (iii) close coordination with the&#13;
Project Manager, Project Support Unit, the systematic registration contract&#13;
team, the TA team and the Project Management Agent and (iv) liaison with&#13;
the Provincial Technical Adviser.&#13;
(c)    Planning, monitoring,, and evaluation of project activities in the province,&#13;
including the preparation of annual workplans and budgets for endorsement by&#13;
the POC and submission to the Project NManager; the monitoring of&#13;
implementation of approved plans and performance indicators and submission&#13;
of monthly provincial progress reports to the PSU for compilation of project&#13;
progress reports and other reports which may be required by the GOL, IDA,&#13;
and AusAID; and the evaluation of project performance in the province and&#13;
preparation of recommendations on possible remedial action for the PSU.&#13;
(d)    Mvlaintenance of project accounts and verification of payments for expenditures&#13;
under provincial authority, such as salaries for PPFU staff and equipment,&#13;
including the financial management of GOL counterpart finds and submission&#13;
of consolidated monthly financial statements to the Project Manager.&#13;
Organizational Structure and Staffing. The PPFU will be headed by the Chief of the&#13;
Off-ice of Land and Housing Mslanagement, who will report to the Head of Finance&#13;
Services. The unit will have two functional area: (a) Project Facilitation and (b)&#13;
Plannigi'/i.Nloiitoring/Accotinting. Each area would be staffed with one local professional.&#13;
The unit would have also two clerical support staff and one driver.&#13;
Transfer of Know How Arrangements and Technical Assistance. Each PPFU will be&#13;
supported by a local Provincial Advisers to be funded under AusAID which will assist in the&#13;
implementation of project activities, specifically with regard to systematic land titling and&#13;
training.&#13;
&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall goal of the Land Titling
            Project is to strengthen the basis for long term sustainable
            economic and social development. In confirmation with this
            goal, the objectives of the project are to foster the
            development of efficient land markets and to facilitate
            domestic resource mobilization by providing a system of
            clear and enforceable land use ownership rights, and by
            developing a land valuation capacity. The project will
            support the first seven years of a longer term national land
            titling program aimed at extending secure land ownership and
            developing land administration and valuation systems,
            including compiling a cadastral mapping system. The main
            components of the project are: 1) completion of the policy
            and legal framework for land management and administration;
            2) implementation of an accelerated land titling program; 3)
            improvements in the infrastructure, facilities and systems
            for land administration; 4) improvements in land valuation;
            5) support for project management and implementation, and
            institutional strengthening; and 6) studies on community
            land tenure and registration, definition of forest
            boundaries, cost recovery, land rights issues on
            nationalized lands and socio-economic impact of land titling.
