            The restructuring and privatization of the
            U.K. electricity supply - was it worth it?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The electricity supply industry in
            England and Wales was under public ownership from 1948 to
            1990. For most of this period, the Central Electricity
            Generating Board (CEGB) operated all generation and
            transmission as a vertically integrated statutory monopoly.
            In 1990, the CEGB was restructured and privatized. This Note
            describes how a social cost-benefit analysis is conducted to
            assess the worthiness of the exercise and reports the
            results. The analysis shows that the effort was worth it.
            But there are two areas for improvement in the process of
            the restructuring and privatization. First, about a quarter
            of the net gains were transferred out of the country. If
            more attention had been paid to this possibility at the time
            of restructuring, some arrangement could probably have been
            found to prevent it. Second, introducing more competition in
            generation would have reduced excess entry and lowered
            prices, improving the distribution of the net benefits and
