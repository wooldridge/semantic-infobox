1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    The Government of Malawi has requested IDA's assistance in financing a primary education&#13;
project (PEP). This project is in response to a crisis caused by the surge in enrollment resulting from&#13;
the new Government's policy of eliminating all fees and associated costs of primary education.&#13;
Total primary school enrollments increased from about 1.9 million in 1993 to about 3.2 million in&#13;
1994, putting enormous strain on an already weak system. The quality of primary education is&#13;
particularly threatened, as up to 200 pupils fill each classroom and most of the twenty thousand&#13;
newly-recruited primary teachers have not been trained. In addition, despite an increase of budgetary&#13;
allocations to the sector, the current difficult macro-economic situation threatens to erode gains&#13;
associated with increased allocation of resources to the sector. However, the widespread and strong&#13;
political commitment to education from the current Government is expected to ease these serious&#13;
difficulties.&#13;
1.2    This project is being developed as a fast-track supplement to an overall integrated sector&#13;
credit aimed at financing a time-slice of the Government's long-term program for educational&#13;
development. The proposed PEP will focus on the following urgently needed activities: (i)&#13;
construction of about 1,600 primary classrooms and associated infrastructures; (ii) pedagogical&#13;
support and in-service teacher training particularly focused on the recently recruited teachers; and&#13;
(iii) provision of teaching and learning materials.&#13;
1.3    Total project costs are estimated at US$25.2 million, with a foreign exchange component of&#13;
about US$12.4 million. IDA would finance US$22.5 million (including a PPF of US$1.4 million).&#13;
The Government of Malawi would contribute about US$1.2 million equivalent including taxes and&#13;
duties; and communities would contribute the equivalent of US$1.6 million to the school&#13;
construction component of the project through contributions in cash or in kind.&#13;

2. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND: SOCIO ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND MACRO FRAMEWORK&#13;
2.1    Malawi is currently facing tough economic times, with the Government struggling with&#13;
macro imbalances caused by factors including expenditure overruns, the recent drought and civil&#13;
service wage increases. In 1994, real output growth shrank by 12.4% and the annual rate of inflation&#13;
was 34.7% (compared to 22.8% in 1993). The fiscal deficit including grants rose from about 5% in&#13;
1994 to about 15 % in 1995. Table I shows the evolution and projections of central government&#13;
expenditures, revenues and deficits between 1993 and 1998.&#13;

2.2    Notwithstanding the economic difficulties, the new democratically-elected Government of&#13;
Malawi has indicated its commitment to improve the quantity and quality of social sector&#13;
expenditures as a means to reaching its overall objective of reducing poverty. In expenditure&#13;
allocations on the recurrent account of this year's budget (1995/96), the Government's top priority&#13;
has been the social sectors, with 40.1% budgetary allocation compared to 31.1% in 1994/95. The&#13;
share of recurrent expenditure allocations for education rose from about 17% in 1994 to about 23.4%&#13;
in 1995 and is projected to increase to about 25% in 1996. Much of the increase in education&#13;
expenditures between 1994 and 1995 was aimed at accommodating and training the new teachers&#13;
hired to carry out the free primary education policy. To permit these increased social sector&#13;
expenditures and still meet deficit reduction targets, measures are underway to control overall&#13;
expenditures and improve revenue collection. These include: the restriction (or prohibition) on&#13;
filling new vacancies; a freeze on the hiring of temporary workers and the purchase of new vehicles;&#13;
and a reduction in external travel. There has also been a stricter application of the cash budgeting&#13;
system introduced in November, 1994. Measures were taken to enhance revenue by increasing the&#13;
efficiency of tax and tariff collection.  These measures have been effective in easing the&#13;
macroeconomic situation; halfway through FY96, the projected deficit is expected to stand at 4% of&#13;
GDP, including grants and excluding drought relief expenditures. Fiscal restraint will be reinforced&#13;
under the ongoing Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Under this, expenditure&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

frameworks have been established that prioritize sectoral programs and spending to ensure that&#13;
priority areas, such as the social sectors, are protected despite aggregate expenditure cuts. This&#13;
overall effort is receiving Bank assistance including the structural adjustment program now being&#13;
prepared.&#13;
2.3   It is urgent that economic stability be restored through reducing the current account deficit&#13;
on the balance of payments, increasing the level of external reserves, adopting monetary policies that&#13;
will ensure a stable exchange rate and reducing the government budget deficit and consequently the&#13;
level of inflation (to below 20%). Notwithstanding the need for such stabilization policies, some&#13;
priority expenditures in the social sectors (such as expenditures on primary education) need to be&#13;
protected and the Government is committed to providing that protection.&#13;
B. SECTOR BACKGROUND AND THE MALAWI EDUCATION CRISIS&#13;
2.4    Since Malawi gained its independence in 1964, significant progress has been made in the&#13;
development of its education system. The World Bank has long been active in assisting Malawi's&#13;
education sector; the first project was approved in 1967. Five additional education projects have&#13;
been completed since and currently there is an ongoing project (the Second Education Sector&#13;
Project). Although Malawi's education system has benefited considerably from the assistance of the&#13;
Bank and other donors, this support has not produced the desired benefits. This limited success is&#13;
due in part to lack of commitment by the former Government to education as well as the lack of a&#13;
well-conceived and comprehensive policy framework. In 1994 the Bank began to prepare a new&#13;
operation, the Third Education Sector Credit (TESC), which will pursue an integrated sector&#13;
approach (ISA) to support a Government-designed program for the development and improvement of&#13;
the sector as a whole. Through this approach, IDA will share in the financing of a time-slice of the&#13;
Government's overall program as specified in the Ministry of Education's draft Sector Policy&#13;
Framework Paper (SPFP). Donor coordination is an important aspect of the integrated sector&#13;
approach. Most donors active in the sector support the approach; some have already committed&#13;
resources to financing parts of the Government's program.&#13;
2.5    During the preparation of the TESC, the democratically-elected Government of Malawi&#13;
announced (in June 1994) that all primary school fees would be abolished as of the beginning of the&#13;
new school year in October, 1994. While this decision was consistent with the Government's overall&#13;
goal of poverty reduction through economic growth and investment in human capital, it created a&#13;
flood of over one million additional students into the primary system2, and necessitated the hiring of&#13;
about 20,000 new teachers. This was in effect a 75% increase over the existing primary teaching&#13;
force. The new teachers were mainly from among secondary school leavers, who were given only&#13;
three weeks of induction training before being dispatched to schools. Retired teachers were also&#13;
called back to help with the crisis. Government estimates that about 38,000 additional classrooms&#13;
will be required to accommodate this influx of children. At present classrooms are severely&#13;
overcrowded; thousands of children take their lessons in temporary facilities such as churches and&#13;
mosques. Thousands more assemble in the open air, under trees or are crammed into rooms; it is&#13;
common to see classes of two or three hundred children in a small shed. While "nominal" access to&#13;
schools has increased, "effective" access to education has not improved. The quality of education&#13;
has fallen -- many young children do not have enough teaching and learning materials and have only&#13;
a few young untrained teachers to guide them. Unless these pressing needs are quickly addressed,&#13;
2 There were approximately 1.9 million primary school children in the system before the recent influx.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
the public's enthusiastic support for primary education could quickly evaporate and be succeeded by&#13;
cynicism and apathy.&#13;
2.6    The current education crisis is the result of extreme pressures on an already weak system.&#13;
Notwithstanding the Government's effort to improve access to education, starting from a very low&#13;
base has meant that despite the very rapid rate of growth of primary enrollments (about 9.2% per&#13;
annum from 1985 to 1993), the primary gross enrollment ratio was only about 67% on average&#13;
between 1987-92, and adult literacy rate (aged 18 and over) was estimated to be around 40%.&#13;
However, the real problem in the education system has been that of quality, which has declined over&#13;
the years as indicated by high repetition and dropout rates. The repetition rate on average was over&#13;
20%, with only 19% of the (1980/81) intake completing primary school within the normal period. At&#13;
present, it normally takes a primary pupil about 15 years to complete the 8-year primary cycle. The&#13;
primary pupil-teacher ratio has progressively increased to 70 in 1992/93 with 13% unqualified&#13;
teachers; the primary pupil-classroom ratio was about 100 during the same year. These indicators&#13;
show that the primary education system was already extremely weak even before the recent crisis,&#13;
because of lack of qualified teachers, textbooks, classrooms, and other essential inputs.&#13;
C. MAIN SECTOR ISSUES&#13;
2.7    The Government's draft SPFP identifies the main issues confronting primary education in&#13;
Malawi as: (i) severe financial constraints and the problem of financing the recurrent costs of GOM's&#13;
educational development program; (ii) shortage of classrooms and acute overcrowding in schools&#13;
and classrooms; (iii) poor quality and low efficiency due in large part to the large number of&#13;
untrained teachers, especially the 20,000 recruited hurriedly after the introduction of free primary&#13;
education; (iv) ineffective sector management and support, especially the weaknesses in inspection&#13;
and supervisory functions; and (v) gender disparities, particularly at post-primary levels.&#13;
2.8    Severe Financial Constraints: Public resources within the education sector in Malawi are&#13;
utterly insufficient to cover the rapid surge in primary school enrollments observed in 1994.&#13;
Although public education recurrent spending in 1994/95 increased to about 7.5% of GDP, and&#13;
increased as a share of the Government's recurrent expenditures allocated to the education sector&#13;
from about 8.7% in 1988/89 to about 24% in 1994/953, there are still severe constraints for&#13;
improving the quantity and quality of education. Initial results from a simulation model for&#13;
educational development indicate that over the next five years, the education sector will need on&#13;
average nearly 30% of public resources to meet the recurrent costs of the Government's education&#13;
development program. The already low public spending dedicated to quality enhancement items is&#13;
declining. In 1990/91, non-salary recurrent expenditure per primary school student was 11.5% of&#13;
public recurrent spending on education; in 1994/95, this share declined to 3%. This decline was&#13;
influenced by the rise in enrollments and in corresponding teacher requirements unsupported by a&#13;
proportional increase in budgetary allocations for non-wage items.&#13;
2.9    The severe financial constraints confronting the education sector require bold measures,&#13;
many of which are envisaged in the SPFP. These include: increased cost recovery at post-primary&#13;
education levels; increased community involvement which will be a significant part of this project;&#13;
cost-saving measures such as more secondary day schooling and double-shifting; encouragement of&#13;
the private sector in the construction, maintenance and operation of schools; and the choice of least-&#13;
cost alternatives in project design (such as the shell classroom construction design and the teacher&#13;
3 The priority accorded to primary education is also evident from the increase in the share of public recurrent education&#13;
spending from 45% in 1990/91 to 71% in 1994/95.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
training approach developed in this project). In fact, providing more resources to the sector will be&#13;
important but lifting monetary resource constraints will not suffice; the efficiency of expenditures&#13;
and of delivery systems must be improved. Some donor financing of recurrent expenditures on an&#13;
increasing or constant basis over the next five years (for example under the proposed TESC&#13;
operation) will provide short-term relief, help set up these measures and ensure long-term&#13;
sustainability so that such recurrent costs could be financed on a declining basis in subsequent IDA /&#13;
other donor operations.&#13;
2.10   Shortage of Classrooms and Acute Over-crowding of Schools and Classrooms: The&#13;
limited facilities that existed before 1994 are now over-stretched and acute overcrowding is the&#13;
norm, especially in the larger urban centers. In many schools, classes are organized under trees and&#13;
in mosques and churches. The Government estimates a need of about 38,000 new classrooms to&#13;
attain a ratio of about 60 pupils per classroom. Meanwhile, although access to primary schooling has&#13;
increased (the net enrollment rate for primary education in Malawi has risen to around 70% while the&#13;
gross enrollment rate is over 100%), equity issues still need to be addressed. The results obtained&#13;
from the 1990/91 household survey (HESSEA) indicate that disparities in net and gross rates across&#13;
income levels are considerable. For example the poorest group has only 30% net and 60% gross&#13;
enrollment rates in contrast with the richest group with its 75% net and 110% gross rate. The survey&#13;
also shows that enrollment ratios are lower in rural than in urban areas, especially in the central and&#13;
southern regions of the country. The location of the new schools and expansion of existing schools&#13;
under this project will take these disparities and the problem of overcrowding into consideration.&#13;
2.11   Poor Quality and Low Efficiency: Because of the surge in enrollment, about 20,000 new&#13;
teachers were recruited, most of them untrained school leavers (25% with full secondary education&#13;
and 75% with only JCE). About 4,000 retired teachers were recalled from retirement. Most new&#13;
recruits were given three weeks of crash training before being dispatched to schools. Consequently,&#13;
teacher upgrading, in the most cost-effective manner possible, is an urgent priority. The weaknesses&#13;
in inspection and supervisory functions have also limited the support provided to teachers. These&#13;
functions should be strengthened and school-based supervision and support should be provided.&#13;
2.12   Gender Disparities:  Historically, girls in Malawi have not gone to school in as great&#13;
numbers as boys; drop out rates are higher for girls at both primary and secondary levels, and&#13;
achievement rates are low for girls, especially in mathematics and science. Over half of enrolled&#13;
girls leave school during early primary grades before they attain full literacy. Of those who stayed, it&#13;
took an average of 16 years for girls to complete the 8-year primary education cycle, as opposed to&#13;
13 years for boys. Low enrollment is particularly apparent in secondary schools, where less than&#13;
39% of the places at secondary schools (in 1994/95) are held by girls. The reasons for these low&#13;
rates include: retention problems; school and associated fees4; parents' perception of low return to&#13;
girls' education; poor performance on Standard 8 exams; limited places at boarding schools; early&#13;
marriage; and pregnancy, after which until very recently girls were not permitted to return to school.&#13;
2.13   Girls' participation and performance in primary education has recently improved. This&#13;
overall improvement has been reinforced by USAID's Girls' Attainment in Basic Literacy and&#13;
Education (GABLE) Project, launched in 1991. Under the project, school fee waivers were&#13;
introduced for non-repeating girls (before the abolition of all fees); Government launched a social&#13;
mobilization campaign to encourage girls to complete their schooling, and to change attitudes and&#13;
elicit support from parents and communities. Substantial progress was also made in revising the&#13;
4 These include fees for uniforms, textbooks and learning materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
curriculum to be more gender appropriate5. The success of the GABLE project resulted in increased&#13;
female enrollment6 and a reduction in female dropout and repetition rates.  Thus, the general&#13;
enrollment increase in primary education has been accompanied by a fall in the gap in Gross&#13;
Enrollment Ratios (GER) between girls and boys, from a 15% gap in 1986/87 (GER of 47% for girls&#13;
and 62% for boys) to an 11% gap in 1992/93 (GER of 70% for girls and 81% for boys); the gap was&#13;
only 4% in 1993/94 (91% for girls and 95% for boys). In a few years, this gap will be closed.&#13;
2.14   Notwithstanding the overall progress made at the primary level, significant gender disparities&#13;
still exist at the upper-primary, post-primary and regional levels. The results obtained from the&#13;
1990/91 household survey (HESSEA) confirm that although gender disparities are not severe&#13;
nationally in primary education, the rural South region shows boys with an enrollment rate 25%&#13;
higher than girls, (probably due to the later development of education in the region) and a gross&#13;
enrollment ratio about 20% higher for boys than girls in the urban North. There are enrollment&#13;
disparities in class levels, where the share of girls in upper primary grades has remained in the mid&#13;
20% for the past several years. Under this project, gender disparities will figure prominently among&#13;
the criteria in classroom site selection for districts. The project will also monitor the development of&#13;
the SPFP to ensure that gender issues at post-primary levels are adequately addressed under the&#13;
upcoming Third Education Sector Credit, especially the redefinition of the Gender Appropriate&#13;
Curriculum Unit's roles and responsibilities to include the revision of the secondary curriculum to&#13;
incorporate gender issues. Scholarship programs and school fee waivers are also being considered.&#13;
D. GOVERNMENT EDUCATION SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
2.15   Government has recently undertaken an intensive review of its policies and priorities in the&#13;
education sector. The results of Government's efforts are set out in the Sector Policy Framework&#13;
Paper (SPFP) that will be used to guide the overall development of the sector in the next decade and&#13;
coordinate the efforts of donors under the ISA. The Framework Paper emphasizes primary education&#13;
and sets ambitious targets for improving school quality and girls' participation. For example,&#13;
primary school net enrollment is to increase to 90 percent for each district, with girls making up one&#13;
half of those enrolled; pupil-teacher ratios are to drop from an average of about 70:1 now to 45:1 by&#13;
2005, and one textbook for each pupil in each of the three main subjects is to be required. The&#13;
principal measures for achieving these targets are higher budgetary allocations to education in&#13;
general and to the primary subsector in particular, greater community and private sector participation&#13;
in both the construction and operation of primary and secondary schools, and increased construction&#13;
and focus on community schools (Grades 1-4) combined with a social mobilization campaign aimed&#13;
at girls and their parents. For post-primary education, more day schooling (rather than the currently&#13;
predominant policy of boarding) and increased cost recovery are envisaged. The priorities outlined&#13;
in the SPFP will parallel those spelled out in the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and&#13;
agreed with MOF, thus facilitating adequate funding of the program in future years.&#13;
2.16   In June 1995, a draft of the SPFP was distributed to donors, NGOs, and other key&#13;
stakeholders to solicit comments and reactions. While reactions have generally been favorable,&#13;
several revisions were requested to ensure sustainability of the policies. The Bank's input included a&#13;
5 The Gender Appropriate Curriculum (GAC) Unit located at the Malawi Institute of Education has completed the primary&#13;
curriculum up to Standard 5.&#13;
6 The overall percentage of girls in school has risen from 45% to 47% since the GABLE waivers began. Note that 52% of&#13;
the Malawi population is female. In 1992/93, for the first time, the number of girls enrolling in standard I exceeded&#13;
the number of boys (51% up from 49% the previous year).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
request for more realistic estimation of recurrent and investment expenditures and more explicit&#13;
description of cost recovery measures at the secondary and tertiary levels.  During appraisal,&#13;
Government agreed to take these comments into consideration and set the following benchmarks&#13;
towards "finalization" of the SPFP7:&#13;
* In early October 1995, the Cabinet Committee on Education reviewed the initial draft of the&#13;
SPFP and discussed the task of the PEP within this framework. An action plan and timetable&#13;
was proposed for completion of the document.&#13;
* Towards the end of November 1995, the Ministry of Education presented a revised SPFP to key&#13;
stakeholders in the sector (donors, NGOs, and other members of civil society) that responded to&#13;
their comments concerning prioritization and affordability. A strategy for ensuring an ongoing&#13;
and broad policy dialogue for the forthcoming year has been agreed. Recognizing the fact that&#13;
the SPFP is in fact a "living" document, some allocation has been made within PEP to finance&#13;
some of the actions aimed at broadening the dialogue further on the policy framework and&#13;
refining the document.&#13;
* By end-December 1995, the Ministry will present the revised SPFP with its executive summary&#13;
to the Cabinet Committee on Education for approval and endorsement.&#13;
So before Board presentation, the Government will submit to IDA a prioritized summary of its&#13;
policies and programs in the sector as a whole in a manner that clearly demonstrates that a critical&#13;
assessment of trade-offs and policy options has been applied to arrive at programs and targets that&#13;
are affordable and sustainable.&#13;
E. THE BANK GROUP'S ROLE AND STRATEGY&#13;
2.17   Past and Ongoing Involvement: The Bank has long been active in assisting Malawi's&#13;
education sector. The first project was approved in 1967. Five additional education projects have&#13;
been completed since then. Further details on these completed projects are given in Annex 12.&#13;
Currently, there is one ongoing project (the Second Education Sector Project), bringing the number&#13;
of education projects to seven, for a total of about US$175 million.&#13;
2.18   The on-going project, the Second Education Sector Credit (Cr. 2083-MAI, scheduled to&#13;
close on 30 June, 1996) began in 1990. The project objectives are: providing roofs for primary&#13;
school buildings and teachers' houses; providing classroom furniture; providing science kits for&#13;
secondary schools; improving library services to secondary schools; expanding Malawi Centres for&#13;
Distance Education (MCDEs) and in-service teachers' training; developing curricula and textbooks;&#13;
strengthening administration of the PIU; and providing technical assistance to MIE as well as to the&#13;
Faculty of Commerce of the Malawi Polytechnic (including scholarships). In 1994 the Bank began&#13;
to prepare a new operation, the Third Education Sector Credit (TESC), which will pursue an&#13;
integrated sector approach to support a Government-designed program to develop and improve the&#13;
sector as a whole. However, given the severity of the current crisis facing primary education in&#13;
Malawi, the Bank has agreed to the Government's request of 'fast-tracking' urgently needed primary&#13;
school activities of the TESC under a separate project, the PEP.&#13;
7 The SPFP is intended to serve as an operational document that Govemment regularly uses as a forum to debate and reach&#13;
consensus with stakeholders on priorities in the sector and to identify the costs associated with meeting these priorities.&#13;
"Completion" of the document does not exclude further consultation, revision and change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
2.19   Lessons from  Previous IDA Involvement:  Unlike previous projects which provided&#13;
loosely-structured interventions, and thus resulted in limited impact, this project, and the TESC will&#13;
share in the financing of a time-slice of the Government's overall program. By working within this&#13;
framework, the projects should be more effective in improving the sector. Specific lessons learnt&#13;
from implementing past projects have been incorporated in designing this operation. The design of&#13;
classroom construction has been modified to reduce construction time and cost and maximize&#13;
community participation. The school designs will consist of a shell which communities will&#13;
complete with in-fills. This approach is expected to build a strong sense of ownership of schools by&#13;
the local communities. Communities did not participate as fully as expected under the First&#13;
Education Sector Credit as reported in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for that project&#13;
(see Annex 12, para. 2 for further details); thus the communities' participation under PEP will not be&#13;
taken for granted. A vigorous IEC campaign and community mobilization exercise (in collaboration&#13;
with MASAF) as well as training for district and community leaders, are planned. An incentive&#13;
mechanism for communities has been built into the project by making the provision and delivery of&#13;
furniture and learning materials to the new classrooms conditional on the completion of the infills.&#13;
Project implementation will be expedited by modifying the contracting arrangements so that&#13;
contracts are awarded through a private and independent construction management organization&#13;
(PICMO). Similarly, textbook distribution will be privatized.&#13;
2.20   Bank Strategy:  The Bank's education sector strategy is aimed at supporting the&#13;
implementation of a time-slice of the Government's educational development program in&#13;
collaboration with other donors through the TESC. However, to respond immediately to the crisis&#13;
facing primary education in Malawi, activities that are focused, ready, simple, and capable of being&#13;
implemented quickly have been selected from the TESC for fast-track processing under a separate&#13;
Primary Education Project (PEP). Both the PEP and TESC are consistent with the Bank's Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS) in Malawi, presented to the Board on June 9, 1994 (Report No. P6236-&#13;
MAI). The major objective of the CAS is sustainable poverty reduction through economic growth&#13;
with equity. To attain this objective the strategy focuses on: (i) expanding access to human capital&#13;
through improved education, health and other social services; (ii) expanding employment&#13;
opportunities through a liberal environment for private sector entrepreneurship and initiative,&#13;
expanded access to financial capital, and policies and programs that encourage labor-intensive&#13;
activities and participation of women; (iii) enhancing agricultural productivity for poor, small&#13;
farmers and ensuring sustainable use of land resources; and (iv) introduction of an integrated family-&#13;
planning strategy to curb population growth and reduce fertility rates.&#13;
2.21   Education is central to all four dimensions of the strategy and the focus on primary education&#13;
is crucial. In developing and implementing the Bank's education strategy, an iterative process has&#13;
been used with feedback from systematic client consultation (SCC). As the findings of a 1995 SCC&#13;
exercise carried out in the country show,8 communities ranked the need for schools as one of the two&#13;
top priorities (the other was credit).  Many communities have been participating in the&#13;
implementation of school construction, through labor and monetary contribution; some have even&#13;
generated, managed and implemented their projects without assistance from outside. Communities&#13;
consistently ranked school committees as valued for their ability to deliver relevant services. This&#13;
seems to validate the contention that communities have the provision of schools as their top priority&#13;
and that with some facilitation, communities will be enthusiastic participants to this end. The SCC&#13;
confirms that: (i) there is a high demand for education and communities give top priority to it; (ii)&#13;
communities are willing to contribute to school construction and maintenance; and (iii) communities&#13;
8The SCC was done for the Malawi Social Action Fund project preparation. Nineteen representative communities in all&#13;
three regions were surveyed .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
are interested in participating as early as possible in development projects affecting them. These&#13;
factors were all taken into consideration when designing this project. The project combines a supply&#13;
orientation (to provide a quick response to this high demand for education by the communities and to&#13;
facilitate their involvement) with a demand-driven approach (through the active involvement of the&#13;
communities). An IEC campaign and community mobilization are underway; some training for&#13;
community members and leaders as well as district officials has already been undertaken (like the&#13;
training in the use of hydraform machines and in the techniques of cladding - see Annex 8) and more&#13;
training is envisaged under the project. Regular feedback will also be sollicited from participating&#13;
communities and this information will be used to improve the training programs and project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2.22   Rationale for IDA Involvement: Poverty alleviation and human resource development are&#13;
at the centre of IDA's strategy in Malawi (articulated in the Country Assistance Strategy Paper that&#13;
was presented to the Board on June 9, 1994 - see details in para. 2.20) because these are essential&#13;
elements of the country's development approach. IDA has been active in Malawi's education system&#13;
for the last thirty years. It has incorporated the lessons learned in project preparation and&#13;
implementation over those years and is now well positioned to assist the sector to implement the&#13;
Government's sector development plan. PEP will provide timely assistance to at least partially&#13;
alleviate the extreme pressure the primary education system now faces.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE&#13;
3.1    Development Objectives: The main objective of this project is to assist the Government of&#13;
Malawi in its efforts at poverty reduction and capacity building. The project is being developed as a&#13;
fast-track forerunner to an overall integrated sector operation aimed at assisting the Government of&#13;
Malawi implement a time-slice of its long term education sector development program. The main&#13;
objectives of the program are to provide access to primary education to 90% of school-age children&#13;
by the year 2005, expand access to lower secondary education, improve quality and resource use at&#13;
all levels of education, and strengthen planning and management in the sector. Within that&#13;
framework, this project aims at putting on fast-track selected activities of the program to provide a&#13;
rapid response to the Malawian educational crisis which followed the elimination of all school fees&#13;
and associated costs of primary education in 1994. These activities have been identified as among&#13;
the most critical for poverty reduction and for providing the foundation for capacity building.&#13;
3.2    Specific Project Objectives: The specific objectives of this fast-track operation are to: (i)&#13;
ensur-e that the quantitative gains in enrollments obtained with the introduction of free primary&#13;
education are maintained through the retention of newly-enrolled children in the system; and (ii)&#13;
improve the quality of primary education through providing teaching and learning materials, and&#13;
pedagogical support to, and in-service training for untrained teachers.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.3    The three main project components, all focused on primary education, are: (i) classroom&#13;
construction; (ii) pedagogical support and in-service teacher training; and (iii) teaching and learning&#13;
materials.&#13;
Component 1: Primary Classroom Construction Program (US$11.8 million)&#13;
3.4    Objectives and Scope of Component: The Ministry of Education estimates that 38,000&#13;
classrooms will be required over the next ten years to reduce serious overcrowding and to move&#13;
towards a student: classroom ratio of 60:1. This ambitious construction program will require an&#13;
improvement in current designs and implementation practices. In response to the high demand for&#13;
classrooms, over 50% of project funds will be allocated to primary school infrastructure. The overall&#13;
goal for civil works is to provide as many well-built classrooms as quickly and as cost-effectively as&#13;
possible, and to provide teachers' housing and administration blocks in appropriate proportion.&#13;
Health and hygiene needs will require the construction of pit latrines and boreholes at most primary&#13;
school sites. Sapling shade trees will be planted at all new sites to provide a shade canopy for the&#13;
many hot months of school attendance.&#13;
3.5    Activities to be Supported: The project would finance the construction and provision of&#13;
furniture for about 1600 primary classrooms. Of this total, 600 will be in 75 new sites (new primary&#13;
schools) mainly in rural areas; the other 1000 will expand existing schools with overcrowded&#13;
classrooms especially in peri-urban and some rural areas. The project would finance the construction&#13;
of an administration block, two teacher houses, two pit latrines and a borehole in each of the new&#13;
schools and the planting of sapling shade trees at all new sites. Before appraisal, Government&#13;
undertook a school location exercise to determine the communities in which the new schools will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
located as well as those in which schools will be expanded. To ensure that the exercise was carried&#13;
out in a transparent manner, the Bank assisted MOE in identifying objective criteria and developing a&#13;
formula to rank districts, zones or communities on the basis of these criteria (see annex 3c for&#13;
details). The criteria include: poverty level, average number of pupils per classroom, population&#13;
density, gender disparity and average enrollment ratios. Once identified, the communities are&#13;
required to select the sites for the new schools and prepare them for construction (mainly by clearing&#13;
the sites). Before negotiations the Government submitted the list of districts in which classrooms&#13;
will be constructed. As a condition of Board Presentation the Government will submit the list of the&#13;
sites selected in consultation with the communities where new schools will be constructed as well as&#13;
the names of the existing schools to be expanded, ensuring that this list contains at least 80% of the&#13;
total number of classrooms to be constructed under this primary school construction component of&#13;
the project.&#13;
3.6    Classroom Construction Using Shell Concept: Because of the serious and immediate need&#13;
for classrooms (as well as the need for cost-effectiveness), a shell design has been selected for fast&#13;
track classroom construction. The Ministry of Works and Supplies (MOWS) completed designs for&#13;
shell-type structures in July 1995. The Bank's Project Preparation Facility (PPF), which is a pilot for&#13;
this fast-track project, is financing the construction of 96 classroom steel shells, along with teacher&#13;
houses, administration blocks, and site services. The steel shell design has already been tested in&#13;
Malawi by UNICEF, on a smaller scale. The results from all these pilot operations have been&#13;
positive. Communities have shown a lot of enthusiasm for the project and the role they will play in&#13;
its implementation. They have already moulded large amounts of blocks using the hydraform&#13;
machines. Annex 3g provides further analyses of alternative construction designs considered before&#13;
selecting the shell design. Alternative shell types will be used only if these prove to be as cost-&#13;
effective, as quick to construct and as durable as the steel shell design selected. Although the shell&#13;
design is new to Malawi, it has a track record in Africa, notably with the Bank's ongoing primary&#13;
school construction project in Ghana. The shell model is a low-cost high-quality classroom design&#13;
with construction across two stages:&#13;
&#149;  Stage I: Putting up the Shells by Contractors.  A foundation, columns, and a roof are&#13;
constructed.  The contractor is also responsible for installing the floor. The shell can be&#13;
constructed very quickly, permitting school children to move to the shade and shelter of a&#13;
classroom shell.&#13;
*  Stage 1I: Infills through Community Participation.  The walls are constructed. Doors and&#13;
windows, a closet, and a permanent chalkboard are installed. The infill stage does not require&#13;
the same high level of construction skills as does the installation of a foundation, and the&#13;
erection of columns and a tied-down roof. The infill stage lends itself well to community inputs&#13;
involving skills and materials that are readily available and which may vary from region to&#13;
region. Most communities will use hydraform blocks; others have a stockpile of already burnt&#13;
bricks. Other communities may choose to construct walls of traditional sun-dried bricks. The&#13;
production of additional burnt bricks will be discouraged because of the environmental damage&#13;
caused by the large number of trees that must be felled to burn bricks.&#13;
3.7    The shell model brings together high technology and traditional building skills. The shell&#13;
model implies a natural division of inputs. By awarding large contracts to the efficient private&#13;
sector, Government will quickly construct useable classroom shells throughout the country. Using&#13;
their own abilities and resources, the communities will complete the classroom shells provided by&#13;
Government. During appraisal, prototypical draft architectural designs for the construction of shell&#13;
classrooms were submitted to the Bank for review. Minor revisions were suggested and these have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
been incorporated in the final designs which are being used currently for the construction of&#13;
classrooms under PPF financing.&#13;
3.8    Orientation of District Officials and Community Leaders: The assistance of district&#13;
officials will be required to mobilize the community in completing the classroom shells. Orientation&#13;
sessions of 2-3 days will be held for key officials from each district; project implementation officials&#13;
will act as trainers (see annex 8 for details on some of the training that has already been undertaken).&#13;
These orientation sessions must be held before the project becomes effective and will be repeated&#13;
periodically. At the village level, community leaders will be invited to take part in orientation&#13;
workshops.  The goal of these workshops is to instill a sense of school ownership in the&#13;
communities. The orientation is intended to increase enthusiasm and commitment to complete and&#13;
maintain the shells. Up to three leaders from each community, including a traditional chief with&#13;
recognized local authority, will take part in the workshops.&#13;
3.9    NGO  Involvement in  the  School Construction  Program:   Non-governmental&#13;
organizations have recently become very active in Malawi; their increasing role has been stimulated&#13;
by two major events; the increased number of refugees and the introduction of democracy which has&#13;
opened doors for NGO activities. Most NGOs have a comparative advantage in the social sectors,&#13;
given their proximity to grass root levels, and also have existing capacity (though not nationwide in&#13;
Malawi) to deal with community-based assignments. The communities will be crucial to the success&#13;
of the PEP as both beneficiaries and implementors of the project. And NGOs would be very&#13;
significant in community mobilization, sensitization, capacity building and training for leadership&#13;
and transformation, selection of high caliber people, and putting into place monitoring and&#13;
evaluation mechanisms.&#13;
3.10   This project will finance activities related to community mobilization and development.&#13;
These would include the participation of NGOs as resource persons for training and capacity&#13;
building efforts at the community level and to provide technical assistance for community&#13;
mobilization. NGO involvement in this project will help expedite the uptake and facilitate greater&#13;
awareness of the communities as to how the project has been structured. Furthermore, the project&#13;
will help MOE put in place an information system that will help identify appropriate NGOs to&#13;
participate in the project in each relevant district. This will require gathering adequate information&#13;
about the NGO sector; establishing, in a transparent manner, relevant selection criteria (NGOs will&#13;
be part of the process to define these criteria), and a suitable selection process; assessing the&#13;
organizational capacity and proven track record relevant to project tasks; and identifying what would&#13;
be 'capacity-building' needs and strategies to meet these needs.&#13;
3.11   Information, Education and Communication (IEC): The activities under the PEP that&#13;
require community and NGO participation will have to be effectively presented and well explained&#13;
to the communities.  Malawi has gone through a tremendous transformation with regard to&#13;
community involvement. The self-help spirit which used to exist was interrupted during the political&#13;
transition. The return of self-help must be carefully handled to make it strong and sustainable. A&#13;
well articulated IEC campaign is necessary to impart the importance of providing schools, especially&#13;
the approach to school construction used in this project. The approach PEP will use is new in many&#13;
ways, and may cause some confusion among the communities. MOE would operate IEC campaigns&#13;
where the project will go, well before its implementation. The IEC packages would contain among&#13;
other data, information about the project, community involvement, identify tasks to be fulfilled by&#13;
Government officials in different capacities, describe NGOs who happen to be in the locality, and&#13;
identify community leaders and other leaders. PEP would fund MOE's efforts of organizing this IEC&#13;
campaign. An initial IEC campaign is underway under the PPF phase. This campaign is being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
developed in collaboration with that being undertaken under the Malawi Social Action Project&#13;
(MASAF).&#13;
Component 2: Pedagogical Support and Teacher Training Program (US$4.7 million)&#13;
3.12   Background and Objectives: The Ministry of Education has recognized that support to&#13;
teachers needs to be improved. In its effort to move from an inspection-based system to one that&#13;
supports teachers' development, the Government has changed the name of the Inspectorate to the&#13;
Methods Advisory Service, and the local inspectors are now called Primary Education Advisors&#13;
(PEAs). More PEAs have been added and these advisors are based in recently-created sub-zones.&#13;
Ultimately each PEA will be responsible for 10-15 schools or 160 teachers. Altogether about 320&#13;
PEAs will be deployed throughout the country. As part of the preparation for the TESC, the&#13;
Methods Advisory Service has articulated a scheme for school-based supervision in which school&#13;
heads and PEAs would provide pedagogical leadership at the school level. A plan for implementing&#13;
this scheme has been prepared by the Ministry of Education with assistance from GTZ, ODA, and&#13;
the World Bank, all of whom have expressed willingness to support elements of the plan9.&#13;
3.13   The introduction of free primary education for the 1994-95 academic year has made the need&#13;
for the planned improvements in teacher support more urgent. To respond to the enrollment&#13;
increase, the Government recruited about 20,000 mainly untrained primary teachers. With some&#13;
3,400 untrained teachers already in the system, about half of the over 48,000 teachers in the field&#13;
now are uncertified. This has further depressed an already poor learning environment. There is an&#13;
urgent need to improve the classroom effectiveness of all teachers in order to improve the quality of&#13;
education.&#13;
3.14   The long-term goal of this component is to improve the learning in Malawi's primary&#13;
schools by establishing a teacher support system that provides regular, sustained assistance to every&#13;
school and teacher. Building on the outposting of the PEAs, the Government proposes to create a&#13;
resource center in each sub-zone, the position at which the PEAs are to be posted. PEAs will spend&#13;
over half their time in schools assisting school heads to improve the performance of teachers. The&#13;
resource centers will support this school-level work by providing a gathering place and training site&#13;
for teachers and school heads. At the same time, there is a clear need to create a mechanism to&#13;
coordinate the array of institutions that guide the delivery of pedagogical support to teachers -- the&#13;
Methods Advisory Service, teacher training colleges, Malawi Institute of Education, Malawi&#13;
National Examinations Board, Teachers Union of Malawi; NGOs; Malawi College of Distance&#13;
Education, and the Faculty of Education at the University of Malawi.&#13;
3.15   Activities to be Supported:  This component will provide support to: (a) the Malawi&#13;
Integrated In-service Teacher Education Program (MIITEP) for certification of untrained teachers,&#13;
and (b) pedagogical support for all primary teachers. MOE has involved ODA, GTZ/KfW and the&#13;
Bank in planning this program.  Consequently these donors have agreed to provide parallel&#13;
financing. ODA has indicated interest in supporting the following activities: (i) training and support&#13;
for headquarters and regional education office staff, district and deputy district education officers,&#13;
primary education advisors (PEAs), headteachers and deputy heads; (ii) construction of up to 100&#13;
resource centers; (iii) strengthening of MIE, and; (iv) technical assistance. ODA's contribution in&#13;
support of these four activities will reach US$8.5 million. KfW will also provide parallel support&#13;
9 (see Inspection and Supervision of Education in Malawi: Creating Conditions for Improving Learning in Schools. June,&#13;
1994; Proposed Framework for Strengthening Inspection and Supervision of Primary Education in Malawi, December,&#13;
1994; and Strengthening Supervision, In-service Education &amp; Training in Malawian Primary Schools, Februarv, 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
through constructing about 20 resource centers and 400 primary classrooms for an overall total&#13;
amount of approximately US$8.0 million) while GTZ will provide technical assistance (about&#13;
US$3.0 million). The activities to be supported by the Bank are designed to complement those to be&#13;
funded by these donors.&#13;
3.16   In effect, the long-term needs for pedagogical support to teachers will be addressed by&#13;
TESC, with the support of other donors. Under this project, only immediate and urgent needs are&#13;
targeted. These include:&#13;
1. Preparatory activities for the implementation of the Teacher Development Program&#13;
(TDP) which would include: (i) setting up an apex coordinating body; (ii) design of&#13;
curricula; (iii) development of training manuals, modules and handbooks; (iv) training of&#13;
trainers; and (v) staff development. In addition a campaign to inform all key players&#13;
about the program and their tasks in it would be launched immediately.&#13;
2. Planning and preparation of course materials and the implementation of the MIITEP&#13;
aimed at about 20,000 untrained teachers. MIITEP will start in January, 1997 with 3,000&#13;
students for a three-month residential course. Thereafter, the students will be deployed&#13;
to schools and continue their training for 21 months through sub-zonal seminars and&#13;
supervised teaching in schools. A formative evaluation will be conducted after three&#13;
consecutive residential courses. To be certified, students will be required to write a final&#13;
examination in addition to writing a specified number of projects and assignments.&#13;
3. School and sub-zonal in-service training for all primary teachers. Each resource center&#13;
and school will be provided with a set of teaching and learning materials packages.&#13;
4. Provision of motorcycles (including operation and maintenance) for about 320 PEAs to&#13;
enhance their mobility to visit schools.&#13;
3.17   The activities supported, including the use of the motorcycles, will be directed towards&#13;
improving the quality of primary education. The build-up of these activities commencing with the&#13;
PEP (see Annex 3f for details on the teacher training program and the comparison of alternatives to&#13;
arrive at the selected program) will be extended into TESC. Under TESC a comprehensive Teacher&#13;
Development Program, including secondary, technical and vocational education and training, will be&#13;
implemented.&#13;
Component 3: Learning Materials and Textbook-related Activities (US$3.1 million)&#13;
3.18   Background and Objectives: The ongoing Second Education Sector Credit has a major&#13;
component for the development, production and distribution of textbooks to all primary school&#13;
grades, with a planned target of one textbook for every two students and one guide for each teacher&#13;
in Mathematics, Chichewa, English, and General Studies. However, there is a huge current demand&#13;
for additional textbooks and learning materials resulting from the massive influx of children into the&#13;
system. This need is being felt most in grades I - 4. MOE estimates that about 4 million additional&#13;
textbooks are required for these four grades alone to enable the Government to attain its target of one&#13;
textbook for every two students in each of the four main subjects. Meanwhile, there is also a need to&#13;
improve the distribution of textbooks and learning materials. The Supplies Unit (SU) which was&#13;
recently established within MOE to implement Government's procurement and distribution of&#13;
textbooks and learning materials needs to be strengthened. There is a need to undertake an&#13;
evaluation of the content and durability of the textbooks developed under the Second Education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Sector Credit in order to prepare for revised editions under the TESC. There is also a need to train&#13;
teachers and primary education advisers (PEAs) in the effective use and management of textbooks.&#13;
3.19   Activities to be Supported:   To help meet the additional demand for textbooks in the&#13;
four main subjects at grades I to 4, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is&#13;
providing parallel support of about US$7.5 million equivalent for the reprinting of about 5 million&#13;
textbooks using the films of the titles developed under the IDA-financed Second Education Sector&#13;
Credit. For its part, PEP would concentrate on the:&#13;
* Acquisition of basic learning materials, including exercise books, pencils, slates, chalk and&#13;
boards;&#13;
* Furnishing of secured book storage rooms in new primary schools;&#13;
*  Strengthening of the Supplies Unit of MOE including the computerization of book-distribution&#13;
operations and provision of associated training and technical assistance;&#13;
*  Training of teachers and primary education advisers on effective use and management of&#13;
textbooks; and&#13;
*  Evaluation of the content and durability of textbooks developed under the IDA-financed Second&#13;
Education Sector Credit.&#13;
C. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.20   The total project cost is estimated at US$25.2 million equivalent. The foreign exchange&#13;
component of the project is estimated at 49.0% (US$12.4 million) of total cost. Total base cost&#13;
estimates are US$20.1 million at October 1995 prices. Physical and price contingencies are&#13;
estimated at US$5.1 million, with physical contingencies representing 5.0% of base costs. Price&#13;
contingencies, estimated at US$4.1 million, assume an average local annual inflation rate of about&#13;
15.0% and an average foreign annual inflation rate of about 2.0% during the three years of project&#13;
implementation. A summary cost table is given in Table 2 while detailed cost estimates are given in&#13;

million); Government and communities would finance about 4.8% and 6.2% respectively&#13;
(approximately US$1.2 million and US$1.6 million equivalent respectively). Parallel financing&#13;
totaling about US$27.0 million equivalent is being provided by KFW (about US$8 million for the&#13;
construction of 400 primary classrooms and 20 Resource Centers); CIDA (about US$7.5 for the&#13;
provision of textbooks; ODA (about US$8.5 million for the training of head teachers and PEAs as&#13;
well as the construction of 100 resource centers under the TDP); and GTZ (about US$3.0 million for&#13;
technical assistance under the TDP).&#13;

3.22   Recurrent Cost Implications: Incremental recurrent costs to the Government generated by&#13;
this project concern three major elements: (i) operating cost of project-supported institutions and&#13;
programs (244,000 MK or US$15,250 per annum); (ii) transitory incremental salary costs associated&#13;
with project management and coordination (79,000 MK or about US$5,000 per annum). Meanwhile&#13;
there will be an increase in teachers' salaries after certification following completion of the teacher&#13;
training program being organized for about 20,000 untrained teachers: only part of the recurrent cost&#13;
implications are attributable to PEP10. To assess the fiscal feasibility and recurrent cost implications&#13;
of its overall investment program contained in its policy framework paper, the MOE is using a&#13;
simulation model for education (developed by UNESCO in 1991) to develop alternative scenarios as&#13;
well as to undertake counterfactual policy simulations. Details on the model are contained in Annex&#13;
3d.&#13;
3.23   Public resources within the education sector in Malawi are insufficient to cover the rapid&#13;
surge in primary school enrollments observed in 1994. Although recurrent education expenditures as&#13;
a share of total public recurrent expenditures increased from 8.7% in 1988 to 24% in 1995 and the&#13;
share of education in GNP more than doubled from 3.4% to 7.5%, there are still severe constraints to&#13;
improving the quantity and quality of education. The very young population profile creates an&#13;
immense need for human capital investment in education. About 34% of Malawians are in the&#13;
school age group of 6 to 17 years. The simulation results indicate that over the next decade, it would&#13;
10 The average annual teacher salary before certification of the approximately 20,000 untrained teachers is 7000 MK (about&#13;
US$ 460) and will increase to 9,500 MK (about US$ 620) after certification, implying an annual recurrent cost&#13;
implication attributable to the overall govemment program (to be assisted by TESC) of about 50,000,000 MK or US$3.3&#13;
million. However, these costs will only come on stream in 1998 when the first teachers start getting certified.&#13;

- 17-&#13;
require a share of over 30% of the Government's recurrent budget to provide education of reasonable&#13;
quality to 80% to 90% of primary school-age children (with a per student expenditure level ranging&#13;
between 300 and 450 MK -- i.e. about 20 to 30 US$). With the difficult economic outlook, the major&#13;
challenge is how to do more with less resources and how to mobilize alternative resources for&#13;
education. In the draft SPFP, the Government plans to institute measures to reduce the financial&#13;
pressure including: increased cost recovery at post-primary education levels; increased community&#13;
involvement which will be a significant part of this project; cost-saving measures such as more&#13;
secondary day schooling (instead of the current predominant practice of boarding) and double-&#13;
shifting; encouragement of the private sector and the choice of least-cost alternatives in project&#13;
design (such as the shell classroom construction design and the teacher training approach developed&#13;
in this project). These measures are aimed at improving the efficiency of expenditures and of&#13;
delivery systems. Meanwhile, some donor financing of recurrent expenditures on an increasing or&#13;
constant basis over the next five years (for example under the proposed IDA Third Education Sector&#13;
operation) will provide short-term relief, help set up these measures, and ensure long-term&#13;
sustainability so that in subsequent operations, such recurrent costs could be financed on a declining&#13;
basis.&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION AND READINESS&#13;
4.1    Project preparation was carried out by Ministry of Education staff, under the guidance of a&#13;
project preparation committee (PPC) set up during the preparation mission for the TESC in February&#13;
1995 and composed of representatives of the various units directly associated with the project as well&#13;
as representatives of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Planning and&#13;
Development. The work of the PPC was financially supported by the ongoing Second Education&#13;
Sector Credit and a Japanese Grant for preparation of the TESC. An advance from the project&#13;
preparation facility (PPF) of about US$1.4 million was also approved to assist specifically with&#13;
preparation activities for the PEP, especially in expanding the piloting of the shell design for&#13;
classroom construction, as well as undertaking some of the preparatory activities for implementing&#13;
the pedagogical support and in-service teacher training program, and providing some teaching and&#13;
learning materials to schools. Several small and well-targeted Bank missions were organized since&#13;
the TESC preparation mission in February 1995 to assist the PPC in its work, including a PEP&#13;
identification mission in May 1995 and a follow-up mission in June/July 1995 to prepare the PEP.&#13;
Close contacts have been maintained throughout with other donors, in particular USAID, ODA,&#13;
KfW, GTZ, UNDP and UNICEF.&#13;
4.2    The Bank has worked with NGOs active in the sector. During the appraisal mission, the&#13;
monthly meeting of the Resident Mission with NGOs for October focused on PEP. At the meeting,&#13;
the NGOs expressed enthusiasm for the project and indicated willingness to participate especially in&#13;
the implementation phase (to assist in community mobilization and in the cladding of shells and to&#13;
bid for contracts to construct classroom shells, clad teacher houses and administration blocks,&#13;
construct pit latrines or boreholes or undertake landscaping and other external work).  The&#13;
Government has shown significant and sustained commitment to the overall integrated sector&#13;
approach and to this fast-track supplement. The Department of Planning and the newly created&#13;
Education Development Management Unit (EDMU) are coordinating the preparation of an action&#13;
plan and performance indicators, an implementation manual, a procurement plan, draft contracts and&#13;
standard bidding documents for major procurement actions. As a condition of Credit Effectiveness,&#13;
the Government will submit an implementation manual to IDA. Meanwhile, during negotiations, the&#13;
Government gave assurances that adequate staff and associated resources would be made available to&#13;
implement both this 'fast-track' operation and the subsequent integrated sector operation.&#13;
B. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION&#13;
4.3    Background: Day-to-day management and implementation of the project will be carried&#13;
out by units of the Ministry of Education, namely the Education Development Management Unit&#13;
(EDMU), the Coordinating Unit for the Primary Education Teacher Development Program and the&#13;
Supplies Unit. The EDMU, recently created and placed under the direct responsibility of the PS to&#13;
manage this fast-track operation, will co-ordinate project activities and deal with administrative,&#13;
procurement, and financial matters, as well as contacts with IDA and inter-agency relations. EDMU&#13;
would also be responsible for the management and coordination of the future TESC and other donor&#13;
projects in the sector. Management of the civil works program and related furniture and equipment&#13;
needs would be delegated to a private and independent construction management organization&#13;
(PICMO) under contract to MOE. The functions, responsibilities and reporting arrangements of&#13;
EDMU and PICMO are briefly described in Annex 4 and articulated in detail in a procedural manual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- '9 -&#13;
developed by MOE with Bank assistance. The provision of learning materials will be handled and&#13;
coordinated by the Supplies Unit of MOE. During appraisal the Govemment gave assurances that it&#13;
will maintain the EDMU with adequate professional and support staff, under terms of reference&#13;
acceptable to IDA, (including a team leader, an architect/implementation specialist, an accountant&#13;
and a public relations officer) and will consult IDA for any changes in EDMU staffing and&#13;
responsibilities. These will all be civil servants since EDMU is directly integrated into MOE's&#13;
structure. In the short-term and for some crucial specialized skills difficult to find in Malawi (like&#13;
the architect), short-term local consultants financed under the project will be recruited (under private&#13;
sector terms). The following paragraphs provide details on the implementation of each component.&#13;
4.4    Implementation of civil works: Civil works will be the joint responsibility of large-scale&#13;
contractors (about 8 procurement packages) and a some smaller contractors and NGOs (about 7&#13;
procurement packages), who will construct the classroom shells (see Annex II for details), the&#13;
auxiliary buildings and the site services, and of the communities who will construct the infill for the&#13;
classrooms. The steps involved in the construction of the primary schools are as follows. First,&#13;
Government has selected all districts in which the new and existing schools will be built or&#13;
expanded. Working with MOE technicians, the communities select and prepare the sites and&#13;
determine the appropriate layout for the proposed facilities, with technical advice on appropriate&#13;
drainage, solar and wind orientations, and with community inputs on issues such as proximity to&#13;
village and location of a future football pitch. Simultaneously, the orientation workshops for district&#13;
officials and community leaders are conducted.  During these sessions, the communities'&#13;
responsibility in preparing the site, completing the infill of the shell classrooms, planting, protecting&#13;
and maintaining the shade tree saplings, and maintaining the completed primary school buildings,&#13;
will be discussed and clarified. Secondly, large and small contracts will be tendered and awarded by&#13;
PICMO through international competitive bidding (ICB) and national competitive bidding (NCB) for&#13;
the provision and erection of classroom shells, as well as shells for teachers houses and&#13;
administration blocks. Other smaller contracts for the construction of bore holes and pit latrines and&#13;
the cladding of teacher houses and administration blocks will be awarded following competitive&#13;
bidding advertised nationally (NCB). Finally, as the classroom shells are completed, the district&#13;
officials, or other appointees will visit the communities to encourage them to complete the infill of&#13;
the classroom shells. NGOs will be prominent in mobilizing community efforts. Community inputs&#13;
will be assured by the provision of cement which is a necessary ingredient in the production of&#13;
hydraform blocks. Most rural Malawian communities lack the financial resources to buy their own&#13;
cement, and requiring them to do so would probably result in failure of the community input. The&#13;
cement, and window and door frames to ensure solidity around breeze blocks, will be included in the&#13;
tender packages for the shells and be delivered by the contractors to the communities when&#13;
delivering their materials for the shells to the construction sites.&#13;
4.5    Construction  Supervision:   A  private and  independent construction  management&#13;
organization (PICMO) will be retained to provide overall supervision of the civil works. PICMO&#13;
will be responsible for supervising all aspects of primary school construction, beginning with site&#13;
layout, foundation work, erection of shells, construction of teachers houses and administration&#13;
blocks, digging of boreholes and excavations for pit latrines, planting and staking of shade trees, and&#13;
preparation of certificates of payment for the contractors. PICMO will take instructions from EDMU&#13;
on scope of work and site selection and will program the construction works, prepare bid packages,&#13;
prepare bid evaluation reports, submit recommendations to Central Tender Board, prepare individual&#13;
contracts, supervise the works in the field, certify the quality and value of work executed, prepare&#13;
disbursement applications, report regularly to EDMU, coordinate borehole, landscaping and material&#13;
delivery activities, maintain project accounts for local payments, certify that works are completed&#13;
and prepare a completion report for each site, and all other administrative tasks pertinent to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20 -&#13;
construction management. The PICMO will consist of a team leader, an engineer, an accountant, a&#13;
chief clerk of works and three additional clerks of works. PICMO will be selected on a competitive&#13;
basis from a short-list of experienced construction management firms.&#13;
4.6   Implementation of the Pedagogical Support and In-service Teacher Training Program:&#13;
The implementation of this program will be underlaken by MOE's newly-established Coordinating&#13;
Unit for the Primary Education TDP (which is integrated in MOE's structure). Key tasks include:&#13;
drafting conditions of service for staff, recruitment procedures, planning in-service workshops,&#13;
selection of in-service training centers, arranging the intended cooperation of lecturers of Primary&#13;
Teacher Training Colleges, and making arrangements for selecting venues for materials distribution&#13;
and meeting places for trainees and tutors. Annex 3f provides further details on how the teacher&#13;
training program will be implemented.&#13;
4.7   Implementation of the Teaching and Learning Materials Component: (i) The Supplies&#13;
Unit (SU), also integrated in MOE's structure, will be responsible for the provision of teaching and&#13;
learning materials and their distribution and management as well as other textbook-related activities.&#13;
Most teaching and learning materials will be purchased through international competitive bidding&#13;
while a small quantity of off-the-shelf items will be purchased through UNICEF's Supply Division&#13;
in Copenhagen (UNIPAC). The SU will hire private transporters to deliver these items directly to&#13;
the schools. In each school, the learning materials will be handed over to the school committee&#13;
headed by the headmaster and including representatives of the teachers, PTAs, and communities.&#13;
Representatives of political parties, labor unions, and NGOs will attend as observers. A secure&#13;
storage room will be constructed in each new school. Donors, NGOs, and local communities will be&#13;
encouraged to construct secure store rooms in existing schools; MASAF funds could also be used&#13;
for this purpose. A guide for the management of textbooks will be prepared and distributed to all the&#13;
primary schools. The SU will set up a computerized procurement and distribution system to keep&#13;
track of stock levels in each primary school; (ii) with assistance from the Coordinating Unit for the&#13;
TDP, MIE will organize seminars to train Primary Education Advisers (PEAs) in the use of&#13;
textbooks. The PEAs, in their turn, will train the headmasters and teachers; (iii) The Center for&#13;
Educational Research and Training (CERT) will evaluate the 63 titles developed under the Second&#13;
Education Sector Credit. It will obtain feedback from PEAs, headmasters, Children (especially those&#13;
in higher grades) and teachers through questionnaires.  It will prepare detailed proposals for&#13;
improving the quality and durability of textbooks and for preparing second editions under the TESC.&#13;
C. PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.8    Evaluation and monitoring of project performance and outcomes would be carried out by the&#13;
implementing units over the life of the project. Key project-related performance as well as some&#13;
sector-wide indicators (inputs, outputs, processes, and outcomes) for which targets were set and&#13;
agreed upon at appraisal, are shown in Annex 9. During negotiations, the Government provided&#13;
assurances that EDMU would organize joint IDA-Government annual reviews, and a mid-term&#13;
review of project implementation (approximately a year and a half following Credit effectiveness),&#13;
the results of which will be incorporated in an action plan, acceptable to IDA, for further&#13;
implementation of the project and to be incorporated into the TESC. Progress reports comparing&#13;
planned and actual project implementation, procurement and disbursements, would be submitted by&#13;
EDMU to IDA by December 31 and June 30 each year. A project launch workshop, including local&#13;
launch workshops in communities where PEP schools will be constructed, would be held in Malawi&#13;
shortly before, or shortly after Credit effectiveness, financed from the project, to acquaint staff of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
beneficiary institutions and community leaders with problems likely to be encountered during project&#13;
implementation. Joint IDA-Government supervision missions would be organized at least twice a&#13;
year. Details of the Bank's supervision and review plans are in Annex 10. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government gave assurances that it will submit an Implementation Completion Report (ICR), in&#13;
accordance with applicable guidelines for preparation of completion reports within four months of&#13;
project completion.&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.9    Planning and Monitoring: Procurement of IDA-financed goods and civil works would be&#13;
carried out in accordance with the Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,&#13;
January, 1995 (GuidelinesJ. Under ICB a margin of preference would be granted in the evaluation&#13;
of bids to locally manufactured goods and civil works bids from domestic contractors in accordance&#13;
with paragraph 2.54 and Appendix 2 to the Guidelines. Procurement arrangements are summarized&#13;
in Table 3. EDMU prepared a procurement plan identifying contract packages, value, procurement&#13;
method, implementation schedule and responsibility for implementation which was reviewed at&#13;
appraisal and found satisfactory. The plan, which would be the basis for project implementation and&#13;
monitoring, would be updated quarterly and included in periodic project progress reports.&#13;
4.10   Civil Works:  IDA would fund construction of approximately 1600 classroom  shells&#13;
(including 96 under the PPF). The procurement will be packaged on a geographical region basis&#13;
where feasible. Individual contracts equal to or greater than US$500,000 up to an aggregate total of&#13;
US$ 4.89 million including contingencies, will be awarded and managed by PICMO on the basis of&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated January, 1995. Meanwhile for a fast start, the construction of&#13;
classroom shells during the first 6 months of project implementation when the EDMU and the&#13;
PICMO are new to the tasks and the procurement packages are of a modest amount, will be procured&#13;
using the faster National Competitive Bidding (NCB), through contracts valued at less than US$&#13;
500,000 each. During the subsequent three 6-month periods, as construction activity gears-up,&#13;
procurement packages will become considerably larger, and ICB will be used in most cases, while&#13;
continuing with NCB and smaller procurement packages for isolated areas in the North where works&#13;
are geographically dispersed and are not likely to be attractive to foreign contractors. Civil works&#13;
contracts for the cladding of teacher houses and administration blocksl1 and the construction of&#13;
boreholes and pit latrines for the approximately 75 new schools (as well as additional pit latrines for&#13;
the expanded schools) as well as landscaping and small external works would be awarded on the&#13;
basis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB). All these NCB procurements for civil works will not&#13;
exceed an aggregate total of US$4.2 million and will be performed in accordance with the Guidelines&#13;
and using procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
4.11   Community Participation in Procurement: PEP has been designed with a high level of&#13;
community participation to enhance project sustainability, encourage community involvement in&#13;
children's education, increase the utilization of local skills and materials, and discourage the use of&#13;
materials harmnful to the environment (the burning of bricks has led to serious deforestation).&#13;
During the recent school mapping, the MOE determined that communities have stock-piled sufficient&#13;
burnt bricks to construct 1600 classrooms. With the introduction of the hydraform block-making&#13;
machine, the MOE hopes to halt the further production of burnt bricks. Community involvement&#13;
1 l For administration blocks and teacher houses, the shell model will also be used (and procured with classrooms following&#13;
ICB and NCB procedures); cladding will be done by small contractors using NCB procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
begins with the proper siting of proposed buildings on land suggested by the community. Limited&#13;
land clearing and leveling (saving existing shade-giving trees) is also done by the community.&#13;
Community inputs continue with the larger task of digging soil and moulding enough soil-cement&#13;
blocks to clad or infill all the shell structures erected by the government through private contractors.&#13;
Cement will be financed under the Credit since it will be an expensive item for the communities.&#13;
Cement is a key ingredient of the hydraform blocks and will be used for mortar, to complete floors&#13;
and to fit windows and doors. Steel door and window frames will also be financed under the Credit&#13;
to ensure solidity around the breeze blocks. All these items will be included in the tender packages&#13;
for the construction of shell classrooms, and be delivered to the communities when the contractors&#13;
bring materials to the school sites. Two MOE-funded hydraform technicians will be present in each&#13;
community to direct the production of the blocks, and then to direct the further task of constructing&#13;
walls for the shell classrooms. Technical assistance by NGOs will be used to enhance the&#13;
community mobilization and training effort.&#13;
4.12   Goods: IDA-financed goods including school furniture, equipment, vehicles, and teaching&#13;
and learning materials would be, to the extent possible grouped in contracts costing US$100,000 or&#13;
more and procured following ICB procedures. Preference of 15% or the applicable customs duty,&#13;
whichever is less, on the C.l.P. price would be used for evaluation purposes only. School furniture&#13;
and teaching and learning materials valued at less than US$ 100,000 per contract and US$1.9 million&#13;
in aggregate would be procured following NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. These items would&#13;
involve limited quantities dispersed geographically and spread over time and unlikely to interest&#13;
foreign bidders. Off-the-shelf and minor items valued at less than US$ 30,000 per contract and US$&#13;
500,000 equivalent in aggregate may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of national&#13;
shopping procedures in accordance with the provisions of 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines. Other off-&#13;
the-shelf and minor items unavailable in Malawi valued at less than US$ 30,000 per contract and&#13;
US$ 200,000 equivalent in aggregate may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
international shopping procedures in accordance with the provisions of 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines.&#13;
Some off-the-shelf teaching and learning materials up to an aggregate total of US$454,000 may be&#13;
procured directly from UNICEF's Supply Division in Copenhagen (UNIPAC) as long as its prices&#13;
remain competitive. These items will be packaged into smaller individual contracts for each of the&#13;
four academic years of project implementation. Competitive prices are expected since UNICEF&#13;
buys in bulk on a competitive basis for several countries and this method of procurement has a solid&#13;
track record.&#13;
4.13   Bidding Documents: Current IDA Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) and sample Letters&#13;
of Invitation (LOI) would be used for ICB procurement and selection of consultants. Standard&#13;
Ministry of Works and Supply procurement documents acceptable to IDA would be used for NCB&#13;
procurement of civil works. EDM[U will prepare and submit for IDA review SBD for NCB&#13;
procurement of goods.&#13;
4.14  Consultants' Services: Consultants' services, valued at about US$2.3 million would be&#13;
procured in accordance with the Guidelines, Use for Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
The World Bank as Executing Agency, August 1981. The main consulting service under PEP will&#13;
involve the contracting-out and supervision of civil works by a private and independent construction&#13;
management organization. Terms of reference, LOI and a short-list of consultants for PICMO were&#13;
agreed during negotiations. Selection of a PICMO acceptable to IDA would be a condition of Board&#13;
Presentation while signing of a contract with the selected PICMO would be a condition of Credit&#13;
Effectiveness.&#13;

4.15    IDA Review: Contracts for civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of US$500,000 or&#13;
more, and for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more, would be subject to&#13;
prior review by IDA in accordance to Appendix I of the Guidelines. The use of the Bank's SBDs for&#13;
ICB is expected to expedite prior review of project procurement documents. As various sections of&#13;
the documents will remain unchanged, IDA review will, in practice, be limited to bid evaluation, bid&#13;
and contract data and other contract-specific information. The first NCB procurement for civil&#13;
works and the first NCB procurement for goods are also subject to prior review by IDA. IDA prior&#13;
review of consulting services would be required for: (i) contracts with an estimated value of&#13;
US$100,000 or more; (ii) contracts with individuals for US$50,000 or more; (iii) all single-source&#13;
selections of consultants; (iv) terms of reference for all contracts regardless of value; (v) critical&#13;
assignments; and (vi) amendments to contracts with consulting firms or individuals that result in&#13;
revised  contract values greater than  US$100,000  and  US$50,000  respectively.   All other&#13;
procurements for civil works, goods and consultant services would be subject to random post-review&#13;
by IDA. EDMU would ensure that all necessary documentation is on file and readily available to&#13;
facilitate post review.&#13;

E. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.16   The project is expected to be completed over a three-year period, with the IDA Credit&#13;
disbursed over three and a half years, according to the categories and percentages shown in Table 6.&#13;
To facilitate disbursements, the Government would open a Special Account (SA) in a commercial&#13;
bank acceptable to IDA in Lilongwe for IDA's share of eligible expenditures managed by the&#13;
EDMU. IDA would provide an initial deposit of US$1,500,000 to IDA's special account to cover&#13;
four months of expenditures. EDMU would be responsible for submitting regular replenishment&#13;
applications with appropriate supporting documents for expenditures. Such applications must be&#13;
submitted monthly but no later than every three months. All applications to withdraw proceeds from&#13;
the Credit will be fully documented, except for (a) expenditures of contracts with an estimated value&#13;
of US$500,000 or less for civil works, and (b)US$100,000 or less for goods, consulting firms,&#13;
training and incremental operating costs, and (c) US$50,000 or less for individual consultants, which&#13;
reimbursement may be made against certified statements of expenditure (SOE). Documentation&#13;
supporting expenditures claimed against SOEs would be retained by EDMU and would be made&#13;
available for Bank staff review and the independent auditors as necessary.&#13;

F. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
4.17   EDMU would be responsible for the project's financial management and would maintain&#13;
consolidated project accounts following a system acceptable to IDA. Audits of project accounts, of&#13;
scope and detail acceptable to IDA, would be done annually by independent auditors, acceptable to&#13;
IDA, and the reports would be submitted within nine months of the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
Disbursements under the SOEs would be audited semi-annually.  During negotiations, the&#13;
Government gave assurances that: (i) annual audit reports, of reasonable scope and detail, will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26-&#13;
submitted to IDA within nine months of the end of the Government's fiscal year; the records and&#13;
accounts for all expenditures made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs) would be&#13;
included in the annual audits; the audit reports would contain a separate opinion by the auditors as to&#13;
whether the SOEs together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation,&#13;
can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals; and (ii) an independent auditor acceptable to&#13;
IDA would be appointed under a multi-year contract. In addition to a financial audit, there will be&#13;
management and technical audits to be undertaken at the end of the first year of the project to test&#13;
whether the proposed project management, design and construction arrangements are being&#13;
undertaken satisfactorily and transparently. If necessary, further audits would be undertaken.&#13;
&#13;

5. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
5.1    Specific Project-related Benefits: These would be widespread. Over the three-year period&#13;
1996/97-1998/1999, the project would increase effective access to education (as distinct from simply&#13;
access to a school)'2 through the construction of classrooms to provide shelter and adequate learning&#13;
conditions for about 100,000 children currently taking their lessons in the open air. Most of these&#13;
classrooms will be built in rural and underserved peri-urban areas. Mutually-reinforcing qualitative&#13;
improvements, in the form of better-trained teachers, an adequate supply of learning material, and&#13;
teacher training in the use of textbooks would improve teaching and learning for all primary school&#13;
children (about 3 million children) and reduce repetition and drop-out rates. The project would&#13;
evaluate titles developed under the Second Education Sector Credit and prepare for second editions&#13;
under the Third Education Sector Credit. The project would also support innovative measures such&#13;
as school-based supervision and the delegation of pedagogical support from the central ministry to&#13;
regional and departmental levels to make the system more responsive to local needs. Local&#13;
communities would be required to participate financially and in kind in primary school construction&#13;
and maintenance, reducing the burden on the Government budget and increasing ownership and&#13;
sustainability. The overall TESC, of which this fast-track operation is a part, would introduce or&#13;
continue to support other innovative measures with potentially significant returns, such as: (i)&#13;
programs to boost girls' participation especially at post-primary education levels; and (ii)&#13;
improvements in students' nutritional status and in environmental and health education.&#13;
5.2    Efficiency Gains from Reduced Repetition and Dropout: PEP and the overall TESC will&#13;
provide benefits through efficiency gains attributable to reductions in repetition rates as illustrated in&#13;
Annex 3c. If average repetition rates drop from the present level of over 15% to 5% over the next&#13;
decade, then all other things being equal efficiency gains will result in a reduction of education's&#13;
annual share of GOM's total recurrent budget by an average of 3 to 4 percentage points. With&#13;
reduced dropout rates, these efficiency gains will be enhanced.&#13;
5.3    Sector-wide Economic Benefits: The benefits of this primary education-focused project&#13;
could also be visualized from the results of cost-benefit calculations undertaken using the Malawi&#13;
1990/91 household survey data. The private rate of return to primary education over no education is&#13;
about 23% and this rises to about 28% if school fees and mandatory uniforms are excluded from the&#13;
calculation of private costs (which include mainly foregone earnings and other direct private costs of&#13;
primary education). The private rate of return to secondary education over primary education is&#13;
about 15%. Similarly, the social rate of return to primary over no education is about 20% and that&#13;
for secondary over primary education is about 14%. Similar high average rates of return to&#13;
education for sixteen sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries are reported in the Bank's 1988 policy&#13;
paper on education in SSA where the social rates of primary over no education, secondary over&#13;
primary education and tertiary over secondary education were 26%, 17% and 13% respectively.13&#13;
Further details on rate of return analyses and other economic analyses are shown in Annex 3a.&#13;
12 A di: tin,.tion needs to be made between access to a school, which has increased for the over one million children who&#13;
recentl t ot into the system (but still take their lessons in the open air guided by untrained teachers with no learning or&#13;
teaching materials) and access to education, with an adequate classroom and an adequate set of other inputs.&#13;
13The slightly lower (social) rates of return to education in Malawi in the early nineties compared to those for these 16 SSA&#13;
countries in the seventies is consistent with the declining pattern of the returns to education over time as reported by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
5.4    No operation is completely free of risk and uncertainty. But it is important to plan and take&#13;
risks into consideration to analyze both the potential seriousness of such risks and to identify what&#13;
actions might be undertaken to reduce risk occurrence or the problems incurred by risk.  The&#13;
following paragraphs show the main categories of risk that PEP faces and identifies actions to reduce&#13;
or counter risk.&#13;
5.5    Capacity Constraints: Firstly, the Government's capacity to expeditiously implement the&#13;
fast-track activities and the overall sector program is not assured. For the civil works components,&#13;
this risk would be addressed by transferring responsibility for implementing construction from the&#13;
MOE to a private independent construction management organization (PICMO) and communities,&#13;
and limiting the Government's role to oversight and quality control. Secondly, the capacity of the&#13;
construction industry to build the large number of schools envisaged under PEP is not assured. To&#13;
deal with this risk, the preparation and appraisal missions assisted the Government assess this&#13;
capacity. It became clear that the traditional way of building (with small contractors, bricks and&#13;
mortar, managed by a distant and bureaucratic PIU) put a serious cap on the number of classrooms&#13;
that could be built in any one year.  This led to the shell classroom  scheme, which has been&#13;
thoroughly discussed and analyzed in Malawi with construction practitioners (architects and&#13;
builders).  The design for the steel shell has been finalized (and a model has been built in&#13;
Kabwabwa). Improvements in some aspects of the design are being explored. Bank experience in&#13;
Ghana has shown that a large construction company was able to erect 2000 classroom shells in 18&#13;
months.  The level of detailed planning and technical support provided through PICMO would&#13;
ensure that the schedule set (involving up to 2000 classrooms plus auxiliary buildings over 2-3 years)&#13;
is manageable and implementable. Advance work on construction has begun unlder the PPF and the&#13;
results are encouraging, with community participation very high and the quality of workmanship of&#13;
good standard.&#13;
5.6    Macroeconomic risks: Firstly, the loss in revenues14 and the rapid increases in education&#13;
expenditures (caused by the massive influx of students and the hiring of teachers) exacerbated an&#13;
already difficult macroeconomic situation. The Government recognizes the macroeconomic risks&#13;
involved in its decision but is committed to human resource development as a means to achieve its&#13;
greater objective of poverty reduction. It has put the emphasis on prudent fiscal management at the&#13;
economy-wide level, and the need for efficiency and financial sustainability measures at the sector&#13;
level. In the Bank's dialogue with GOM, the challenge for fiscal sustainability is under discussion&#13;
within the context of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) coordinated by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. Under the MTEF, appropriate fiscal policies involving expenditure restraint,&#13;
prioritization and revenue mobilization are being explored. At the sectoral level, a simulation model&#13;
for education has been developed to assist MOE to assess the viability of alternative efficiency, cost-&#13;
saving and resource mobilization options (see Annex 3d). Economic growvth should increase in the&#13;
next couple of years. There is a risk, however, that if economic growth is not achieved, poor&#13;
economic performance may make it difficult to achieve sustainability with regard to the recurrent&#13;
Psacharopoulos, G. (1994) Returns to Investment in Education: A Global Update. World Development. Vol. 22, No. 9, pp.&#13;
1325-1343.&#13;
14 Just before the abolition of fees, revenues generated from school fees amounted to about US$1.5 million per annum.&#13;
However, given the high rates or return to investment in primary education, keeping over a million children away from&#13;
primary school because of fees would imply a substantially higher loss in incomes for the economy as a whole from a&#13;
productivity perspective. In addition, there will be losses attributable to the impact of education in general and primary&#13;
education in particular to fertility, nutrition, health, R&amp;D and environmental awareness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29-&#13;
cost implications of the overall education development program. To mitigate this risk, donor&#13;
financing of some recurrent expenditures under TESC for the first five years of the program on a&#13;
constant or increasing basis is being considered. After that, financing on a declining basis is&#13;
envisaged.&#13;
5.7    Risks Associated with New and Innovative Programs and Arrangements: The programs&#13;
proposed under the project, in particular those to strengthen decentralization and enhance school-&#13;
based supervision and in-service teacher training and support, are risky and may not fully reach their&#13;
objectives.  A  new  construction methodology and design and innovative implementation&#13;
arrangements also involve some measure of risk. Risks in these areas are being addressed through&#13;
piloting under the PPF phase and would continue to be addressed during project implementation by&#13;
careful monitoring and annual reviews of progress, with the realistic expectation that these programs&#13;
may need to be fine-tuned as implementation proceeds.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
5.8   The project would have no adverse environmental consequences.  The environmental&#13;
category is C. The 75 new schools (600 classrooms) to be constructed will be small and dispersed in&#13;
rural areas. The rest of the 1,000 classrooms will be expansion of existing schools, with little&#13;
detrimental environmental effects. Use of blocks made with hydraform machines (based on pressure&#13;
on a mixture of soil and cement) and not burned bricks for the in-fills by the communities would&#13;
reduce the need for firewood and would therefore also not be detrimental to the environment. The&#13;
plantiuig of sapling shade trees and landscaping to prevent erosion as well as the building of latrines,&#13;
will have positive effects on the environment.&#13;

6. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND&#13;
RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1    Before negotiations, the Government:&#13;
* Submitted to IDA the list of districts and the number within each district where new schools will&#13;
be constructed and existing schools expanded, selected on the basis of criteria of poverty level,&#13;
enrollment ratios, gender disparities, level of overcrowding of schools and population density&#13;
(para. 3.5).&#13;

classrooms (para. 3.7).&#13;
6.2    During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will:&#13;
* Maintain the EDMU with adequate professional and support staff, under terms of reference&#13;
acceptable to IDA, (including a team leader, an architect/implementation specialist, an&#13;
accountant and a public relations specialist) and obtain prior IDA approval for any changes in&#13;
EDMU staffing and responsibilities (para. 4.2 and para. 4.3);&#13;
X Organize a mid-term review of project implementation, approximately a year and a half&#13;
following Credit effectiveness, the results of which review will be incorporated in an action plan,&#13;

Government's fiscal year, and ensure that the records and accounts for all expenditures made on&#13;
the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs) are included in the annual audit; the audit report&#13;
would contain a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the SOEs together with the&#13;
procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the&#13;
related withdrawals; and appoint an independent auditor acceptable to IDA under a multi-year&#13;
contract (para. 4.17).&#13;

project implementation (para. 4.17).&#13;
6.3    As conditions of Board presentation, the Government has:&#13;
* Selected a private and independent construction management organization (PICMO), acceptable&#13;
to IDA (para. 4.14).&#13;
* Submitted the list of sites selected in consultation with communities where new schools will be&#13;
constructed as well as the names of the existing schools to be expanded, ensuring that these lists&#13;
contain at least 80% of the total number of classrooms to be constructed under the primary&#13;
school construction component of the project (para. 3.5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
* Submitted to IDA a prioritized summary of its policies in the sector as a whole in a manner that&#13;
clearly demonstrates that a critical assessment of trade-offs and policy options has been&#13;
considered to arrive at programs and targets that are affordable and sustainable (para. 2.16).&#13;
6.4    As a condition of Credit Effectiveness, the Govemment will:&#13;
*  Submit to IDA a signed contract with the private and independent construction management&#13;
organization (PICMO), acceptable to IDA (para. 4.14).&#13;

Rates of Return to Investment in Education in Malawi&#13;
Introduction: The costs and benefits of education investments can be analyzed in the same way that&#13;
these are calculated for other types of projects. In education, expenditures occur during project&#13;
implementation, and benefits are expected to accrue over the life-cycle of the graduates.  Our&#13;
computation of the rates of return to investment in education in Malawi has been done to help establish&#13;
education investment priorities at the margin and to perform simulations and sensitivity analyses (such as&#13;
the impact on rates of returns of increased cost recovery at the secondary level). The source of data for&#13;
calculating these rates of return to education is the 1990-1991 Household Expenditure and Small Scale&#13;
Economic Activities (HESSEA) survey. Since the data was surveyed in a two-year period, there are&#13;
discrepancies between surveys: these were adjusted by a deflator which was multiplied by monetary&#13;
variables in the analysis to adjust for the different survey times. The amount deflated in each stratum&#13;
follows. The survey covered 6,000 households and used 27,706 observations.&#13;
Deflators used&#13;
Rural Deflators              Stratum  21 = 1.00&#13;
Stratum  11 = 0.85&#13;
Stratum   I = 1.02&#13;
Urban Deflators              Stratum  23 = 1.83&#13;
Stratum  13 = 1.93&#13;
Stratum   3 = 1.61&#13;
Stratum  24 = 1.65&#13;
Bomas Deflators"             Stratum  22 = 1.74&#13;
Stratum  12 = 1.93&#13;
Stratum   2 = 1.61&#13;
Variables Included: The variables included in the model are: public cost of primary and secondar7&#13;
education, private costs of primary and secondary education, age, education level, wages, and income .&#13;
Universities were not included because of insufficient data on earnings/income level of university&#13;
graduates.&#13;
Public Cost:   Public costs are calculated from previous studies which examine the public expenditure&#13;
of the Malawi Government for primary and secondary education. Public costs are in 1990/1991&#13;
Kwachas. Public costs do not include private fees since these are paid to the government which in turn&#13;
pays for public schooling. Other costs such as pens, books etc. should be included in public costs since&#13;
public costs reflect societies cost for each student in primary, secondary and tertiary levels.&#13;
Public Costs:   Primary Public Cost per Student  =  39 Kwachas per year&#13;
Secondary Public Cost per Student = 287 Kwachas per year&#13;
Private Costs (Primary): Private costs one important in assessing two situations: (i) including school&#13;
fees in primary schooling and the mandatory purchase of uniforms; and (ii) considering the elimination&#13;
l Strata are defined as regions where the survey was conducted. The deflators represent different times within 1990-&#13;
1991 when the survey was conducted.&#13;
2 Bomas are administrative headquarters of a district; these are considered as urban areas. The following are excluded&#13;
from Bomas in the 1990-1991 HESSEA Survey: Blantyre City, Lilongwe City, Zomba Municipality and Mzuzu City.&#13;
3 In rural areas, expenditures were used as a proxy for income.&#13;

of school fees at the primary level and not requiring mandatory uniforms. In this calculation, costs are&#13;
annual primary and secondary spending per student in 1990/1991. The costs of uniforms are spread over&#13;
a two-year period, assuming each student maintains the uniform for those two years before purchasing a&#13;
new uniform. Home economics are priced differently by gender; females in rural and urban areas have&#13;
an additional cost (1.00 and 1.50 respectively). Other material costs (pens, books etc.) are calculated on&#13;
a yearly basis. Private costs were derived from the following data:&#13;

Age and Educational Level: The data set included individuals ranging from 10 years of age to fifty&#13;
years of age; The retirement age is assumed to be 50 years of age. The years of education are assumed&#13;
to be: eight for primary and four for secondary.&#13;

No EducatiQn This refers to individuals who received no formal education from public or privates&#13;
sources. These individuals are technically illiterate. Illiteracy as defined by the United Nations is the&#13;
ability of a person to both read and write a short simple statement4.&#13;
Primary Education: Primary education is set at eight years. Although many individuals take longer than&#13;
eight years to complete primary schooling because of lack of resources or time commitments; eight&#13;
years the government expectation and its policy goal.&#13;
Secondary Education:   Secondary education needs a total of four years; no analysis is performned for&#13;
individuals who have not finished secondary schooling.&#13;
Wages: The earnings profile can be illustrated by various forms of productivity measures. Wages are the&#13;
most typical and classical example of productivity measures. In the HESSEA data set, wages are a&#13;
reliable variable in urban areas.&#13;
Income: Income is another measure of productivity, where wages are less likely to be available. In&#13;
Malawi, 91 percent of the population live in rural areas where the HESSEA wage data may not be as&#13;
accurate.  Studies have used income as a measurement for productivity for various countries.5&#13;
Expenditures as a proxy for income have been used in the past, (Psacharopoulos et. al. 1993) used&#13;
expenditures as a proxy for income in Jamaica and Peru. In some instances income in rural areas can be&#13;
misleading; Using the same methodology as the Malawi Poverty Assessment and the study by&#13;
Psacharopoulos et. al 19936, expenditure where used as a proxy for income in rural areas where income&#13;
figures were not deemed reliable.&#13;
Summary of Results: Results suggest an increase in returns by eliminating primary fees and uniform&#13;
requirements. As the tables indicate, removing primary fees increased the rates of return to investment&#13;
in education from 22.76 to 28.11 in wages, and 21.95 to 28.11 in income. The level of increase, almost&#13;
10 percentage points, is surprising. With the elimination of primary fees in 1994, the private rate of&#13;
return to primary education has increased substantially. This explains in part the huge influx of children&#13;
into the system.&#13;

Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico) incomes were used instead of wages. This method was used because of poor data on wages.&#13;

Poverty Analysis and the Incidence&#13;
of Public Expenditures on Education&#13;
Investments in human capital are essential to the poor. Their participation in economic growth&#13;
and improvements in their standard of living are directly linked to the skills they possess. In Malawi, the&#13;
poor rely on publicly provided education to improve these skills. So, the way in which public education&#13;
spending is distributed across income groups can have a tremendous impact on alleviating poverty as&#13;
well as on decreasing inequalitv. The change in the distribution of education subsidies in Malawi&#13;
between 1990/1 and 1994/5 shows that a highly effective way to increase equity of public spending in&#13;
education is to increase the share of primary education.&#13;
The benefit incidence analysis' that follows provides estimates of per capita subsidies across&#13;
income groups by educational levels for 1990/1 and 1994/5. This analysis brings together information&#13;
on school enrollments and information on per student public subsidies (see Table 1). The progressivity&#13;
in the distribution of education subsidies across income groups is analyzed.&#13;

'The Benefit Incidence Analysis methodology is used for estimating the distribution of public expenditures across&#13;
different demographic groups. The procedure involves allocating per unit public subsidies (such as, per student for the&#13;
education sector), according to individual utilization rates of public services. In this way, the incidence analysis brings together&#13;
two basic types of information. First, government expenditures on each type of public service are the basis for calculating per&#13;
unit subsidies. Second, household surveys provide information on utilization rates (for example. enrollment rates) by&#13;
expenditure group, region and gender. Targeting issues are then analyzed using the pattern of government in-kind subsidies&#13;
received by the different population groups, which is the result of variability in recurrent expenditures and variability in the use&#13;
of services. This analysis measures how well public services are targeted to different groups in the population (such as, the poor,&#13;
particular regions of interest. women)&#13;

On average, primary per capita subsidies2 in current terms for 1990/1 are K6.58 a year, at the&#13;
secondary level they are K2.22 and at the tertiary level Kl.78. The total education subsidy per capita is&#13;
KI0.59 a year. In 1994/5, primary per capita subsidies3 in current terms were on average K61.03 a year;&#13;
at the secondary level they are K7.98 and at the tertiary level K12.64. The total education subsidy per&#13;
capita was K81.65 a year.&#13;
The analysis of primary per capita subsidies a year by income groups indicates that the poorest&#13;
quintile receives a smaller subsidy than the richest quintile in both 1990/1 and 1994/5. Even though per&#13;
capita subsidies at the primary level do not appear to be unevenly distributed in either school year, these&#13;
patterns are a combination of the demographic distribution of primary school-age children across income&#13;
groups in Malawi as well as their enrollment rates in primary schools. In the poorest quintile, the&#13;
population between 6 and 13 years of age represents 29: while in the richest quintile, this age group&#13;
comprises 21 percent of the quintile's population.  If the primary education subsidy were evenly&#13;
distributed across income groups in Malawi, it would have to follow this demographic pattern across&#13;
quintiles.&#13;
At the secondary level, annual per capita education subsidies are more unevenly distributed&#13;
across income groups than at primary. In 1990/1, the poorest quintile received a per capita annual&#13;
secondary subsidy of less than Kl compared with K5.89 for the richest quintile. In 1994/5, per capita&#13;
subsidies are K3.14 and K21.15 respectively.&#13;
At the tertiary level, annual per capita education subsidies are the most unevenly distributed of&#13;
all educational levels. The poorest quintile in 1990/1 received a per capita annual tertiary subsidy of&#13;
KO.1 compared with K6.96 for the richest quintile. In 1994/5 these per capita subsidies are KO.75 and&#13;
K49.35, respectively.&#13;
The combination of primary, secondary and tertiary education subsidies yields all education&#13;
annual subsidies per capita. The poorest quintile in 1990/1 received K6.51 per capita annually in&#13;
education subsidies, of which 85 percent were received through primary education. The richest quintile&#13;
in 1990/1 received K20.27 per capita annually in education subsidies, of which 37 percent were received&#13;
through primary education. In 1994/5, these figures are K56.58 for the poorest quintile, of which 93&#13;
percent is received through primary education; the richest quintile receives K137.09, of which 48 percent&#13;
was through primary education.&#13;
The distribution of public education spending across income groups is shown in Figure I jointly&#13;
with the Lorenz distribution of household expenditures for 1990/1 and 1994/5. The diagonal line -- the&#13;
2 In 1990/1, estimates of per capita education subsidies by level and income group are obtained on the basis of school&#13;
enrollments reported in the HESSEA survey and per student subsidies are obtained from the MOE (1993).&#13;
3In 1994/5 there was no household survey available; information on primary school enrollments across income groups&#13;
is derived from the change in regional enrollments reported by the MOE (1995) and employing the HESSEA survey as baseline.&#13;
Enrollments at the secondary and tertiary levels across income groups were estimated on the basis of the total change in&#13;
enrollments between 1990/1 and 1994/5, from MOE statistics, with an equally distributed increase across all income groups&#13;
employing the HESSEA survey as baseline.&#13;

line of "absolute equality" -- joins the points where the cumulative share of the population equals the&#13;
cumulative share of public education recurrent spending. In 1990/1 public education spending at the&#13;
primary and secondary levels was weakly progressive since their distribution lied in between the&#13;
diagonal line and the Lorenz distribution. In 1994/5, public education spending at the primary level is&#13;
strongly progressive since its distribution lies above the diagonal line while secondary education&#13;
spending remains weakly progressive. Tertiary education spending is as regressively distributed as the&#13;
Lorenz distribution in both years.&#13;

On the aggregate, targeting to the poor of all education public spending improved significantly&#13;
from 1990/1 to 1994/5, mainly as a result of the massive surge in primary enrollments among the poor.&#13;
The share of all education public spending for the poorest quintile increased from 9.8 percent to 16.3&#13;
percent between these years. Although the current distribution of public resources for education is still&#13;
weakly progressive, the surge in primary school participation was achieved in a short period. The current&#13;
challenge is to maintain existing enrollment rates at the primary level while simultaneously improving&#13;
the quality of education.&#13;
The incidence analysis by gender indicates that women in both 1990/1 and 1994/5 received about&#13;
half of the subsidy received by men through all education public spending. Women received K7.8 per&#13;
capita annually in 1990/1 in comparison with K 13.5 for men: in 1994/5 these figures are K63.2 and&#13;
K101.2, respectively. Gender disparities are not as wide at the primary level; wider at the secondary&#13;
level and widest at the tertiary level. At the primary level, the gender difference is around 25 percent&#13;
higher in favor of boys, at the secondary level the subsidy for women is half of that for men: at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Annex 3.b&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
tertiary level the subsidy for men is 6 times as large as that received by women. In addition to overall&#13;
gender disparities across levels of education, the gender gap is widest for the poorest quintile at every&#13;
educational level. At the primary level, boys in the poorest quintile receive a 1.5 times larger subsidy&#13;
than girls; at the secondary level the subsidy for men in the poorest quintile is 5.5 times larger than for&#13;
women: at the tertiary level men receive all the subsidy. The HESSEA survey reported no females&#13;
enrolled.&#13;
Cross-country comparisons of the benefit incidence analysis of public education spending for the&#13;
poorest and richest quintiles among Sub-Saharan African countries indicate that in 1990/1 Malawi had&#13;
the most uneven distribution of education subsidies (see Table 2). This situation improved substantially&#13;
in 1994/5. In Malawi, the poorest quintile in 1994/5 receives 16 percent of all public education&#13;
spending: only 10 percent was received in 1990/1. The share of the richest quintile in 1994/5 is 25&#13;
percent compared to the 38 percent that it received in 1990/1. The change in the distribution of&#13;
education subsidies in Malawi between 1990/1 and 1994/5 shows that an effective way to increase equity&#13;
of public spending in education is to increase the share of primary education. Improvements in the&#13;
distribution of these subsidies are still needed as the share of public resources received by the poorest&#13;
quintile remains smaller than their share of the population.&#13;

Site Selection and Targeting the Poor under PEP&#13;
Transparent criteria were used in the selection of districts and communities to locate the new&#13;
schools and for expansion of existing schools. Poverty levels, average enrollment ratios, gender&#13;
disparities, population density and average student-classroom ratios, were used to rank districts. Before&#13;
appraisal, MOE had undertaken a limited school mapping exercise to gather preliminary data which was&#13;
combined with data from the poverty analysis for ranking districts in the school location exercise. The&#13;
results of this exercise were reviewed during appraisal. An intensive IEC campaign is underway to&#13;
explain the objectives of the PEP and the Government's commitment to the poor through the targeting of&#13;
poor communities and overcrowded schools for PEP activities. The following table show the results of&#13;
the school location exercise.&#13;

Sustainability Analysis and&#13;
Recurrent Cost Implications&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The Education Sector Policy and Investment Framework (PIF) highlights the goals and&#13;
objectives that the Government of Malawi wishes to pursue in the next ten years, and outlines the&#13;
programs and policies that will enable Government to attain these objectives. The ability to implement&#13;
these policies and programs, however, will be constrained by the availability of public finance within the&#13;
country and human resource capacity within the Ministry of Education. This chapter focuses on the first&#13;
of these constraints and the potential effect that limited public resources will have on policy formation.&#13;
This chapter formulates three scenarios, each representing different macroeconomic conditions&#13;
and levels of public enthusiasm and will for education. These scenarios are:&#13;
*  Low Scenario. The macroeconomic environment deteriorates and economic growth stagnates or&#13;
declines. With high inflation, real government expenditure on education cannot be maintained at&#13;
current levels and education policies and programs are cut back.&#13;
*  Medium Scenario. The macroeconomic environment is stable and economic growth rises steadily.&#13;
While education is a high priority of the government, its program of fiscal austerity and increasing&#13;
demands from other sectors, creates a situation where education expenditure rises only gradually.&#13;
Education programs are generally maintained, but prioritization is essential and contributions from&#13;
the private sector and parents must increase.&#13;
*  High Scenario. The macroeconomic environment is stable and economic growth rises steadily.&#13;
Consensus exists within the country, and among top levels of Government, that education should be&#13;
the country's uppermost priority and should receive a steadily increasing share of public expenditure.&#13;
As a result, education programs and policies are expanded significantly.&#13;
The chapter examines how each scenario, representing different levels of resource availability,&#13;
affects the mix of feasible education policies and programs. It is hoped that the chapter can be used by&#13;
MOE to revisit the PIF to ensure that the policies and programs outlined there are consistent and&#13;
sustainable with the level of funding that MOE and MOF Planners predict over 1994/95 to 2009/10.&#13;

Simulation Model&#13;
An education simulation model has been developed, based on the structure and characteristics of&#13;
Malawi's education sector, to project the financial resources required to pursue various objectives and&#13;
implement various education policies and programs. The model's flexibility permits parameters to be&#13;
changed to reflect prevailing situations and alternative scenarios through the period 1994/95 to 2009/10.&#13;
The simulation model consists of four modules:&#13;
I)     Projections of enrollment, by level of education, based on school age population, and drop-out,&#13;
repetition and promotion rates. Using the enrollment projections and desired teacher to pupil ratios, the&#13;
demand for teachers is estimated.&#13;
ii)    Unit costs, by level of education, calculated as the annual average public expenditure per pupil.&#13;
Unit costs are derived for both recurrent and investment expenditure. Initial unit costs are based on the&#13;
reference year 1994/95 and, as different policies and programs are pursued, future unit costs rise or fall&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
iii)    Enrollment projections are combined with unit costs (and unit cost projections) to determine the&#13;
aggregate recurrent and investment expenditures by level of education.&#13;
iv)    The summary of education expenditures is mapped against projections of total government&#13;
expenditure to determine the shares of education expenditure from the total.&#13;
Historical data is used to determine the initial enrollment and unit costs necessary for modules i) and ii)&#13;
and for total government expenditure in module iv). Each of the three scenarios thus begins with the&#13;
same base year data found in 1994/95.&#13;
Three Scenarios: Policy Differences&#13;
The basic assumptions and policy variables that comprise each scenario are spelled out in the attached&#13;
annex. Some policies and programs are identical in each scenario to provide consistency and less noise,&#13;
so that better comparisons of relevant policies can be made. For example, each scenario contains the&#13;
same desired amount of learning materials per student. However, the level of cost sharing between&#13;
government and parents differs. By holding the former constant, one can better compare the effect of&#13;
cost sharing on the education budget. Similarly, each scenario maintains the same primary education&#13;
enrollment. That is, it is assumed that all six year-olds enter primary school and that repetition, drop-out&#13;
and progression rates are the same. As a result, the effect of such variables as teacher to pupil and&#13;
inpector to teacher ratios can be assessed.&#13;
However, aside from this, each scenario pursues policies and programs that are very different. Several&#13;
major policy variables are particularly important in determining the required financing and in&#13;
differentiating the three scenarios from one another, including:&#13;
*  the desired teacher:pupil ratio at primary and secondary levels.  Lower ratios will lead to greater&#13;
numbers of teachers and a significantly higher government wage bill;&#13;

*  the period of certifying the present stock of untrained primary teachers. A shorter period of intensive&#13;
training will require more resources, and will bring forward the time when the newly-trained&#13;
certified teachers will demand an increase in salary;&#13;
* the level of cost sharing for teaching and learning materials. The greater the percentage of material&#13;
costs borne by government, the greater the level of public expenditure on education;&#13;
*  the quantity of additional school facilities (such as, classrooms, teachers' houses, administrative&#13;
blocks, boreholes, resource centers) built by government, and the rate at which these are provided;&#13;
*  the number of additional secondary school places provided under the planning period; and&#13;
*  the expansion of tertiary education and the cost-sharing envisaged.&#13;

Summary of Findings&#13;
Enrollment. From the structure of 1994/95 enrollment and projected levels of repetition, drop-out, and&#13;
progression, the model projects that primary school enrollment will decline slowly in the first ten years&#13;
of the planning period, before rising in later years of the framework (Table 2). This is the result of the&#13;
massive influx in enrollment that occurred when free primary education was introduced in 1994/95. This&#13;
caused large numbers of over-age pupils to drop into the system. As over-age students work their way&#13;
out of the system and repetition rates decrease, total enrollment will fall. In later years, however, these&#13;
factors will be overcome by the growing number of six year-olds entering the system.&#13;

Unlike primary education where enrollment growth is minimal and is held constant in each&#13;
scenario, growth in secondary enrollment is significant and varies in each scenario. In the low scenario,&#13;
total enrollment increases at rate of three percent annually, while in the high scenario, enrollment&#13;
increases at a rate of nearly eight percent annually. However, despite the growing number of secondary&#13;
school places, the transition rate from primary to secondary is steady or falling as a result of the growing&#13;
numbers of primary school leavers following the free primary education policy.&#13;

Education Expenditure&#13;
Results of Low Scenario. The results of the low scenario, where education expenditure is most&#13;
constrained, are shown in Table 3.  A comparison of unit costs (spending per pupil), by level of&#13;
education, indicates that primary unit costs are far lower than other levels of education. But because of&#13;
much larger primary enrollment, expenditures at the primary level are significantly greater than other&#13;
levels, hovering around 70% of total education expenditure. Unit costs of primary education vary little&#13;
throughout the planning period. However, mainly as the result of fluctuations in primary enrollment,&#13;
real primary education expenditure falls nearly 20%  from  1994/95 to 2004/05.  When primary&#13;
enrollment increases again, expenditures increase to earlier levels. Secondary unit costs fall steadily&#13;
throughout the planning period as a result of cost-saving policies necessary under the low scenario.&#13;
Nevertheless, as a result of higher secondary enrollment, secondary expenditures increase. University&#13;
expenditure is held constant throughout the planning period. The mix of policies and programs pursued&#13;
under the low scenario leads to total expenditure increase of 5% at the end of the planning period.&#13;

Medium Scenario. Education expenditure under the medium scenario grows steadily. In primary education, both&#13;
unit costs and primary expenditure increase nearly 30% during the planning period. Secondary unit costs remain&#13;
steady, but increased secondary enrollment leads to a more than doubling of secondary expenditure and a&#13;
rise in the secondary share of total education expenditure. University expenditure remains constant. As&#13;
a result of this mix of policies and programs, total education expenditure increases nearly 40% in real&#13;
terms during the planning period.&#13;

High Scenario. The effect of significantly expanding Malawi's education policies and programs is&#13;
evident in Table 5. Primary education unit costs nearly double between 1994/95 and 2004/05 and, over&#13;
the full planning period, primary expenditure increases more than one and a half times. Secondary&#13;
education also expands greatly. Unit cost increases, combined with significant growth in enrollment,&#13;
lead to a nearly fivefold increase in real secondary expenditure and a more than doubling in education's&#13;
share of total education expenditure. Finally, university expenditure doubles over the planning period.&#13;
As a result of increases in all levels of education, real education expenditure increases 180% over the&#13;
planning period.&#13;

Education Expenditure within the Macroeconomic Framework&#13;
Previous levels of education expenditure were low when compared with many other developing&#13;
countries. Data presented in Table 6 show that education was only 8.7% of government recurrent&#13;
expenditure in 1988/89. Education expenditures have been increasing steadily since, rising to 17.2% of&#13;
total recurrent expenditure in 1993/94 and 4.6% of GDP.&#13;

Efficiency Gains through Reductions in Primary Repetition Rates&#13;
The effect of reductions in primary repetition rates have been calculated in the model. In one&#13;
scenario, repetition rates are constant at 15% throughout the model's timeframe. In a second scenario,&#13;
repetition rates gradually decline. In the base year (1994/95), repetition rates are 15% in standards one&#13;
throught eight but these rates fall gradually over time so that by 1999/2000 they are 10%, 2004/05 they are&#13;
7% and by 2009/10 they are just 5%. The final scenario models repetition rates that fall sharply from 15%&#13;
ion the base year to 5% after the first year period and are constant thereafter. The Table below shows the&#13;
effect of declining repetition rates on overall primary enrollment and share of education recurrent&#13;
expenditure within the overall Govemment budget.&#13;

Advantages And Risks, Model A&#13;
Advantages of Model A&#13;
i. Ensures that school pupils are not without teachers while trainees are on residential courses&#13;
(which take place during holiday period).&#13;
ii. Eliminates social stigma attached to delayed selection to training by taking all temporary&#13;
teachers at once.&#13;
iii. Trainees stay in own district during training, and traveling to residential courses is less costly&#13;
(though perhaps more difficult to manage, given the numbers involved).&#13;
iv. Makes formal provision for training in subsidiary subjects.&#13;
v. Schedules substantial guided practice teaching before certification.&#13;
vi. Second residential phase allows for reinforcement of on-the-job training received.&#13;
vii. Two-year period allows sufficient time to cover content equal to that of the current one-year&#13;
preservice course, and avoids stress and fatigue among trainees.&#13;
viii.Maintains the modest output of PTTCs to cater for part of the attrition rate.&#13;
ix. Provides maximum output (22,000 certificated teachers) in a short time (two years).&#13;
Risks Involved in Model A&#13;
i. The logistics involved in training 22,000 at one time as proposed, may overwhelm the&#13;
managerial capacity of the Ministry of Education.&#13;
ii. The model may overstretch MOE's financial, human and material resources, as well as the&#13;
good will and morale on which the teaching professions' contribution to free primary&#13;
education depend.&#13;
iii. Secondary school teachers have different approaches to primary teaching and learning&#13;
strategies, and need specific training if they are to be effective as tutors for primary trainees.&#13;
iv. Using secondary schools and secondary teachers in training primary teachers may not be&#13;
acceptable to primary school heads, advisers, and teachers.&#13;
v. Training and support staff at all levels will require adequate incentives and motivation for&#13;
additional work during scheduled holidays.&#13;
vi. The formation of cohesive representative teams of trainers (tutors, PEAs, primary and&#13;
secondary teachers) may prove difficult, and the evolution of team spirit at training centers&#13;
elusive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 3.f&#13;

i. Establishing an acceptable and effective monitoring system for a program involving such a&#13;
large number of trainees and other stakeholders may be difficult.&#13;
ii. Potential tensions may be anticipated between teachers trained under different programs&#13;
(MIITEP, the one-year PTTC course, and the forner two-year courses).&#13;
Advantages And Risks Of School-Based Inset Programs&#13;
Advantages of School-Based INSET&#13;
i. Reinforces decentralization of education structures and decision-making.&#13;
ii. Provides opportunities for reviewing and revising content and methodologies of teacher&#13;
preparation programs.&#13;
iii. Emphasizes the practice of teaching rather than pedagogical theory.&#13;
iv. Allows trainee deficiencies to be identified and corrected quickly by appropriate support&#13;
measures (advice, tutorials, workshops).&#13;
v. Contributes to long-term capacity building by empowering heads and teachers, and&#13;
demonstrating a trust in their professionalism, with important implications for morale and&#13;
performance.&#13;
vi. Builds on experience of MASTEP.&#13;
vii. School-based teacher training procedures additionally benefit trained teachers and other&#13;
educational cadres.&#13;
Risks Involved in School-Based INSET&#13;
i. Requires good strategic planning, determined implementation, and rigorous accountability.&#13;
ii. Threatens, because of its complexity, to over-stretch MOE's planning, financial, human and&#13;
material resources, as well as the good will and morale on which the teaching professions'&#13;
contribution to free primary education depend.&#13;
iii. Thoroughgoing decentralization to local levels creates risks that funds will be&#13;
misappropriated and materials misallocated; accountability will be more difficult to monitor.&#13;
iv. May be inhibited by delay in establishing zonal resource centers, planned to be in operation&#13;
by 1997-98, lack of experience in organizing, managing and operating resources centers, and&#13;
their high recurrent and capital costs relative to other program expenditures.&#13;
v. Requires high levels of coordination and collaboration among many stakeholders. This may&#13;
be difficult to achieve, and may involve role conflicts.&#13;

Cost-Effectiveness And Least Cost Analysis&#13;
Of Alternatives During Project Design:&#13;
Choice of Primary School Construction Designs&#13;
1) How the Shell Model was Selected for Primary School Design&#13;
The Primary Education Project (PEP) requires the construction of several thousand high-quality&#13;
low-cost classrooms. Working with the staff of the Blantyre-based Project Implementation Unit, Bank&#13;
staff and consultants assessed the ways used to build classrooms in Malawi.&#13;
A detailed analysis of existing and potential building methods was conducted. The need to find a&#13;
new way of building was largely driven by the slowness of existing methods. The traditional way of&#13;
building, with burnt bricks and mortar, wooden trusses and corrugated steel roofs provided solid, durable&#13;
classrooms. However, these were slow to build, and the capacity to increase the number built each year&#13;
was very limited. This traditional building style was draining Malawi's supply of firewood, (needed in&#13;
large quantities to produce burnt bricks). Finally, the cost of these classrooms had escalated, reflecting&#13;
partly the cost of supporting highly-paid staff, equipment and vehicles at a centrally-located PIU.&#13;
Selecting an Appropriate Design For construction with the usual technologies, and with the PIU as the&#13;
implementation agency, the cost of building a two-classroom block ranges from 120,000 MK ($8,000) to&#13;
200,000 MK ($13,400).&#13;
Lowest-cost classrooms are those built by NGOs at a cost as low as 45,000 MK ($3,000) with&#13;
input from the communities (the villagers themselves). At the high end, are the high-quality classrooms,&#13;
built to government specifications under the management of a Project Implementation Unit which&#13;
oversees construction of projects financed by IDA, ADF and USAID.&#13;
In selecting an appropriate classroom design, the following guidelines were followed:&#13;
Building type must be simple;&#13;
Construction method must be ti-ne-e'ficient;&#13;
Cost must be reasonable since the model will be replicated thousands of times;&#13;
Building must be durable and high-quality to ensure a long life-span; and&#13;
Project implementation must be efficient to facilitate speedy tendering and award of&#13;
contracts for construction of the classrooms and associated works.&#13;
The Shell Model: Because of the serious and immediate need for classrooms, a shell design has been&#13;
selected for the PEP civil works. The Bank's Project Preparation Facility, which is acting as a lead-in to&#13;
the fast-track project, will construct up to 240 classroom shells, along with houses, administration&#13;
blocks, and site services beginning in July 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Annex 3.g&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
The steel shell design has already been piloted in Malawi, initially by UNICEF, and more&#13;
recently under the auspices of the MOE. The Ministry of Works completed designs for additional shell-&#13;
type structures in June 1995 and has begun to construct prototypes. The PPF-funded classrooms, to be&#13;
built beginning in July 1995, will be steel shells. The MOE and the Bank will consider construction of&#13;
alternative shell types if any of the MOW pilots prove to be equal or superior to the steel shell. Any&#13;
alternative shell types will be used only if these prove to be as cost-effective, as quick to construct and as&#13;
durable as the steel shell design.&#13;
A British Council consortium is investigating a variety of building methods for the one hundred&#13;
ODA community schools. The Bank's staff continues to closely liaise with the ODA/British Council to&#13;
ensure that the experience gained by these bodies can be fed into decision-making on civil works for the&#13;
PEP.&#13;
The process of putting up the shell is described in the main body of this SAR. The shell model&#13;
unites high technology and traditional building skills. The shell model implies a natural division of&#13;
inputs to the construction of primary classrooms. By awarding large contracts to the efficient private&#13;
sector, Government will move quickly to construct useable classroom shells throughout the country. By&#13;
using their own abilities and resources, the communities will complete the classroom shells provided by&#13;
Government.&#13;
The matrix on the following page summarizes the justification for the selection of the shell-type&#13;
classroom.&#13;

Uncertainty, Risk and Sensitivity Analyses&#13;
Project preparation and planning cannot avoid uncertainty, no matter how good the planning.&#13;
Unexpected changes can work to the advantage or to the detriment of the project. Nevertheless, it is&#13;
essential  to plan and take uncertainty and risk into consideration to analyze both the potential&#13;
seriousness of such risks and to identify what actions might be undertaken to reduce risk occurrence or&#13;
the problems risk may pose.&#13;
The project faces three main risks. The main risks the project faces are as follows. First, the&#13;
Government's capacity to expeditiously implement the fast-track activities and the overall sector program&#13;
is not assured.  For the civil works components, this risk would be addressed by transferring&#13;
responsibility for implementing construction from the MOE to PICA and communities, and limiting the&#13;
Government's task to overseeing and quality control. Second, the innovative programs proposed under&#13;
the project, in particular those to strengthen decentralized construction and enhanced school-based&#13;
supervision, may not fully reach their objectives. Risks in these areas would be addressed by careful&#13;
monitoring and annual reviews of progress, while recognizing that these programs may need to be&#13;
modified during implementation. Finally, there are macroeconomic risks. If economic growth prospects&#13;
are not achieved, poor economic performance may make it difficult to achieve sustainability with regard&#13;
to financing the necessary recurrent expenditure. To mitigate this risk, some consideration is being given&#13;
under TESC for donor financing of some recurrent costs on a constant or increasing basis for at most five&#13;
years, after which financing on a declining basis is envisaged, leading to entirely national financing in&#13;
the long-run.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis was undertaken  to:  (i) improve the understanding of the nature and&#13;
workings of the project, by seeing more clearly how changes in one thing affect others; (ii) examine&#13;
variation in rate of return results by allowing the testing of changes in key variables; (iii) reduce risks by&#13;
suggesting areas where particular precautions should be taken; and (iv) indicate areas needing more&#13;
investigation to improve knowledge of the values likely to be taken by significant variables, by&#13;
simulating the impact of changes in a particular variable. One sensitivity analysis or quantitative process&#13;
of seeing what change in the value of a dependent variable is consequent on a chosen change or changes&#13;
in the value of one or more of the variables that determines it, was performed under the rate of return&#13;
analyses. When school fees for primary education were removed, private rates of return to primary&#13;
education over no education rose by about five percentage points. When school fees for secondary&#13;
education were increased by 10%, then by 20%, the changes in private rates of return were slight (see&#13;
Annex 3b), pointing to the potential for increased cost recovery at post-primary levels of education.&#13;
Furthermore, social rates of return should even increase as a result of efficiency gains and the fact that&#13;
more public resources may be directed to financing quality-enhancing inputs.&#13;

Education Sector Institutional Planning and Management&#13;
It is generally recognized that institutional planning and management, particularly at the school&#13;
and classroom level, has a strong correlation with instructional quality and hence with student&#13;
achievement. The Ministry of Education, the Bank, and other donors have initiated discussions on&#13;
measures which could contribute to improving management of the sector as a whole as well as at district&#13;
and regional levels. These measures would include:&#13;
i) Strengthening sector planning and management at the central level including (as needed)&#13;
realigning the organizational set-up of the Ministry, and rationalizing the functional&#13;
relationship between the departments and units at Headquarters and those in regional and&#13;
district offices;&#13;
ii) Providing in-service training for headmasters, district and regional administrators in basic&#13;
management skills&#13;
iii) Decentralizing basic teacher support services, especially for the large number of untrained&#13;
teachers who entered the system last year, and providing teacher resource centers and related&#13;
facilities at district and zonal levels.&#13;
EPEP would initiate activities to support these measures, especially in decentralized teacher training and&#13;
support; TESC would then join other donors to follow-up the activities begun under EPEP and complete&#13;
the measures proposed here.&#13;
A preliminary Sector Institutional Assessment (SIA) was conducted earlier this year by Bank&#13;
staff from AFTCB. The review undertook an initial assessment of the structure of the Ministry of&#13;
Education and how it interacts with other line ministries, the private sector and with community&#13;
governing structures. The mission focused particularly on sectoral decentralization and how this process&#13;
is linked to government-wide initiatives towards decentralization.  Three working groups on&#13;
Decentralization, Partnerships for Education Service Delivery, and Institutional Coordination were&#13;
formed to follow-up on the mission's findings and prepare detailed recommendations for improving the&#13;
efficiency and performance of the sector.&#13;

MALAWI&#13;
PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Roles, Responsibilities and Relations among Main Implementing Units&#13;
MOE is currently reviewing its organization in order to facilitate its own commitment to provide&#13;
universal primary school education of good quality. At the same time MOE is expected to meet the very&#13;
high expectations of the population regarding education. A first step has been taken through the creation&#13;
of the Education Development Management Unit (EDMU) within the ministry. This unit will be&#13;
responsible for overall management and coordination of all activities within the PEP project by IDA and&#13;
of parallel projects by other donors. The intention has been to limit the number of permanent staff within&#13;
the unit to only a few key positions and in link efficiently into existing functions within MOE. An&#13;
expanded structure would in future be able to handle larger projects as for example the TESC (Third&#13;
Education Sector Credit). It has been recognized, that in an emergency such as at present it would be&#13;
beneficial to call on skills and efficiency, from the private sector, to complement government staff in&#13;
certain key functions. This strategy could be used as a short term solution or as a long term solution,&#13;
without becoming a permanent mode of operation. This implementation strategy is described in detail in&#13;
the Implementation Manual. The following paragraphs summarize the main tasks, responsibilities and&#13;
relations of the main Implementing Units.&#13;
EDMU: The overall responsibility for management, coordination and implementation of EPEP will be&#13;
handled by EDMU, the Education Development Management Unit within the Ministry of Education.&#13;
The division is headed by a Coordinator, reporting directly to the Principal Secretary. The division has&#13;
only a few permanent staff. It has three key functions in addition to the Coordinator. Two of those,&#13;
namely the Financial Manager and the Public Relations Advisor are both permanent positions, not yet&#13;
filled.   Because of the  urgency  of the  situation  the third  position, the  Implementation&#13;
Specialist/Architect, will be filled immediately by a short-term consultant hired on private sector terms.&#13;
Coordinating Unit for the Primay Education TDP and the Supplies Unit: Implementation of the&#13;
teacher development program will be undertaken by MOE's newly-established Coordinating Unitfor&#13;
the Primary TDP (which is integrated in MOE's structure). Key tasks include: drafting conditions of&#13;
service for staff, writing recruitment procedures, planning in-service workshops, selecting in-service&#13;
training centers, arranging the intended cooperation of PTTC lecturers, and  selecting venues for&#13;
materials distribution and meeting places for trainees and tutors.&#13;
The Supplies Unit (SU), integrated in MOE's structure, will be responsible for providing teaching and&#13;
learning materials, their distribution and management and other textbook-related activities. Most&#13;
teaching and learning materials will be purchased through international competitive bidding, a small&#13;
quantity of off-the-shelf items will be purchased through UNICEF's Supply Division in Copenhagen&#13;
(UJNIPAC). The SU will hire private transporters to deliver these items directly to the schools. In each&#13;
school, the learning materials will be handed over to the school committee headed by the headmaster and&#13;
including representatives of the teachers, PTAs, and communities. Representatives of political parties,&#13;
labor unions, and NGOs will attend as observers. A secure storage room will be constructed in each new&#13;
school. Donors, NGOs, and local communities will be encouraged to construct these secure store rooms&#13;
in existing schools; MASAF funds could be used for this purpose. A guide for the management of&#13;
textbooks will be prepared and distributed to all primary schools. The SU will set up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
a computerized procurement and distribution system to keep track of stock levels in each primary school.&#13;
With assistance from the Coordinating Unit for the TDP, MIE will organize seminars to train Primary&#13;
Education Advisers (PEAs) in the use of textbooks. The PEAs, in their turn, will train teachers in the&#13;
effective use and management of textbooks&#13;
Advisory Board: This is a semi-formal forum, chaired by the PS. The Coordinator of EDMU is the&#13;
secretary. The Board meets monthly. All core members represent different functions within MOE,&#13;
primarily functions dealing with Planninig, Teacher Development and Supply. The Team Leader of&#13;
PICMO should always participate. Board members can vary, according to the stage of the project. The&#13;
Board can at any time call participants from other Ministries involved in the project the (as for example,&#13;
the Ministry of Economical Planning and Development, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Works ).&#13;
Other ministries, dealing with some form of education, such as the Ministry of Youth and Ministry of&#13;
Women, Childrens Affairs, Community Services and Social Affairs ( MOWCASC ) should be&#13;
represented when appropriate. Twice yearly, or more often if needed, the Board will expand to include&#13;
members also from Local Government as well as representatives from the private sector, NGOs, their&#13;
umbrella organization CONGOMA and others. The Board is a body for monitoring, sharing information&#13;
and giving advice&#13;
PICMO: To carry out the substantial civil part of EPEP under fast-track conditions it has been decided&#13;
to engage a Private and Independent Construction Management Organization (PICMO), to handle the&#13;
overall coordination and supervision of implementation. A very clear distinction has been made between&#13;
the planning and design aspects and the implementation aspects. All inputs regarding types of design,&#13;
scope and locations of projects are given as briefs by the Implementation Specialist/Architect within&#13;
EDMU to PICMO for implementation.&#13;
PICMO shall be an established firm, or a joint venture of established firms, with demonstrated&#13;
experience in similar projects. Experience in Southern Africa region is preferable but not mandatory.&#13;
Joint ventures involving a local firm are encouraged. PICMO will designate a Team Manager who will&#13;
report directly to the Coordinator of EDMU in the Ministry or to his designated representative.&#13;
PICMO will be responsible for:&#13;
taking instructions from EDMU on scope of work, sites, etc&#13;
programming construction works&#13;
preparing bid packages&#13;
prepare bid evaluation reports&#13;
submitting recommendations to the Central Tender Board&#13;
preparing individual contracts&#13;
supervising works in the field&#13;
certifying the quality and value of work executed&#13;
preparing disbursement applications&#13;
reporting to EDMU on progress, cost, delays, etc&#13;
co-ordinating borehole, landscaping and material delivery activities&#13;
maintaining project accounts for local payments&#13;
certifying that works are completed and preparing a completion report for each site&#13;
generating replenishment applications for the special account&#13;

SCOPE&#13;
The Republic of Malawi has requested the International Development Association (IDA) to finance a&#13;
project that will help finance some urgently needed primary school activities within the Government's&#13;
Education Sector Policy and Investment Framework.&#13;
IDA is responding to the pressing demand for classrooms by allocating major portions of the proposed&#13;
project to primary school infrastructure. The project would finance the construction and provision of&#13;
furniture and equipment for 2000 primary classrooms. Of these, 600 will be in 75 new sites (new&#13;
primary schools) mainly in rural areas: the others will be used to expand existing schools with&#13;
overcrowded classrooms. The project would finance the construction of an administration block, two&#13;
teacher houses, two pit latrines and a borehole in each new school. Construction will follow the shell&#13;
model, which, though new to Malawi, has a track record in Africa, notably with the Bank's ongoing&#13;
primary school project in Ghana. The shell model is a low-cost high-quality classroom construction&#13;
design. Ministry of Education (MOE), throughi a private and independent construction management&#13;
organisation, will put up shells (foundation, slabs, steel columns, and roof), which communities will&#13;
complete with in-fills using blocks made with hydrafoam machines or other local materials. This shell&#13;
can be constructed very quickly, permitting school children to move to the shade and sheter of a&#13;
classroom shell, even without the in-fills. District officials will help mobilize the community in&#13;
completing the classroom shells. Orientationi sessions of 2-3 days will be held for key officials from&#13;
each district, with community leaders to instill a sense of community ownership.&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
The Government of Malawi has done much to develop the education system since Malawi gained&#13;
independence in 1964. The World Bank has been active in assisting Malawi's education sector: the first&#13;
project was approved in 1967. Five additional education projects have been completed since then and&#13;
one project is current (the Second Education Sector Project). These projects primarily focused on&#13;
expansion of primary and secondary education, teacher training, strengthening management and&#13;
planning. Although Malawi's education system has benefited considerably from the assistance of the&#13;
Bank and other donors, such support has not produced the desired impact.  A well-thought and&#13;
comprehensive policy has been lacking.&#13;
In 1994, the Bank began to prepare a new operation, the Third Education Sector Credit, which will&#13;
pursue an integrated sector approach (ISA) to support the Government's program for the development&#13;
and improvement of the sector as a whole. Through this approach, IDA will share in financing a time-&#13;
slice of the Government's overall program specified in the Ministry of Education's draft Sector Policy&#13;
Framework Paper (SPFP). Most donors active in the sector support the approach and have already&#13;
committed resources to finance parts of the Government's program.&#13;
During the preparation of the Third Education Sector Credit, the democratically-elected Government&#13;
announced (in June 1994) that all primary school fees would be abolished as of the beginning of the new&#13;
school year in October, 1994. While this decision was consistent with the Government's overall goal of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
poverty reduction through economic growth and investment in human capital, it resulted in an abrupt&#13;
influx of over one million additional students into the primary system and necessitated the hiring of over&#13;
20,000 new teachers. These were mainly recruited from secondary school leavers, who were given only&#13;
a two-and-a-half weeks of 'induction" before being dispatched to schools. Retired teachers were also&#13;
called back to help. Government estimates that about 38,000 additional classrooms will be required to&#13;
accommodate this influx of children. At present classrooms are severely overcrowded and thousands of&#13;
children take their lessons in temporary facilities such as churches, mosques and even under trees. It is&#13;
common to see classes consisting of two or even three hundred children in a small shed. While access to&#13;
education has increased, the quality of education has fallen: many young children have no learning&#13;
materials available and only a few young untrained teachers to guide them. Unless these pressing needs&#13;
are quickly addressed, there is a risk of losing the public's enthusiastic support for primary education.&#13;
Given the urgency of this situation and at the request of the Government, the Bank has agreed to put on&#13;
'fast-track' processing some urgently needed primary school activities of the Third Education Sector&#13;
Credit. These are within the Government's Education Sector Policy and Investment Framework. This&#13;
Fast-Track Primary Education Project (PEP), amounting to approximately $US22.5 million, will have&#13;
three major components: classroom construction, provision of teaching and learning materials, and&#13;
selected activities for strengthening teacher skills. These components are not only urgently needed, but&#13;
are also fast disbursing, well focused and relatively simple to implement, and have significant up-front&#13;
work already done. The Government is highly committed and enthusiastic as shown by the dramatic&#13;
increase in the share of education of its total budget (from about 18% in 1994 to about 24% in 1995 for&#13;
the recurrent budget).&#13;
This project is therefore being developed as a fast-track forerunner to the development of a full-blown&#13;
integrated sector operation aimed at assisting the Government of Malawi to implement a time-slice of its&#13;
ten-year education sector development program. Within this framework, the project will finance key&#13;
elements of the program to provide a rapid response to the current Malawian educational crisis.&#13;
The specific objectives of this fast-track operation are to: (i) ensure that the quantitative gains in&#13;
enrollments obtained with the introduction of free primary education are maintained through the&#13;
retention of newly-enrolled children in the system; and (ii) improve the quality of primary education&#13;
through providing textbooks, training and pedagogical support to untrained teachers.&#13;
FUNCTIONS&#13;
The consulting firm (to be called PICMO--Private and Independent Construction Management&#13;
Organisation) will designate a Team Manager who will report directly to the Team Leader, EDMU, in&#13;
the Ministry of Education, or his designated representative. The Team Manager will be responsible for&#13;
the performance of all members of the consulting firm assigned to this project.&#13;
The team will be based in Lilongwe, Malawi. Extensive travel throughout the country to project sites&#13;
will be required throughout this assignment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

The team will develop a working knowledge of the relevant Malawian laws, the project architectural&#13;
design and construction drawings, the physical sites designated by the EDMU  and the material&#13;
requirements of the community for all the sites.&#13;
Within two weeks of the start date of this assignment, the Team Manger will submit to the Director,&#13;
EDMU, for review and approval: an overall implementation schedule showing the phasing of proposed&#13;
bidding packages, over the 3 year life span of the project ,a detailed construction schedule for a typical&#13;
site ,a bill of materials by site and in aggregate, a procurement plan to facilitate having the required&#13;
materials on-site to permit construction of the infill panels by the community within the above schedule,&#13;
and a PICMO staffing plan including CV's to provide adequate supervision of the work. The Team&#13;
Manager will be responsible for updating these schedules and plans and will have them available as&#13;
required by the Team Leader, EDMU.&#13;
The Team Manager will submit a monthly written progress report to the Team Leader, EDMU. This&#13;
report will detail actual progress against the schedule, proposed schedule changes with appropriate&#13;

MALAWI&#13;
PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Training on the Use of Hydraform Machines&#13;
Held at Nathenje Residential Training Centre&#13;
and Mwatibu full Primary School&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Primary school enrollment has increased tremendously in the past two years as a result of the&#13;
new policy of free primary education. To respond to this development, the rapid construction of a large&#13;
number of classrooms is a priority. This requires the use of a flexible construction technique which can&#13;
be achieved either by adopting modified designs or using alternative materials of low cost but high&#13;
durability. One such material is the Hydraform Pressed Soil-Cement Block.&#13;
These blocks can easily be produced and used for construction without firing. A hydrafrom block&#13;
(+250mmx220mmxl 15mm) weighing +12kg is made from soil mixed with cement in the ratio of 5-10%&#13;
of cement by weight and mixed with water to attain an optimum moisture content for maximum&#13;
compactive effort. This mix is compressed by a hydraulic unit which molds the interlocking shape of the&#13;
hydraform block which can be cured for 7 days or be used immediately. Cost savings of up to 50% and&#13;
70% in external and internal walls have been reported and unconfined compressive strength of up to&#13;
1 ON/mm is obtained.&#13;
The use of labor-intensive technique creates room for community participation for men and&#13;
women, especially during preparation of soil and actual construction periods. This is already in line with&#13;
donor community ownership requirements as regards implementation of development programs in&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
Malawi accounts for 5% of energy consumption in fuel wood for the burnt brick industry, but&#13;
clay burnt bricks are produced at the expense of trees and forests which have incurred a 3.5% p.a.&#13;
deforestation rate. Land has been degraded to the point that some effects are being realized. The prices of&#13;
clay burnt brick have since been sky-rocketing as a result of scarce and expensive fire wood for kiln-&#13;
firing, making it extremely difficult for both rural and urban communities at large to but. It is logical that&#13;
technologies that can solve shelter (whether classrooms or houses) problems in Malawi while preserving&#13;
and sustaining the environment should be given the greatest priority.&#13;
The Ministry of Education (MOE) decided to use hydraform blocks for the construction of&#13;
classrooms and supplementary units in primary schools. However the production and use of hydraform&#13;
soil-cement blocks requires a sound technical background and training. Accordingly a training program&#13;
for hydraform block making was designed and conducted with the assistance of World Bank funding as&#13;
part of the Primary Education Emergency Program(PEEP).&#13;

Training Course&#13;
The training was conducted at Nathenje Residential Training Center (NRTC) for the theoretical&#13;
sessions of the course and at Mwatibu full Primary School (MFPS) for the demonstrations and practical&#13;
sessions. The training commenced on 18th August 1995 and ended on 31st August 1995. The training&#13;
was designed and conducted by Dr. M.M. Bizaliele and Mr. G.K. Kululanga.&#13;
The details of the course are shown in table 2. The training was initially conducted in a&#13;
classroom to cover the theoretical components of the course in a participative manner before going to the&#13;
field for demonstrations. Visual aids, manuals, leaflets and course modules were used and given to&#13;
participants to enhance understanding of the subjects covered. Examples and demonstrations were&#13;
conducted. About 60% of the training time was devoted to field work. Because their work will involve&#13;
working with communities in the field-group participation was simulated to reflect conditions likely to&#13;
be experienced in the field.&#13;
After every lesson, the participants were requested to evaluate the day's lesson in terms of&#13;
approach of lecturer, contact with participants, language used, relevance of topic taught, approach taken,&#13;
methods used, use of handouts and clarity of lesson; whether the lesson was too difficult or too simple,&#13;
whether there was enough time available. This helped to modify the subsequent lessons to meet the&#13;
participants needs.&#13;
Control Measures&#13;
At the end of each module, the participants were evaluated to determine the extents to which&#13;
they had understood the lessons individually and as a group through practical and oral exercisers. This&#13;
helped to establish the extent to which specific objectives were fulfilled.&#13;
Observations&#13;
The participants were all keen to learn and understand particular items of the course, the&#13;
candidate who came late lagged behind his fellow participants. The only candidate who could not speak&#13;
English delayed the group because the lessons had to be repeated in Chichewa for his benefit.&#13;
Output of Training Programme&#13;
Important issues related to the technology in soil-cement pressed block making were presented&#13;
and participants have acquired sound skills in quality block production and laying, machine operation&#13;
and maintenance. All the specific objectives listed have been met. The training program is considered a&#13;
good example of staff development.&#13;

PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
Supervision activities under the proposed project would be carried out by the EDNMU under the&#13;
direction of the Team Leader and by the PTDPCU and the Supplies Unit. The supervisory functions&#13;
would include:&#13;
(a)   initial review, recording and forwarding of:&#13;
i. all procurement orders&#13;
ii. all disbursement requests&#13;
iii. special accounts expenditures/reimbursements and statements of expenses;&#13;
(b)    preparation of annual implementation budgets;&#13;
(c)    preparation of bidding and other project contracts documents;&#13;
(d)    preparation of monthly financial statements;&#13;
(e)    preparation of progress reports on all aspects of project implementation;&#13;
(f)    monitoring of key performance indicators to be agreed during negotiations;&#13;
(g)    arranging for the annual audits of project accounts and SOEs; and&#13;
(h)   liaising with IDA supervision mission.&#13;
In addition to field supervision as specified below, IDA staff would spend an estimated 4 staff-&#13;
weeks per annum at headquarters during the early implementation years reviewing and commenting on&#13;
procurement documents and disbursement requests, and a further 3 staff-weeks per annum over the&#13;
course of project execution for reviewing reports and audited accounts and for IDA support for project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
A mid-term review of GOM and IDA would be undertaken around September 1997. The TOR&#13;
would be prepared by IDA and agreed with GOM prior to the review date. The review will assess&#13;
physical, institutional and financial progress of the first 1 1/2 years of project implementation as&#13;
measured against targets that were agreed at negotiations. Based on the reviews, the program will be&#13;
adjusted to be consistent with the targets as revised according to experience gained by the time of the&#13;
mid-term review.&#13;

PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Procurement Packaging and Phasing of Civil Works&#13;
Advance work on design and construction was begun under the PPF. Bids for the first 3 schools&#13;
were openned on October 13, 1995. On October 27, bids on the next batch of 9 complete primary&#13;
schools were openned. For the PEP, the appraisal mission planned for a fast start by packaging the first&#13;
procurement into smaller packages that will be bid under the faster National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB). Most bidders will already be familiar with the construction technique and with the tender&#13;
documents themselves, having placed bids on similar buildings at the PPF stage. During these first 6&#13;
months of the PEP (probably between March and August 1996), when the Education Development&#13;
Management Unit (EDMU) and the Private and Independent Construction Management Organization&#13;
(PICMO) are new to the tasks, the procurement is of a modest amount, and all of it NCB. During the&#13;
subsequent three 6-month periods, the construction activity gears up, procurement packages become&#13;
considerably larger, and ICB is used in most cases, while continuing with NCB and smaller procurement&#13;
packages for isolated areas. During the last 6 months, the proposed procurement tapers off, with a safety&#13;
net period of six months at the end to wrap up any incomplete construction, without having to extend the&#13;
closing date. ICB will be used for about 70% of the civil works, and NCB for about 30%.&#13;
The spreadsheet which follows this page describes the proposed packaging by region and divided&#13;
into 6-month segments. Combinations and division amongst the currently proposed packages are&#13;
encouraged, at the informed discretion of the PICMO.&#13;

PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Further Details on Past Education Projects&#13;
The first Education Project - Cr. 102-MAI, which closed on March, 1980 focused on secondary&#13;
school expansion, primary teacher training, and introduction of technical subjects in secondary schools.&#13;
All objectives, except for the last were achieved.&#13;
The second Education Project (Cr. 590-MAI, closed on June, 1982) was approved in 1975, and&#13;
accomplished its project objectives, namely, primary teacher training and expansion of secondary&#13;
education. But one component, the establishment of 'model' primary schools was not carried out, since&#13;
the necessary community participation was not organized effectively.&#13;
The third Education Project (Cr. 910-MAI, closed on May, 1986), begun in 1979, concentrated&#13;
on the expansion and improvement of primary education and primary teacher training, and the expansion&#13;
of correspondence/distance learning facilities. In addition, the Project endeavored to establish an Institute&#13;
of Education (for teacher upgrading), and to strengthen of educational management and planning. While&#13;
the Project was successful in meeting its objectives, reduction of primary school enrollment disparities&#13;
amongst districts was not achieved.&#13;
The fourth Education Project (1123-MAI, closed on December, 1986), approved in 1981, was&#13;
concurrently carried out with a focus on secondary education expansion, and secondary teacher output at&#13;
the university, both of which objectives were successfully fulfilled. Preparation of a National Education&#13;
Plan and pre-investment studies were undertaken under the Project. In 1983, the fifth Education Project&#13;
(1330-MAI, completed on September, 1990) was approved. This was directed to improvement of&#13;
primary education, expansion of primary teacher training, expansion of regular secondary education as&#13;
well as the Malawi College of Distance Education (MCDE), and increasing the number of trained&#13;
accountants: all of these were achieved. Preparation of a school mapping survey and studies regarding&#13;
delivery and utilization of books were also undertaken.&#13;
The next project, the first Education Sector Credit (1767-MAI, closed on December 1994), was&#13;
approved in 1987. The objectives were; primary school expansion and quality improvement, expansion&#13;
of secondary schools, and institutional development. The Project achieved mixed results. Most of the&#13;
planned primary and secondary school expansion was carried out, with some shortfall. The MOE&#13;
headquarters, and MCDE's organization were significantly strengthened and improved, and the&#13;
Government successfully increased education's budget share beyond the target of 15.5% to 17.5%.&#13;
Teacher upgrading through JC/MCE certification, and the merging of the two national teacher&#13;
examination systems was also carried out, and post-primary cost recovery and university loan schemes&#13;
were initiated.&#13;
But, the upgrading of underqualified teachers (due to logistical problems), and textbook&#13;
provision (due to changes in the curriculum), were not undertake, but were completed in the follow-up&#13;
project. In addition, studies planned under the Project were not satisfactorily done.&#13;
&#13;

Under the first Education Sector Project, it was a major assumption for primary school&#13;
construction work that communities would mold bricks. However, the bricks were often not available or&#13;
not sufficient when needed, and the quality was often sub-standard. There were also varying levels of&#13;
commitment among communities. This resulted in delays and high costs since bricks had to be purchased.&#13;
As a consequence, not all classrooms and teachers' houses were completed, (a drop of 29% from what was&#13;
planned).&#13;
The clear lesson is that the Bank should realistically assess the level of community involvement in&#13;
the designi and implementation of Bank-assisted projects, and accordingly formulate a flexible framework&#13;
for community participation through which awaiting communities' contribution for school construction will&#13;
not cause project delay. Using this experience the EPEP is taking a different approach to community input.&#13;
The project will construct classroom "shells", consisting of a foundation, frame and roof, and the&#13;
communities will provide the in-fills (walls, windows etc.). This has two benefits: first, communities'&#13;
participation will come in after shell completion; thus the shell construction will not be affected by possible&#13;
delays in the response of communities; and secondly, these shells can be used without the in-fills so that&#13;
children who are taking their lessons can immediately use these classroom shells.&#13;

            forerunner to an overall integrated sector operation aimed
            at assisting the government of Malawi implement a time-slice
            of its long term education sector development program. The
            main objectives of the program are to provide access to

            quality and resource use at all levels of education, and
            strengthen planning and management in the sector. The
            specific objectives of this fast-track operation are to: i)
            ensure that quantity gains in enrollments obtained with the
            introduction of free primary education and maintained
            through the retention of newly-enrolled children in the
            system; and ii) improve the quality of primary education
            through providing teaching and learning material, and
            pedagogical support to, and in service training for
