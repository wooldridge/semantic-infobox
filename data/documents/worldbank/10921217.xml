&#13;
The Macroeconomic Management and Policy Division of EDI (EDIMP) conducted a core&#13;
course on Macroeconomic Management: New Methods and Current Policy Issues in Nairobi,&#13;
Kenya from April 20-30, 1998. This was the second session of the course offered in 1998.&#13;
The same course was held earlier in Washington, D.C. The ten-day program was designed to&#13;
provide participants with knowledge in and techniques of macroeconomic analysis of policy&#13;
issues in developing economies. The course focused on recent analytical and&#13;
methodological advances in the area of development macroeconomics, various quantitative&#13;
methods, and discussions of policy issues. Thirty-three participants attended this course,&#13;
consisting primarily of professional macroeconomists from academia, government, and&#13;
multilateral institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The course was evaluated by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) using an end-of-course&#13;
questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by twenty-five respondents, 75.8 percent of&#13;
the total number of participants. There were two sections in the questionnaire. The first&#13;
section asked respondents to rate the extent to which the course met its performance&#13;
objectives. The second section asked the level of respondents knowledge about topics&#13;
covered in the course, before and after completing the course, based on self-assessment. A&#13;
5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1 = minimum to 5 = maximum was used to rate&#13;
respondents rating for each question. Following are some of the major evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The mean scores of all course performance indicators, including course effectiveness,&#13;
        design, and presenters' communication skills, exceeded 3.0, the mid-point of the 5-&#13;
        point scale. Respondents indicated that the course was highly relevant to their current&#13;
        work or functions. Respondents' mean score for this indicator was 4.6 out of 5.0, the&#13;
        highest rating in this evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Results indicated that the course received very high performance ratings in three other&#13;
        areas. Respondents felt that the materials provided in the course were useful, and that&#13;
        the course helped participants find new sources of information for the future work.&#13;
        Overall, respondents felt that the course was a worthwhile use of their time. Over 90&#13;
        percent of respondents' ratings on these three indicators fell between 4.0-5.0. The&#13;
        three mean scores ranged between 4.4 and 4.6 out of 5.0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  On the level of course coverage, respondents' ratings of whether the issues were&#13;
        treated in sufficient depth had a mean score of 3.84 out of 5.0. Respondents were&#13;
        also asked whether the time between topics was effectively balanced. The mean&#13;
        score of the allocation of time on different topics was 3.4 out of 5.0, the lowest rating&#13;
        of the course performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Relatively lower mean scores were observed in the effectiveness of the course in the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 area of understanding policy issues. Respondents mean scores of the indicators that&#13;
 asked the extent to which the course helped them better assess the requirements of&#13;
 different policy alternatives or their consequences were in the 3.5-3.6 range out of 5.0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lPre/post knowledge assessment showed overall positive gains in respondents' level of&#13;
 understanding. Pre-course mean scores of all topics covered in the course were in the&#13;
 rage of 2.5-3.9 out of 5.0. Post-course mean scores increased to the 3.4-4.4 range,&#13;
 indicating that respondents felt they learned from the course and had a better&#13;
 understanding of these topics after the course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe largest percentage gains in the level of respondents understanding were observed&#13;
 on the topics of financial liberalization and sequencing of reforms, vector&#13;
 autoregression (VAR) techniques and application, and exchange rate and currency&#13;
 crises. Post-course mean scores of these topics increased by 30-36 percent. Issues&#13;
 in fiscal policy and monetary policy had the lowest gains, 7-9 percentage changes.&#13;
 Relatively high pre-course ratings on policy issues, 3.6-3.9, suggest that the&#13;
 respondents had a fair understanding of the issues before the course and that the&#13;
 amount of information they gained from the course was limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lInformation obtained from pre/post self-assessment reflects the degree to which&#13;
 respondents believed they understood the topics, but does not measure how much&#13;
 they actually learned. The percentage changes in knowledge levels should be&#13;
 therefore interpreted with caution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lA question of validity in the use of current pre/post learning measures was raised in&#13;
 the evaluation. Post-course knowledge ratings of four respondents were lower than&#13;
 their pre-course ratings, causing negative changes in pre/post comparisons. A&#13;
 possible explanation of this would be that having completed the course, the&#13;
 respondents realized they knew much less than they thought they knew, thereby&#13;
 rating lower scales. This indicator may need to be reviewed so that respondents can&#13;
 correctly interpret the question and the indicator captures what it aims to measure,&#13;
 namely, the level of knowledge gains from the course.&#13;
