&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overview&#13;
&#13;
The signing of the Association Agreement with the European Union in June 2014 and the&#13;
coming into effect of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area in September are&#13;
landmark achievements for Georgia. The Association Agreement (AA) is focused on&#13;
improvements in the areas of democracy and the rule of law, human rights, good governance, and&#13;
economic development. The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) is likely to&#13;
enhance Georgia's trade prospects and boost economic growth by enhancing the countryâ&#128;&#153;s export&#13;
potential, especially to developed markets. This will be facilitated through improvements in quality&#13;
standards and by bringing Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s legislation closer to that of the European Union (EU). The&#13;
DCFTA will also remove the existing barriers on the trade of goods and services with the EU. While&#13;
Georgia can now export duty-free to the EU, Georgian products will have to meet certain EU&#13;
requirements not only when exported but also when being consumed within the country. This&#13;
marks the beginning of a long process to improve sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards,&#13;
intellectual property rights protection, competition, technical regulations on industrial products,&#13;
and customs and trade facilitation and this process will involve short- to medium-term costs.&#13;
&#13;
With greater policy certainty, there was an uptick in business and consumer confidence&#13;
leading to an output expansion of 6.0 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2014, up from&#13;
3.2 percent in 2013 as a whole. The position of the ruling Georgia Dream party was further&#13;
strengthened by the absolute majority the party won in the local elections in July 2014. Favorable&#13;
domestic conditions and strong external demand supported economic growth in the first half of this&#13;
year, demonstrating that regional economic tensions have not yet adversely affected Georgia. The&#13;
large Russian market which opened up for Georgian products in July 2013 helped increase exports,&#13;
particularly of wine. Greater consumer and business confidence gave a boost to manufacturing and&#13;
trade. In addition, the construction sector benefited from renewed public infrastructure projects&#13;
and resumption in business related investments. The agricultural sector grew at a relatively modest&#13;
pace compared with industry and services. While growth was generally buoyant in the first half of&#13;
the year, Georgia continues to face downside risks from an escalation of regional tensions and a&#13;
slowdown in the EU. There is also a possibility of counter actions by Russia to limit trade with&#13;
Georgia in light of the signing of the AA.&#13;
&#13;
Buoyant revenue performance limited the fiscal deficit to 1.4 percent of GDP during the first&#13;
6 months of the year. Both current and capital spending picked up during January-June 2014&#13;
compared with the previous year. The prioritization of expenditures in the areas of pensions,&#13;
healthcare and targeted social programs along with an increase in the wage bill raised current&#13;
expenditures by 20 percent in the first half of 2014, year-on-year. Public investment also picked up,&#13;
although, only in the second quarter of 2014. Despite the increase in expenditures, the fiscal deficit&#13;
was contained because of a strong revenue performance. Government revenues in the first half of&#13;
2014 exceeded last yearâ&#128;&#153;s collections by 7.9 percent, year-on-year, driven by VAT and excise duty&#13;
which increased by 30 percent and 15 percent, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
The unemployment rate improved marginally in 2013 to 14.6 percent as a result of declining&#13;
labor force participation. The overall labor force participation rate stood at 66.2 percent in 2013&#13;
and nearly 17,000 people in the working age population decided to opt out of the labor force during&#13;
the year. Both urban and rural unemployment declined, albeit, slightly. Youth unemployment,&#13;
however, increased to 29 percent in 2013, up by 1 percentage point from last year.&#13;

&amp;#12;Georgia: Winds of Optimism&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.      Political Developments&#13;
&#13;
Following a landslide victory in the presidential elections of October 2013, the Georgia&#13;
Dream Party also won a majority in the local elections in July 2014. After the presidential&#13;
elections, Irakli Gharibashvili was appointed the new Prime Minister, and under the new&#13;
constitution that shifted power from the Presidency, he has full executive authority over domestic&#13;
and foreign policy. The Georgia Dream Party further consolidated its position after it won&#13;
convincing victories in the July 12 run-off elections in 8 cities and 12 provincial municipalities,&#13;
gaining control over all the executive branches of local self-governing bodies across the country.&#13;
Despite these wins, a recent public opinion survey conducted by the National Democratic Institute&#13;
shows that the government no longer enjoys the overwhelming support it had compared to&#13;
previous polls. Jobs, poverty and territorial integrity remain the most important public issues and&#13;
the new governmentâ&#128;&#153;s policies have not made a particular dent in any of these areas.&#13;
&#13;
In June 2014, Georgia signed the Association Agreement with the European Union, reaching&#13;
an important milestone under the EU Eastern Partnership Program. The Agreement, which&#13;
includes a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), marks years of cooperation between&#13;
Tbilisi and Brussels under the Eastern Partnership program. It envisages the gradual improvements&#13;
needed in areas such as trade, environment, agriculture, tourism, energy, transport, and education&#13;
to bring Georgia in line with EU standards. Overall, the process is focused on democracy and the&#13;
rule of law, human rights, good governance, and economic development. The DCFTA is likely to&#13;
enhance Georgia's trade prospects and boost economic growth by bringing its legislation closer to&#13;
that of the EU. It will also remove the existing barriers on the trade of goods and services with the&#13;
EU.&#13;
&#13;
The Georgia-EU Association Agreement came into force on September 1, 2014, enabling&#13;
Georgia to export duty-free to the EU. 1 However, certain regulations on Georgian products will&#13;
remain. Certain agricultural and industrial products will be duty free but subject to quotas.&#13;
Moreover, Georgian products will have to meet certain EU requirements not only for export, but&#13;
also when consumed within the country. This marks the beginning of a long process to improve&#13;
sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards, intellectual property rights protection, competition,&#13;
technical regulations on industrial products, and customs and trade facilitation and this process will&#13;
involve short- to medium-term costs.&#13;
&#13;
Despite improvements in the political relations between Georgia and Russia, economic ties&#13;
between the two countries remain fragile. Following the signature of the AA, Russia threatened&#13;
to suspend the free trade agreement with Georgia (in place since February 1994) because Georgia&#13;
is neither a member of the Eurasian Customs Union, nor a part of the Commonwealth of&#13;
Independent States (CIS). This could adversely impact Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s wine exports since Russia is the&#13;
largest market for Georgian wine. While there was no impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on&#13;
Georgia in the first half of 2014, the country could face headwinds from a further escalation of&#13;
tensions in the region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1Under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP+), Georgia already enjoys low or zero tariffs for two-&#13;
thirds of its exports to the EU.&#13;

B.           Recent Economic Developments&#13;
&#13;
Demand and Output&#13;
With greater policy certainty and signing of the Association Agreement, there was an uptick&#13;
in business and consumer confidence leading to an output expansion of 6.0 percent year-on-&#13;
year in the first half of 2014. The position of the ruling Georgia Dream party was further&#13;
strengthened as they won a majority in the local elections in July 2014. Favorable domestic&#13;
conditions and strong external demand, especially from Russia, supported economic growth in the&#13;
first half of this year, demonstrating that regional economic tensions did not adversely affect&#13;
Georgia.&#13;
&#13;
The sectoral decomposition of growth reveals that the expansion was primarily driven by&#13;
manufacturing and construction. These sectors grew by 16.5 percent, 11.1 percent from a year&#13;
earlier. While greater consumer and business confidence gave a boost to manufacturing and trade,&#13;
the construction sector benefited more from renewed public infrastructure projects. Industry grew&#13;
by 9 percent while the services sector, in general, showed robust growth and expanded by 6&#13;
percent, year-on-year. The agricultural sector grew at a relatively modest pace of 1.8 percent after&#13;
expanding by almost 9.7 percent in 2013. Agriculture received a major boost last year from the&#13;
Agriculture Development Fund, which provided farmers with vouchers for buying material and&#13;
equipment and subsidized credit. While these incentives continue, the main impact was felt in 2013&#13;
and this yearâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural growth is likely to be comparatively modest. The only sector to clock a&#13;
decline was mining and quarrying which contracted by 10.6 percent because of declining&#13;
production in the mines since 2013 (Figure 1). A part of the output increase is, however, also&#13;
attributable to the base effect â&#128;&#147; economic growth had moderated to 3.2 percent in 2013.&#13;

The relative contribution of the various sectors to GDP in H1 2014 did not show a marked&#13;
change from 2013. Agriculture lost 0.5 percentage point of its share in total GDP since H1 2014,&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            Recent Economic Developments| 3&#13;

&#13;
the largest change over the last year. On the other hand, construction and financial intermediation&#13;
gained 0.5 and 0.4 percentage points respectively. Growth rate variations in other sectors have not&#13;
markedly changed the overall composition of GDP (Figure 2).&#13;
&#13;
The growth in aggregate demand â&#128;&#147; available only for the first quarter â&#128;&#147; was led by&#13;
investments, particularly, capital expenditure undertaken by the government. Gross fixed&#13;
capital formation increased by 30.8 percent in Q1 2014 (year-on-year) and was led by public&#13;
investments. Greater policy certainty and the low base of 2013 resulted in the significant rise in&#13;
investments. Businesses which had adopted a wait-and-watch approach during 2013 due to&#13;
political uncertainty were reassured with the new government in place and also increased their&#13;
investments. This resulted in a significant rise in the import of capital goods which were mostly&#13;
financed through foreign direct investments and external borrowings. The renewed focus on&#13;
inventory build-up also contributed to GDP growth.&#13;
&#13;
Exports, primarily to Russia, and public consumption also boosted aggregate demand. The&#13;
export of goods and services expanded by 18.2 percent in Q1 2014 compared with the first quarter&#13;
of 2013. The large Russian market was reopened for Georgian exports after Russia lifted its trade&#13;
embargo in mid-2013. This resulted in a significant increase in exports to Russia, mainly of wine&#13;
and mineral water, which continued in the first quarter of this year. The improved political&#13;
environment also boosted private and public consumption which increased by 5.5 percent and 10.8&#13;
percent, respectively, in Q1 2014 (year-on-year). In comparison, government consumption had&#13;
dropped by 10 percent in Q1 2013, year-on-year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Poverty and Unemployment&#13;
&#13;
A micro-decomposition of poverty change using sources of household income confirms the&#13;
importance of social transfers for poverty reduction. Poverty declined to 14.8 percent in 2012&#13;
from 17.7 percent in 2011 while extreme poverty fell from 5.5 percent to 3.7 percent over the same&#13;
period (Figure 3). Universal, non-contributory old age pensions are the largest social assistance&#13;
program covering more than 50 percent of the population. As these pensions are not poverty&#13;
targeted and non-contributory, they do not alter the distribution of consumption as much as they&#13;
help to bring down poverty. The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s well-targeted TSA program has also helped the poor.&#13;
In addition, consumption growth among the bottom 40 percent of the population, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
indicator of shared prosperity, was 5.4 percent during 2010-12, higher than the 3.6 percent growth&#13;
for the population as a whole. Inequality in Georgia is high compared to other countries in the&#13;
region. However, since 2010, there has been a steady, albeit marginal, reduction in the Gini&#13;
coefficient indicating that the poor benefited more from growth in recent years. Inequality stood at&#13;
38.8 percent in 2012 (Figure 4).&#13;
&#13;
Poverty is concentrated in rural areas. In 2012, nearly 66 percent of all poor lived in rural areas. 2&#13;
In addition, about 18.8 percent of rural residents and 10.5 percent of urban residents were poor&#13;
with 5.34 percent of rural residents facing extreme poverty as compared to 1.96 percent of urban&#13;
residents. These patterns represent a notable decline in urban poverty which was as high as 16.6&#13;
percent in 2006. Rural poverty is deeper and more severe than urban poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Nearly all regions in the country registered a decline in poverty levels between 2010 and&#13;
2012 with the exception of Kvemo Kartli. Kakheti stands out as the best performing region with&#13;
poverty falling from 32 percent in 2010 to 20 percent in 2012, such that it is no longer the poorest&#13;
region in the country. In 2012, the regions with highest poverty incidence are Kvemo Kartli and the&#13;
northern mountain arc (Shida Kartli, Mtsheka-Mtianeti, Kakheti). The harsh terrain and physical&#13;
isolation in the northern mountain arc make living conditions extremely difficult in this region&#13;
(2009 Poverty Assessment). The regions with the lowest poverty incidence are Tbilisi and&#13;
Samtskhe-Javakheti.&#13;
&#13;
While internationally comparable poverty indicators for 2013 are yet to be released, the&#13;
national measure indicates a continuation in the trend of falling poverty. The national poverty&#13;
level, measured as the percentage of the population living on an amount that is less than 60 percent&#13;
of median consumption, declined further in 2013.&#13;
&#13;
The unemployment rate improved marginally in 2013 to 14.6 percent as a result of declining&#13;
labor force participation. The overall labor force participation rate stood at 66.2 percent in 2013.&#13;
Nearly 17,048 people in the working age population decided to opt out of the labor force during the&#13;
year. As a result, the rate of unemployment improved by 0.4 percentage point to 14.6 percent.&#13;
&#13;
Both urban and rural unemployment declined in 2013, albeit, slightly. Rural unemployment in&#13;
Georgia has traditionally been low because of self-employment in agriculture which is&#13;
characterized by family-based subsistence farming. In 2013, rural unemployment fell to 6.5 percent&#13;
from 7 percent a year back. A part of this decline in unemployment can be explained by migration&#13;
to urban areasâ&#128;&#147;there was a decline in the rural population by about 40,000 and an increase in&#13;
urban population by about 31,000 dwellers. Urban unemployment is more than four-times rural&#13;
unemployment, primarily because of limited job opportunities in the cities. Urban unemployment&#13;
reduced from 26.2 percent in 2012 to 25.6 percent in 2013, primarily because of a decline in the&#13;
labor force participation rate (Figure 5).&#13;

Youth unemployment increased to 29 percent in 2013, up by 1 percentage point from last&#13;
year. The economic moderation of 2013 appears to have taken a bigger toll on the nationâ&#128;&#153;s youth&#13;
(age 20-29). This cohort is possibly concentrated in the urban areas where unemployment levels&#13;
are high and net job creation is low. The population above the age of 40, on the other hand, saw&#13;
high labor force participation rates and low unemploymentâ&#128;&#147; pointing to the possibility that they are&#13;
clustered in the rural areas (Figure 6).&#13;

Foreign Trade, Balance of Payments and External Debt&#13;
The regional economic tensions had a limited impact on Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s export of goods but&#13;
downside risks remain. With the opening up of the large Russian market in mid-2013, exports to&#13;
Russia continued to grow and increased three-fold in H1 2014 (year-on-year). Goods exports&#13;
reached US$5.4 billion during the first 6 months of 2014 (15.5 percent more than the previous&#13;
year). However, weak growth prospects in Russia will impact Georgian exports over time.&#13;
Simultaneously, the uptick in economic activity increased imports by nearly 16 percent during&#13;
January-June 2014, year-on-year.&#13;
&#13;
The growth in export of goods was driven by black metals, wine and mineral water, and&#13;
manganese ore which rose by 20 percent, 67 percent, and 173 percent, respectively, in H1&#13;
2014, year-on-year. The re-export of used cars, however, fell because of the trade restrictions&#13;
imposed by Armenia and the more stringent requirements on used cars introduced by Azerbaijan&#13;
(Figure 7).&#13;
&#13;
The group of CIS countries continued to be Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s largest trading partner in the first half&#13;
of 2014. However, Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s exports to the EU countries expanded as well, particularly to Bulgaria&#13;
(Figure 8). Like before, Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s main export destinations continued to be Azerbaijan (accounting&#13;
for 20.4 percent of Georgian exports), Armenia (11.0 percent), Russia (9.4 percent), and Turkey (7.9&#13;
percent).&#13;

Import growth, at 16 percent in H1 2014, was spurred by a stronger demand for&#13;
intermediate goods in manufacturing and an increase in investments. The strong performance&#13;
in the manufacturing sector raised the demand for intermediate goods, while the significant&#13;
increase in gross capital formation increased investment related imports. There was, however, no&#13;
change in the composition of imports. The most important commodity groups in Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s imports&#13;
included crude oil and oil products (16.3 percent of total imports), motorcars (10.5 percent),&#13;
mechanical appliances (10.4 percent), electrical equipment (7.6 percent), and pharmaceuticals (4.3&#13;
percent). Majority of the imports were sourced from Turkey (20.5 percent of total imports), China&#13;
(8.7 percent), Azerbaijan (7.3 percent), and Ukraine (6.1 percent).&#13;
&#13;
With a relatively slower growth in the export of services and a rapid increase in imports, the&#13;
trade deficit deteriorated to 17 percent of GDP in Q1 2014, from 14 percent a year ago. The&#13;
trade in services sector, which is dominated by tourism, contracted by 12 percent in Q1 2014, year&#13;
on year (Figure 9). The slower growth was primarily because of a decline in tourist arrivals from&#13;
Turkey and Iran by 15 percent and 42 percent, respectively, and a contraction in the export of&#13;
railway services, particularly to Azerbaijan.&#13;
&#13;
The higher trade deficit and lower transfers widened the current account deficit to 10&#13;
percent of GDP in Q1 2014 compared with 6 percent a year ago. The income account was in&#13;
deficit due to dividends and interest paid out to foreign investors and reinvested earnings. Current&#13;
transfers also recorded a year-on-year decline in Q1 2014 because of a 42 percent reduction in&#13;
official transfers. However, remittances grew to US$358 million in the first quarter of 2014 (8&#13;
percent more than the previous year). While remittances from Russia and Ukraine declined by 5&#13;
and 6 percent, respectively, there was an increase in remittances from Greece, Turkey, Italy and&#13;
Germany. Despite the decline, remittances from Russia represent almost 50 percent of total&#13;
transfers from abroad while Greece is a distant second with 15 percent. 3&#13;

Net inflow of foreign direct investment in the first quarter of 2014, at 3.6 percent of GDP,&#13;
only partially financed the current account deficit during the period. During Q1 2014, net FDI&#13;
inflows grew by 0.6 percent, year-on-year. The main sectors receiving FDI included financial&#13;
intermediation, manufacturing, and transport and communication, and most of it came from the&#13;
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and Azerbaijan (Figure 10). In addition because of&#13;
significant repayment of external debt, international reserves of the National Bank of Georgia&#13;
declined from US$2.8 billion in end-2013 to US$2.6 billion in end-Q1 2014. These debt repayments&#13;
were made by the NBG (about US$40 million), the government (US$50 million), and the private&#13;
sector including banks (US$200 million).&#13;
&#13;
Gross external debt, including inter-company loans, continues to be high and stood at 85.6&#13;
percent of GDP in June 2014. Most of this debt is owed by the private sector with the public sector&#13;
accounting for 23 percent of GDP. A large part of the public sector debt is also concessional and is&#13;
owed to multilateral and bilateral institutions, reducing the risk of external public debt distress.&#13;

&#13;
Fiscal Policy&#13;
&#13;
The fiscal deficit was 1.4 percent of GDP in the first half of 2014 and is expected to widen to&#13;
3.7 percent by the end of the year. Both current and capital spending picked up during January-&#13;
June 2014 compared with the previous year. The prioritization of expenditures in the areas of&#13;
pensions, healthcare and targeted social programs along with an increase in the wage bill raised&#13;
current expenditures by 20 percent in the first half of 2014, year-on-year. The spike in inter-&#13;
governmental fiscal transfers also contributed to this rise. Public investment picked up, although,&#13;
only in the second quarter of 2014. It rose by 35.5 percent compared with the first half of 2013, but&#13;
it represents only a quarter of the annual budgeted public investment expenditures. Despite the&#13;
increase in expenditures, the fiscal deficit was contained because of a strong revenue performance&#13;
in the first half of the year (Figure 11). For 2014 as a whole, the fiscal deficit is expected to widen to&#13;
3.7 percent of GDP. This is because nearly 75 percent of the budgeted capital expenditures will take&#13;
place in the second half of 2014 along with the higher social expenditures.&#13;

Government revenues in the first half of 2014 exceeded last yearâ&#128;&#153;s collections by 7.9 percent,&#13;
year-on-year, driven by VAT and excise duty. Revenue collections were in line with the budgeted&#13;
numbers. Tax revenues were higher by 7.2 percent over the same period and were driven by VAT&#13;
collections which increased by 30 percent and excise duty which rose by 15 percent. VAT also&#13;
accounts for the largest share of tax revenues in Georgia (Figure 12). However, income and profit&#13;
tax collections were lower by 3 percent in the first half of this year. This is primarily because of the&#13;
enactment of the minimum income tax exemption in 2014 which refunded income tax which was&#13;
paid by households with an income below GEL6,000 in 2013. Weaker profitability expectations&#13;

early in the year also resulted in lower advance tax payments by corporates. Non-tax revenues&#13;
accounted for 8.7 percent of the total and exceeded last yearâ&#128;&#153;s collections by lari 43 million.&#13;

The government significantly increased the share of domestic debt in financing the budget&#13;
deficit during the first half of 2014. The volume of T-bills and T-notes issued during January-June&#13;
2014 added GEL330 million to the stock of government securities and were almost fully utilized to&#13;
finance the fiscal deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP. As a result, domestic debt increased by 14.7 percent&#13;
from December 2013 (Figure 13). According to the planned budget, the government will need to&#13;
borrow over 1 billion lari from external sources in the second half of the year to cover the deficit.&#13;

Prices and Monetary Policy&#13;
&#13;
Driven by larger increase in prices for food, the year-on-year inflation reached 3.4 percent in&#13;
August 2014. The price of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 6.4 percent and&#13;
contributed to an increase in price levels by almost 2 percentage points (Figure 14). Within this&#13;
category, the main increases came from vegetables (14.4 percent), fruits and grapes (12.2 percent),&#13;
and milk, cheese and eggs (9.6 percent). There was also an increase in transport prices (2.8&#13;
percent) and tobacco (9.9 percent).&#13;
&#13;
The NBG raised its policy rate by 25 bps to 4 percent in February 2014 over concerns of&#13;
rising inflation. A further increase in inflation was expected because of rising food prices and a&#13;
depreciating lari in late 2013 and early 2014. The policy rate has been maintained at 4 percent&#13;
since February 2014 and inflation has been contained because of a strengthening of the nominal&#13;
effective exchange rate. The year-on-year inflation was 3.4 percent in August 2014, below the target&#13;
of 6 percent. The 2015 inflation target is 5 percent. Monetary policy is geared towards maintaining&#13;
price stability within an inflation targeting framework. However, in the context of a highly&#13;

The introduction of some new financial instruments by the NBG helped reduce loan&#13;
dollarization. It declined by 5.5 percentage points to 59.6 percent on September 1, 2014, but&#13;
deposit dollarization increased by 1 percentage point to 61.8 percent from a year ago. The NBG&#13;
increased the volume of long-term lari-denominated resources through the introduction of various&#13;
instruments such as refinancing loans, deposit certificates, and repo operations. In addition, in&#13;
March 2014, the EBRD issued lari-denominated bonds with a 2-year maturity in the amount of GEL&#13;
50 million.&#13;
&#13;
The new lari-denominated instruments, particularly refinancing by the NBG, boosted lari-&#13;
denominated credit growth. This refinancing by NBG was available for mortgages and SME loans&#13;
and attracted lower interest rates. As an instance, fixed mortgages are offered at 15 percent, while&#13;
the refinanced mortgages are available at about 9-10 percent. As a result, the stock of Lari&#13;
denominated loans issued by the commercial banks expanded by 48 percent, while foreign&#13;
currency loans grew by 10 percent during January-July of 2014. The 12 month moving average of&#13;
weighted interest rates on loans declined from 18.4 percent to 17.1 percent over a year as of July&#13;
2014. The ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) improved from 9.3 percent to 7.4 percent in July&#13;
2014, year-on-year. 5&#13;

Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability&#13;
Economic growth is projected to average 5.5 percent a year over the medium-term based on&#13;
greater policy certainty, improved market access to EU markets, and strong structural&#13;
reform implementation. Medium-term growth prospects factor in improved economic ties with&#13;
the EU and the robust reform program outlined in the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s development strategy, which&#13;
will support growth in private investment. The DCFTA and the Association Agreement with the EU&#13;
will improve market access and encourage FDI. A trade sustainability impact analysis&#13;
commissioned by the EU suggests a potential increase in GDP growth of 4.3 percent in the long-run.&#13;
This will call for labor and capital reallocations to more productive sectors, involving capacity&#13;
building on regulatory approximation particularly in trade facilitation, technical barriers to trade&#13;
and intellectual property rights, and upgrading of and investment in human capital. However, in the&#13;
short-term, this transitional process could involve certain costs as producers upgrade their facilities&#13;
and methodologies to meet the desired quality standards. In recognition of the improved growth&#13;
prospects, Moodyâ&#128;&#153;s Investors Service changed its outlook on Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s Ba3 sovereign rating to&#13;
positive from stable in August 2014. Moody's expects that the DCFTA will attract further FDI and&#13;
bolster the country's export performance, which in turn would support an improvement in&#13;
Georgia's external position over the medium-term. However, downsides from an escalation of&#13;
regional tensions and a slowdown from the EU remain.&#13;
&#13;
While public investment will be maintained over the medium-term, private investment is&#13;
expected to strengthen. Thanks to a better business environment and improved confidence, gross&#13;
investment is likely to increase to an average of 27 percent of GDP a year during 2014-16. Even so,&#13;
this will be lower than the 2004-07 average of 32 percent of GDP a year. The government is&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
committed to leverage more private investment through the PPP framework that is under&#13;
discussion.&#13;
&#13;
Fiscal consolidation is a policy priority for the government, even with a wider deficit in&#13;
2014, and is supported by the IMF program. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 3.7 percent&#13;
of GDP in 2014 with a pick-up in social expenditures and relatively lower revenues due to the&#13;
lagged impact of the growth slowdown in 2013. An increase in capital expenditures and tax refunds&#13;
will also contribute to higher spending. Various measures are under consideration to narrow the&#13;
deficit over the medium-term. These include increased expenditure efficiencies in social benefits,&#13;
reforms in public investment management, the establishment of bonus limitations for public&#13;
employees, and limits on other non-essential expenditures. The level of revenues is consistent with&#13;
the current tax policy framework and is expected to be maintained at about 27 percent of GDP. With&#13;
a planned decline in current expenditures and sustenance of capital expenditures at about 5-6&#13;
percent of GDP, the fiscal deficit is likely to come down to 2.7 percent of GDP by 2016. Fiscal&#13;
consolidation is a key element of the IMFâ&#128;&#153;s Stand-By Arrangement in Georgia. It should be noted&#13;
that the draft medium-term framework of the government (2015-2018) envisages a more&#13;
ambitious fiscal consolidation path with an anticipated deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP by 2018. To&#13;
achieve the desired outcomes, strengthening the effectiveness of social spending and supporting&#13;
the government on developing the institutions and capacity to support program implementation&#13;
will be crucial.&#13;
&#13;
The renewed focus on competitiveness and fiscal consolidation will support external&#13;
sustainability. Higher economic activity and public spending in 2014 will cause the current&#13;
account deficit to increase before improved competitiveness â&#128;&#147; driven by the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
structural reforms, especially in the context of the DCFTA â&#128;&#147; and a narrowing fiscal deficit start&#13;
narrowing the external deficit again. Net FDI is likely to amount to 6.3 percent of GDP on average&#13;
while the national saving rate increases to 20.2 percent of GDP by 2016. Regional uncertainties&#13;
could however dampen Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s export performance and reduce remittances.&#13;
&#13;
Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s public debt remains sustainable. Total public sector debt fell from 38.7 percent of GDP&#13;
in 2010 to 32.2 percent in 2013 due to continued fiscal consolidation efforts. It is estimated to&#13;
increase to 34.5 percent of GDP in 2014 because of the widening of the fiscal deficit. About 80&#13;
percent of public debt in 2013 was external and was dominated by bilateral and multilateral debt.&#13;
Gross external debt, including inter-company loans, continues to be high and is expected to remain&#13;
at more than 80 percent of GDP over the medium-term. The 2014 Debt Sustainability Analysis&#13;
(DSA) by the IMF confirms that debt indicators are within prudential thresholds.&#13;
&#13;
Total external debt is likely to fall from 84 percent in 2014 to about 75 percent in 2019&#13;
because of a narrowing of the twin deficits. While external debt is being closely monitored by the&#13;
authorities, its growth in recent years has mainly been due to commercial borrowings as the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s access to international financial markets has strengthened. Most of this debt is of long-&#13;
term maturity and therefore entails limited rollover risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Structural Reforms and New Initiatives&#13;
&#13;
The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s development strategy 2020 was approved in June 2014 and aims at&#13;
inclusive growth. The strategy is based on four pillars: maintaining macroeconomic stability,&#13;
strengthening competitiveness of the private sector, developing human capital, and enhancing&#13;
access to finance. While the government has initiated a number of reforms towards its strategic&#13;
&#13;
                                                                 Economic and Structural Policies |13&#13;
&amp;#12;Georgia: Winds of Optimism&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
goals, the next step would be to develop an action plan for the systematic implementation of the&#13;
strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Georgia is continuously implementing a number of important reforms in public financial&#13;
management to improve transparency and accountability. Some of the recently introduced&#13;
initiatives include the following: (i) Assessment of fiscal risk associated with the wider public sector&#13;
operations has been initiated along with IMF support; (ii) Preparation is in progress to integrate&#13;
operations of all central and local budgets into the Single Treasury Account (STA); (iii) An action&#13;
plan is under implementation to introduce a single taxpayers account to ensure rapid and accurate&#13;
recording of taxes; (iv) Two new electronic systems were launchedâ&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#156;eDocumentsâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;eHRMSâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#147;in&#13;
the central and local administrations to allow for efficient planning and execution of the budget and&#13;
better management of payroll, pensions, and other money transfers.&#13;
&#13;
The government endorsed the amendments to the tax code in August 2014 to improve the&#13;
business environment and streamline tax administration. The main changes include the&#13;
following: (i) VAT exemption to be introduced for local businesses that serve foreign companies&#13;
operating in the goods processing industry; (ii) Certain long overdue tax arrears and fines to be&#13;
written-off; (iii) Small businesses to be allowed to postpone tax obligations. These amendments aim&#13;
at improving the business environment and streamlining tax administration.&#13;
&#13;
The parliament recently passed a law placing Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s Financial Monitoring Service under&#13;
the prime-Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s office instead of the NBG. The objective of the Financial Monitoring Service&#13;
is to facilitate the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. This step has raised&#13;
some concerns on confidentiality and integrity of financial data, and the government is committed&#13;
to consultation on this issue and to making possible amendments to the law if needed.&#13;
&#13;
The new local self-governance code came into effect in July 2014 with the completion of&#13;
municipal elections. Following local elections, the code, which was approved by the parliament a&#13;
few months back, replaced the law on self-governance. The new code mainly focuses on the&#13;
administrative set-up of the local governments and the division of responsibilities and powers&#13;
between the central and the local authorities. The new code does not significantly change the&#13;
division of expenditures with education and health continuing under the central government. The&#13;
new system for revenue sharing and equalization grants are expected to be developed over time. In&#13;
terms of the administrative set-up, 7 new cities were created taking the total to 12. In addition, the&#13;
new code necessitated the direct election of Mayors by the public.&#13;

Labor Market&#13;
&#13;
Georgia has faced persistent unemployment over the past few years despite a strong growth&#13;
performance. Unemployment affects all Georgians, independent of their standard of living.&#13;
According to the 2013 Welfare Monitoring Survey, 58 percent of the poorest quintile and 30&#13;
percent of the richest quintile reported unemployment of a household member to be the main&#13;
problem facing the household (Figure 17).&#13;

participation. This suggests that policies to lighten womenâ&#128;&#153;s time burden of care responsibilities&#13;
will contribute to raise female labor force participation. In particular, and given the low wages&#13;
prevalent in the labor market, the Government of Georgia should invest in good quality childcare&#13;
provision and pre-school enrollment.&#13;
&#13;
Unemployment results from queuing for good jobs, imperfect information about jobs and&#13;
skill mismatches. Unemployed workers are searching for good jobsâ&#128;&#148;permanent, full time, and&#13;
with opportunities for career developmentâ&#128;&#148;independent of their living standards. In 2012, nearly&#13;
65 percent of the non-poor unemployed were searching for a permanent position and 58 percent&#13;
were searching for a full time one. These figures were even higher among the long term&#13;
unemployed: 70 percent were looking for a permanent position and 66 percent were searching for&#13;
a full time position. This can be suggestive of queuing, which is more prevalent among unemployed&#13;

&#13;
women. 6 Although present, the queuing is less strong among the poor as they have less ability to do&#13;
so given their limited resources.&#13;
&#13;
As a result of queuing and information problems, long term unemployment is high. Nearly 45&#13;
percent of all unemployed were searching for a job for more than one year. In urban areas, this&#13;
figure stood at 50 percent, with more women than men that were long-term unemployed. It was&#13;
found that the problem was even more severe for youth transitioning from school to work, as it&#13;
took school leavers 1.4 years, on average, to find a stable and permanent employment. 7 While&#13;
waiting for the right job, only some youth managed to work temporarily.&#13;
&#13;
Skills are an important determinant of good labor market outcomes. The recent STEP study by&#13;
the World Bank finds strong evidence that non-cognitive skillsâ&#128;&#148;socio-emotional and job-&#13;
relevantâ&#128;&#148;matter for leaving unemployment, accessing good jobs, and maintaining them over time. 8&#13;
Moreover, the study finds that participation in training programs is associated with better skill&#13;
profiles. Therefore, there is a need to put more emphasis on improving the quality of skills&#13;
throughout the education system, on incentivizing workers and firms to raise the levels of on-the-&#13;
job training and other forms of formal accreditation, and in helping the unemployed to acquire&#13;
skills that are in-demand.&#13;

In Georgia, there are no policies to directly help the unemployed to cope with labor market&#13;
shocks and there is limited effort on labor activation. If well designed, an unemployment&#13;
insurance benefit can help households to cope with the loss of a job. However, such a benefit has to&#13;
be designed so as not to aggravate queuing, especially among the non-poor. In parallel, there is a&#13;
need to strengthen active labor market policies to help people in finding jobs, acquiring skills in&#13;
high demand, and gain a better understanding of jobs and skills. All these policies should be&#13;
coordinated among themselves as well as with those devoted to good job creation. It is imperative&#13;
that the government takes a more active role in supporting the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Social Protection&#13;
&#13;
Georgia has one of the highest social assistance expenditures in the Europe and Central Asia&#13;
region. In 2013, social benefits accounted for nearly 6.1% of GDP (Figure 18). Most of the poverty&#13;
reduction seen over the past 2-3 years is attributable to social assistance with the labor market&#13;
playing a relatively limited role.&#13;
&#13;
Social spending increased during 2013 with a full year impact becoming visible in 2014. The&#13;
2013 increases in pension and TSA benefits contributed to the growing social protection&#13;
expenditure (Table 1). According to the 2014 budget law, old age pensions will absorb about 48&#13;
percent of the total social benefit expenditures. The TSA and health protection programs will&#13;
consume about 22 percent each, while the remaining social protection budget will be managed by&#13;
the other line ministries for case-by-case support to their employees or by local municipalities to&#13;
supplement the centralized social assistance programs. The government has prioritized social&#13;
expenditures, although, fiscal pressures demand greater efficiency in these expenditures.&#13;

Old-age pensions, Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s largest category of social spending, play a major role in reducing&#13;
poverty. The existing old-age pension system, which is universal and non-contributory, lowers the&#13;
poverty rate by almost 16 percentage points. However, this flat benefit does not provide adequate&#13;
income replacement for middle- and high-income retirees. The current level of basic pension, set at&#13;
GEL 150 per month, represents a replacement rate of around 20 percent of the average wage, an&#13;
amount that is just below the subsistence level for a working age male (GEL 154). Implementing a&#13;
retirement savings program that complements the public pension system is one of the priorities for&#13;
the country, which is in the pipeline of the government.&#13;
&#13;
The coverage of the TSA program in Georgia is the highest in the ECA region. The TSA is a&#13;
proxy-means tested benefit aimed at providing income support and consumption smoothing among&#13;
the very poor households in Georgia. It consists of GEL 60 monthly as a base transfer plus GEL 48&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             Special Topic: Labor Market and Social Protection| 17&#13;

&#13;
for each additional household member. Launched in July 2006, the program has improved over&#13;
time in its three dimensionsâ&#128;&#148;coverage, generosity and equitability (Figure 19 and 20). For the&#13;
level of poverty of the country, the coverage of the TSA is now among the highest in the ECA region&#13;
(Figure 21). The generosity of the program for the lowest consumption quintile increased from 57.7&#13;
percent in 2009 to 80.8 percent in 2013 while its coverage almost doubled, both for the total&#13;
population (from 8.2 percent in 2009 to 12.6 percent in 2013) and for the bottom 20 percent (from&#13;
16.6 percent to 33.3 percent). In terms of targeting, the percentage of the total TSA benefit received&#13;
by the bottom 20 percent has increased from 39.6 percent to 53.6 percent. While the TSA program&#13;
does a good job of supporting consumption among the extreme poor, more than 40 percent of the&#13;
poorest quintile does not receive TSA and only 8 percent of those receiving transfers receive only&#13;
TSA (Figure 22).&#13;
&#13;
With raised benefit levels, the TSA program might be generating work disincentives for&#13;
women. While the TSA did not discourage beneficiaries from work in 2007 (as reported in the&#13;
World Bank PER of 2012), the expansion of the programâ&#128;&#148;both in terms of coverage and&#13;
generosityâ&#128;&#148;might be responsible for the current work disincentives among women. A recent study&#13;
comparing families around the TSA eligibility threshold finds that single women with children&#13;
between 7 and 17 are more likely to remain inactive if benefiting from TSA. 9 Women who receive&#13;
TSA are 11 percentage points less likely to work (formally or informally) than women who live in&#13;
households that do not receive the transfer. The authors do not find work disincentives among&#13;
mothers of younger children (less than 7), a trend that needs further analysis. There appear to be&#13;
no work disincentives among men.&#13;

In summary&#13;
&#13;
The new government in Georgia has clearly prioritized social expenditures. However, there is a&#13;
need to avoid work disincentives and achieve greater efficiency gains to avoid fiscal pressures in&#13;
the future. In addition, sustained poverty reduction will require greater job creation and&#13;
investments in human capital rather than continual increases in social assistance expenditures.&#13;
