                                          I.Background&#13;
&#13;
 1.     Since 1995, the Borrower has shown sustained commitment to macroeconomic and&#13;
 structural reforms. Moreover, reversals inpolicy actions have beenavoidedprimarily through&#13;
buildingup-front consensus onkeyactions, evenifthis has resultedinsome delay intaking&#13;
 actions. The Borrower underscored its resolve bythe successful completiono f IDA'SSAC 1&#13;
(Cr. No. 2967-TA), for which the ImplementationCompletion Report was completed inJune,&#13;
2001; andprogress to date under the PSACl. Ithas continued to meet program benchmarks&#13;
underthe InternationalMonetaryFund(IMF) supportedEnhanced StructuralAdjustment Facility&#13;
(ESAF)/Poverty Reductionand Growth Facility (PRGF). After successfully implementing&#13;
reforms supported by the last PRGF arrangement, a new three year PRGF arrangementwas&#13;
approved by the IMFBoard inJuly 2003. ReflectingTanzania's improved external position and&#13;
to highlight the authorities' progress toward an exit from the PRGF, access under the new&#13;
arrangement i s only 10 percent o fquota. The new PRGF-supported program focuses on a three-&#13;
pronged strategy aimed at mobilizing revenue, inorder to strengthendomestic savings and&#13;
reduce aid dependency; continuing trade liberalization inorder to enhance efficiency and&#13;
strengthen the tradables sector; and improvingthe economy's supply response byremoving&#13;
impedimentsto growth, includingmeasuresto improvethe efficiency o fthe financial sector and&#13;
promoteprivate sector development. The first review o f Tanzania's new PRGF arrangement was&#13;
completed inFebruary 2004, with a positive assessmento fthe macroeconomic and structural&#13;
benchmarks and approval o f SDR 2.8 million for disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The commitment was further underscored bythe agreement with the Bank and the IMFto&#13;
implement the requirementsstipulated under the Enhanced H P C program. The Borrower&#13;
presentedits InterimPovertyReduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) inMarch2000; the full PRSP in&#13;
November 2000; and Progress Reports on the implementationo f the PRSP inOctober 2001, May&#13;
2003, and April 2004, respectively. InNovember 2001 Tanzania became the fourth country to&#13;
reach the completionpoint under the enhanced framework o f the Heavily IndebtedPoor&#13;
Countries (HIPC) initiative. The first PovertyReduction Support Credit (PRSC 1) for Tanzania&#13;
was approved by the IDA Board on May 29,2003 andthe second PRSC i s expected to be&#13;
presentedto the Board duringthe first quarter ofFY05, following the completiono f all prior&#13;
actions.&#13;
&#13;
3.     Based on the analysis inthe last Country Economic Memorandumfor Tanzania, Tanzania&#13;
at the Turn of the Century: From Reforms to Sustained Growth and Poverty Reduction, a wide&#13;
range o f studies andinvestor roadmaps, and interviews with awide range o f stakeholders, a&#13;
robust consensus exists on the key constraints limitingthe expansion and efficiency o f&#13;
Tanzania's private sector. The policy priorities to address these constraints can be organized&#13;
under the following headings, corresponding to the mainthematic areas covered under the PSAC&#13;
program. These are:&#13;
&#13;
4.     Economic Governance: The focus i s to sustain macroeconomic stability, improve public&#13;
services delivery through improvedmanagement o f the,budget,and lower business costs and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 risks associated with corruption and excessive bureaucracy. The actions focus primarily on&#13;
 reestablishing a credible budget process, inwhich overall fiscal discipline i s accompanied by&#13;
 allocative and operational efficiency, and raising the Borrower's efforts to promote growth and&#13;
 support private sector development.&#13;
&#13;
 5.      Business Environment: The main target i s to remove policy-related and institutional&#13;
 impediments to private investment and efficient business operations. K e y among such&#13;
 impediments are tariff barriers to smooth foreign trade, nuisance taxes at various levels o f&#13;
 government, obstacles to new investment and expansion o f old business, nontax barriersto the&#13;
 intemal and external flow o f goods, bureaucratic red tape faced by investors and exporters,&#13;
nontransparent policies and laws goveming property ownership, constraints to expanding and&#13;
 improving access to financial services, andthe lack o f mechanisms for expeditious settlement o f&#13;
 commercial disputes ina fair and transparent way.&#13;
&#13;
 6.      Privatization and Regulation: Having effectively launchedthe privatization o f its&#13;
 commercial, agricultural, and industrial public enterprises (PES)during 1994-98, Tanzania has&#13;
now embarked on an ambitious and far-reaching program to divest all its major infrastructure&#13;
PESduring2000-04. To provide an effective enabling environment for attracting increased&#13;
private participation inthese key sectors inthe medium-to-long run, Tanzania has embarked on&#13;
the creation o f new sector regulatory laws and independent, cross-sectoral regulatory institutions&#13;
for a competitive regulatory environment. The PSAC program is supporting the establishment o f&#13;
effective infrastructure regulatory capacity and preparation and implementation o f Tanzania's&#13;
privatization program inkey infrastructure, bankingand insurance, and agriculture. Regulatory&#13;
reforms will be sequenced to create procompetitive regulatory environments prior to the&#13;
divestiture o fPESinthe sectors concerned.&#13;
&#13;
7.       The PSAC has been structured to help the Borrower address the constraints identified&#13;
above. It i s based on the Policy Framework Paper, distributed to the Board inJanuary 1999, and&#13;
the Letter o f Development Policy, dated M a y 8, 2000 (LDP), o f the Borrower, which sets out its&#13;
medium term strategy for policy and institutional reforms aimed at supporting private sector&#13;
development inTanzania. This strategy seeks to reduce poverty through accelerating economic&#13;
growth more generally and private sector development more specifically. The principal&#13;
objectives o f the Credit are to encourage increasedprivate investment; induce greater efficiency&#13;
o f the private sector byreducing the cost of doingbusiness and enhanced competition; increase&#13;
private sector participation inthe economy through further divestiture o f keypublic enterprises,&#13;
particularly ininfrastructure services; and improve the effectiveness inthe delivery o f supportive&#13;
public services.&#13;
&#13;
8.      The Credit i s currently supporting the Borrower's efforts to sustain macroeconomic&#13;
stability and improve public service delivery, deepen the implementation o f the privatization&#13;
program, improve competitiveness and the transparency o f key markets, strengthen the state legal&#13;
and commercial apparatus for a more efficient and transparent business environment, and further&#13;
reduce the barriers to intemational and domestic trade. The impact from these actions will&#13;
support accelerated growth inthe medium term by creating conditions conducive to sustained&#13;
private sector development, and spur faster poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 9.      This Credit is to be succeededby a series o fPRSCs for Tanzania, andPRSC-1 was&#13;
 approved by the IDA Board on M a y 29,2003. The objectives o f the PRSC are accelerating and&#13;
 broadening the impact o f growth, aligning public investment with the poverty reduction strategy&#13;
 goals andincreasing the efficiency o fpublic service delivery. It i s based on the PRSP and&#13;
 subsequent Progress Reports on the implementation o f the PRSP, and the Letter o f Development&#13;
 Policy, dated April 10,2003 (LDP), o f the Borrower, which sets out its medium term strategy for&#13;
 policy and institutional reforms aimed at supporting growth and poverty reduction inTanzania.&#13;
 This strategy i s inline with the principal objective o f the World Bank Group's Country&#13;
 Assistance Strategy FYO1-03 for Tanzania (CAS), approved by the Board on June 15,2000.&#13;
 Tanzania i s currently preparing a new PRSP which i s expected to be presented duringthe second&#13;
 quarter o f FY05. A new CAS for Tanzania will be preparedjointly with other donors based on&#13;
 the new PRSP and is expected to be presented to the Board duringthe second half o f FY05.&#13;
&#13;
                                  11. RecentEconomicDevelopments&#13;
&#13;
 10.     Since the mid-l990s, Tanzania has made substantialprogress inmacroeconomic&#13;
 stabilization and structural reforms o f the economy. At the beginning o f the reformprocess,&#13;
 economic growth was slow to pick up, but over the last five years or so it has averaged more than&#13;
 five percent. The positive development continued into 2002 when real GDP grew by about&#13;
 6.3 percent. As a result o f the impact o f the drought on agriculture, real growth in2003 may,&#13;
 however, fall short o f the initiallyprojected 5.5 percent.&#13;
&#13;
 11.     Inflation remainedbelow five percent in2003. Annual inflation declined to 4.4 percent at&#13;
 end-2002 (from 4.9 percent in2001), but increased slightly to 4.8 percent by February 2004, on&#13;
 account o f food shortages. Non-foodprice inflation declined rapidly from a peak o f 9.6 percent&#13;
inJanuary 2003 to 0.6 percent byDecember 2003, as thepass-through ofutilityprice increases&#13;
byparastatals andhigher fuel prices inMay andOctober 2002 evaporated.&#13;
&#13;
 12.    Higher real growth inthe agricultural sector (which accounts for almost half o f GDP) has&#13;
been accomplished through the liberalization o f marketing structures, as well as o f agricultural&#13;
prices and the foreign exchange regime. Fiscal consolidation has been central to the success in&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization. Insupport o f Tanzania's reformprogram, donors have provided&#13;
sizable financial assistance and this has almost eliminated the government's domestic financing&#13;
needs. This has again led to lower interest rates and stimulated private sector growth.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Fiscal developments inFY 2002/03 were characterizedbybetter than projected revenue&#13;
performance, as well as higher-than-expected expenditure. Revenue exceededprojections by 0.3&#13;
percent o f GDP on account o f buoyant revenue from VAT, import duties andnon-tax revenue.&#13;
Total expenditure exceeded projections by 1.2 percent o f GDP, due to higher thanprojected end-&#13;
of-year catch up inrecurrent expenditures and the upward revision o f development expenditures&#13;
financed with foreign grants. Through January o fFY 2003/04, revenue exceeded projections by&#13;
0.2 percent o f GDP, as tax revenue continued to be strong, partlyas a result o f the&#13;
implementation o f measures to curtail smuggling o fpetroleum imports, and the impact o f strong&#13;
collections o f income tax. Duringthe same period, actual expenditure was 0.9 percent o f GDP&#13;
below projections, reflecting lower-than-programmed interest payments, as well as lower-than-&#13;
projected foreign and domestically-financed development expenditure. InFebruary 2004,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Parliament passed a supplementary budgetwhich covers additional drought related expenditures&#13;
 inthe power sector andfor restockingthe strategic grainreserve, butalso for the replacement of&#13;
 a govemment aircraft. The additional expenditure o f about TSH 187billionis to be financed&#13;
 through a combination o f higher than budgeted program support inflows, lower than budgeted&#13;
 debt service payments, as well as additional domestic borrowing from the Bank o f Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
 14.     The discussion o f the macroeconomic framework inthe last PRS Progress Report points&#13;
 out that the continued low revenue yield i s a major challenge for Tanzania. The projected&#13;
 medium-term revenue targets are achievable, with the implementation o f a comprehensive&#13;
 strategy for the reform o f tax administration and policy. Inthis respect, the report notes&#13;
 appropriately the importance o f eliminating exemptions, as well as o f a review o f tax laws. In&#13;
 addition, the organization o f the national tax administration, the strengthening o f the Large&#13;
 Taxpayer Department, and the integration o f the VAT and income tax departments will be o f&#13;
 particular importance.&#13;
&#13;
 15.     Through December 2003, the Bank o f Tanzania (BOT)maintained a tight stance o f&#13;
 monetary policy with a view to meeting the established reserve money targets. Reserve money&#13;
 and net domestic assets o f the BOTremained significantly below the December targets, as the&#13;
BOTmore stringently enforced a standing requirement for commercial banks to transfer to the&#13;
BOTtax revenue heldbythe TRA inbank accounts, and, inaddition, actively engaged inopen&#13;
market operations. As a result o f these actions, money supply growth at end-December remained&#13;
below projections bymore than 4 percentage point. The liquiditysqueeze inSeptember resulted&#13;
insome commercial banks being unableto meet reserve requirements, andledto temporarily&#13;
highinterest rates onthe interbankmarket. InOctober 2003, the liquiditysituation loosenedas a&#13;
result o f the BOT'Sinjection o f liquidity and a drawdown o f deposits bythe government.&#13;
Through December 2003, credit to the private sector increasedby 43 percent, which was&#13;
significantly above projections, fueled inpart byincreasedcompetition inthe bankingsystem,&#13;
and the reduction ininterest rate spreads.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Tanzania's overall balance o f payments position improved in2002/2003 because of larger&#13;
inflows o f donor assistance and the impact o f debt relief under the HlPC Initiative. However, the&#13;
current account deficit, excluding official transfers, widened slightly. There was a strong&#13;
increase innon-traditional exports, mainly gold, combined wjth a moderate improvement in&#13;
traditional exports, reversing a declining trend. Through the first half o f 2003104, balance o f&#13;
payments developments remained inline with projections, as imports, notably petroleum&#13;
imports, accelerated and export growth was inline with expectations. International reserves&#13;
substantially exceeded projections, as scheduled debt-service payments to Japan and Brazil were&#13;
not made and the BOTsold less foreign exchange than anticipated. The exchange rate against the&#13;
U.S.dollar depreciated to T Sh 1110per dollar byend-January, andsince hasremained stable. In&#13;
real effective terms, it depreciated by about 2 percent, which combined with a modest recovery o f&#13;
the terms o f trade, improvedthe environment for exports. The exchange rate is now close to&#13;
what the IMFhas estimated as an equilibrium real exchange.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
 InDecember 2003, government offered49 percent ofthe shares oftheNationalMicrofinance&#13;
 Bank (NMB) for sale to a strategic investor. This will be followedby the sale o f a further 21&#13;
 percent o f shares to domestic investors.&#13;
&#13;
 18.     Having made significant strides inmacro stability, fiscal sustainability and debt&#13;
 management, the Borrower's efforts have refocused on poverty alleviation. A series o f three&#13;
 annual PRS Progress Reports outlines the progress made inimplementingTanzania's poverty&#13;
 reduction strategy duringFYO1, FY02, and FY03. The implementationo f the poverty reduction&#13;
 program focused on initiatives to strengthengrowthprospects, especially inthe pro-poor sectors;&#13;
 develop an effective framework for monitoringpoverty; and elaborate strategies and cost&#13;
 interventions for the key sectors. A comprehensive HouseholdBudget Survey (HBS) was carried&#13;
 out inFYOl and the results were released inApril 2002. Results o f the poverty analysis reflect&#13;
 the decline inbasic needspovertyfrom 38.6 percent inFY92 to 35.4 percent inFYOl. The&#13;
 improvements have beenregistered inthe access to drinkingwater inrural areas, a relatively&#13;
 sharp rise inthe use o fmodem construction materials for housing(urban andrural), and&#13;
 increased access to electricity, market and public transport. The Borrower has set up an&#13;
 institutional framework for povertymonitoring, consistent with the PovertyMonitoring Master&#13;
Plan.&#13;
&#13;
 19.     The budget for FY04 i s inline with commitments made inthe fullPRSP. The budget&#13;
emphasizes Wher increases inpublic spendinginthe priority sectors such as basic health,&#13;
primary education, rural roads, water, agricultural extension and HIV/AIDS. Tanzania has made&#13;
significant progress inthe priority sectors. Ineducation, a basic education sector strategy has&#13;
beenadopted, school fees at the primary levelhave beenabolished and the EducationFundto&#13;
support childrenfrom very poor families has been established. Inhealth, primary health services&#13;
andimmunization coverage have beenexpanded andpublic spendingon healthhas increased&#13;
from US$ 5.50 to US$ 6 per capita. Taxes for drugs to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and&#13;
malaria have beenabolished. Another significant achievement i s the immunization o f 78 percent&#13;
o f children under two years against measles and DPTswith a target to increase and maintain the&#13;
immunization rate at 85 percent. A roads programhas been formulated that gives priority to&#13;
selected areas o fhighpotentialfor poverty impact and to upgradingrural roads inthe 12poorest&#13;
areas. A new agriculture strategy as well as a rural development strategy have beenformulated to&#13;
address complementary problems o f on- and off-farm activities, infrastructure and&#13;
diversification. Inaddition, the borrower has created and made operational the Tanzania Social&#13;
Action Fund(TASAF) aimed at directly boostingcash incomes o fvulnerable groups that are&#13;
involved incarrying out projects chosen and managed by communities.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
*July21,2000 (DCA), state that for the release o f the Privatization and Regulationfloating&#13;
 tranche the following conditions inthe areas o fprivatization andregulation must be fulfilled:&#13;
&#13;
 22.      "The Borrower has: (a) presented to Parliamentfor approval the necessary enabling&#13;
 legislation for the establishment of independent cross-sectoral regulatory institutions covering&#13;
 telecommunication, broadcasting, electricity, water, railways, aviation andportdmaritime&#13;
 sectors, with the objective of establishing a coherent, modern and pro-competition market&#13;
 structures and regulatoryframeworks; and (b) presented to Parliamentfor approval the&#13;
 necessary amendments to current legislation related to the sectors referred to in (a) above with&#13;
 the objective of making such legislation consistent with the enabling legislation referred to in (a)&#13;
 above, asprovidedfor inparagraphs 35, 36 and 37 of the LDP."&#13;
&#13;
 23.     The Borrower has met this condition. The GOT decidedto have four regulatory&#13;
 agencies inthe utility and transport sectors, and enactedtheir respective laws by 2002: the&#13;
 EnergyandWater UtilityRegulatoryAuthority (EWURA),the Surface andMaritime Transport&#13;
 RegulatoryAuthority (SUMATRA), the Communications and Transport RegulatoryAuthority&#13;
 (TCRA), and the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA). The GOT also decided to have&#13;
 Fair Competition Commission (FCC) andFair CompetitionTribunal (FCT), and enactedthe Fair&#13;
 Competition Act inApril 2003. The legislationfor the establishment o f the regulatoryagencies&#13;
 also contains provisions which ensure that current legislationrelated to the respective sectors i s&#13;
 consistent with the enabling legislation.&#13;
&#13;
 24.     "The Borrower has issued technical regulations under the Petroleum Conservation Act&#13;
 of 1981 ensuring the quality and safety ofpetroleum products, in accordance withparagraph 38&#13;
 of the LDP."&#13;
&#13;
 25.    The Borrower has met this condition. The legislation empoweringthe Minister&#13;
responsible for the Energysector to issue technical regulations for a liberalizedpetroleum sector&#13;
was passedbyParliament inApril, 2003; and the Technical Regulations for the sector have&#13;
prepared andprinted. Paragraphs 23 -26 o fthe regulations contain provisions to ensure the&#13;
quality and safety o fpetroleum products. These regulations can only be gazetted to become&#13;
operational once EWURA has beenestablished. Therefore, currently InterimTechnical&#13;
Regulations are inuse.&#13;
&#13;
26.      "The Borrower has approveda strategyfor theprivatization of all Tanzania Harbors&#13;
Authority (THA)services and the sale of non-core assets, with the exception of the Dar es&#13;
Salaam Container Terminal, in accordance withparagraph 40 of the LDP."&#13;
&#13;
27.     The Borrower has met this condition. In1997, the Government approved aport reform&#13;
strategy under which it would retain ownership o f the major port assets through THA acting as a&#13;
landlord, and would involve the private sector inport operations through long term agreements&#13;
such as lease or concession contracts. Inthis context, the Government approved a 10-year lease&#13;
grantedby THA to aprivate sector operator, Tanzania International Container Terminal Services&#13;
(TICTS), to runthe container terminal from September 2000. In2002, PSRC contracted an&#13;
international consultant, RotterdamMaritimeGroup (RMG) o fNetherlands, to assist inassessing&#13;
these privatizationoptions (phase I)  for the remainingactivities, consisting o f four business units:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  7&#13;

 mooring (SBM)unit,and inimplementingthe approved strategy (phase 11). The consultant&#13;
 issuedits final report inJuly 2002, recommending a landlord modelwith concession as the&#13;
 preferreddivestiture option for the first three business units (cargo, oil terminal, marine services),&#13;
 andnegotiations with the current sole user ofthe SBM, i.e. the ZambianRefineryCompany, to&#13;
 manage it. This approach was submitted to Government for approval inSeptember 2002, and&#13;
 Government decided to adopt the proposed landlordmodel inNovember 2003.&#13;
&#13;
 28.     "The Borrower has approved a strategyfor reorganizing TANESCO and restructuring&#13;
 the electricity sector with the objective of introducing competition in the generation and&#13;
 distribution of electricpower, in accordance withparagraph 42 of the LDP."&#13;
&#13;
 29.    The Borrowerhas met this condition. The Government approved the strategy for re-&#13;
 organizing TANESCO and restructuring the electricity sector in 1999 and subsequently&#13;
 consultants were engaged for Restructuring and Trade Arrangements Options studies for&#13;
 TANESCO. The Restructuringand Trade arrangementsreports were completed and submittedin&#13;
 July and April, 2003, respectively. Government has approved a strategy for the restructuring of&#13;
 TANESCO and the reorganization o fthe power sector as follows:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Distribution activities to be split into two areas, one for the northem part o f Tanzania and&#13;
        the other covering the southempart with Dar es Salaam beingdividedbetweenthe two;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Generation activities to be split into two hydrogeneration entities and one thermal with&#13;
        the latter beinghanded over to Songas or decommissioned as appropriate;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Transmission activities to cover the entire mainland as a single entityneutralto the&#13;
        trading arrangements;&#13;
&#13;
    0   One systems operator and market operator to be established at least initially within the&#13;
        nationaltransmission entity but independent interms o f operational decisions and&#13;
        financial issues;&#13;
&#13;
    0   A purchasing agency to beestablished at least initiallyto provide load aggregation service&#13;
        by assisting inthe tendering o f supplyelectricity contract between distributors and&#13;
        generators including imports.&#13;
&#13;
30.     The firmNETGroup Solutions (Pty) from SouthAfrica was recruitedby Government&#13;
through a transparent and competitive process, andtook over the management o f TANESCO&#13;
operations inMay 2002. The Board o f Directors o f TANESCO appointed a monitoring&#13;
consultant to monitor the contract. The management contractor has issued quarterly reports&#13;
which indicatedthat TANESCO continuedto make significant turnaround both financially and&#13;
technically. Since May 2002, collections increased from 76% to 93%, system losses decreased&#13;
from 27% to 24%, administrationand overhead costs were cut down by about 20%, and staff&#13;
numberswere reduced by 1,428 to 4,991 employees. Inview o f intemationalmarket conditions,&#13;
however, and the need for further improvements inTANESCO's operational performance and its&#13;
financial situationbefore successful privatizationwould be feasible, the Govemment has decided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 to extend the performance-based Management Contract for around 3-5 years. The new contract&#13;
 would bebasedon revisedperformance incentives aimed at reducing losses, increasing&#13;
 connections (after the emergencyperiod), investinginsystemrehabilitation, andthe functional&#13;
 unbundling(ring fencing) ofgeneration, transmission anddistribution. A decision onthe timing&#13;
 for launchingprivate participationfor the concessioning o f TANESCO would bebasedon future&#13;
 internationalmarket conditions and completiono fnecessaryreforms.&#13;
&#13;
 31.      "The Borrower has brought TRC's rail services to apoint of concessionAease,in&#13;
 accordance withparagraph 45 of the LDP."&#13;
&#13;
 32.      The Borrowerhas met this condition. The Government of Tanzania advertised the&#13;
 intentionto concession TRC's rail services inDecember 2001 and January 2002 and short listed&#13;
 four rail operators who were issuedwith the biddingdocuments. However, the first tender was&#13;
 unsuccessful, attracting only one qualified bidder who failed to submit a bid. As a result, the&#13;
 Government directed PSRC to restart the process. PSRC selectedatransaction adviser (CPCS&#13;
Transcom o f Canada) through competitionin2003. The pre-qualificationprocess involvedtwo&#13;
rounds o f advertising and resulted inseven applications to pre-qualify inAugust 2003, including&#13;
Canac, Dynamic Rail, East Afnca Rail Consortium, Great Lakes Railway Company Consortium,&#13;
NPLUSpoomet Consortium, RITES Consortium, Sheltam/ Mvela Consortium. This process i s&#13;
still underway, including the due diligence o fpre-qualifiedbidders&#13;
&#13;
33.       "The Borrower has: (a) carried out an audit,property valuation, and actuarial study of&#13;
NIC, and (b) approved a strategyfor the divestiture of NIC, in accordance withparagraph 47 of&#13;
the LDP.''&#13;
&#13;
34.      The Borrowerhas met this condition. (a) The following studiedtasks havebeen&#13;
completed: (i) Audit &amp; Operations Review, which was completed inOctober 2002; (ii)&#13;
                NIC                                                                               NIC&#13;
Market Review &amp; Privatization Options Study which was completed inJune 2002, (iii)            Fixed&#13;
Assets verification and valuation; (iv) Accounting Support to NIC management to reflect the true&#13;
financial positiono fNIC; and (v) the actuarial valuation o fNIC was completed inNovember&#13;
2003, (b) InMarch2004, the Cabinet approved the recommendedprivatization strategy, notably&#13;
to sell life and non-life businesses o f NIC with specific assets and liabilities attached to them&#13;
separately (or together) and to sell the remaining assets to pay old claims as a preferred&#13;
divestitureoption for the NIC. Government will sell the majority of capitalto a strategic&#13;
investor/partner, preferably inconsortium with Tanzanian investors. The Government will retain&#13;
30% interest inthe business to be sold, that will be offeredto the public at a later stage.&#13;
&#13;
35.      "The Borrower has developed and approved optionsfor divesting or liquidating: (a) the&#13;
remaining cashew nutprocessing plants, (b) NARCO ranches, and (c) NAFCO wheat, rice and&#13;
maizefarms, in accordance withparagraph 49 of the LDP."&#13;
&#13;
36.      The Borrowerhas met this condition. The strategy for divestingCashew nut&#13;
processing factories was approved inApril, 2002, and the facilities were advertised inMay,&#13;
2002. As these efforts to divest the cashew nut processing factories were not successful, a&#13;
revisedstrategy was approved inearly 2004 andPSRC re-advertised the cashew nutprocessing&#13;
plants for sale inMarch2004. The strategy for divestingNARCO ranches, DAFCO andNAFCO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
farms was also approved by Government at the same time, April, 2002. The Government&#13;
reached a decision to keep farms as single units except for rice farms, which have already been&#13;
partitioned. Subsequently, in2003 a Cabinet paper was prepared which further refined the&#13;
approved strategy. The process for divesting the NAFCO rice farms ( Rum, Dakawa, Kapunga&#13;
and Mbarali) is still under way and i s expected to be completed at the latest only bymid2004.&#13;
Similarly, the NAFCO maize farms (Mbozi and Namtumbo) although initially transferred to the&#13;
Tanzania Investment Center, have been placed under PSRC for divestiture bymid-2004.&#13;
