ABSTRACT&#13;
The paper describes an analytical framework designed to address some&#13;
of the important agricultural pricing issues that frequently arise in many&#13;
African countries. The paper contains a description of producer, consumer,&#13;
and marketing characteristics common to African countries (Section 1),&#13;
presents an analytical framework designed to capture these characteristics&#13;
(Section 2), outlines the policy uses of the framework (Section 3), and dis-&#13;
cusses a series of policy results derived from a prototype application of the&#13;
framework (Section 4). Two annexes complete the paper. The first contains a&#13;
rigorous, mathematical description of the model. The second describes data&#13;
requirements and potential sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Agricultural pricing issues are becoming increasingly impor-&#13;
tant as African economies adjust to changes brought about by the oil and&#13;
debt crises. Many on-going projects and structural adjustment loans in-&#13;
creasingly include specific provisions on pricing issues, or policy ad-&#13;
vice on changing various agricultural prices.    The tools available at&#13;
present to evaluate the impact of pricing policies remain inadequate,&#13;
however.&#13;
The most widely used methods on which policy advice is often&#13;
based are static measures of "price distortions", including nominal and&#13;
effective protection coefficients (NPC, EPC), domestic resource costs&#13;
(DRC), and associated welfare measures like consumer and producer sur-&#13;
pluses. NPCs and EPCs measure "distances' between market and shadow&#13;
prices but they fail to measure the welfare cost of inappropriate&#13;
pricing policies and provide no guidance whatsoever on the effect of&#13;
changes in policy on variables of interest to governments. Governments&#13;
are confronted with a variety of often conflicting goals -- minimizing&#13;
parastatal losses, increasing government revenues, increasing export&#13;
earnings, promoting growth and output response, increasing allocative&#13;
efficiency, assuring adequate nutrition and food security in urban&#13;
areas,  and  increasing  regional  and  inter-household equity.    These&#13;
mutiple and often conflicting government objectives form the basis for&#13;
the "policy dialogue" in most of the country and economic sector work at&#13;
the Bank and other donor agencies. What policymakers want to know via&#13;
this dialogue is the likely impact of recommended pricing policies on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
these objectives and the explicit tradeoffs that might be involved. To&#13;
accomplish this one needs to go beyond mere static measures of&#13;
distortion.&#13;
Consumer surplus/producer surplus analysis does examine the&#13;
consequences of policy changes on at least some government objectives&#13;
but it is confined to single price changes in independent markets. It&#13;
fails to capture the effects of multiple price changes in interdependent&#13;
markets.   It neglects cross-substitution effects in production and con-&#13;
sumption, cannot evaluate policies that involve pricing interventions in&#13;
multiple markets and fail to account for the joint household-firm&#13;
aspects of agricultural households.      To capture these effects, the&#13;
analyst needs a multi-market framework.    In this approach, one models&#13;
explicitly all those markets that are closely linked but stops of a full&#13;
general equilibrium model.    In this way, it is hoped that the major&#13;
interactions are captured while avoiding the complexity of an economy-&#13;
wide model.&#13;
This paper presents an analytical framework for such a multi-&#13;
market analysis of the impact of pricing policies in the agricultural&#13;
sector.    It is specially geared to taking account of some of the&#13;
realities in the African context -- pervasive government interventions&#13;
via marketing boards and parastatals and the existence of dual and&#13;
segmented formal and informal markets that often result from such&#13;
interventions.   The model is tested for a "prototype" African economy&#13;
using synthetic data, to show that such a model could be actually made&#13;
operational. The model simulations yield a rich variety of results --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
many of them counter-intuitive. The welfare implications of this "full&#13;
model" approach are compared with those of a "simple model" based on&#13;
measures of consumer and producer surpluses.       The simple models are&#13;
found to give results that are of the wrong magnitude or in the wrong&#13;
direction, particularly where substitution in production and consumption&#13;
are important and where price changes in multiple markets are involved.&#13;
Policy advice to resort to "border pricing" for example, must be&#13;
modified if the government wishes to generate revenue from the&#13;
agricultural sector.    Once one departs from the "border-price" rule,&#13;
however, it is necessary to consider questions such as -- should outputs&#13;
be taxed at the same rate?     Should fertiliser be subsidised to offset&#13;
disincentives arising from the taxation of outputs? Should export crops&#13;
be taxed at a different rate from domestic food crops?      In such cases&#13;
the use of a limited general equilibrium model like the one developed in&#13;
this paper will yield the relevant information and, one hopes, lead to a&#13;
richer dialogue and better policy advice.&#13;
The next step is to test these models in an actual country&#13;
specific context.   This is now being done at the Bank with studies in&#13;
Malawi, Sierra Leone and Senegal.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Agricultural pricing issues are of critical importance in all&#13;
African countries and are becoming a central concern in both project and&#13;
program  lending.    In project lending, for example, many on-going&#13;
agricultural projects include specific legal provisions on pricing&#13;
issues. .2   These include joint reviews by Bank and borrower of any&#13;
price changes, provisions for maintaining minimum producer price levels,&#13;
prohibitions on regulating prices in project areas, and establishment of&#13;
project prices in relation to world markets or with a view to promoting&#13;
sound financial operations of parastatals.     In program documents the&#13;
level of domestic agricultural prices, either in relation to import or&#13;
export parity prices or to domestic prices of inputs or other commodi-&#13;
ties, are constantly cited as a major source of "distortion' and a&#13;
barrier to both domestic and export growth. In Kenya, for example, the&#13;
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) program explicitly proposes that&#13;
"marketing and pricing policies pay closer attention to the structure of&#13;
domestic and international prices and that the marketing system be made&#13;
more competitive and efficient to improve prices for farmers". 2 In&#13;
1/    In Zaire, for example, there are provisions that require annual&#13;
reviews or specific consultations on prices for beef (First Livestock&#13;
Development Project), for seed cotton, cotton fiber and lint (Cotton&#13;
Rehabilitation Projects), for palm oil (Oil Palm Project), for sugar&#13;
(Kwilu-Ngonjo Sugar Project), for maize (Smallholder Maize Project) and&#13;
livestock (Ituri Livestock Development Project).    Similar examples can&#13;
be cited for other countries in the region.&#13;
2/    "Report and Recommendation of the President, the I.D.A., to the&#13;
Executive Directors on Proposed Structural Adjustment Credits to the&#13;
Republic of Kenya," February 11, 1980, p.5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the second SAL in Kenya, a major focus of the structural adjustment&#13;
strategy was the improvement of marketing and pricing policies in order&#13;
to ensure adequate incentives to producers.&#13;
Governments   in  Africa   effectively   regulate  prices   and&#13;
commodity flows via monopolies granted to parastatal/marketing boards,&#13;
via commodity and export taxes, via control of wholesale and retail&#13;
prices to processors and consumers, via control of imports and exports&#13;
of agricultural   goods and via the exchange rate.        The problem of&#13;
"getting the prices right" in agriculture is not, therefore, a simple&#13;
one. Often the constant plea to get "producer incentives right" is not&#13;
supported by an analytical framework capable of treating the pervasive&#13;
effects of government regulations on prices and markets.     A continuing&#13;
problem with giving "operationally relevant"      advice on agricultural&#13;
pricing policies is the difficulty of anticipating the effects of price&#13;
changes in a broad enough framework where many interactions and their&#13;
effects can be incorporated and measured. In many cases price programs&#13;
go awry, not because the intended objectives of the programs are unclear&#13;
(though this may also be the case), but because their quantitative&#13;
effects are inadequately understood and measured.&#13;
1.1 The Linkages in the System&#13;
A change in relative product prices has implications for a&#13;
variety of economic agents in a country.&#13;
Producer behavior is affected by changes in producer prices&#13;
both in terms of the response of agricultural output at the farm level,&#13;
as well as in terms of the surplus marketed.      Typically one needs to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
distinguish the response of the commercial (usually large-scale estate)&#13;
sector from the response of traditional smallholders, not only because&#13;
the former has better access to inputs, and uses different technologies&#13;
and factor proportions, but also because of differences in marketing&#13;
behavior. Large farmers usually produce solely for market and generally&#13;
market  through   formal  channels.    To   the  extent  that  these  are&#13;
"controlled", either via marketing boards for export crops or through&#13;
parastatal purchases for domestic distribution of food crops, the large&#13;
scale commercial producers will face controlled prices. If the govern-&#13;
ment sets a floor price at which it agrees to buy output and there is no&#13;
other outlet, this sector effectively responds to changes in the "floor&#13;
price".&#13;
In contrast, traditional smallholders respond differently both&#13;
because they have less access to inputs and use different technologies&#13;
and because they market most of their surplus through informal&#13;
channels. The effective price faced by small producers may be higher or&#13;
lower than the government "floor price" set in the formal market.      If&#13;
the free market price is higher (say in a 'bad harvest' year), most if&#13;
not all of the marketed surplus will flow through informal channels.&#13;
If, on the other hand, smallholders face a lower price than that offered&#13;
by the marketing board (say in a 'good harvest' year) then there is a&#13;
tendency for some of the marketed surplus to flow from informal to&#13;
formal markets. The extent of this leakage will depend primarily on the&#13;
perceived price differentials between the "free market" and the "floor&#13;
price" and on transportation and marketing costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
It is possible that in the case of export crops, smallholders&#13;
have no outlets other than formal market channels controlled by&#13;
marketing boards.   The recent experience in some African countries of&#13;
export crops being smuggled across national boundaries, however,&#13;
suggests that this control is far from perfect.    In this case a form of&#13;
reverse leakage may occur from formal to informal markets. The extent&#13;
of this leakage will depend primarily on the price differentials between&#13;
world market prices evaluated at the black market exchange rate and&#13;
domestic prices and on transportation and marketing (smuggling) costs.&#13;
Because domestic prices offered by marketing boards for export crops&#13;
have not in general reflected the overvaluation of the exchange rate,&#13;
parastatals/marketing boards are losing control of the domestic output&#13;
of export crops as a result of smuggling. The profits to be earned by&#13;
such transactions, especially if consumer goods can be smuggled back to&#13;
sell at a premium, are potentially enormous.&#13;
Consumer behavior of both urban and rural households is aiso&#13;
affected by relative price changes. Urban demand for foodgrains is of-&#13;
ten supplied from the formal market (i.e. from parastatal purchases, in-&#13;
ventories and imports) and governments often set a ceiling price which&#13;
they attempt to enforce. These prices frequently have a high element of&#13;
subsidy (purchase price plus transportation and marketing costs minus&#13;
the sales price) that has to be absorbed either through parastatal loss-&#13;
es or government deficits. If the ceiling price at which the government&#13;
sells food in urban areas is below the import parity price (plus trans-&#13;
portation), the loss accrues to the agency that deals with imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The demand for food crops by rural households depends on their&#13;
dual function as households and as firms.    As households, their demand&#13;
depends on incomes, household size and relative prices, but unlike urban&#13;
and other consumers their incomes are not independent of changes in&#13;
relative farm prices, because a change in relative farm prices also&#13;
changes their farm incomes. Thus for example, an increase in the price&#13;
of a staple crop will reduce the demand for that staple in urban and&#13;
landless rural households.    But in traditional smallholder households,&#13;
which produce both for own-consumption (subsistence) and for the market,&#13;
two countervailing effects are evident:       first, an increase in the&#13;
relative price will lead to a reduction in demand and, second, an&#13;
increase in the relative price will increase farm profits and hence&#13;
income and will lead to an increase in demand for the staple. The net&#13;
effect (and hence the amount of output retained for home consumption)&#13;
will depend on the relative strength of these factors. -     The marketed&#13;
surplus response to prices will also change because it depends on the&#13;
joint response to price variations of the farm as producer and the&#13;
household as consumer.&#13;
Parastatal marketing behavior and budgets are affected because&#13;
parastatals and marketing boards are the main agencies involved in&#13;
procurement, government sales, and in some cases imports and exports.&#13;
1/   There is ample empirical evidence for this based on the integrated&#13;
theory of consumption-production responses in agricultural households in&#13;
many  LDCs.    See   Barnum  and  Squire,  A  Model  of  an  Agricultural&#13;
Household:    Theory and Evidence,   World Bank Staff Occasional Paper&#13;
No.27, 1974, and Ahn, Singh and Squire (1981) for two recent studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The procurement or floor prices set by parastatals are their marginal&#13;
costs while the "ceiling prices" at which they are allowed to sell are&#13;
their marginal revenues.   The difference between these two (the markup&#13;
by definition) should cover transportation, storage and administrative&#13;
costs  if the entity is to make a profit.          More often than not,&#13;
parastatals incur heavy losses because their markup is insufficient.&#13;
Transportation and storage costs can be especially high where there is a&#13;
policy   of   pan-territorial   or   pan-temporal   pricing   imposed  on&#13;
parastatals.   Deficits also occur if imports are sold at a price below&#13;
import parity plus handling costs.       The losses are covered either&#13;
through government loans (that are written off after they accumulate for&#13;
several years) or through government budgetary allocations.     In either&#13;
case there is a substantial impact on parastatal budgets and operations.&#13;
Government budgets and foreign exchange earnings are affected&#13;
by price changes because governments support parastatal deficits and&#13;
because commodity taxes are levied on imports and exports. The extent&#13;
of parastatal deficits depends not only on the declared floor and&#13;
ceiling prices but also on the volume of procurement and sales&#13;
undertaken.   But both procurement and sales are unpredictable because&#13;
they depend on producer and consumer response to declared prices.      If&#13;
producer prices are set too low (in relation to the informal or free&#13;
market) the levels of procurement will be low and demand at declared&#13;
ceiling prices will have to be met through imports. On the other hand&#13;
if these prices are set too high, procurement will be heavy and the&#13;
excess of procurement over sales will have to be stored (at a cost) or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
exported (perhaps at a loss).    If imports are sold at a price below&#13;
import parity plus handling costs, there will be a budgetary loss. If&#13;
export parity prices are below the procurement price plus handling&#13;
(transportation plus administration) costs there will also be a loss.&#13;
These losses will have to be borne by government budgets.&#13;
In addition, government revenues as well as foreign exchange&#13;
earnings are affected by commodity taxes.    Commodity taxes on export&#13;
crops are a major source of government revenue in the region.       The&#13;
higher the commodity tax, however, the lower the proportion of the&#13;
export parity price that can be passed onto producers as an incentive.&#13;
When high commodity taxes are combined with transportation, marketing&#13;
and administrative costs, little is left by way of incentives for export&#13;
producers.   As a result, high commodity tax rates usually imply lower&#13;
production and procurement levels and lower total government revenues.&#13;
Commodity taxes are, therefore, an essential element of "pricing&#13;
policies" affecting production, exports and government revenues.&#13;
It is clear from this discussion that an analysis of pricing&#13;
and marketing policies in the real world is complicated.      There are&#13;
multiple instruments that can be manipulated:    producer prices, input&#13;
prices, consumer prices, commodity taxes and exchange rates.    Also, a&#13;
large number of "institutions" may be involved: government parastatals&#13;
involved in domestic procurements and sales in addition to private&#13;
traders and "unofficial" or "black" markets. Furthermore, in evaluating&#13;
the impact of policy interventions governments are seldom interested in&#13;
single-criterion  objectives,  be   they  "assuring  self-sufficiency",&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
increasing producer incomes or promoting efficiency.    Instead they are&#13;
often concerned with a set of multiple objectives -- promoting&#13;
efficiency   and  welfare,  increasing   government  revenues,   reducing&#13;
parastatal losses, increasing foreign exchange earnings, assuring food&#13;
security -- that are often in conflict.      To evaluate the impact of&#13;
pricing choices, they wish to know the "trade-off" between multiple&#13;
objectives.   Any actual policy dialoge with policymakers makes this&#13;
clear.&#13;
So what at first instance seems merely a matter of "providing&#13;
producer incentives" or "getting the prices right" actually involves a&#13;
large   number  of   detailed   policy  instruments   and   institutions.&#13;
Government intervention in agricultural markets raises many of the&#13;
questions -- urban vs rural income distribution, the role of commodity&#13;
taxes, parastatal efficiency, the role of private traders, the level of&#13;
incentives to farmers, the budgetary cost of food subsidies, the role of&#13;
agriculture as a source of foreign exchange - that are central to the&#13;
policy discussions underway in most East African countries.      Specific&#13;
policy advice, however, needs to be based on a careful analysis of the&#13;
set of multiple but interlinked policy instruments as they affect a set&#13;
of multiple objectives that are of interest to policymakers.         This&#13;
requires   an   integrated  analytical   framework   within   which  the&#13;
quantitative impact of alternative prices, commodity taxes, subsidies&#13;
and exchange rates can be evaluated on a set of alternative objectives.&#13;
The purpose of this study is to develop an integrated&#13;
analytical framework that can be used to trace the impact of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
agricultural prices, commodity taxes and subsidies on agricultural&#13;
production,   domestic  procurement  and   consumption,  parastatal   and&#13;
government revenues and the levels of domestic and foreign trade in the&#13;
main agricultural commodities.    To demonstrate the usefulness of this&#13;
framework as an operational tool, we present an application based on a&#13;
prototype African economy.&#13;
II. THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK /&#13;
In developing an analytical framework to examine these issues&#13;
at least three broad components can be identified:    the supply system,&#13;
the demand system, and the marketing or intermediation system. 2 These&#13;
categories are not mutually exclusive and may overlap but they help us&#13;
identify components that need to be modeled.     What follows is a brief&#13;
description of each system for an illustrative African case.&#13;
2.1 The Supply System&#13;
We   begin   by  distinguishing   two   broad   categories   of&#13;
agricultural commodities -- food crops and export crops. The main&#13;
1/   We try to capture some of the main features of the supply, demand,&#13;
and marketing systems that are common to many African countries. But in&#13;
any particular country, the specific organization of markets and insti-&#13;
tutions will differ from those described here.&#13;
2/    Again these are illustrativei food crops could include cassava,&#13;
millet, rice or any other item produced on the farms while export crops&#13;
could be cotton, groundnuts, oilseeds, or cocoa depending on the country&#13;
under consideration.&#13;
&#13;

- 10 -&#13;
reason for this is that, whereas the former are grown mainly for&#13;
domestic consumption, the latter find their final markets abroad.       In&#13;
our example, the main food crops are maize, wheat and beans and the&#13;
illustrative export crops are coffee and tea.       Although in any real&#13;
economy there are many crops, the intention is to focus on the major&#13;
crops only. 1/&#13;
These commodities are produced by two broad categories of&#13;
producers -- traditional smallholders (the small farm sector) and large-&#13;
scale (usually mechanized) commercial farms (the large farm or estate&#13;
sector). 2/    The small farms are assumed to produce mainly maize and&#13;
beans as food crops and the main part of their output is for on-farm&#13;
subsistence consumption.    They also produce export crops -- tea and&#13;
coffee -- for cash sales to marketing boards but destined eventually for&#13;
exports. The large farms produce maize and wheat, mainly for commercial&#13;
1/   For example, in Kenya coffee and tea accounted for 57.6% of total&#13;
exports in 1977.   Maize and beans (in pure and mixed stands) accounted&#13;
for 79% of the total crop hectarage in the small farm sector, while&#13;
coffee and tea accounted for another 7.4%.      In the large farm sector&#13;
wheat and maize (in pure stand) account for 76.8% of the crop hectarage&#13;
and tea and coffee another 7% (p.40-43).       See Growth and Structural&#13;
Change in Kenya, A Basic Economic Report, Annex II:      Issues in Kenyan&#13;
Agriculture, Report No. 3350-KE, August 1982.&#13;
2/    In practice, there may be many producing agents differentiated by&#13;
farm type or region. Drawing on Kenyan data again, there were in 1977-&#13;
78 some 1.704 million small farms cultivating 3.5 m ha of farm land and&#13;
varying in size from less than 0.5 ha-8 ha; 93% of them were less than 5&#13;
ha in size.   The average size was around 2 ha.     There were some 2,406&#13;
large farms cultivating around 2.5 m ha with an average size of around&#13;
1000 ha. Another 2,275 were classified as 'mixed farms' or plantations&#13;
with an average size ranging between 400-500 ha.      There were also 100&#13;
commercial farms with an average size of around 6,500 ha each. Together&#13;
this large farm sector (some 4,835 units) farmed some 4.235 m ha of land&#13;

sale in domestic markets via a National Marketing Board, and tea and&#13;
coffee, for export through a National Export Agency.&#13;
Thus the production system for major agricultural commodities&#13;
in our illustrative example can be characterized as follows: 1,&#13;
Commodities                    Producers&#13;
Food Crops&#13;
Maize                          Small and large farms&#13;
Wheat                          Large farms&#13;
Beans                          Small Farms&#13;
Export Crops&#13;
Tea                            Small and large farms&#13;
Coffee                         Small and large farms&#13;
Given this broad breakdown we can now turn to the question of&#13;
how the supply response (defined as a change in output as a consequence&#13;
of changes in farm level prices) for each commodity is determined.     In&#13;
most general terms the output of any commodity on a given farm depends&#13;
on the technology (that is, the conversion of variable factor inputs and&#13;
fixed inputs like land into outputs), the expected profitability per&#13;
acre of alternative crop outputs (i.e. alternative opportunities for the&#13;
1/   This type of breakdown may be typical in most countries in the&#13;
Eastern Africa region.    In general, a mapping of commodities by major&#13;
producers is what is required and can be handled for any number of&#13;
commodities and producers.&#13;

use of farm resources) and weather (or states of nature) that provide&#13;
random exogenous shocks that change the pattern of yields and output but&#13;
which are mainly outside the farmer's control.&#13;
Abstracting for a moment from weather effects .-/, the area&#13;
that a farmer allocates to a given crop will depend upon its relative&#13;
profitability and technology.      In making land allocation decisions,&#13;
profits per hectare will have to be equated for each land type at the&#13;
margin. We assume here that the land available for tree crop production&#13;
(tea and coffee) is given and fixed in the short run and is different&#13;
from the land available for food crop production, which is allocated&#13;
according to the marginal profit maximizing rule. Total cultivated land&#13;
in the short run is also fixed and given.&#13;
Further, we assume that farmers are price takers in input and&#13;
output markets (that is, no production group is capable of exercising&#13;
monopsonist behavior in input or monopolist behavior in output mar-&#13;
kets). 2/ Under these assumptions profits depend on the relation of&#13;
input to output prices and on technology.    Technology, however, may be&#13;
different for small and large farms.     This is so not only because of&#13;
-----------------------------------&#13;
1/ To the extent that weather effects cannot be controlled at the farm&#13;
level (apart from irrigation) they are not a decision variable for the&#13;
farmer. He incorporates weather into his "yield expectations" and hence&#13;
profit expectations. But at the aggregate level, the realized state of&#13;
nature--a good or bad harvest--very much determines the total supply&#13;
response. We treat this later.&#13;
2/   These assumptions simply imply many buyers and sellers in input and&#13;
output markets.   The existence of marketing boards that may fix input&#13;
and output prices still leaves farmers as prices takers as long as all&#13;
input demand is met at the fixed prices and all output is bought at&#13;
these prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
different techniques of production but also because of differences in&#13;
farm-specific input and/or output prices (large farmers may have "better&#13;
access" to cash inputs giving different input prices, or better access&#13;
to markets giving different output prices), and because of differences&#13;
in access to knowledge and in management capabilities. We cannot treat&#13;
these differences for each farm, but we can distinguish the differences&#13;
in technology and other factors by broad representative farm grouPS --&#13;
large and small farms in our case.&#13;
This discussion can be presented formally as follows. 1&#13;
Consider the specific case of maize on large farms. In our application,&#13;
the farmer can allocate his land to maize or wheat.       This allocation&#13;
will depend on the relative profitability per acre of each crop.     From&#13;
the above discussion, we know that profitability will depend on input&#13;
and output prices and on technology.    The profit per acre for maize is&#13;
defined as:&#13;
Profit per acre        Value of         Value of&#13;
of maize            Output           Inputs&#13;
Since the relationship between output and inputs is described by the&#13;
production function (or technology), we can rewrite this expression as:&#13;
1/   The precise functional forms of the model equations can be found in&#13;
Annex 1. This model relies heavily on two earlier efforts presented in&#13;
R.K. Sah (1982) and Braverman, Hammer and Ahn (1983) to build a general&#13;
equilibrium  framework  for analysing pricing decisions     in the rural&#13;
sector.  Our model attempts to extend this work to incorporate the dual&#13;
markets and parastatal intermediation common in East and West African&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
iT =i(P7     Tm)         -la-&#13;
that is, profits per acre of maize (t m) depend on the input and output&#13;
prices (Pm) for maize and on maize technology (Tm)* Note that this is&#13;
not simply an accounting relationship.     It includes a very important&#13;
behavioral assumption -- that farmers seek to maximize profits.&#13;
Equation la shows the maximum level of profits consistent with the&#13;
available technology   (Tm)  and given the existing prices     (Pm).   of&#13;
course, farmers are never able to maximize profits precisely. Equation&#13;
la is meant, therefore, to capture the idea that farmer behavior tends&#13;
towards  profit maximization.     There   is,  in  fact,  ample empirical&#13;
evidence to support this contention.&#13;
Whatever the maximum value of maize profits per unit of land,&#13;
the farmer will only choose to allocate land to maize production if&#13;
maize profits exceed those of other possible crops. In our example, we&#13;
have assumed that wheat is the only feasible alternative to maize on&#13;
large  farms. -Y     Implicitly,  therefore,  we  can  imagine  a farmer&#13;
constructing a relationship for wheat similar to the one depicted in&#13;
equation la for maize. Armed with this information, he can now compare&#13;
relative profitabilities and make his land allocation decision.      This&#13;
relationship may be expressed as:&#13;
1/ In principle, any number of crops can compete for any given type of&#13;
land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Am = A (7m, w )                -lb-&#13;
where the area allocated to maize      (Am)  is shown to depend on the&#13;
profitability of maize (Irm) relative to that of wheat (r) .     Assuming&#13;
the total amount of land available for wheat and maize cultivation is A,&#13;
then, if Am is allocated to maize, the remainder, A-Am, is used for&#13;
wheat.&#13;
Multiplying profit per acre (Hm)      by area (Am) provides a&#13;
measure of total profits from maize production.      Similar calculations&#13;
can be performed for wheat and for the export crops -- tea and coffee --&#13;
grown on large farms.    This allows us to arrive at a measure of total&#13;
farm profits:&#13;
Total Farm Profits =      Ei                  -1c-&#13;
i&#13;
i = maize, wheat, tea, coffee&#13;
That is, total farm profits equal the sum of profits from each of the&#13;
four crops. This expression is founded in the microeconomic behavior of&#13;
farmers. It allows us to explore the consequences of an increase in the&#13;
price of, say, fertilizer which may affect the profitability per acre of&#13;
each crop differently and may affect the allocation of land among&#13;
crops.   These interactions and substitution possibilities are captured&#13;
by this approach.&#13;
We have developed the argument in financial units. Underlying&#13;
the measures of profitability, however, are physical measures of inputs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
and outputs.   For example, corresponding to equation la for profits per&#13;
acre, we can write a yield equation. That is, implicit in equation la&#13;
is the profit-maximizing yield. For example, for maize we can write:&#13;
Maize Yield = Ym = Ym (Pm, Tm)                 -ld-&#13;
where Ym is the profit-maximizing maize yield. If we multiply yield by&#13;
area operated   (Am), we,   of course, have total supply.       Since area&#13;
operated depends on the relative profitability of maize and its possible&#13;
substitute, wheat, we know that the total supply function for maize from&#13;
large farms will depend on the input and output prices of both crops as&#13;
well as technology:&#13;
Total Farm Supply = Ym Am = sM(PMTPw     T          -le-&#13;
m           wm Tw)&#13;
We thus arrive at the traditional farm-level supply function in which&#13;
supply depends on own-price, the price of substitutes, the price of&#13;
inputs, and technology.&#13;
To arrive at total supply of maize, we also have to allow for&#13;
maize production on small farms. Their supply also depends on relative&#13;
profitabilities, but, in this case, the alternative is beans. We can,&#13;
therefore, write a total economy-wide supply function of maize as:&#13;
Total Maize Supply = S = nsL + ks-f-&#13;
m    m     m&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
where n is the number of large farms, k is the number of small farms,&#13;
L       8&#13;
and s    and s  ,     the supply from a representative large and small&#13;
m       m&#13;
farm, respectively.&#13;
Similar arguments apply to inputs. For example, implicit in&#13;
equation la for profits per acre is a measure of, say, fertilizer per&#13;
acre. We can, therefore, construct an equation which shows the profit-&#13;
maximizing level of fertilizer per acre in exactly the same way we&#13;
constructed an equation for the profit-maximising yield of maize (see.&#13;
equation ld).   This input of fertilizer will, therefore, depend on all&#13;
input and output prices for maize (Pm) and on maize technology (Tm).&#13;
This exercise can be repeated for each crop, and, given the allocation&#13;
of land among different crops, we can arrive at a total farm demand for&#13;
fertilizer that parallels equation le for the total farm supply of&#13;
maize.    Finally, we can aggregate over all farms to obtain total&#13;
fertilizer demand:&#13;
Total Fertilizer Demand = Df - ndL + kd"      -l1g-&#13;
f  f     f&#13;
where n is the number of large farms, k the number of small farms, and&#13;
dL and ds , the demand from a representative large and small farm,&#13;
f      f&#13;
respectively. Similarly, total demand can be estimated for other inputs&#13;
-- seeds, insecticides, labor and machinery.&#13;
Equations la - lg describe the supply side of the model. They&#13;
are, of course, repeated for each crop and for each type of farm. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
development of a model which both specifies farm-level behavior (e.g.,&#13;
equations la through le) and allows the consistent derivation of total,&#13;
economy-wide   supply   (equation  lf)  has   two  advantages.     First,&#13;
information on microeconomic variables -- farm budgets, input-output&#13;
relations -- can be used to estimate the farm-level equations.      These&#13;
are sufficient for the derivation of total supply response.      Alterna-&#13;
tively, one can work backwards from total supply response elasticities&#13;
to arrive at the farm-level equations.    Ideally, both kinds of informa-&#13;
tion can be used to increase confidence in the model's numerical&#13;
values. Second, the approach yields the results of greatest interest to&#13;
the policymaker.   The model indicates the effect of alternative pricing&#13;
policies on total farm profits (equation lc) and thus elucidates the&#13;
consequences for equity, and on total supply (equation if) thereby&#13;
providing insight into the consequences for self-sufficiency, the&#13;
balance of payments,    and government revenues.     These equations are&#13;
discussed further in Section 3.&#13;
2.2 The Demand System&#13;
The demand system can be divided into two broad domestic&#13;
groups -- urban and rural consumers -- and foreign demand via exports.&#13;
It is useful to identify the demand for each commodity by different&#13;
income (expenditure) classes, because both income and price elasticities&#13;
may differ as incomes rise. In urban areas three broad (but arbitrary)&#13;
income classes are identified on the basis of per capita income or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
expenditure levels: high income, middle income, and low income.-L Urban&#13;
households consume all the major food crops with high income groups&#13;
showing a preference for wheat (which is a 'superior' crop while beans&#13;
is an 'inferior' crop) in their diets.    They derive these incomes from&#13;
wages, salaries and other sources.     Nominal incomes are given and not&#13;
affected by changes in agricultural prices.&#13;
In rural areas three separate but distinct consumer groups can&#13;
also be identified: the small farm households, with 'lower incomes', the&#13;
2/&#13;
larger farm households with 'higher incomes', and landless households 2&#13;
While the first two groups derive their income primarily from farming,&#13;
the last group depends mainly on wage and salary incomes. 3/ The demand&#13;
for food crops is differentiated not only by group (income class) but&#13;
also by the type of commodity they are likely to consume.       We assume&#13;
that wheat and maize are consumed by all classes of urban and rural&#13;
households, but beans are a subsistence crop consumed mainly by lower&#13;
income groups.&#13;
-----------------------------------&#13;
1/    In principle, any number of income groups can be used.        Three&#13;
groups may be sufficient, however, to illuminate the effects of policy&#13;
on equity.&#13;
2/     Again, any number of rural household groups can be specified&#13;
according to farm type, size, region or other characteristics.&#13;
3/ In Kenya for example in 1970 about 11% of all rural households were&#13;
classified as landless. Not all the landless are poor and they consist&#13;
of a heterogenous group including agricultural laborers (17% of total),&#13;
government salaried workers (28%), shopkeepers, traders and those&#13;
involved in handicrafts and transportation (16%) and a group listed&#13;
under "other employment" (30%), p. 19, Annex 1, op.cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
The demand for export crops -- tea and coffee -- is assumed to&#13;
come from abroad, domestic demand being insignificant. -       As most of&#13;
the output moves through formal channels via marketing boards 2/ which&#13;
purchase at a fixed -- often pre-announced -- price, it is reasonable to&#13;
assume that whatever output is forthcoming is absorbed by these boards&#13;
at that price (producers face an infinitely elastic demand at the fixed&#13;
price). The marketing boards are then faced with the problem of selling&#13;
abroad the output they have secured.       But again, unless there are&#13;
monopsonist elements involved and a particular country can influence the&#13;
world price by varying the amount of its exports, the foreign demand&#13;
faced by the country may be assumed perfectly elastic at the world&#13;
price.&#13;
As with the production system, we can write the main&#13;
components of the illustration demand system as follows:&#13;
1/   This is generally the case for beverage exports.     In the case of&#13;
other non-food exports -- fibers like cotton for example -- there may be&#13;
extensive demand from domestic industries.      This has to be treated&#13;
explicitly.&#13;
2/ We shall return to the issue of informal markets for export crops in&#13;
a later section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Commodities                            Consumers&#13;
(6 income classes--3 urban, 3 rural)&#13;
Food Crops&#13;
Wheat                    - urban and rural by income class&#13;
Maize                    - urban and rural by income class&#13;
Beans                    - urban and rural by income class&#13;

The domestic demand for food crops by urban and rural house-&#13;
holds depends on per capita incomes, the price of the food crop, and the&#13;
prices of close consumption substitutes. Thus, we can write the demand&#13;
for, say, maize, by a representative urban household in the low-income&#13;
group as:&#13;
Maize Demand = dm = dm(P, Y)                             -2a-&#13;
where dm is the quantity demanded, P stands for prices, and Y for total&#13;
household income.   This function is derived by assuming that consumers&#13;
maximize utility. -    The consumer is assumed to allocate his&#13;
1/    The demand equations are based on the Almost Ideal Demand System&#13;
detailed and Muellbauer (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
expenditure among different items in order to maximize his utility (or&#13;
satisfaction) given the set of prices confronting him and given his&#13;
income. It follows that his level of maximized utility (u) is dependent&#13;
on the configuration of consumer prices and on his income:&#13;
Utility = u = u (P, Y)                                   -2b-&#13;
The estimation of a system of demand curves allows us to retrieve the&#13;
underlying utility function. This would be of no special significance,&#13;
except for the fact that changes in well-being can be measured expli-&#13;
citly and more accurately through the utility function.      For example,&#13;
the loss in consumer welfare from a price increase is usually measured&#13;
by the loss in consumer surplus.        Consumer surplus,  however,  only&#13;
provides an approximation to the true measure and is very difficult to&#13;
calculate when more than one price is changed.     The change in utility,&#13;
on the other hand, can be calculated very easily for a change in any&#13;
number of prices.    Moreover, it can be given a very precise monetary&#13;
interpretation.   It is known as the compensating variation and is the&#13;
amount of money which makes a household just as well off at the new&#13;
configuration of prices as it was at the old one.        The effect of a&#13;
change in prices, can, therefore, be expressed as the amount of income&#13;
necessary to restore the individual's previous level of welfare.     Once&#13;
the demand system has been constructed, the model is able to measure&#13;
compensating variation for any set of price changes without further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
reference  to  utility.    We return   to  the concept of    compensating&#13;
variation in Section 3.&#13;
Total demand for maize can be obtained by adding up the demand&#13;
from each group of consumers:&#13;
Total Maize Demand = Dm =   Enidmi                       -2c-&#13;
where total demand (DM ) is shown to be the sum of demand (dmi) by the&#13;
representative   house  in   the  ith  group   times  the  number (ni) of&#13;
households in the ith group.    For this application, i stands for three&#13;
urban income groups and three rural groups.&#13;
For an analysis of agricultural pricing policy, the incomes of&#13;
urban households and rural, landless households can be considered&#13;
independent of pricing policy. The incomes of farm-households, however,&#13;
are affected by changes in agricultural prices since these prices&#13;
influence farm profits and farm profits contribute to rural incomes. We&#13;
can write total income as:&#13;
Household Income = Y = R + W +      iIl                  -2d-&#13;
where R is the net return from capital assets, W is labor earnings, and&#13;
ZAi i is total farm profits (see equation lc). For urban households and&#13;
i &#13;
rural,   landless  households, EAiwi is   zero.     For  farm-households,&#13;
i&#13;
however, a change in food prices will affect demand directly through P&#13;
(see equation 2a) but it will also affect demand indirectly through Y&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(see equation 2a) because a change in food prices will affect farm&#13;
profits (DSiWi) and hence household income, Y (see equation 2d).&#13;
For example, an increase in the price of maize will reduce&#13;
consumption of maize by all households as a result of its effect through&#13;
P.   The same price increase, however, will increase farm profits for&#13;
those households cultivating maize.     The resulting increase in income&#13;
will tend to increase maize consumption.    The net effect on maize con-&#13;
sumption in farm-households is thus indeterminate. The model, however,&#13;
works out the net effect automatically; changes in farm profits are fed&#13;
in through Y.   Theoretical as well as empirical work has shown that the&#13;
joint treatment of these production-consumption interactions does make a&#13;
considerable difference when calculating consumer response to price&#13;
changes. I/&#13;
This discussion of farm-households leads naturally to a consi-&#13;
deration of marketed surplus. For example,&#13;
Marketed Surplus of Maize - n (sL - dL) + k (so - dB) -2e-&#13;
m    m        m    m&#13;
In this equation we draw on both the supply and demand systems for both&#13;
large  farms and   small farms.     The  first  term [n(sm - di)] is the&#13;
m    m&#13;
marketed surplus from large farms and the second term [k(s5 - d5)] is&#13;
that from small farms. The derivation of marketed surplus is thus based&#13;
on a careful description of both supply and demand behavior and allows&#13;

- 25 -&#13;
explicitly for the indirect effect of price changes on farm profits and&#13;
hence demand in farm-households.&#13;
As with the supply side, the demand system represented by&#13;
equations 2a through 2c provides information at both the household level&#13;
and the market level. At the household level, the most important infor-&#13;
mation provided by the model is the compensating variation or the change&#13;
in income that is necessary to fully compensate for any change in prices&#13;
(see equation 2b).   This is important from an equity standpoint.    In-&#13;
creasing producer incentives may entail higher prices for urban consu-&#13;
mers. Compensating variation provides a monetary measure of the gains&#13;
and losses to different groups of urban consumers and rural producers.&#13;
And at the market level, the model provides information on total demand&#13;
(see equation 2c) which, together with total supply, will yield implica-&#13;
tions for the balance of payments and the budget. The model also yields&#13;
estimates of marketed surplus (see equation 2e).   These estimates can,&#13;
of course, be made for each crop.&#13;
2.3 Market Intermediation&#13;
Demand and supply for agricultural commodities do not&#13;
automatically balance, nor do markets simply clear at some 'equilibrium&#13;
price".  In most African countries a great deal of intervention occurs&#13;
in markets for agricultural commodities.   This intervention takes many&#13;
forms, has a wide variety of often contradictory goals and involves a&#13;
number of government agencies.     The purpose of this section is to&#13;
describe how market intervention and intermediation occur in some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
African countries.   Then we try to 'model" this intermediation for the&#13;
major crops under consideration.&#13;
Export Crops&#13;
To start with, it is easiest to consider the export crops --&#13;
coffee and tea in our example.      We assume that both these crops are&#13;
grown primarily for export.     Between producers and final exports are&#13;
government authorized marketing boards.     For tea, we assume that the&#13;
Board inspects and buys leaf through widely dispersed centers and sells&#13;
it to factories.    It announces the price to be paid to growers, this&#13;
price being paid at time of purchase.        The green leaf is sold to&#13;
factories for drying and packaging at a fixed price. The factories then&#13;
return the dried tea to the board for export.     Tea for export is sold&#13;
via auction or private contracts.      Tea exports are taxed.    Thus the&#13;
"board" is the main agency for intermediation between producers --&#13;
smallholders and estates -- and foreign buyers, and intervenes by&#13;
setting the price facing both producers and processors. For coffee, the&#13;
marketing structure is centralized through a second Board which is&#13;
assumed to control the planting of coffee through a licensing system and&#13;
to take delivery of' all coffee produced and to sell it for export by&#13;
auction. The board sets the prices for producers and, after processing,&#13;
sells it to private exporters at what is a domestic export price&#13;
(f.o.b.) which is essentially determined by international demand and the&#13;
coffee quotas. Coffee exports are also subject to tax.&#13;
To summarize, the boards set prices to producers, have a&#13;
monopoly of purchase (directly or via agents), process the purchased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
output at some cost (again directly or via agent), and sell it for&#13;
export as price takers.   The producer price is fixed by the boards and&#13;
the export price is governed by international markets and agreements. -/&#13;
The differences between the prices paid to producers (plus transporta-&#13;
tion and intermediation costs) by the boards and the world prices (less&#13;
any export taxes) determine the losses or surpluses of the marketing&#13;
boards once we know the supply side.    It is the supply response (at a&#13;
given fixed price) that determines the volume of procurements for export&#13;
by marketing boards.    Too low a relative price means lower volumes of&#13;
procurement, high unit costs of intermediation and parastatal losses.&#13;
Too high a price may mean higher procurement but increased storage&#13;
requirements and losses if export prices cannot support the marketing&#13;
and storage costs.   In either case, it is the supply response that is&#13;
the critical determinant of the volume of procurement and hence the&#13;
profits or losses of government agencies.&#13;
Foodgrains&#13;
Intermediation in foodgrain markets is usually more complex in&#13;
most African countries. For maize, the main staple for low income rural&#13;
and urban consumers and the most important smallholder crop, the market&#13;
is assumed to be segmented. A controlled, formal segment of the market&#13;
is assumed to coexist and interact with a flourishing informal segment.&#13;
In the formal segment the main participants are licensed agents who are&#13;
authorized to purchase for government depots which in turn sell grain to&#13;
-----------------------------------&#13;
1/   Again this is illustrative.     Different mechanisms may exist for&#13;
different crops in different countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
mills for processing or directly to urban consumers.      The purchasing&#13;
agents are licensed traders who buy at a fixed price and sell only to&#13;
government depots. All government procured maize is sold in urban mar-&#13;
kets.   Large maize producers deal mainly with the formal system via&#13;
these agents.  Smallholders, on the other hand, market the main part of&#13;
their maize output via the informal system that consists of market&#13;
traders who operate mainly, but not exclusively, at the local level.&#13;
These private market agents play a critical role particularly in rural&#13;
areas because they link surplus and deficit regions and conduct the&#13;
inter-seasonal arbitrage via transportation and storage to take advan-&#13;
tage of price differentials. Competition is vigorous and there are few&#13;
barriers to entry.   The links between the formal and informal segments&#13;
of the maize market and the relationship between the fixed price of the&#13;
formal segment and the free price of the informal segment are discussed&#13;
in the next section.    Maize is used to illustrate the effects of a&#13;
partially controlled market that is segmented into formal and informal&#13;
components.&#13;
The beans and wheat markets are more easily described. Beans&#13;
are used to illustrate the effects of an entirely uncontrolled market.&#13;
Beans are produced by smallholders, marketed by means of private trad-&#13;
ers, and sold at a price that clears the internal market. There are no&#13;
exports or imports. Wheat, on the other hand, illustrates the effects&#13;
of a completely controlled market.    Wheat is grown entirely on large&#13;
farms, is marketed through government agencies at a fixed price, and is&#13;
sold, primarily to urban consumers, again at a fixed price. A shortfall&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
in supply relative to demand at the given prices is met by imports. The&#13;
wheat agencies' trade in both domestic and imported wheat is assumed to&#13;
result in substantial losses.&#13;
Inputs&#13;
Governments also intervene in the market for inputs.     In our&#13;
example, we focus exclusively on fertilizer. -/        In particular, we&#13;
assume that there is no domestic fertilizer industry and that all&#13;
imports of fertilizer are handled by a state trading corporation. This&#13;
market, therefore, is completely controlled.       Fertilizer is sold to&#13;
farmers at cost so that the accounts of the state trading corporation&#13;
balance.&#13;
2.4. Market Clearing Conditions&#13;
It is possible to characterize the market structures and means&#13;
of price determination for the various commodities in our example as&#13;
follows:&#13;
1/    Other  inputs can, of course, be      included depending  on their&#13;
importance in production and the extent of government intervention.&#13;

Inputs&#13;
Fertilizer              Formal          Prices fixed by government&#13;
For export crops the government Marketing Boards purchase all&#13;
output at fixed prices from all producers.    For maize and wheat, large&#13;
producers sell all output to offical procurement agents at fixed&#13;
prices.   For maize, smallholders sell partly to official procurement&#13;
agents at a fixed price and market the rest in private informal markets&#13;
where prices are determined by demand and supply conditions. For beans,&#13;
smallholders sell on the free market. Fertilizer imports and sales are&#13;
conducted exclusively by the public sector.&#13;
Coffee and Tea&#13;
Since all coffee and tea is exported by assumption, we can&#13;
write for, say, coffee:&#13;
Coffee Exports = E  5 SC = Coffee Supply                  -3a-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
where E stands for exports.      Prices are determined by the following&#13;
equation:&#13;
-e&#13;
Procurement Price-    p   p    t,- a - h                   -3b-&#13;
that is, the fixed price (p) received by farmers equals the export price&#13;
(pe) less any taxes (t), less the administrative, handling and transport&#13;
costs (a), and less any surplus (h) per unit of output realized from&#13;
Board operations. Since the Boards often run at a loss, h would usually&#13;
be negative.     The relationship   described by equation 3b     is often&#13;
calculated in exercises to measure nominal or effective protection.&#13;
Equations similar to 3a and 3b also apply to tea.      Because supply (S)&#13;
depends on, among other things, the fixed price (p) offered to farmers,&#13;
a change in that price will affect exports and hence the balance of&#13;
payments through equation 3a.     It will also affect government revenue&#13;
both because total supply changes and because a change in the farmgate&#13;
price implies, through equation 3b, a change in either the export tax&#13;
(t) or the marketing board's surplus (h). The same price change will,&#13;
of course, affect farm profits so that there may be repercussions on&#13;
other outputs, on the use of inputs, and on the demand for food crops by&#13;
rural households. These interactions are captured in the model and may&#13;
or may not be quantitatively significant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Maize&#13;
The maize market is the most complicated because of the co-&#13;
exsistence of an informal and a formal, segment.      The formal segment&#13;
operates much like the markets for tea and coffee:&#13;
Urban Maize Demand  = D  = n(sL    dL) + M + L            -4a-&#13;
-ii     m    m&#13;
that is, total urban demand for maize (Du) is satisfied by the marketing&#13;
board' s  control  over  the  marketed   surplus [n(sL - d )] from  large&#13;
m    m&#13;
farmers and by its ability to import (M). Imports may be planned or in&#13;
response to an emergency situation.     In addition, some maize (L) may&#13;
leak from the informal market into the formal market (if procurement&#13;
prices are sufficiently attractive) or into an urban black market.&#13;
Before considering these possibilities further, however, we complete the&#13;
description of the maize market. The procurement price is linked to the&#13;
urban consumer price as follows:&#13;
Procurement Price  = P =       a.- h                      -4b-&#13;
where the fixed procurement price (p) equals the fixed urban consumer&#13;
price (pu) less all handling costs (a) and less any surplus (h) or&#13;
deficit (if negative)    incurred by the marketing board.      Since the&#13;
marketed surplus from large farms depends on, among other things, the&#13;
procurement price, and since urban consumer demand depends on, among&#13;
other things, the fixed urban price, changes in these prices will affect&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
both demand and supply and hence the balance of payments (through&#13;
equation 4a).    They will also affect consumer welfare and producer&#13;
profits as well as government revenue.    In addition, changes in formal&#13;
market prices may exert an influence on the informal market through&#13;
their effect on leakages (L) from the informal to the formal market (see&#13;
below)  and may affect imports.      This latter possibility implies a&#13;
balance-of-payments effect and, depending on the c.i.f. price, may imply&#13;
a revenue effect. Usually, the urban consumer price (Pu) is set below&#13;
the import price so that:&#13;
Urban Price  = Pu   pm + a + h                            -4c-&#13;
m&#13;
where p is the import price, a represents handling costs and h is the&#13;
surplus (or deficit if negative) per unit of imports.&#13;
The informal market operates like a free market.     Supply and&#13;
demand are brought into balance through price adjustments:&#13;
Rural Maize Demand  - Dr - k(sm - do) - L                 -4d-&#13;
r   m    m&#13;
That is, the demand from rural, landless households (Dr) is brought iAto&#13;
balance with the marketed surplus from smallholders [k(sm - do)] less&#13;
a    a&#13;
any leakage (L) to the formal market by means of price adjustments.&#13;
Unlike the formal market where producer and consumer prices are fixed&#13;
and demand and supply are brought into (approximate) balance through&#13;
adjustments in imports (or possibly exports), in the informal market,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
price is determined from the market-clearing condition represented by&#13;
equation 4d.&#13;
A critical question, however, is the role of leakage from the&#13;
informal system to the formal system, and hence the proportion of&#13;
smallholder output that is likely to end up being marketed through&#13;
official procurement agents.     Since large producers of maize market&#13;
exclusively   through  the   formal  system,   it  is  the   behavior  of&#13;
smallholders that is of particular interest.      Although only a small&#13;
proportion of their marketed output may be sold via the formal system,&#13;
one cannot assume that the proportion is fixed. More realistically, one&#13;
would expect the level of procurement from smallholders to be higher the&#13;
greater the difference between the fixed price offered by procurement&#13;
agents and the free market price in rural areas.      If the fixed price&#13;
offered by agents is lower than the price offered by private traders,&#13;
one would not expect smallholders to sell any output via the formal&#13;
marketing channels.   It is only when free market prices fall below the&#13;
fixed prices offered by the procurement agents that one would expect a&#13;
positive leakage from informal to formal markets.&#13;
Whether or not a positive price differential exists between&#13;
fixed procurement prices and free market prices depends partly on the&#13;
level at which prices are set by policy and partly on what happens to&#13;
free market prices. In order to capture this relationship, we consider&#13;
two cases of market conditions.    First, in the case of a good harvest&#13;
year, it is very likely that a large smallholder output will induce&#13;
significant marketed surpluses in the rural areas. These in turn will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
depress free market prices to a level very likely below the fixed&#13;
procurement price, so that there will be an inducement to smallholders&#13;
to bring their output to official procurement agents for sale.     In the&#13;
case of a bad harvest year, the free market prices will tend to be much&#13;
higher and unless procurement prices are changed in response to the free&#13;
market price, smallholders will not bring their output to the procure-&#13;
ment depots, preferring instead to sell to private agents.      In such a&#13;
case official procurements will begin to fall and, if the government has&#13;
"target commitments" to meet urban consumer demand, maize will have to&#13;
be imported.   Indeed this is what happened, for example, in 1978-79 in&#13;
Kenya.   Maize production fell, this reduced official procurement, and&#13;
this, in turn, induced large-scale imports in 1979-80. 1/ In the event&#13;
that imports are insufficient to meet urban demand at the fixed selling&#13;
price, a black market may develop in urban areas. Private traders will&#13;
switch supplies into the urban market as long as the black market price&#13;
exceeds the rural free market price by more than enough to compensate&#13;
traders for transport costs and any risks associated with this illegal&#13;
activity.   The leakage in a bad harvest year, therefore, is an illegal&#13;
one from rural producers to buyers in the urban black market.&#13;
In order to capture these relationships, we define a leakage&#13;
function which relates the amount of surplus that smallholders will sell&#13;
1/   Purchases of the National Cereals and Produce Board fell from&#13;
250,000 m. tons in 1977-78 to 205,000 m. tons in 1979/80J maize sales&#13;
increased from 369,000 m. tons to 685,000 m. tons. Maize imports rose&#13;
from nothing to 438,000 m. tons in the same period.      See Kenya: Grain&#13;
Sector Survey, Report No. 4106-KE, September 9, 1982, p.44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
to procurement agents in a good harvest year to the price differential&#13;
between the fixed procurement price less the costs of transport and the&#13;
rural free market price as follows:&#13;
Good Year Leakage = L = L        c)                       -4e-&#13;
where p is the official procurement price, c is the cost of transport&#13;
borne by the farmer, and Pr is the price prevailing in rural markets.&#13;
In a good year, the leakage (L) is via official procurement agents.&#13;
This is legal.    In a bad harvest year, however, smallholder surpluses&#13;
may be moved into the urban market to take advantage of high black&#13;
market prices.   This is illegal.    In this event, the leakage function&#13;
is:&#13;
Pb - c&#13;
Bad Year Leakage    L = L (       )                       -4f-&#13;
where Pb is the black market price, and c is the cost associated with&#13;
this  illegal  activity.    No  doubt  actual marketing   conditions  and&#13;
interactions between. formal and informal markets are far more complex,&#13;
but this way of modeling market behavior captures the essential&#13;
features. 1/&#13;
1/ Smuggling, although not treated in this example, can be handled in a&#13;
similar manner.     Now,  however,  the  important differential is that&#13;
between domestic and foreign prices evaluated at some "black market"&#13;
exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
The existence of a large informal or uncontrolled market has&#13;
important implications for the conduct of pricing policy. For example,&#13;
in a good harvest year, a procurement price which exceeds by a substan-&#13;
tial margin the rural, free market price will induce smallholders to&#13;
deliver unusually large quantities of foodgrains to the official pro-&#13;
curement depots.   With more than sufficient foodgrains to meet urban&#13;
needs, the government will either have to incur storage costs or ex-&#13;
port. Since f.o.b. prices are often below the government's procurement&#13;
price, this latter possibility also entails a cost. These costs impose&#13;
effective constraints on the government's ability to manipulate its&#13;
procurement price.    In a bad harvest year, the emergence of an urban&#13;
black market may serve to alleviate the market imbalances that might&#13;
otherwise occur if the procurement price is set too low. In this case,&#13;
the main effect of the government's pricing policy will be a transfer of&#13;
income from large farms to urban consumers approximately equal to the&#13;
difference between a free market price and the official procurement&#13;
price multiplied by the quantity actually procured.&#13;
Beans&#13;
The market for beans is assumed to be free of all interven-&#13;
tion.   It is similar, therefore, to the informal market for maize.    In&#13;
particular, price is determined by the interplay of demand and supply:&#13;
Beans Demand = D  + Dr + nd  - k(sb - d&gt;) - Beans Marketed Surplus-5a-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Equation 5a shows that, the demand for beans by urban consumers (DU)&#13;
landless rural households (Dr)i and large farms (ndb) must equal the&#13;
marketed surplus (k(s - ds)] supplied by smallholders.     Price adjusts&#13;
until demand and supply are in reasonable balance.&#13;
Wheat&#13;
The wheat market is entirely controlled.       It corresponds,&#13;
therefore, to the formal market for maize.    With producer and consumer&#13;
prices fixed, supply and demand are brought into approximate balance by&#13;
recourse to imports:&#13;
Wheat Demand = D   + D  + kd = n(s L   d ) + M            -6a-&#13;
u    r     w      w    w&#13;
Total demand for wheat by urban consumers (Du), rural, landless con-&#13;
sumers  (Dr)  and  smallholders (kd ) is equated, therefore, with the&#13;
L         plu&#13;
marketed surplus from large farms [n(s - _)] plus imports (M).        The&#13;
w    w&#13;
procurement price for wheat is determined as follows:&#13;
Procurement Price  = P = Pu p  a - h                     -6b-&#13;
where Pu is the fixed consumer price (in both urban and rural markets in&#13;
this case), a represents all handling costs per unit of procurement&#13;
incurred by the marketing agency, and h represents its surplus (or defi-&#13;
cit if negative) per unit of procurement. Assuming that imports are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
subsidized, the link between the consumer price and the import price is&#13;
given by:&#13;
Consumer price  = pu = pm + a +   m                        -6c-&#13;
where pm is the import price, a represents all handling costs, and h the&#13;
surplus (or deficit if negative) per unit of imports. A change in the&#13;
procurement price and the consumer price will, therefore, affect both&#13;
producers and consumers (through equation 6a), government revenue&#13;
(through equations 6b and 6c), and the balance of payments.&#13;
Fertilizer&#13;
The demand for fertilizer is supplied entirely by imports:&#13;
Fertilizer Demand   = Pf = M = Fertilizer Imports          -7a-&#13;
All imports are handled by a state trading corporation and sales to&#13;
farmers may be subsidized. The farmgate price (p) is, therefore,&#13;
Farmgate Price   =     pm  + a + h                         -7b-&#13;
where pm is the import price, a is all handling charges, and h is&#13;
negative and represents the subsidy per unit of imports.      A change in&#13;
the farmgate price of fertilizer, therefore, will affect producers. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
will also affect the balance of payments (through equation 7a) and&#13;
government revenue (through equations 7a and 7b).&#13;
The system of equations describing the market clearing&#13;
conditions -- equations 3 through 7 -- are accounting relationships.&#13;
The behavioral content of the model is captured in the supply system&#13;
(equation 1) and the demand system (equation 2). The data requirements&#13;
of equations 3 through 7 are, therefore, not very demanding.     At most&#13;
one requires data on national aggregates -- wheat production, maize&#13;
consumption, fertilizer imports -- and on price relations -- for&#13;
example, the link between the import price of fertilizer and its&#13;
farmgate price. Most agricultural sector reports contain information of&#13;
this kind.   Unlike most sector reports, however, the model presented&#13;
here places these quantities and prices in an overall analytical&#13;
framework and explicitly treats their underlying behavioral content --&#13;
supply and demand curves.   In this way, various important interactions&#13;
are allowed for explicitly.     This aspect of the model is discussed&#13;
further in the next section which describes the uses of the model.&#13;
III. MODEL USES&#13;
3.1 Policy Instruments and Objectives&#13;
The basic purpose of the model is to provide the link between&#13;
a  set of   policy  instruments  and a    set of   objectives.    In our&#13;
application, the main policy instruments are input and output prices and&#13;
consumer prices. These prices can, however, be influenced in different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
ways. For example, a change in the rate of export taxation will affect&#13;
the farmgate prices of tea and coffee.       Alternatively, a change in&#13;
prices may be accomplished by changing the maize marketing board's mark&#13;
up. This could result in a change in both consumer and producer prices&#13;
and will certainly affect the net profits of the board.     In addition,&#13;
however, the prices of all internationally traded commodities -- inputs&#13;
and outputs -- could be changed by adjusting the nominal exchange&#13;
rate.   Obviously, an agricultural pricing model is not an appropriate&#13;
framework in which to explore all the consequences of an exchange rate&#13;
adjustment.   Nor can it serve as a means of predicting the speed and&#13;
extent of the adjustment. Nevertheless, since the alleged overvaluation&#13;
of many currencies is thought to have an especially damaging effect on&#13;
agriculture, it is of interest to consider the consequences of a common&#13;
percentage increase in the prices of all tradeable commodities.      This&#13;
percentage could then be interpreted as the lasting, real effect 'of a&#13;
larger percentage   change  in the nominal exchange     rate.    Finally,&#13;
producer and consumer prices can be changed through a combination of&#13;
changes in taxes, mark-ups, and the exchange rate.&#13;
To be of value, the model must be able to explore the&#13;
consequences of any change in pricing policy on the government's major&#13;
objectives.    In our example we consider the following objectives.&#13;
First, the government is assumed to be interested in the effect of its&#13;
pricing policies on the real incomes of household groups in both urban&#13;
and rural areas. That is, the government is assumed to have an equity&#13;
objective which implies the need to be able to estimate changes in real&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
income by household group. Second, the government is assumed to have a&#13;
revenue objective.   It is, therefore, interested in the effect of its&#13;
policies on the budget both directly through taxes and subsidies and&#13;
indirectly through parastatal surpluses and deficits. Third, we assume&#13;
that the government has a balance of payments objective.       The model&#13;
should, therefore, be able to predict the effect of different price&#13;
structures on agriculture's net contribution (possibly negative) to&#13;
foreign exchange earnings.   A fourth objective of the government is to&#13;
secure self-sufficiency in its basic food crop, maize. It is necessary,&#13;
therefore, to explore how the country's dependence on maize imports&#13;
varies as prices are changed.   Finally, the government is assumed to be&#13;
concerned that the country's resources are used as efficiently as&#13;
possible.   That is, governments are anxious to ensure that the incomes&#13;
derived from a given quantity of agricultural inputs are as large as&#13;
possible. Obviously, there is no reason to suppose that any particular&#13;
price policy will achieve all objectives simultaneously. The essential&#13;
purpose of the model, therefore, is to illuminate the trade-offs among&#13;
the different objectives as revealed by the adoption of alternative&#13;
pricing policies.&#13;
3.2 Household Incomes and Equity&#13;
The supply system (equation 1) and the demand system (equation&#13;
2) yield important information about the effect of pricing policy on&#13;
different   household   groups.     Recall   that  these   systems  have&#13;
microeconomic foundations.   For example, the effect on farm profits of&#13;
any exogenous change in input or output prices at the farmgate can be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
calculated through equation lc. Since this equation allows for changes&#13;
in both yield and the allocation of land among crops, it captures the&#13;
important (first-round) substitution effects. Thus, a reduction in the&#13;
price of, say, fertilizer can be expected to increase total farm profits&#13;
and the supply of those crops that make intensive use of fertilizer (see&#13;
equation le).&#13;
These first-round effects, however, are not the end of the&#13;
matter. -The increase in farm profits will imply an increase in total&#13;
household income (see equation 2d) which will, in turn, increase demand&#13;
for all food crops.   The change in the marketed surplus of food crops,&#13;
therefore, depends on both the supply response and the demand response&#13;
(see equation 2e) in farm households. Assume that the marketed surplus&#13;
of both wheat and beans is increased as a result of the original reduc-&#13;
tion in the price of fertilizer.    Since the consumer price of wheat is&#13;
set by the government, demand by urban consumers and the rural landless&#13;
will be unaffected.   The increase in marketed surplus will, therefore,&#13;
allow the government to decrease wheat imports.      The price of beans,&#13;
however, is free to adjust to changes in demand and supply.      For this&#13;
crop, therefore, the increase in marketed surplus will elicit a reduc-&#13;
tion in the free market price. But a change in the price of beans will&#13;
imply a second round of adjustments in yields and land allocation.&#13;
These second-round effects may or may not be quantitatively signifi-&#13;
cant.   An important attribute of the model is that they are captured&#13;
automatically at no cost to the analyst.     The model yields a solution&#13;
that corresponds to the ultimate resting place of the system following&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
any exogenous price change.     It is possible, therefore, to test the&#13;
significance of allowing for these interactions and second-order effects&#13;
by comparing the results of the model with those of simpler approaches.&#13;
Once the model has been solved, the analyst can report the&#13;
changes in farm profits (see equation lc) for each representative&#13;
household. This is important information and the consequences for farm&#13;
profits of several alternative pricing policies are reported in our&#13;
simulation results. This information is not sufficient, however, in the&#13;
event that consumer prices also change.     What the analyst or policy-&#13;
maker really needs is a measure indicating whether or not a household&#13;
group has benefited by a particular policy change, and by how much.&#13;
Changes in nominal incomes do not provide this information when consumer&#13;
prices are also changing. And for some households - rural landless and&#13;
urban households -- nominal incomes may have remained unchanged but any&#13;
change in consumer prices for basic foods would obviously affect these&#13;
households in a very real sense.       We, therefore, need a method of&#13;
measuring changes in well-being when consumer prices change whether or&#13;
not nominal incomes are also changing.&#13;
One relatively simple procedure involves deflating nominal&#13;
incomes by some price index.     Then, even if nominal incomes do not&#13;
change, real incomes -- nominal income deflated by the price index --&#13;
will still be affected by changes in prices. One difficulty with this&#13;
approach is that the choice of weights for the price index is&#13;
arbitrary.   An alternative procedure is to take advantage of the fact&#13;
that the utility function underlying the demand system offers a precise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
means of measuring changes in well-being. Moreover, this measure can be&#13;
given a simple monetary interpretation -- it is the amount of income&#13;
which makes a household just as well off at the new configuration of&#13;
prices at it was at the old set.       This, of course, is a well-known&#13;
concept in welfare economics and is usually described as the compen-&#13;
sating variation.     Since it is calculated by keeping constant the&#13;
household's level of satisfaction as prices change, it requires that:&#13;
u (P , Y ) = u (p , Y   + C)                                  -8a-&#13;
where u(P0,Y0) is the level of utility at the old set of prices (PO) and&#13;
with income Y°, and u (P , Y   + e) is the same level of utility at the&#13;
new  set  of prices   (P1) and with    income  Y° + e.    In  this  case,&#13;
therefore, e measures the change in income required to compensate for&#13;
the change in prices.    e may, of course, be either positive or nega-&#13;
tive. Since for some households -- smallholders and large farms -- farm&#13;
profits may also change, the measure of c is obtained from:&#13;
u (p°, Y0) - u (P , Y   + e)                                  -8b-&#13;
where the introduction of y1 on the right hand side allows for the&#13;
price-induced change in household income.&#13;
The simulation results in Section 4 report the effect of a&#13;
price change on the nominal incomes of smallholders and large farms. In&#13;
particular, we report the change in nominal farm profits from equation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
lc. In addition, we show the effect on real incomes defined as nominal&#13;
incomes deflated by a simple price index.      These results are reported&#13;
for all household groups and are a good measure of the effects of a&#13;
price change on equity. In this application, we have not calculated the&#13;
measures of compensating variation.&#13;
3.3. Budget Revenues, Foreign Exchange and Self-Sufficiency&#13;
The system of market-clearing equations -- equations 3a, 4a,&#13;
6a and 7a -- for the crops and inputs controlled or partially controlled&#13;
by the public sector provides information on quantities of exports for&#13;
tea and coffee, of procurement and imports for maize, and of imports of&#13;
wheat and fertilizer. As can be seen from equations 3b, 4b, 4c, 6b, 6c,&#13;
and 7b, all these activities are either taxed or subsidized.         These&#13;
equations can be used, therefore, to measure the overall budget deficit&#13;
or surplus associated with any particular agricultural pricing and&#13;
marketing policy.     Government revenues are derived from agriculture&#13;
through export taxes or through profits from market intermediation:&#13;
Net Revenue = NR = EC tc + E TtT&#13;
+ [n ( S  - d   + L]h   + (SL - dL)h                            -9a-&#13;
m    m       m      w    w  w&#13;
+ M h  + M h  + M h&#13;
m m    w w     F F&#13;
where the first line represents tax revenues from coffee (c) and tea&#13;
(T), the second line shows marketing revenues from maize (M) and wheat&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
(w), and the third line indicates marketing revenues from imports of&#13;
maize, wheat, arnd fertilizer (F). Usually, the marketing board's price&#13;
margin will be insufficient to cover its costs, so the unit revenues (h)&#13;
from marketing, and the contribution to net revenue, will be negative.&#13;
This assumes that any profits or losses incurred by the parastatals&#13;
ultimately accrue to the central government. Accepting this assumption,&#13;
equation 9a provides the most realistic assessment of the fiscal burden&#13;
generated  by  the  government's   agricultural  pricing  policy.    Our&#13;
simulations report the changes in equation 9a induced by changes in&#13;
pricing policy.&#13;
We can, of course, conduct a similar exercise to identify the&#13;
effect of any change    in prices on the balance of payments.        The&#13;
government' s foreign exchange earnings are generated by coffee (c) and&#13;
tea (T) exports. Therefore, gross foreign exchange earnings are:&#13;
Gross Foreign Exchange Revenues - GFER - ECpe + ETPe          -9b-&#13;
The model allows for the possibility of maize and wheat exports, which&#13;
would contribute to foreign exchange earnings.      These rarely occur,&#13;
however.   From its transactions in the international market for maize&#13;
(m), wheat (w) and fertilizer (F), gross foreign exchange expenditures&#13;
are:&#13;
Gross Foreign Exchange Expenditures - GFEE - M p + M p   + M pF   -9c-&#13;
wpw      j--cF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
The net balance-of-payments effect, therefore is:&#13;
Net Foreign Exchange Revenue     GFER - GFEE                      -9d-&#13;
The effect of alternative pricing policies on equation 9d is also&#13;
reported in the simulation exercise. There is no reason, of course, to&#13;
suppose that policies which yield benefits in terms of budget revenues&#13;
will also necessarily yield benefits in terms of foreign exchange&#13;
revenues.&#13;
Many governments are also interested in self-sufficiency,&#13;
especially   with  respect  to  their   food  crops  in urban   areas.    To&#13;
illustrate this point, the model computes the urban self-sufficiency&#13;
index for maize.     This index is defined as the ratio of domestically&#13;
procured production to total urban consumption at the official consumer&#13;
price in urban areas.&#13;
That is,&#13;
L        + L&#13;
Maize Urban Self-Sufficiency Index    nsm - ncm+L                     -9e-&#13;
D (p ) x 100%&#13;
u u&#13;
L ~ ~ ~ ~  ~   ~   ~~~U U&#13;
where (ns   - nd ) is procurement from large farms, L is procurement from&#13;
m      m&#13;
small farms, and Du is urban demand evaluated at the official price&#13;
Pue    A ratio of    100%  indicates  complete  self-sufficiency   in urban&#13;
areas. A ratio of 95% implies that 5% of domestic urban consumption has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
to be imported. Efforts to secure a higher urban self-suffiiency ratio&#13;
may, of course, imply costs in terms of the other objectives.        This&#13;
trade-off is analyzed in our results.&#13;
The market-clearing equations and their associated price rela-&#13;
tionships thus provide information on several objectives usually&#13;
considered important by policymakers.    Moreover, the consequences for&#13;
government revenue, the balance of payments, and urban food self-&#13;
sufficiency are calculated when full allowance is made for interactions&#13;
between outputs and inputs and for substitution possibilities in&#13;
production  and  consumption.    As we   shall  show in the    simulation&#13;
exercise, this point becomes extremely important when more than one&#13;
price is changed.&#13;
3.4 Resource Allocation&#13;
Governments, and the World Bank, are also concerned with&#13;
efficient resource allocation.    In particular, one would like to know&#13;
whether or not a change in pricing policy improves the allocation of&#13;
resources.   Since an improvement in resource allocation implies a net&#13;
increase in real incomes, one wants to know whether or not a change in&#13;
pricing policy increases net real income aggregated over all affected&#13;
parties in the economy.     In our particular application, a change in&#13;
prices affects rural farm households (through a change in producer&#13;
income and a change in consumer prices), all rural, landless and all&#13;
urban households (through a change in consumer prices), and the&#13;
government (through a change in its net revenues).     If the sum of (a)&#13;
changes in the real incomes of all private agents affected by the policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
change and (b) the induced change in government revenue is positive, net&#13;
real incomes have increased, and overall resource allocation has&#13;
improved.&#13;
The results given so far contain all the information necessary&#13;
to measure the change in resource allocation. Thus, the change in real&#13;
income or the compensating variation -- that is, that amount of income&#13;
necessary to compensate for a given change in prices -- has already been&#13;
calculated for pure consumers (equation 8a) and for consumer/producers&#13;
(equation 8b).     Similarly, the change in net revenue      (measured by&#13;
equation 9a) provides an approximate measure of the change in real&#13;
income accruing to the government.        This measure   is described as&#13;
approximate because it. does not allow for the fact that the prices of&#13;
some commodities - food crops and export crops -- have changed.&#13;
However, since the measure of net revenue is calculated after allowing&#13;
for  the  government's  expenditure   (i.e.  subsidies)  in the affected&#13;
markets, it is reasonable to assume that its remaining expenditure is on&#13;
commodities and services for which prices have not changed.        In this&#13;
event, our measure of nominal net revenue from equation 9a equals the&#13;
increase in real government income.&#13;
The improvement in resource allocation or the increase in the&#13;
country's overall level of welfare (OW) following a policy change can be&#13;
measured, therefore, as follows.&#13;
Change in Welfare   - ow- En ici + ANR                         -1Oa-&#13;
ii&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
where el is the change in real income or the compensating variation for&#13;
the representative   household of the    ith type, n   is the number of&#13;
households in the ith group, and ANR is the change in net revenue&#13;
accruing to the government.      Note that the efficiency of resource&#13;
allocation is improved if the sum of all items on the right hand side of&#13;
equation 10a is positive. This, of course, implies that some groups or&#13;
even the government may suffer losses and yet the overall allocation of&#13;
resources may still be improved.      This measure, therefore, abstracts&#13;
from equity considerations. The focus is exclusively on 'the efficiency&#13;
of resource allocation. The success of a particular policy intervention&#13;
with respect to this objective must, therefore, be evaluated by&#13;
reference to the effect on other objectives. This task is undertaken in&#13;
Section 4.&#13;
IV. SAMPLE MODEL SIMULATION RESULTS&#13;
The purpose of this section is to present some results from&#13;
the prototypical model outlined in Section Two.     These results should&#13;
not be taken as representative of the region as a whole or of any&#13;
particular  country.    The model,   as section two pointed out, is a&#13;
prototype. Its assumptions are hypothetical (as are the data used), and&#13;
are intended to demonstrate the scope and flexibility of the modeling&#13;
technique rather than its applicability to a particular country.&#13;
Consequently, these model results demonstrate which types of information&#13;
the model can provide, and how this information can be applied in policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
analysis.   The particular results are not relevant except to check the&#13;
direction of the predicted changes and the logic of the model.&#13;
The results from sample simulations of the prototype East&#13;
Africa agricultural pricing and marketing model are shown in Tables 4-1&#13;
through 4-5.    Table 4-1 summarizes the effect of a range of policy&#13;
instruments on the five objectives outlined in Section Three. Table 4-2&#13;
shows in more detail the results of simulations of alternative maize&#13;
pricing policies.    Table 4-3 compares the effects of changes in the&#13;
buying and selling prices for wheat.     Table 4-4 shows the results of&#13;
government policies to control formal maize market volume through&#13;
imports and exports and the results of increases in taxes on export&#13;
commodities. Table 4-5 shows the results of policies designed to equate&#13;
domestic prices of inputs and outputs to their border pricing equi-&#13;
valents and examines the effects of currency devaluations, both with and&#13;
without compensating adjustments in the fixed agricultural commodity&#13;
prices set by the government.&#13;
The prototype model reports the following information present-&#13;
ed in Tables 4-2 through 4-5:&#13;
1. Policy Variables - the fixed government farm prices,&#13;
consumer prices, export commodity taxes, currency&#13;
exchange rates, and import and export quotas that&#13;
affect the agricultural sector.&#13;
2. Prices - the equilibrium prices for each of the&#13;
informal markets, and farm prices for export commod-&#13;
ities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
3. Demand and Supply - the volume of consumption and&#13;
production for each agricultural commodity by each&#13;
major population sector (smallholders, large farm-&#13;
ers, and urban dwellers).&#13;
4. Imports and Exports - the volume of each agricultur-&#13;
al commodity and production factor entering or&#13;
leaving the country, and the net balance of payments&#13;
for agricultural commodities.&#13;
5. Government Agricultural Commodity Revenues - the net&#13;
revenues or losses to the government resulting from&#13;
its intervention in each market, and the net balance&#13;
for all agricultural commodities.&#13;
6. Factor Demand - The demand for fertilizer for each&#13;
crop.&#13;
7. Farm Profits - Farm cash incomes and profits from&#13;
each crop, for small and large farms.&#13;
Some of the detailed results from Tables 4-2 to 4-5 are sum-&#13;
marized in Table 4-1 as indices relating the five primary policy object-&#13;
ives to their base run value.    With the exception of the urban self-&#13;
sufficiency ratio, the indices are normalized in the base year to make&#13;
comparisons among policy simulations more straightforward. The budget-&#13;
ary gain or loss to the government is represented by the net government&#13;
revenues from agricultural commodities.    The agricultural balance of&#13;
payments represents the net foreign exchange revenue from agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
The urban self-sufficiency ratio indicates how much maize would have to&#13;
be imported, given current domestic production, to meet urban demand at&#13;
the official price.  This quantity of maize may not actually be import-&#13;
ed, however, because the government may prefer to eliminate excess urban&#13;
demand by means of an increase in the black market price for maize. The&#13;
index, therefore, reports the quantity of imports that would be required&#13;
to satisfy urban demand at the government's own selling price. A value&#13;
of this ratio greater than 100 indicates that there is a surplus of&#13;
maize at the official price which must be exported or stored.       Real&#13;
income per capita indicates the cash income of each group, adjusted for&#13;
changes in food prices. The economic efficiency index is the sum of the&#13;
net real income for the entire population and the net government revenue&#13;
and measures the change in the efficiency of resource allocation or&#13;
economic welfare.&#13;
The "base run", indicated in the first column of Tables 4-1&#13;
through 4-5, provides a point of reference with which the policy simu-&#13;
lations can be compared. The base run is the same for each table. In a&#13;
country-specific modeling exercise, it would represent the model's&#13;
approximation of the current state of the agricultural sector, with the&#13;
existing government policies in place. A comparison of the base run re-&#13;
sults with the current conditions of the country under study provides a&#13;
check on the accuracy of the model's parameters and the consistency of&#13;
its logic.&#13;
One -feature of the base run worth noting is that only a small&#13;
fraction of the food grains produced and consumed ever pass through the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
government-controlled markets. For example, in the base run only 7% of&#13;
the maize crop enters the formal market.     The great majority of food&#13;
crop production is consumed by the farm households themselves. Most of&#13;
the remainder is traded through rural, informal markets. Consequently,&#13;
some government policies will have an effect on the agriculture sector&#13;
as a whole that is much smaller than would be expected from generaliza-&#13;
tions based on government-controlled markets and procurement data alone.&#13;
We focus our discussion on only some of the results summarized&#13;
in Table 4-1 and on those policy objectives and interactions that help&#13;
to illustrate the value of such a modeling exercise in understanding&#13;
pricing and marketing outcomes in the agricultural sector.         (Those&#13;
interested in detailed results can of course look them up in Tables 4-2&#13;
to 4-5.)&#13;
4.1 Changing Procurement Prices&#13;
(a) Maize Procurement Price&#13;
Consider, for example, the effects of a 20 percent decrease in&#13;
the government procurement price for maize. The 12%-increase in govern-&#13;
ment revenues in this simulation illustrates the conceptual richness of&#13;
this type of modeling because it captures the interdependent effects on&#13;
government revenues from a number of sources. Why do total government&#13;
revenues increase when maize prices are cut?      The direct and obvious&#13;
answer is that government is now paying less for its maize and selling&#13;
it at the previous price thereby increasing net revenues.        But the&#13;
obvious answer is incorrect.    What in fact happens is that government&#13;
revenues from maize actually decline, because although the government's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
profit margin for maize is greater., its procurement volume has decreased&#13;
even more. Partial equilibrium techniques will readily give us this re-&#13;
sult.  However, in response to changing relative prices (and profits),&#13;
farmers convert some of their cropland from maize to wheat. As a re-&#13;
sult, there is less maize and more wheat in the formal market.  In fact,&#13;
it is the increased production and procurement of wheat that boosts&#13;
government revenues by diminishing the need for wheat imports, which are&#13;
heavily subsidized. Models that omit the linkages between production,&#13;
procurement, and demand systems for different crops would fail to&#13;
account for this effect.    By considering the supply and demand sides&#13;
simultaneously, models of this type can capture a number of important&#13;
interactions that would be overlooked by simpler analyses.&#13;
Next, consider the results of a 20% increase in the government&#13;
procurement price for maize.    The loss, of government revenues in this&#13;
case is much larger than one would expect as a result solely of the de-&#13;
crease in the maize profit margin. Much of the loss in revenues results&#13;
instead from a dramatic increase in formal market maize supplies that is&#13;
not completely offset by increases in formal market demand, making it&#13;
necessary for the government to store or export the excess maize at a&#13;
substantial loss.    At the chosen procurement price, formal market&#13;
supplies are moxe than sufficient to meet the demand from urban con-&#13;
sumers at the official selling price. The urban black market for maize&#13;
becomes very sm&amp;ll, and the government is faced with the prospect of&#13;
storing or exporting substantial quantities of maize.&#13;

exchange earnings also merits discussion.    A 20% decrease in the maize&#13;
procurement price increases net foreign exchange earnings by almost 2%1&#13;
a 20% increase in the same price also improves earnings by 5%.        The&#13;
reasons for these initially puzzling outcomes lie in the substitutions&#13;
occuring in production and in the operation of the urban black market&#13;
for maize. A decrease in the procurement price causes farmers to switch&#13;
into wheat, thereby reducing the need for wheat imports. The reduction&#13;
in maize production does not affect the balance of payments directly,&#13;
because demand is brought into line with the lower level of production&#13;
by means of an increase in the urban black market price. When the pro-&#13;
curement price is increased by 20%, however, the urban black market, as&#13;
noted above, disappears. Moreover, the government still has a maize&#13;
surplus available for export earnings.     In this case, therefore, the&#13;
change in maize production does have a direct effect on the balance of&#13;
payments which proves to be more than sufficient to offset the reduction&#13;
in wheat production (and hence increase in wheat imports) occurring as&#13;
farmers convert cropland to maize production.&#13;
Reading across the columns for the urban maize self-&#13;
sufficiency index, it is clear that the maize procurement price is the&#13;
most effective instrument for achieving this objective.      In the base&#13;
run, urban demand at the official selling pric, exceeds procurement by&#13;
33%. A decrease in the maize procurement price of 20% is sufficient to&#13;
eliminate official procurement altogether leaving urban consumers to be&#13;
supplied totally by imports or informal black markets, while a 20%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* 59 -&#13;
increase in the price results in official procurements three times as&#13;
great as urban demand.      No other   instrument has such a powerful&#13;
influence on the urban self-mufficiency ratios&#13;
With respect to the equity objective, the only households to&#13;
benefit from a reduction in the procurement price for maize are small-&#13;
holders. They benefit because they can take advantage of the now-higher&#13;
urban black market price for maize.    All pure consumers -- the rural&#13;
landless households and all urban households -- suffer because of higher&#13;
consumer price. This is especially true for the urban poor who suffer&#13;
a 5S   ioom in real income.   Unable to take advantage of urban black&#13;
market prices, large farm-households also suffer because of reduced&#13;
profits. Their profits from increased wheat production are not enough&#13;
to offset declining profits from decreased maize production which ham to&#13;
be sold via formal markets at reduced prices. The results are exactly&#13;
reversed for an increase in the maie procurement price.&#13;
The effect on the efficiency of resource allocation reflects&#13;
the effects on the real incomes of private agents and on government&#13;
revenues, Given the size of the smallholder group, 2    the direction of&#13;
the effect on overall resource allocation is usually the same as the&#13;
direction of the change in real incomes for omallholderms Unfortunate-&#13;
ly, the incomes of smallholders tend to move in the opposite direction&#13;
1/   In the hypothetical case we have assumed that the number of&#13;
smallholders  are nearly ten   times the number of large      farms and&#13;
cultivate just under 50% of the total area under food plus export&#13;
crops. This is clos to the actual proportion in Kenya, for examples&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
to those of the very poor.    A change in maize procurement prices thus&#13;
has the effect of influencing resource allocation and the real incomes&#13;
of the poorest -- the urban poor and the rural landless -- in opposite&#13;
directions.&#13;
(b) Wheat Procurement Price&#13;
The interaction between markets and supply systems is also&#13;
illustrated in the results for changes in the procurement price for&#13;
wheat.    One notable effect, is that when the procurement price is&#13;
decreased, government revenues decrease as well, and when the procure-&#13;
ment price is raised, government revenues increase. This arises because&#13;
wheat supply is highly elastic, and because changes in wheat supply have&#13;
an exaggerated effect on the budget, wheat imports (which must offset&#13;
production fluctuations) being heavily subsidized. In this case, there-&#13;
fore, the main budgetary effect of a change in the domestic procurement&#13;
price for wheat is felt indirectly through changes in the economy's need&#13;
to resort to highly-subsidized imports.&#13;
In general, changes in the procurement price for wheat have a&#13;
relatively limited impact on the agricultural economy. The changes in&#13;
government revenue, net foreign exchange earnings, equity, and effi-&#13;
ciency are all minor compared with those of other policy instruments.&#13;
This reflects the insignificance of wheat in the economy.     In the base&#13;
run, for example, wheat production (in tons) is only 3% of maize produc-&#13;
tion and wheat consumption is only 18% of maize consumption. Its tela-&#13;
tive unimportance notwithstanding, changes in the procurement price for&#13;
wheat still have a sizeable impact on urban maize self-sufficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
This reflects the substitution possibilities in production on large&#13;
farms.   Maize production is sensitive to changes in the procurement&#13;
price for wheat.&#13;
4.2 Changing Export Taxes&#13;
Export taxes have the expected effect since the interactions&#13;
between export crops (tea and coffee) and other crops are very limited&#13;
both in production and consumption. By assumption, export crops are not&#13;
grown on land that is suitable for the cultivation of food crops, nor&#13;
are they consumed domestically.    Nevertheless, the model allows us to&#13;
investigate the trade-offs between budget revenues and foreign exchange&#13;
earnings and between budget revenues and farm incomes.&#13;
An increase in the export tax of coffee from 2 to 10% of the&#13;
export price has a very substantial impact on government revenue. While&#13;
budget revenues increase over fivefold, net foreign exchange earnings&#13;
decrease by less than 10%.     This may appear to be an attractive and&#13;
relatively low-cost means of raising revenue. The increase in revenue,&#13;
however, is obtained at the expense of a 7% cut in the real incomes of&#13;
smallholders who are the predominant group in the population. A large&#13;
increase in government revenue is being achieved, therefore, at the&#13;
expense of a small decrease in incomes for a large part of the popula-&#13;
tion.&#13;
The reason for these results is that coffee and tea have only&#13;
small production substitution possibilities (we have assumed that the&#13;
land cannot be used for other crops), so that supply response is rela-&#13;
tively price inelastic. Raising export taxes while lowering prices paid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
to producers has only a small impact on production in the short run.&#13;
Lower prices maintained over a longer period could reduce production&#13;
considerably. Alternatively, if other crops can be grown on the land on&#13;
which export crops are grown -- as in the case of cotton in Sudan --&#13;
increased export taxes would reduce producer prices and, if substitution&#13;
possibilities are significant, reduce production, government revenues&#13;
and exports.&#13;
4.3 Border Pricing&#13;
A common policy prescription in African countries, where&#13;
domestic price distortions are deemed to be very large, when measured in&#13;
terms of international prices, is to recommend that domestic prices of&#13;
inputs and outputs be made to conform to their border price equiva-&#13;
lents.   Policies of this type will inevitably involve multiple price&#13;
changes.    The impact of such changes is difficult to measure with&#13;
simpler models, or (as we show later) if measurable could prove to be&#13;
wrong.    The model  developed here can, however,     easily handle the&#13;
simultaneous changes in multiple input and output prices which are&#13;
involved in border pricing recommendations.&#13;
Two simulations of border pricing policies were performed on&#13;
the model.    In the first border pricing simulation, tea and coffee&#13;
prices are set at the export parity price, the government's markup of&#13;
maize is set to just cover its expenses, and wheat buying and selling&#13;
prices are set at the import parity prices.      The maize price is not&#13;
changed, because maize is being neither imported nor exported. Because&#13;
the government has raised its buying price for wheat but not for maize,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
large farms produce more wheat and less maize. Because government maize&#13;
procurement drops, most of the urban maize demand is met through the&#13;
black market, at over twice the urban formal market selling price. The&#13;
fraction of urban maize demand met by the formal market (the maize self-&#13;
sufficiency ratio) drops from 66.8 % to 7.9 %.&#13;
The shrinkage of the formal maize market, a rise in the&#13;
government's selling price for wheat (to bring it to parity with the&#13;
import price), and a rise in the rural prices of maize and beans all&#13;
contribute to a drop in the real incomes of urban dwellers and the rural&#13;
landless. By contrast, the real incomes of smallholders and large farms&#13;
grow substantially due to the increases in producer prices, which are&#13;
great enough to outweigh the effects of consumer price increases for&#13;
these households.&#13;
The agricultural balance of payments improves because wheat&#13;
imports have been sharply reduced, and because tea and coffee exports&#13;
have increased slightly.&#13;
In both of the border pricing runs, the government nets no&#13;
revenue from its parastatal activities.    This results from the defini-&#13;
tion of border pricing:    namely, that the government conducts each of&#13;
its marketing operations at cost.&#13;
The second border pricing simulation is similar to the first,&#13;
except the government buying and selling prices for maize are adjusted&#13;
upward until the government selling price approximates the black market&#13;
price for maize. Only a small increase in the government maize procure-&#13;
ment is required to increase formal market supplies sufficiently to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
dramatically decrease black market maize demand.       As a result, the&#13;
formal market and black market maize selling prices meet at a price only&#13;
slightly greater than the formal market price in the first border&#13;
pricing run, but substantially smaller than the previous black market&#13;
price.&#13;
The results of this small shift in maize prices are substan-&#13;
tial.   As one would expect, the government maize price increase sub-&#13;
stantially improves the maize self-sufficiency ratio (from 7.9-99.6 %).&#13;
The increase in maize output from large farms implies a slight decrease&#13;
in wheat production and a corresponding rise in wheat imports and&#13;
fertilizer   imports  (because   net  agricultural  output   has  grown).&#13;
Consequently, the agricultural balance of payments index drops slightly,&#13;
from 109.3 in the first border pricing run to 107.2.&#13;
The most interesting shift, however, appears in real incomes.&#13;
Whereas the first border pricing run improved rural smallholder and&#13;
large farm real incomes, but decreased all other real incomes, the&#13;
second border pricing run improves all real incomes except those for the&#13;
rural landless group.    Real incomes for smallholders and large farms&#13;
increase because the effects of higher farm prices outweigh the effects&#13;
of higher consumer food prices.     Urban real incomes improve, despite&#13;
increases in urban prices for wheat and beans, because black market&#13;
maize prices and volumes have decreased substantially, lowering the&#13;
average urban maize price significantly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
4.4 Devaluation&#13;
Another common policy prescription designed to offset the&#13;
effects of overvalued exchange rates is devaluation.        In order to&#13;
demonstrate the ability of the model to treat multiple and simultaneous&#13;
policy interventions, we have simulated the effect of a currency&#13;
devaluation, which changes the prices of all tradeable commodities,&#13;
including food crops, export crops and some agricultural inputs.&#13;
Devaluation simulations were performed under two distinct sets of&#13;
assumptions. The first was that the currency would be devalued but that&#13;
fixed government prices for maize and wheat would remain unchanged in&#13;
domestic currency terms -- that is, the government does not pass on the&#13;
effects of the devaluation to producers and consumers of domestically&#13;
produced maize and wheat.   The increase in the prices of tradeables --&#13;
of tea, coffee and fertilizers -- is passed on.       The second set of&#13;
simulations assumes that the currency would be devalued and government&#13;
wheat and maize prices would be increased by the same amount, so that&#13;
the prices of these crops to producers and consumers remain constant in&#13;
terms of foreign exchange.   In other words, the prices of these commo-&#13;
dities and export crops and fertilizers are increased and the full&#13;
effect of the devaluation is passed on. In practice only a part of the&#13;
devaluation effects may be felt by producers and consumers -- that is,&#13;
only a proportion of the increase in the prices of export and food crops&#13;
or inputs may be passed on.      In the model any combination of price&#13;
changes faced by producers and consumers as a result of devaluation can&#13;
be analyzed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
The simulation results show that adjusting government maize&#13;
and wheat prices to keep pace with the devaluation -- passing on the&#13;
full effects of the devaluation - dramatically increases government&#13;
revenue and moves the economy to a position of maize self-sufficiency&#13;
(see last column).   The reason for this outcome is simple.   If govern-&#13;
ment food prices are allowed to increase to adjust to devaluation,&#13;
demand will fall and production will rise.      The production of export&#13;
crops increases, but because they do not compete for land with food&#13;
crops, this is done without a reduction in food crop production.&#13;
Because the prices of non-tradeable farm inputs (such as labor) have&#13;
declined relative to prices for tradeable commodities,       farm output&#13;
increases.   Similarly, because food prices have increased relative to&#13;
labor rates, demand for food crops declines. The resulting increase in&#13;
maize supply is sufficient to produce a net surplus, and wheat imports&#13;
are sharply cut, thereby improving net government revenues.&#13;
If, on the other hand, government and procurement prices are&#13;
kept artificially low relative to the devalued prices (second to last&#13;
column), the demand for maize and wheat will increase and production&#13;
will drop simultaneously relative to other commodities.     Consequently,&#13;
the government must import greater volumes of wheat at greater rates of&#13;
subsidy and excess urban demand for maize must be eliminated either&#13;
through additional imports or through adjustments in the black market&#13;
price with consequent lose in government revenues.&#13;
Apart from these differences, the two devaluation packages&#13;
have very similar effects on other government objectives. For example,&#13;

- 67 A -&#13;
both packages increase the real incomes of smallholders by around 20%,&#13;
improve the allocation of resources significantly, and contribute to net&#13;
foreign exchange earnings.&#13;
Although we have only investigated a very small number of&#13;
possible policy packages, it is clear that a devaluation which is&#13;
allowed to influence all tradeable prices, including those controlled by&#13;
the government, emerges as the most desirable policy change from most&#13;
perspectives.   It increases government revenues substantially, it im-&#13;
proves the balance of payments, it moves the economy to a position of&#13;
maize self-sufficiency, it increases farm incomes, and it improves&#13;
resource allocation.   The only group to lose noticeably are the rural&#13;
landless whose purchasing power from a fixed labor income has obviously&#13;
decreased. Note that urban consumers, although also existing on fixed&#13;
nominal incomes, do not suffer a loss of real income despite the effect&#13;
of the devaluation on consumer prices.    This apparently impossible re-&#13;
sult arises because the post-devaluation price of maize to urban con-&#13;
sumers is still less than the pre-devaluation, black market price of&#13;
maize. In this case, therefore, devaluation, which usually reduces the&#13;
real incomes of those with fixed nominal incomes, has the opposite&#13;
effect because of supply-side developments.      That is, the increased&#13;
supply of maize occurring as a result of devaluation effectively&#13;
eliminates the urban black market, thereby ensuring lower prices at the&#13;
margin for urban consumers.&#13;
In interpreting these results, however, three caveats should&#13;
be kept in mind.   First, we have not considered the effect of devalua-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
tion on other parts of the economy.     Second, we have assumed that the&#13;
change in the relative prices of tradeables and nontradeables is&#13;
sustained. We have not allowed for the erosion of a nominal devaluation&#13;
as domestic inflation in excess of international inflation undermines&#13;
the original gain in international competitiveness. Clearly, the model&#13;
presented here has nothing to say on either of these points. And third,&#13;
we have not considered the effect of an increase in the prices of&#13;
nonfood, tradeable consumer goods.      This would tend to reduce real&#13;
incomes for all groups.    It should, however, be possible to allow for&#13;
this effect within the present structure of the model.&#13;
4.5 Comparison with Simpler Approaches&#13;
The analysis of export taxes offers an interesting example of&#13;
the value of models that incorporate the possibilities for substitution&#13;
in production and consumption. These possibilities are very limited in&#13;
the case of coffee.    We have, therefore, also computed the change in&#13;
budget revenues and foreign exchange earnings by means of the consumer&#13;
surplus/producer surplus approach. In this approach we have, therefore,&#13;
calculated the effect on budget revenues and foreign exchange revenues&#13;
by simply looking at areas under the supply curve for coffee.        This&#13;
method requires construction/estimation of only one supply curve.&#13;
Nevertheless, the results of this approach for this simulation are&#13;
remarkably similar to those obtained from the full model:&#13;

from 2% to 10%. Clearly, in this case, it makes very little difference&#13;
to the estimate of the budgetary effect whether one uses the full model&#13;
or the simple model.   It does make a small difference, however, as far&#13;
as foreign exchange earnings are concerned because the reduced revenue&#13;
from coffee exports is partially offset by the reduction in imports of&#13;
fertilizer. This effect is not captured by the simple model. Moreover,&#13;
the conclusion -- that the simple model produces results similar to the&#13;
full model -- becomes less tenable as the range of substitution&#13;
possibilities between crops in production increases.     In cases where&#13;
export crops compete for land with other crops (cotton, groundnuts,&#13;
oilseeds, sugarcane, and tobacco are important examples in East Africa)&#13;
there will be significant differences between the simple and full model&#13;
for both government revenues and foreign exchange.     The simple model&#13;
breaks down entirely when the analyst wants to investigate the&#13;
consequences of simultaneous intervention in more than one market.&#13;
Application of the "simple model" to the analysis of deval-&#13;
uation illustrates the value of the "full model" when more than one&#13;
price is changed,.  Consider the case in which the government does not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
pass on the effect of the devaluation to producers and consumers of&#13;
maize and wheat.    That is, 'devaluation' is assumed to influence the&#13;
farmgate prices of tea, coffee, and fertilizer but nothing else.      We&#13;
have calculated the effects of this policy change on budget revenues and&#13;
foreign exchange for the 'simple model" by focusing exclusively .on own-&#13;
price effects.    That is, the effect of a change in the price of&#13;
fertilizer is captured by examining only the demand curve for fertilizer&#13;
and observing the change in the quantity demanded as the fertilizer&#13;
price is changed.    The effect of this change on budget revenues and&#13;
foreign exchange is then recorded. The process is repeated for the tea&#13;
supply curve and the tea price and so on.      The results of the three&#13;
independent calculations -- for fertilizer, tea, and coffee -- and an&#13;
estimate of the increased cost of wheat imports are then summed to&#13;
arrive at the simple model's approximation of the consequences of&#13;
simultaneous price changes in three markets. These results can then be&#13;
compared with those of the "full model" where these simultaneous price&#13;
changes are treated jointly:&#13;

Index                   Index&#13;
Base Run                            100.0                    100.0&#13;
Simple model                        179.9                     87.3&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
In the simple model, devaluation raises the prices of coffee&#13;
and tea.   The resulting increase in coffee and tea production boosts&#13;
both balance of payments and government revenue.     Devaluation involves&#13;
an increase in the import prices of wheat and fertilizer which, in&#13;
combination with the coffee and tea export effects, results in an 80%&#13;
increase in balance of payments and a 13% decrease in government reve-&#13;
nues.   In the full model, however, the effects of devaluation are of&#13;
entirely different proportions. The full model shows only a 43% rise in&#13;
balance of payments and a drastic 84% drop in government revenues. The&#13;
full model treats the price effects jointly rather than separately. For&#13;
example, although coffee and tea prices have increased, fertilizer costs&#13;
have risen also, tending to moderate the dramatic coffee and tea produc-&#13;
tion increases forecast by the simple model.    The fertilizer price in-&#13;
crease also contributes to a decrease in wheat production and a rise in&#13;
wheat imports, which are quite costly in terms of both government subsi-&#13;
dies and foreign exchange.     Finally, whereas the logic of the simple&#13;
model requires that the rise in fertilizer prices will result in a drop&#13;
in fertilizer demand, the full model finds that the expansion of coffee&#13;
and tea production actually spurs a dramatic increase in fertilizer&#13;
imports.   Because the simple model treats price changes singly rather&#13;
than jointly, it both exaggerates the foreign exchange benefits and&#13;
underestimates the government revenue costs of devaluation.&#13;
These comparisons suggest that the quantitative results, and&#13;
sometimes even the qualitative results, of simple models can be quite&#13;
misleading.   Of course, when using the simple model, the experienced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
analyst will try to take account of the various interactions that are&#13;
treated explicitly in the full model.     But then the approach, and the&#13;
data requirements, begin to approximate those of the full model. More-&#13;
over, we had considerable difficulty in deciding exactly what an analyst&#13;
using the simple model would assume about substitution possibilities in&#13;
production and consumption and about the operation of markets. In fact,&#13;
we abandoned this effort when it came to analyzing the alternative de-&#13;
valuation package in which the effects of the devaluation are passed on&#13;
to consumers and producers of wheat and maize. Now five producer prices&#13;
and two consumer prices are changing.     We were unable to arrive at a&#13;
reasonable procedure to handle these price changes and yet maintain the&#13;
simplicity of the simple approach. We conclude, therefore, that where&#13;
one is investigating single-price changes and there is good reason to&#13;
believe that substitution possibilities are limited -- the coffee ex-&#13;
ample in our model -- the simple model is to be preferred. Where one is&#13;
investigating multiple price changes or where, regardless of the number&#13;
of price changes, substitution possibilities are thought to be impor-&#13;
tant, the analyst would be well advised to base his policy recommen-&#13;
dations on the results of the full model.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
DATA REQUIREMENTS&#13;
In this Annex, we describe the data necessary for the&#13;
construction of the model discussed in the text. We emphasize, however,&#13;
that the model provides a framework in which the analyst can use the&#13;
existing data, whatever their reliability, to best possible effect. We&#13;
also note that the structure of the model is as important as the&#13;
particular numerical values assigned to the parameters.      That is, the&#13;
analyst must investigate the institutional arrangements influencing the&#13;
markets to be modelled.&#13;
QUANTITY RELATIONS&#13;
The   model   requires   information   on  commodity   balances.&#13;
Information   on  production,   consumption,  imports   or   exports  and&#13;
inventories (if any) are required for each of the major crops and&#13;
fertilizer (or other inputs) for a selection of years.     In some cases,&#13;
consumption may have to be measured as a residual. Where possible, this&#13;
information should be disaggregated by region and by type of producer&#13;
(e.g. smallholder or estate).   The quantity purchased by the marketing&#13;
board (if any) should also be reported. Table 1 illustrates the type of&#13;
information required for each crop in the model.     In the case of some&#13;
export crops, domestic consumption may be negligible and export data&#13;
instead of import data would be required.&#13;

Information of this kind is usually presented in official agricultural&#13;
and trade statistics and is generally reproduced in Bank agricultural&#13;
sector reports. Where this information is not immediately available in&#13;
published sources, it will be necessary to rely on semi-official and&#13;
private estimates. For the major crops in most countries, it should not&#13;
be too difficult to arrive at reasonable commodity balances. 1/&#13;
PRICE RELATIONS&#13;
The manner in which prices are determined is critical.       For&#13;
some crops, prices may be controlled at virtually every stage of the&#13;
market chain.   For other crops, prices may be subject to the forces of&#13;
supply and demand.   The operation of the market should be described in&#13;
as much detail as possible for every output and input included in the&#13;
-----------------------------------&#13;
1/   This is not always the case because official statistics sometimes&#13;
fail to "match up".   This may not be totally due to statistical errors&#13;
but due to efforts on the part of authorities to hide losses or&#13;
leakages.&#13;

In Malawi, maize is neither exported nor imported on a regular basis.&#13;
This is revealed clearly in Tables 2 and 3 where the export and import&#13;
parity prices at local markets bracket the local price.      In the event&#13;
that maize is exported (say, after a good harvest), Table 2 would allow&#13;
the calculation of the loss incurred by ADMARC, the state procurement&#13;
agency.   Similarly, in the event of a bad maize harvest, Table 3 shows&#13;
the cost incurred if ADMARC has to resort to imports. To complete the&#13;
picture, it is also necessary to know the price "chain" from domestic&#13;
producers to domestic consumers. This chain would allow the analyst to&#13;
compute the gain or loss incurred by ADMARC on its purchase of domestic&#13;
maize for sale at home. This information can often be reduced from the&#13;
accounts of the marketing agency. - Table 4, for example, shows the&#13;
losses incurred by ADMARC in recent years. This table suggests that on&#13;
average the loss (-h in equation 4b) per short ton procured in 1976 was&#13;
40 Kwacha.   Given ADMARC's policy of maintaining a constant buying and&#13;
selling price throughout the country (see Tables 2 and 3), an analysis&#13;
of ADMARC's activities (and hence production and demand) by region would&#13;
be of potential policy interest.&#13;
Finally, time series information on price trends, although not&#13;
absolutely necessary, is useful in placing current events in their&#13;
historical  context.    Trends in the relation of domestic to border&#13;
prices, in the relation of output to input prices, in the relation of&#13;
1/ Where such data are totally unavailable then the marketing costs and&#13;
margins have to be assumed.   The model can still be run in a "parametric&#13;
mode" to see what is likely to happen under varying assumptions on&#13;
marketing costs, margins and prices.&#13;

output prices among substitutes, in the relation between official buying&#13;
and selling prices, and in the relation of output prices to the prices&#13;
of consumer goods are all of interest and provide substantial&#13;
information to supplement model results.&#13;

The price information described in this section is usually&#13;
provided in agricultural sector reports. More specialized studies, such&#13;
as exercises to measure nominal or effective protection, domestic&#13;
resource costs, and analyses of marketing chains, also contain price&#13;
information of this kind.     In the absence of published information,&#13;
reasonable data on prices, margins, and marketing costs can be obtained&#13;
during field work.    This is a worthwhile exercise regardless of the&#13;
availability of published material because it increases the analyst's&#13;
familiarity with market structure.&#13;
Links to the Model&#13;
The data requirements described in the sections on Quantity&#13;
Relations and Price Relations allow the analyst to construct the&#13;
systematic set of accounting equations depicted in Section 2.3 of the&#13;
main text.    In particular, this information should be sufficient to&#13;
construct the quantity equations (equations 3a, 4a, 5a, 6a and 7a) and&#13;
the price equations    (3b, 4b, 4c, 6b, 6c,     and 7b).    The variables&#13;
measures include exports (E), supply (S), demand (D) and imports (M) for&#13;
the quantity equations,    and procurement prices    (p),   export prices&#13;
(pe), export taxes (t), administrative costs (a), marketing board&#13;
surpluses (h), controlled consumer prices (pu), import prices (p m), and&#13;
free market prices (p r).  Information on urban black market prices (Pb)&#13;
would also be of value.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

BEHAVIORAL RELATIONS&#13;
Equations 1 and 2 of the main text describe the behavioral&#13;
relations of the model.    On the supply side, we are interested in the&#13;
profit function (equation la), land allocation (equation lb), supply&#13;
(equation le) and input demand (equation lg).    And on the demand side,&#13;
we need information on demand (equation 2a) and utility (equation 2b).&#13;
The basic sources of information are farm management studies for the&#13;
supply side and consumer budget studies for the demand side.           If&#13;
detailed farm management and expenditure surveys are available these&#13;
behavioral relationships can be estimated directly. More often than not&#13;
such data are unavailable or the analysis proves to be cumbersome.&#13;
Preferred and short-cut methods of estimation are described below.&#13;
(i) Supply Side (equation 1)&#13;
In some countries, farm management studies can be used to&#13;
estimate. a profit   function  (equation   la)  directly.   This  is the&#13;
preferred approach.     For this exercise, one needs observations on&#13;
profits, factor shares, output prices, input prices for variable factors&#13;
(e.g. fertilizer), and quantities for fixed factors (e.g. land).      The&#13;
unit of observation is the farm and there must be sufficient variation&#13;
in prices among farms to allow econometric estimation.     Unfortunately,&#13;
cross-sectional data do not usually exhibit substantial price variation.&#13;
In the event that econometric estimation proves infeasible,&#13;
farm management data (of the type often available in project feasibility&#13;
studies) can be used as follows. First, if we assume that technology is&#13;
characterized by a Cobb-Douglas production function and that there are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
two variable inputs, labor and fertilizer, and one fixed factor, land,&#13;
then the corresponding profit function is:&#13;
ln 1 = y + E aj ln (p/p) + ln A                             (1)&#13;
where the log of profits (I) is shown to be a function of the price of&#13;
the variable inputs (pj) relative to the price of output (p) and the&#13;
quantity of land (A).     The supply curve consistent with this profit&#13;
function is:&#13;
Q = T (1 - E a )                                            (2)&#13;
and the demand functions for the variable inputs are:&#13;
-a0 IIp&#13;
Q  =                                                       (3)&#13;
i PJ = 1,2&#13;
Assume that the analyst has information on farm output (Q),&#13;
inputs used (Q) and prices (p, pj).     The system of equations 1-3 thus&#13;
comprises four equations and four unknowns --   y, a and II.   The system&#13;
can be solved, therefore, to obtain the unobserved parameters and&#13;
profits.&#13;
There are two flaws with this approach.     First, there may be&#13;
errors in the data.    Second, the true relations may not be adequately&#13;
captured by a Cobb-Douglas specification of techology. These flaws can&#13;
be partially overcome by taking advantage of other data sources and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
allowing some flexibility when solving the system.      For example, from&#13;
the above equations, it can be shows that the short-run elasticity of&#13;
supply with respect to own-price equals       - (al + Y )     Independent&#13;
estimates of supply response can be used, therefore, to check the&#13;
plausibility of estimates derived from the analysis of the profit&#13;
function.&#13;
Assume that we have a good independent estimate of short-run&#13;
supply response which differs substantially from the derived estimate&#13;
(that is,  - (a1 + a2)).    This may be because the data underlying the&#13;
profit function are unreliable.    We may wish to resolve the system of&#13;
equations but   in such a way that      - (a, + Y     is constrained to&#13;
approximate the independently estimated elasticity. One procedure is to&#13;
solve the system using nonlinear programming techniques and minimizing&#13;
an objective function of the form:&#13;
*   2                  *   2&#13;
Min L +61    2i-i   Ii     2 +&#13;
+ ^3'u [         "    + 64 I'A -A      2                    (4)&#13;
A&#13;
* 2&#13;
+ 5 [1T* T&#13;
where the asterisk indicates the value of the variable used in the&#13;
analysis of the profit function and ai is the independently observed&#13;
elasticity.   If we think that the independently observed elasticity is&#13;
more reliable that the other information then we should assign a higher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 99 -&#13;
cost to any departure from that value.     Therefore, we place a larger&#13;
coefficient  (6)  on the term showing the percentage departure from the&#13;
observed  value   for   this  elasticity  than   on  the   other  terms.&#13;
Minimization of this objective function will yield a set of values&#13;
(those without the bars) that are consistent with the (assumed) Cobb-&#13;
Douglas technology and which depart from observed variables in&#13;
accordance with our prior assessment of the reliability of those&#13;
variables.   The model would then be based on this new set of derived&#13;
parameters.  In arriving at this set, we would have made maximum use of&#13;
available  data   and,  moreover,   allowed   for  varying  degrees   of&#13;
reliability. 1/&#13;
If this procedure yields unacceptable departures from observed&#13;
variables, it may be concluded that technology cannot be adequately&#13;
captured by a Cobb-Douglas representation.   In this event, it would be&#13;
appropriate to experiment with alternative functional forms.&#13;
This example of a short-cut method illustrates the basic idea&#13;
in a simple case.      The same principle applies, however,    for more&#13;
complicated cases.    For example,   if two crops are substitutes in&#13;
production, it would be necessary to treat them jointly and also to&#13;
allow   for  the  possibility   of  reallocating   land  between   them.&#13;
Nevertheless, the basic information needs are the same.      The analyst&#13;
requires information on inputs, outputs, areas, and prices.    This sort&#13;
1/   Since the present exercise is based on hypothetical data, this&#13;
approach was not used.   In has, however, been used by Messrs. Braverman&#13;
and Hammer in their work in Senegal. This approach is also being used&#13;
in our current work on Malawi.&#13;

The data presented in Table 5 are drawn from several sources and in some&#13;
cases are mission estimates.&#13;
(ii) Demand Side (equation 2)&#13;
The estimation/construction of the demand side of the model&#13;
involves similar procedures.    The basic equation for demand is of the&#13;
form:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
Ei/Y   a + biln Y + EJYi    lniPi                           (5)&#13;
where E /Y is the share of expenditure on the ith food crop, Y is total&#13;
income,  and P    is the price of the jth consumption good.         Cross&#13;
sectional household budget surveys allow the estimation of equation 5&#13;
provided the sample contains sufficient price variation. Alternatively,&#13;
independent estimates of demand elasticities can be used to derive the&#13;
parameters  in  equation  5.    This  can be done    from  the  following&#13;
relations:&#13;
Cy = 1 + biY/Ei                                             (6)&#13;
eii     1 + yij  Y/Ei                                       (7)&#13;
ij= Yij    Y/Ei                                             (8)&#13;
where   £y, eii, and eij  are the income, own-price, and cross - price&#13;
elasticities respectively.&#13;
For  basic   foodstuffs,   international  estimates   of  demand&#13;
responses may be sufficiently accurate in the event that country-&#13;
specific estimates are unavailable.    In this case, however, it may be&#13;
appropriate to apply the method described for the supply side so that&#13;
greater reliance can be placed on the information considered most&#13;
reliable. For Kenya, for example, estimates of income elasticities are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
unavailable but not price elasticities, it would be appropriate to&#13;
assign a lower weight in the objective function to departures from the&#13;
parameters derived from these elasticities than to departures from the&#13;
parameters derived from the income elasticities.&#13;
ADDING-UP RELATIONS&#13;
The analyst also requires information on number of households,&#13;
number of farms, etc. so that the micro relationships describing supply&#13;
and demand behavior can be aggregated.       The output of, say, maize&#13;
derived by scaling up the output produced on each of the representative&#13;
farms must match the total output derived from the aggregate commodity&#13;
balances.   A similar point holds for the demand side.      This matching&#13;
cannot be expected to be exact.     Further adjustments may be required,&#13;
therefore, either in the micro supply and demand relations or in the&#13;
aggregate commodity balances. Again it may be useful to assign weights&#13;
to departures from observed values for the different variables and use&#13;
the minimization procedure.    At the end of this exercise, the analyst&#13;
should have a consistent set of accounts for the agricultural sector at&#13;
both the micro and the sectoral levels as well as between the micro and&#13;
sectoral levels. Development of agricultural accounts is, of course, a&#13;
useful exercise whether or not one wishes to undertake a modelling&#13;
exercise.&#13;
The information requirements -- number of farms, size of&#13;
households, etc. -- for the adding-up relations should be available in&#13;
such sources as Population Census, Agricultural Census, Consumer Budget&#13;
Surveys and National Employment Surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
Adding up relations are also required to derive the effects of&#13;
policy on the five objectives discussed in the text.     The information&#13;
required for consideration of the equity objective is provided&#13;
immediately by the estimates of compensating variation. For the revenue&#13;
objective, however, the analyst needs to know the aggregate effect on&#13;
all 'taxed and subsidized commodities as well as the levels of tax and&#13;
subsidy.    This   latter,  of  course,  is  obtained   from  the  price&#13;
relations.    Similarly,  for the balance of payments objective,     the&#13;
analyst -must add up the effects of any price change on all affected&#13;
imports and exports.  The self-sufficiency ratio for maize, on the other&#13;
hand, is obtained immediately from a comparison of aggregate production&#13;
and consumption whereas the measure of efficiency requires the summation&#13;
of compensating variation for each representative household group and&#13;
total revenue. None of these relations requires additional information,&#13;
however,.  All the information required for their deviation is already&#13;
contained in the model.&#13;
We can summarize the data requirements of the model as follows:&#13;

The table shows likely sources of information.      The analyst does not&#13;
need all these sources.      For example, Consumer Budget Surveys and&#13;
Studies of Demand Response are alternative sources.&#13;
With one exception, all the equations in the text can be&#13;
derived if numerical values are available for the equations cited in the&#13;
table.   The exception is the leakage equation (equations 4e and 4f).&#13;
Information will not be directly available on leakages from the formal&#13;
to the informal system.     Nevertheless, leakages can be an important&#13;
feature of agricultural commodity markets and should not be ignored.&#13;
Some progress, however, can be made by a careful analysis of official&#13;
procurement data since it is official procurement that will be most&#13;
sensitive  to  the  amount   of  leakage.    An  historical  analysis  of&#13;
procurement should enable the analyst to put reasonable bounds on the&#13;
parameters of the leakage functions.&#13;
Finally, it is worth noting the obvious point that a model&#13;
allows maximum potential for sensitivity analysis.      If the estimated&#13;
leakage function or maize response function is thought to be unreliable&#13;
the analyst can explore the consequences of alternative estimates in&#13;
great  detail.    This  is true   of other   demand,  supply and market&#13;

parameters also.    By means of this process, it should be possible to&#13;
distinguish between relatively robust policy conclusions and those that&#13;
are highly sensitive to particular parameter estimates.&#13;

            Agricultural pricing and marketing policies
            in an African context : a framework for analysis
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The paper describes an analytical
            framework designed to address some of the important
            agricultural pricing issues that frequently arise in many
            African countries. The paper contains a description of
            producer, consumer, and marketing characteristics common to
            African countries, presents an analytical framework designed
            to capture these characteristics, outlines the policy uses
            of the framework, and discusses a series of policy results
            derived from a prototype application of the framework. Two
            annexes complete the paper. The first contains a rigorous,
            mathematical description of the model. The second describes
            data requirements and potential sources.
