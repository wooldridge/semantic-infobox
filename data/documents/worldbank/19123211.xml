&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success&#13;
factorsâ&#128;&#153; selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the African&#13;
Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Over the past 20 years, Sub-Saharan Africa has made significant progress in extending access to improved water supply&#13;
and sanitation. But this expansion of coverage has been uneven across countries and subsectors and overall falls short&#13;
of the ambitious targets to which governments have committed (whether national or MDG targets).&#13;
&#13;
The eThekwini declaration, the Tunis Action Plan, and the Sharm el-Sheikh commitments make an urgent call to get&#13;
countries back on-track for the water supply and sanitation MDG targets and to develop a deeper understanding of how&#13;
progress can be accelerated in the water and sanitation sectors.&#13;
&#13;
Improvements in access to water supply and sanitation contribute to the Millennium Development Goals on environment,&#13;
health, education, food security, gender equality, and poverty alleviation. Access to water supply and sanitation&#13;
directly impacts labor productivity, illness, school attendance, and womenâ&#128;&#153;s personal security. Reducing health care&#13;
costs, increasing school attendance, freeing time for productive activity, and ensuring safety for women have notable&#13;
economic benefits.&#13;
&#13;
For these reasons, the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round&#13;
of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) on water supply and sanitation, to throw light on the political, institutional, and&#13;
financial factors which underpin progress in the sector. The World Bank, Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), and the&#13;
African Development Bank implemented this task in close partnership with UNICEF, WHO, and the governments of 32&#13;
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.a&#13;
&#13;
The regional synthesis report demonstrates the extent to which three factorsâ&#128;&#148;political stability, sector leadership, and&#13;
aid modalitiesâ&#128;&#148;underpin progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS).&#13;
&#13;
Political stability has heavily influenced progress in improving access to WSS service with low-income stable countries&#13;
outperforming low-income fragile and resource-rich countries:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	     making greater increases in coverage across subsectors;&#13;
â&#128;¢	     reducing open defecation more markedly in rural sanitation;&#13;
â&#128;¢	     being more successful in keeping up with population growth in urban water supply; and&#13;
â&#128;¢	     achieving more equitable access, with a smaller gap in coverage between the richest and poorest segments of&#13;
       the population.&#13;
&#13;
But, in addition, sector leadership, aid flows, and aid modalities have been critical factors in driving this progress.&#13;
&#13;
An estimated $25 billion dollars of aid has been channeled to water supply and sanitation over the past 20 years. The&#13;
good progress of low-income stable countries has been assisted by their receiving three times more aid than low-income&#13;
fragile countries and two times more aid than resource-rich countries, per unserved person.&#13;
&#13;
However, the relative strength of low-income stable country performance is not only the result of greater funding but&#13;
the nature of that funding. As aid modalities have shifted from donor-driven projects to country-led programmatic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a&#13;
    With the newly formed Republic of South Sudan on July 9, 2011, this is 33 country governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                Pathways to Progress: Transitioning to Country-Led Service Delivery Pathways to Meet Africaâ&#128;&#153;s Water Supply and Sanitation Targets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
approaches to service deliveryâ&#128;&#148;along the Paris Principles for aid effectivenessâ&#128;&#148;line ministries have increasingly used&#13;
core government systems (public financial management systems and decentralized service delivery capacity) and private&#13;
sector capacity in the wider economy.&#13;
&#13;
The front-runners, among the group of low-income stable group of countries, have well functioning service delivery&#13;
pathways that translate inputs (finance) into outcomes (coverage) anchored in core government systemsâ&#128;&#148;greatly&#13;
extending their reach and rate of implementation capacity.&#13;
&#13;
The progress made by low-income stable countries is thus the product of strong service delivery pathways, stability, and&#13;
support from development partners. The progress has itself made these sectors more attractive propositions for further&#13;
investment both from domestic and external sources. This is the virtuous cycle required to incrementally close the annual&#13;
shortfall in capital investment of US$6 billion needed to meet national targets.&#13;
&#13;
The positive trajectory of low-income stable countriesâ&#128;&#148;many of which have suffered conflict in the pastâ&#128;&#148;helps to&#13;
define principles for the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s senior managers and their development partners to transition to efficient country-led&#13;
service delivery. This is complemented with specific detailed country priorities set out in the 32 individual country status&#13;
overview papers.&#13;

&amp;#12;                         Pathways to Progress: Transitioning to Country-Led Service Delivery Pathways to Meet Africaâ&#128;&#153;s Water Supply and Sanitation Targets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).e Based on the extensive&#13;
in-country diagnostics, analysis, and stakeholder consultations, the CSO2 provides these insights for 32 countries in SSA,&#13;
for which there are separate individual country reports.f&#13;
&#13;
This document is the regional synthesis of the 32 country status overviews which collectively account for 95 percent&#13;
of SSAâ&#128;&#153;s population and over 90 percent of GDP. The report highlights the most important trends, challenges, and&#13;
proposed actions for achieving improved water supply and sanitation (WSS) services across Sub-Saharan Africa. The&#13;
opportunities for progress are identified based on:&#13;
&#13;
1.	 Understanding trends: The report analyzes regional performance, the relative progress of individual countries, and&#13;
    progress of groups of countries classified by a combination of political and economic factors. The report considers&#13;
    separately the four water and sanitation subsectors in each country: rural water supply; urban water supply; rural&#13;
    sanitation; and, urban sanitation.&#13;
2.	 Identifying the challenge: For each country and subsector, the CSO2 explores the links between inputs (finance)&#13;
    and outcomes (coverage) through the lens of a â&#128;&#152;service delivery pathwayâ&#128;&#153;, which is systematically assessed using the&#13;
    CSO2 scorecard,g to identify the major barriers that still constrain performance in each subsector. The scorecards&#13;
    assess three pillars of the service delivery pathway and within each pillar three key building blocks:&#13;

        service delivery: three building blocks which relate to enabling services, three which relate to developing new services, and three which relate to sustaining&#13;
        services. Each building block is assessed against specific indicators and scored from 1 to 3 accordingly.&#13;

Changing Political and Economic Context for Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Service Delivery&#13;
&#13;
     Increasing domestic resources, national ownership, and stability have opened the space for African&#13;
     governments to take charge of their water supply and sanitation sectors and develop sustainable&#13;
     service delivery pathways.&#13;
&#13;
     Line ministries for WSS have the opportunity to engage with ministries of finance to increase budget&#13;
     allocations, to make use of core government systems and economywide capacity, while developing&#13;
     their capacity as sector coordinators and leaders.&#13;
&#13;
     The CSO2 assists governments and donors as they transition to the new environment, providing&#13;
     analyses of coverage, investments, and service delivery pathways, and identifying critical needs and&#13;
     solutions within and between countries and subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
The changing political and economic context in Africa has opened up an unparalleled opportunity for a renaissance in&#13;
country-led service delivery in water supply and sanitation. Over the past decade, three fundamental transformations&#13;
have created a new, favorable environment for governments to take ownership of the water and sanitation sector and&#13;
accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs):&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Economic growth and a widening tax base, debt relief, and rising levels of budget support are increasing the resources&#13;
   available in domestic budgets.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Subsidence in the magnitude of armed conflict has created a more predictable, stable environment for sustainable&#13;
   state action and opened up prospects for further debt relief and peace dividends.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and Sector-Wide Approaches (SWAp) have shifted the aid environment&#13;
   towards supporting greater national ownership and coordination, as well as for developing government capacity&#13;
   for this.&#13;
&#13;
Line ministries responsible for water supply and sanitation face a new era of greater responsibility, greater freedom&#13;
of action, and potentially more domestic resources. The challenge is to transition to this new environment by building&#13;
countriesâ&#128;&#153; capability to pro-actively manage nationwide service delivery programs to make use of core government&#13;
systems (for example, public financial management systems, national procurement systems, and decentralized service&#13;
delivery) and the wider economy (private sector goods and services as well as community management).&#13;
&#13;
Development partners, now less involved in the implementation of their own discrete projects, are also in a new situation&#13;
in which they have to pay more attention to sectorwide questions such as harmonizing implementation modalities and&#13;
finding the right balance between technical assistance and financing country-led investment programs.&#13;
&#13;
To fill their emerging new roles, both governments and development partners need more comprehensive information:&#13;
Not only a detailed overview of access and investment trends, but also a systematic understanding of the capability of&#13;
the sector to absorb finance, and deliver and sustain outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
The CSO2 assists governments and donors as they transition to the new environment, providing analyses of coverage,&#13;
investments, and service delivery pathways, and identifying critical needs and proposing solutions within and between&#13;
countries and subsectors.&#13;

&amp;#12;                    Pathways to Progress: Transitioning to Country-Led Service Delivery Pathways to Meet Africaâ&#128;&#153;s Water Supply and Sanitation Targets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Understanding Trends: Significant Progress but Still Marked by Disparities&#13;
and Falling Short of Targets Overall&#13;
&#13;
    Progress has been made in both water supply and sanitation coverage but meeting the MDG targets&#13;
    will need eight times more people to gain access to sanitation every year, and four times more people&#13;
    to gain access to water supply, compared to past trends.&#13;
&#13;
    Progress in increasing access is best explained by a combination of political and economic factors: Low-&#13;
    income stable countries have made greater increases in coverage than resource-rich and low-income&#13;
    fragile countries.&#13;
&#13;
    Development assistance has played an important role in advancing coverage both in terms of volumes&#13;
    and modalities of aid.&#13;
&#13;
    The good progress of low-income stable countries has been assisted by their receiving three times&#13;
    more aid than low-income fragile countries and two times more aid than resource-rich countries, per&#13;
    unserved person.&#13;
&#13;
    Low-income stable countries making most progress have capitalized on harmonized and aligned aid&#13;
    modalities to successfully transition to more programmatic, â&#128;&#152;country-ledâ&#128;&#153; forms of service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
SSA as a whole has made significant progress in extending access to improved water supply and sanitation. But this&#13;
expansion of coverage has been uneven across countries and subsectors and, overall, falls short of the ambitious targets&#13;
to which governments have committed (whether national or MDG targets).&#13;
&#13;
Across the participating countries, coverage of improved water supply has risen by 13 percentage points since 1990â&#128;&#148;&#13;
from 45 percent to 58 percent of the total population. Improved sanitation coverage rose by 11 percentage points to&#13;
reach 36 percent in 2008.h Across the countries, achieving national goals would require access to be extended to 42&#13;
million people per year for improved water supply, and to 61 million per year for improved sanitation, four and eight&#13;
times, respectively, the current trends.&#13;
&#13;
Rates of progress and absolute levels of coverage vary widely across countries and subsectors. The most recent estimates&#13;
of access to safe water differed by more than 60 percentage points between the top and worst performing countries,&#13;
and the range is even larger for access to improved sanitation facilities. Changes in coverage levels since 1990, both&#13;
positive and negative, span over 50 percentage points in some countriesâ&#128;&#153; subsectors. Across the region, water supply&#13;
coverage is consistently higher than access to sanitation, and urban areas tend to have higher coverage levels than rural&#13;
areas across subsectors. Access to improved water and sanitation is also highly inequitable between rich and poor. In&#13;
almost every subsector, in every country for which data is available, access is regressive, decreasing from the richest fifth&#13;
to the poorest fifth of the population.&#13;
&#13;
Stable, Low-Income Countries have Taken the Lead in Improving Coverage&#13;
and Reforming the Sector&#13;
&#13;
Progress in coverage between 1990 and 2008 does not consistently follow either absolute levels of economic development&#13;
(that is, GDP) or patterns of economic growth. Progress instead relates to the broader political and economic context:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	&#13;
h&#13;
    Where available, these aggregate figures use national estimates of coverage in place of data from the UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                   11&#13;
&amp;#12;AMCOW Country Status Overviewsâ&#128;&#148;Regional Synthesis Report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
low-income, but politically stable, countries committed to sector reform have made greater increases in coverage&#13;
in rural water supply and urban sanitation, reduced open defecation more markedly in rural sanitation, and been&#13;
more successful in keeping water supply coverage up with population growth in urban areas, than either wealthier&#13;
resource-rich countries, or their conflict affected low-income peers. This group of stable, low-income countries also have&#13;
more equitable access, with a smaller gap in coverage between the richest and poorest segments of the population.&#13;
The relatively strong performance of these countries has been helped by large aid flowsâ&#128;&#148;more than three times&#13;
the WSS aid than to fragile low-income countries (per capita unserved), and more than two times that flowing to&#13;
resource-rich countries.&#13;
&#13;
Attracting the largest share of aid, these stable countries have also capitalized on the harmonized and aligned aid&#13;
modalities, deployed by development partners, to successfully transition to more programmatic, â&#128;&#152;country-ledâ&#128;&#153; forms of&#13;
service delivery. These countries have taken responsibility for putting in place the necessary frameworks and capacities&#13;
to coordinate nationwide service delivery. This transition to a â&#128;&#152;country-ledâ&#128;&#153; programmatic approach to service delivery is&#13;
becoming more important as the sector environment continues to shift from a donor-led project-based approach to one&#13;
defined by debt-relief, budget support, and nationally owned and financed sector strategies.&#13;
&#13;
While senior managers in the sector in a given country cannot influence the level of political stability, it is their&#13;
responsibility to seize opportunities within their sphere of influence and continuously develop capacity to coordinate the&#13;
efficient delivery of outcomes at a national scale. Improvements in delivery capacity bolster the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s credibility as an&#13;
investment opportunity for national ministries of finance and external donors. The goal is a virtuous cycle of increasing&#13;
capacity and sector finance.&#13;
&#13;
Managing the transition from a project to a country-led programmatic approach requires a clear identification of present&#13;
barriers to progress at the sector and subsector levels.&#13;
&#13;
The Challenge: Identifying the Barriers in Service Delivery Pathways&#13;
&#13;
     The shift from donor-driven projects to country-led programmatic approaches requires a new&#13;
     management tool (the CSO2 scorecard) that considers the service delivery pathway in its entirety.&#13;
&#13;
     The CSO2 scorecard is a means to facilitate management of subsector programs, by identifying factors&#13;
     that may be stopping inputs (finance) from turning into outcomes (coverage) at the scale and pace&#13;
     required.&#13;
&#13;
     Scorecard results indicate that it is again low-income stable countries that have had most success&#13;
     putting country-led service delivery pathways in place, and are now poised to accelerate further&#13;
     ahead.&#13;
&#13;
Senior managers in the sector are faced with critical information gaps as they transition to country-led service delivery.&#13;
They may have information on inputs (that is, the amount of resources available to them), and outcomes (that is,&#13;
coverage). Just as important, but generally not analyzed systematically, is what happens in-between: what may be&#13;
stopping those inputs from turning into outcomes at the scale and pace required. The CSO2 contributes towards filling&#13;
that information gap. It assesses the service delivery pathwayâ&#128;&#148;the functions that translate inputs to outcomesâ&#128;&#148;using&#13;
a specially developed monitoring tool: the CSO2 scorecard. This tool uses existing country information systems to&#13;
construct an overview of the entire service delivery pathway.&#13;
&#13;
The CSO2 scorecard allows senior managers in the sector and their development partners to see which functions&#13;
of service delivery in each subsector are missing or inadequate: from the policies, plans, and budgets that provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
an enabling framework (the enabling pillar), to the mechanisms for developing new services equitably and at scale&#13;
(the developing pillar), to the systems that sustain services once in place, and allow them to expand â&#128;&#152;organicallyâ&#128;&#153; (the&#13;
sustaining pillar).&#13;
&#13;
At the regional level there is an overall downward trend in scores moving through the service delivery pathway with&#13;
a corresponding decrease in proposed country priority actions to address those weaknesses. While many countries&#13;
have put in place policies and plans, far more emphasis needs to be put on implementation capacity: translating these&#13;
elements of the enabling environment into actual, equitable, and sustainable outcomes on the ground. The apparent&#13;
shortage of potential solutions to strengthen processes for developing and sustaining services points to the need to&#13;
identify front-runners and to foster regional learning to create greater awareness and uptake of available solutions.&#13;
&#13;
Identifying Front-Runners&#13;
&#13;
The same group of low-income, nonfragile countries that have had the most success in increasing access have also&#13;
made most progress in transitioning to country-led programmatic approaches to service deliveryâ&#128;&#148;in line with the Paris&#13;
Principles for aid effectiveness. These front-runners have done so by:&#13;
&#13;
a)	 Developing capacity within sector institutions.&#13;
b)	 Drawing on service delivery capacity in the broader economy.&#13;
c)	 Linking to reforming core government systems: including budget and expenditure management processes and&#13;
    human resources throughout tiers of government.&#13;
&#13;
According to the CSO2 scorecard, these countries now feature the strongest service delivery pathways, and are&#13;
showing promising results in output and intermediate outcomesâ&#128;&#148;increases in number of water points built, improved&#13;
financial viability and efficiency of utilities, as well as increased numbers of extension workers promoting hygiene and&#13;
sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
There is potential for other countries to follow suit. The diagnosis offered by the CSO2 scorecard guides prioritization of&#13;
reform effort. The recommendations in this synthesis report complement the priority actions identified by each country&#13;
in the status overviews. Together these provide senior managers in the sector and their development partners with&#13;
proposals for transitioning to country-led programmatic approaches to service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
Prioritizing Action: Targeting and Sequencing of Reform Effort&#13;
&#13;
   To facilitate the transition towards country-led programmatic approaches, each country involved in&#13;
   the CSO2 process established a list of priority actions.&#13;
&#13;
   Three stages of subsector evolution have been identified. These stages set out a common sequence of&#13;
   reform steps facilitating further prioritization of country actions and tailoring of external support.&#13;
&#13;
   Matching the state of subsector evolution with appropriate aid modalities and technical assistance can&#13;
   accelerate the overall transition to a country-led approach.&#13;
&#13;
To facilitate the transition towards country-led programmatic approaches, a key step in the CSO2 process was for each&#13;
country to establish a list of priority actions based on the country analysis carried out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                              13&#13;
&amp;#12;AMCOW Country Status Overviewsâ&#128;&#148;Regional Synthesis Report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To further aid this transition three stages of subsector development have been identified. Together these stages set out&#13;
a common sequence of reform steps taken by countries as they develop their service delivery pathways in each of the&#13;
four subsectors: rural water supply; urban water supply; rural sanitation; and, urban sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Different WSS subsectors in any particular country often fall into different stages of development. Thus while Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
urban water subsector falls into the most advanced â&#128;&#152;transitionedâ&#128;&#153; group, its other subsectors remain in the â&#128;&#152;transitioningâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
group.&#13;
&#13;
Establishing stage: Subsectors at this stage of development are establishingâ&#128;&#148;or re-establishing after a period of&#13;
crisisâ&#128;&#148;basic elements of the service delivery pathway. The common feature of these subsectors is that they scored&#13;
poorly across all three pillars (enabling, developing, and sustaining).&#13;
&#13;
For water supply most of these â&#128;&#152;establishingâ&#128;&#153; subsectors are in fragile states but for sanitation a number are in stable&#13;
countries, where sanitation is yet to gain a distinct identity or momentum as a subsector. While some subsectors in this&#13;
group may have adopted targets in their national development plans, and have water supply policies, most need to&#13;
develop sanitation policies and better define institutional responsibilities. In fact, nearly half of these subsectors have&#13;
even started forming into a SWAp or initiated subsector investment planning. Annual reviews, if introduced at all, lack&#13;
undertakings. These subsectors are struggling to find even 50 percent of the required funding to meet targets. Most&#13;
external funding is off-budget, being implemented directly by development partners.&#13;
&#13;
For these countries, capacity within subsector institutions is the principal barrier to progress, over and above the capacity&#13;
constraints of core government systems and economywide capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Transitioning stage: These subsectors have basic elements of the service delivery pathway in place but are in the&#13;
process of transitioning to a country-led programmatic approach. Notably this group of subsectors scored well on their&#13;
enabling pillar or their developing pillar, or both. Scores for sustainability were mixed with some, mainly water supply&#13;
subsectors, achieving high scores.&#13;
&#13;
The weaknesses of subsectors at this stage of development point more to difficulties of linking the subsector institutions&#13;
to core government capacities than to weaknesses in the subsector institutions alone. Most subsectors at the transitioning&#13;
stage are in the process of forming into a SWAp, have initiated subsector investment planning, hold annual reviews, and&#13;
have secured more than 50 percent of the required funding to meet targets. Yet a quarter of subsector spending is still&#13;
off-budget. Around half of the subsectors are struggling to spend 75 percent of allocations, in cases where they can be&#13;
tracked. Indeed, lack of definition in the structure of public budgets obscures identification and tracking of expenditure&#13;
in half of the casesâ&#128;&#148;mostly in rural sanitation subsectors. No sanitation subsectors are identified as having sufficient&#13;
finance at local government level to meet their stated subsidy policy and targets. Output reporting is consolidated in&#13;
only half of the subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
The weakest aspect of service delivery pathways across this group is equity. In over half of the cases there are no criteria&#13;
for matching available funding to WSS needs across regions or districts of countries. Even where these are set out the&#13;
criteria are either not adhered to or not monitored. Likewise, procedures to ensure local participation in planning and&#13;
implementation often exist (especially for rural) but are not adhered to systematically.&#13;
&#13;
Transitioned stage: Subsectors at this third stage of development are functioning well and have most of the elements&#13;
of country-led service delivery pathways in place. This group of subsectors score well on both enabling and developing&#13;
pillars demonstrating that both sector capacity and linkages with core government systems are in place. Most donor&#13;
funding is on-budget; domestic and donor expenditure reporting indicates generally high levels of utilization; funding is&#13;
channeled to local spending units; and output reporting is consolidated. For these subsectors, the remaining shortcomings&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
are likely to be located in the sustaining pillar of the service delivery pathway, where refining linkages with economywide&#13;
capacity can be important, including: reinforcing autonomy, commercial orientation and regulation of utility and small&#13;
scheme management (whether public, private or community operated), or entrepreneurs for pit-emptying services and&#13;
installation of sanitation hardware. Even though subsectors in this grouping have transitioned to country-led processes,&#13;
it should be noted that all still need to reach significant unserved populations and, in many cases, are having to do this&#13;
in the face of rapid population growth.&#13;

Priorities for Stages of Subsector Development and Supportive Aid Instruments&#13;
&#13;
The reform process itself needs to be country-led, if sufficient capacity and oversight is to be developed within line&#13;
ministries, agencies and decentralized bodies, to develop and sustain these basic services nationwide. Senior managers&#13;
in the subsectors need to define reform objectives, identify priority actions, and seek out appropriate aid modalities and&#13;
technical assistance to support the step-by-step transition to country-led programmatic approaches.&#13;

&#13;
Development partners have a wide range of modalities and instruments for development assistance that can either&#13;
support or undermine the transition to country-led programmatic approaches. The table on previous page sets out&#13;
desirable characteristics of aid instruments against common reform objectives for each of the three stages of subsector&#13;
development. This aims to promote a division of labor among external support agencies by encouraging development&#13;
partners to match their preferred aid modalities and technical assistance competencies with the relevant stage of&#13;
subsector development. These generalized proposals to senior managers in the subsector and development partners is&#13;
complemented with specific detailed country priorities set out in the 32 country status overview papers.&#13;
&#13;
Resolving the Finance Gap&#13;
&#13;
   A minimum annual shortfall of US$6 billion is projected for capital investments, between requirements&#13;
   of over US$15.5 billion per year and anticipated finance from governments, donors, nongovernmental&#13;
   organizations (NGOs), and households of around US$9.5 billion per year, across the region.&#13;
&#13;
   Poor targeting, uncertainty over the leveraging of user contributions for both capital and operational&#13;
   costs, additional water resource development, and other weaknesses in service delivery pathways&#13;
   mean the true extent of the financing gap may be much higher.&#13;
&#13;
   With aid unlikely to increase three-fold again to meet the gap, countries will need to engage their&#13;
   ministries of finance. Focusing on domestic public spending, analysis of countriesâ&#128;&#153; own resources and&#13;
   their investment requirements, suggests a share of 5 percent of domestic revenues is an appropriate&#13;
   benchmark and advocacy target for the sector.&#13;
&#13;
   Countries that are directing 5 percent of domestic revenue to the sector but still face financing gaps&#13;
   can make a clear case to donors that they require aid increases.&#13;
&#13;
The CSO2 estimates that capital investment requirements will total over US$15 billion annually if all subsector targets&#13;
of the 32 countries are to be achieved. This is based on countriesâ&#128;&#153; own estimates of financing requirements for national&#13;
targets or, where unavailable, the CSO2 costings.&#13;
&#13;
Anticipated capital finance from domestic budgets, donors, and NGOs is estimated at US$5.9 billion per year, which&#13;
is expected to leverage a further US$3.6 billion per year in household contributions. At the aggregate level, a finance&#13;
gap of at least US$6 billion per year needs to be closed to meet the targetsâ&#128;&#148;though poor targeting between countries&#13;
and subsectors, and weak service delivery pathways, mean the additional requirement may be much higher. Assuming&#13;
targeting between countries and subsectors is not substantially improved, the finance gap would increase to at least&#13;
US$7.2 billion per year. The table on the next page sets out the scale of the finance gap by subsector.&#13;
&#13;
These aggregate investment figures conceal significant differences at the country and subsector level. Furthermore, the&#13;
ability of countries to afford investments themselves, whether measured in terms of GDP or government revenue, also&#13;
varies considerably.&#13;
&#13;
The benchmark of 2 percent of GDP (1 percent in public spending and 1 percent from cost recovery and contributions&#13;
from households) for the sector, proposed by the Human Development Report 2006, would be insufficient for low-&#13;
income countries participating in the CSO2â&#128;&#148;by a factor of three in the case of fragile low-income countries. Low-&#13;
income countries as a whole already anticipate spending of close to 2 percent of GDP, but would face a gap even if their&#13;
anticipated finance were optimally allocated between subsectors and countries.&#13;

&#13;
With aid unlikely to more than triple again to fill the finance gap, line ministries across all countries will increasingly&#13;
need to draw down funding from domestic budgets that have benefited from economic growth, debt relief, and budget&#13;
support. The CSO2 analysis suggests that, given constraints on aid and wide variations both in domestic resources and&#13;
required investments, 5 percent of government revenue is a suitable benchmark for the 32 participating countries to aim&#13;
for in their engagement with ministries of finance. Countries that are already approaching this level of spending on the&#13;
domestic side but find it insufficient, can argue that they are especially deserving of aid increases.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Attracting this level of support to the sector will require considerable advocacy, resting on close analysis of financial&#13;
requirements, set against demonstrated effectiveness in turning that finance into coverage. The CSO2 reports provide&#13;
a platform for this in each country, with assessment of the financing gaps to meet sector targets, as well as a detailed&#13;
snapshot of service delivery pathways, based on the scorecard.&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
The target year for the achievement of the MDGs (2015) draws ever closer. The opportunity to accelerate progress lies&#13;
in completing the transition to country-led service delivery that:&#13;
&#13;
a)	 Draws on all available capacity to implement and sustain services (public, private, civil society, and users).&#13;
b)	 Harmonizes and aligns aid flows with domestic and user finance, routed through country systems and institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This transition to country-led service delivery is necessary, desirable, and inevitable: necessary, to cope with the transition&#13;
from project aid to programmatic aid; desirable, as opportunities to increase funding and deliver at scale lie principally&#13;
with developing country governments; and inevitable, as countries transition away from being donor dependent.&#13;
&#13;
The prospects and incentives to make this shift to country-led service delivery are unprecedented. Improving political&#13;
stability, economic growth, debt relief, increasing aid volumes, and the renaissance of country-led service delivery across&#13;
sectors in Africa that has accompanied these developments, mean that the opportunities for sector actors to make an&#13;
impact are more favorable now than they have been in recent times.&#13;
&#13;
Accelerating progress in providing sustainable, equitable access requires:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Strengthening country-led service delivery pathwaysâ&#128;&#148;the mechanisms that translate inputs (incomes: taxes,&#13;
   tariffs, and transfers) into outcomes (sustainable access to water supply and sanitation)â&#128;&#148;across all countries and&#13;
   subsectors.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Increasing current funding levels by at least US$6 billion a year by raising both domestic and donor financing flows&#13;
   to the sector.&#13;
&#13;
The manner in which this will be achieved differs between groups of countries, but the objective remains the same: to&#13;
establish a virtuous cycle in which iterative strengthening of service delivery pathways accelerates outcomes, attracting&#13;
increased funding. Though much of the practical advice in this report is targeted at senior managers within the sector,&#13;
success depends on the realization of a common vision involving the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s line ministries, ministries of finance,&#13;
development partners (official and nongovernmental) and regional bodies such as AMCOW. All parties can contribute,&#13;
for instance:&#13;
&#13;
Line ministries can:&#13;
&#13;
1.	 Work to put in place and strengthen country-led nationwide service delivery. Using the CSO2 scorecard,&#13;
    along with generalized proposals associated with the three stages of subsector development, countries can prioritize&#13;
    reforms for transitioning to country-led programs of service delivery.&#13;
2.	 Undertake evidence-based advocacy to bridge finance gaps while demonstrating improvements in service&#13;
    delivery pathways. The subsector investment gaps calculated in each countryâ&#128;&#153;s individual CSO2 report provide a&#13;
    basis for advocating for increased finance. Due to the limits on further increases in aid, countries will need to&#13;
    approach their ministries of finance as a priority. The regional perspective provided by this synthesis report indicates&#13;
    that 5 percent of domestic revenue from all countries, with existing levels of aid targeted to fill the gaps and user&#13;
    contributions as per policy, would suffice at the regional level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                              19&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Development partners can:&#13;
&#13;
1.	 Support countries to develop their service delivery pathways. Development partners can tailor technical&#13;
    assistance and aid modalities to each subsectorâ&#128;&#153;s stage of development (establishing, transitioning, transitioned) and&#13;
    by doing so progressively increase absorptive capacity and effectiveness of countriesâ&#128;&#153; spend in the sector.&#13;
2.	 Respond to need and reward effort, increasing or reallocating funds for those countries and subsectors which&#13;
    are making convincing efforts to build robust service delivery pathways. Where countries are already allocating 5&#13;
    percent of domestic revenue to WSS and still face financing gaps, there is an especially strong case for scaling up&#13;
    external investment to meet the remaining finance gaps. While countries should demonstrate that they will use&#13;
    funds effectively, equitably, and efficiently, donors may have to take some risks: iteratively investing in services while&#13;
    helping to enhance service delivery pathways.&#13;
&#13;
Ministries of finance can:&#13;
&#13;
1.	 Help meet the financing gap for providing basic services for the population, by incrementally increasing the&#13;
    sectorâ&#128;&#153;s share of the domestic budget to 5 percent of domestic revenue (the regional benchmark proposed in this&#13;
    synthesis report).&#13;
2.	 Support line ministries to embed service delivery pathways, by collaborating to interlink sector processes with&#13;
    core government systems including budget and expenditure management processes and the intergovernmental&#13;
    transfer system.&#13;
&#13;
AMCOW can:&#13;
&#13;
1.	 Advocate for enhanced external support for water supply and sanitation. In line with the Africa Water Vision and&#13;
    as the main regional grouping for senior managers in the sector, AMCOW is well placed to advocate en bloc for&#13;
    increased and better targeted aid for the sector, in fora such as Sanitation and Water for All (SWA).&#13;
2.	 Foster regional learning among peers by sharing good practices, and help to identify and test new solutions. Lessons&#13;
    identified in this synthesis report and the individual country reports provide a starting point for shared learning.&#13;
    Comparison of countriesâ&#128;&#153; self-identified priority actions, with weaknesses in their service delivery pathways, has also&#13;
    highlighted a need for new and robust models, particularly for developing and sustaining services.&#13;

to improved sanitation, this would require past rates of                 achieving national and international sector targets.&#13;

opportunities to engage constructively in reconciling the                countries have shown stronger growth in coverage&#13;

These aggregate figures mask large disparities between                   factors. Viewed through this lens valuable insights both&#13;
countries, subsectors, and rich and poor. For anyone                     into current differences and strategies to address those&#13;

have done better than others, that sanitation lags behind&#13;
water supply, that rural lags behind urban coverage, and                 The four-way country typology used to explore the&#13;
that the rich have a greater share of access. What the                   underlying drivers of progress is borrowed from the Africa&#13;
CSO2 analysis highlights, however, is that the countries                 Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD), which itself&#13;
that have done better are not necessarily the wealthiest                 draws on categories used by the International Monetary&#13;
ones. Rather, it is a group of poorer, but relatively stable             Fund (IMF) in its regular macroeconomic reporting (Table&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Box 3.1&#13;
  Understanding and utilizing the differences between JMP and government data&#13;
&#13;
  The CSO2 utilizes both JMP and government coverage statistics to facilitate discussion around the collection and&#13;
  interpretation of critical sector dataâ&#128;&#148;rather than to claim that either is preferable (Table 3.1). For the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s senior&#13;
  managers, an important step is to understand the underlying reasons for the differences in statistics, so that they can be&#13;
  explained, and used to maximum effect with different audiences.&#13;
&#13;
  For example, ministries of finance and donors may be more accustomed to using household survey data (on which&#13;
  JMP estimates are based) to determine investment priorities between different sectors. Donors may also prefer the&#13;
  international comparability of JMP data. Water supply and sanitation line ministries and their staff, meanwhile, may be&#13;
  more accustomed to using â&#128;&#152;provider dataâ&#128;&#153; from within the sector: for example, the number of water points installed&#13;
  multiplied by an agreed number of users.10 Understanding why the data differâ&#128;&#148;for instance, because there is a time lag&#13;
  between output (provider data) and outcome (user data)â&#128;&#148;will enable senior managers to identify sector priorities more&#13;
  accurately and make more convincing cases for additional resources from ministries of finance and donors.&#13;
&#13;
  Other underlying factors which may be at work include differing views on what technologies constitute improved access,&#13;
  and the JMPâ&#128;&#153;s use of several household surveys to guard against outliers, whereas government may prefer to use the&#13;
  results of only the last survey.&#13;

Water supply coverage in both urban and rural areas is                                   at the coverage change, the huge differences between&#13;

    Aid and Domestic Finance&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   Development assistance has played an important role in advancing coverage.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   The good progress of low-income stable countries was assisted by their receiving three times more aid&#13;
          than low-income fragile countries and two times more aid than resource-rich countries, per unserved&#13;
          person.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   Past levels of aid to sanitation, and past domestic spending on the subsector in general, are difficult to&#13;
          discern.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   However, aid and other forms of external finance are spreading to other countries, and domestic funds,&#13;
          allocated by ministries of finance, are set to play an increasingly important role, especially for resource-&#13;
          rich countries and low-income stable countries.&#13;

The relatively strong performance of stable countries&#13;
described in the previous chapter has been supported&#13;
by large aid flows (Figure 4.1). Stable countries received      Though urban water supply received over three times as&#13;
three times the WSS aid that flowed to the fragile country      much aid per unserved person as rural water supply, the&#13;
grouping per capita unserved and two times that flowing         coverage disparity between rural and urban has declined&#13;

and just over US$40 per rural beneficiary added to the          connections to overall access: 2:5 versus 1:4 in low-income&#13;

and other important factors for interpreting the data are                                                        integrated with water supplyâ&#128;&#148;particularly in the 1990s.&#13;

                                                                                                                 delivery is becoming more country-led, the spending can&#13;

difficult to trace as the funding was relatively minor and                                                       as expenditure on health workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Box 4.1&#13;
  Interpreting sector progress against aid per capita&#13;
&#13;
  In comparing aid per beneficiary against subsector progress (Figure 4.2) it is important to understand the influence of&#13;
  other factors, including:&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 The proportion of domestic fundingâ&#128;&#148;including budget supportâ&#128;&#148;that is flowing into the sector.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Country policy on technology choice.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 The efficacy of targeting and sustaining interventions to the unserved.&#13;
&#13;
  Unraveling the contribution of these three factors is extremely complex but the following insights are a start.&#13;
&#13;
  Countries that are channeling domestic funding to the sector would be expected to have proportionately lower aid per&#13;
  beneficiary. However, the magnitude of that reduction is related to the ratio of domestic to external financing: it is only&#13;
  in countries with consistent and very high domestic to external ratios of funding that aid per beneficiary is an order of&#13;
  magnitude lower. For example, external financing of urban water supply in South Africa has for the majority of the&#13;
  period 1995â&#128;&#147;2005 been less than 10 percent of the total flows to the sector. Thus, even though unit costs and service&#13;
  levels are high in South Africa, aid per beneficiary is under US$10. However, other than South Africa there are few&#13;
  countries in SSA that have been consistently providing even 50 percent of the overall funding to the WSS subsectors.&#13;
  Some resource-rich countries (Angola, Congo Brazzaville, Sudan) have been more consistent in funding urban water&#13;
  supply than other WSS subsectorsâ&#128;&#148;significantly reducing levels of aid to urban beneficiaries.&#13;

     In rural water supply too technology choice has influenced aid per beneficiary. Mauritania, Senegal, CÃ´te&#13;
     dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, The Gambia, and South Africa have invested heavily in rural piped water schemes which have yielded&#13;
     significant rises in rural household connections. In a second tier of countriesâ&#128;&#148;Angola, Benin, Ghana, Kenya,&#13;
     Mali, and Rwandaâ&#128;&#148;piped water supplies have formed a significant part of the overall technology mix used&#13;
     to expand access in rural areas. The lower aid per beneficiary in Kenya is due to domestic financing and&#13;
     significant user financing of CAPEX.&#13;
&#13;
     By contrast, countries that have had a policy of low cost solutions such as Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Uganda, and&#13;
     Malawi have considerably lower aid per beneficiary costs. The low aid per beneficiary in Nigeria is due both to&#13;
     the application of low cost solutions and domestic financing.&#13;
&#13;
     The remaining factorâ&#128;&#148;the efficacy of targeting and sustaining access to the unservedâ&#128;&#148;plays an important role&#13;
     as upgrading the service level of people already accessing improved water supplies does not increase overall&#13;
     coverage. Much of the remaining variation in aid per beneficiary is attributable to systems for delivering and&#13;
     sustaining systemsâ&#128;&#148;the subject of the next chapter on service delivery pathways.&#13;

    Service Delivery Pathways&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   The shift from donor-driven projects to country-led programmatic approaches requires a new management&#13;
       tool (the CSO2 scorecard) that considers the service delivery pathway in its entirety.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   The CSO2 scorecard is a means to facilitate management of subsector programs, by identifying factors that&#13;
       may be stopping inputs (finance) from turning into outcomes (coverage) at the scale and pace required.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Scorecard results indicate that it is again low-income stable countries that have had most success putting&#13;
       country-led service delivery pathways in place, and are now poised to accelerate further ahead. Detailed&#13;
       case studies show how this has been achieved through clear objectives and cooperation with development&#13;
       partners.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Experiences from these countries indicate the importance of ensuring service delivery pathways are&#13;
       embedded within, and linked to, core government systems (for example, for planning and budgeting) and&#13;
       the wider economy (from private utility operators to small scale artisans providing sanitation options).&#13;

The CSO2 scorecard facilitates assessment of the intervening service delivery pathway, which translates sector&#13;
funding (inputs) into service coverage (outcomes). A strong service delivery pathway, as indicated by scorecard&#13;
results, builds the case that finance will translate into outcomes efficiently, sustainably, and equitably, so attracting&#13;
further funding.&#13;

Essential features of the CSO2 scorecard&#13;
&#13;
Each building block describes a discrete function within the service delivery pathway: three relate to enabling services&#13;
(policy, planning, and budgets), three relate to developing services (expenditure, equity, and output), and the final three&#13;
relate to sustaining services (for water supply: maintenance, expansion, and use; for sanitation: markets, uptake, and&#13;
use). The nine building blocks, and the three â&#128;&#152;pillarsâ&#128;&#153; of enabling, developing, and sustaining services, are placed in a&#13;
certain order. The ordering presents a hypothesis of the most important cause and effect relationships in delivering&#13;
services in the various subsectors (Figure 5.2), but is open to interpretation and debate.&#13;

Scoring is undertaken as follows. Each building block is assessed against three indicators: these indicators are scored 1,&#13;
0.5 or 0, on the basis of clearly defined response options. For example, an indicator for the â&#128;&#152;Planningâ&#128;&#153; building block is&#13;
the presence of an annual sector review involving all partners. No review at all receives a score of 0; an annual review&#13;
receives a score of 0.5; the review has to set undertakings each year (so linking it to the planning system) for a full score&#13;
of 1. The full list of indicators and response options for each subsector is presented in Appendix A.&#13;
&#13;
Adding up the three indicator subscores derives the overall score for the building block, from 0 to 3. A simple color&#13;
code is then assigned, so that barriers to service delivery can be quickly identified. Scores of two or more indicate that&#13;
the building block is largely in place and is a driver of service delivery (green color). Scores between 1 and 2 indicate the&#13;
building block is a drag on service delivery and requires attention (yellow). Scores of less than 1 indicate the building&#13;
block is a barrier to service delivery and must be prioritized for reform (red). The indicators assessed differ for each&#13;
subsectorâ&#128;&#148;rural water supply, urban water supply, rural sanitation, and urban sanitation.&#13;

The reminder of this chapter extracts the most pertinent                clear leadership and targets; mechanisms to coordinate&#13;
results from scorecard assessments across the region,                   plan and review investments; and clear, comprehensive&#13;

groupings introduced in Chapter 3 are used to explore                   blocks are policy, planning, and budget. Across the&#13;
which countries have made the most progress, and                        region, progress and challenges are outlined in Table 5.1&#13;
potential lessons they provide for others.                              with reference to selected scorecard indicators (referred&#13;

     Good practice: Laying the foundation for enabling urban water supply in Burkina Faso&#13;
&#13;
     Though Burkina Fasoâ&#128;&#153;s scores in this subsector are strong throughout the enabling pillar, the most fundamental reform&#13;
     has been a clear definition of roles between the ministry and the public utility, ONEA.&#13;
&#13;
     The lead line Ministry (MAHRH, the Ministry for Agriculture, Water and Fisheries) has taken an overall coordination&#13;
     role, but given ONEA autonomy, while safeguarding accountability through three-year performance contracts (contrats&#13;
     plans). Restructuring and strengthening of ONEA has been ongoing since the 1990s, with the result that the utility has&#13;
     radically improved its management structures, developing a Corporate Strategic Plan and becoming the first public WSS&#13;
     utility in the region to be ISO-9001 certified.21&#13;
&#13;
     In the last decade a private operator has been contracted to improve commercial aspects of ONEAâ&#128;&#153;s operations (including&#13;
     billing and collection) and to set up customer management and accounting systems. Again, roles and accountability&#13;
     have been clearly defined, with the private operator contracted on a performance basis, and reimbursed for specified&#13;
     achievements.22&#13;
&#13;
     Having delegated the tasks of service delivery to the utility and private operator, MAHRH has been able to focus on&#13;
     further strengthening the enabling environment, reflected in Burkina Fasoâ&#128;&#153;s other indicator scores for this pillar: In 1998,&#13;
     a national policy for water was launched; in 2006, a needs assessed sector investment plan was introduced (the PN-&#13;
     AEPA) based around nationally recognized targets. The PN-AEPA has been critical in the subsectorâ&#128;&#153;s transition to a full&#13;
     programmatic approach, with donors aligning around the plan and dialogue and coordination strengthened through an&#13;
     annual review process between government and its development partners. Budgets now capture the majority of sector&#13;
     allocations, domestic and donor alike.&#13;
&#13;
     Substantial external investments have also played their part in the subsectorâ&#128;&#153;s strong progress in coverage, which reached&#13;
     95 percent in 2008 according to the JMP (ONEAâ&#128;&#153;s own estimates are more cautious). As the CSO2 report for Burkina&#13;
     Faso notes, finance has been forthcoming for a subsector that represents such a stable, sound investment proposition.&#13;
     Moreover ONEA now finances 20â&#128;&#147;30 percent of its capital investments from its own revenues.&#13;
&#13;
     Several of these reforms are reflected in other subsectors, which also receive high scores for the enabling pillar. The&#13;
     sanitation subsectors are emulating the key success factor for urban water supply, of institutional clarity. A new sanitation&#13;
     policy and strategy was adopted in 2007, and a separate department (DGAEUE) designated as sector lead in 2008.&#13;
     Urban sanitation also falls under ONEAâ&#128;&#153;s responsibility. The subsector has received a significant boost with the innovation&#13;
     of Strategic Sanitation Plans (PSAs), which are now being rolled out in secondary towns, having been spearheaded in the&#13;
     major urban centers of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.&#13;

     Good practice: Decentralized and equitable development of rural water supplies in Uganda&#13;
&#13;
     Since the late 1990s efforts to improve water supply and sanitation in Uganda have taken place in the context of broad&#13;
     economic reforms and debt relief. The prominence of water and sanitation was raised with the establishment of the&#13;
     Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) and Poverty Action Fund (PAF)â&#128;&#148;Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s poverty reduction strategy. Related&#13;
     water sector reforms included a shift in the role of government from service provider to policy maker, a shift from&#13;
     projects to a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) to planning and the development of Strategic Investment Plans (SIPs).&#13;
&#13;
     On top of these broad enabling reforms Uganda has evolved its developing pillar with effective mechanisms for&#13;
     decentralized service delivery, particularly of rural water supplies and sanitation. Most donor funding for rural water&#13;
     supply and sanitation investments is channeled to the Government of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s consolidated fund and then remitted&#13;
     along with additional domestic finance to over 100 local governments as the District Water and Sanitation Development&#13;
     Conditional Grant. The Grant, clearly identified in government budgets, has succeeded in priming local government&#13;
     capacityâ&#128;&#148;which though initially weakâ&#128;&#148;now has sufficient numbers of qualified staff to manage a large program of&#13;
     service delivery using private sector contractors. Collectively local government output of around 3,000 water points per&#13;
     year has been sustained since 2002.&#13;
&#13;
     Joint sector reviews have played an important role in monitoring the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity of distribution&#13;
     of these water points pointing out unequal implementation performance across districts and rising unit costs. While&#13;
     the Grant was allocated according to the SIP, the Ministry of Water and the Environment has, since 2008, set specific&#13;
     criteria to address the inequitable distribution of rural water services between districts which allocate more funds to&#13;
     underserved parts of the country. Criteria are based on coverage, population (current and projected to 2012), and&#13;
     average cost (technology mix). The allocation system was commended by the Local Government Finance Commission as&#13;
     the most equitable of all Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s sectors.23 Ongoing work to map water supplies across the entire country will provide&#13;
     a new, Global Positioning System referenced inventory to enable a more accurate assessment of access, water quality,&#13;
     functionality, and replacement requirements that will further improve allocation.&#13;

blocks for water supply are maintenance, expansion, and            progress in coverage there is a poor correlation between&#13;
use. For sanitation they are markets, uptake, and use. Key         level of country economic development (GDP per&#13;

     Good practice: Sustaining rural water supply in decentralized Ghana&#13;
&#13;
     Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s sound performance in the sustaining pillar for rural water supply arises from a gradual transition towards a&#13;
     demand-driven, community-managed model, in keeping with the countryâ&#128;&#153;s broader shift towards decentralization. A&#13;
     local government act of 1993 placed considerable responsibilities on district assemblies for planning and supervising&#13;
     the management of rural water supply, but permitted them to delegate this latter task to WATSAN committees or, in&#13;
     the case of small towns, Water and Sanitation Boards. Meanwhile the department in charge of rural water supply was&#13;
     established as the independent Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA) in 1998 and has since transitioned&#13;
     from direct implementation, to providing support and supervision to the district assemblies through its regional teams.&#13;
&#13;
     Levels of cost recovery are sufficient to meet the operational costs of community schemesâ&#128;&#148;a first, and critical, indicator&#13;
     assessed by the CSO2 scorecard. Until 2009, the demand-driven model meant that communities were required to provide&#13;
     5 percent of the capital costs of new schemes, with exceptions granted on the grounds of poverty, disease incidence,&#13;
     or emergencies. This has been an important factor in securing ownership and community willingness to sustain their&#13;
     own systems. The abolition of this rule has raised concerns that ownership will be reduced, with a consequent negative&#13;
     impact on levels of operational cost recovery.&#13;
&#13;
     Ghana also scores well for its strong supply chain for spare parts. The government directly supported the supply chain&#13;
     with subsidies until 2009, based around private sector management and a standardized range of four handpump types.&#13;
     The supply chain is now viewed as self-sustaining, with sales outlets available in all 10 regions, and most districts.&#13;
&#13;
     These factors have helped sustain Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s high levels of access to rural water supply, up 25 percent from 1990â&#128;&#147;2008&#13;
     according to the CWSA, and doubling (from 37 percent to 74 percent) according to the JMP. Of those with improved&#13;
     access, less than a quarter are estimated to spend more than 30 minutes collecting waterâ&#128;&#148;another scorecard indicator&#13;
     on which Ghana performs well, in the sustaining pillar.&#13;
&#13;
     Though Ghana scores well relative to its peers, there is still room for improvement. In particular, there is limited support&#13;
     for rural and small towns to expand their networksâ&#128;&#148;cost recovery from users is often insufficient for expansion.&#13;
&#13;
     Technical support is also an area for improvement: in theory the regional teams of the CWSA provide this, but in practice&#13;
     their capacity is limited. Promising efforts have been under way, with a pilot project to set up Monitoring of Operation&#13;
     and Maintenance Units (MOMS) in some regional CWSA offices, each with two dedicated staff for backstopping.&#13;
     Funding is required to scale this up to the remaining regions.&#13;

warrant specific mention.                                                    stalling of sanitation subsector investment planning is&#13;

First, despite wide acceptance that policy and program                       no need for a public sector budget. This in turn translates&#13;
development in sanitation needs to be led by a single                        into no public funding for staffing and equipping local&#13;
designated government agency (for example, eThekwini                         spending unitsâ&#128;&#148;local government departmentsâ&#128;&#148;to carry&#13;

Second, there remains considerable policy uncertainty                        improve sanitation are all but absent. This monitoring&#13;
about the countriesâ&#128;&#153; position on sanitation subsidies. This                  is needed to understand and improve the relationship&#13;
leads to inconsistent practice in sanitation service delivery                between public interventions and the quality and quantity&#13;
both across development agencies and between agencies                        of household uptake of sanitation. Tanzania provides a&#13;

     Good practice: Impact evaluation of sanitation interventions in Tanzania&#13;
&#13;
     Tanzania has made inroads to understanding which public interventions on sanitation are most effective: hygiene&#13;
     promotion, sanitation marketing, or using both together. The Total Sanitation and Sanitation Marketing project aims&#13;
     to increase sanitation at the community level through CLTS and at the household level through sanitation marketing (a&#13;
     communications campaign convincing household consumers to invest in an improved latrine, with marketing techniques&#13;
     also used on the supply side), with hygiene promotion also integrated via a hand washing campaign. Impact evaluation&#13;
     is being conducted to identify and quantify the most effective intervention in terms of health and poverty improvements.&#13;
     Within the 10 project districts, eligible wards were selected, and randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) Hand&#13;
     washing activities; (2) Sanitation activities; (3) Hand washing and Sanitation activities; and (4) Control (no activities)â&#128;&#148;to&#13;
     test the efficacy of the different interventions.&#13;

country-led programmatic approaches.24&#13;

The project-led approaches were initially highly hardware&#13;
                                                                     sustainability of the spending on WSS?&#13;
oriented and supply-driven but paid increasing attention&#13;
to demand-responsiveness and the importance of                       A series of case studies is presented here to illustrate the&#13;
the â&#128;&#152;softwareâ&#128;&#153; aspects of service delivery, mobilizing               way in which service delivery pathways have been linked&#13;
community capacity for scheme management, hygiene                    to:&#13;
and sanitation behavior change. In the â&#128;&#153;90s this was&#13;
extended to private sector capacity with the liberalization          a)	 Core        government        systems  (planning,&#13;
of drilling and construction markets as well as private                  budgeting, expenditure management processes,&#13;
sector participation (first international and then                       intergovernmental transfers, and decentralized&#13;
domestic) in utility and scheme managementâ&#128;&#148;building                      service delivery) on the one hand; and&#13;
further water sector linkages to economywide capacity                b)	 Economywide capacity (markets, civil society, and&#13;
for service delivery.25                                                  private sector capacity) on the other.&#13;
&#13;
In turn the building of linkages to core government                  These â&#128;&#152;key lessonsâ&#128;&#153; apply to the low income, fragile and&#13;
systems was driven forward by the introduction of the                resource-rich groupings alike (and also to the remaining&#13;
â&#128;&#152;new poverty agendaâ&#128;&#153;: PRSPs and the increased emphasis               low-income stable countries that have not been front-&#13;
on basic service delivery as well as attention to the                runners) underpinning the identification of tailored&#13;
functioning of core government systems.26, 27                        reform priorities for all countries in Chapter 6.&#13;

   Case studyâ&#128;&#148;Benin: Linking to strong core government systems boosts rural water supply output&#13;
&#13;
   In 2001, in support of Beninâ&#128;&#153;s interim PRSP, World Bank sector projects were closed with a view to instead supporting the&#13;
   Government of Benin to transition to a programmatic approach. This governmentwide programmatic approach was to&#13;
   be set out in the full PRSP and a related medium term expenditure framework (MTEF). At the core government systems&#13;
   level a Public Expenditure Reform Adjustment Credit (PERAC) supported public expenditure management reforms&#13;
   including a transition from a line-item based budget to a program-based budget. At sector level analytical and advisory&#13;
   workâ&#128;&#148;including sector PERsâ&#128;&#148;helped sectors to develop programs with supporting program-based budgets, laying the&#13;
   ground for shifting spending authority from the ministry of finance to line ministries, and progressive deconcentration&#13;
   and decentralization of service delivery (World Bank, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
   At HIPC completion point in 2003, the Government of Benin developed a full PRSP in which improving access to&#13;
   safe water was one of the top priorities. A Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series that included rural water&#13;
   supply was aligned with the PRSP and budget cycles. Supported by Beninâ&#128;&#153;s Commissioner of Budget it was argued that&#13;
   Benin needed to address structural public sector management issues in order to unblock constraints on public sector&#13;
   implementation capacity. The limited absorption capacity was leading to low execution rates in donor projects making&#13;
   Benin look â&#128;&#152;overâ&#128;&#153; financed.&#13;

     In its core public expenditure management systems Benin made significant progress under this PRSC series. Program&#13;
     budgets are now produced for 17 sectors and details are integrated into the annual budget submitted to Parliament.&#13;
     SIGFIP, the budget execution software, has been extended to all ministries and even to the department level. The SIGFIP&#13;
     budget system has also been adapted to allow comprehensive coverage of donor-financed expenditure. Ministry staff&#13;
     manage and monitor the programs in the program-based budgets, and report on these in their annual performance&#13;
     reports. Performance-based contracts between the minister of finance and the ministers responsible for designated&#13;
     subprograms are signed. The 2006 and 2007 budgets were prepared in terms of program authorizations and payment&#13;
     appropriations, which is an encouraging step to enable multiyear contractsâ&#128;&#148;important for the water sector. Sector&#13;
     performance reports are produced regularly. Progress was also made in budget execution reporting and transparency,&#13;
     and in reducing fiduciary risk.&#13;
&#13;
     Along with these reforms allowing the sector to tap into core government systems, has come impressive progress in&#13;
     rural water supply. Benin, based on the latest household survey data, is on-track to meet its rural water supply MDG.&#13;
     Between 2001 and 2008 physical sector outputâ&#128;&#148;as measured in the number of water points planned and constructed&#13;
     per yearâ&#128;&#148;has increased more than four-fold. The functionality of water points and schemes has improved from 77 to&#13;
     88 percent.&#13;

     Box 5.7&#13;
     Case Studyâ&#128;&#148;Ethiopia: Vast evolving government health extension system to promote sanitation&#13;
&#13;
     The current era of reform in Ethiopia began in the early 1990s, with the establishment of the present system of&#13;
     government. Prior to that, there was little in the way of policies or programs to address sanitation needs, and therefore&#13;
     the current government inherited a legacy of extremely low sanitation coverage.&#13;
&#13;
     In 2004, the Government of Ethiopia launched a national preventive health extension program which had a strong&#13;
     hygiene and sanitation focus, aiming to achieve 100 percent sanitation coverage by 2012 (recently changed to 2015).&#13;
     This was reinforced in 2006 with the development of a National Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy which articulated a&#13;
     strategic shift towards low cost sanitation solutions coupled with large-scale investment in promotion, which would&#13;
     leverage the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s huge and expanding network of women health extension workers (over 30,000) already&#13;
     employed across the country.&#13;
&#13;
     This cadre of women health extension workers working at village level are supported by the national Health Extension&#13;
     Program, a far-reaching initiative to bring preventive health services to all Ethiopians. The program is staffed by health&#13;
     officers at the local government, regional, and federal levels. It is a core government program funded out of general&#13;
     unearmarked block grants that cascade from the federal level, through regional level to local government (woreda) level,&#13;
     and is managed within Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s national integrated budget and expenditure management system.&#13;
&#13;
     Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s development partners contribute to this via two main routes. First, through the Protection of Basic Services&#13;
     (PBS) program which channels money through government systems, co-mingling funding with the block grant. PBS&#13;

    additional resources for implementation of the national Health Extension Program, and technical assistance adapting&#13;
    and refining the program.&#13;
&#13;
    Although the program still faces challenges in terms of finance and the breadth of the tasks expected from health&#13;
    extension workers, notable progress has been made in improving sanitation and hygiene coverage at grassroots level.&#13;
    According to government figures (which relax the definition of improved facilities) coverage had reached 39 percent&#13;
    in 2009. JMP figures confirm this progress showing that the rate of open defecation had dropped by 28 percent&#13;
    between 1990 and 2008, meaning 19 million Ethiopians in rural areas have gained access to basic, shared or improved&#13;
    sanitation.&#13;

    service delivery&#13;
&#13;
    Between 1998 and 2005 the World Bank funded a US$17 million project rural water and sanitation project. The main&#13;
    objective of the project was to develop national capacity for delivering RWSS to communities across a terrain that is both&#13;
    extremely varied hydro-geologically and that is physically difficult to access due to the very limited roads infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
    Over this period a successful service delivery arrangement emerged that eventually exceeded the targets set at the&#13;
    time of appraisal by 40 percent reaching 400,000 people. This was achieved by a small Department of Water and&#13;
    Sanitation (DEA) with less than 60 professional staff, all but 13 based in the capital, outsourcing the development of&#13;
    rural gravity schemes to three NGOs (Caritas, TARATRA, FIKRIFAMA) and boreholes with handpumps to private sector&#13;
    drilling companies. NGOs also carried out the community management training for handpumps.&#13;
&#13;
    Putting this service delivery arrangement in place took time, particularly the procurement of the drilling companies, the&#13;
    contracts for which were not awarded until 30 months after project effectiveness. However, once in place, economies of&#13;
    scale were achieved by grouping construction activities to be carried out in small rural communities under large multiyear&#13;
    umbrella contracts. Sector delivery capacity tripled over the project period to about 300 new gravity systems and 350&#13;
    boreholes per year (World Bank, 2005).29 This progress has been confirmed by household surveys.&#13;

   Box 6.1&#13;
   The capacity conundrum&#13;
&#13;
   In most fragile countries the capacity of state institutions is initially too weak to meet donor service delivery standards or&#13;
   accountability requirements. Yet in the face of these constraints governments and donors have to act: to reap the peace&#13;
   dividend and ensure any results achieved are sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
   The capacity conundrum is encountered as a sector transitions from emergency interventions provided by NGOs and&#13;
   humanitarian agencies, relying on their own capacity. At the next stage, project grants and loans channeled to the line&#13;
   ministry through special accounts outside the regular government expenditure management system become appropriate.&#13;
   Examples include multisectoral rehabilitation programs and social investment funds or community-driven development&#13;
   programs, supported by coalitions of donors led by multilateral agencies, often the World Bank. At this stage, however,&#13;
   national implementation capacity is the key constraint, most obviously in the public sector, but also in the private sector:&#13;
   from contractors, to suppliers, to the whole array of support services such as transportation and banking.&#13;
&#13;
   In such circumstances, the best way to develop capacity is to use it: working in partnership with countries to make&#13;
   incremental improvements in government implementation capacity even as they channel increasing funds through&#13;
   government systems. Box 5.8 demonstrates how a major rural water supply project in Madagascar developed capacity&#13;
   in the water and sanitation department by entrusting it with coordination, while simultaneously evolving civil society and&#13;
   private sector capacity for drilling and construction.&#13;

Case Studyâ&#128;&#148;Rwanda: From crisis to development of the rural water supply service delivery&#13;
pathway&#13;
&#13;
From 1995 to 2003, Rwanda moved from the ruins of genocide to the implementation of advanced macroeconomic&#13;
management practices, public financial management reforms, and progressive improvements in basic service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
The WSS sector policy issued in 1998 provided a basis to steer the transition from post-crisis donor-executed emergency&#13;
interventions to sector projects guided by a coherent set of policy principles including: demand-based planning,&#13;
community management (through the so-called RÃ©gies Associatives), and local cost recovery. The sector policy was&#13;
regularly updated. First in 2004 to reflect Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s program of decentralization and then, in 2010, to formalize the&#13;
policy of delegated management through local public-private partnership.&#13;
&#13;
The 1998 policy provided the basis for a World Bank funded rural WSS project. The government-executed $20 million&#13;
project ran from 2000 to 2007 and provided a testing ground to translate the policy principles into practice, developing&#13;
the implementation capacity of the rural WSS unit within the WSS directorate.&#13;
&#13;
Responding to Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s unique topography, hydrology, and demography, the project focused on the development&#13;
and rehabilitation of rural piped systems. The operational model that emerged from the project is one in which the&#13;
development of large piped systems is driven by community planning, with a centralized design, procurement, and&#13;
contract management process, supported by district-level supervision and oversight. This is complemented by gap-filling&#13;
with simpler point source technologies implemented entirely by the government, using central government subventions&#13;
such as the Community Development Fund.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank supported project was instrumental in building the capacity of local contractors. Almost nonexistent in&#13;
the RWSS sector at the beginning of the project, local contractors carried out US$10.6 million of construction works.&#13;
The absorption capacity of the sector increased 10-fold, with the number of people getting access to improved water&#13;
services each year jumping from 60,000 to 600,000 people during the project period. The service delivery model, the&#13;
additional public sector technical and private sector construction capacity developed under the project formed the core&#13;
of a countrywide sector program attracting additional funding from AfDB, the EC, Austria, Belgium, and Japan.&#13;
&#13;
Restoring and reforming key components of the public expenditure management systems steadily progressed over the&#13;
period. Budgeting and expenditure management processes were streamlined and systematically implemented across&#13;
all line ministries. The Central Projects and External Financing Bureau were established in the Ministry of Finance in late&#13;
1998 to monitor and coordinate donor funded projects. In 1999 a National Tender Board was established.&#13;
&#13;
By 2002 the confidence derived from the extensive fiduciary assessment and analytical work allowed the World Bank to&#13;
accede to the Government of Rwanda (GoRâ&#128;&#153;s) preference for budget support which was provided through a series of&#13;
Poverty Reduction Support Credits for selected high priority sectors including education, health, water, and energy.&#13;
&#13;
Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s rural WSS subsector is making steady progress supported by a combination of earmarked programmatic&#13;
funding and budget support using harmonized procedures for procurement and financial management based on GoR&#13;
systems. Sector agencies and partners are now taking steps to improve the sustainability for the 800-plus systems in&#13;
place through capacity building and strengthened oversight of the local contracts.&#13;
&#13;
The evolution of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s rural WSS subsector illustrates well the transition from donor-executed projects toward a&#13;
country-led sector program over the 1998-2010 period. This example shows the importance of setting a clear policy&#13;
direction at the sector level combined with a drive to integrate the sector into core public sector management systems.&#13;
&#13;
It is worth noting that, in contrast, the urban water subsector has not yet transitioned to a country-led approach to&#13;
service delivery. Still at the transitioning stage, the subsector is yet to put in place key building blocks in the service&#13;
delivery pathway and is struggling to muster funding commensurate with its large investment requirements related in&#13;
particular to the expansion of its production capacity to meet rapidly growing demand in Kigali.&#13;

The Rwanda case study (Box 6.2) illustrates the way in     by agencies varies, with some agencies specializing in&#13;

7.	 The Finance Gap and How It Can&#13;
    Be Addressed&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   A minimum annual shortfall of US$6 billion is projected for capital investments, between requirements of&#13;
       over US$15.5 billion per year and anticipated finance from governments, donors, NGOs, and households&#13;
       of around US$9.5 billion per year, across the region.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Poor targeting, uncertainty over the leveraging of user contributions for both capital and operational&#13;
       costs, additional water resource development, and other weaknesses in service delivery pathways mean&#13;
       the true extent of the deficit may be much higher.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Benchmark spending of 2 percent of GDP for the sector from public funds and households, proposed by&#13;
       the Human Development Report 2006, will be insufficient for low-income countries participating in the&#13;
       CSO2â&#128;&#148;by a factor of three in the case of fragile states.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   With aid unlikely to increase three-fold again to meet the gap, countries will need to engage their&#13;
       ministries of finance. Focusing on domestic public spending, analysis of countriesâ&#128;&#153; own resources and their&#13;
       investment requirements, suggests a share of 5 percent of domestic revenues is an appropriate benchmark&#13;
       and advocacy target for the sector.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Countries that are directing 5 percent of domestic revenue to the sector but still face financing gaps can&#13;
       make a clear case to donors that they require aid increases.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   At the same time, whether advocating for increased resources from domestic or external sources, senior&#13;
       managers will need to continue to strengthen service delivery pathways, demonstrating that their&#13;
       subsectors represent a sound investment proposition.&#13;

catalyze the discussion with ministries of finance around&#13;
how much they can afford to contribute, and also to help&#13;
donors to identify where there is clearly a case for more&#13;
aid. Countries that cannot meet their requirements even&#13;
after committing 5 percent of domestic revenues are&#13;
arguably particularly deserving of aid increases, whether&#13;
in practice this comes in the form of â&#128;&#152;newâ&#128;&#153; or reallocated&#13;
money.&#13;
&#13;
Whether line ministries are engaging with their ministries&#13;
of finance or donors for additional funds, they will need&#13;
to demonstrate that the money will be spent effectively.&#13;
This requires clear evidence that service delivery pathways&#13;
are in place to convert finance into services.&#13;
&#13;
Analysis such as that undertaken using the CSO2 scorecard&#13;
can help build this case. The sectorâ&#128;&#153;s senior managers&#13;
will also need to be transparent about policy decisions&#13;
which have a significant bearing on the affordability&#13;
of investment requirements for the public purse. As a&#13;
country-led process, the CSO2 costing estimates reflect&#13;
the technology mix and user contribution policies that are&#13;
in place or planned for the medium-term in each country.&#13;
This has the advantage of improving contextual relevance&#13;
by accepting government choices, which generally arise&#13;
from a complex fusion of political preference, perceived&#13;
financial constraints, and hydrological characteristics&#13;
(not every technology is equally suitable everywhere).&#13;
However, these factors also have a substantial impact&#13;
on how much it will cost the public purse to achieve a&#13;
given coverage level, and need to be carefully examined&#13;
within each country: whether a cheaper technology&#13;
mix is feasible; whether user contributions are realistic&#13;
(for example, in countries claiming a 100 percent user&#13;
contribution for sanitation), or could be increased           The economic returns of water supply and sanitation&#13;
without adverse impacts on poor people.                       investment are clear. Cost-benefit studies from the WHO&#13;

            Pathways to progress : transitioning to
            country-led service delivery pathways to meet Africa's
            water supply and sanitation targets
        </repnme>

            The African Ministers Council on Water
            (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of
            Country Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what
            underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what
            its member governments can do to accelerate that progress
            across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Based on the
            extensive in-country diagnostics, analysis, and stakeholder
            consultations, the second CSO provides these insights for 32
            countries in SSA, for which there are separate individual
            country reports. This document is the regional synthesis of
            the 32 country status overviews which collectively account
            for 95 percent of SSA's population and over 90 percent
            of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The report highlights the
            most important trends, challenges, and proposed actions for
            achieving improved water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            services across Sub-Saharan Africa. The opportunities for
            progress are identified based on: understanding trends,
            identifying the challenge, and prioritizing action.
