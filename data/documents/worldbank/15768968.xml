        <abstracts>
            Capacity is the ability of individuals,
            organizations, state institutions, coalitions, and society
            itself to catalyze change to achieve their development
            objectives. Capacity development is therefore a country-led
            and country-owned process of change, requiring collective
            solutions from all segments of society-public, private, and
            civil. The overarching objective is to create capable and
            accountable states, a competitive and responsible private
            sector, and an engaged and empowered citizenry. Collective
            solutions require new forms of collaboration, whether
            through public-private partnerships for the provision of
            infrastructure, health, or education; citizen report cards
            to improve public service delivery; or mayors working
            together for climate change mitigation in urban centers.
            Developing the capacity for collective action means
            developing the capacity of entire leadership teams or
            ministries. It also means building multi stakeholder
            coalitions, sometimes even among conflicting social groups,
            to forge a consensus for change. The vision is to be a
            catalyst for action that leads to change, and to serve as a
            global connector of knowledge, learning, and innovation.
