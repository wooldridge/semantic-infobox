LABOR MIGRATION FROM BANGLADESH TO THE MIDDLE EAST&#13;
Since the mid 1970s, labor migration from South and East Asia to the&#13;
Middle East has been increasing very rapidly. It has many important economic&#13;
and social implications, including those for the balance of payments, spending&#13;
of migrant families, labor market, training needs, implementation of develop-&#13;
ment projects, domestic savings and investments and income distribution. The&#13;
undertaking of this study in Bangladesh was prompted by the lack of knowledge&#13;
about these various aspects and consequently about the costs and benefits of&#13;
labor migration.&#13;
The study was funded by the Bank Research Committee and is part of a&#13;
wider project which also includes Pakistan (Research Project 671-83). Most&#13;
of the work on Bangladesh was done through local research and under the guid-&#13;
ance of a local Steering Committee, which included representatives of the&#13;
various institutions associated with the study. It is hoped that this report&#13;
will be an incentive for further research on the subject and be a stimulus for&#13;
needed continued data gathering and re-examination of relevant policy issues.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
The migration on fixed-term contracts of Bangladeshi manpower&#13;
to Middle East is a comparatively recent phenomenon. However, in the&#13;
course of a few years the phenomenon has become so important, and the&#13;
flow of earnings so sizeable, that the subject has become worthy of&#13;
study and analysis. A research proposal to that effect was prepared&#13;
in Dacca, with the assistance of the Resident Mission of the World&#13;
Bank, and approved for financing by the Bank's Research Committee, in&#13;
September 1978.&#13;
In line with the World Bank's recent endeavor to have an&#13;
increasingly large share of research activities performed by institu-&#13;
tions in developing countries, the project was conceived as a purely&#13;
Bangladeshi research undertaking. The study was carried out, beginning&#13;
in December 1978, by a number of local institutions and organizations,&#13;
including the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET), the&#13;
Bangladesh Bank, the Planning Commission, the National Foundation for&#13;
Research on Human Resource Development and the Institute of Statistical&#13;
Research and Training, Dacca University. Coordination and guidance were&#13;
ensured by a Steering Committee, which included representatives of all&#13;
the institutions associated with the study.&#13;
Members of the Steering Committee were, apart from the authors&#13;
of the papers included in this volume: Professor Taherul Islam, Chair-&#13;
man of the Department of Economics, Dacca University, Mr. J. L. Kennedy,&#13;
Chief Technical Adviser to the BMET and Mr. A. Van Nimmen, Senior&#13;
Economist, World Bank Resident Mission. During the first year of the&#13;
study, the Steering Committee was chaired by Mr. A. M. A. H. Siddiqui,&#13;
then Director-General of the BMET, and presently attached to the Asian&#13;
Regional Project for Strengthening Labor/Manpower Administration, ILO,&#13;
Bangkok; during the final stages, the chairmanship of the Committee was&#13;
assumed by Professor Taherul Islam. The project Director was&#13;
Dr. A. K. Md. Habibullah, formerly an Assistant Professor of Economics,&#13;
Chittagong University, and at present Director, Research and Statistics&#13;
Division, Sonali Bank.&#13;
On behalf of the World Bank in Washington, the project was super-&#13;
vised and support provided by Mr. Marinus van der Mel, Senior Economist&#13;
in the South Asia Regional Office.&#13;
The eight papers prepared for the project and included in this&#13;
volume are:&#13;
Chapter I. "Development of Manpower Export and Profile of&#13;
Migrants from Bangladesh" is written by A. R. M. Anwar Hossain,&#13;
Director, Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training, Government&#13;
of Bangladesh. It traces the historical development of the Man-&#13;
power Export Policy of the Government over the years and presents&#13;
a profile of the characteristics of the migrants from Bangladesh,&#13;
based on information available from the Bureau, which is also used&#13;
in other studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ChaPter II. "An Analysis of the Influence of Home Remittances by&#13;
Bangladesh Nationals Working Abroad on the National Economy" is&#13;
a study written by Syed Ashraf Ali, Senior Assistant Controller,&#13;
Exchange Control Department, Bangladesh Bank. This study&#13;
focusses on the Wage Earners Scheme, the methods and channels&#13;
of remittance, their level, use and effects on financing of&#13;
imports, effects on money supply and inflation, etc.&#13;
Chapter III. "An Analysis of the Impact of Remittance Money on&#13;
Household Expenditure in Bangladesh" is written by Dr. Rizwanul&#13;
Islam, formerly Research Associate, National Foundation for Research&#13;
on Human Resource Development and at present Associate Professor&#13;
in the Department of Economics, Dacca University. Based on a sample&#13;
study of the households and their classification in terms of rural&#13;
and urban centres, remittance-receiving and non-migrants (therefore&#13;
non-remittance receiving) households, the spending behaviour and&#13;
consumption, savings and investment pattern are studied and analysed.&#13;
Charter IV. "Cost of Training of Bangladesh Miigrants to the M'iddle&#13;
Eastern Countries" is a study by Dr. Quazi Mafizur Rahman, Associate&#13;
Professor, Institute of Statistical Research and Training, Dacca&#13;
University. The study classifies the migrants into five major&#13;
occupational groups and estimates the current (or recurring) costs&#13;
of training of migrants, recurring cost of the employment exchange&#13;
programme and capital cost of the training of migrants and of the&#13;
employment exchange programme.&#13;
Chapter V. "Effects of Labor Migration on Manning of Production and&#13;
Service Establishments in Bangladesh" are analysed by Abu Ahmed Arif,&#13;
Deputy Chief, Socio-Economic Infrastructure Division, Planning&#13;
Commission, Government of Bangladesh. The study assesses the impact&#13;
of labor migration from Bangladesh with regard to 14 groups of educated&#13;
and skilled manpower in the national economy.&#13;
Chapter VI. "Projection of Mqanpower Demand in the Middle East and&#13;
the Prospects and possibilities of Manpower Export from Bangladesh"&#13;
is written by Dr. A.K.Md. Habibullah, formerly an Assistant Professor&#13;
of Economics, Chittagong University and at present Director,Research&#13;
and Statistics Division, Sonali Bark. The study analyses the existing&#13;
structure of the labor market in the Middle East, projects the future&#13;
demand pattern by country and occupation, and assesses the prospects&#13;
for supply of labour by skill and occupation from Bangladesh to the&#13;
Middle East.&#13;
Chapter VII. "Social Cost-Benefit Analysis of Manpower Export from&#13;
Bangladesh" is written jointly by Dr. W,iahiduddin M,ahmud, Associate&#13;
Professor, Department of Economics, Dacca University, and by Dr.&#13;
Siddiqur Rahman Osmani, Research Economist,Bangladesh Institute of&#13;
Development Studies. The paper deals with the theoretical issues of&#13;
cost-benefit analysis and estimates the benefits and costs of manpower&#13;
export to the economy of B ,ngladesh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter VIII. "Policy Recommendations and Implications for Promotingr&#13;
Idanpower  xcport from Bangladesh" is a study written by A.Ii.A.H.&#13;
Siddiqui, former Director-General of the Bureau of Manpower, EmDloyment&#13;
and Training, Dacca. Dr. Habibullah also contributed to Part C of the&#13;
study. The paper raises both procedural and policy issues and&#13;
recommendations with regard to manpower export from 3angladesh.&#13;
The various studies in this volume were written independently&#13;
by the authors and, though data and information were shared throagh&#13;
the Steering Committee, the studies were not conceived as carts of a&#13;
single piece of work. The task of editing the papers in order to&#13;
standardise the language and eliminate unnecessary duplications was&#13;
performed by Dr. Alimur Rahman, Associate Professor, Institute of&#13;
Business Administration, Dacca University. Kevertheless, since the&#13;
subjects treated are interrelated and strict comprartmentalisation&#13;
would have been artificial, there continue to be a number of overlaps.&#13;
One, therefore, should not expect the unity of thoaght that characterises&#13;
a book on the subject.&#13;
The authors gratefully acknowledge the great debt owed by them&#13;
to Professors J. R. Goodman and Steve Guisinger for valuable advice&#13;
given on statistical sampling methods and cost-benefit analysis methodology.&#13;
Typing of the final version of the report was very ably performed&#13;
by Ms. Jennifer Beckett, and by S.A. Khan.&#13;
The authors represent their area of expertise rather than the&#13;
agencies to which they belong and as such the usual disclaimer about&#13;
errors and omissions applies.&#13;

SU1I'ERY&#13;
I. Development of Manpower Export and Profile of Migrants from Bangladesh&#13;
s.1    The major manpower problems in Bangladesh are huge unemployment&#13;
and underemployment, unemployment among educated youth, high rate of&#13;
population growth and, as a consequence, increase of the labor force,&#13;
low capacity of the economy to produce jobs and failure of the First Five&#13;
Year Plan to create the 4.1 million jobs forecast. Because of the&#13;
deteriorating unemploymenit situation, labor migration to the Middle East&#13;
started almost automatically.&#13;
s.2    Early migration (before 1972) helped greatly in creatinfr a market&#13;
for Bangladeshi workers in the Miiddle East. During 1972-75 several unofficial&#13;
delegations from the Middle East visited Bangladesh to recruit manpower.&#13;
This unofficial recruitment gave rise to many malpractices. Initial efforts&#13;
to develon an effective government manpower export policy were not very&#13;
successful. To improve this situation, in 1976 the Bureau of Manpower,&#13;
3nployment and Training (BMET) was created. BMET, however, has to perform&#13;
a variety of functions and manpower export constitutes only some 10%,' of its&#13;
overall activities.&#13;
s.3    BMET is responsible for processing all demands from foreign employers,&#13;
except recruitment of seamen and international organizations. Under it, the&#13;
employment exchanges have a foreign employment cell where a re-ister is held&#13;
of overseas job seekers. BIMET itself holds a master register which includes&#13;
in addition to the job seekers identified through the employment exchanges,&#13;
those appearing on surplus lists of public, sector enterprises.&#13;
s.4    Besides BHET, there are five other channels of recruitment, namely:&#13;
(a) licensed recruiting agents known as passage brokers;&#13;
(b) private parties securing ad-hoc permission from BIdET;&#13;
(c) individual effort (persons obtaining jobs through relations&#13;
and friends already in the Middle East);&#13;
(d) foreign missions in Bangladesh; and&#13;
(e) Bangladeshi firms securing contracts for work in the&#13;
Middle East.&#13;
During 1976 through April 1979,  34% of a total of 58,100 registered&#13;
migrants to the Middle East were recruited through BMET, 8% through&#13;
recruiting agents and 58 through individual effort.&#13;
s.5    BMET does not require a fee from the employer for its services. In&#13;
contrast, private agents receive a commission from employers. The agents&#13;
are held to recruit from among candidates registered with employment&#13;
exchanges, but this rule is violated on a large scale. Agents are also&#13;
held to deposit a sum of Tk.50,000 as a guarantee for good conduct. In&#13;
practice, of 271 registered agents, only some 10% have managed to be an&#13;
intermediary for genuine employment demands more than once.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
s.6    The direct recruitment efforts of some foreign missions (embassies in&#13;
Bangladesh) reflect a lack of confidence in BHYT's ability to ensure the&#13;
fair selection of candidates.These efforts are tolerated, in the interest of&#13;
securing additional jobs. There are now 12 Bangladeshi firms wo-rking! in the&#13;
Mliddle East, mostly sub-contractors, who have recruited 3,600 mie-rants.&#13;
s.7    As basis for negotiations, the salary demanded in the I2.iddle East&#13;
for professionals and skilled workers is 6-8 times and that for unskilled&#13;
workers 5-6 times that in Bangladesh. Each worker is obliged to remit 252'&#13;
of his salary, but this is difficult to enforce.&#13;
s.8    31ET is operating under very difficult circumstances. It has highly&#13;
insufficient office space, is seriously understaffed, the public is not&#13;
properly informed about employment opportunities and the records of BEET&#13;
are not in proper order. Xalpractices in recruitment in the Bureau have&#13;
occurred and recruitment agents are known to have exploited job seekers.&#13;
s.9    Migration policies need to be improved through a Master Plan which&#13;
should include the following elements:&#13;
(a) Revision of the Migration Act of 1922;&#13;
(b) Establishment of a lanpower Export Authority. This would take&#13;
over the manpower export function of BMEI-  and is under&#13;
consideration by the CGovernment. It would have a commercial&#13;
outlook and be financed separately. f2 similar or&#143;anizatiCn,&#13;
named Overseas 3mployment Develo,&lt;,ment Board, exists in the&#13;
Philippines;&#13;
(c) :To restrictions on individual migration effortsx&#13;
(d) Establishment of a network of employment offices .1iS is also&#13;
(   under consideration. It would include district offices in&#13;
Bang;ladesh and regional offices in the Middle East. Its functions&#13;
would include placement, vocational guidance and training, and&#13;
labor market intelligence;&#13;
(e) Establishment of a .anpower .'esearch Institute;&#13;
(f) Dissemination localLy of special skills acquired abroad. This&#13;
was done in Turkey -hrough brief courses;&#13;
(C) Developin- a scheme for better use of remittances.&#13;
s.10    On December 1, 1979 about 166,000 persons had registered with&#13;
employment exchange for foreign employment. The Government has been giving&#13;
increasing attention to technical training. A large number of new private&#13;
training institutions of low quality has also emerged.&#13;
s.11    Information on the profile of migrants was obtained from the records&#13;
of' BMIl using a 104 sample of those who left during 1977 and 1978; on this&#13;
basis, details could be obtained for 3,572 migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
s.12    By skill distribution, 71.8% of the sample consisted of workers&#13;
in construction (by far the largeot category), transport and production.&#13;
Professional workers (engineers, doctors and others) comprised 5.4,o&#13;
technical workers 2.6` and service workers 8.4,. The great majority (82.3%o)&#13;
are below secondary level of education. The higher the skill, the better&#13;
the prospect of employment. Two-thirds had contracts for one year and one-&#13;
third for two years. Professional migrants had longer contracts as compared&#13;
to other migrants.&#13;
s.13    Two-thirds of migration took place to UAZ (32.3/%) , Oman (12.7%6),&#13;
Saudi Arabia(12.6-')and Kuwait(9.1%).Over one-half of the migrants came&#13;
from only three districts, namely Chittagong, Dacca and Sylhet. IIost&#13;
migrants are rural (77.8%D); Dacca is an exception with 57.3%O coming from&#13;
urban areas.&#13;
s.14    Employers have a great preference for a-es 20-35 which represented&#13;
82.6% of the employed, as a ainst 10.4'" in the 36-40 age group. The&#13;
majority of migrants (88.8%) were employed in t he private sector, but public&#13;
employment in all countries under study claimed personnel with greater skills.&#13;
s.15    The fact that UAP  is the maximum importing country and the district&#13;
of Chitta,ong the maximum labor exporting area in Bangladesh, probably has&#13;
historical reasons; earlier migrants were able to help friends and relatives&#13;
in findinFc employment. Dacca is statistically overstated because many job&#13;
seekers register under a Dacca address to get chances for foreign employment&#13;
more cuickly. The concentration of migrants in few districts is also caused&#13;
by the limited itinerary of recruiters and the short notice of their arrival.&#13;
s.16    There is a need for reorienting training to meet the demand for&#13;
specific skills; at present a large part of education is too general and&#13;
non-technical. Labor attaches abroad could be helpful in identifying specific&#13;
needs. Bangladesh could also better exploit its traditional links with the&#13;
A;rab world, for employment purposes.&#13;
s.17    More constru-ction contracts in the Middle East of Bangladeshi firms&#13;
would be especially conducive to greater migration, but lack of financial&#13;
resources is an impediment to obtaining such contracts. Trainin,- facilities&#13;
need to be increased for a number of critical trades; informal and&#13;
apprenticeship training offer the best prospects. Legal apprenticeship&#13;
training requirements which exist for larger establishments presently are&#13;
not being enforced.&#13;
s.18    During 1977-78, Bangladesh filled 0.89,% of the total new expatriate&#13;
labor reouirement in the Middle East. Applying the same percentage (refined&#13;
by major occupation groups) to labor requirements during 1980-85 as estimated&#13;
by the -TTorld Bank, the result is that migration from Bangladesh during this&#13;
period would amount to 165,000 (gross). If one assumes a continuation of the&#13;
growth rate of 7.35%' for Bangladeshi migration in 1979, the gross total during&#13;
the six-year period could reach 189,700. A third projection, based on a share&#13;
of 1 .035 (observed for 1979) leads to a total of 191 ,400 gross.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv&#13;
s.19    It is assumed that about 20% of migrants might come back every&#13;
year from 1980 onwards. Two estimates of the number of migrants in the&#13;
Middle East in 1985 are 169,900 and 141,200 respectively. These various&#13;
totals might be exceeded if the World Bank estimates would be too low&#13;
and/or Bangladesh would manage to expand its share above that assumed in&#13;
the projections.&#13;
II. Influence of Home Remittances on the Economy&#13;
s.20    Home remittances are the second largest foreign exchange earner&#13;
after jute products. In FY79, receipts from remittances plus the value of&#13;
goods imported under the Wage Earners' Scheme (WES) amounted to Tk. 2,430&#13;
million (almost $160 million). This does not include imports by migrants&#13;
under personal baggage rules.&#13;
s.21    The WES was introduced from mid-1974.  It is based on the same&#13;
principle as the Bonus Voucher Scheme existing in Pakistan in the 1960s.&#13;
WES enables wage earners to sell their foreign exchange in Bangladesh to&#13;
importers at a premium over the official rate and thus provides an&#13;
incentive to use official channels for sending money home. Nevertheless,&#13;
some foreign exchange is sold by migrants abroad against Takas at a&#13;
premium, enabling residents of Bangladesh to transfer funds out of the&#13;
country illegally. Foreign exchange offered under the WES is auctioned&#13;
daily. It makes possible imports of goods and services not allowed&#13;
otherwise. Funds deposited under WES may also be re-exported.&#13;
s.22    Statistics of migrants' remittances are incomplete because prior&#13;
to August 1978 no records were kept of migrants' funds used directly to&#13;
finance imports. Since August 1979, such shipments have been largely&#13;
disallowed. Because of this and the continued outflow of workers,&#13;
remittances through official channels in 1979 were estimated to rise to&#13;
Tk.3 billion (about $200 million).&#13;
s.23    Factors which might raise the future level of remittances include&#13;
increased earnings levels of migrants, higher savings, larger flow of&#13;
returnees,   government policies, the economic and political outlook of the&#13;
country and the removal of UK exchange controls. Assuming a growth rate in&#13;
1980 of 25%, in 1981 of 20% and in 1982-85 of 15%, world wide remittances&#13;
to Bangladesh in 1985 could reach Tk.7,870 million (or some $500 million).&#13;
Workers from the Middle East collectively now remit more than those from&#13;
the UK; also, statistically the UK share is overstated because many Middle&#13;
East workers remit through London.&#13;
s.24    Bangladesh Bank conducted a special survey of 720 foreign currency&#13;
accounts opened through 1978 under the WES (about 2% of the total). The&#13;
survey indicates that accounts are heavily concentrated in Dacca, because&#13;
facilities available in other centers are few. From 1977 onwards the&#13;
number of accounts rose rapidly because of special efforts. Most accounts&#13;
are held by professionals and technicians. Migrants in UAE have relatively&#13;
few accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v&#13;
s.25     Ilost foreign exchange under WES is sold by intermediaries. A&#13;
special committee,set up in 1977, auctions foreign exchange on behalf of&#13;
migrants without suitable relations in Bangladesh (about 15` of a-gregate&#13;
remittances). The premium under I7ES has averaged about 30j,. Foreign&#13;
exchange from remittances under 7TES is not a Dart of the common foreign&#13;
exchange pool of the country.&#13;
s.26     Bangladesh Bank also did a survey of the profile of 189 returning&#13;
migrants (mainly on vacation). ,ome of the major findings are the following:&#13;
(a) 20&gt;6 stayed more than two years;&#13;
(b) earnings in the Middle East were more than ten times those&#13;
in Bangladesh;&#13;
(c) migrants exhibited a strong propensity to save;&#13;
(d) 50" of remittances were through bank drafts;&#13;
(e) delays in remittances were very long, for drafts an&#13;
average of 37 days;&#13;
(f) the part of remittances invested went mainly into land and&#13;
buildings, agriculture accounting for only 1';&#13;
(g) over one-third would like to stay abroad longer than two&#13;
years.&#13;
s.27     One of the most serious problems faced by migrants in the Middle&#13;
East is inadequacy of remittance arrangements. One cause is insufficient&#13;
knoT.-ledge of remittance procedures. Needed is a publicity campaign covering&#13;
remittances themselves, and their disoosal and investment. Lack of&#13;
knowledge of Arabic, non-cooperation of foreign bank personnel and inadequate&#13;
telecommunication links are also major difficulties. Losses of remittances&#13;
apparently are large. -hey are encashed by fraudulent means, forged&#13;
signatures, paid to wrong persons, and families are also the victims of&#13;
threats, robbery, etc. Furthermore, domestic banks do not earn enough&#13;
handling remittances, which makes many of them disinterested. Disposal of&#13;
remittances equally entails substantial difficulties. Arrangements are not&#13;
widely known, banks work slowly, and brokers manipulate the price under the&#13;
53S to their advantage. Needed are effective steps such as periodic fixing&#13;
of floor and ceiling rates.&#13;
s.28     Exchange of remittances is generally not possible outside main&#13;
centers. It is therefore su-gested to issue to migrants drafts in Taka in&#13;
the Middle East. A further goin- step would be to issue to them Taka bonds;&#13;
these could bear interest pro,ressively higher for longer periods to&#13;
encourage savings.&#13;
s.29     Remittances may have an inflationary impact because of delay in&#13;
imports financed from the proceeds under lTES. Moreover, a good deal of&#13;
spending is concentrated on scarce luxury and other consumer items, land&#13;
and housing, with consequent strong price increases for these categories.&#13;
Very little interest exists as yet for investment in securities. `fhat this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vi&#13;
all adds up to is that at present almost the only economic benefit of&#13;
migrants' transfers is balance of payments support by way of enlarged&#13;
imports, but to a considerable extent resulting in conspicuous consumption&#13;
of luxury items.&#13;
s.30    Imports of goods eligible under the ,,,ES are unrestricted; no limit&#13;
exists for the quantity and value of goods that an individual merchant&#13;
can import. An analysis of the composition of imports reveals that in&#13;
1978 13% consisted of essential consumer goods, 17% of non-essential&#13;
consumer goods, 6% of capital goods and 64% of raw materials. Considering&#13;
that a large share of the latter eventually is converted into luxury goods,&#13;
altogether about one-half of imports under the  3ES goes to luxury items.&#13;
Moreover, this share appears tc be rising.&#13;
s.31    A special study appears in order to assess the effects of imports&#13;
under the TES on the economy. Unchecked imports retard growth and&#13;
expansion of local industries. Consumers develop a taste for imported&#13;
items. WES also defies the desirable objective of unifying the exchange&#13;
rate. Moreover, it diverts scarce foreign exchange away from otherwise&#13;
desirable investments and essential goods.&#13;
s.32    Examination of the average level of remittances per minrant&#13;
(Tk.990 per month) in relation to levels of earnings and savings in the&#13;
Middle East, reveals that Bangladeshi workers are remitting very&#13;
substantially below their potential. The obvious explanation is that a&#13;
sizeable share of earnings is diverted to the black market. This money is&#13;
used for financing of duty-free imports, smuggled items, to cover the&#13;
difference between invoiced and actual prices, and to finance illegal&#13;
capital exports.&#13;
s.33    There is therefore a need for new investment outlets within&#13;
Bangladesh to tackle the twin problems of too low workers' remittances&#13;
and non-productive use of these remittances. Assets presently available,&#13;
except prize bcnds, have little appeal for migrants. The odds are heavily&#13;
against attracting migrants' savings into productive channels. Nevertheless&#13;
a number of possibilities exist:&#13;
(a) Investment in industries; for this, establishment is&#13;
needed of a special agency to serve migrants;&#13;
(b) Prize bonds in larger denomination (say Tk.500); these could&#13;
be sold directly in the Xiddle East to migrants through&#13;
banks and foreign missions, and foreign currency would be&#13;
exchanged at WES rates;&#13;
(c) Savings certificates; these would again be provided directly&#13;
to Bangladeshi communities abroad on the basis of a special&#13;
campaign of the Saving Di-rectorate;&#13;
(d) Life insurance; the nationalized life insurance company (Jiban&#13;
Bima Corporation) should step up its promotion efforts among&#13;
migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vii&#13;
III. Impact of Renmittance Money on Household Expenditure&#13;
s.34    A study was made of the expenditure pattern of households receiving&#13;
migrant remittances from abroad in comparison with that of households not&#13;
recelving such remittances (the so-called control group). The basis for&#13;
selection of the households was the 10M  sample of migrant workers registered&#13;
with BMET (about 3,000 cases).&#13;
s.35    From this sample, a subsample was systematically drawn for 201&#13;
households of migrants in rural areas,. These belong-ed to eight thanas (two&#13;
for each of four selected districts). The number of households selected&#13;
for each of the eight thanas was proportional to the share of addresses&#13;
located in it (one of the thanas had only one selected address and was&#13;
deleted). The thanas chosen belonged to two g,roups, one with a hi7h and the&#13;
other with a low concentration of addresses. In some cases no respondent&#13;
was found at a given address and interviewers had to select a substitute&#13;
address.&#13;
s.36    For households in urban areas, 100 were selected in two districts.&#13;
Howrever, only 76 urban households were actually interviewed. For the control&#13;
group, households were selected in eoual number and f'rom the same locality.&#13;
The total sample thus was 554 households. The questionnaire for the household&#13;
survey was pretested in two rounds.  The survey itself met with various&#13;
difficulties, but the data generated appear to be of reasonably good quality.&#13;
s.37   INore than 70"O (in urban areas nearly 80) of the migrants were 20-35&#13;
years old. Nearly 6% of them were illiterate; one-third of them either&#13;
completed or entered the primary level; another third either completed junior&#13;
or the secondary level of education. Althlough less than 10%o of the migrants&#13;
were graduates, the proportion of total graduates that migrated appeared quite&#13;
high.&#13;
s.38    Before they migrated, nearly 29,-% of the migrants were either&#13;
unemployed or students. Another 31'% were unskilled. The impact on domestic&#13;
production therefore appeared small in respect of nearly 60C' of the migrants.&#13;
On the other hand, skilled wforkers, technicians and professionals constituted&#13;
30,'&#143; of the migrants. The costs associated with their migration can be quite&#13;
sigcnificant, bo-th in terms of the impact on production and the costs of&#13;
education and training.&#13;
s.59    The occupational distribution of migrants when abroad revealed that&#13;
a large number were workers for construction and infrastructure building,&#13;
both skilled and unskilled. Skilled workers, technicians and pofessionals&#13;
constituted  a much hi,sher share (nearly 60') of workers. It is possible&#13;
that they were able to find work abroad which will Crive them ,:-reater skills&#13;
when returning, but also that in Bangladesh they were unemployed or doing&#13;
work for which they were overqualified; even then, however, they gflot better&#13;
opportunities for preserving their skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
viii&#13;
s.40    Almost 85h of mi-rants worked in five Middle East countries (UAE,&#13;
Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and I'uw-ait), of which UAE alone accounted for&#13;
44%.. Tost minrants had Tnirrated only recently. Less than one-folrth were&#13;
staying abroad more than tlo years. Only 505 of migrants relied exclusively&#13;
on banks to remit money, while another 95 used banks alon  w,.ith pri.-ate&#13;
channels. As many as 35' relied exclusively on private channels (T'undi,&#13;
wTgs). In 7O0J of urban cases using banks, remittances reached the recipient&#13;
in less than three weeks. -?emittance moneY through private channels&#13;
arrived more quickly.&#13;
s.41    The income of remittance-receiving households was quite high (on&#13;
average, over Tk.5,000 in both rural and urban areas), rmuch hi-her than&#13;
the top decile of the national income distribution. Remittances were the&#13;
major source of income for most households (more than three-fourths for&#13;
625 of rural and 47&gt; of urban households). It appears that most of the&#13;
households from which workers migrated were in the middle or upper middle&#13;
income groups. It is difficult to find workers migrating from the poorest&#13;
or low income households. A preliminary hypothesis is that remittances&#13;
are helping households in the lower middle, middle and upper middle income&#13;
groups to move upw-ards in the income scale. In contrast, the poorer&#13;
households do not seem to have benefited much from migration.&#13;
s.42    The data from the household survey also indicate that remittance-&#13;
receiving households do not have a propensity to spend more on consumption&#13;
than their counterparts in the control group. On the contrary, their savinCs&#13;
were significantly hi_her than those of the other households, in both rural&#13;
and urban areas. For was a tendency noticeable for migrant families to&#13;
spend  relatively more on luxury rather than essential -oods. -he only&#13;
notable exceution was that migrant families did spend more than other&#13;
households on some consumer durables. It is possible that the mi.rant framilies&#13;
initially had lower incomes than those in the control ;roup and that when&#13;
their incomes rose due to remittances, they generally only caught up with&#13;
the control group as far as their detailed consumption exoenditure pattern&#13;
is concerned.&#13;
s.43    The miErant f[amilies did spend more on land and construction of&#13;
houses compared to the other households. The same was true for spending on&#13;
improvement and repair of housing in rural areas (but not in urban ones).&#13;
Direct questioning on the use of remittance money over a five-year tirre&#13;
frame also revealed that alto-ether, nearly one half of remittances was&#13;
spent on land and housing. A substantial part was also used for the repayment&#13;
of earlier debts. Very little was invested in activities like agriculture,&#13;
industry or business. It is clear, therefore, that remittances contributed&#13;
very little (at least directly) towards the creation of productive employment&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ix&#13;
IV. Cost of Training of Migrants&#13;
s.44    As part of the research project, a study was icade of the current&#13;
anc caital cost of (a) training prospective miigrants and their replacements&#13;
and (b) the employment exchange program. The selection of occupations and&#13;
institutions wvas done by sampling-, startin- from the 101' sample of&#13;
migrants drawvn from the records of B,TT. In all, '0C occupations were&#13;
identified, which were classified into five major occupajtional -;roups,viz.&#13;
professional, technical, skilled, semiskilled and unskilled . 7stimated&#13;
costs h:ave been shown separately for the different institutions bclong;ing&#13;
to a particular grouip.&#13;
s.45    In order to estimate total recurring cost, information was sought&#13;
from various institutions on the number of students enrolled and those&#13;
who finished their study,number of teachers and their salary, amount spent&#13;
on administrative and surnorting staff, etc. 'lo determine the current&#13;
cost of the employment exchange program, infoination was obtained on the&#13;
cost of administrative staff, supporting staff, allowances and honoraria,&#13;
etc. Capital cost was estimated on the basis of current market value of&#13;
fixed assets.&#13;
s.46    Recurring costs varied greatly among institutions. Generally,&#13;
teclinical institutions incurred more costs than nontechnical institutions.&#13;
The estimated cost of training agricultural professional graduates turned&#13;
out to be much higher than that of other groups, especially capital cost.&#13;
Price of land is an important factor. The agricultural college in Dacca&#13;
has a lot of farmland; its value is much higher than that of the agricultural&#13;
university in HIymensingh, the other agricultural institution sammpled.&#13;
V. Effects of Labor Migration on Manning of Production&#13;
and Service Establishments in Bangladesh&#13;
s.47    Bangladesh perhaps does not stand to lose anything substantial on&#13;
account of the migration of unskilled and semiskilled workers, because&#13;
the time and cost of training is small and they are easily replaced. The&#13;
large majority of employers interviewed agreed with this position. In the&#13;
case of export of educated and skilled manpower, it follows from interviews&#13;
that migration abroad has had a disadvantageous effect on the domestic&#13;
economy (both throu,h resulting vacancies and appointment of less-qualified&#13;
staff) in the following occupations: medical specialists, doctors and&#13;
technicians; engineering graduates, technicians and craftsmen: fibre&#13;
technologists; and agricultural professionals.&#13;
s.48    To assess the prospects  by 1983, two assumptions are made: a 50;J&#13;
and a 100-I increase respectively over the level of new job openin-s which&#13;
materialized during 1973-78. Additional supply can be estimated vith a&#13;
reasonable degree of accuracy on the basis of present enrollments. A mixed&#13;
picture emerges; in some occupational -roups, additional graduates are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
x&#13;
expected to be forthcoming in sufficient numbers to prevent shortages, in&#13;
others not. A complicating factor is that in numerous cases positions&#13;
presently are filled by persons who are undercualified or have been trained&#13;
for different occupations. These effectively block the entrance of newly&#13;
trained persons into jobs for which they are fully qualified.&#13;
VI. Prospects for Manpower Export frqrm Bangladesh to the Middle East&#13;
s.49    As a result of rapid development,more than half of the total labor&#13;
force of the Arab countries is corlprised of foreign workers.&#13;
s.50    The existing structure of the labor market in the IIiddle East is&#13;
characterized by a widespread demand for a larZe variety of skills. In&#13;
most countries, development has focussed primarily on the develoament of&#13;
physical and social infrastructure. These activities mainly in-Lrolved&#13;
construction,resulting in the demand for construction workers. A diversified&#13;
demand for specialized skills and services is gradually being created in&#13;
the health, educaticn and urban sectors. Because of the short,ae of basic&#13;
infrastructure, the develo-ment of industries and agriculture has been&#13;
rather slow. WTithin this broad pattern, sig,nificant differences exist among,^&#13;
individual countries.&#13;
s.51    Some of the MIiddle gast countries are simultaneously labor ex-.Crters&#13;
and importers. Labor export is compensated by cheaper labor _72port from non-&#13;
Arab countries. The largest proportion of specialize-d and skilled wo-kers&#13;
come from Europe and America. Unskilled laborers come, by and large, from&#13;
Yemen Arab Republic and Oman, while the majority of manual laborers arc&#13;
imported from India, PaListan and Bangladesh.&#13;
s.52    Information to estimate the magnitude and pattern of f'uture demand&#13;
for manoower in the MIiddle East is limited. A projection made for 1980-85&#13;
by a World Bank research group indicates that although constructior will&#13;
remain the large.t sector for labor imported from outside the area, its&#13;
relative importance will decline. In contrast, demand for expatriate&#13;
labor in most parts of the- service sector, agriculture and manufacturing&#13;
is expected to rise more rapidly, reflecting the trend towards greater&#13;
diversification of the economies. Related to these developrments, the demand&#13;
for labor with higher levels of skill is anticipated to increase propo_ tionately&#13;
more than that for sermi-skilled and unskilled workers. Altogether, the&#13;
`orld Bank study projects a compounded growth rate in demand3 -or labor from&#13;
outside the reg,ion of 7.5i&gt; rer annum over the five-year per:od for the nine&#13;
oil-exporting countries covered by the study.&#13;
s.53    The share o-f Bangladesh in labor irmported by the iMid'le East is&#13;
very  Q7lo  (about 2&lt;' in 1977) and the potential exists for a substantial&#13;
increase in labor migration from Bangladesh to the region, in both absolute&#13;
and relative terms. 3angladesh was a late starter in manpower export&#13;
promotion and its labor is probably among the cheapest to employ. It would&#13;
be useful to make a study of comparative wage levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
xi&#13;
s.54    The level of unemployment in Bangladesh is very high, also among&#13;
graduates and post graduates in both general and science education.&#13;
There is an acute shortage, however, of professionals, including doctors,&#13;
electrical and mechanical engineers, and technicians like electrical&#13;
foremen and overhead electricians.  Needed, tletefore, are changes in the&#13;
structure of training and education to better cater to existing needs and&#13;
an expansion of training facilities for those skills which are in short&#13;
supply.&#13;
s.55    It has also to be recognized that the manpower market in the&#13;
Middle East is highly competitive. A considerable part of the need in&#13;
countries with labor shortages is covered by migration among countries&#13;
within the Middle East itself. The developed countries also provide&#13;
labor, especially for the more highly skilled positions. Bangladesh has&#13;
moreover to compete with a large group of other Asian countries. The&#13;
total share of Asian countries in migration to the Middle East has been&#13;
rising strongly, from 18% in 1975 to 44% in 1977.&#13;
s.56    The future success of Bangladesh in establishing itself as a&#13;
labor exporter will also depend on quality control of the manpower&#13;
provided and the creation of effective manpower export promotion policies,&#13;
including the elimination of fraudulent practices.&#13;
VII. Social Cost-Benefit Analysis of Migration of&#13;
Bangladeshi Nationals to the Middle East&#13;
s.57    The total increase in the number of migrants (flow of migrants)&#13;
from Bangladesh to the Middle East during 1976-79, based on BMET records,&#13;
was 69.1 thousand. The 24.5 thousand migrants in 1979 included in this&#13;
total did not contribute to remittances during the whole year. It is&#13;
assumed that new migrant workers start remitting with a lag of one month.&#13;
This reduces the number of migrants during 1979 to an "effective" number&#13;
(from the point of view of measuring remittances) of 11.3 thousand and&#13;
the four-year total to 55.9 thousand (rounded to 56.0 thousand). This&#13;
is based on the further assumption that illegal migration is compensated&#13;
by returnees. A second estimate presented for the "effective" flow of&#13;
migrants during the four-year period is 61.6 thousand; it assumes net&#13;
migration to have been 10% higher than the official figure for gross&#13;
migration.&#13;
s.58    Similarly, two estimates are presented for 1976-79 for the break-&#13;
down of migration by categories of skill (profile of migrants). One is&#13;
based on BMET data (macro data), the other on the special household&#13;
survey undertaken for the migration study. The results are as follows&#13;
(in percent): professional 5.6-4.7; sub-professional and technical&#13;
5.1-5.1; skilled 31.3-48.5; semi-skilled and unskilled 58.0-31.4;&#13;
unemployed and unclassified 0.0-10.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
xii&#13;
s.59    Remittances are defined as those sent through official financial&#13;
channels plus Lhe direct import of goods thro-ugh the -ES. On this basis,&#13;
first world Wide remittances are shown for 1974 (Sep-Dec)-1979 using the data&#13;
of Bangladesh Bank. The next s-tep is, to estimate remittances from the&#13;
1Uiddle East only. Data directly available on this are not suitable because&#13;
part of remittances from the HMiddle East are channeled through the "Test.&#13;
Therefore, an indirect method is followed. The increase in worldwide&#13;
remittances in 1976-79 is assumed to result entir~ely from new mligration&#13;
to the Middle 2Mast. However, part of the increase was also due to higher&#13;
earninns levels of those already abroad (worldwide) in 1976. This element&#13;
is eliminated by use of the UIK wage index. After this correction, the average&#13;
monthly remittance per worker from the Middle 7.ast in 1979 w,as Tk.3,545 and&#13;
Tk.3,22M  for the two "effective" flows  of migrants mentioned above.&#13;
s .60    Another source of data on remittances is the household survey. ilThis&#13;
gives for 1979 a monthly average of Ti 3,111. Estimates of actlual remittance&#13;
are also cbecked a-ainst those for potential remittance (i.e. savings of&#13;
migrants). Potential remittance is estimated at Tk.3,220 and T'k.3,020 (for&#13;
low and high estimates respectively; tlce former estimate probably is too lowr&#13;
because of under-reportins of a Dart of savings remitted through unofficial&#13;
channels). tfill estimates are comfortably close to each other. The gap between&#13;
potential remittance and actual remittance is exl mined by (ii) unofficial&#13;
remittance and (ii) retaining of part of savin-s by mi&gt;rants.&#13;
s.61    Both average and marf;inal savings rates are hi-nher for remittance-&#13;
receiving households than for other households (control group).&#13;
s.62    The most important direct cost of miCration is the loss of production&#13;
as a conseauence of the loss of manpower. Ileasuring this loss of production&#13;
is fraught with a number of conceptual and empirical complexities. In case&#13;
of an unskilled laborer, output foregone is generally assumed equal to the&#13;
marginal product of labor in agriculture. 'or a skilled worker, the direct&#13;
cost can be any one of the following three: marginal product of the emi-ratin-&#13;
worker, cost of training the replacement or nil. The relevant considerations&#13;
are (i) whether training is on-Job or formal; (ii) whether training facilities&#13;
are being developed in anticipation of futture demand arising out of mi-ration&#13;
and (iii) whether the market is supply-constrained or demand-constrained.&#13;
s.63    ?or unskilled workers it is argued that mi-ration does not entail&#13;
any loss of domestic production, irrespective of wfhether they come from&#13;
rural Or urban areas. For semi-skilled workers the only relevant cost is&#13;
the partial loss of output during the period of training. This is estimated&#13;
at 50') (which they are paid in the Itraining period) of regular pay. For&#13;
skilled workers, because of the preponderance of on-job training, the cost&#13;
of these workers is also equated with the cost of such training.&#13;
Professionals and technicians are the only categories in short supply&#13;
relative to demand, and they acquire skill mastly through formal training.&#13;
A complicating factoT in estimating the cost of migration is long lags&#13;
between changes in demand for and changes in production of professionals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
xiii&#13;
s.64    To analyze the distributional consequences of migration, income&#13;
levels of migrants' families are needed both before and after migration.&#13;
Income levels before migration are estimated by first estimating the&#13;
incomes of migrants themselves (by different skill categories) and then&#13;
applying a multiplication factor to arrive at income for the whole&#13;
family. The results (at 1979 levels of earnings) are as follows:&#13;
professionals - Tk. 2,645; sub-professionals and technicians - Tk.1,668;&#13;
skilled - Tk. 977-1,445; semi- and unskilled - Tk.565-850. On the basis&#13;
of data collected by Bangladesh Bank and the household survey, the&#13;
following results are obtained for incomes of migrants' families after&#13;
migration: professionals - Tk.20,500; sub-professionals and technicians -&#13;
Tk. 10,100; skilled - Tk. 5,200; semi- and unskilled Tk.4,000. There is&#13;
probably some upward bias in the latter data.&#13;
s.65    Needed also is information on the average level of family income&#13;
in the national economy. Two estimates are presented for 1978-79: Tk.888&#13;
per month (based on the household income-expenditure survey of Bangladesh&#13;
Bureau of Statistics) and Tk.754 (based on national accounts). These two&#13;
estimates are compatible, because the former values agricultural ouptut&#13;
at retail prices and the latter at harvest prices.&#13;
s.66    Furthermore, estimates are derived for the net increase in&#13;
consumption of migrants' families resulting from remittances. The monthly&#13;
increases (at 1979 levels of earnings) arrived at are the following:&#13;
professionals - Tk. 5,740; sub-professionals and technicians - Tk.2,223;&#13;
skilled - Tk.856; semi- and unskilled - Tk.636. It appears that about&#13;
60-70% of the net increase in income is saved by migrants' families.&#13;
s.67    The cost-benefit analysis is made for one variant for each of&#13;
four categories of workers. The present value of net benefits (based on&#13;
a four-year stay, at 1979 prices) turns out to be as follows: semi-&#13;
skilled or unskilled worker - $5,340; skilled worker - $6,650; technical&#13;
and sub-professional worker - $9,372; and professional - $17,295.&#13;
VIII. Policy Recommendations and Implications&#13;
s.68    Despite the rapid increase in migration to the Middle East since&#13;
1976, Bangladesh still occupies one of the lowest positions as a supplier&#13;
of labor, and a strong effort will be needed to even maintain this low&#13;
position. Equally urgent is the task of attending to the problems&#13;
generated by the rapid outflow of workers. In the 1980's, competition&#13;
will become more severe because of the Middle East preference for Far&#13;
East countries and the emergence of China as a labor exporter. The&#13;
question is not whether Bangladesh should allow migration, but whether&#13;
it has the determination and capability to formulate and administer an&#13;
appropriate migration policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
xiV&#13;
s.69    The task involves, among other things: assessing demand abroad&#13;
and supply of suitable manpower at home; training; manpower planning to&#13;
cope with shortages at home; promotion abroad; procedures for quick&#13;
recruiting; orientation of migrants; safeguards to ensure fair working&#13;
conditions abroad; maximize remittances and their productive use; welfare&#13;
measures for dependents; streamlinirg procedures to reduce malpractices;&#13;
resettlement; defining the role of the public and private sectors in&#13;
promoting and processing of overseas employment; and institute machinery&#13;
to keep the situation under review.&#13;
s.70    The rapid rise in migration in recent years resulted in part from&#13;
a change in government attitude. But there were other contributing factors&#13;
also, namely the efforts of earlier migrants to promote the employment of&#13;
relations and friends, the desire of importing governments to diversify&#13;
sources   of supply, strong individual efforts and rising demand.&#13;
s.71    Positive measures taker by the government after 1975 include,&#13;
among' others, the posting of labor attaches abroad; creation of B'IET2 as&#13;
the central agency for labor export promotion; bilateral promotional&#13;
agreements witil Iran, Iraq and Libya, and agency agreements with prominent&#13;
foreign firms; sponsoring of promotional delegations; and effort aimed at&#13;
improving procedures.  espite these measures, many weaknesses in procedural&#13;
arrangements have remained, relatin- to information available to job seekers,&#13;
selection, recruitment, records, physical facilities, safe,guards by foreign&#13;
employers, guidelines on terms and conditions of foreign employment, etc.&#13;
Also, corrupt practices of middlemen,private recruiters, fore--n emp:loyers&#13;
and government officials, have remained wvidespread.&#13;
s.72    Improvements are necessary in the immediate future to relieve the&#13;
harassment of intended migrants, the gap between popular expectation and&#13;
realities, and the bottlenecks in processing prospective migrants. A long&#13;
list of detailed measures is offered to accomplish these boals. Someof&#13;
ther are: regular briefing sessions with the press; establisizent of&#13;
procedures that are well-documented, announced and adhered to -igidly;&#13;
subsidy to emoloyers for train ng replacements;establishmeent in 3hiT of a&#13;
separate foreign employment section and offices for welfare activities and&#13;
control of licensed rec-ruiters; and changes in the ,migraticn Act to combat&#13;
malpractices.&#13;
s.73    Improvements in institutional arrangements are needed for B11h]T and&#13;
private agents. A.t present, agents identify only few vacancies of their o-n&#13;
and workers are charged exorbi-ant fees. Instead, a fee ought to be charged&#13;
only from the employer. B!'i-T should no longer be plagued by outside&#13;
intervention in recruitment decisions. To decide whether the country can&#13;
release mrsons in key occupations, 3I3Ti should systematically assess foreign&#13;
demand, overall supply and specific supply in key occupations. In its&#13;
placement work,3IJ.T should provide a minimum service to foreign employers,&#13;
job seekers and private agents free of charge. It is desirable to have a&#13;
balanced development of BKTI2r and agents. Agents should be reg-istered for&#13;
full-time operation and be required to place major emphasis on identifyin-&#13;
ne- vacancies abroad; a minimum annual cerformance requirement should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
xv&#13;
established. Registration of temporary agents should be allowed only to&#13;
fill vacancies which come to Bangladesh in informal ways, namely from&#13;
Bangladeshis already in the Middle East.&#13;
s.74    As part of migration policy, Bangladesh should also explore&#13;
the demand potential for labor in regions other than the Middle East;&#13;
many possibilities exist. The number of Bangladeshis in the Middle&#13;
East is very small compared to that from other countries; probably not&#13;
more than 3%.&#13;
s.75    The number of workers abroad is also small in relation to&#13;
domestic employment in the modern sector. For 1978, it is estimated&#13;
at less than 3% of 2.0 million finding employment in that sector. There&#13;
is, however, an adverse impact in the services sector, including public&#13;
utilities, and in special cases such as highly specialized workers and&#13;
occupations requiring substantial training. Also, migration in some&#13;
instances may have affected the quality of the present work force.&#13;
s.76    Health services appear to have suffered from a substantial outflow&#13;
of doctors and nurses during 1976-79. Restrictions that were imposed have&#13;
gradually reduced the outflow. Needed is better manpower planning in the&#13;
health sector; this is needed regardless of migration as there is a&#13;
relative shortage of doctors and nurses in the countryside.&#13;
s.77    Among public utilities, the power-generating and distribution&#13;
sectors may have suffered to a larger extent than other sectors like&#13;
transport, telephone, telegraph and postal services. The problems of the&#13;
power sector are similar to those of the health sector. For all sectors&#13;
mentioned, and public sector corporations as well, the key problem appears&#13;
to be inadequate manpower planning, including timely replacement training.&#13;
Without such training an effective migration policy cannot be sustained.&#13;
In the case of drivers, clerical, hotel, catering and construction workers,&#13;
new workers who replaced migrants have been of lower quality.&#13;
s.78    Foreign demand is largely limited to persons with several years&#13;
experience even in unskilled categories. In the construction and&#13;
manufacturing sectors, a large part of training is informal, taking place&#13;
on the job. Improved and expanded training facilities are needed here as&#13;
well. The personality development of unskilled workers should be a major aim.&#13;
To accomplish these objectives, The National gouncil for Skill Development&#13;
and Training might set up training committees.&#13;
s.79    Local wage increases are another possible adverse effect of foreign&#13;
employment. In Bangladesh, however, wages in the public sector, which covers&#13;
a large part of modern activities, are controlled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
xvi&#13;
s.80    Policymakers in Bangladesh have suggested a placement target for&#13;
migration to the Middle East of 100,000 workers annually. This target is&#13;
considered unrealistic. Instead, an estimate is presented for the next&#13;
five years (through 1985) of 218,000 or 43,600 annually. This estimate&#13;
is based on the assumption that during the next five years recruitment&#13;
in the Middle East of non-nationals will be at the same level as in&#13;
1975, and that Bangladesh will be able to secure 2O53 of the vacancies in&#13;
countries with which it has entered into bilateral agreements and 1Cf in&#13;
other countries. Much greater attention will have to be paid to the labor&#13;
market of in particular Saudi Arabia and Libya. Establishment of an&#13;
organization similar to the Korean Development Corporation (KODCO) which&#13;
undertakes construction work in the Middle East and promotes private&#13;
construction firms, may be considered. Adequate training will be a key to&#13;
success.&#13;
s.81    Remittances from the Pliddle East are much below their potential.&#13;
On the basis of certain assumptions it is calculated that during the first&#13;
half of 1979 worldwide remittances were only 39% of savings, and remittances&#13;
from the Middle East 31%. Even if actual savings of migrants would be only&#13;
one half of those estimated, actual remittances would still be substantially&#13;
below their potential. The monthly remittance performance by country&#13;
indicates a wide range, from 3466 for Saudi Arabia to $5 for Oman.&#13;
Remittances from Bahrain and UAE are also low, at S28 and 332 respectively.&#13;
This suggests that in some countries, especially Oman, Bangladeshis on their&#13;
own have accepted very low-paying jobs. Other causes of low remittances&#13;
from the Middle East include successful diversion of funds by middlemen&#13;
and lack of proper banking facilities. Remittance performance could be&#13;
improved by arranging for the transfer on pay-day of 75% of the salary in&#13;
foreign exchange directly to the worker's foreign exchange account in&#13;
Bangladesh. The appointment of banking attaches in the Middle East might also&#13;
be considered.&#13;
s.82    Use of remittances for productive purposes is limited by the smallness&#13;
of the amounts per worker and a lack of money market instruments which&#13;
provide yields higher than those in land and other real estate. Nevertheless,&#13;
a number of possibilities exist (for example, repair, maintenance and&#13;
engineering workshops, restaurants and trading stores). A financial&#13;
organization in the private sector may be considered to finance such projects.&#13;

CHAPTER I&#13;
DEVELOPMENT OF MANPOJER EXPORT AND PROFILE OF MIGRANTS FROM BANGLADESH&#13;
A.  Introduotion&#13;
1.1       The population of Bangladesh w as estimated to be 85.4 million in 1978&#13;
and it is increasing at a rate of 2.5% per year. j   It was estimated that in&#13;
1978 the labour force was 29.9 million and that this would increase steadily&#13;
during the next decade by 0.9 million per year. | There are no reliable&#13;
statistics about the actual volume of unemployment in the country but based on&#13;
a certain projection a rough estimate can be derived for 1977-78.&#13;

From the Table it is seen that the 1977-78 estimate of total unemployment in&#13;
the country is 8.1 million.  According to a further estimate the educated un-&#13;
employed is approximately 0.8 million in 1978. 3/&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1 .2      Major manpower problems in Bangladesh seem to be (a) huge unemployment&#13;
and underemployment, (b) unemp-loyment among educated youth, (c) high rate of&#13;
population growth and consesuent increase in the number of new entrants to&#13;
labour force, (d) low capacity of the national economy to produce jobs to re-&#13;
duce the back-log and (e) failure of First Five Year Plan to create the 4.1&#13;
million jobs forecast.  The unemployment situat on was gradually deteriorating,&#13;
consequently the flow- of labour migration to the Middle East started almost&#13;
automatically.&#13;
1.3       Results of different studies reveal that the Bangladesh labour market&#13;
h_s some paradoxes. For example:&#13;
(a)  According to a rough estimate, about 8.1 million people are&#13;
unemployed; but a survey in the establishments employing 20&#13;
and more workers conducted by the Bureau of Manpow^ier,&#13;
Employment &amp; Training (BMET) shows that the country has&#13;
over 50,000 posts 2  remaining vacant due to:  (i) aovern-&#13;
ment ban against filling the posts, (ii) delays in proces-&#13;
sing the vacancies by PSC/Ministry/Headquarter, etc., and&#13;
(iii) non-availabili-ty of manpo-w-er. These vacancies belong&#13;
-o all occupations, and. surprisingly the vacancies -which&#13;
could not be filled dSue to non-availability of manpower&#13;
include clerical and related posts as well.  While some of&#13;
the vacancies are of recent origin, some have been unfilled&#13;
for a long time. While during the last three years about&#13;
6o,000 people I have migrated to the Middle Eas-t for a job,&#13;
almost an equal numrber of mnfilled vacancies appear2 to have&#13;
been existing within the country.&#13;
(b)  A sample survey was conducted by BP'ET to ascertain the em-&#13;
ployability of the qualified trainees of the Technical&#13;
Training Centres of the BMET. It was found that 61% of the&#13;
qualified T.T.C. trainees were unemployed for one year, 29%&#13;
for two years and about 17% for three years and above.&#13;
Another BMET survey dated December, 1977 revealed that 30%&#13;
of the trained persons qualifying from different training&#13;
institutes faced unemployment, 1,409 Diploma holders among&#13;
them. On the other hand., BMET conducted still another survey,&#13;
Training Need Assessment Survey, which indicated that a sub-&#13;
stantial training problem exists within the country.  It has&#13;
been estimated that the total training requiremen-. that the&#13;
Technical Training Centres of the BIET will need to accom-&#13;
modate in the next five years appears to be 130,953 persons.&#13;
This figure does not include additional training requirements&#13;
that are likely to arise from development projects, from&#13;
enterprises employing less than 20 workers in urban and rural&#13;

areas, from public sector corporations and from overseas em-&#13;
ployment.  Another 59,946 persons will require up-grading&#13;
training during the next five years.&#13;
(c) Ever since Bangladeshi workers have been migrating to the&#13;
Middle East countries in a large number, academic circles&#13;
and the ne,cspapers have been criticizing the flow, calling&#13;
it a brain drain. Brain drain occurs :;hen professional&#13;
workers like engineers, doctors, scientists, economists,&#13;
university teachers, etc. migrate to foreign countries. A&#13;
study was undertaken by A.M.A.H. Siddiqui, Director General,&#13;
BYET which shows that people in the professional occupations&#13;
covered by two major categories, namely "Administrative,&#13;
Managerial and related" and "Professional, Technical and&#13;
related," yorkers are _rossly under-utilized within the&#13;
country. It was observed from the study that 63.3% of the&#13;
professionals were under-utilized and their talents were&#13;
being wasted. This phenomenon of internal brain drain is&#13;
suggested to be a more important problem than the external&#13;
brain drain.&#13;
(d) There is one more grave -eakness in the labour market; the&#13;
country's education planning is not related to the recruit-&#13;
ment needs of different employing establishments, resultin_&#13;
in a mismatch between the quality of the educated job-seekers&#13;
and the job requirements of the labour market.&#13;
B. Development of Migration, Related Organizations and Policies&#13;
1.4       This section provides a description of the historical development of&#13;
the different processes of migration (and related organisation) at different&#13;
times up to the present day, documents various measures undertaken and des-&#13;
cribe, the mode of migration and problems related to it.  It is based on&#13;
several interviews held with persons dealing with the subject and the documents&#13;
prepared from time to time by the Ministry of Manpower Development and Social&#13;
Welfare and the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET).&#13;
(i) Development of Migration&#13;
Migration from British India&#13;
1.5       The Emigration Act of 1922 indicates that substantial migration was&#13;
taking place from British India in the early period of this century. A study&#13;
of the Act shows that the emigration was mostly of unskilled cate ories and&#13;
such emigration was being -sponsored through private sectors.  The Act provided&#13;
for licensing 'Passage Brokers,' the precursors of present day recruiting agento.&#13;
The emirTation took place mostly by sea, in contrast to the present emigration&#13;
by air.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.6        It is not possible to estimate whether emigration of any significant&#13;
size took place from the territories now comprising Bangladesh.  It is believed&#13;
that most of the emigration took place to build railroads and other projects in&#13;
former British Colonies like Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Fiji Islands, Mauritiu ,&#13;
Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago. Judging from the impressions of the ethnic&#13;
compo&lt;ition of Indian-origin population of these countries, it appear  that&#13;
migrants from territories now comprising Bangladesh were very fei in number.&#13;
From an intervie.:- ith an official who dealt with this subject in the then central&#13;
government of Pakistan, it appears that except for a few cases in Mauritlus&#13;
and Trinidad-Tobago, there was no migrant population of Bangladesh origin in&#13;
other countries.  Migrants in most of these countries were frbm the southern&#13;
part of India.&#13;
I igration to the U.K.&#13;
1.7       As a Government policy, manpower export from Bangladesh on a large&#13;
scale can be traced to the British Emigration Act introducin   the system of&#13;
issuing employment voucher, to overseas work people seeking employment in the&#13;
U.K. The employment voucher system provided that anybody could apply for a job&#13;
in the U.K. stating his qualifications and experience on a special application&#13;
form supplied by the British Department of Employment through  Employment Ex-&#13;
changes. These forms were kept in safe custody by the managers of the Employ-&#13;
ment Exchanges -who w&gt;ould distr-bute them to the candidates applying for an&#13;
employment voucher.  These application forms had a special column for the man-&#13;
agers of the dealing Employment Exchanges in Bangladesh to comment on the&#13;
professional efficiency of the candidates and to authenticate she statement by&#13;
putting signatures and office seals on the form. The forms so filled in :ould&#13;
be sent back to the British Department of Employment which would make the final&#13;
selection and issue employment vouchers or correspond directly with the candi-&#13;
dates; other formalities like visas, etc. would then be automatic.&#13;
1.8       In the 1950s it was observed that the actual job offers were made&#13;
mostly for the lowJer professions under the employment voucher system and a&#13;
large number of labourers especially from the district of Sylhet emigrated to&#13;
the U.K.  In the 1960s the flow of emigration fell considerably and was restricted&#13;
to a limited number of profess-onals and skilled workers.  The processing of&#13;
employment vouchers ultimately came to an end, and the Employment Exchanges of&#13;
Bangladesh, which formerly handled the employment voucher cases, never dealt&#13;
with any after independence.&#13;
1.9       The signing of an employment contract stipulating the rate of salary,&#13;
period of contract, etc. was not a pre-requisite for an employment voucher.&#13;
Besides, as the vouchers were issued directly to workers sta-istics on the&#13;
number of such departures are not available.  It is assumed that thousands of&#13;
Bangladeshi nationals took this opportunity to go to the U.K.  Most of these&#13;
easy migrants obtained British citizenship by naturalization after 4 or 5 years&#13;
sn the U.K., and, although they migrated as labourers, most of them have since&#13;
switched over to various other profession- of -which catering claims the maximum&#13;
number.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Flow to the Middle East (period before 1972)&#13;
1.10      People originating from present day Bangladesh have been migrating to&#13;
oil-rich Middle East countries for the last twenty years.  Beginning in the&#13;
early sixties small numbers, mostly from the district of Chittagong, migrated&#13;
unofficially to Saudi Arabia and (satar.  Some of thee people .rho had been to&#13;
Saudi Arabia during the early sixties managed to obtain Saudi nationality;&#13;
they are no  found in differert occupations, including self-o,ned small businesses,&#13;
namely in Mecca snd Medina.  Tho_e rho went to  Qatar -re kno-wn to have found&#13;
work mostly in Doha Port and Qatar Navigation Department.&#13;
1.11      The flow of unofficial migration had been gradually increasing.  For&#13;
a long time it was a common phenomenon that people tr_velling to Saudi Arabia&#13;
with visit or Omra visas j  could manage to escape notice of the Saudi Immigra-&#13;
tion authorities and stay in the country. In due course they found employment&#13;
and were allowed to stay on even without any work visa.  In.pired by thi_ in-&#13;
dulgence of the Saudi authorities, Bangladesh nationals began to migr_te to that&#13;
country in an ever-increasing number, mostly .:ith the plea of performing Omra&#13;
or Haj. As no Muslim can be denied the religious right of performing Omra,&#13;
these Banglo.6-shi travellers could obtain temporary visa- for 15 days at Jedda&#13;
airport, thus entering the country. Then they looked for a job, most of them&#13;
found one.&#13;
1.12      As the demand for manpower in the Middle East was increasing and aS&#13;
the immigration rules continued to remain ineffective, Ban-ladesh nationals&#13;
beg3n to travel to all the Arab countries by -xhatever channels they could.&#13;
After entering one country, the maximum number of people enterin  throou ah Jedda&#13;
airport, and the others through Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports, they began to&#13;
move to the other neighbouring countries.  Some Bangladeshis even travelled to&#13;
Europe and other countries to finally land on Arabian soil.  *These people then&#13;
scattered themselves all over the Middle East looking for jobs. It is apparent&#13;
that mostly irregular means were adop-ed by these travellers.&#13;
1.13      Until the late sixties only a limited number of people from Bangladesh&#13;
wvere a-ware of the demand in the Middle East.  Pakistan, India and certain other&#13;
countries were, however, well acqfuainted with the need for manpower in the&#13;
Middle East countries. The Arabian labour market recruited -orkers from India,&#13;
Pakistan and many other countrie . By virtue of having the maximum number of&#13;
!orkers there, Pakistan and India had a strong bargaining position in the Arabian&#13;
countries. While this was the situation, a small number of Bangladeshi Dorkers,&#13;
who made their entry to different Middle East countries through various unofficial&#13;
channels, were available to the employers at cheaper rates.  The Bangladeshis&#13;
jere found to be hard-working, disciplined and more productive and this burned&#13;
the attention of the Arabs to;ards Bangladesh.   Followring the e events Arabian&#13;
employers be an to send their delegations to Bangladesh looking for .zrorkers.&#13;
The matter then gradually drew the attention of the Government of the neJly&#13;
independent Bangladesh.&#13;
1.14      The early migrants helped greatly in creating a market for Bangladeshi&#13;
workers in the Middle East, and enhanced the flo-w of migration in mary ways.&#13;
9' Omra is a pilgrimage outside the season of the Haj.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  6-&#13;
Firstly, they took enormous trouble to reach the country of sheir demand and to&#13;
find employment through their own efforts, -which set an example for those -wTho&#13;
follo-wed.  Secondly, they made their services available to the employers at&#13;
lowrer cost than that of the other workers.  Thirdly, they pleased their employers&#13;
by their manners and output wr-hich created an Jmage and made the employers feel&#13;
confident about the Bangladeshi- workers.  Fourthly, they maintained a link with&#13;
their homeland and kome of them successfully negotiated deals rith their&#13;
employers inviting them to recruit workers from Bangladesh. Initially the early&#13;
migrants -were the only source which linked the Middle Eastern employers with the&#13;
workcers in Bangladesh.  The migrants made publicity to their employers about the&#13;
manpower resources in Bangladesh and arranged to supply cheap labour either&#13;
themselves or through their relations and friends at home.&#13;
Flow to the Middle East (1972-75)&#13;
1.15      Quite fresuently unofficial delegations from the Middle East visited&#13;
Bangladesh and recruited manpower, the highest number visiting Bangladesh during&#13;
the period from 1972 to 1)75.  It was only when these employers and their re-&#13;
cruits fell prey to the cheats that interference of Government agencies in&#13;
Bangladesh was necessary, The Bangladesh Government came to know about the re-&#13;
cruiting teams and were convinced of the need to come for-ward to assist them.&#13;
Some delegations were, however, compelled by the police to leave the country&#13;
because of malpractice.&#13;
1 .1 5    Mostly the unofficial recruiting delegatians consi ted of certain&#13;
categories of people, namely:  (a) the employer himself, (b) his legal representa-&#13;
tive, (c) a representative of a foreign firm working in the Middle East,&#13;
(d) a Bangladesh national in the Middle East, usually an old employee authorised&#13;
by his employer to recruit Bangladeshi -rorkers, or (e) a labour supplier or&#13;
agent, usually an Indian or Pakistani,  -ho had a contract from an employer to&#13;
supply -orkers.  These delegates, like adventurers, mide recruitment drives in&#13;
Bangladesh, and after recruiting the re:luired -work people, they carried their&#13;
passports to India, Pakistan or any other co-antry to obtain visas.  Until recently&#13;
no Middle East countries had embassies in Bangladesh, so visas for the recruits&#13;
had to be obtained from the recruiting countries' forei_n missions outside&#13;
Bangladesh.  Sometimes the delegates travelled to Thailand, Malaysia, Lebanon,&#13;
U.K., etc. to obtain such visas because of the heavy demand for overseas jobs.&#13;
1.17      Unofficial recruitment for foreign employment soon led to corruption.&#13;
Firstly, private individuals wTo -were instrumental in provicing a job or in-&#13;
viting employers began to realise illegal money from the current recruits as&#13;
-,well as the prospective candidates aspiring for an overseas job. Secondly,&#13;
visiting labour contractors began -o exploit the people by taking money and&#13;
promising them a job; suite often these contractors escaped with the money and&#13;
never care back.  Thirdly, job-seekers were exposed to harassment and exploitation&#13;
by unscrupulous people in the Immigratlion and Passport Departments, travel&#13;
agencies, middlemen, etc.  Fourthly, the terms and conditions of employment were&#13;
one-sided, favouring the employers only.  This ultimately led to strife between&#13;
the employers and the employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  7  -&#13;
1.18      Under these condition-, certain employers showed interest in recruiting&#13;
throu ,h the Government of Bangladesh and sent their recruiting delegations to&#13;
Government agencies, making previous contact -ith the Bangladesh ilissions&#13;
abroad. The Government met their demands through the Employment Exchanges.&#13;
The Policy of ManpoTer Export&#13;
1.19      Almost ,imultaneously the Bangladesh Government adop` mAd certain&#13;
policies to encourage the emigration of Bangladeshi - orkers to the Middle East&#13;
on one hand, and arrest malpractice committed by the foreign delegations and&#13;
middlemen on the other hand.&#13;
(a)  In 1976 the M1inistry of Labour and Social Welfare published a&#13;
booklet entitled "Profiles of Manpower Resources of Bangladesh"&#13;
to introduce the different categories of skills that were&#13;
available for export from Bangladesh. These booklets were&#13;
circulated to the Middle East countries through the Bangladesh&#13;
sissions abroad, and employers found them useful.&#13;
(b)  Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of&#13;
Labour and Social Welfare req-uested the Bangladesh 7is-ions&#13;
abroad to check, while issuing visas, on the purpose of&#13;
foreigners visiting Ban ladesh, and to alert the Ministry of&#13;
Labour beforehand by telex or by sending information in the&#13;
diplomatic bag if any visits were related to manpower re-&#13;
cruitment.  The missions were also requested to furnish&#13;
prior information to the Ministry of Labour and Social Wel-&#13;
fare with as many details as possible about the requirements&#13;
of the employers desiring to recruit Bangladeshi workers.&#13;
(c)  Employment Exchanges (then five in number, i.e. Dacca,&#13;
Chittagong, Khuina, Rangpur and Sylhet) were asked to line&#13;
up prospective c,ndidates seeking overseas employment.&#13;
(d) Considering the fact that a number of middlemen were already&#13;
in contact with foreign employers and that they had a sub-&#13;
stantial demand at hand, the Government recognised such&#13;
middlemen by giving them Recruiting Licences in an effort to&#13;
prevent undesirable persons from dealin  with foreign vacancies.&#13;
No rules of conduct were prescribed for the Recruiting Agents,&#13;
although certain standards were laid dowrn for appointing&#13;
the Recruiting Agents:&#13;
(i)    The Recruiting Agents should be prudent persons.&#13;
(ii)   They should possess demands for manpower at hand or&#13;
have a link with prospective employers desiring to&#13;
recruit manpovT;r from Bangladesh, and they should&#13;
produce documentary evidence of this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  8  -&#13;
(iii)  They should no-4 charge any fee from the candidates&#13;
applying for a job, but might realize commissions&#13;
from the employers for recruiting people for them.&#13;
(iv)   They were recjuired to deposit wsith the Ministry of&#13;
Labour a security deposit of Tk. 5,000 (now ralsed&#13;
to Tk. 50,0C0) to obtain a licence.&#13;
In many cases, these standards were enforced.&#13;
(e)  Persons proceeding to foreign employment through individual&#13;
efforts continued to remain unrestricted.&#13;
1.20      The above Government policy of manpower export was, however, found&#13;
inadeaouate, for the following reasons:&#13;
(a)  The criteria for registration of job-seekers at the Employ-&#13;
ment Exchange were not ?ixed, and as a result hundreds and&#13;
thousands of people were registered, including those pos-&#13;
sessing skills which were not wanted abroad.  Employed&#13;
people were also registered indiscriminately regardless of&#13;
whether they might face difficulties in obtaining a release&#13;
from their employers on being selected for foreign employ-&#13;
ment.&#13;
(b)  Due to flexible conditions, recruiting a ents gre-w 1ike&#13;
mushrooms and middlemen continued to exploit the prospec-&#13;
tive migrants in as many ways as they could.&#13;
(c)  The volume of Twfork in the Ministry increased beyond its&#13;
capacity.  In addition to policy-making, the M1in-itry took&#13;
up the responsibility of public relations, protocol duty&#13;
and matching candidates a;ainst jobs for -w;hich they were&#13;
neither equipped nor had the required professional training&#13;
and experience.&#13;
(d) sNo definite policy was adopted for expeditious emigration&#13;
clearance. The issuance of a passport would take as least&#13;
three months time.  Departure of finally selected candidates&#13;
was entirely dependent on the wishes of the Immigration&#13;
Officers. Due to inexperience and staff shortage in the&#13;
Ministry, clarifications on even trifling matters became&#13;
time consuming processes.&#13;
(e)  The migrants travelled mainly by air transport and both the&#13;
employers and the recruits faced great difficulties in that&#13;
the travel agents, instead of extending help, caused dif-&#13;
ficulties with a view to maximising their profit.  Bangladesh&#13;
Biman was sometimes helpful but they operated on a limited&#13;
number of routes with a small number of flights.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  9-&#13;
(ii) Organisation of Migration to the Middle East&#13;
1.21      In underdeveloped and developing countries generally the institutions&#13;
for manpowrer development and employment promotion are not properly organised.&#13;
The task of manpower development and employment promotion in Bangladesh&#13;
suffered greatly under Pakistani rule, and an organisation for implementing&#13;
the manpower policy in Bangladesh was conspicuous by its absence. However,&#13;
a small Manpower and Employment Wing in the East Pakistan Directorate of Labour&#13;
looked after the tasks of manpower development and employment promotion.  It&#13;
was too much to expect from the Directorate of Labour whose main preoccupation&#13;
',as with industrial relations and labour grelfare. After independence, there-&#13;
fore, the Government decided to make up for the years of neglect by creating&#13;
an independent organisation under the Ministry .o deal  ith Manpower, Employ.&#13;
ment and Training matters.&#13;
The Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training&#13;
1.22      The Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Tr-ining (BMET) was created&#13;
by splitting the Manpower and Employment Wing of the  Directorate of Labour.&#13;
The Bureau was given the functions of Manpower Development and Employment&#13;
Promotion while it was also made responsible for the task of exporting manpower&#13;
to the Middle East and other countries. Although the Bureau of Manpower is&#13;
now better kno-wn to the people for exporting manpower, the Bureau still has&#13;
more important functions to fulfil; manpower export constitutes barely 1 % of&#13;
its overall activities. These activities are enumerated below:&#13;
(a)  The Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training runs a train-&#13;
ing programme with a Marine Diesel Training Centre at&#13;
Narayang nj, offering diploma and certificate level courses;&#13;
and four Gechnical Training Centres (two in Dacca, and one&#13;
each in Chittagon  and Rajshahi) all offering craft level&#13;
certificate cour es in different trades. Eight more training&#13;
centres are being constructed.&#13;
(b)  An Apprenticeship Trainin_ Programme is located in employing&#13;
establishments with three administrative offices ut Dacca,&#13;
Chittagong and Khulna.&#13;
(c)  An Employment Counselling and Placement Service in nine&#13;
Employment Exchanges serves Dacca, Chittagong, Khulna, Rangpur,&#13;
Sylhet, RajThahi, Barisal, Noakhali and Mymensingh and has&#13;
three more branch offices at Narayanganj, Dinajpur and Bogra.&#13;
(d)  A Vocational Guidance and Career Planning Service has four&#13;
offices at Dacca, RBjshahi, Khulna and Chittagong.&#13;
(e)  The Bureau has a Self-Employment king for assisting educated&#13;
and trained manpower to enter self-employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(f) A Labour Market Information Wing collects and disseminates&#13;
employment and unemployment data on a regular basis to support&#13;
the foregoing programmes.&#13;
New Elements in the Manpower Export policy&#13;
1.23      Bangladesh has not yet developed a comprehensive lManpower Export&#13;
Policy; but rules of business are available in different Government orders,&#13;
directives and circulars.  Con-tinuous experiments are going on and the&#13;
Government has brouaght new inputs into the policy every now and then.  By the&#13;
time the Bureau of Manpower -Tas established the Government had already gained&#13;
some experience in the manpower export business, and by establishing the Bureau&#13;
the (Tovernment improved the institutional arrangements to promote employment&#13;
of Bangladeshis abroad on a selective basis:&#13;
(a)  For the first time the Government realised the need for man-&#13;
power export to earn foreign exchange on one hand and relieve&#13;
the pressure of unemployment in the domestic labour market on&#13;
the other hand; it decided to offer recruitment opportunities&#13;
for foreign employment to persons with requisite qualificatio:as&#13;
and experience only.&#13;
(b)  The Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training was made res-&#13;
ponsible for processing all demands from foreign employers&#13;
except for recruitment of seamen j and appointments in interna-&#13;
tional organizations. j By this process Bangladeshis seeking&#13;
employment abroad through any recruiting medium would require&#13;
clearance from BMET.&#13;
(c)  All the Ministries -,,;ere requested to encourage the Government&#13;
policy of manpower export and prepare a list of surplus man-&#13;
power in each Ministry and to send these lists to the Bureau&#13;
of Manpower for referral to overseas vacancies.&#13;
(d)  All Employment Exchanges opened a Foreign Employment Cell and&#13;
systematically started to register the names of overseas job-&#13;
seekers -w,Tho either (i) had technical qualifications or were&#13;
construction workers or caterers, or (ii) had three years&#13;
working experience in their respective trades.  Employed per-&#13;
sons were required to produce "no objection" certificates from&#13;
their employers, while unemployed persons were to produce a&#13;
certificate from gazetted officers confirming their unemploy-&#13;
ment status.  The applications thus received by the 3mployment&#13;
Exchanges were to be sent to the BMET periodically for recording&#13;
and referral.  A registration fee of Tk. 10 was charged from&#13;
each foreign employment application at the Employment Exchange.&#13;
/  The recruitment of seamen is the responsibility of the Directorate of&#13;
Shipping.&#13;
2   The Establishment Division of the Ministry of Cabinet Affairs is respon-&#13;
sible for recruitment to International Organisationo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Four more Employment Exchanges and two branches were opened&#13;
at Barisal, Mymensingh, loakhali, Rajshahi, Bogra and&#13;
Dinajpur under a development project approved in 1977 for&#13;
the promotion of foreign employment.&#13;
(e)  BMET compiled a Majster Register wherein they collected and&#13;
recorded the particulars of overseas job-seekers applying&#13;
through the surplus lists of the different Mini-tries and&#13;
the registration channel of the Employment Exc:anges.  This&#13;
compilation is a continuous process; EMET was given addition-&#13;
al staff to cope with the additional work load.&#13;
(f)  The Government re uested the Immigration authorities to&#13;
simplify the immigration clearance procedures and to issue&#13;
passports pendin  verification of character and antecedents&#13;
of the candidates who were recommended by BNvET as finally&#13;
selected for overseas employment.&#13;
Different Channels of Recrufiment&#13;
1.X4      The channels of recruitment continued to be mainly:&#13;
(a)  BMTET as the sole Government Agency.&#13;
(b) Licenced Recruiting Agents/Passage Brokers.&#13;
(c) Private parties securing ad hoc permission for recruiltment.&#13;
(d) Individual effort, i.e. persons obtaining jobs through relations&#13;
and friends already in the Middle East.&#13;
(e) Foreign rnissions in Bangladesh.&#13;
(f)  Bangladeshi firms securing contr-.cts for work in the Middle East.&#13;
1.25      The recruitment practiceL in the country for processin  the demand&#13;
from foreign employers by the different recruiting media are as follows:&#13;
(a) BL'ET.&#13;
This medium which claims 34% of total requirements, has the following&#13;
recruitment practices:&#13;
(i)    Details of manpower required by the employers showing the&#13;
occupation, vacancies in each occupation, educational&#13;
qualifications and salary offered are communicated to the&#13;
Director C-eneral of BMET directly or through the nearest&#13;
Bangladesh Embassy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  12  -&#13;
(ii)   BMET lines up candidates and informs the employers&#13;
visitin, Bangladesh to conduct interviews and tests,&#13;
arrangements for which are made by BITET. The&#13;
employers bear the travel cost, hotel and other&#13;
expenses.&#13;
(iii)  On selection by the employer a contract approved by&#13;
BMET is recuired to be signed with each selected&#13;
employee stating terms and conditions.&#13;
(iv)   Medical tests and passports for persons signing con-&#13;
tracts are arranged. by BIET at the expense of the&#13;
candidates.&#13;
(v)    On receipt of visa and passage instructions IMET&#13;
obtains a visa from the local embassy of the co-ntry&#13;
concerned and arranges the departure of the selected.&#13;
persons.&#13;
(vi)   The employer is no, required to pay any fee to BIET&#13;
for the services rendered.&#13;
(b)  Private Recruiting Agents/Passage Brokers.&#13;
This medium claims $ of the total recruitment.  The recruitin0&#13;
agents Pre private parties authorised by the Government to re-&#13;
cruit personnel for overseas employment against vacancies cro-&#13;
cured by themselves through their o xn efforts.  The agents are&#13;
not allowed. to process vacancies reported by the employers to&#13;
the Government.  The agents are supposed to make direct con-&#13;
tact and ne,otiate with the employers either by correspondence&#13;
or by personal visit at their o-rn expense in order to procure&#13;
vacancies.  The documentary evidence of offers received by the&#13;
agents are to be produced before the Bangl-desh Mission in the&#13;
country concerned for examination of genuineness as well as&#13;
the terms and conditions of offer, which should be at least&#13;
the minimum of that country.  The attested documents are then&#13;
carried to the Director General of BVET who gives permission&#13;
to the agents to recruit the required personnel from among&#13;
the candidates already registered with the EmploymerLt Exchanges.&#13;
Althou-t this _s the usual practice insisted upon by the G-overn-&#13;
ment quite often the agents recruit unregistered candidates&#13;
without prior permission and call on DuET for clearance after&#13;
completion of the whole process of recruitment.  The agents&#13;
do not officially charge any fee from the candidates but they&#13;
receive a commission from the employers for the services rendered.&#13;
The amount of the commission is negotiated and varies from&#13;
US$70 to over US$100 per candidate.  The agents are requ-red&#13;
to give a lump sum of Tk. 50OOO as a deposit (previously this&#13;
was Tk. 5,000) to the Government as a guarantee for good&#13;
conduct while seeking a reoruitin:' licence.  The security&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  13  -&#13;
depocit is refundable, but may be forfeitted in the case of&#13;
proved mir-iconduct.  Two hu-ndred seventy-one recruiting agents&#13;
are in the field now, most of them in Dacca, Chlittagong and&#13;
Sylhet. Of them, barely 10% have obtained demands more than&#13;
once, while the majority of the other agents have never dealt&#13;
with any genuine demands.  Big employers, as a matter of cour:e,&#13;
have be-dter kaiowledge of the world labour market, and of&#13;
necessity move around the  ,lobe to distant countries in an&#13;
attempt to hire labour.  They draw up their labour recruiting&#13;
policies in a planned way and generally make contacts with&#13;
C-overnments of the labour supplying countries.  Small employ-&#13;
ers who might need a quick supply of labour in limited numbers&#13;
may not have the mean/ to do this.  They generally wait for&#13;
the middlemen to contact them and find it economic to recruit&#13;
persmonnel through these middlemen on payment of a commission&#13;
for the recruiting services. Government-licenced recruiting&#13;
agents were expected to meet the demands of these small&#13;
employers who would otherwise have not recruited from Bangla-&#13;
desh. The bulk of Middle Eastern employment is generated&#13;
from these small employer,, -but Bangladeshi agents have not&#13;
been able to tap this source properly as yet.&#13;
(c)  Private Parties,&#13;
Even private parties without recruiting licences are allowed&#13;
to recruit if they have obtained a genuine demand, in the same&#13;
manner as in bhe ca!:e of an agent.  Ho-,ever, an agent has an&#13;
advantage over a private party inasmuch as the former has had&#13;
a Government licence which serves as identification as well as&#13;
an introduction to the employers.&#13;
(d) Individual Efforts.&#13;
As already discussed, overseas employment commenced through&#13;
indivLdual effort and individual effort still claims over 57%&#13;
of the total recruitment. These offers of employment are&#13;
procured by the job-seekers themselves through their friends&#13;
and relations already in the Middle East. Apparently, the&#13;
people already working in the Middle East collect the passport&#13;
numbers, etc. of the interested persons and somehow convince&#13;
their employero to recruit such persons in absentia.  The&#13;
employers then arrange for the visa instructions to be issued&#13;
to their respective embassies in Bangladesh with a copy sent&#13;
directly to the persons concerned in Ban ladesh, who then&#13;
approach BMET seeking clearance.  Individual efforts are al:o&#13;
made by organised, unlicenced middlemen to secure offers of&#13;
employment on a large scale.  Genuineness of these offers is&#13;
automatically verified in the embassies while  issuin  visas.&#13;
Recruitment offers are sometimes made for groups indicating&#13;
the names of occupations and the number of recruits required,&#13;
keeping open the authority for recruitment. This method of&#13;
recruitment ic, however, very rare these days.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
For the purpose of statistics, individual efforts include&#13;
private parties dealing ,ith vacancies as in (c) above.&#13;
(e) Foreign Missions in Bangladesh.&#13;
Generally the Ambassadors and other officials of the foreign&#13;
missions in Bangladesh send requests to BTIET for the emigra-&#13;
tion of their Bangladeshi domestic servants to their homeland.&#13;
Personal attachment as well as the need of the employers con-&#13;
tribute to recruitment, but this forms a negligible percentage&#13;
of the total emigration.  Recently, ho.Tever, certain embassies&#13;
in Bangladesh have entered into direct recruitment of all&#13;
kinds of manpower on several occasions by advertising the&#13;
vacancies themselves. These activities of the foreign&#13;
embassies -,ere highly irregular, but the Bangladesh Govern-&#13;
ment allowed it under pressure of the circumstances. The&#13;
concerned embassies, however, explained these activiWies as&#13;
arising from their lack of confidence in BMET's abil-ty to&#13;
ensure a fair selection of candidates.&#13;
(f)  Banglade h Firms Abroad.&#13;
There are now; about a, dozen Bangladeshi firms working in dif-&#13;
ferent Middle East countries. Libya has nine Bangladeshi&#13;
firms operating there, Abu Dhabi two and Iraq one; al are&#13;
construction firms.  Only one fiin has a direct contract to&#13;
work in Abu Dh--bi and it has been working there since 1975;&#13;
the others are sub-contractors under foreign firms and they&#13;
have entered into agreements very recently. Four firms out&#13;
of the nine in Libya have formed a consortium to install a&#13;
power house; all the other firms in the three countries are&#13;
engaged in civil construction work.  In all they have so far&#13;
been responsible for the emigration of 3,600 Bangladeshi&#13;
workers.&#13;
Terms of Recruitment&#13;
1.26      With a few exceptions during the initial days, corkers are migrating&#13;
purely on fixed-term contracts.  The salary and other service conditions of&#13;
the migrants are negotiable.  The follo-ing standards, however, form the&#13;
basis for negotiation:&#13;

Each worker is under an obligation to remit 25%o of his salary to&#13;
Bangladesh. This is difficult to enforce since the employer is&#13;
not required to pay any part of the salary directly to Bangla-&#13;
desh.&#13;
(f)  Income tax and other regulations regarding Bangladesh Nationals working&#13;
abroad.&#13;
There is no obligation on the part of the foreign employer to arrange&#13;
for the payment of tzixes due by the Bangladeshi employees for in-&#13;
come earned abroad. The employers' obligation is limited to the&#13;
payment of salaries and ensuring the conditions of work mentioned&#13;
in the contract.&#13;

Characteristics of Migrants&#13;
1 .-27    As per the records of BMET, 58,073 persons have so far migrated to&#13;
different Middle East countries on contract employment  cp to April 1979.  Out&#13;
of these 61% have contracts for one year, 35% for t-w o years, and 4v/o for three&#13;
years or more. Out of the total mirn]ants 72.3% are construction workers, both&#13;
skilled and unskilled, while 8.7% belong to professional and technical occup_-&#13;
tions. In all migrants have 319 different occupations. 83.4% are below&#13;
matriculation level of education, 2.25%  are post-graduaates and 0.35j%  are&#13;
specialists.  The foreian exchange earned until Apr,l 1979 amounted to&#13;
Tk. 3,937.2 million.  The following Table will show the percentage breakdown&#13;
of the total migrants recruited through different media:&#13;

(iii)  Major Administrative Problems&#13;
1.28      BJET is headed by a Director General (D.G.).  2n intervie-wT with the&#13;
D.^. revealed that he has a very high degree of job satisfaction, but i.: extremely&#13;
worried that, although the processing of all foreign employment cases was his&#13;
responsibility, 85% of this remains beyond his control.  For example:&#13;
(a)  BMET needs four times more space than it has to accommodate&#13;
the office.&#13;
(b)  BIET, if recuested, must arrange other locations in -which foreign&#13;
employers can conduct interviews and test candidates; not an easy&#13;
tas:a.&#13;
(c)  BURET hMs no control over passports, immigration clearance and&#13;
relea-e of serving personnel; selected candidate_ have quite&#13;
often been found to have been harrassed unnecessartly on these&#13;
accounts.&#13;
(d)  Flight difficulty of the emigrants is perhaps the worst; direct&#13;
flight connections are not available with most of the ILddle&#13;
East countries, special flight arrangements, landing permission,&#13;
booking, etc. are managed by the Bureau at the employers' re-&#13;
quest.  Even -ithin BUET the D.G. has limited control of his&#13;
own staff; he has responsibility but inadequate power to balance&#13;
it,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  17  -&#13;
1.29      A large number of posts in BMET are vacant.  The nature of functions&#13;
in the Bureau calls for professional skill, but the Bureau has a mixed staffing&#13;
as shown in the following Table which covers only the officer posts in the&#13;
headquarters. This Table was compiled in October 1979.&#13;

1.30      The public relations section of BuET is very weak.  There  s a wide&#13;
communication gap with the public. As a result, people have misconceptions about&#13;
the Bureau's activities. Establishment of the proposed network of District&#13;
Manpower Offices in all district Headquarters with foreign employmen-c promotion&#13;
as one of the functions of these offices would improve the situation. Quality&#13;
of registration of foreign job-seekers at the Employment Exchan_e is very poor&#13;
and the system of reception is faulty. The Employment Exchange at Dacca has as&#13;
many as seven officers, all of -hom occupy a post, but only one Asstt. Manager&#13;
is assigned to do the registration of all foreign job-seekers, including the&#13;
highly qualif-ed professional, the technical hands and the labour.  The dif-&#13;
ferent types of registrants ouCht to be dealt with by different officers in&#13;
separate sections within -the office.&#13;
1.31      The Master Register of forei_n employment seekers maintained by BEET&#13;
is in very bad shape. As a rule, the registration forms of the job-seekers&#13;
should be kept in the Master Re ister in proper order, i.e. tradewise and within&#13;
trade serially. Referral against vacancies should be made according to seniority&#13;
in registration as well as fitnes-s. But the registration records of BIET are not&#13;
in proper order.  People often complain to the Bureau about wrong matchin;: and&#13;
-himsical referral. A disorderly Master Register and lack of matching system&#13;
leads to corruption in the Bureau.&#13;
1.32      Only the section dealing with individual migrants and Recruiting&#13;
Agents has been maintaining a register to record the names of the migrants,&#13;
including certain details.  The registr-tion, however, is incomplete.  The other&#13;
sections do not maintain such a re-ister; instead they maintain departure lists&#13;
of the candidates scattered in hundreds of files.  While collectin . the 1031o&#13;
sample for this study, quite a large number of these files were not available&#13;
and full particulars were lacking in most of the available files.  This state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  18  -&#13;
of affairs bwill lead to serious problems.  The  Research Section of BICT,&#13;
however, maintains the tradewise number of emigrants and prepares a monthly&#13;
progress report, the usual function of the Re earch Section being the collection&#13;
of labour market and employment data.&#13;
1.33      It is an open secret that the Recruiting Agents realize money from the&#13;
job-seekers although such practices are unlawful and punishable. This has been&#13;
occurring because the general public has no clear idea about the procedure of&#13;
dealing with foreign vacancies by the Recruiting Agents. Even some of the&#13;
Agents have no ideas about their own responsibility. The wrong idea is tha-.&#13;
the Agents are given a share of vacancies received in BEET.  The general public&#13;
is often mis-led by this notion and fall prey to unscrupulous Recruiting Agents&#13;
who charge money on the false plea of giving jobs even when they do not have&#13;
vacancies. Unscrupulous passage brokers receive money from the prospective&#13;
mi&amp;,rants in many ways; they of-ten select more candidates than are required for&#13;
the available vacancies and collect money from all of them.&#13;
(iv) Policy Suggestions&#13;
Need for a Master Plan&#13;
1.34      One of the largest manpower exporters is India which does not seem to&#13;
have an abundant supply of skill even though they are exporting manpower.&#13;
Similar countries are Pakistan, Philippines, Turkey, South Korea and Thailand.&#13;
Export of manpo :er is periodically curtailed, e.&gt;. Turkey is no longer exporting&#13;
labour on a large scale.  Turkey is known to have gained by transfer of technology&#13;
on accouns of returned migrants.  The Government of Banglade'h is, hoeever,&#13;
determined to stimulate emigration of Bangladeshi nationals in an ever-increasing.&#13;
number.  This sug ests the need for a MaI-:ter Plan which should include the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)  Revision of the Emigration Act of 1922.&#13;
Bangladesh has inherited an emigration policy as envisaged in the&#13;
Emigration Act of 1922. The provisions of the Act have not been&#13;
updated, and they do not meet the present requirements.  Times&#13;
are different now, and so is the nature of migration. The&#13;
definitions of "skilled work" and "unskilled work" as Jtipulated&#13;
in Article 2 of Chapter 1 of the Act are inadequaue. The inten-&#13;
tion of providin  two separate rules for "Emigration for the pur-&#13;
pose of skilled work" (Article 9, Chapter III) and "Emigration&#13;
for the purpose of unskilled work (Article 15, Chapter IV) is&#13;
not clear. These two rules are not fundamentally different and&#13;
separate rules are not necessary. Articles 16 to 18 of Chapter&#13;
IV dealing with the application for permission and clearance of&#13;
migrants are restrictive in nature and the provision; there-&#13;
under are too stiff. Application of these rules will create&#13;
emigration difficulties instead of simplifying the procedure.&#13;
"Fines" and "'PunizLments"l are minimal, only provided under Articles&#13;
25, :26 and '7 of Chapter VI. The Act is not comprehensive, the&#13;
entire frame of it should be revised and updated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  19  -&#13;
(b)  Manpower Export Authority.&#13;
BMET has some impor-tant functions to perform, i.e. training&#13;
guidance, employment creation and placement. These have been&#13;
overshadowed and the progress of work has been retarded by at&#13;
least fifty percent due to the pressure of manpower export&#13;
functions. The nature of the work involved in processing&#13;
foreign vacancie- is such that any other functions existing&#13;
simultaneously with it will have to suffer. It hat been&#13;
argued that an organisation of manpower export need- a com-&#13;
merci l outlook and the means to easily finance its programmes.&#13;
Setting up of a Manpower Export Authority (Corporation) is,&#13;
therefore, under consideration by the Government. But in view&#13;
of the sad experience of certain other public sector corpora-&#13;
tions, a note of warning may be in order that the proposed&#13;
Manpower Export Authority must be a small office manned at&#13;
supervisory levels by people havin training and experience&#13;
(if possible) in placement work.  Failure to develop a Master&#13;
Register and matchin; system in BMET should not recur in the&#13;
Authority. A similar organisation named Overseas Employment&#13;
Development Board (OEDB) exists in the Philippines. The&#13;
Philippines OECB has embarked on a series of projects aimed&#13;
at enhancing the comparative advantage of the Philippines in&#13;
the export of manpower:&#13;
(i)    Careful selection of Philippine workers; maintenance&#13;
of a pool of pre-selected rorkers (a Master Re-ister).&#13;
(ii)   Expansion of OEDB services. to upgrade the :uality of&#13;
manpower export.&#13;
(iii)  Organisation of work teams for package employment over-&#13;
seas on a Government-to-Government agreement.&#13;
(iv)   Expan .ion of the Regional Recruitment Scheme.&#13;
(c)  Recruiting Agents and Individual Efforts.&#13;
Studies revealed that individual efforts represented over 57%&#13;
of the total recruitment, while all other areas were responsible&#13;
for less than 43% recruitment, including Recruiting Agjents for&#13;
E%. Therefore, any restriction on individual efforts will&#13;
drastically cut the flow of migration. No obstacle should be&#13;
allowed to create difficulties for individual efforts to export&#13;
manpower.&#13;
(d)  Employment Promotion and Institutional Back-up.&#13;
A manpower export policy cannot be taken up in isolation without&#13;
fitting it within the general economic framework of the country,&#13;
so that it may be integrated with the general employment promo-&#13;
tion effort. It is worthwhile to examine a developed country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
The Federal Republic of Germany solved her acute post-war&#13;
unemployment problem with an efficient Employment Promotion&#13;
Act and the machinery and institutional support to implement&#13;
the Act. Based on -,his principle, Germany has a network of&#13;
employment offices both inside and outside the country (the&#13;
employment offices which the Federal Employment Service of&#13;
Germany formerly mailntained in various foreign countries&#13;
have now been provisionally closed, except in Italy). The&#13;
employment office network covers the following major&#13;
functions:&#13;
(±)     Placement.&#13;
(ii)    Vocational guidance.&#13;
(iii)   Promotion of vocational training through formv.l courses&#13;
and apprenticeship training.&#13;
(iv)    Industrial and vocational rehabilitation of "he handi-&#13;
capped.&#13;
(v)     Employment promotion schemes to create and maintain&#13;
employment opportunities.&#13;
(vi)    Labour Market Information.  As provided under the&#13;
German Employment Promotion Act this is the first and&#13;
indi,pensable function of the Employment Office network.&#13;
The provision of information on how the labour market&#13;
is developing, statistical data on employment, unemploy-&#13;
ment vacancies and causes and trends of the labour&#13;
market changes are all required to make decivions -w-hich&#13;
will have economic or structural repercussions.&#13;
(vii)   Overseas employment promotion.  The employment offices&#13;
abroad were responsible for placement of foreign&#13;
applicants in Germany.&#13;
The Bangladesh Government has a similar plan to establish an&#13;
employment office network with an office at each District Head-&#13;
quarters. The plan for a Manpower Export Authority proposed&#13;
the establishment of four regional offices in different Middle&#13;
East countries. Both these plans are under consideration. The&#13;
employment office network, for Bangladesh is being considered&#13;
in India, Japan, Australia, Malaysia, Solomon Islands, New&#13;
Zealand, the Philippines and other countries.&#13;
(e)  Employment Research Institute.&#13;
The Bangladesh Government has recently been thinking of an Employ-&#13;
ment Research Institute. Institutions like the Bangladesh&#13;
Institute of Economic Research, National Foundation for Human&#13;
Resources Development are meant to carry out research in a broader&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  21  -&#13;
spectrum covering human resources, development in general.  Alhat&#13;
is needed is an Institute to carry out research on matters of&#13;
immediate interest.  Action-oriented research programmes will be&#13;
conducted in this  hnstitute to promote the overseas employment&#13;
market for the Bangladeshi workers.  The Government'  ambition&#13;
is to supply ane million workers to Middle East coiuntries during&#13;
the next five years. This will require the Institute to draw&#13;
up action programmes to train a suitable number of people to&#13;
meet the demands of the domestic labour market as well as to&#13;
collect specific overseas demands and meet the same. The&#13;
institute has not yet taken shape, but it appears that a very&#13;
difficult task is being contemplated for it.  To make its&#13;
programme a success the Institute will re.uire baseline&#13;
statistical data, on manpower in relation to all other manpo*,ier&#13;
development and employment promotion programmes of the Govern-&#13;
ment. However, the Institute will require a network of offices&#13;
throughout the country immediately for the supply and flow1 of&#13;
information that it might require.  The proposed District&#13;
Manpower Offices, as indicated earlier, seem to be a solution&#13;
to this problem. The Institute will also have to depend on&#13;
the regional offices of the Manpower Export Authority in the&#13;
Middle East to collect information about the overseas labour&#13;
demand.  Clearly the Institute will largely be dependent on&#13;
these two proposed schemes of (i) District Manpower Offices,&#13;
and (ii) Regional Manpoler Offices in the Middle East. iithout&#13;
these offices an Employment Research Institute wll1 fail to&#13;
meet the desired objectives. The Government and BMET has a&#13;
plan for promotion of self-employment within the country and&#13;
employment abroad for Banglade-hi workers.  The plan might&#13;
need to be involved with the proposed Employment Research&#13;
Institute (ERI). In the long run the ERI may train the&#13;
professional manpo er officers if the Government so desires,&#13;
It is apparent that manpower matters are a burning subject&#13;
which sl,ould receive priority attention as a matter of&#13;
necessity. This calls for the services of an efficient&#13;
team of manpower officers.  A sizeable number of qualified&#13;
social scientists are already working in the manposer field.&#13;
In the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training alone&#13;
there are over 126 manpower officers having gazetted status.&#13;
To raise their efficiency and standard of service it is&#13;
necessary for a cadre of Bangladesh Manpower Services to be&#13;
created and the officers within the cadre to be thoroughly&#13;
trained.  Creation of a cadre will attract be-tter people to&#13;
join the service, which i  very much needed.&#13;
(f) Brain Drain Reversal.&#13;
This is not a new idea, as it has been successfully imple-&#13;
mented by UNDP in Turkey. The plan i, called the Brain Drain&#13;
Reversal Scheme.  The UNDP Resident Representative in Turkey&#13;
reported that "Seldom before in the history of the United&#13;
Nations has so much been accomplished w th so little." The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  22  -&#13;
scheme is aimed at inviting the expatriate Turkish nationals&#13;
back home to give short consultancy services in the required&#13;
fields. The principle was to ask an expatriate Turkish pro-&#13;
fessional who had attained success in his field abroad to&#13;
make a short intensive visit to a Turkish institution where&#13;
his knowledge could be of use. A similar scheme may be drawn&#13;
up and the opportunities may be created for the Bangladeshi&#13;
scientists, technologists and other professionals to repatriate&#13;
and reverse the brain drain.&#13;
(g) Utilization of Remittances.&#13;
Of late, migrants have been urging the Government to find ways&#13;
to better utilize their remittances. A group of Bangladeshi&#13;
engineers and doctors working in Malaysia made this request&#13;
to an officer of BMET. They thought that such a scheme would&#13;
encourage the inward flow of remittances; people who were&#13;
otherwise keeping their overseas earnings in foreign banks&#13;
would send their money back to Bangladesh.&#13;
C. Manpower Training and Supply in Bangladesh&#13;
1.35       It is estimated that the literacy rate is ab6ut 35% and the labour parti-&#13;
cipation ratio is 36%.  The different levels of education are Primary (five years),&#13;
Secondary (five years), Higher Secondary (two years), Degree (two years), and&#13;
Post Graduate (two years).  The country had about 40,313  Primary schools in&#13;
1976. This number has been increasing. During the same year there were 9,299&#13;
Secondary and Higher Secondary schools, 338 Degree Colleges and six Universities.&#13;
Total enrolment in these institutions is approximately 10,036,213.  Every year&#13;
over 100,000 students pass the Secondary level examination, over 49,000 the Higher&#13;
Secondary level examination and over 20,000 Degree and Post Graduate examinations.&#13;
A large number of people enter the labour market from all levels.&#13;
1.36       The technical literacy in Bangladesh is considerable.  The country has&#13;
two technical Universities (Engineering and Agriculture), three Engineering&#13;
Colleges, nine Medical Colleges including a Post Graduate Medical Institute,&#13;
35 Vocational Training Institu-tes, 17 Polytechnic Institutes, and 13 Technical&#13;
Training Centres including one Marine Training Institute. These institutes pro-&#13;
vide all essential professional, technical and skilled trade training courses&#13;
which have current demands. Besides, trade training is given through Apprentice-&#13;
ship Training Programmes of the Government, and still more is given through&#13;
in-plant and on-the-job training in industries. Annual intake capacity of cer-&#13;
tain professional, technical and skilled training institutions are as follows:&#13;

In addition to these training facilities, different Ministries, Departments and&#13;
Corporations have their own training arrangements, detailed information of which&#13;
was not available for this study.&#13;
1.37      A very large number cf new Private Training Institutes have also grown&#13;
in different places within the country. Reliable statistics are not available&#13;
at this moment for all these training organisations. However, according to a&#13;
survey conducted by BIMET in 1977, it was found that over 565 professional, tech-&#13;
nical and vocational training institutes were operating in the country with enrol-&#13;
ment capacities of 102,106 persons and an annual output of over 55,930 trained&#13;
personnel. The survey covered Government, semi-Government and Private institutes.&#13;
The training base has been further increased during the recent years and massive&#13;
training programmes have been undertaken by both the Government and private enter-&#13;
prises. BMdET survey results of 1977 may be seen below:&#13;

1.38      The Government has been paying more and more attention to technical train-&#13;
ing because of three reasons. Firstly, it has been recognised that rural develop-&#13;
ment is the key for economic development in Bangladesh; so a formal sector has&#13;
to be developed in the rural areas by giving extensive trairirg. As such a&#13;
Training and Development Centre has been established in each of the 470 police&#13;
stations throughout the country. Secondly, the econory of the country needs to&#13;
be transformed toward industrialisation very quickly. In 1976 there were 2,560&#13;
factories producing some 304,880 selected industrial items. HNew industries have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  25  -&#13;
been coming up, and attention has been paid to establishing numerous agro-based&#13;
industries in different regions including a Rural Development Academy in Comilla&#13;
which has been generating ideas for model projects. Thirdly, manpower export to&#13;
Middle Eastern and African countries has inspired technical training. The aim&#13;
is to raise a large contingent of professional, technical and skilled personnel&#13;
to meet the requirement within the country and to help these other countries meet&#13;
their labour shortage.&#13;
1.39      Types of manpower available.&#13;
(a)  All types of Engineering Manpower.&#13;
Bangladesh produces 600 graduate engineers annually from facilities&#13;
for post-graduate training leading to a Ph.D. in Engineering. The annual&#13;
production of engineering technicians is in the thousands. These engin-&#13;
eers and technicians are experienced in construction, repair and main-&#13;
tenance of roads and highways, power stations, irrigation systems,&#13;
railways, waterways and ports, telephone systems, industrial installations,&#13;
shipyards and dockyards, radio and television networks, public health&#13;
facilities, etc.&#13;
(b) Medical Manpower.&#13;
Eacilities exist in different medical degree colleges and a post graduate&#13;
medical institute to ensure an annual output of over 1,200 medical graduates&#13;
including dental surgeons and pharmacists. This number may increase in&#13;
1983. Similarly training facilities exist to train radiographers, com-&#13;
pounders, dressers, dental technicians, nurses, midwives, etc.&#13;
(c) Tradesmen.&#13;
Skilled tradesmen having sufficiently high levels of skill are available&#13;
in basic engineering and building trades. These include electricians,&#13;
petrol-diesel mechanics, welders, fitters, machinists, moulders, turners,&#13;
plumbers, carpenters, masons, cabinet makers, draughtsmen, etc.&#13;
(d) Industrial Manpower.&#13;
A large number of industrial establishments produce people in these&#13;
areas: professional, managerial, administrative, technical, skilled,&#13;
semi-skilled and unskilled workers with several years of experience&#13;
in the respective industrial field.&#13;
(e) Road Transport Workers.&#13;
Large numbers of people are available as mechanical engineers, auto-&#13;

D* Profile of Migrants from Bangladesh&#13;
1.41      Information of the profile of migrants has been gathered from the&#13;
administrative records of BMET. The purpose of the study on the profile of&#13;
migrants is (a) to examine the volume and nature of migration from Bangladesh&#13;
and draw a general profile of Bangladeshi migrants, (b) to identify the oc-&#13;
cupations and skills in which migration has taken place, (c) to indicate the&#13;
countries where Bangladeshi workers have migrated and ascertain the volume of&#13;
migration to each country, (d) to compare the occupations according to inten-&#13;
sity of demand in the context of total migration from Bangladesh and within each&#13;
country of migration, (e) to examine the trend of migration from different&#13;
regions of Bangladesh and compare the trend, and (f) to examine the nature of&#13;
demand and the terms of recruitment of Bangladeshi workers for foreign employ-&#13;
ment.&#13;
1.42      For the purpose of the study it was decided that a 10% sample would&#13;
be drawn out of the total number of migrants who left during 1977 and 1978.&#13;
In order to have a broad spectrum and also to have a readily applied sampling&#13;
technique the sample was chosen by taking every tenth migrant worker through-&#13;
out the entire number of migrant workers available from different lists. The&#13;
usual procedure in such a case was to select a random number for a point of&#13;
beginning and then to take every tenth case thereafter throughout the whole&#13;
list. For example, if the random number happened to be 5, the sample would&#13;
consist of numbers 5, 15, 25, etc. The formal method followed to determine&#13;
the first number in a subsequent list was to calculate the following:&#13;
(X + 10) - Y where X is the number of the case last selected on the previous&#13;
list and Y is the number of the last case on that list, the highest number on&#13;
the previous list. Names and other particulars of the migrants proceeding&#13;
through BMET were taken from files which contained lists of migrant workers.&#13;
Samples were drawn from these lists according to the above formula. For the&#13;
part of the Crame which consisted of registers (i.e. register for migrants&#13;
proceeding through passage brokers, recruiting agents and individual efforts)&#13;
in which the persons were serially numbered, the selection of every tenth&#13;
case was virtually automatic. While consulting the placement records in BMET&#13;
the total number of migrants appeared to be 38,534, but the departure lists&#13;
indicated that 35,995 persons actually proceeded on employment. Also, while&#13;
the 10" sample was drawn out of the migrants shown of different BMET lists&#13;
some lists were missing and their information could not be made available in&#13;
this study. Thus the total sample which is under study is as follows:&#13;

1.43      Preparation of index cards was a further step taken in processing the&#13;
study. Twelve columns of information were necessary for each migrant, which&#13;
were recorded on one card for each migrant. Tables were prepared from this in-&#13;
formation with suitable corelations. Efforts were made to collect the fol-&#13;
lowing information for each migrant: (a) occupation, (b) name and address of&#13;
the migrant, (c) father's name, (d) age, (e) marital status, (f) period of&#13;
contract, (g) salary (present and previous), (h) passport number and date of&#13;
issue, (i) education, (j) training, (k) previous experience. The information&#13;
was tabulated and analysed to get the desired results of the study.  The Tables&#13;
are given in the Appendix.&#13;
(i) Skill Distribution of the Migrants&#13;
1.44      The migrants were divided into five major skills.  Percentage distri-&#13;
bution between the skills is as follows:&#13;

In order to facilitate observation of the migrants in more detail, the skills&#13;
of the migrants have been further divided into major types of workers. Their&#13;
percentage distribution is as follows:&#13;

1 .45     In the skill distribution of the migrants it appears tha-t the maximum&#13;
amount of migration was 30.17% for "Skilled construction workers" followed by&#13;
28.08% for "Unskilled labour," 9.15%  for "Skil1ed transport &amp;gqipment operators,"&#13;
and 4.98% for "Skilled service workers." These workers belong to a large number&#13;
of trades of which the follow-ing trades have comparatively greater demand:&#13;
(a) carpenter, (b) mason, (c) block maker, (d) rod binder, (e) painter,&#13;
(f) plumber, (g) pipe fitter, (h) electrician, (i) welder, (j) steel fixer,&#13;
(k) very heavy driver, (1) automobile mechanic, (m) mechanical fitter,&#13;
'n) power house technician (high volo,0e), (o) turbine operator, (p) cable&#13;
jointer, (q) cook, (r) washerman, (s) sweeper, and (t) waiter.&#13;
1.46      Migration of engineers an2 eoctors constitutes an insignificant per-&#13;
centa e.  This does not n-ce_sarily mean that these categories h-yre ro demand,&#13;
but that substantial migration did not take place in these due to the stiff&#13;
procedure of clearing them for cverseas employment.&#13;
(ii) Cccupational Distribution of the Migrants&#13;
1.47      The different occupations of the migrant workers have also been&#13;
classified according to the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO);&#13;
their percentage of distribution is as follows:&#13;

01. Professional, Technical and Related Workers&#13;
1. 48      There are 70 occupations (Appendix Table 2) under this major group of&#13;
migrants including doctors, engineers, nurses, accountants, teachers and archi-&#13;
tect.  The maximum number of migrants in this group (32.23 'F'%) have been claimed&#13;
by Libya (Appendix Table 4).  The other countries d.erranding this group in large&#13;
numbers are Iraq, Saudi Arabia and UAE, each claiming 14%.  Algeria, Nigeria and&#13;
Malaysia claimed only this category of workers although in mall percentage.  The&#13;
main supply of professionals come from Dacca District (35.44%) followed by&#13;
Chittagong (10.18%), Sylhet, F\oakhali and Comilla respectively (Append.ix Tsible 7).&#13;
38.18% of the migrants hold Bachelor's degrees, 20% post graduate degrees,  _9%&#13;
Diplomas and 3.64% are specialists.  All others are below degree level (Appendix&#13;
Table 10). It is interesting that the professional migrants have longer contracts&#13;
as compared to other mi rants (Appendix Table 5).  The compar:ison is as follows:&#13;

1. 50      Migration occurred in 1O d.if'erent minor occupations under this group&#13;
(Appendix Table 2). Major trades in this group are office secretary, accounts&#13;
assistant, storekeeper, typist, time keeper, telephone operator, clerk1 etc.&#13;
Under this category 29.69% of the mi rants are skilled workErs, 65.62%  semi-&#13;
skilled and 4.69% unskilled (Appendix Table 14).  This cateaory has their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
its largest market in UAE which claims 32.8% (Appendix Table 4).  The other&#13;
countries having  .ignificant demand for this category of workers are Oman,&#13;
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and Ku:ait. The maximum supply of this category&#13;
came from Chittagon (32.8%) followed by Dacca, Comilla, Tangail and Noakhali&#13;
districts (Appendix Table 7). The migrants have education levels of Secondary&#13;
(28.57%), Higher Secondary (28.57%) and Degree (28.57%); 14.298% are below&#13;
Secondary level (Appendix Table 10).&#13;
04  Sales Workers&#13;
1. 51     ligrants are in four minor occupations:  traders, salesmen, shop&#13;
assistants and the like (Appendix Table 2).  In this group the workers are&#13;
mostly semi-skilled (69.39%) and unskilled (30.61%), there are no skilled worker&#13;
migrants in this group (Appendix Table 14). This category has the highest de-&#13;
mand in UAE (61.22%) followed by Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait (Appendi;&#13;
Table 4). The maximum supply of this category came from Sylhet (32.865%)&#13;
followed by Chittagong (30.61%) and then Dacca and Noakhali supplied smaller&#13;
numbers (Appendix Table 7).  The education levels of the mi, rants in this cate-&#13;
gory are 71.43% below Secondary level and 28.58% from Secondary to Post Grad-&#13;
uate (Appendix Table 10).&#13;
05. Service Workers&#13;
1. 52     Migration occurred in 37 minor occupations under this major group&#13;
(Appendix Table 2). The major trades under this group are chef, cook, waiter,&#13;
bearer, kitchen boy, room boy, all categories of caterin  staff, housekeeper,&#13;
sweeper, laundry boy, -asherman and housemaid.  In thi. group 59.53% of the&#13;
migrants are skilled workers, 16.39% semi-skilled and 24.08% unskilled (Appendix&#13;
Table 14).  Four countries have major demands for this category of workers&#13;
from Bangladesh: Saudi Arabia (211.24%),Kuwait (21.07%) and UAE and Oman (20.07% each).&#13;
The other countries demanding this category are Iran, Bahrain, laiar, Iraq and&#13;
Libya (Appendix Table 4). The main suppliers of this category were Dacca&#13;
district (29.108%) followed by Chitta ong, Sylhet and Noakhali (Appendix Table 7).&#13;
The education level in this category is 1.58% Graduate and Post Graduate, 5.14%&#13;
Secondary and Higher Secondary, the remaining 93.29% are below Secondary level&#13;
(Appendix Table 10).&#13;
06. Agriculture Workers, Forestry, Fishermen and Hunters&#13;
1.53      Migration took place in six minor occupations under this major group&#13;
of occupations.  The major trades are fishermen, farmers, gardeners and sailors&#13;
(Appendix Table 2).  In this group most of the migrants are semi-skilled (8S.15%),&#13;
6.15% are unskilled and 7.6%o skilled.  The maximum numbers of workers in this&#13;
category has been claimed by K-uwTait (78.46%); all these being fishermen and&#13;
sailors.  Only three other countries have a demand for this category; Libya,&#13;
Oman and UAE need only farmers and gardeners (Appendix Table 4). IThe maximum&#13;
supply of this category came from Chittagong district followed by Noakhali,&#13;
Comilla -nd Sylhet (Appendix Table 7).   All the migrants in this category have&#13;
education levels below Secondary.&#13;

07, 08, 09. Production and Related Workers, Transport E uipment Operators  and&#13;
Labourers&#13;
1. 54     The maximum number of people have migrated in 175 differen. trades&#13;
under this category from Bangl.de,h (Appendix Table 2). The major tr...des in&#13;
this group are all types of construction workers such as masons, carpenters,&#13;
rod binders, plumbers, pipe fitters, house electricians, etc; transport equip-&#13;
ment operators such as all types of vehicle drivers, operators, mechanics, etc.;&#13;
production workers such as aircraft mechanics, workshop mechanics, fitters,&#13;
turners, power plant operator , refrigerator and airconditioning repairers,&#13;
etc. In this major occupational group most of the migrants are skilled workers&#13;
(59.46%) followed by un killed labour (35.-'3%) and a small percentage (5.31%)&#13;
of semi-skilled worker; (Appendix Table 14).  This category of workers have&#13;
migrated in large numbers to all countries except Nigeria, Algeria and Malaysia.&#13;
The highest number of this category have migrated to UAE (38.31%) followed by&#13;
Oman and Saudi Arabia. All the remaining countries claimed almost equal numbers&#13;
each (Appendix Table 4). The bulk of supply of this category came from Chit-&#13;
tagong district (31.92%) followed by Sylhet, Dacca, Nodkhali  nd Comilla&#13;
(Appendix Table 7).  The largest number of migrants (91.45%) in this category&#13;
have education level. below Secondary, while the remaining migrants are between&#13;
Secondary and Degree levels; none has a Master's Degree (Appendix Table 10).&#13;
MEost of the workers (63.36%) have contracts up to one year; 33.42% have two&#13;
year contr.;,cts and only 0.14% have three year contracts (Appendix Table 5).&#13;
(iii) Countries of Migration&#13;
1.55      The workers in the sample migrated to t-elve different countries.&#13;
Among the total number of migrants in each coun,ry, most are construction,&#13;
transport and production workers and unskilled labour; some countries, however,&#13;
preferred certain other categories of workers from Ban:ladesh.&#13;

United Arab Emirates&#13;
1. 56     The Emirate has seven states.  Separate studies have not been made&#13;
for each. All seven states together are the principal clients for Bangladeshi&#13;
workers (Appendix Table 3). The numerical difference of migrants between UAE&#13;
and other countries is considerable. Out of the total number of Bangladeshi&#13;
workers in UAB 85.10% are construction, transport e_uipment and production&#13;
workers followed by service workers (5.20%d) and then professional, technical,&#13;
sales and clerical workers (Appendix Table 4A). The maximum number of Bangla-&#13;
deshi migrants in UAE are from the district of Chittagong (34.83%,) followed by&#13;
Sylhet, Noakhali and Dacca (Appendix Table 6). The migrants in UAE are mostly&#13;
in private employment (89.83%) w,hereas in public employment there are only&#13;
10.17% (Appendix Table 11).  The maximum number of migrants in UAE have one&#13;
year contracts (35.96%1) (Appendix Table 12).  UAE follows Libya in claiming&#13;
the maximum number of professional personnel from Bangladesh, followed by UAE&#13;
(Appendix Table 4).&#13;
Oman&#13;
1. 57     Oman is second largest importer of Bangladeshi manpower after UAE&#13;
(Appendix Table 3). Out of the total Bangladeshi workers in Oman 73.63%o are&#13;
construction, transpoit equipment and production workers followed by service&#13;
workers (13.19%) and then professional, technical, clerical and agriculture&#13;
workers (Appendix Table 4A). Most Bangladeshi migrants in Oman are from Chit-&#13;
tagong district (66.81%), followed by Dacca, Noakhali and  Sylhet (Appendix&#13;
Table 6). Almost all the migrants are in private employment (99.11%) while in&#13;
public employment there are only 0.89% (Appendix Table 11).  Most migrants&#13;
(79.78%) have one year contracts (Appendix Table 12).&#13;
Saudi Arabia&#13;
1. 58     The third largest number of Bangladeshi migrants have been employed in&#13;
Saudi Arabia (Appendix Table 3).  Out of the total Bangladeshi migrants in&#13;
Saudi Arabia 69.26% are construction, transport equipment and production s;orkers&#13;
followed by 14.40o service workers, then professional, technical and clerical&#13;
,Torkers. There is no migr tion to Saudi Arabia from administrative, sales and&#13;
agriculture trades (Appendix Table 4A). 18.480% of the migrants are from the&#13;
district of Dacc1 followed by Sylhet, Noakhali, Chittagong and Comilla (Appendix&#13;
Table 6). Among the workers 85.96% are employed in private organisations&#13;
whereas only 14.03% are in public organisations (Appendix Table 11). In con-&#13;
trast to other Middle East countries Saudi Arabia has been employing the majority&#13;
of the migrants (26.50%o) on two year contracts (Appendix Table 12).  Saudi&#13;
Arabia follows Libya in claiming the m ximum number of professional personnel&#13;
from Bangladesh (Appendix Table 4).&#13;
Kuwiait&#13;
1. 59     Out of the total number of mi rants in Kuwait 45.70%0 are construction,&#13;
transport equipment and production workers.  31. 29%o are fishermen.  Other mi-&#13;
grants in Kuwait are service workers, professional and technical workers,&#13;
clerical workers and sales workers (Appendix Table 4A). Most of the migrants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
are from the district of Sylhet (18.40%) followed by Chittagong, Dacca and&#13;
Noakhali (Appendix Table 6). The maximum number of migrants are in private&#13;
employment (83.75%) and in public employment -there are only 12.88% (Appendix&#13;
Table 11).  Most migrants (32. A1%) have one year contracts (Appendix Table 12).&#13;
Libya&#13;
1. 60     0ut of the total number of Bangladeshi migrants in Libya 55% are&#13;
construc-:ion, transport equipment and production workers.  Libya claimed the&#13;
highest number of professional migrants from Bangladesh:  32.285o of the total&#13;
number of professional migrants from Bangladesh and 50.67% of all Bangladeshi&#13;
miL,rants in Libya. The country employed a consider ible amount of agricultural&#13;
labour from Bangladesh. However, there is no migration to Libya in administra-&#13;
tive, clerical and sales trades (Appendix Table 4A). Most migrants are from&#13;
Dacca district followed by Noakhali, Sylhet, Chittagong and Comilla (Appendix&#13;
Table  6).  Most migrants have two year contracts (17%) (Appendix Table 12).&#13;
Qatar&#13;
1. 61     Out of the total number of Ban-,zladeshi migrants in Qatar 83.89% are&#13;
construction, transport equipment and production workers, followed by sales&#13;
workers, service workers, clerical workers and professional workers (Appendix&#13;
Table 4A).  Most mi,rants in Qatar are from the district of Chittagong, followed&#13;
by Sylhet, Dacca and Noakhali (Appendix Table 6).  Most migrants are employed&#13;
in private organis-tions (69.12%) .yhile in public employment there are only&#13;
30.87% (Appendix Table 11). Most migrants (34.9Y5%) have only one year contracts&#13;
(Appendix Table i2).&#13;
Iraq&#13;
1. 62     Iraq follows Libya in claiming the maximum number of professional&#13;
personnel from Bangladesh (Appendix Table 4).  0ut of the total number of&#13;
Bangladeshi migrants in Iraq most (53-.62) are construction, transport equip-&#13;
ment and production workers followed by 16.095o professional and technical&#13;
workers, and service workers and clerical workers (Appendix Table 4A). There&#13;
is no migration in administrative, sales and agriculture trades. Most migrants&#13;
are from the district of Dacca (?6.82%) followed by Noakhali, Comilla -.nd&#13;
Sylhet (Appendix Table 6). In con-rast to other countries, most of the migrants&#13;
in Iraq are in public employment (7'.795%) while in private employment there are&#13;
only 26.35o (Appendix Table 11).  Again, in contrast to most other countries&#13;
the maximum number of migrants in Ir3q have two year contracts (Appendix Table 12).&#13;
Bahrain&#13;
1. 63     Out of the total number of Bangladeshi migrants in Bahrain 80.14%o are&#13;
construction, transport equipment and production workers follo-wed by service&#13;
workers, professional and technical workers, clerical workers and sales workers&#13;
(Appendix Table 4A). Most migrants are from Chittagong distrIct (27.40%)&#13;
closely follo--ed by Sylhet (20.55%) and then Dacca and Noakhali (Appendix Table 6).&#13;
86.39% of the migrants are in private employment and 13.01% in public employment&#13;
(Appendix Table 11). The majority of the migrants have two year contracts rather&#13;
than one year as in most other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Iran&#13;
1.64      Out of the total number of Bangladeshi migrants in Iran 71 01o% are&#13;
construction, transport equipment and production workers followed by service&#13;
workers (15.2 %) and professional and technical personnel (11.59%) (Appendix&#13;
Table 4A). Iran is one of the several countries claiming a considerable number&#13;
of professional personnel from Bangladesh (Appendix Table 4).  There was no&#13;
migration to Iran in administrative, sales and agriculture trades.  Most migrant&#13;
came from the district of Dacca (41.03%) followed by Noakhali, Comilla, Chit-&#13;
tagong and Sylhet (Appendix Table 6). The maximum number of migrants are in&#13;
private employment (73.72%) while in public employment there are only 26.27%&#13;
(Appendix Table 11). The majority of migrants have two year contracts (22.469%o)&#13;
compared to one year in many countries (Appendix Table 12).&#13;
Malaysia, Nigeria and Algeria&#13;
1.65      These three countries showed a completely different trend in respect&#13;
to manpower export from Bangladesh compared to the Middle Eastern countries.&#13;
The countries together claim only 0.55% of the total migran-s (Appendix Table 3).&#13;
While Nigeria claimed a microscopic number of migrants in production trades,&#13;
the three countries imported only professional and technical manpower from&#13;
Bangladesh (Appendix Table 4A). The mi.rants are from Dacca, Chittagong and&#13;
SYlhet districts (Appendix Table 6). All the migrants are in public employ-&#13;
ment rather than private employmert (Appendix Table 11). The migrants in Ni-&#13;
geria have one year contracts, while those in Algeria have tfo year contracts&#13;
and in M,ralaysia three year contracts (Appendix Table 12).&#13;
(iv) District of Origin of the Migrants&#13;
1-66      Migrants from all the districts of Bangladesh have migra-ed to the&#13;
different countries under study; but the maximum number of migrants came from&#13;
five districts and they migrated to all the countries under study. Percentage&#13;
distribution of the total number of m-igrants from each district are as follows:&#13;

1.6y      The percentage of migrants from each district compared to the- total&#13;
population of the same district is as follows:&#13;
Table 1.13:  PERCEnTAGE OF DISTRICT POPULATION MIGRATED&#13;
Total population of      Percentage of pop-&#13;
District            each district in 1974      ulation migrated&#13;
Chittagong               4.6 million                 0.21&#13;
Dacca                    8.3 million                 0.05&#13;
Sylhet                   5-5 million                 0.06&#13;
Noakhali                 3.4 million                  0.07&#13;
Comilla                  6.2 million                 0.07&#13;
It appears that compared to their population the proportion of manpower&#13;
export in the five districts is insignificant.  Some other observations can&#13;
be noted as follows:&#13;
Chittagong District&#13;
1.68      The migr nts from Chittagong are in all countries except Al eria and&#13;
Malaysia.  Among the overseas Bangladeshi workers there are more from Chittagong~&#13;
than any other single district; 66.81% in Oman, 42.627 in Qatar, 34.83% in UAE&#13;
and 27.40% in Bahrain (Appendix Table K'). The district supplied all categories&#13;
of migrants, construction transport etuipment and production workers being the&#13;
highest number followed by service workers, fishermen, professional personnel&#13;
and clerical workers (Appendix Table 7). Out of the total number of migrants&#13;
from Chittagong 87.38ao are rur_l while the remaining 14.62% are urban. The&#13;
religious affiliations are 96%  Muslim, 3% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist and 0.1% Christian.&#13;
Dacca District&#13;
1.69      The migrants from Dacca district are in all the countries under study.&#13;
Mi rants from Dacca are greatest in number in Nigeria, Malaysia, Algeria, Iran,&#13;
Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Libya (Appendix Table 6). The district  upplied all types&#13;
of migrants except agriculture, forestry, fishermen, but the most plentiful were&#13;
construction, transport ecuipment and production workers, followed by profes-&#13;
sional workers, service workers and clerical workers (Appendix Table 7). Out&#13;
of the total number of migrants from Dacca district 65.54% are urban while the&#13;
remaining workers are rural (Appendix Table 8). Their religious affiliations&#13;
are 88% Muslim, 2% Hindu and 9% Christian.&#13;
Sylhet District&#13;
1.70      The migrants from this district are in all countries except Algeria.&#13;
Most of the migrants in Kuwait are from Sylhet. Although they do not have a&#13;
single majority in any other country, they are present in substantial numbers in&#13;
all the countries (Appendix Table 6). The district supplied migrants in all&#13;
categories of occupations of which the maximum number is in construction, trans-&#13;
port equipment and production workers followed by service workers, sales workers&#13;
and professional workers (Appendix Table 7).  Among the total number of mi_rants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
from Sylhet 89.30% are rural a-nd 10.90% are urban.  Their reli ious aff~liations&#13;
are 97% Mur-}im and % Hindu (Appendix T ble 3).&#13;
Noakhali District&#13;
1. 71     This district ha:. migrants to all the 'w,iuntr es under sudyj exc;ept&#13;
Algeria, Nigeria and. Malaysia.  Among the overseas Bangladeshi- :ingrcsnts from&#13;
Noakhali do not have a single majority in any country; but they are present in&#13;
large numbers in all the countries (Appendix Table 6).  The district supplied&#13;
migrants in al:  I.e occupations with the maximum numbei being in construction,&#13;
tran=port equipment and production trades follo ed by .ervice workers, agri-&#13;
culture workers and professional workers (Appendix Table 7). Aric.:'&gt; -:1 ese migrants&#13;
96.81% are rural -while only 3.19% are urban.  99.60o are Muslim ani 0.4% are&#13;
Hindu (Appendi- Table 8).&#13;
Comilla District&#13;
1. 72     The migrants from this district are in all coun.r es under study&#13;
except Algeria, Nigeria and Malaysia.  The over -.eas migrants from Comilla&#13;
district do not h-ve a single majority in any country, but there are many in&#13;
Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Libya (Appendix Table 6).  The district supplied&#13;
m_grants in all types of occupation:- with maximum numbers in construction,&#13;
transport equipment and production workers follo.'ed by professional workers,&#13;
service workers and clerical workers (Appendix Table 7).  The mi.rants from&#13;
this district are 93.00.%/_ rural and 6.94% urban.  Their religious affiliations&#13;
are 9P0o Mu. lim and 1% Hindu (Appendix Table 8).&#13;
(v)  Supply of Imporlant Categories of ManDsser&#13;
1.73      The five major labour exportin  districts may be further compared in&#13;
respect to supply of importan-  categories of migrants as follo-.-s:&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
1. 74     The above Table shows that compared to the number of migrants from&#13;
individual districts, the lar est proportion of profeN.sional workers came from&#13;
Dacca followed by Comilla, Noakhali, Sylhet and Chittagong.  Construction,&#13;
tr,nsport and production workers came in eqaal]y large proportions from four&#13;
districts except Dacca.  Service workers cme frocr Dacca in larger proportions&#13;
than the other four districts which supplied almost equal proportions each.&#13;
Nolve of the other districts has yet been exporting significant numbers of man-&#13;
power. However, a description of their performances may be seen in the Summary&#13;
of Appendix Table 7.&#13;
Periods of Employment Contracts&#13;
1- 75     The periods of employmen-t contracts vary from one to three years.&#13;
There is no contract for less than one year while a microscopic number (0.1%)&#13;
of the l) grants' contracts have over three years.  The general tendency is az&#13;

1. 76     It has been further observed that while most of the construction,&#13;
transport equipment and production workers have employment contracts for one&#13;
year, most professional personnel Have contracts of two years (Appendix Table 5).&#13;
In this respect different countries have different tendencies. For example&#13;
while most of the countries have a tendency to restrict the contract to one&#13;
year, certain other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Libya, Bahrain, Iraq, and&#13;
Iran, prefer two year contracts irrespective of categories of worker; (Appendix&#13;
Table 12).&#13;
Rural:Urbaz Migrants and Reli ion&#13;
1.77      Most migrants are rura  (77.84%) and 22.16% are urban.  Dac-a is an&#13;
exception with 57.34% coming from urban areas. The summary of Appendix Table 8&#13;
provides more details.&#13;
1. 78     Mostly the migrants are Muslim (95.44%) and they are from  ll the&#13;
districts.  Hindu migrants make up 2.51% of the total and they are mostly from&#13;
Chittagong, Dacc and Sylhet districts. There are 1.9%0 Christian migrants,&#13;
from the district  of Dacca, Chittagon  and Barisal.  There -jere only three&#13;
Buddhist migrants, all of them from Chittagong district.&#13;

below Secondary level of education, 10.23% have a Secondary School certificate&#13;
anc a Higher Second ry Certificate, 4.33% have a -achelor's degree and 2.6%&#13;
a Post Graduate degree (Appendix Table 9).  This indicates thau the people&#13;
having a lower level of education have chosen to go for employment in the Middle&#13;
East countries, but this hypothesis does not apply in respect to the skills of&#13;
the mi rants; i.e. the hi;4her the skill the be-Lter the prospect of employment.&#13;
More inform-tt;ion of this car. be found in -he Summary of Appendix Table 10.&#13;
Age Distribation of Migrants&#13;
1. 80     There is no migrant below the age of 15 years, and only 4.40o are&#13;
above LC years of age.  The remaining 95.5-11  of the migrants are bet-een 15 and&#13;
40 years of a'e.  The majcrity of the migrants (8.61%) are between ages 20 and&#13;
35 years.  The distribution ma3 be seen in Appendix Table 13, and as follows:&#13;

Nature of Employment&#13;
1. 82    WIhile only '1.24% of the total r.umber of migrants hs.ve been employed in&#13;
public organisations in different countries, the majority (88.,760) have been em-&#13;
ployed in private enterprises.  The migrants mostly in public employment are in&#13;
countries like Libya, Iraq, Malaysi-a, Algeria and Nigeria (Appendix Table 11).&#13;
A very important characteristic of public employment in all 'he countries under&#13;
study is that such employment claims more professional personnel than any other&#13;
category.&#13;
(vi) Some Fturther Observations&#13;
yaximum Labour Exporting Ili tricts of Bangladesh and the Importing Countries&#13;
of the Middle East&#13;
1. 83     UAE is the maximun labour importing country and the district of&#13;
Chittagong is the maximum labour exporting area in Baangladesh.  There may be&#13;
several reasons contribu-ing to this phenomenon, of Is,ich the main reason seems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
to be as indicated earlier: that migration to the Miiddle East countries&#13;
started through indiv-dual efforts, and the people who had already re ched there&#13;
helped their friends and relations to get employment in those countries. More&#13;
than thirty years ago, people from Bangladesh, especially from the district of&#13;
Chittagong, started to mi-rate in large numbers to the Middle Ea t countries in&#13;
search of work. Even before that people from Chittagong had trade relations and&#13;
communications with Arabian traders.  Most of these Ban ldeshis have been&#13;
staying in the UAE countries,  ,audi Arabia, Oman and Qatar.  The.r performance&#13;
and persuasion seem to have encour g,ed employers to engage Bangl deshi workers&#13;
in ever increasing numbers. Countries having a concentration of labour from&#13;
certain districts of Bangladesh understandably increase this concentration by&#13;
en agin relative and friend- of the employees.&#13;
1.84      As for Sylhet -nd Noakhali districts, the-r peop'le are born adventurers;&#13;
in the past they took chances to adventure at the first available opportunity.&#13;
Also these districts and Comilla seem to have a considerably  developed rural&#13;
formal sector and a large supply of skilled tradesmen. So, the skills required&#13;
by the employers were eacily available in these districts, which contributed to&#13;
the increasing size of manpower export from these districts.&#13;
1.85      The district of Dacca in reality has fewer migrants -han recorded&#13;
because many migrants, although belonging to another district, re-istered a&#13;
Dacca address in order to get chances for foreign employment more 1uickly. A&#13;
very important point should not escape notice: the maximum number of migrants&#13;
were construction, transport equipment and production workers. But the district&#13;
of Dacca, in spite of having the bes+ training facilities claimed the poorest&#13;
migration of these trades, compared to the other four major districts. This&#13;
suggests that Dacca district may have a limited supply of skilled manpower even&#13;
if this appear  to be a surprising conclusion.  Besides, among the five major&#13;
labour eYporting d-stricts, Dacca has a proportionately smaller number of rural&#13;
mi-rants, a fact -.wThich mi ht be due to the growth of a rur-l form-1 sector in&#13;
Dacca district.&#13;
1 .86     The most important reason certain districts export more labour th n&#13;
others may, hoTever, be that the employers usually restrict their  visits to&#13;
Dacca city, sometimes agreeing to go to Chittagong and once in a while to Sylhet.&#13;
The people in and around these districts are more apt to avail them elves of th-,e&#13;
chance of recruitment.&#13;
1- 87     Another important reason why the far flung districts cannot take&#13;
advantage of recruitment is perhaps the short notice of the arrival of the re-&#13;
cruitment teams.  Sometimes they arrive without sufficient prior notice and&#13;
complete the process of recruitment very quickly, thereby failing to meet with&#13;
the prospective candidates from distant Areas. This reason especially contributes&#13;
io th- small labour export from certain remote districts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Frustration Among the Educated Youths, Tr:ining nd Overseas Market for Bangla-&#13;
deshi Manpower&#13;
1.88      Unemployed educated youths feel frustrated about their chances for&#13;
foreign employment, due to the fact that the foreign employers do not need them.&#13;
The education system in the country at the moment gives most students general&#13;
education rather than technical education.  The trades and skills largely&#13;
wanted for overseas jobs have been enumerated above. Construction trades have&#13;
the maximum demand for overseas employment; but unfortunately sufficient train-&#13;
ing base has not yet -rown in this trade; even the Technical Trainin; Centres&#13;
under BMET do not offer most of them. This suggests the need for training&#13;
facilities to train in trade shortage areas. Some measures seem to be apparent&#13;
in this direction:&#13;
(a)  A census is necessary to enumerate the stock of technical man-&#13;
power in the country and to survey in detail the Technical,&#13;
Vocational and Professional Institutes.&#13;
(b)  A survey of recruitment practices of the different organisa-&#13;
tions within the country needs to be done to assess their need&#13;
for manpower over a period of time.&#13;
(c)  The Labour Attaches of Bangladesh Missions abroad may collect&#13;
the development plans of different countries for information&#13;
about their manpower requirements. This would suggest the&#13;
tr ining planning of Bangl desh, keepinc in view the goal of&#13;
m-,npower export   Most of the construction firms in the M dJl&#13;
EEst have their principals in London. The Labour Attache in&#13;
Lcndon rmay contact these principals and negotiate deals for re-&#13;
cruitment of Bangladeshi manpower in the respective countries.&#13;
Other Labour Attaches may assist him in preparing the list of&#13;
such firms.&#13;
Arabic Language, Madrasah Education and Trades Training&#13;
1. 89      Bangladesh is a Muslim country, and Muslims know how to read the Hioly&#13;
Quran in the Arabic l-,n uage.  Every Muslim household in Bangladesh is an in-&#13;
fcrmal institute for Arabic language learning, and there is a large number of&#13;
formal Madrasahs under a Madrasah Education Board in Bangladesh teachin: the&#13;
Arabic languag-e and Islami-t.  The qualified graduates of these institutes have&#13;
a limited field of employment in these institutes only. Their horizon of employ-&#13;
ment can be widened at once both within the country and in the Middle East&#13;
countries by introducing an element of trades training within Madrasah or&#13;
taking the TMadrasah -;Taduates out to TTCs; their knowledge of the Arabic&#13;
language will place them in the front line of employment in the Middle East.&#13;
This idea should be nourished and circulated through the Mosque Societies of&#13;
Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Role of the Rabetat-el-Alame Islam&#13;
1, 90     A Saudi Arabia based Islamic charity organisation for the Muslim&#13;
world is Rabetat-el-Alame Islam. This organisation believes in all philo-&#13;
sophic and scientific advancements, and it has made significant contributions&#13;
toward international development of Muslim countries.  The organisation ren-&#13;
dered help recently to rehabilitaie the Burmese refugees in Bangladesh and&#13;
established an Islamic Hospital in L typically rural area within Cox's Bazar&#13;
Sub-division. In order to augment manpower export from Bangladesh to the Arab&#13;
countries to meet their requirement, this organisation may establish and or-&#13;
ganise one or more Polytechnic High Madrasah in Bangladesh.  The Government&#13;
of Bangladesh may take up the issue through the Bangladebh Mi-sion in Jeddah&#13;
for agreement of the Rabetat authorities in Riadh.&#13;
E Future Trends&#13;
1. 91     The World Bank ha- provided estim tes of manpower re uirements in&#13;
the Middle East until 1980.  These estimates also indicate an occupational&#13;
breakdown of requirements.  On the basis of these estimatec and by reference to&#13;
past migration trends, so far as they can be determined, the following paragraphs&#13;
indicate possible future migration from Ban l:desh, in total and by occup utional&#13;
categories.&#13;
1. 92     As may be seen from the Tables and a sociated commentary, benchmark&#13;
data is rather spar e and therefore one'K acceptance of future estimates depends&#13;
on which of a number of alternative a sumptions is adf-%ed.  Tables 1.19A,&#13;
1.19B and 1.19C provide different estimates on the basis of the different&#13;
assumptions statecl. The highest estimate is provided by Table 1.19C, but even&#13;
this may understate the magnitude of actual future migration.  This may occur,&#13;
for example (a) if Middle East requirements are greater than those estimated&#13;
by the World Bank study, or (b) if for any reason Bangladesh is in the position&#13;
to provide a greater proportion of the Middle East re uirements -than in the&#13;
past; i.e. if Bangladesh increases its share of the M\iddle East market.  This&#13;
result may be achieved, among other factors, through administrative action in&#13;
Banglade h as indicated in the follo;ing paragraphs.&#13;
(a)  Turnkey Projects in the Middle East.&#13;
The best possible way to increase the flow of migration to the&#13;
Middle East seems to be the involvement of Banglladeshi const_uc-&#13;
tion firms signini contracts to work in the Middle East.  Bangla-&#13;
deshi contractors would be responsible for undertaking construc-&#13;
tion projects to which the required manpower would be supplied from&#13;
Ban jladesh. Already there is thinking in this direction; but&#13;
pr: vale contractors are facing difficulties in providing bank&#13;
guarantees in convertible accounts to their principals for obtaining&#13;
contracts.  These ;-uarantees require the Bangladesh banks to put a&#13;
lien on the contractors' assets and then give guarantees through&#13;
the corresponding foreiP,n banks operating in the country concerned.&#13;
But the main difficulty is that Bangladeshi contractors do not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
seem to have sufficient assets to satisfy the local banks; in&#13;
other words not many big private contractors have enough re-&#13;
sources to obtain turnkey offers in the Middle East.  Therefore&#13;
the Government may augment manpower export through turnkey pro-&#13;
jects by undertaking public ventures in which private parties&#13;
may also be involved so that bank guarantees would be virtually&#13;
automatic through the Bangladesh Bank in order to obtain con-&#13;
tracts. Consortia of private firms may also be considered&#13;
simultaneously for the purpose.&#13;
(b) Training Facilities in Critical Trades.&#13;
Certain trades seem to be iJr greater demand than others, but&#13;
sufficient training facilit-es, do not seem to exist for these&#13;
critical trades. The number of training facilities must be&#13;
increased in these trades.  However, the existing institutional&#13;
training facilities for these trades demand certain education&#13;
standards as a pre-requisite for admission into such courses.&#13;
Due to social reasons educated people consider crtain t.rades&#13;
to be less desirable and do not easily accept them. Therefore,&#13;
the easiest .ay to solve this problem is -to organise an informal&#13;
training programme for the helpers in these trades who exist&#13;
in large numbers.&#13;
(c) Apprenticeship Training.&#13;
Org--nisations most affected by migration are power boards,&#13;
machine tool factories and fertilizer f;ctorie . Personal&#13;
interviews with -heir authorities revealed the fact that the&#13;
required educationally cualified and trained people are already&#13;
available to replace the migrant. workers; but what is not&#13;
a-vRilable is an experienced work force.  This would not be so&#13;
had the authorities been implementing the provisions of the&#13;
Apprenticeship Act of the country. This Act provides that the&#13;
e tablishments employing 50 or more workers would keep 2%&#13;
apprentices in the critical trades already identified.  Strict&#13;
adherence to implementing the provisions of the Apprenticeship&#13;
Act would raise a suitable training reserve in each establish-&#13;
ment which would not have any adverse effect on migration in&#13;
the future.&#13;
(d)  management Gaps and Skill Shorta es.&#13;
In view of the paradoxes in the labour market of Ban6ladesh and&#13;
the stock of manpower, the country does not seem to liave any&#13;
skill shortage, but it is the management gap tha-t is a problem.&#13;
If the management gap could be filled, there would be no skill&#13;
shorta e in the future.  The following ;teps mu.t be taken&#13;
iirn:ediately:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
(i)    Implementation of the Apprenticeship Training Act of 196'&#13;
with strict adherence to its provis:onc.&#13;
(ii)   Organisation of informal training programmes for helpers&#13;
to raise their skills in critical trades.&#13;
(iii)  Improvement in processin- of migrants.&#13;
1.93      In the following Tables attempts are made to indicate the possible&#13;
outflow of migrants from Bangladesh, inflow of returning migrants and an over-&#13;
view of total production of skilled manpower and their requirement abroad over&#13;
the next few years.  The fi,-ares in all these T.ables are only indtcative and&#13;
in no way determinant. The position has been shown in the five T1able.&#13;
(Table 1.17, 1.18, 1.19A, 1 19B and 19.C) below.&#13;

breakdown of past (and possibly future) migration.  The percentages are applied&#13;

CHAPTER II&#13;
AN ANALYSIS OF THIE INFLUENCE OF HOME RENITTANCES BY&#13;
BANGLADESHI WORKERS ABROAD ON THE NATIONAL ECONOMY&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
2.1       The last few years have witnessed a phenomenal increase in the level&#13;
of home remittances by overseas Bangladesh nationals. Based on the official rate&#13;
of exchange j  the inflow of migr nts' remittances during the fiscal year 1978-79&#13;
is estimated to be approximately Tk. 2,430 million j . The recripts from this&#13;
source correspond to about 26% of foreign exchange earnings from export of goods&#13;
(Tk. 9,170 million in financial y-ear 1978-79) from Bangladesh and are higher by&#13;
nearly 180% than the receipts from other invisible sources (Tk. 2,000 million).&#13;
In order of importance, migrants' remittances during financial year 1978-79&#13;
ranked next to receipts from export of jute goods (Tk. 4,150 million) but sur-&#13;
passed export earnings from ra, jute (Tk. 2,160 million) -- the other major&#13;
foreign exchange earner of Bangladesh.&#13;
2.2       These remittances helped the country to finance importation of goods&#13;
of assorted nature, to liberalise the country's import policy and to relax the&#13;
restriction on release of foreign exchan-e for financing foreign travel of&#13;
Bangladesh nationals.  In short, home remitt-nces by the Bangladeshi migrants&#13;
have substantially helped cushion the gap between the country's foreign exchan-e&#13;
payments and receipts.&#13;
2.3       Migrants' remittances, however, have not been an unmixed blessing.&#13;
These remittances are blamed in various quarters as responsible for generating&#13;
inflationary pressure on the economy and creating social tensioni:. Many people&#13;
are also critical about alleged use of the foreign exchange remittances of the&#13;
migrants for importation of luxury goods for ostentatious living of a selected&#13;
few belonging to a higher strata of the society. In the absence of any systematic&#13;
empirical work on the effects of migrants' remittances, people belonging to all&#13;
shades of opinion are prone to dr-w conflicting conclusions on various aspects of&#13;
the migrants' remittances.&#13;
j    The middle official exchange rate on September 12, 1979 was E1 = Tk. 34.71&#13;
and US$1 - Tk. 15.45.&#13;
j    The amount represents remittance through official channels and the value&#13;
of goods imported under the Wage Earners Scheme on payment of costs direct&#13;
to the suppliers out of earnings of the migrants abroad. It does not,&#13;
however, include consumer durables including motor cars imported by the&#13;
incoming migrants under Personal Baggage Rules.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
B. The Wage Earners Scheme&#13;
Origin of Wage Earners Scheme&#13;
2.4       Wage Earner3 Scheme j  was introduced in the middle of 1974 by in-&#13;
corporating it in the Import Policy for the July to December 1974 shipping&#13;
period. Relevant extracts from the Import Policy are reproduced in Appendix 1&#13;
The scheme, which was later to become an important adjunct to the economy, was&#13;
launched during the severe foreign exchange crisis experienced by Bangladesh.&#13;
The economy was still recovering from the destruction caused by the war of&#13;
liberation when it received the further jolt of a country-wide flood of almost&#13;
unprecedented magnitude that deftroyed or damaged crops and vital economic&#13;
infrastructure.  The scene on the international front was also not hvppy for&#13;
Bangladesh or any of the less developed countrie . The oil crisis had reached&#13;
its peak, inflation was ,weeping across the nations and industrial inputs, con-&#13;
struction materials and food grains that Bangladesh vitally needed to recon-&#13;
struct her shambled economy were in short supply.  The efforts expended to cope&#13;
with this situation drained the small foreign exchange reserve built up  during&#13;
the preceding t io years. In this desperate situation the Government decided to&#13;
allow importation of a small number of selected commodities out of the foreign&#13;
exchange earnings of overseas Bangladesh nationals-&#13;
2.5      The scheme relies essentially on the scarcity premium that the imports&#13;
financed from wage earners funds enjoy in Bangladesh.  The goods imported under&#13;
the Wage Earners Scheme produce, in terms of Bangladesh Taka, effective yields&#13;
of foreign exchange at a level hi her than that produced by conversion at of-&#13;
ficial rates. This built-in premium over the official rate constitutes the in-&#13;
centive aimed at inducing the migrants to use official channels to send money&#13;
home.&#13;
2.6      The Wage Earners Scheme, in essence, is not entirely a new phenomenon&#13;
in Bangladesh or erstwhile Pakistan. Realising the importance of providing in-&#13;
centive to attract mi rants' remittances, the Pakistan Government introduced a&#13;
scheme, the Home Remitt nces Bonus Scheme, in 1963 to induce her nationals to&#13;
send money home through official channels. Under Pakistan's scheme, which also&#13;
covered foreign exchange earnings from export of goods, the beneficiary was given&#13;
local currency at the official rate plus transferrable Bonus Vouchers equivalent&#13;
to 30/0 of the foreign exchange remittances of the migrants. The rate of the&#13;
Bonus Vouchers was later raised to 4Xo and again to 45%. A voucher which carried&#13;
with it an entitlement for importation of a variety of goods not normally li-&#13;
censed for fin.:ncing against cash foreign exchan, e, could be sold in the market&#13;
at a premium.  The premium, which normally varied from 150'o to 200% toward the&#13;
end of the sixties, eventually stabilised around 175% by the middle of 1971.&#13;
This premium produced an effective exchange rate of about -20 per E1 compatred to&#13;
the official exchange rate of M 11.43.  The importers generally p. ssed on to the&#13;
consumers the cost of the premium by reflecting it in the lnded cost of goods&#13;
imported under the arrangement.&#13;
j    The scheme owes its name to popular usage; it had not been officially&#13;
christened in the initial announcement even though the later announcements&#13;
began to refer to it as the Wage Earners Scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
2.7       Following liberation of the country, the Home Remittances Bonus Scheme&#13;
was abolished and a unified exchange rate of Bangladesh Taka was established&#13;
at Tk. 18.9677 per -1.  This new official rate of Taka, however, soon became&#13;
incompatible with its real strength represented by the free market rate. The&#13;
rates in the free market drifted down to make the Taka a grossly overvalued&#13;
currency.  The currency racketeers quickly seized on thls opportunity and pro-&#13;
vided an attractive parallel channel for transfer of funds to Bangladesh by&#13;
offering  more than the official exchange rate.  At this stage, a scheme, known&#13;
as Home Remittances Premium Scheme, was introduced on 27 July 1972 to match the&#13;
rate offered in the unofficial market; it was designed to yield a fixed return&#13;
of Tk. 30 per £1 reflecting a premium of nearly Tk. 11 over the official rate of&#13;
exchan;e.  The Government subsidized this premium through the public exchequer&#13;
and the foreign exchange element of these remittances was taken into the country's&#13;
overall external reserve.  Unlike Pakistan's scheme or the Wage Earners Scheme&#13;
later introduced by the Government of Bangladesh, migrants' remittances under&#13;
the Premium Scheme of 1972 were not earmarked for specific purposes such as im-&#13;
portation of selected goods or services. Another feature of the Premium Scheme&#13;
which distinguished it from the other two schemes is that the consumers of im-&#13;
ported goods did not directly have to bear the brunt of the premium over the&#13;
official rate paid to the migrants because under the Premium Scheme the remit-&#13;
tances were not earmarked for importation. It is worth mentioning, however,&#13;
that under the Wage Earners Schqme the Government also partly subsidizes the&#13;
premium by way of a preferrential tariff on importation of capital machinery and&#13;
a few other selected items to offset the additional cost involved in accuiring&#13;
a Wa&gt;e Earners fund.  The overall involvement of the Government on this account&#13;
is, ho-ever, far too negligible to detract from the general observations that&#13;
the consumers by and large are actually at the paying end.&#13;
2.8       The premium paid under the 1972 scheme also proved inadequate  -ith the&#13;
passage of time; by 1974 the free market rate of Pound Sterling in relation to&#13;
Taka escalated to as high as Tk. 60 per £1, widening the gap between the free&#13;
market and official rates. This source of foreign exchange earnings thus almost&#13;
dried up when, as mentioned earlier, the Wage Earner Scheme was introduced as a&#13;
temporary expedient. As it happens, however, it is now firmly embedled in the&#13;
import trade of the country and, by all indications, has reached what could be&#13;
called a point of no re-turn. In fact, the scheme, as would be discussed later,&#13;
ha- largely transcended the scope originally conceived by its authors, -'so en-&#13;
compass not only the financing of imports but also foreign travel of Bangladesh&#13;
nationals and other types of invisible payments which are not normally financed&#13;
from official source,.&#13;
Operation of the Wage Earners Scheme&#13;
'.9       The Wage Earners Scheme was 'aunched with a very modest objective; the&#13;
authors of the scheme conceived of a simple procedure for importation of eligible&#13;
commodities by the mi rants. Actual operation of the scheme, however, needed&#13;
constant revisions, adaptations and even improvisations to meet the specific&#13;
situations that arose from time to time. The essential features of the scheme&#13;
with a narratJve on some important aspects of its operation are given here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
2.10      A Bangladesh national gainfully employed abroad is eligible to use his&#13;
earnings to import goods undler this scheme. Also eligible are those who have&#13;
their origins in Bangladcesh but, for one reason or the other, assumed. foreign&#13;
nationality; Government servants or employees of autonomous bodies working in&#13;
overseas Bangladesh Missions or Bangladesh-based organisations like banks, the&#13;
Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, etc., are not, however, eligible to partici-&#13;
pate in the scheme.&#13;
2.11      A wage earner may use his earnings abroad to d.irectly finance the im-&#13;
portation of certain goods under the scheme or he can send a foreign exchange&#13;
remittance to Bangladesh and sell it directly, or through a nominee, to another&#13;
person for import and other purposes, or he may also open a foreign currency&#13;
account in Bangladesh to deposit the fund pending its disposal or use for im-&#13;
portation on his own account. These days, however, a wage earner rarely imports&#13;
goods on his own account; the importation is done by regular importers while the&#13;
wage earner, unaware of the market conditions and import technique, remains con-&#13;
tent to sell his foreign exchange earnings to these regular importers at the&#13;
market rate - the so called. Wage Earners Rate which is also sometimes referred&#13;
to as the IP Rate. j&#13;
2.12      Subject to production of an Earning Certificate from the concerned&#13;
Bangladesh Mission abroad., a wage earner may import transport vehicles, ma-&#13;
chinery and equipment by making payment directly to the supplier.  When the&#13;
goods reach Bangladesh, the wage earner or his agent approaches an office of&#13;
the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports for an Import Permit.  The documents&#13;
required to obtain an Import Permit include a supplier's invoice and a copy of&#13;
the bill of lading.&#13;
2.13      A wage earner can sell his foreign currency to another person who may&#13;
in turn use it either for immediate importation of goods or deposit it into a&#13;
foreign currency account of which he is either the account holder or a nominee&#13;
of the account holder.  The sales normally take place in Bangladesh, but there&#13;
are some collecting agents who collect money on location from the wage earnerE&#13;
abroad with an arrangement for payment of the Taka proceeds to their bank ac-&#13;
counts in Bangladesh, or, as is quite often the case, to a relation of the&#13;
migrant in Banglad.esh. An operation of this type involving compensatory d.eals&#13;
is, strictly speaking, not legal according to the foreign exchange regulations&#13;
of the country, but it is extremely difficult to adopt enforcement measures to&#13;
counteract it.  This medium is often used by wage earners working in isolated&#13;
areas in the Middle East where adequate banking facilities are not available to&#13;
remit funds quickly.  The collecting agents generally send. these funds to&#13;
Bangladesh under the Wage Earners Scheme.  It is, however, likely that part of&#13;
these collections could also be used for clandestine transfer of funds from&#13;
Bangladesh.&#13;
j    IP stands for Import Permit which is issued by the office of the Chief&#13;
Controller of Imports and Exports in favour of an importer; it is required&#13;
for clearance of goods from the customs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
2.14      Foreign currency accounts may be operated in the following way:&#13;
(a) Foreign currency accounts denominated either in U.S. Dollars or&#13;
Pound Sterling can be maintained by an eligible wage earner with&#13;
banks in Bangladesh authorised to deal in foreign exchange.&#13;
(b)  The account holder may operate the account himself or authorise&#13;
another person in Bangladesh to do so; the latter is known as a&#13;
nominee. In some cases, especially when a migrant does not have&#13;
a reliable or experienced relation the bank itself is entrusted&#13;
with the responsibility of disposal of funds through the daily&#13;
auctions held under the auspices of the Wage Earners Fund Dis-&#13;
posal Committee.&#13;
(o)  Deposits into foreign currency accounts may be made by remit-&#13;
tances from abroad through banking channels or by depositing&#13;
foreign currency notes, travellers cheques, etc. personally&#13;
brought into Bangladesh by the migrants.  Similarlr, foreign&#13;
exchange remittances received by a person in Bangladesh from an&#13;
eligible wage earner may be deposited into a foreign currency&#13;
account by the beneficiary in Bangladesh, but this deposit must&#13;
be made within one month.&#13;
2.15      Funds from foreign currency accounts may be used for the following&#13;
purposes:&#13;
(a)  Remittances can be made to overseas suppliers by telegraphic transfer,&#13;
mail transfer, etc. for import of goods against letters of credit.&#13;
Remittances can also be made for imports without letters of&#13;
credit in cases where the suppliers abroad, on shipment of goods,&#13;
send the underlying shipping documents through his banker to&#13;
to another bank in Bangladesh on a collection basis. j&#13;
(b)  Funds from a foreign currency account can be sold by the ac-&#13;
count holder or his nominee to persons proceeding abroad by&#13;
air. The limit is £100 for travel to India, Pakistan, Nepal,&#13;
Sri Lanka and Burma and £300 for other countries.  This can be&#13;
done once a year in the case of travel to the neighbouring countries&#13;
listed above, while for other countries foreign exchange can be&#13;
drawn for each trip. The banks are required to verify the travel&#13;
documents before releasing foreign exchange.&#13;
(c)  Funds can be used to book passage for travel abroad, converted&#13;
into local currency at the official rate (this is rarely done)&#13;
or transferred to any other foreign currency account maintained&#13;
under the Wage Earners Scheme.&#13;
j    This system of import -hich is also known as import on DP (document against&#13;
payment) basis was banned effective 1 January 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
(d)  The Bangladesh Bank also allows transfer of foreign currency.&#13;
from these accounts for various purposes.  Export claims from&#13;
overseas buyers of Bangladeshi goods can be remitted from a for-&#13;
eign currency account. Students pursuing studies abroad are&#13;
allowed to buy foreign exchange from these accounts to meet their&#13;
requirements. Occasionally, firms and organisations intending&#13;
to set up duty free shops for bonded stores are allowed to buy&#13;
exchange in the VTage Earners :Jarket to meet their requirement of&#13;
foreign exchange to build up initial inventory. Foreign ex-&#13;
change remittances towards down payments for acquisition of ships&#13;
in the private sector under the pay-As-You-Earn Scheme or de-&#13;
ferred payment arrangements are also sometimes allowed. In&#13;
short, -,;henever a person or an entity requires foreign exchange&#13;
to meet a genuine commitment abroad but does not fulfil the&#13;
normal criteria to receive an official allocation, permission&#13;
is somewhat liberally given to meet this requirement under the&#13;
Wage Earners Scheme.&#13;
2.16      An important feature of the Wage Earners Scheme is that funds deposited&#13;
into foreign currency accounts by a migrant can be repatriated back to his&#13;
country of present residence without any restriction. This flexibility is&#13;
intended to earn the confidence of the migrants with regard to convertibility&#13;
of funds held by them in the foreign currency accounts with banks in Bangla-&#13;
desh. Foreign currency acco-unts can be maintained by a migrant as long as he&#13;
remains abroad. However, on return to Bangladesh, he may continue to maintain&#13;
the account only for a period of six months.&#13;
2.17      An account holder or his nominee can take a loan from the bank against&#13;
the security of funds held in his foreign currency account; the maximum amount&#13;
of the loan that can be drawn is the equivalent of the foreign currency amount&#13;
available in the account, calculated at the official rate of exchange.&#13;
C. Remittances of the Migrants&#13;
2.18      In the initial stages there was no elaborate system of recording the&#13;
inflow of funds from the migrants in the shape of foreign currency and goods.&#13;
Even though separate records were kept on remittances received through banking&#13;
and postal channels, licensing offices did not maintain separate records on the&#13;
value of imports paid directly to the suppliers abroad out of funds collected&#13;
from the migrants under the so-called direct shipment method which, until&#13;
September 1979 represented another important method of transfer of migrants'&#13;
savings under the Wage Earners Scheme. I/&#13;
j   The system of imports financed against payments from abroad (without involving&#13;
remittance of foreign exchange from Bangladesh) was abolished in September&#13;
1979. The principal reasons for abolition of this system are that it con-&#13;
flicts with the existing exchange control regulations of the country and pro-&#13;
vides an excuse for the currency racketeers to accumulate funds abroad osten-&#13;
sibly to finance such imports, part of which can be used to finance smuggling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
From August 1978 the licensing offices started keeping records of goods im-&#13;
ported under the direct shipment method; the value of these goods plus the in-&#13;
ward remittances received from the migrants through official channels represent&#13;
the net inflow of funds from the migrants under the Wage Earners Scheme. Analy-&#13;
sis of the records of imports under the Wage Earners Scheme during the period&#13;
from August 1978 to June 1979 shows that in terms of value 28.59% of the goods&#13;
were imported through direct shipment while the remaining 71.41% was financed&#13;
through remittances from Bangladesh out of foreign currency accounts. Using&#13;
this percentage, an estimate could be made of the value of goods imported prior&#13;
to August 1978 under the system of direct shipment. The following Table is&#13;
designed to show the net inflow of migrants' remittances in the form of goods&#13;
and foreign currencies since September 1974. 1/&#13;

Total     5,157.80        1,377.36        6,536.16&#13;
*The figures relating to the period prior to August 1978 are estimates.&#13;
The estimate is based on the observed ratio (71.41 : 28.59) between the&#13;
value of goods financed by remittance from Bangladesh and the value of&#13;
goods imported under the direct shipment method during August 1978 to&#13;
September 1979.&#13;
at international levels and to assist illegal transfer of funds from the&#13;
country. The system also causes loss of Government revenue because of the&#13;
anonymity that generally characterises the source of finance, the supplier&#13;
and the consignee of the goods imported under this system.&#13;
1/   Although the Wage Earners Scheme was announced in July 1974 the scheme did&#13;
not actually take off until September 1974 when detailed procedures were&#13;
announced by the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports and the Bangladesh&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
2.19      Appendix Table 17 shows the monthwise breakdown of foreign exchange&#13;
remittances through banks and post offices.  Appendix Table 18 shows the value&#13;
of imports into Bangladesh under the Wage Earners Scheme since 1976. Appendix&#13;
Table 19 provides an overall view of the flow of funds from the migrants through&#13;
various channels from August 1978 to Septem73er 1979.&#13;
2.20      Table 2.1 shows that remittances through banks and post offices during§&#13;
the first half of 1979 averaged Tk. 221.18 million per month. Following the&#13;
embargo on direct shipment of most wage earners goods announced by the Government&#13;
in August 1979, the level of remittances through official channels is expected&#13;
to increase corresponding to the value of goods that were previously being used&#13;
for financing direct shipments.  This, coupled with additional remittances from&#13;
the new migrants who would be going to work abroad in the coming months, is&#13;
likely to cause an increase in the level of home remittances by at least 32%&#13;
during the remaining period of the 1979 calendar  year.  On this basis, total&#13;
receipts d.uring the current year could be projected to be around Tk. 3,000 million.&#13;
Compared. to receipts in 1975, the first fall year of the operation of the Wage&#13;
Ea'ners Scheme, the projected level of remittances (net inflow) during the year&#13;
1979 would be nearly 13 times higher -  the annual growth rate being 94% in&#13;
1976, 245% in 1977, 34% in 1978 and 42% (estimated) in 1979, producing an&#13;
average annual growth of about 100%.&#13;
2.21      The future level of remittances will depend largely on the net ad-&#13;
d.ition to the existing Bangladeshi work force in foreign countries, especially&#13;
Middle Eastern and North African regions.  The latter in turn will be mainly&#13;
influenced by the demand for d.ifferent categories of manpower from outside by&#13;
countries in those regions.  The following Table shows the estimated demand for&#13;
manpower from outside in the major labour receiving countries in the Middle&#13;
East (Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE).&#13;

2.22      The level of remittances in Bangladesh may record a higher growth rate&#13;
because of a possible increase in the level of earnings of the existing migrants&#13;
after they acquire more skill and experience and a higher level of savings after&#13;
the migrants, most of whom have gone to the Mid,dle East in the recent past,&#13;
settle down in their new places of work. Some increase will also occur when&#13;
these migrants start returning to the country with their accumulated savings&#13;
on expiry of contract period. The future level of remittances will also be&#13;
influenced by the Government policies with regard to use of remittance money,&#13;
taxation, investment facilities, etc. No less important is how the migrants&#13;
would assess the economic and political outlook of the country. Removal of ex-&#13;
change control by the British Government will also have a favourable impact on&#13;
the flow of funds from that country.&#13;
2.23      It is extremely difficult to make even an intelligent guess as to what&#13;
the level of migrants' remittances in coming years would be, but it is likely&#13;
that the volume of remittances will continue to reach higher levels at least&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
until 1985.  Based, however, on the projectedc demand for manpo-Ter in the Middle&#13;
Eastern and. North African countries, and assuming a more or less steady flow&#13;
of manpower from Bangladesh to those regions at the current rate, past trends&#13;
of the migrants' remittances and other factors mentioned above, it would be&#13;
realistic to expect an increase in the level of remittance by 25% in 1980 and&#13;
20% in 1981; from 1982 onwards the gro:bth rate is expected to stabilize around&#13;
15% per annum. On this assumption the following Table is an attempt to show&#13;
what the level of remittances during the next six years would. look like.&#13;

2.24      Appendix Table 20 show;-:i the country of origin of funds received under&#13;
the Wage Earners Scheme during the period from 1977 to September 1979. j  The&#13;
inflow of migrantst remittances from various regions show that Bangladeshi&#13;
workers in the U.K., traditionally the major source of foreign exchange earnings&#13;
from remittances, now contribute less than the new migrants in the Middle East.&#13;
The changing regional pattern of remittances is shown in the following Table:&#13;

j    The Table does not bring out the entire position of migrants' remittances&#13;
because it does not reflect foreign currency instruments like travellers&#13;
cheques,  currency notes and drafts brought in person by migrants while&#13;
coming to Bangladesh on vacationsletc. It also preserts a somewhat dis-&#13;
torted picture in the sense that many Bangladeshi workers in the Middle&#13;
East route remittances through third countries, notably the U.K., which&#13;
cannot be readily identifie( yrith reference to the court-ry of origin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
2.25      A comparison of the present level with the pre-liberation level of&#13;
remittances in Bangladesh shows some in-Gteresting results. During the period&#13;
prior to the liberation of the country in 1971, foreign exchange remittances&#13;
from overseas Bangladesh nationals, mostly people from Sylhet settled in the&#13;
U.K., were merely a trickle when compared to the present level of remittances.&#13;
The following Table brings out the level of remittances per month under the&#13;
Pakistan Home Remittances Bonus Scheme, Bangladesh's initial scheme (the Home&#13;
Remittances Premium Scheme) and finally the existing Wage Earners Scheme.&#13;

+Based on an average exchange rate of £1 = Tk. 30.&#13;
It can be seen that folloring the introduction of the Home Remittance Premium&#13;
Scheme in 1972 the volume of remittances sharply increased to produce an average&#13;
monthly receipt of £0.63 million during the first year of operation of the&#13;
scheme. However, as pointed out earlier, the widening gap between the official&#13;
exchange rate and the free market (or unofficial) exchange rate caused sub-&#13;
stantial diversion of migrantst remittances to unofficial channels chiefly to&#13;
finance smuggling of consumer goods. As a result, the flow of remittances from&#13;
the migrants in the second and third years declined to less than £0.4 million a&#13;
month - a level lower than even the 1969-1970 level of £043 million.&#13;
Foreign Currency Accounts&#13;
2.26      Considering the importance of foreign currency accounts in the context&#13;
of operation of the Wage Earners Scheme, a special survey of these foreign cur-&#13;
rency accounts was undertaken. The survey covered 720 sample accounts drawn&#13;
from an overall frame of 42,000 accounts opened by the banks at Dacca, Chittagong&#13;
and Sylhet up to December 1978. The technique involved selection of a random&#13;
number from a table of random numbers for a starting point.  Irom that point,&#13;
which happened to be number 48, every 58th account was selected for preparation&#13;
of cards; the survey, in effect, covered less than 2% of all the accounts.&#13;
The highlights of the survey are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
(a) Geograpnlical distribution.&#13;
The Table below shows the geographical distribution of the foreign&#13;
currency accounts opened by the migrants with oommeroial banks in&#13;
Bangladesh by the end of 1978.&#13;
Number of Accounts Percentage&#13;
Dacca              29,654            70.56&#13;
Chittagong          7,706            18.34&#13;
Sylhet              4,503            10.71&#13;
huIulra                164            0.39&#13;
Total              42,027           100.00&#13;
The accounts are hea.vily concentrated in Dacca because the ra3-ket&#13;
for sale of funds froD the accounts is fairly organised in this&#13;
centre, the facilit.r for opending such accounts with corrmercial&#13;
banks in most other certres 4s non-existent and the migrants can&#13;
conveniently open accounts before they fly from Dacca on comple-&#13;
tion of travel formalities.&#13;
(b) Time distribution of sample accounts.&#13;
The Table below shows the distribution of sample accounts with&#13;
reference to the years they were opened.&#13;
Number of Sample Accounts   Percentage&#13;
1976               39                    5&#13;
1977              250                   35&#13;
1978              431                   60&#13;
Total             720                  100&#13;
The sudden spurt in the number of accounts from 1977 onwards&#13;
is partly on account of the steps taken by the Bureau of Manpower,&#13;
Employment and Training to require the prospective migrants to&#13;
open such accounts before they leave for jobs abroad and partly&#13;
due to the campaigns launched by the commercial banks, especially&#13;
Sonali Bank, to popularize these accounts among Bangladeshi mi-&#13;
grants in the Middle East. The two man delegation headed by Sonali&#13;
Bank's Managing Director which visite3 -lie countries in the Middle&#13;
East and Gulf areas in early 1977 made special efforts to attract&#13;
the migrants into the banking system by distributing account open-&#13;
ine forms among the Bangladeshi workers in those countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
(c)  Currencywise distribution.&#13;
The following is the breakdown of the accounts on the basis of&#13;
the currencies in which they are denominated:&#13;
Number of Accounts Percentage&#13;
U.S. Dollars           32,593              78&#13;
Pound Sterling          9,434              22&#13;
Total                  49, 0)'-           100&#13;
The preponderance of the dollar denominated accounts is ex-&#13;
plained by the fact that until the removal of exchange control&#13;
by the British Government towards the end of 1979, U.K. resiclents,&#13;
including Bangladesh nationals who had been working in that&#13;
country, were not allowed to maintain accounts overseas, including&#13;
Bangladesh.&#13;
(cd) Skill-ise distribution.&#13;
The following Table is a breakdown of the sample account holders&#13;
by their skills:&#13;
Number of Sample&#13;
Account Holders   Percentage&#13;
Professionals                   86              12&#13;
Technicians                    457              63&#13;
Skilled Labourers              105              15&#13;
Semi-skilled Labourers          24               3&#13;
Unskilled Labouarers            4.               7&#13;
Total                          720             100&#13;
In comparison to the technical and professional personnel, the&#13;
share of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labourers works out&#13;
to only 25% of the total number of accounts even though they&#13;
represent more than 70% of the Bangladeshi work force abroad.&#13;
(e)  Countrywise distribution.&#13;
Appendix Table 23 shows the distribution of the account holders&#13;
by the country of their present residence.  As can be seen from&#13;
the Table, Saudi Arabia accounts for the largest number of the&#13;
sample account holders followed by UAE, Libya and Iraq. One&#13;
important feature that emerges from a study of the Table is&#13;
that Bangladeshi migrants in UAE account for about 32% of the&#13;
Bangladeshi migrants in the Middle Eastern and North African re-&#13;
gions but their share is only 12% of the foreign currency accounts&#13;
maintained by all the migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
(f) Districtwise distribution.&#13;
Appendix Table 25 sho:s that the migrants from Dacca district&#13;
maintain the highest number of accounts (35%), followed by&#13;
Sylhet (24%), Chittagong (14%) and Noakhali (13%).&#13;
(g)  means of transfer.&#13;
The tabulation below shows the means used by the migrants to&#13;
send money to the foreign currency accounts in Bangladesh:&#13;
Niumber of Transactions Percentage&#13;
Bank Draft                     1,027                70&#13;

Sale of Remittances: Methods and Channels&#13;
2.27      Migrants do not normally undertake import of goods on their own account.&#13;
They, or their nominees in Bangladesh, sell the foreign exchange remittances in&#13;
the market. The market mainly consists of nominees of wage earners and importers,&#13;
the former as sellers and the latter as buyers.  Professional middlemen also&#13;
serve as an important link bes-ween them in settling the deals. There is no&#13;
regular venue for sale and purchase of currencies; the bank premises provide a&#13;
natural meeting ground for the buyers and sellers. Sonali Bank premises have&#13;
in fact developed inito a sort of marketplace that resembles those of medieval&#13;
bourse or foreign exchange markets in Vienna, Paris, etc. Here one can hear&#13;
the kind of commotion that emanates from the floor of a stock exchange.  A pro-&#13;
spective buyer or seller st eppir- into the bank premises woul-d be confronted by&#13;
a number of people, mostly brokers, waiting to strike a deal with him.  The&#13;
bargains that ensue make it look like a true marketplace.&#13;
2.28      The common instruments offered for sale are drafts, travellers cheques&#13;
and foreign currency notes sent or brought into Bangladesh by the migrants.&#13;
The buyers deposit these instruments with their bankers who collect ';he proceeds&#13;
from drawee banks and credit the relevant foreign currency accounts of the&#13;
buyers. Not infrequently, the banks themselves purchase the instruments on&#13;
their own account and immediately pay the resultant proceeds to the customers'&#13;
accounts; a small commission is charged by the banks for this service. Another&#13;
important medium of transaction is transfer of funds to a buyer from the foreign&#13;
currency account of the seller.&#13;
2.29      A committee was set up in 1977 to arrange disposal of funds through auc-&#13;
tions. The committee consists of representatives of some commercial banks with&#13;
Sonali Bank acting as Secretary of the committee. The objective behind formation&#13;
of this committee was to help dispose of funds of those migrants who do not&#13;
have reliable or experienced relations in Bangladesh to help them. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
committee meets at Sonali Bank in the morning hours every working day except&#13;
Friday to conduct an auction of funds received by the banks the previous day.&#13;
The funds sold in the auction mainly consist of remittances sent by the migrants&#13;
without instructions as to how these should be sold in the market, and foreign&#13;
exchange remittances received from the migrants through postal channels. The&#13;
funds sold through this committee account for about 15% of the aggregate remit-&#13;
tances received in Bangladesh from the wage earners.&#13;
2.30      An important feature of the Wage Earners Scheme, which distinguishes&#13;
it from most other kinds of incentive schemes is that foreign exchange remit-&#13;
tances are not absorbed in the common foreign exchange pool of the country.&#13;
The counterpart foreign exchange represented by balances in foreign currency&#13;
accounts are kept by the banks in Bangladesh with their correspondent banks&#13;
abroad in separate accounts outside their normal exchange position. It means&#13;
that the country's regular foreign exchange reserve is not affected by invward&#13;
or outward remittances under the scheme. Thus, unlike foreign exchange receipts&#13;
from regular exports and other kinds of invisible 'Zransactions, remittances&#13;
coming into foreign currency accounts do not lend themselves to the creation of&#13;
additional local currency by the central bank or the commercial banks. For&#13;
this reason, foreign exchange remittances sent by overseas Bangladesh nationals&#13;
cannot be said to be directly responsible for exerting any inflationery pressure&#13;
on the economy.&#13;
2.31      The exchange rates in the 'Yage Earners MIarket are determined principally&#13;
oy bilateral negotiations between the buyers and the sellers. In the auctions&#13;
conducted by the Wage Earners Funds Disposal Committee, the sales are made to&#13;
the highest bidders.  Appendix Table 22 shows the indicative exchange rates in&#13;
the Wage Earners Market at the end of each month since January 1977; the of-&#13;
ficial exchange rate of Pound Sterling is also indicated along with the element&#13;
of premium over the official rates involved in these sales. On the average, the&#13;
premium is around 3C% for both U.S. Dollars and Pound Sterling.&#13;
D. Migrants' Characteristics and Problems&#13;
Profile of Migrants&#13;
2.32      Except for the records on emigrants maintained in the Bureau of Man-&#13;
power, Employment and Trainin- since 1976, very little is known about the pro-&#13;
files of the migrants and their problems, aspirations, and working environment.&#13;
Nor do we know the precise nature of the difficulties the migrants face to&#13;
send their money home, to find an outlet for investment of their savings, what&#13;
they want to do on return to Bangladesh and how they use their savings.  To&#13;
study these aspects, an ideal arrangement would have been to interview a&#13;
reasonable number of migrants in various countries selected in accordance vwith&#13;
an appropriate sampling technique. However, visits to the Middle East could&#13;
not be undertaken due to fund constraints. Efforts were, therefore, made to&#13;
interview the migrants returning to Bangladesh on vacation or otherwise.&#13;
Obviously, this is not a scientific method of survey, but the results, particularly&#13;
relating to their remittances, savings, etc., will provide an opportunity to have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
a close look at the migrants. Appendix Tables 26 through 42 contain results of&#13;
the survey of 189 returning migrants contacted by the investigators, mainly on&#13;
the premises of the commercial banks which the migrants visited to deposit or&#13;
withdraw money from foreign currency accounts.  The important features of the&#13;
results of the sample survey are discussed in the followin- paragraphs.&#13;
(a)  Age group.&#13;
Most of the migrants from Bangladesh working in the Middle East&#13;
are 26 to 40 years of age (78%). The share of the younger people&#13;
is relatively small, accounting for only 5%o of the migrants.&#13;
(Appendix Table 28.)&#13;
(b)  Number of dependents.&#13;
The survey confirmed the general belief that most of the Bangladeshi&#13;
migrants in the Middle East live there -ithout a family. Of the&#13;
189 respondents, 145 (77%) were living in the Middle East without&#13;
a family, another 44 had four or fewer dependents, and only 7&#13;
migrants had more than four dependents. By contra:st, 177 respon-&#13;
dents representing 94%o of the migrants had their dependents living&#13;
in Bangladesh - 66% of them had dependents numbering four or more.&#13;
(Appendix Table 29.)&#13;
(c) Level of education.&#13;
Forty-nine of the 189 migrants interviewed held professional degrees&#13;
in medicine, engsineering, etc., another 90 persons either held&#13;
a professional diploma or had undergone formal training in a voca-&#13;
tional institute; together they comprised 74% of the migrants inter-&#13;
viewed. (Appendix Table 30.)&#13;
(d) Length of stay in the Middle East.&#13;
The vast majority of the respondents, representing 80% of the total,&#13;
lived in the Middle East for a relatively short period - one to&#13;
two years. Only 208% stayed for more than two years. (Appendix&#13;
Table 33.)&#13;
(e) Level of earnings.&#13;
A clear pattern emerges from comparison of the level of income of&#13;
the migrants before and after emigration. The overseas job brought&#13;
J'orth a phenomenal increase in the level of earnings of the migrants;&#13;
the level of earnings of each occupational group of the migrants&#13;
increased more than ten times compared to their earnings in Bangla-&#13;
desh before emigration. Of the 189 migrants interviewed, 63 persons&#13;
representing 33% of the total had been earning above Tk. 20,000 each&#13;
per month; only 7 persons had been earning less than the equivalent&#13;
of Tk. 5,000.  Profess,ionals and technicians are the highest paid&#13;
group in the Miiddle East while the unskilled labourers are the&#13;
lo-;est paid group.  (Appendix Tables 31 to 34.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
(f) Expenditure and savings.&#13;
Expenditure patterns of the migrants reveal that most of them lead&#13;
a simple life. 66% of the migrants spent less than the equivalent&#13;
of Tk. 5,000 per month.  50 persons interviewed representing 26%&#13;
of the total could maintain themselves abroad with the equivalent&#13;
of only Tk. 2,000 or less. This means that the migrants have a&#13;
strong propensity to save money. Sixty-one of the migrants could&#13;
save more than Tk. 10,000 per month each. (Appendix Tables 35&#13;
and 36.)&#13;
(g) Method of remittances.&#13;
Bank drafts are by far the most common medium to transfer money&#13;
to Bangladesh. 5C%o of the migrants used only this medium to trans-&#13;
fer funds, followed by mail transfer (13%). Only 2% of the mi-&#13;
grants sent their funds through telegrraphic transfers.  34% of the&#13;
migrants used a composite of these means to send money. (Appendix&#13;
Table 37.)&#13;
(h) Time taken to send money.&#13;
The survey revealed that considerable delay takes place in sending&#13;
funds to Bangladesh. Remittance through drafts, the most common&#13;
medium, takes 37 days on the average, while a mail transfer takes&#13;
a period of 7 seeks. 2% of the migrants who used telegraphic&#13;
transfers did not have a better experience; sometimes it took 37&#13;
days for their remittances to reach beneficiaries in Bangladesh.&#13;
(Appendix Table 38.)&#13;
(i) Source of employment.&#13;
54% of the respondents secured their jobs through the Bureau of Man-&#13;
power, Employment and Training; relations abroad arranged employment&#13;
for 12%; recruiting agents were responsible for 11%; 11% of the&#13;
migrants secured their jobs through their own efforts. (Appendix&#13;
Table 39.)&#13;
(j) Investment.&#13;
The survey lends credence to the popular belief that migrants'&#13;
funds are mostly used to purchase land and building. Of Tk. 1.56&#13;
million invested by the migrants interviewed, 54% of the amount&#13;
had been invested in land and building, 35% of the money was kept&#13;
in deposits with banks. Investment in industrial activities claimed&#13;
only 5% of the amount; 5%o was expended on business.  Investment&#13;
in agriculture, the vital sector of our economy, had only 1% of&#13;
their investment. (Appendix Table 40.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
(k)  Expected period. of stay abroad.&#13;
A good number of migrants working in the Middle Eastern region,&#13;
expecially Iran, would like to return to Bangladesh within a&#13;
period of one year. They represent 37% of the migrants interviewed.&#13;
Most other migrants would like to return to Bangladesh within 2 to&#13;
5 years; only 7% of the migrants expressed their desire to stay&#13;
abroad for more than 5 years.  (Appendix Table 41.)&#13;
(1) Future plans on return to Bangladesh&#13;
43% of the migrants would like to go back to their old pro-&#13;
fessions. A surprising number of 52 (391%) wanted to introduce&#13;
private bus service. (Appendix Table 42.)&#13;
Remittance Problems and Possible Remedial Measures&#13;
2.33      The Middle Eastern region continues to present what looks like a&#13;
nagging problem for remittance of money by Bangladeshi migrants working in that&#13;
area. The problem is accentuated by inadequate and often faulty arrangements&#13;
in Bangladesh for disbursement of funds by the banks and post office. The&#13;
efforts to increase the level of remittances from the migrants may, therefore,&#13;
necessarily begin with the introduction of suitable physical facilities for&#13;
quick transfer of funds. Otherwise, illegal currency operators will continue&#13;
to siphon a;way from the official stream a big chunk of remittable funds.&#13;
2.34      Delay in receiving the remittances by the dependents in Bangladesh&#13;
constitutes one of the most irksome problems the migrants face in the Middle&#13;
East. A study of the foreign currency accounts reveals that on the average a&#13;
period of 16 days intervenes between the date a bank draft is issued by a bank&#13;
abroad and the date it is credited to a foreign currency account (Appendix&#13;
Table 25). Another two weeks or so elapse before the dependent, especially if&#13;
he lives in a remote area, receives the money after disposal of the funds in the&#13;
market. Our survey results showed that a remittance on the average reaches the&#13;
bank in about 37 days time.   The causes for this inordinate delay are many.&#13;
In the following paragraphs an attempt will be made to identify them and to&#13;
suggest remedial measures.&#13;
2.35      Inadequate knowledge of remittance procedure.  A large number of&#13;
migrants from Bangladesh consist of people who are not  rell acquainted with the&#13;
remittance procedure.  Educated migrants, as well, are unaware of the technical-&#13;
ities involved in sending money. Many of the 189 migrants interviewed were not&#13;
even aware of the services the banks could render for disposal of their funds&#13;
through auctions. Again, many migrants send money by means of bank drafts or&#13;
similar instruments drawn on and payable by banks in third countries, notably&#13;
in the U.K. or U.S.A., rather than domiciling these instruments for payment&#13;
by banks in Bangladesh.  Encashment of drafts drawn on banks in third countries&#13;
presents special problems, because the banks in Bangladesh send these drafts&#13;
abroad for collection of proceeds through their own overseas branches or cor-&#13;
respondents; the customers are paid only when the proceeds are collected.&#13;
The time involved for collection could be fairly long -- usually more than a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
month. A migrant would use such a draft because firstly, he does not know the&#13;
relative advantages of different kinds of instruments, and secondly he usually&#13;
goes to a bank near his place of work which may not have a correspondent bank&#13;
in Bangladesh on whom a draft could be issued.  The initial efforts at en-&#13;
couraging remittances should, therefore, concentrate on a publicity campaign&#13;
among the Bangladeshi communities to educate them on correct remittance pro-&#13;
cedures, to inform them of the facilities available in Bangladesh for disposal&#13;
of funds and finally to acquaint them with the opportunities available in Bangla-&#13;
desh for investment of their savings. As a starting point, a brochure :iritten&#13;
in easily intelligible Bengali language should be circulated among the existing&#13;
and prospective migrants. The brochure should contain the names and addresses&#13;
of the banks in the Middle Eastern countries who have correspondent relation-&#13;
ships with their counterparts in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi Missions abroad could&#13;
also chalk out a systematic programme to regularly brief the migrants on remit-&#13;
tance procedures and the opportunities for investment of their funds in Bangla-&#13;
de sh.&#13;
2.36      Language problems.  As many as 36 of the 189 migrants interviewed&#13;
mentioned the difficulties they encountered when they had to fill out remit-&#13;
tance forms written in Arabic language. Lack of knowledge of this language&#13;
also stands as a stumbling block for communication with bank personnel manning&#13;
the remittance counters. In fact, the problem of language follows the migrants&#13;
at every step. It is also one of the reasons why Bangladeshi workers, who are&#13;
otherwise efficient, sincere and hard working cannot successfully compete for&#13;
better jobs with their Arabic speaking counterparts from other labour supplying&#13;
Arab and non-Arab countries (Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Lebanon, Sudan, etc.). The&#13;
problem defies a quick solution, but the Bureau of Manpower may arrange a short&#13;
course on Arabic language for each batch of emigrants selected for jobs abroad.&#13;
The recruitment policy of the Bureau for overseas jobs may also be oriented&#13;
with a bias in favour of applicants possessing some degree of proficiency in&#13;
Arabic language. This will inevitably serve as an encouragement for the job&#13;
applicants to acquire at least a working knowledge of the language.&#13;
2.37      Non-cooperation of foreign bank personnel.  Language barriers apart,&#13;
foreign bank personnel generally do not cooperate with the migrants trying to&#13;
send their remittances, especially when they are small amounts. Many migrants&#13;
reported misbehaviour of the bank officials handling the banking counters.&#13;
This points to the need for establishing branches of Bangladeshi banks where&#13;
there are reasonable concentrations of Bangladesh nationals. If, however,&#13;
setting up a branch is not economically viable or local laws do not permit set-&#13;
ting up such a branch, an official from one of the nationalised banks in&#13;
Bangladesh may be posted in each of the important centres to assist the migrants.&#13;
The official may be attached to one of the local banks, but, if such an arrange-&#13;
ment cannot be made, he may be attached to the local Bangladesh Mission. The&#13;
authorities in the banks in those places may also be persuaded to hire Bangladeshi&#13;
staff.&#13;
2.38      Telecommunication link.  Janata Bank has established a direct tele-&#13;
printer link with its Abu Dhabi branch.  This has facilitated quick transfer&#13;
of remittances from Abu Dhabi.  The banks in Bangladesh, including branches of&#13;
foreign banks operating in this country, may be encouraged to establish direct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
teleprinter links with their corresponderts in the Middle Fastern regions and for&#13;
this purpose the Telegraph and Telephone Department could extend a helping&#13;
hand.&#13;
2.39      Loss of remittances.  Foreign bank drafts are sometimes lost or may be&#13;
stolen in transit, mainly from the post offices in Bangladesh; the lost drafts&#13;
are quite often encashed by fraudulent means. Funds are also at times with-&#13;
drawn from foreign currency accounts against forged signatures. Local money orders&#13;
sent by the banks to the migrants' dependents sometimes do not reach the payees&#13;
or they are paid to the wrong persons. Letters to the editor columns in the&#13;
newspapers attest to the gro,wing incidents of loss of migrants' remittances.&#13;
Disquieting reports are also received from the migrants that letters sent by&#13;
them to their dependents are read by indiscreet officials in the post offices to&#13;
keep track of their remittances; this knowledge is often used to defraud the un-&#13;
suspecting dependents. For instance, an official of the post office, armed with&#13;
knowledge about contents of previous letters written by a migrant could sub-&#13;
stitute one of the subsequent letters purporting to advise his wife, who could.&#13;
be an unsuspecting and unlettered woman, to pay money to a certain person who&#13;
would be approaching her. The ingenuity of the criminal minds does not end&#13;
here; it reportedly embraces the -hole gamut  of dirty tricks contrived to dupe&#13;
the migrants' families with coercion2 tIreat, blackn&lt;ail and even plain robbery.&#13;
Loss of money and the sense of insecurity in the minds of the migrants' families&#13;
makes the migrants hesitant to transfer money at all. To gain confidence of&#13;
the miErants, it is important that a special cell is opened in the Police&#13;
Department to track down the culprits and recover the money. At the same time,&#13;
the post office may keep a special watch over the handling of foreign niail.&#13;
'.40     Handling of remittances by banks. Important though the remittances&#13;
may be from the country's point of view, the banks do not earn enough profit by&#13;
handling the migrants' remittances.  It is perhaps for this reason that many&#13;
banks have refrained from making conscious efforts to attract migrants' remit-&#13;
tances. With the notable exception of Sonali Bank and to some extent Janata&#13;
Bank, the arran-ement in other nationalised. banks is characterised by lack of&#13;
initiative, inept handling of remittances and ,-eneral aversion to accommodate&#13;
the special needs of the migrants. The extent of involvement of the nationalised&#13;
baniks in the handling of wage earners' remittances is borne out by the following&#13;
statistics on the number of foreign currency accounts maintained at the end of&#13;
1978.&#13;
Number of Foreign&#13;
Local Banks   Currency Accounts  Percentage&#13;
Sonali Bank        21,122            56.94&#13;

Total               37,098           100.00&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
With the exception of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Ltd.,&#13;
foreign banks in Bangladesh have shown little interest in handling remittances&#13;
even though their branches, subsidiaries and affiliates in the Middle East could&#13;
enable them to ti;ke a lead.  The statistics of foreign currency accounts main-&#13;
tained by them are sho-n below:&#13;
Number of Foreign&#13;
Foreign Banks            Currency Accounts   Percentage&#13;
Bank of Credit and&#13;
Commerce International          3,051           61.90&#13;
Grindlays Bank                    873            17.71&#13;
American Express Inter-&#13;
national Banking Corp.            852            17.29&#13;
Habib Bank Ltd.                   147             2.98&#13;
Chartered Bank                      6             0.12&#13;
Total                          4,929            100.00&#13;
The statistics show that while  ome banks are trying to avoid handling wage&#13;
earrsrs' remittances, a few banks like Sonali Bank and Janata Bank are facing&#13;
mounting pressures of work, which eventually affect their standard of service.&#13;
All banks, especially the nationalised banks, need to be persuaded to share the&#13;
remittance work.  Their borrowing entitlement from the Bangladesh Bank and the&#13;
share of aided letter: of cred.it business could, among other things, be linked&#13;
to the share of migrants' remittances handled by the respective banks.  Simul-&#13;
taneously, the banks should make suitable arrangements to handle the remittances&#13;
efficiently. Among other things, the banks should arrange to keep the migrants&#13;
informed as soon as the remittances are cred.ited to their accounts or paid to&#13;
the beneficiaries and look into the complaints from the migrants with a sense&#13;
of urgency.&#13;
2.41      Disposal of remittances.  Perhaps the biggest problem the migrants and&#13;
their dependents face relates to the sale of foreign exchange remittances in the&#13;
Wage Earners Market.  As explained earlier, the bank undertakes this responsi-&#13;
bility, but for various reasons the migrants have largely refrained from m-aking&#13;
use of this channel.  Firstly, the arrangement for sale of funds through the&#13;
banks is not widely known.  Secondly, the banks normally take an unusually lon;&#13;
time to sell the funds through the auction which remains suspended sometimes for&#13;
days at a time.  Finally, the price obtained on the sale of funds in the auction&#13;
through banks is generally believed to be lower than the price that can be ob-&#13;
tained on sale through bilateral negotiations. The Wage Earners Market in general&#13;
and the auction in particular is controlled by a few brokers.  They have formed.&#13;
a sort of cartel to dictate the auction price which, curiously enough, serves as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
an index for transactions that take place outside the auction. j When the mem-&#13;
bers of the syndicate intend to accumulate funds they close their ranks and sup-&#13;
press the auction price to buy funds not only from the auction but also from&#13;
other sources more or less at the same price.  When they have succeeded in ac-&#13;
cumulating sufficient funds, they deliberately push up the price in the auction&#13;
with the intention of unloading the accumulated funds to the users outside the&#13;
auction more or less at the auction price.  Erratic demand for Wage Earners Funds&#13;
in the market also often causes frequent gluts and the prices (the Wage Earners&#13;
Rate) come d-own sharply which in turn reduces the inflow of migrants' remit-&#13;
tances.  The arrangement for sale of funds outside the auction is anything but&#13;
satisfactory.  The market is predominated by a large number of small brokers&#13;
who use the bank premises to search for migrants or their dependents who have&#13;
salable funds.  In their anxiety to receive the money as quickly as possible and&#13;
to  avoid the trouble of attending to the banking formalities, the migrants or&#13;
their dependents usually settle for a price which could be substantially lower&#13;
than the real price.  Urgent steps are needed to rid the market of undesirable&#13;
elements, to introduce an element of stability and uniformity in the prices, to&#13;
disintegrate the monopolistic hold, to take over the surplus fund that the market&#13;
cannot absorb and above all to ensure a fair return to the migrants. These&#13;
objectives could be achieved simply by periodically fixing the floor and ceiling&#13;
rates for Wage Earners Funds and entrust one or more of the banks with the&#13;
responsibility of buying and selling funds at the specified rates.  The buying&#13;
and selling rates could be fixed with a wide margin so that brokers couldi carry&#13;
out transactions at rates finer than the floor and ceiling rates. Alternatively,&#13;
a narrow margin could be prescribed which would- automatically eliminate the&#13;
brokers from the Wage Earners Market.  The latter arrangement is not suggested&#13;
in the sense that this will inevitably require the banks to handle all trans-&#13;
actions - small as well as big -- leading to extra work.&#13;
2.42      Whichever arrangement is chosen, three important issues would have to&#13;
be sorted out:&#13;
(a)  Who would bear the risks of fluctuations in the rate of exchange&#13;
of Wage Earners Funds?&#13;
(b)  Who w.:ould provide the funds needed to carry out the operation?&#13;
(c)  How would the exchange rates be fixed?&#13;
As to the first question, the banks could set aside a part o-07 1eir exchange pro-&#13;
fits arising from sale and purchase of Wage Earners Funds to absorb the losses&#13;
arising from time to time. The Government or Bangladesh Bank might, however,&#13;
compensate the banks for the losses that cannot be met from the reserve. The&#13;
funds for carrying out their operations should be provided by banks out of their&#13;
own resources, but in the event of a liquidity constraint, Banglad-esh Bank might&#13;
come to their aid.  The rates could be fixed in keeping with the market conditions;&#13;
j    The sales involving transfer of funds to a foreign currency account is&#13;
permissible, but when the buyer does not put the money into such an&#13;
account, the transaction is illegal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
a permanent committee might be appointed to keep a constant watch iver supply&#13;
and demand of the Wage Earners Fund and revise the rates from time to time at&#13;
an equilibrium level.&#13;
2.43      Taka drafts.  Recipients of foreign exchange remittances are located&#13;
all over the country, but the markets for the disposal of these remittances are&#13;
located in Dacca with subsidiary markets at Sylhet and Chittagong.  The recip-&#13;
ients in other areas are, therefore, required to travel to these places to find&#13;
buyers of foreign currency drafts and other kinds of instruments received from&#13;
migrants. Migrants visiting Bangladesh are also required to stop over at Dacca&#13;
for a couple of days to sell foreign currency brought into the country. To&#13;
remove these difficulties, the Bangladeslh Ambassador to UAE has suggested that&#13;
Janata Bank branches in UAE could issue Taka drafts to cover home remittances&#13;
of the migrants.  The amount of a draft would be worked out at the Wage Earners&#13;
Rate which would be supplied by the bank's Dacca office daily or as frequently&#13;
as possible. It would be payable at any of the bank's network of branches in&#13;
Bangladesh according to the wishes of the migrants.  Wherever possible, a&#13;
similar arrangement could be made in other locations in the Middle East by&#13;
enlisting the support of the local banks there.&#13;
2.44      RemitLance bonds.  The idea of Taka drafts could be further refined&#13;
to make the remittance job easy for everyone. In its refined form, a special&#13;
kind of instrument or remittance bond could be sold to Bangladeshi migrants&#13;
through overseas branches of correspondents of Bangladeshi banks.  If necessary,&#13;
these sales could be arranged by posting an official of the bank in the Bangla-&#13;
desh Missions.  The instrument could be printed with fixed denominations in&#13;
Taka and payable to the bearer at any of the branches of the bank issuing it;&#13;
its sale price in foreign exchan-e would, like Taka drafts, be determined at&#13;
the Wage Earners Rate. An additional feature could be ad.ded to the remittance&#13;
bond by making a provision for payment of interest at fixed rates for the period&#13;
a bond is held by the holder before encashment; the rates could be made pro-&#13;
gressively higher for longer periods.  This scheme should serve as a natural&#13;
incentive for the migrants and their families to pursue saving habits.&#13;
E. Effects of Remittance Money on Money Supply&#13;
Impact of Remittance Supply&#13;
2.45      An attempt is made here to evaluate the impact of migrants' remit-&#13;
tances on domestic money supply. One of the causes for the higher inflation&#13;
now prevailing in the country is popularly believed to be the migrants' remit-&#13;
tances. As mentioned earlier, migrants' remittances are not taken into the&#13;
country's foreign exchange reserves. Neither the Central Bank nor the commercial&#13;
banks maintaining the accounts can create local currency against the deposits&#13;
maintained in foreign currency accounts.  As such these remittances do not add&#13;
directly to the money supply.  Ho:yever, there is an indirect impact on the total&#13;
money supply in the country which tends to influence the general price level.&#13;
At present most of the imports under the Wage Earners Scheme are made against&#13;
irrevocable letters of credit.  Under the existing rules, before letters of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
cred.it can be opened, 10c% margin in foreign exchange has to be kept on deposit&#13;
by the importer at the bank opening the letter of credit. The importer has to&#13;
purchase this foreign exchange from the account holder or his nominee. There&#13;
is a time lag ranging from a few weeks to a few months before goods against the&#13;
letter of credit reach Bangladesh anda are available in the market. Meanwhile,&#13;
the Taka fund received by the beneficiary or the remitter finds its way into&#13;
the market.  If the Taka fund is kept on deposit with the banks this enlarges&#13;
the resource base of the banks and contributes to an increase in money supply.&#13;
On the other hand, if the funds are spent by the beneficiary on shopping, this&#13;
exerts pressure directly on supplies in the market. Commercial banks are also&#13;
allowed to extend credit at the official rate to the importers and members of&#13;
the Stock Exchange (brokers) who deal in the Wage Earmers Fund.  This also&#13;
generates an additional money supply in the economy.  However, such loans are&#13;
negligible compared to the overall bank credit.&#13;
2.46      Transfer effect.  Through sale of funds in foreign exchange, Taka&#13;
funds are transferred from importers to the remitters or beneficiaries. The&#13;
beneficiaries by and large belong to the low income group, at least until they&#13;
start receiving the remittance money. They make efforts to improve their&#13;
standard of living and in the process they begin to obtain various consumer&#13;
items which are normally in short supply in the country. After the initial&#13;
spending phase on consumer items is over, they start buying land. Investment&#13;
in land can in no way be construed as capital investment since it does not give&#13;
rise to any addition to productive capacity.  The net result is that in the&#13;
rural area where there is a concentration of such migrants, land prices go up&#13;
so high that small farmers and farmers with very little land are tempted to&#13;
dispose of their holdings at a lucrative price instead of cultivating their un-&#13;
economic holdings; in the process they themselves swell the ranks of landless&#13;
peasants.  The migrants -ho are relatively sophisticated and ed.ucated try to&#13;
acquire a piece of land in any of the urban centres like Dacca, Chittagong,&#13;
Khulna or Sylhet and construct residential houses either for their o-:n eventual&#13;
accommodation or for lease. This also cannot be called a very productive use&#13;
of funds, neither this sort of house construction adds to the improvement of&#13;
the overall housing situa'tion in a land-starved place like Dacca as the construc-&#13;
tion cost has become prohibitive. The rents charged for the houses are pro-&#13;
hibitive and consequently it does not substantially lessen the pressure on&#13;
housing.  FTrom various sketchy studies prepared. by different institutions from&#13;
time to time it has been observed that very few people are encouraged to invest&#13;
in Government Savings Bonds or securities. In the Stock Exchange there are&#13;
very few scrips which can attract migrantst savings into productive investment.&#13;
The only economic benefit that the migrants' transfers have vested on the economy&#13;
is in the form of balance of payments support by way of enlarged imports, most&#13;
of which are consumer goods intended for higher income groups encouraging con-&#13;
spicuous consumption.&#13;

F. Use of Remittance Money for Financing Imports&#13;
2.47      A major portion of foreign exchange sent by the migrants to Bangladesh&#13;
is used. for financing imports into Bangladesh undcer the Wage Earners Scheme.&#13;
Here is a statistical overview of the goods and commodities imported und.er the&#13;
Wa e Earners Scheme followed by a discussion on the impact of these imports on&#13;
the national economy and the policy choices confronting the import trade control&#13;
authorities.&#13;
2.48      Level of Imports.  Appendix Table 44 presents a breakdown of the&#13;
goods imported annually under the Wage Earners Scheme since the inception of&#13;
the Wage Earners Scheme. In preparing this Table, an attempt has been made to&#13;
classify the goods into four major groups:  essential consumer goods, inessential&#13;
consumer goods, capital goods and raw materials.  Appendix Table 43 summarizes&#13;
the annual level of imports in each group along with an explanatory note on&#13;
the principles observed in classifying the imports into these categories. The&#13;
following are the annual level of imports under the Wage Earners Scheme; the&#13;
figures in parentheses indicate the increase in the level of imports compared&#13;
to that of 1975 - the first full year of operation of the Scheme.&#13;
Table 2.6: IMPORTS UNDER THE WAGE EARNERS SCHEME&#13;
(Taka in million)&#13;
1974 (July to December)               104.85&#13;
1975                                  489.37 (100%)&#13;
1976                                  734.39 (150%)&#13;
1977                                1,058.67 (216%o)&#13;
1978                                1,479.12 (302%)&#13;
1979 (January to September)         1,460.67&#13;
Based on the past trend and value of goods imported during the first 9 months&#13;
of 1979, the index for 1979 is projected to reach the 400% mark denoting a&#13;
fourfold rise in the level of imports in comparison to that of the base year&#13;
(1975)-&#13;
2.49      Composition of goods.  There is no limit to the quantity and value of&#13;
goods that an individual merchant can import under the Wage Earners Scheme.&#13;
The list of goods imported. under the scheme covers a wide variety of items in-&#13;
cluding those not licensed for import against normal foreign exchange earnings.&#13;
This laissez faire attitude in the import trade und.er the Wage Earners Scheme&#13;
quite often generates controversy from economic, social and. even ethical points&#13;
of view. There are strong advocates for monitoring these imports to protect&#13;
domestic industries, at least on a selective basis, and to cut down importation&#13;
of luxury goods. Before engaging in a discussion on this aspect of the import&#13;
policy, the composition of goods that are imported under the Wc&amp;e Earners Scheme&#13;
needs to be examined.&#13;
(a)  Essential consumer goods.  In 1978 the import value of goods&#13;
classified as essential consumer good.s worked out to Tk. 194.69&#13;
million representing only about 13% of the total value of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
imports under the Wage Earners Scheme.  Second-hand clothes&#13;
occupied a very prominent position in the list of essential&#13;
consumer goods. Second-hand clothes, which consist mostly of&#13;
warm clothing and are used by the poorer section of society,&#13;
accounted for 8y,% of the total import value of essential con-&#13;
sumer goods. Next in importance were betelnuts, which accounted&#13;
for 14% of the import value of goods in this category.&#13;
(b) Inessential consumer goods. This group, which accounted for&#13;
17%o of the aggregate value of goods impcrted under the Wage&#13;
Earners Scheme in 1978, included assorted goods generally used&#13;
by consumers belongirg to relatively higher income groups.&#13;
Prominent items in this group were motor cars (which accounted&#13;
for 35% of the aggregate value of inessential consumer goods&#13;
imported in 1978), spices (11%), locks (1C%), fruits (9%), filter&#13;
tip ciearettes (5%) razor blades (3%), smokers requisites (3%),&#13;
tyres and tubes (3%o, t6ilet requisites (2%), and bamboo (2%).&#13;
(c)  Capital  oods.  Capital goods raniced lowest in terms of value;&#13;
in 1978 the import value of goods belonging to this category&#13;
accounted for only 9.4% of the overall value of all import s under&#13;
the Wage Earners Scheme. In this list, transport vehicles like&#13;
trucks and buses, tugs and passenger vessels, and marine diesel&#13;
engines accounted ^or 24% of the total value of imports in thiz&#13;
group. Factory machines were next in importance accounting for&#13;
21 .6% of the value of capital goods imported in 1978.&#13;
(d)  Raw materials.  Contrary to popular belief, the lion's share of&#13;
the wage earners funds are used for importation of what can be&#13;
broadly classified as rawf materials, including intermediary&#13;
goods. In 1978, commodities belonging to this group accounted&#13;
for 64 of the overall value of all imports under the Wage Earners&#13;
Scheme.  Cotton and synthetic textiles claimed about 35%O of the&#13;
value of all imports in this group and 22% of the a-gregate value&#13;
of all imports under the Wage Earners Scheme in 1978. Also im-&#13;
portant were cotton yarn (25%), dyes and chemicals (7%) and&#13;
industrial spares (6%).&#13;
2.50      The preponderance of luxury imports in the Wage Earners Scheme can be&#13;
clearly seen from the above data.  Approximately 13% of the foreign exchange&#13;
remitted by the migrants is used for importation of inessential consumer goods.&#13;
A second look at the list of raw materials imported under the Wage Earners&#13;
Scheme would also establish that a large amount of the wage earners' foreign&#13;
exchange remittances is used to import raw materials that are eventually con-&#13;
verted into luxury goods. A reasonable estimate would put the share of&#13;
finished luxury goods and raw materials for luxury goods at about 5C% of the&#13;
total value of goods imported under the scheme. An important feature that&#13;
emerges from a studiy of the trend of imports is that imports of inessential&#13;
consumer goods in 1978 increased by 44% over the level of imports in the&#13;
preceding year, while the essential consumer goods recorded a fall of 23%&#13;
during the same period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
2.51      Viewed in the context of the  lKaborate supervision and control over&#13;
imocrts into Bangladesh under the Cash Licencing Scheme, the laissez faire&#13;
al-titude urder the Wage Earners Scheme appears to be rather paradoxical.  The&#13;
situation is perhaps borne out of a mistaken belief that migrants' remittances&#13;
are a. wirndfall which could be squandered away on frivolous pu-pcses.  Despite&#13;
what is told about the virtue of freedom in the sphere of import tra'1.&gt;, there&#13;
is a strong case for monitoring these imports principally on the fo-Ic.,ing&#13;
grounds:&#13;
(a)  Unhcl-&lt;;12-  imports retard growth aa-id :-xpan ion of local indlustries.&#13;
It is true that the local demand for certain items is far too&#13;
small to set up economically viable industrial units, but there&#13;
are, maxy irt.'.stries which could be identified and protected.&#13;
from the competition of imported goods. In the absence of con-&#13;
scious efforts to develop and pro{-ect the domestic industzn-,&#13;
the country will find it increasingly difficult to break away&#13;
from the dependence on imported items.  Worse still, once the&#13;
coisumers develop the taste for imported goods, they will be&#13;
reluctant to change to domestically produced goods even if the&#13;
increasie in the size of dema2lC.   (-;c.e.rtain categories of goods&#13;
Could otherwise justify establishment of domestic units for&#13;
production of those items.&#13;
(b)  Increased demand for foreign exchange arising from inclusion&#13;
of a large .number of inessential items in the list of importable&#13;
goods under "he Wage Earners Scheme is responsible for lowering&#13;
the open market value of Taka beyond its official value.  This&#13;
has the effect of negating the efforts ms.de to unify the unof-&#13;
ficial and official exchange rates through excharj,&#143;e and import&#13;
controls - a goal cherished by the monetary authority of every&#13;
country.  Higher prices of foreifLY, ¢,cchan-ge in the Wage Earrers&#13;
Market also serve as a damper to the import of otherwise desirable&#13;
investments and essential goods. It is important to undertake&#13;
an indepth study to measure the effects of wage earners' imports&#13;
on the economy of the country and to suggest measur. to channel&#13;
the foreign exchange sent by the migrants into most productive&#13;
uses.&#13;
G.  Remittable Savings and Actual Remittan&lt;es&#13;
2.52      According to a rough estimate based on the number of Bangladesh&#13;
nationals (178,521) who had been working abroad by the end of 1978, inclm'Jni.g&#13;
the migr-vetts in the U.K., and the a-mount of foreign exchange (equivalent to&#13;
Tk. 2,120 million)  oenr . he,r:  TVy these migrants during that year, the average&#13;
level of remittance per migrant works out to Tk. 990 per mionth or T-Ja 11,68e&#13;
per year-.  This figure is far too low compored to the amount a migrant is ab].e&#13;
to save out of his earnings. This phenomenon also points to the possibility&#13;
of increasin_ tie :f'Low of remittances by providing adequate incentives to the&#13;
Bangladeshi workers to '-eynt money home and by creating additional outlets for&#13;
investment of the money sent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
2.53      The available data are inadequate to estimate the level of savings&#13;
per worker.  The 189 Bangladeshi migrants in the Middle East who were inter-&#13;
viewed in the middle of 1979 for the purpose of this study had an average earning&#13;
of Tk. 165,714 (Vs$10,691) per year, while the average savings had been&#13;
Tk. 7,000 per month or Tk. 84,000 (US$5,600) per year. This means that a mi-&#13;
grant saves roughly 51% of his earnings.  The propensity to save would be&#13;
still higher among the unskilled workers. The estimate of Perwaiz (Pakistan:&#13;
Home Remittances 1979, p. 66) showed that only 48% is spent and 60C% is saved.&#13;
2.54      Evidently, the level of savings of the migrants more or less permanently&#13;
settled in places like the U.K. and the U.S. would be lower than the percentage&#13;
of the earnings saved by the migrants in the Middle East and North Africa who&#13;
tend to be temporary workers who loek forward to returning to Bangladesh after&#13;
they have been able to save a reasonable amount of money. Even if we limit&#13;
our calculations to Bangladeshi migrants in the Middle East and North Africa,&#13;
it would be clear that they are not remitting their full potential. From&#13;
Appendix Table 20 it can be seen that remittances through banking channels in&#13;
1978 from this area amounted to Tk. 651 million.  Adding 28% for direct im-&#13;
ports, the total estimated remittances works out to Tk. 833 million.  Based&#13;
on an estimated number of 93,521 workers resident in that area in 1978, the&#13;
annual average remittance per worker was only Tk. 742 per month or Tk. 8,907&#13;
per year.  Even if it is assumed that all workers are unskilled who are known&#13;
to earn at least US$3,600 (Tk. 55,800) per year and save US$1,836 (Tk. 28,458)&#13;
which is 51% of their income, it would appear that they are remitting only 31%&#13;
of their savings.&#13;
2.55      An obvious explanation why the migrants are not remitting their full&#13;
potential is that a sizeable portion of their funds are diverted to the black&#13;
market principally for the following purposes:&#13;
(a)  Goods and commodities worth millions of Taka are imported into&#13;
Bangladesh by the incoming passengers free of d.uty under what can&#13;
be called very liberal baggage rules. Although there are cer-&#13;
tain limits on the value of goods that a passenger can import&#13;
these limits are more often than not exceeded.  There are even&#13;
reports that goods are imported on a commercial basis free of&#13;
d.uty in the garb of personal baggage.&#13;
(b)  A large amount of the foreign exchange earnings of the migrants&#13;
are suspected to be used to finance goods smuggled into Bangla-&#13;
desh.  Gold is by far the major item smuggled into the country,&#13;
followed by wrist watches and similar items of high value compared&#13;
to their bulk.&#13;
(c)  Because of heavy customs duty and sales tax on most items im-&#13;
ported into Bangladesh there is always a strong tendency to&#13;
under-invoice these imports. The amount constituting the&#13;
actual price and the invoice price is paid out of foreign ex-&#13;
change acquired in the black market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
(d)  Export of some items like jute and jute goods are subject to a&#13;
minimum export price. When the international price level goes&#13;
below that price, the exporters generally undercut the price&#13;
but show the minimum export price on the invoices. The dif-&#13;
ference is paid to the buyers by acquiring foreign exchange in&#13;
the black market.&#13;
(e)  Sale proceeds of properties and other assets, particularly of&#13;
the non-residents, are transferred through the black market.&#13;
The foreign exchange for this purpose chiefly comes from the&#13;
currency racketeers who are engaged in clandestinely mopping&#13;
up remittable savings of the migrants.&#13;
H. Measures to Increase the Flowf of Remittances&#13;
2.56      The most talked about adverse effect generally attributed to migrants'&#13;
remittances is that the income in Bangladesh in the hands of the migrants and&#13;
their dependents is used for unproductive purposes, chiefly for purchase of&#13;
real estate. Another disquieting feature is that many migrants refrain from&#13;
sending money to the extent they  ould have otherwise done if suitable in-&#13;
vestment opportunities were available in Bangladesh. There cannot be two&#13;
opinions about the need for opening new investment outlets to tackle the twin&#13;
problems of indaucing the migrants to send more remittances and to divert the&#13;
remittance money to productive channels.&#13;
2.57      Unfortunately, odds are very heavy against attracting migrants'&#13;
savings into productive channels.  The market for traditional investment papers&#13;
like stocks, shares and debentures are practically non-existent; nor do these&#13;
securities suit the habits of the vast majority of the migrants aho come from&#13;
relatively unsophisticated backgrounds.  Government savings certificates offer&#13;
attractive yields, but due to lack of dynamism in the marketing methods  and&#13;
inappropriate sales pitches, these papers remain out of reach of most people.&#13;
The same -oes for the postal savinCs certificates and other savings programmes&#13;
of the Postal Department. The only thing that comes nearer to the preference&#13;
of most people is the Prize Bond, a kind of bearer bond on which prizes are&#13;
given through draws held every second month.  The Investment Corporation of&#13;
Bangladesh and lately the International Finance and Investment Company are&#13;
reportedly trying to provide investment and portfolio management services to&#13;
both private and institutional clients, but none of them have been able to make&#13;
a real breakthrough. Their principal handicap is the non-existence of suitable&#13;
opportunities for profitable investment of mutual funds. They also lack ex-&#13;
pertise to handle the complex investment problems which produce maximum bene-&#13;
fits for the customers.  Despite the obvious limitations, certain areas of&#13;
investment activities could be identifiea. to secure participation of Bangladeshi&#13;
migrants.  These are discussed in the following paragraphs.&#13;
2.58      Investment in industries.  Bangladesh national  working abroad are&#13;
now given adequate fiscal facilities and incentives to set up industries in&#13;
Bangladesh.  However, the responses from Bangladesh nationals to this overture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
are far from encouraging.  This could mainly be attributed to:&#13;
(a)  Lack of information about opportunities available in Bangladesh&#13;
for establishment of industrial units.&#13;
(b) Inadequate information of market conditions.&#13;
(c)  Inadequate facilities available in Bangladesh to carry out&#13;
feasibility studies and to draw up project plans.&#13;
(d)  Lack of knowledge about the procedure and requirements involved&#13;
in securini' permission from the Government departments, obtain-&#13;
ing loans from the financing agencies.&#13;
(e)  Cumbersome, dilatory and irritating procedures encountered by&#13;
the entrepreneurs trying to obtain permission to set up industries,&#13;
to secure allotment of land, to get physical facilities like&#13;
construction materials, water and power connections, and. so on.&#13;
The problems mentioned cannot be overcome easily and quickly, but the very&#13;
least that can be done is to entrust one single agency to  ork .ith various&#13;
Government and semi-Government agencies and as ist the migrants to take p rt&#13;
in the industrixl activities through a system of what could be called one window&#13;
service. Other&gt;ise all the pious intentions to draw the migrants into the&#13;
mainstre.m of industrial activity through fiscal incentives ill come to&#13;
naught.&#13;
2.59      Special bond-. As mentioned earlier, the Prize Bond is the most&#13;
commonly understood investment paper. It carries with it the dream of a big&#13;
windfall -- an appeal. that for most people in this country probably outweighs&#13;
the charm of steady but relatively smaller returns. In the context of the present&#13;
price structure, its denomination (Tk. 10) is far too small compared to its&#13;
bulk which creates the problem of storage and handling, especially for the mi-&#13;
grants who would like to keep the bonds in their own cu tody.  Also, inflation&#13;
has eroded the vSlue of the prizes several times over. Special kinds of Prize&#13;
Bonds could be introduced with hi-her denominations, say Tk. 500, and arrange-&#13;
ments could be made to sell these to overseas Bangladesh nationals in foreign&#13;
currency at Wage Earners Rates through  foreign branches and correspondents&#13;
of the banks in Bangladesh and Bangladesh Missions. This scheme could meet&#13;
with instant success if a few of the top prizes were allotmen-ts of land in the&#13;
urban areas in lieu of ca-h since practically all migrants, eyspecially those&#13;
in the Middle East, look forward to eventually settling down in Bangladesh.&#13;
To them, owning land in an urban area is a very strong incentive.&#13;
2.60      Other measures.  The Saving Directorate may chalk out a special&#13;
programme to popularize the saving certificate among the migrvnts; wherever&#13;
possible, the saving certificates would be made physically available for sale&#13;
among the Bangladeshi communities abroad.   If necessary, additional features&#13;
could be introduced in the saving certificates to make them more attractive.&#13;
The nationalised life insurance company, the Jiban Bima Corporation, also needs&#13;
to step up its efforts to sell insurance policies to Bangladesh nationals working&#13;
abroAd.&#13;

CHAPTER III&#13;
AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF REMITTANCE MONEY ON&#13;
HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE IN BANGLADESH&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
3.1       The export of manpower has become an important source of foreign ex-&#13;
change for the country. The foreign exchange earned through this source was&#13;
second only to the total amount earned by raw jute and jute goods which are the&#13;
countrylsa major export earners.  Since foreign exchange is a scarce resource for&#13;
the country, export of manpower is considered desirable on this ground. There is,&#13;
however, another untested but strong hypothesis in this context which maintains&#13;
that much ,r the remittances received are squandered on conspiY;r.1ous consumption,&#13;
expenditure on unproductive assets like ornaments, and speculative expenditure on&#13;
land, houses, etc. If true, this hypothesis can have important implications for&#13;
policies related to the export of manpower. It must be recognized that the level&#13;
of sayings in the economy of Bangladesh is suboptimal, hence, any increase in&#13;
consump-tion, especially by those in the upper income groups, has to be treated as&#13;
a cost to the society. Moreover, any conspicuous consumption in the society is&#13;
likely to have a demonstration effect and lead to social tensions. The social&#13;
costs associated with these secondary repercussions of increased consumption made&#13;
possible by an inflow of remittance money have to be added tc other social costs,&#13;
so that a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the exyoprt of manpower can be&#13;
made.&#13;
3.2       In view of the importance of the use of remittance money to the economy&#13;
of Bangladesh, the present study aims at analysing the expenditure pattern of the&#13;
households which receive remittances from migrants working abroad. The hypotheses&#13;
to be tested in the present study can be written as follows:&#13;
(a)  In the aggregate, spending behaviour of househol,i.s receiving&#13;
remittance money is different from that of the households re-&#13;
ceiving no such money.&#13;
(b)  The composition of spending (and investing) is different for the&#13;
two categories of households mentioned above.  In other wor('s,&#13;
out of any increment of income, the first category of households&#13;
spend more on luxury items or non-productive assets like land,&#13;
houses, ornaments, etc.&#13;
(c)  The remittance receiving households devote a large part of the&#13;
money they receive to the purchase of the assets mentiored above.&#13;
3.3       The paper is organized as folloiws.  Fir-;t the sampling methodology and&#13;
the nethod of generating data and the important characteristics of thie sample are&#13;
described.  After this the first two hypotheses mentionled above are examined&#13;
while the third hypothesis is taken up in the next section. This section also&#13;
looks at the various uses to which the remittance money is put.  Finally some&#13;
coricluding observaticis are presented.&#13;

B.  The Data and the Sampling Methodology&#13;
3.4       In order to look into the expenditure pattern of those household.s which&#13;
receive remittances  from abroad as well as those who do not receive any such&#13;
income an income-expenditure survey for both types of households was required.&#13;
For this purpose, a scientific sample was drawn on a national basis and a struc-&#13;
tured questionnaire was used.&#13;
The Sampling Methodolg&#13;
3.5       Since 1977, the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (IMET) has&#13;
kept basic information about the migrant workers. In order to stud.y the profile&#13;
of migrant workers J BIMET drew a 1o/. sample from its list, and this was taken as&#13;
the principal source of names and ad-dresses for the household. income-expenditure&#13;
survey.  These 3X000 migrants were accepted. as the sampling frame for the study.&#13;
3.6       The selection of sample households for this purpose was d.one in several&#13;
steps. The first stage was the selection of districts into which investigators&#13;
were to be sent for interviewing. It was presumed that not more than two or&#13;
three districts supply a majority of migrant workers, so four districts were&#13;
selected for the household survey.  Rather than choosing the four leading dis-&#13;
tr-icts arbitrarily, a probability method. was used  for this selection.  BEMET&#13;
supplied the districtwise distribution of the migrants of both rural and. urban&#13;
origin.  Working first with the rural addresses four districts out of a total of&#13;
19 were selected in such a way that the probability of each being selected is&#13;
proportional to the number of addresses belonging to that district.  These four&#13;
districts were Chittagong, Dacca, Noakhali and Sylhet.  In the next stage, the&#13;
addresses of the selected districts were grouped by thanas in which they are located.&#13;
The distribution was such that some of the thanas had a very high concentration of&#13;
addresses while many had a small number of addresses.  In view of this, the thanas&#13;
were grouped into two strata - one group containing those with high concentrations&#13;
and the other containing those with low concentrations of adldresses. Finally one&#13;
thana was selected from each of these strata, again according to the probability&#13;
method.  Thus eight thanas were selected. from the four selected districts into&#13;
which investigators went to interview households in rural areas.&#13;
3.7       Thus, at the end of the second stage, there were addresses in eight&#13;
thanas of four districts.  It was foiLnd that the number of addresses in the&#13;
selected thanas was too large compared to the amount of resources available for&#13;
the study, so the sample size had to be limited further.  It was decided that&#13;
the total number of households to be interviewed in the rural areas would be&#13;
around 200.  The number of housieho &gt;is interviewed from each of the eight thanas&#13;
was proportional to the share of addresses located. in it. 2/  Table 3.1 showsi&#13;
%/   See Chapter I.&#13;
g/  There was only one address in one of the thanas of Sylhet district, there-&#13;

the distribution of sample household-s of the rural area. The actual households&#13;
were purposively selected by the interviewers from among the given addresses. ij&#13;
In some cases, however, no reKpondent was found at the given addre ses.  In these&#13;
cases, the interviewers were instructed to substitute an address selected from&#13;
the locality on the basis of information obtained from knowledgeable persions.&#13;

3.8       The urban addresses were also grouped into distri ts in which they were&#13;
located.  Two districts (Chittagong and Dacca) were selected by the probability&#13;
method.  It was found that all the addresses in these two districts were located&#13;
in the district headquarters, but they were more numerous than could be inter-&#13;
viewed given the limited resources.  It was decided to interview  100 households&#13;
from the urban areas, and. that the number of households to be interviewed from&#13;
each of the cities should be proportional to the number of addresses located in&#13;
them.  The actual selection of addresses was done by random sampling. However,&#13;
j/  In order to keep biases to a minimum, the actual households should have been&#13;
selected at random, as was done in the case of urban areas.  But even within&#13;
a thana the households were so widely scattered over a large number of vil-&#13;
lages that the administering of the questionnaires over a set of randomly&#13;
selected households would. have demanded much more time and resources than&#13;
were available. Distance frorm the thana headquarters waL. the only criterion&#13;
which was allowed to enter the purposive selection process.&#13;

3.9       Households from which one or more worker has migranted to the Middle&#13;
East countries will be referred to as sub-sample A, and those  from whio}1 no one&#13;
has migrated. will be referred to as sub-sample 13.  A simple method was used to&#13;
select households in the latter group.  Corresponding to each household of&#13;
sub-sarple A' the interviewers selected one household from the same loon ty&#13;
which had a roughly comparable le-vel of income but did not have any migrant&#13;
worker. In this way it was possible to interview an equal number of households&#13;
from both rural and urban areas for sub-sample B. The sample size for the&#13;
present study is shown below:&#13;

The iestionnaire, Survey and Data&#13;
3.10      In order to collect necessary data from the sample households, the&#13;
interview method was used and a structured questionnaire was given to the inter-&#13;
viewers.  The questionnaire was designed to generate data which would help test&#13;
the hypotheses mentioned above.  In addition, an attempt was also made to assess&#13;
the attitude of the respondents towards investments for productive purposes, and&#13;
to identify the directions along which special encouragement may be provided&#13;
with a view to promoting productive investment. The questionnaire contained the&#13;
following types of questions and items of investigation:&#13;
(a)  Questions about the migrant worker(s).&#13;
(b)  Questions about the members of the household.&#13;
(c)  Questions about the income of the household and its sources.&#13;
(d)  Questions about the quality of housing and other indicators of the&#13;
level of living.&#13;
(e)  Questions about the ownership of land and other assets.&#13;
(f)  Questions about the expenditure pattern of the household.&#13;
(g)  Questions about the purchase of consumer durables.&#13;
(h)  Questions about the purchase of land.&#13;
(i)  Questions about the construction of houses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
(j)  Questions about investments  for purposaz like agricu3'ure, industry&#13;
or business.&#13;
(k)  Questions designed to assess the attitudce towards investments  for&#13;
productive purposes.&#13;
The questionnaire was pretested in two roundas -  the  first round. in MAarch 1979&#13;
and the second round. in April 1979.  Since sample addresses had not been selected&#13;
before the first round of pretesting, there were two alternative ways of sel-&#13;
ecting the respondents.  The first was to collect the rames and ad.dresses of&#13;
nominees from banks having foreign currency accounts of the migrants. The second&#13;
was to visit areas from which large numbers of migrants are known to have left&#13;
the country and select a few respondeiits from among the households having re-&#13;
lations working abroad.  Both these methods were used. by the interviewers and&#13;
20 households were interviewed.&#13;
3.11      Several difficulties were faced. in reaching the respond.ent through the&#13;
first method..  First, the names and. addresses of the nominees could only be ob-&#13;
tained from the account opening forms in the banks; and it was administratively&#13;
difficult to find. out addresses in this way.  Second, in many cases, no norminee&#13;
was listed.  Third, the nominee was not always competent enough to become a res-&#13;
pondent, for in some cases, the nominee was just an intermediary through which&#13;
the remittance money was passed. on to the ultimate users,&#13;
3.12      In the light of the expe_'riences gained during the first pretesting, a&#13;
second. round of pretesting was und.ertaken during April 1979.  This time sarmple&#13;
addresses were available, but the experience was quite interesting.  Ten addresses&#13;
were selected. from a rural area and. 8 from an urban area (all of them were from&#13;
the large sample drawn by IHMET and. referred. to earlier) where familie.-. of migrants&#13;
could reasonably be expected. to be living.  Surprisingly, no such family was found&#13;
in any of the addresses.  The urban addresses did have residents but they had no&#13;
knowledge of the migrant who recorded the address with BIYET.  The rural addresses&#13;
appeared even more dubious.  However, the investigators succeeded in interviewing&#13;
some families who receive remittances from abroad. In most cases, the local&#13;
people of the area they visited helped them locate such families.  One important&#13;
lesson which was learnt from this pretesting was that some of the migrant workers&#13;
do leave fictitious addresses at BMET, and these addresses may be of no help in.&#13;
2eaching the families of migrant workers.  That is why the investigators were in-&#13;
structed. to replace the samlple addresses by other respondents whenever no res-&#13;
pond.ent was found in the sample addresses.&#13;
3.13      Modifications were made in the questionnaire in the light of experiences&#13;
gained d.uring pretesting.  Necessary instructions were also provided with the&#13;
questionnaire.  Investigators were trained not only at the desk but also in the&#13;
field, through trial interviews.  Only after they had demonstrated a reasonable&#13;
degree of efficiency in filling out the schedules were they sent to do the actual&#13;
survey.  This method of training the investigators helped to keep the number of&#13;
rejected ochedules to a very low level.  In all) only six schedules had to be&#13;
rejected for various reasons.  However, difficulties were still faced in filling&#13;
out the schedules.   aLrst, in -any cases, the respondents became quite apprehen-&#13;
sive about the purpose of the entire exercise and tried to avoid the investigators.&#13;
Thist of course, was expected in a survey like this where the respond.ents were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
asked questions on such sensitive issues as income, expenditure, investments,&#13;
remittances received and their uses.  Each of the respondents, therefore, had&#13;
to be apprised, of tue real piurpose of the survey, and some of them had to be&#13;
approached through local government people or other local people in whom the&#13;
responder.t had. confidence. Another difficulty emerged. from the fact that almost&#13;
none of the households seem to keep any account of expenditures. Thus it became&#13;
very difficult for them to give an itemwise breakd.own of the expenditures incurred.&#13;
during a given period.  It was only after a sufficient amount of probing that a&#13;
reasonably consistent set of answers could be obtained. It also appeared. that&#13;
iost of the respondents mad.e rio distinction between income earned by themselves&#13;
and remittances received from abroad in their normal day-to-day expenditures.&#13;
It thus often became difficult to identify the specific uses to which the remit-&#13;
tance money was put.  Despite these and many other difficulti.es faced by the&#13;
investigators during the survey, the set of data generated appears to be of a&#13;
reasonably good quality. The analysis in the subsequent sections of this paper&#13;
is based. on this data.&#13;
C. Characteristics of _theSample&#13;
Profile of the Migrants&#13;
3.14      Age, education, previous and present occupations of the migrant workers&#13;
have important implications for the costs aiLd benefits associated. with the export&#13;
of manpower. For example, if a country loses its working age population, there&#13;
iay ke a serious impact on production.  For a country like Bangladesh which already&#13;
is facing an unfavourable dependency ratio, the imrplications of an exodus of&#13;
working age population can be quite serious.  Moreover, the loss of educated and&#13;
skilled nanpower would mean a cost to the society in the  form of the costs of&#13;
education and training of the migrant workers.  Occupation of the migrant workers&#13;
before emigration is also irip'-:tant because this will determine the cost to the&#13;
-ocid-ty in the form of lost productior=  If, for example, an unemployed person&#13;
emigrates, the loss of prod.uction in the economy may be nil.  If, on the other&#13;
ham3; t4ie migrant worker is  from sur-T- ai! c(cupatioQ  where it is d.ifficult to&#13;
replace him, the loss of prod.uction caused by 1bis oii-:v  cn can be considerable.&#13;
In the case of temporary migration, the present occupation of the migrant workers&#13;
is a]so important frOLm a cos.-benefit viewpoint.  1For1 if a migrant worker acquires&#13;
additioral skill and technical knowledge in the course of his work and come; back&#13;
to the country as a -Cr- rlilled worker and a better technical hand, this may&#13;
mean a benefit to the society.&#13;
3.15      Table 3.2 shows that more than 70r% of the migrant workers are between&#13;
20 and. 35 years of age. This proportion is even higher (nearly 8 % ) for the workers&#13;
of urban origin.  On the other hand, the proportion of migrant workers aged less&#13;
than 15 years is zero and those older than 55 years is negligible.  It is thus&#13;
clear that an overwhelming majority of the migrant workers come from the youn- and&#13;
active section of the population.&#13;

Arts to engineering graditates, Master's Degree holders in engineering, and Master's&#13;
Degree holders in various subjects).  It is interesting to note that more than 25%&#13;
of the migrants of urban origin are graduates. It must be remembered that in&#13;
Bangladeslh, the percentage of male population aged 15 years and above who com-&#13;
pleted 13 or more years of education j is only 1.4%, LI therefore the proportion&#13;
of graduates among the migrant workers appears quite high.&#13;

3.17      Looking at the occupation of the migrant workers before emigration&#13;
(Table 3.4) nLearljy 29% of them were either unemployed or students.  Hence their&#13;
migration should not directly cause any loss of production in the econory.&#13;
Another 31% of the workers are reported to be unskilled.  The loss of these un-&#13;
skilled workers should not cost the economy much for there is a surplus of such&#13;
workers. Thus it appears that the cost to the society in terms of the impact on&#13;
production is small for the migration of nearly 6C% of the workers. On the other&#13;
hand.? skilled workers, technical hands and professionals constitute 30% of the&#13;
migrants.  And the costs associated with their migration can be cuite significant&#13;
both in terms of the impact on production and the costs of ed.ucation and training.&#13;
More professionals and more unemployed have migrated from the urban centres&#13;
compared to rural areas.  Nearly 12%o of the mi_rants of urban origin were profes-&#13;
sionals compared. to less than 1% of the rural migrants. Similarly, only 9% of the&#13;
rural migrants were unemployed, while 21% of the urban migrants were unemployed.&#13;
But the percentage of skilled,-semi-skilled and unskilled migrants were similar for&#13;
both rural and urban origin.&#13;

3.18      The distribution of migrants by present occupation (Table 3.5) reveals&#13;
that skilled workers, technical hands, and professionals constitute nearly 60%&#13;
of the workers. By comparing this with the previous occupation of the migrants&#13;
one might be tempted to conclude that when they return they will be more skilled&#13;
than they were before migration; and this addition to skill should be treated&#13;
as a benefit for the society.  But such a conclusion from the data presented in&#13;
Tables 3.4 and 3.5 would be unwarranted.  For it is possible that many of the&#13;
migrants who were either unemployed or employed .in an occupation requiring no&#13;
skills did. possess some skills which could not be utilized due to a lack of&#13;
proper job opportunities. These migrants now categorized. as skilled workers or&#13;
technical hands in Table 3.5 are Using skills which they already possessed before&#13;

they migratei½  Tf this is so, the contention that the migran-t workers are&#13;
acquiring more skills on their job may not be tenable. j&#13;
3.19      Distribution of migrant workers by country of emigration (Table 3.6)&#13;
slhows that there aIe a few countries which have attracted most of them.  For&#13;
example, there appears to be a concentration of urban workers in Libya (18.180%),&#13;
Saudi Arabia (16.88%), Oman (11.69%) and Iraq (10.39%).  On the other hand, more&#13;
rural migrants have gone to Abn. Dhabi (36.44%), (O1an (17.8(%) and Dubai (13.99%o).&#13;
On the whole, Abu Dhabi, Oman, Dubai ani3 Faudi Arabia have taken a total of two-&#13;
thirds of the migrants.      This pattern can be explained at least partly by the&#13;
type of workers migrating from Bangladesh on one hand and the leve' 7    develoi: rl. T&#13;
and the consequent pattern of economic activities in the receiving countries on&#13;
the other.  A look at Table 3.5 would indicate that a large number of migrants&#13;
from Bangladesh are workers for construction and infrastructure building -  both&#13;
skilled and unskilled.  Obviously, they are needed in large numbers in countries&#13;
which have only recently started their process of development. This clearly&#13;
explains the concentration of Bangladeshts export of manpower in countries like&#13;
UAE and Oman.&#13;

3.20      Table 3.7 shows that most of the migrants have migrated only recently;&#13;
less than one-fourth of them are staying abroad for more than two years.  It is&#13;
intereFting to note, however, that migration from urban areas started comparatively&#13;
later compared to migration from rural areas.  Only 5% of the urban migrants have&#13;
stayed abroad for more than two years compared to 38% in the case of rural migrants.&#13;
1_J Even in this case, one can argue that the job the migrant worker is doing must&#13;
be helping him to preserve the skill he already possessed; and this would not&#13;
have been possible in the absence of migration. If this is true, preserva-&#13;
tion of acquired skills should clearly be regarded as a benefit associated&#13;
with migration.&#13;

Method of Sending_Money&#13;
3.21      Table 3.8  indicates that only 50% of the migrants relied exclusively on&#13;
banks while another 9% used banks along with private channels.  As many as 35%&#13;
relied exclusively on private channels. These include a number of means ranging&#13;
from simple hundi to transfers through intermediaries who collect funds abroad to&#13;
make payments for imports under the Wage Earners Scheme. It is also interesting&#13;
to note that only a small percentage (nearly 4%) of urban migrants use these pri-&#13;
vate channels to send money to their families. An overwhelming majority of them&#13;
(more than 92%) use banks for this purpose.&#13;

3.22      Regarding the time taken by the remittance money to reach the receivers,&#13;
two questions may be asked. First, does the time vary with the method used? Second,&#13;
does it take a longer time for money to reach rural areas? Table 3.9 contains some&#13;
data which might answer these questions. It is seen that in 70% of the urban cases&#13;
using banks, the remittance money has reached the recipient in less than three weeks.&#13;
But in all the urban cases reporting the use of private channels the money reached the&#13;
recipient in less than two weeks. Similarly, the time lapse reported for the bank&#13;
method is less than three weeks in 61% of the rural cases.   For private channels, the&#13;
corresponding figure is 70%. Thus, it appears that in both rural and urban areas,&#13;
remittance money sent  through private channels reaches ,-he recipient more quickly.&#13;

The figure in each cell gives the number of migrant workers for which the relevant method of sending money and the time lapse reported&#13;
are applicable. The figures within parentheses are percentages of the relevant row total. The total number is different from the&#13;
actual number of migrant workers. This is due to two reasons. First, a small number of households reported to have received no remit-&#13;
tance money during the year of reference. Second, some migrants are reported to have used both methods, and the time lapsesfor them&#13;
are shown separately.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Comparing urban and rural areas there is not much difference in the time required by&#13;
the remittan:e money to reach the recipients.  The time lapse reported is less than&#13;
three weeks in 67% of the rural cases and 71% of the urban cases.  On the other hand&#13;
the percentage of cases reporting six weeks and more is 7.41% ini the rural area and&#13;
2.66% in the urban area.  It is thus clear that although the difference does not&#13;
appear substantial, it does take some more time for the remittance money to reach&#13;
rural households.&#13;
Income and Assets&#13;
3.23      So far as income is concerned, it was expected that the level of income of&#13;
the remittance receiving households would be quite high. Difficulty was anticipated&#13;
in finding households not receiving remittance money (for sub-sample B) and yet&#13;
having an income roughly comparable to that of households which did. Nevertheless,&#13;
in urban areas the households interviewed for sub-sample B had levels of income&#13;
comparable to those of sub-sample A. For example, the average monthly household in-&#13;
come for these two samples are Tk. 3,386 and Tk. 5,354 respectively; the difference&#13;
is not statistically significant. But in rural areas the problem was greater despite&#13;
the fact that in most cases the family known to be the richest in the locality was&#13;
selected for sub-sample B. The averagq monthly household income for sub-samples&#13;
A and B are Tk. 5,201 and Tk. 2,685 respectively; the difference is statistically&#13;
significant. j&#13;
3.24      Hence, so far as these two sets of households in the rural areas are con-&#13;
cerned, a comparison between the composition of spending rather than the absolute&#13;
volumes of the expenditures would be more meaningful. If, however, it is found&#13;
that despite having a significantly higher level of income the level of aggregate&#13;
spending by the A households does not differ significantly from that of B households,&#13;
it will be possible to conclude that the former has a higher propensity to save&#13;
than the latter. Table 3.10 shows that the distribution of income for the sample&#13;
households is more unequal for the A households in both rural and arban areas.  For&#13;
-6xample, the bottom 40% of the A households in the rural area enjoy 15.45% of total&#13;
income while in the case of B households, the percentage of income enjoyed is 17.89%.&#13;
Similarly, for the urban area the two percentages are 14.37% and 19.73% respectively.&#13;
In the case of the distribution of owned land (Table 3.11) there is no such pattern.&#13;
It is more unequal for the A households in the rural area while the opposite is the&#13;
case for the urban area. It is also important to note that the distribution of&#13;
owned land in all cases is much more unequal compared to the distribution of income.&#13;
j   It may also be mentioned here that the average income of the sample households&#13;
in both rural and urban areas is much higher compared to the national averages.&#13;
According to the National Family Expenditure Survey of 1973-74, the average&#13;
household income in the rural and urban areas was Tk. 463.73 and Tk. 629.53&#13;
respectively.&#13;

Coming to the composition of income for the A households (Table 3.12) it can be&#13;
seen that foreign remittance is the major source of income for most of the sample&#13;
households. In fact, the share of remittance money in total income is more than&#13;
three-fourths for 62% of the rural and 47% of the urban households.&#13;

Quality of Housing&#13;
3.25      The main indicators of the quality of housing were the type of floor,&#13;
wall and roof of the living quarters, the sources of drinking water, fuel and&#13;
ligihting, and the type of toilet. Table 3.13 shows the percentage distribution-of&#13;
the sample households by type of floor, wall and roof. In each case there are three&#13;
categories of materials used for construction, starting with the best and most&#13;
expensive and arranging the others in order. For example, in the case of walls,&#13;
brick has been identified as the best material, tin and wood as the next best and&#13;
mud and bamboo as the lowest category.&#13;

3.26      Table 3.13 shows that the difference between the percentage of A and. B&#13;
households in various categories is not very high. And when there is a small dif-&#13;
ference, the percentage of A households is greater in the case of lower categories&#13;
and smaller in the case of higher categories.  For example, 61.19%o of the rural A&#13;
households have bamboo or mud walls compared to 58.21% of the B households.  9.21%&#13;
or the urban A households have this type of walls compared to 1.32%o of urban B&#13;
households. Again, the percentage of households having a pucca roof is smaller for&#13;
the A households in both rural and urban areas. Similar is the case with the per-&#13;
centage of households having a pucca floor. On the other hand, a larger percentage&#13;
of A households have a katcha floor than B households in both rural and urban areas.&#13;
It must, however, be mentioned that in most of the cases, the differences in the&#13;
percentages are small. The conclusion which follows is that the type of construc-&#13;
tion of the living quarters does not differ much between the two categories of&#13;
households under study.&#13;
3.27      The sources of water have also been classified from the best and. most&#13;
desirable (running tap water within the premises) to the least desirable (ponds,&#13;
canals, rivers, etc.).  Table 3-14 gives the percentage distribution of households&#13;
for various sources of drinking water. Here again, the difference between the A&#13;
and B households does not appear to be remarkable. It can, therefore, be oncluded&#13;
that these two types of households get drinking water from similar sources.&#13;

3.28      Similarly, the types of toilet have been classified from the best (sani-&#13;
tary for the household only) to the worst (katcha for common use).  Here again, it&#13;
is interesting to note that a larger percentage of A households in both rural and&#13;
urban areas have the less desirable types of toilets (katcha either for common use&#13;
or for the household only; see Table 3.15).&#13;

3.29      Table 3.16 gives the distribution of sample households by type of fuel&#13;
used for cooking and sources of lighting.  In the former case, there is practically&#13;
no difference between the A and B households in rural areas.  In the urbari area,&#13;
however, a smaller percentage of A households use gas and kerosene while a larger&#13;
percentage use wood and kerosene compared to the B households.  It is also inter-&#13;
esting to note that a small percentage of rural households get light from electricity,&#13;
but the percentage is higher for the A households. In urban areas, however, a smal-&#13;
ler percentage of A households have electricity and a larger percentage of them use&#13;
kerosene for lighting.&#13;

3.30     Trhe evidence presented above should dispel any presumptions about dif-&#13;
ferences in the quality of housing between remittance receiving households and those&#13;
receiving no remittance money. Even in rural areas where the average household in-&#13;
come is signaificantly higher for the former category, the quality of housing does&#13;
not differ much between the two categories of households.  This, however, should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
not lead. one to presume that they spend. similar amovuats on the construction, repair&#13;
and maintenance of housing,      In fact, as will be seen later, the remittance&#13;
receiving households actually spend more on new constru(:tion.&#13;
D. 1jkaZt of Remittance Money on Levels and Composition of&#13;
Household. Expenditure&#13;
3.31      The 'impact of remittance money on household expenditure can be analysed&#13;
by answering several questions.  First, do the households which receive remittance&#13;
money have a propensity to spend moreov  3  ond., do these householdcs spend more on&#13;
luxury items rather than essential goods -ompared to those households which do not&#13;
receive any remittance money?  Third, do the remittance receiving household.s spend.&#13;
more on the pu.r hase of land and construction of houses compared to the other house-&#13;
holds?  Fourth, what is the attitude of these two types of households towards&#13;
productive investments in agriculture, ind.ustry and business?&#13;
3.32      As was alread.y seen, the average monthly household income of the remittance&#13;
receiving households is much higher than the national average.  The national family&#13;
expenditure survey af 1973-74 shows that 7.23% of the rural households and 15.24%&#13;
of urban households have a monthly ir_(ome of more than Tk. 1,000.  In contrast,&#13;
95.53% of the rural and 98.68% of the urban households receiving remittance morey&#13;
have a monthly income of more than Tk. 1,000. It is thus clear that these households&#13;
are in the top decile of the national income distribution. Since savings is sub-&#13;
optimal in the economy of Banglad.esh, the application of distributional weight would&#13;
imply the use of progressively smaller social weights for consumption by the upper&#13;
income groups. Hence, the so(ial value of consumption by the sample households&#13;
must be smaller than its private value. Moreover, if these households spend more&#13;
on luxury items and consumer d.urables compared-to-their counterparts whi h do not&#13;
receive remittane money, the social value of such expenditures would be even l ess&#13;
than their private value.  Similarly, the social value of expenditures on the pur-&#13;
chase of land, construction of houses, etc. should also be less than their private&#13;
value. A-,l ,-I -t s important to see whether the A households spenid more on these than&#13;
the B households.  All these ana.yses hate important implications for a cost-&#13;
benefit evaluation of the export of manpower.&#13;
3.33      Table 3.17 shows the monthly average expenditure per household of the sam-&#13;
ple&lt;household.s.  This is shown separately for the monthly household expenditure&#13;
groups as well as for all groups taken together. The distribution of total ex-&#13;
penditure between consumption, tax payments, interest payments, payments to members&#13;
l_ving away, and gifts and. d.onations is also shown in the Table.  It is seen that&#13;
the total nonthly expenditure by the rural A households (Tk. 2,678.83) exceeds that&#13;
of the rural B households^ (Tk. 2,036) by only a small amount. A test for the equality&#13;
of means shows that this difference is not statistically significant.  And the total&#13;
monthly expenditure of the urban A households (Tk. 3,250.68) is almost equal to that&#13;
of the urban B householdls (Taka 3,250.28). A test for the equality of means could&#13;
not reject the null hypothesis that average expenditures of these two sets of house-&#13;
holds are equal.  Thas the hypothesis that the aggregate expenditure of households&#13;
receiving remittance money is different from (and probably higher than) that of&#13;
the other households does not seem to be true. Moreover, if it is remembered that&#13;

the average income of the raw al A households is significantly higher than that of&#13;
the B households, the equality of aggregate expenditure of these two types of house-&#13;
holds implies that the former (i.e., those which receive remittance money) save more&#13;
than the latter.  A comparison of savings calbulated from the data also corroborates&#13;
this (see Table 3.18).  The remittance re!eiving households, on an average, save&#13;
significantly higher amounts than the other households in both rural and urban areas.&#13;
The proportion of income saved by the remittance re eivers is also significantly&#13;
higher. In the rural area, for example, these households saved as much as 5010 of&#13;
their income compared to only 1.18% in the case of those who do not receive remittance&#13;
money. Similarly, the remittance receiving households in the urban area saved 39.21%&#13;
of their income compared to 4.2010 saved by the other households.  Table 3.18 shows&#13;
that these conclusions hold for households in the various income groups as well,&#13;
especially in the rural area.  The ura2. A 2ci;seholds in all income groups save&#13;
more (or dissave less) compared to the B households.  For urban households, this con-&#13;
clusion does not apply for only two income groups.  But in general, it can lce&#13;
-'qd:lE savings ratio as well as the average absolute amount is higher for t1he&#13;
remittance receiving households at various levels of income.&#13;

3.34      Among the components of total expenditure, amounts spent by the rural A&#13;
households are higher than that of the rural B households in the case of consumption,&#13;
interest payments and gifts and donations.  On the other hand, B households, on an&#13;
average, spent more than the A households on taxes.  But in none of the cases are&#13;
the differences statistically significant. In the urban area, A households spent&#13;
more on consumption and gifts and donations while the B households spert more on&#13;
taxes and. interest payments. Here again, a test for the equality of means shows n,o&#13;
significant difference in either of the cases. Thus, so far as the composition of&#13;
spending between these broad items are concerned, the hypothesis that the spending&#13;
plic- ern of the two types of households under study is different does not seem to be&#13;
true.  This is also clear from the percentage distribution of total expenditure&#13;
between these broad components for the two categories of households.&#13;

3.35      Now the consumption expenditure will be examined in more detail to see&#13;
whether the composition is different for the two sets of households. Table 3.19&#13;
gives the division of consumption expenditure between food. caid drinks, clothing&#13;
and footwear, personal effects, house rent and repairs, fuel and lighting, furni-&#13;
ture and others. On an average, the rural A household.s spend more than the B&#13;
households on items except food and drinks and f uel and lighting. The difference&#13;
is statistically significant in the case of house rent and furniture. The urban A&#13;
households spend more on items except clothing and footwear, persoral effects&#13;
and funi*Loe_  7Tiz* difference, however, is statistically significant only in the&#13;
case of fuel and lighting. Thus it appears that there is some difference in the&#13;
composition of consumption expenditure of the households receiving remittance money&#13;
and those not receiving any. But this does not yet reveal whether the remittance&#13;
receiving households spend D-ore on luxury items, for many such items have been&#13;
included in the category called totherst in Table 3.19. Therefore, some items were&#13;
isolated from this category and the expenditure on these items by the sample house-&#13;
holds was examined. These items are: domestic servants, recreation and festivals&#13;
(see Table'3.20).  The difference in expenditure is statistically significant&#13;
only for the amounxt spent on recreation by the rural households; and in this case&#13;
tle :remittance receiving households are seen to spend more.  The other households&#13;
spend more on domestic servants in both rural and urban areas; but the difference&#13;
is not statistically significant in,either of the cases.  Thus, the hypothesis&#13;
that the remittance receiving households spend more on luxury items compared to&#13;
other households does not seem to get much support.&#13;
3.36      The composition of  the expenditure on iLood items was also looked at to&#13;
see whether the remittance receiving households spend more on less essential items.&#13;
Table 3.21 shows that these households in the rural area spend more than other&#13;
households only on some items:' other cereals, meat and sweets, biscuits, etc.&#13;
Of these, the last two items can be  alled less essential, but the difference is&#13;
not statistically significant in either of the items. The B households spend more&#13;
on the other items; but the difference is statistically significant only in the&#13;
case of sugar and tobacco.&#13;
3.37      On the other hand, the A households in the urban area spend more on items&#13;
like rices wheat, pulses, edible oils, meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, sugar, Z,&#13;
tea and coffee, and pan.  Of these, meat, fruits, sugar, tea and coffee, and pan can&#13;
be treated as less essential items. , but the difference in average expenditure is&#13;
not statistically significant in either of the eases.&#13;
3.38      From the above evidence it follows that there is no systematic tendency&#13;
on the part of the remittance rece" ing households to spend more c:n less essential&#13;
items compared to other households.  The other households also spend more than the&#13;
remittance receiving households on some of the less essential items. It ist howeverI&#13;
tot difficult to provide an explanation for the absence of a systematic difference&#13;
in the level and pattern of expenditure between the two sets of households.  It is&#13;
possible that households which are now receiving remittance money had in the past&#13;
a lower level of income compared to other households. And with an increase in the&#13;
level of income, the former group of households just started to emulate the level&#13;
and pattern of expenditure of the latter group. If this is true, then there would&#13;
be very little reason to find a systematic difference in the expenditure patter:3. of&#13;
the two types of households. This, of course, should not be taken to imply that&#13;
remittance money did not liave any impact on the expenditure pattern of the receiving&#13;
&#13;

households. On the contraryj it must have induced the receiving households to&#13;
increase their expenditure and emulate the spending pattern of those households&#13;
which already had similar levels of income.&#13;
3.39      Table 3.22 shows the number of households purchasing various types of&#13;
consumer durables and amnount spent per household on the items during 1974-75 and&#13;
1978-79. In the rural areas, a larger number of A households purchased radio-&#13;
recorders, televisions and refrigerators while in the urban area a larger number&#13;
of these households purchased radio-recorders, watches and clocks, and refrigerators.&#13;
However, A households in the rural area spent more on radios, radio-recorders,&#13;
televisions, watches and clocks, bicycles and cars compared to the B households.&#13;
The difference is statistically significant only in the case of radios and watches&#13;
and clocks. On the other hand, A households in the urban area spent more on all&#13;
items except bicycles, motorcycles and cars. The difference is statistically&#13;
signifi6ant only in the case of radios. Thus it is seen that the remittance re-&#13;
ceiving households do spend more than other households on some consumer durables.&#13;

3.40      Another important hypothesis concerning the impact of remittance money&#13;
on expenditure patterns is that these households have a tendency to spend more on&#13;
the purchase of  land and the construction of houses.  Data needed to test this&#13;
hypothesis are presented in Tables 3.23 and 3.24.  Table 3.23 shows the number of&#13;
households who purchased land, amount of land purchased per household7 as well as&#13;
the amount spent per household on the purchase of land during 1974-75 to 1978-79&#13;
are higher for the remittance receiving households compared to the other house-&#13;
holds in the rural area. These differences are statistically significant. In&#13;
the urban area a larger number of 'remittance receiving households purchased land.&#13;
It is, however, interesting to note that although the amount of land purchased by&#13;
them was, on an average, smaller than other households, the amount spent by them&#13;
was higher. There can be several explanations for this. For example, it is&#13;
possible that they bought more urban land compared to other households; since land&#13;
in the urban area is much more expensive compared to that in the rural area, buying&#13;
more urban land can explain the higher amount spent despite a smaller amount of&#13;
land purchased. It is also possible that the remittance receiving households in&#13;
the urban area purchased better quality land which is also more expensive.&#13;

3.41      Similarly, more householdg of sub-sample A in both rural and urban areas&#13;
made investments in the construction of houses (see Table 3.24). The amount spent&#13;
by them during 1974-75 to 1978-79 was, on average, much higher than for households&#13;
which do not receive remittances, and the difference is statistically significant&#13;
for rural sub-samples. The amount spent by the rural A households for improvements&#13;
and repairs of houpes was also much higher than that spent by the rural B households;&#13;
the difference is statistically significant. The opposite, however, is true in the&#13;
urban area.&#13;

3.42      Finally, the hypothesis that the remittance receiving households care&#13;
less about investments in directly productive activities like agriculture and in-&#13;
dustry remains to be examined. Table 3.25 provides the relevant data. In the rural&#13;
area the number of households which made some investment in agriculture does not&#13;
differ much between the two sub-samples. The amount invested per household is&#13;
only slightly higher for the A households, but this difference is not statistically&#13;
significant. Only one household from each of the sub-samples invested in industry,&#13;
and both of them reported an equal amount of investment. On the other hand, a much&#13;
larger number of B households reported investment in business although the amount&#13;
invested per household is higher in the case of A households. This difference is&#13;
not statistically significant. In the urban area, the amount invested in business&#13;
by the B households was, on the average, higher than that of the remittance receiving&#13;
households. The difference, however, is not significant. Only one household in&#13;
sub-sample A reported investment in industry, while none in sub-sample B reported&#13;
such investment. No household made any investment in agriculture.&#13;
3.43      Thus it is clear that the households receiving remittance money do not&#13;
invest more in productive activities like agriculture and industry. Even in business,&#13;
only the rural households receiving remittance money are reported to have made&#13;
more investments than the B households. But in the urban area, these households&#13;
have invested more than the A households. Thus it appears that remittance money&#13;
is not making any notable contribution towards creating opportunities for productive&#13;
employment within the economy.&#13;

E. Uses to Which the Remittance Money is Put by the Receiving Households&#13;
3.44      The questionnaire used for the survey was also designed to find out the&#13;
part of expenditures on various items financed from remittance money. It is true&#13;
that while making an expenditure one does not usually distinguish between sources&#13;
from which the income has come, but there are items (e.g. consumer durables, orna-&#13;
ments, land, houses, etc.) which are not usually purchased from current income and&#13;
which involve large expenditures. In such cases, the respondents could tell quite&#13;
easily how much of the total expenditure was financed from remittance money. More-&#13;
over, for many households, remittance money forms more than three-fourths of total&#13;
income; and for them it was not too difficult to identify the sources of finance&#13;
for consumer goods. But not all the respondents could give such a breakdown of&#13;
total expenditures, and some of them could do it for some items, while others did&#13;
it for different items. Nevertheless, the data was processed, and in doing so only&#13;
those schedules were used where such a breakdown is available. The following&#13;
analysis is based on this data.&#13;
3.45      First, it was seen how much of the remittance received by a household&#13;
during a year was used for meeting consumption expenditure in general and for the&#13;
consumption of food and clothing in particular; and second, how much of the yearly&#13;
remittance is used for festivals and ceremonies. The necessary data are presented&#13;
in Tables 3.26, 3.27 and 3.28. Table 3.26 indicates that on an average, the house-&#13;
holds spend less than half the remittance received during a year on consumption.&#13;
Even if it is assumed that some part of the remittance money is used for other&#13;
purposes like tax and interest payment, gifts, donations, etc., it is apparent that&#13;

savings out of the remittance received is quite high. And this is consistent with&#13;
the earlier finding that the remittance receiving households save significantly&#13;
higher amounts than other households at similar income levels. One interesting&#13;
fact is that the proportion of remittance money used for consumption varies inversely&#13;
with the level of income of the household. This implies that higher income households&#13;
save more from the remittance received. Moreover, the urban households use a&#13;
slightly lower proportion of the remittance money for consumption.  This is also&#13;
consistent with the fact that the remittance received by them is higher than that&#13;
received by the rural households.&#13;
3.47      How much of the remittance received is devoted to current expenditure can&#13;
also be ascertained in an alternative way. Since the income of a household is&#13;
known by sources, the non-remittance part of the income can be easily compared with&#13;
the total expenditure. If the total expenditure (E) exceeds non-remittance income&#13;
(NRI), the excess can be assumed to have been met from remittance income (RI). This&#13;
excess of expenditure over NRI as a percentage of RI can give an indication of the&#13;
part of RI used to meet current expenditure. Table 3.27 presents the relevant&#13;
data. It is clear that this excess represents 46.55% and 33.64% of the remittance&#13;
income respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that these households must have&#13;
spent 46.55% and 33.64% of their remittance income for meeting current expenditures.&#13;
These figures provide good support to the direct observations which show that urban&#13;
and rural households spend respectively 41.47% and 45.12% of their remittance income&#13;
to meet consumption needs. The closeness of these two sets of figures should in-&#13;
crease the reliability of the methodology of identifying the uses to which the&#13;
remittance money is put.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
3.48      Table 3.28 shows that nearly 20% of the remittance received during a&#13;
year is used for the purchase of food; and this proportion is almost equal for&#13;
both rural and urban households. Here again, the percentage of remittance money&#13;
spent on food varies inversely with the level of income.&#13;
3.49      A much smaller proportion (nearly 4%) of the remittance money is, however,&#13;
spent on clothing. This is also the same for both rural and urban households. It&#13;
is also interesting to note that the expenditure on clothing met from remittance&#13;
money is not systematically related to the level of income of the household (see&#13;
Table 3.29).&#13;

3.50      Similarly, the proportion spent on festivals and ceremonies does not vary&#13;
systematically with the level of income (see Table 3.30). But this proportion is&#13;
higher than that spent on clothing. Moreover, the rural households appear to&#13;
spent a much higher proportion (7.12%) compared to the urban ones (2.80%).&#13;
3.51      In order to see the proportion of remittance money used for the purchase&#13;
of consumer durables, land and ornaments, construction and improvement of houses,&#13;
repayment of debt and investment in agriculture, industry or business, the period of&#13;
reference was extended from one to five years. The amount spent during 1974-75&#13;
to 1978-79 for pqrposes mentioned above was compared with the amount of remittance&#13;
received during this period.&#13;
3.52      Table 3.31, for example, shows that nearly 4% of the remittance received&#13;
has been spent on consumer durables. This, however, differs. quite significantly&#13;
between the rural and urban households; the latter spent a much higher proportion&#13;
(9.43%) compared to the former (2.93%). But this proportion does not vary systema-&#13;
tically with the level of income, either in the rural or in the urban area.&#13;

3.53      The proportion of remittance money used for the purchase of land is,&#13;
however, quite high.  Table 3.32 indicates that nearly 29% of the remittances was&#13;
used for the purchase of land.  It is also clear that the rural households spent a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
much larger proportion compared to the urban. This is not entirely unexpected in&#13;
view of the fact that power and prestige in the rural area is much more associated&#13;
with the ownership of land compared to the urban area. Moreover, it is possible&#13;
that the attitude towards life and modern living changes at comparatively slower&#13;
pace in the rural area. And that is manifested in the lower proportion of remittance&#13;
money spent on modern consumer durables by the rural households. It is, therefore,&#13;
hardly surprising that the rural households use a much larger proportion of the&#13;
remittance money for the purchase of land.&#13;

3.54      But the proportion spent on construction and improvement of houses is&#13;
similar for both rural and urban households (see Table 3.33). This can be ex-&#13;
plained by the fact that investment in housing in cities like Dacca and Chittagong&#13;
gives an attractive return. Moreover, this is considered to be one of the safest&#13;
areas where investment can be made. It should also be noted that quite a sub-&#13;
stantial proportion (one-fifth) of the remittance money is used for investment in&#13;
housing. Thus, even at the risk of stretching the data a little bit it might be&#13;
concluded that nearly half the remittance received is used for the purchase of&#13;
land and construction of houses.&#13;
3.55      Compared to this, a smaller proportion has been used for the purchase&#13;
of ornaments. While the rural households spent 4.25% of their remittance money&#13;
for this purpose, the urban households spent only 2.85%. And here again, the&#13;
proportion does not seem to vary systematically with income (see Table 3.34).&#13;

3.56      Table 3.35 indicates that it is only the rural households who made any&#13;
investments in agriculture out of the remittance money. The proportion used is&#13;
small and does not vary systematically with the level of income. The urban households&#13;
spent a substantial proportion (17.52%) of the remittances in business. Such&#13;
expenditure is small in the case of rural households. This again can be explained&#13;
easily by the fact that urban people with better access to the business world, better&#13;
knowledge and information, and possibly better education are in a more advantageous&#13;
position to gain from investments in business.&#13;
3.57      Finally, Table 3.36 indicates that a good proportion (17.03%) of the&#13;
remittance money is used for repayment of earlier debts. Here again, rural and&#13;
urban households do not demonstrate any significant difference. Although the ex-&#13;
penditure for debt repayment may at first appear to be somewhat inconsistent with&#13;
the level of income of the households, it is not difficult to find an explanation.&#13;
The explanation lies in the method of getting jobs in the Middle East countries.&#13;
Only in recent years some recruiting for such jobs has been done through BMET.&#13;
Before that the negotiations for jobs used to be carried out entirely by private&#13;
intermediaries in exchange for a fee which was usually fixed through bargaining.&#13;
Even now these private channels continue to exist. And the expenditure involved in&#13;
securing a job through them is quite high. The prospective migrants do not usually&#13;
hesitate to meet this expenditure by borrowing, for the expected return in terms&#13;
of income from jobs in the Middle East is also very high. Thus, it is not difficult&#13;
to explain the use of a part of the remittance money for debt repayments. It is&#13;
also interesting to note that the proportion of remittance money used for this&#13;
purpose varies inversely with the level of income.&#13;

3.58      The pattern of the use of remittance money that emerges from the above&#13;
findings can now be summarized. Since it is an important source of income for&#13;
many households, they do use a substantial part of it for current consumption.&#13;
But the level of savings out of such money, especially for the high income house-&#13;
holds, is also quite high. The use of these savings for directly productive&#13;
activities like agriculture and industry is, however, rather limited. Most of&#13;
the accumulated savings are used for the purchase of land and the construction and&#13;
improvement of houses. A good part is also used for the repayment of earlier&#13;
debts.&#13;
3.59      Although the economy of Bangladesh suffers from a suboptimality of savings,&#13;
the savings out of remittance money are not going to have a high social value&#13;
unless they can be directed towards productive purposes. This prompted the exam-&#13;
ination of the attitude of the sample households towards using their savings for&#13;
such purposes. When asked whether they would be interested in making investments&#13;
for productive purposes (e.g., setting up a small manufacturing unit, purchasing&#13;
a tubewell and leasing it out to farmers, purchasing transport equipment and&#13;
leasing it) only 38% of the rural households and 11% of the urban households re-&#13;
plied in the affirmative (see Table 3.37). They were also asked whether they&#13;
would be interested in making such investments if the Government provided special&#13;
encouragement in the form of tax exemptions, loans at a low rate of interest, etc.&#13;
Even then, the percentage of households showing a positive attitude increased only&#13;
to 44% in the case of rural households and 14% in the case of urban households.&#13;
Thus it is evident that not even half the sample households are interested in using&#13;
their savings in a manner which would increase their social value.&#13;

SAVINGS FOR PRODUCTIVE PURPOSES&#13;

Urban Sub-sample B.               10.53                           15.79&#13;
3.60      It is also interesting to note that a larger percentage of the house-&#13;
holds not receiving remittance money showed positive attitudes towards such in-&#13;
vestments compared to the remittance receiving households (see Table 3.37). One&#13;
can therefore conclude that the social value of savings in the hands of these two&#13;
types of households are likely to be different. In fact, savings generated by&#13;
the remittance receiving households should be attached a lower social value than&#13;
that of other households. This conclusion gets support from the earlier findings&#13;
that those receiving remittances spend significantly higher amounts on the purchase&#13;
of land and construction of houses, and lower amounts for productive purposes&#13;
compared to those not receiving such money.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

F. Some Concluding Observations&#13;
3.61      Migration of workers from Bangladesh to the Middle East is a relatively&#13;
recent phenomenon. While this is being looked at both as a means of providing&#13;
employment opportunities for the Bangladeshi workers and as a source of valuable&#13;
foreign exchange for the country, the profile of the migrants indicates that this&#13;
was at a significant cost for the economy in terms of the adverse effect on pro-&#13;
duction as well as the costs of education and training of the migrant workers.&#13;
3.62      The remittance money must have raised the income level of the receiving&#13;
households significantly, for it is seen that the average income of such house-&#13;
holds is much higher than that of households in the top decile of the national&#13;
income distribution. But the data do not enable conclusions to be drawn regarding&#13;
the impact of remittance money on the distribution of income. It is, however,&#13;
possible to build up a preliminary hypothesis on the basis of some indirect evidence&#13;
such as the previous occupation of the migrant worker, income earned by other&#13;
members of the family, and so on. It appears that most of the households from which&#13;
workers emigrated were possibly in the middle or upper middle income groups. Some&#13;
of them could be in the lower middle income group as well, but it is difficult to&#13;
find workers migrating from the poorest or low income households. One conclusion&#13;
(which, of course, is very tentative) that emerges from the above is this. Re-&#13;
mittance money is helping households in the lower middle, middle and upper middle&#13;
income groups to move upwards in the income scale. The poorer households do not&#13;
seem to have benefitted much from the migration of workers that is taking place&#13;
and the consequent inflow of remittance money.&#13;
3.63      As to the impact of remittance money on household expenditure, it was&#13;
seen that the usual hypothesis about the remittance receiving households having a&#13;
greater propensity to spend cannot be supported by the data. In fact, the propen-&#13;
sity to save is much higher for these housholds compared to those which do not re-&#13;
ceive remittance money. An examination of the composition of spending shows that&#13;
there is no systematic difference between the pattern of spending of the two types&#13;
of households. The hypothesis that the remittance receiving households have a&#13;
propensity to spend more on less essential and luxury items does not get much support&#13;
from the data. However, they are found to spend more on some consumer durables.&#13;
3.64      On the other hand, the remittance receivers are found to spend higher&#13;
amounts for the purchase of land and the construction of houses. So far as expen-&#13;
diture on productive activities like agriculture, industry and business is concerned,&#13;
the difference between the two types of households does not appear significant.&#13;
A look at the use of the remittance money itself reveals that nearly half of it is&#13;
spent for the purchase of land and the construction, repair and improvement of&#13;
houses. A substantial part of it is also used for the repayment of earlier debts.&#13;
Very little, however, is invested in activities like agriculture, industry or&#13;
business. It is clear, therefore, that the remittance received by the households&#13;
contributes very little (at least directly) towards the creation of productive&#13;
employment opportunities.&#13;
3.65      Another conclusion which emerges from the above findings is this.  Al-&#13;
though the remittance receiving households have a propensity to save more, the&#13;
accumulated savings is being used mostly for the purchase of consumer durables,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
construction of houses, speculation in raal estate, etc. Not much of the savings&#13;
is invested in directly productive activities. Nor did the attitude of the remit-&#13;
tance receiving households towards such investments appear particularly encouraging.&#13;
Hence, the social value attached to their savings should be lower than that of&#13;
the savings of other households.&#13;

CHAPTER IV&#13;
COST OF TRAINING OF BANGLADESH MIGRANTS TO THE MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
4.1       There has been a rapid increase of migrants in recent years from Bangladesh&#13;
to the Middle East. Remittances from migrants have greatly boosted the volume of&#13;
foreign exchange earning of the Government and there is a conscious effort to increase&#13;
the manpower export to increase foreign exchange earning. No attempt has so far&#13;
been made to analyse the cost of training of manpower to assess the cost per unit&#13;
of export earning. The present study is therefore directed toward determining the&#13;
capital and current cost of (a) training prospective migrants and their replacements,&#13;
and (b) the employment exchange program.&#13;
4.2       Information on costs of education and training can be obtained from&#13;
universities and other educational and training institutions, and from Government&#13;
departments. Similarly, cost of the employment exchange program is available at&#13;
BMET and other organisations dealing with migrants. For the purpose of this study,&#13;
it was decided to use the same 10% sample drawn for the study on the profile of&#13;
current and prospective migrants in Chapter I to prepare an occupational file of&#13;
migrants, spell out the training background of the migrants, and identify the&#13;
training institutions of the migrants.&#13;
4.3       Occupational file.  Around 3,500 sample cards held at BMET were reproduced&#13;
for use. Each card was then checked and verified to identify the occupation of&#13;
the migrants. In all 350 occupations were identified.&#13;
4.4       Training background.  For the purpose of the study all 350 occupations&#13;
were classified into five major occupational groups according to the level of&#13;
education and degree of professional skills. The groups are:&#13;
(a) Professional&#13;
(b) Technical&#13;
(c) Skilled&#13;
(d) Semi-skilled&#13;
(e) Unskilled&#13;
A brief definition of each of them is given below.&#13;
(a) Professional. This group consists of people having graduate or&#13;
higher educational training and axe capable of carrying out professional&#13;
duties. (Professors, graduate teachers, graduate engineers, medical&#13;
doctors, agricultural specialists, scientists, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
(b)  Technical.  This group is comprised of diploma engineers, para-&#13;
medics, nurses, etc. The academic level is below Bachelor's&#13;
Degree and it was assumed that in some cases people in this group&#13;
go to school for a couple of years after passing HSC examinations&#13;
and in other cases after passing SSC examinations.&#13;
(c) Skilled. This group consists of people like mechanics, carpenters,&#13;
foremen, blacksmiths, caterers, masons, etc. The academic level&#13;
is below HSC and it was felt that some workers in this group go&#13;
to school for some time after passing the SSC examinations. In&#13;
many institutions the requirement is below SSC level. Certain&#13;
workers who did not have formal training as mentioned above but&#13;
had 10 years of employment experience were also included in this&#13;
group.&#13;
(d)  Semi-skilled.  This group consists of people like book binders,&#13;
bakers, dyers, drillers, gardeners, ironmen, khalashis, etc. and&#13;
assistants to skilled workers mentioned in group (c) above.&#13;
Workers in this group were assumed to have primary level educa-&#13;
tion and five years of job experience.&#13;
(e) Unskilled. Workers in this group were assumed not to have any&#13;
formal education of institutional training. To name a few, the&#13;
group is comprised of ayahs, agricultural labourers, barbers,&#13;
house boys and room boys, etc. and assistants to skilled workers&#13;
mentioned in group (c) above.&#13;
4.5       Training Institutions.  All different kinds of migrants were classified&#13;
into five broad occupational groups. Each group contains people with different&#13;
educational and training backgrounds. Since the objective of the study was to&#13;
estimate the average cost of training of a person belonging to each profession,&#13;
the next step was to identify the various training institutions, if any, where&#13;
these professionals were trained.&#13;

Design of the Study&#13;
4.6       Since information on costs was obtained from a number of educational and&#13;
training institutes, and other organisations, it was decided that wherever possible&#13;
probability sampling techniques would be followed in selecting the institutions and&#13;
organisations and suitable questionnaires would be developed for collecting rele-&#13;
vant information.&#13;
4.7       Sampling Area.  Various training institutions were identified against&#13;
different groups of professionals. It will appear that the study area was spread&#13;
over the whole of Bangladesh.&#13;
4.8       Sampling Frame.  Generally, there are two different types of educational&#13;
institutions in the country -- public and private. Public institutions are completely&#13;
financed by the Government. For this study it was decided to determine the cost&#13;
to the Government of training a migrant. As a result different public institutions&#13;
relevant for this purpose were studied. A full listing of the institutions (as of&#13;
1978) formed the sampling frame. Eigiteen such frames, one for each type of in-&#13;
stitution, were prepared. Table 4.2 shows the different categories of institutions&#13;
with their numbers.&#13;
4.9       Sample Size.  A list of various institutions sampled is also given in Table&#13;
4.2. The size of the sample varies from institution to institution depending on the&#13;
size of the population.&#13;

4.10      Sampling Procedure.  When there were more than two units in the frame,&#13;
sampling unilts were selected on the basis of probability sampling techniques.&#13;
For units numbering two or less, the entire population was taken. To estimate&#13;
costs of primary and higher secondary education, secondary sources of information&#13;
rather than primary sources were used. This was done because it appeared too time-&#13;
consuming to handle a large size population.&#13;
4.11      Questionnaire. Detailed questionnaires to estimate the current (or recur-&#13;
ring) cost of training migrants, about the employment exchange program, and to es-&#13;
timate capital for both categories were prepared to cover more or less all relevant&#13;
items of expenditure.&#13;
4.12      Data Collection and Processing.  One research officer and one research&#13;
assistant helped the project leader plan the study and analyze the data, design&#13;
the questionnaires, and train the field staff. Before the start of actual field&#13;
work, the investigators were trained to make sampling frames, do pretesting of&#13;
questionnaires, locate sampling units, and collect data. Three field investigators&#13;
were enployed and trained and then moved to their respective areas to identify&#13;
sampling units and collect data. The field work was over in September 1979. Com-&#13;
pleted questionnaires and other relevant data were brought to the Institute of&#13;
Statistical Research and Training during the first week of October 1979. These&#13;
were then edited and checked for processing and tabulation in the second and third&#13;
weeks of October. Tabulation and analysis of the data were done in the fourth&#13;
week of October and the first week of November.&#13;

B. Annual Average Recurring Cost of Training Migrants&#13;
(i) Professionals&#13;
4.13      Here an attempt is made to describe the results of estimation of recurring&#13;
costs of training professionals. Estimation of capital cost is described later.&#13;
It was initially contemplated that average cost of training a migrant belonging to&#13;
each professional group should be obtained. Since a particular group includes&#13;
people coming out of different educational and training institutes and thereby&#13;
incurring different costs it appeared unrealistic to calculate an average, even&#13;
weighted, cost estimation. It was therefore decided to give separate results of&#13;
estimation of cost for the different institutions belonging to a particular group.&#13;
4.14      There may be two types of average recurring costs -- (a) recurring cost&#13;
per student enrolled and (b) recurring cost of producing a student. Therefore,&#13;
the results of both have been obtained. As mentioned earlier, lists of different&#13;
institutions with their numbers as of 1978 were prepared. For output and enrolment&#13;
of students, the number of students produced in 1978 and the total enrolment in&#13;
various classes in 1978-79 respectively were taken. For total recurring expenditure&#13;
the reference period was the fiscal year 1978-79.&#13;
4.15      To estimate annual average recurring cost per student enrolled, the total&#13;
recurring cost per student enrolled, the total recurring expenditure for 1978-79&#13;
was divided by the total number of students enrolled in different classes in an&#13;
institution in the same year. The expression 'different classes' refers to the&#13;
various levels and years of schooling in an institution. For example, in the year&#13;
1978-79 the total number of students enrolled in a medical college would be the total&#13;
number in the first year class, second year class, third year class, fourth year&#13;
class, and final year class. In other words, total recurring amount was assumed to&#13;
have been spent on students of all the five classes.&#13;
4.16      While calculating the recurring cost per student produced, it was assumed&#13;
that the entire amount of the recurring expenditure in 1978-79 in all different&#13;
classes was spent for the students produced. Therefore, in order to obtain the yearly&#13;
average recurring cost per student produced, the total recurring expenditure was&#13;
divided by the total number of students produced -- the total being obtained by&#13;
multiplying the number of students produced in a year by its proper weight, i.e.,&#13;
years of schooling.&#13;
4.17      Brief descriptions of the results of estimation of annual average recurring&#13;
costs of the training of different professionals are given below. In Table 4.3&#13;
the list of the various institutions sampled in the professional group are presented.&#13;
Number of students enrolled and passed in these institutions, and the teacher-&#13;
student ratio are given in Table 4.4. Summary results of cost estimation can be&#13;
seen in Table 4.5 while Table 4.6 gives the annual average recurring cost of dif-&#13;
ferent levels of expenditure per student.&#13;

(a) Degree Colleges. There were 35 Government degree colleges in Bangladesh&#13;
in 1978. Four of these, Government Jagannath College, Government&#13;
Kushtia College, Government B.M. College, and Government Eden Girls'&#13;
College were studied to estimate average recurring cost per student&#13;
in a year. Estimated annual average recurring cost per student enrolled&#13;
was Tk. 759, and for student produced Tk. 2,315.&#13;
(b) Teachers' Training Colleges. Out of six teachers' training colleges&#13;
a sample of three, Dacca, Mymensingh and Comilla, were taken. Estimated&#13;
average annual recurring cost per student enrolled was found to be&#13;
Tk. 2,461 and per student produced Tk. 2,719.&#13;
(c)  Agriculture College.   There is only one agriculture college.  Average&#13;
annual recurring cost per student enrolled was estimated at Tk. 10,850&#13;
in 1978-79 and Tk 37,846 per student produced.&#13;
(d) Medical Colleges. Three out of a total of 10 medical colleges were&#13;
sampled -- Dacca Medical College, Mymensingh Medical College and Rajshahi&#13;
Medical College. Average annual recurring cost per student enrolled was&#13;
found to be Tk. 3,520 and per student produced Tk. 5,460.&#13;
(e) Engineering Colleges. Two out of a total of three engineering colleges&#13;
were surveyed -- Chittagong Engineering College and Khulna Engineering&#13;
College. Annual average recurring cost per student enrolled was esti-&#13;
mated to be Tk. 4,910 and per student produced Tk. 8,032.&#13;
(f) Agricultural University. For the purpose of this study relevant information&#13;
was sought from the only agricultural university in Bangladesh located&#13;
in Mymensingh. Annual average recurring costs per student enrolled and&#13;
student produced were estimated at Tk. 13,091 and Tk. 27,856 respectively.&#13;
(g) Engineering University. There is only one engineering university located&#13;
in Dacca. Annual average recurring cost per student enrolled was found&#13;
to be Tk. 7,782 and per student produced Tk. 16,176.&#13;
(h) Universities (General). Two of the four general universities in Bangladesh&#13;
in 1978 were surveyed -- Dacca University and Rajshahi University. Annual&#13;
average recurring cost was estimated at Tk. 3,120 per student enrolled&#13;
and Tk. 5,325 per student produced.&#13;

(a)  Intermediate Colleges.  A sample of two from a total of five Government&#13;
intermediate colleges was taken. The colleges are -- Kabi Nazrul College&#13;
in Dacca and Intermediate Government College in Chittagong. Annual&#13;
average recurring cost per student enrolled was estimated at Tk. 754 and&#13;
per student produced Tk. 1,311.&#13;
(b) Polytechnic Institutes. There were 17 polytechnic institutes in Bangladesh&#13;
in 1978 out of which a sample of four was taken. Estimated annual average&#13;
recurring cost per student enrolled was found to be Tk. 2,262 and per&#13;
student produced Tk. 4,365.&#13;
(c) Nurses' Training Centres. The total number of nurses' training centres&#13;
studied was three out of a total of 17. The sample centres are attached&#13;
to the medical college at Dacca, Sylhet, and Chittagong. Annual average&#13;
recurring cost per student enrolled was found to be Tk. 1,911 and per&#13;
student produced Tk. 2,867.&#13;
(d) Paramedical Institutes. There were two paramedical institutes in Bangla-&#13;
desh at the time of the study and both were surveyed.  The institutes&#13;
are situated at Dacca and Rajshahi. Annual average recurring cost per&#13;
student enrolled in these institutes was found to be Tk. 3,221 and per&#13;
student produced Tk. 3,396.&#13;
(iii) Skilled Workers&#13;
4.19      As mentioned earlier, some students in this group are trained in different&#13;
institutions after passing SSC examinations. For this reason separate calculations&#13;
have been made for annual average recurring cost incurred by the Government for&#13;
higher secondary education and instead of a sample study, secondary information was&#13;
used. It was mentioned before that many of the students go to specialized institu-&#13;
tions for training in different skills before passing SSC examinations. In this&#13;
case data was collected from different institutions to find out annual average&#13;
recurring expenditure spent on a student by these institutions. The results of&#13;
the estimation of cost per student in the above institutions are given. For some&#13;
institutions, where the nature of;training may not be obvious, a brief description&#13;
of the programme of the institutions is given.&#13;
4.20      In Table 4.11 the names of various institutions studied in the skilled&#13;
workers group are mentioned. Table 4.12 gives the number of students enrolled in&#13;
and produced by these institutions, and the teacher-student ratio. Table 4.13&#13;
gives the summary estimation of recurring cost per student while estimated annual&#13;
average recurring costs of various levels of expenditure can be seen in Table 4.14.&#13;
(a)  Secondary Schools.  As mentioned earlier, secondary sources of infor-&#13;
mation provided an estimated annual average recurring cost per student&#13;
for secondary education. Relevant data were obtained from Bangladesh&#13;
Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics, Ministry of Finance,&#13;
and Directorate of Public Instructions. In 1978-79 the total number&#13;
of Government high schools was 152 with 106,834 students enrolled.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -&#13;
The total number of students produced from these schools in 1978-79&#13;
was estimated at 9,698. There were 3,710 teachers and the total&#13;
recurring expenditure was Tk. 45,865,000. Annual average recurring&#13;
expenditure per student enrolled was found to be Tk. 429 and per&#13;
student produced Tk. 591.&#13;
(b)  Vocational Training Institutes.  Out of 39 vocational training insti-&#13;
tutes a sample of four located at Jessore, Brahmanbaria (Comilla),&#13;
Chandpur (Comilla) and Rangpur was drawn. Annual average recurring&#13;
cost per student enrolled in these institutes was estimated at Tk. 1,532&#13;
and per student produced Tk. 2,989.&#13;
(c)  Technical Training Centres.  There were four technical training centres&#13;
in Bangladesh at the time of the study and a sample of two was taken.&#13;
The centres are -- Technical Training Centre and Bangladesh-German&#13;
Technical Training Centre, both located at Mirpur (Dacca). The train-&#13;
ing is in the fields of draftsmanship, auto diesel, electricity,&#13;
refrigeration and air conditioning. Annual average recurring expen-&#13;
ditures per student enrolled and produced were estimated at Tk. 1,690&#13;
and Tk. 1,994 respectively.&#13;
(d)  Marine Diesel Training Centre.   Relevant information was obtained from&#13;
the only marine diesel training centre at Narayanganj. The centre has a&#13;
few trade courses of two years duration: ship-building welding, ship-&#13;
building draftsmanship, etc. Diploma in marine engineering is also&#13;
awarded there. Estimated annual average recurring expenditures per&#13;
enrolment in and output of the centre were estimated at Tk. 7,482 and&#13;
Tk. 9,564 respectively.&#13;
(e) Power Development Board Training Centres. At the time of the study there&#13;
were eight training centres under the Directorate of Training, Power&#13;
Development Board and the training institute at Tongi was surveyed. Two&#13;
kinds of training were conducted here during 1978-79 -- one in-service&#13;
and the other apprenticeship, There were 14 different courses of in-&#13;
service training each approximately six weeks long. The total number of&#13;
yearly enrolment was 388. In other words there were approximately 49&#13;
in-service trainees throughout the year. 72 trainees received apprentice-&#13;
ship training during 1978-79 and the total enrolment during the period&#13;
was 121. All of them successfully completed the training. The name of&#13;
the courses are: repair of distribution transformer, metering and&#13;
testing, etc. Annual average recurring expenditures per student enrolled&#13;
and student produced were Tk. 7,572.&#13;
(iv) Semi-skilled Workers&#13;
4.21      Workers like book binders, bakers, dyers, ironmen, etc. constitute the&#13;
group of semi-skilled workers. No formal technical training is undergone by these&#13;
workers. They could be independent workers or in some cases assistants to skilled&#13;
workers. The level of education of these workers may be assumed to be primary.&#13;
Thus, estimate of annual average recurring cost for primary education has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -&#13;
equated to that of semi-skilled workers. This is a rather arbitrary assumption.&#13;
The estimation procedure for obtaining Government annual expenditure per student&#13;
on primary education is explained below.&#13;
4.22      Primary Schools.  Here also, as in the case of secondary schools, secondary&#13;
sources of data obtained from Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and&#13;
Statistics., Directorate of Public Instructions, and Ministry of Finance were used.&#13;
There were 36,484 Government primary schools in Bangladesh during 1978. The total&#13;
number of teachers was 158,541 and there were 7,080,446 students enrolled. The&#13;
estimated number of students produced in 1978 was 1,197,891. Total recurring ex-&#13;
penditure (non-development, revised budget, 1978-79) was Tk. 833,865,000 of which&#13;
teachers' salaries was Tk. 571,223,000, allowances and honoraria were Tk. 194,642,000&#13;
and contingency was Tk. 68,000,000. Annual average recurring expenditure per&#13;
student enrolled is thus estimated at Tk. 118 and per student produced Tk. 139.&#13;
A summary of these results is given in Tables 4.15, 4.16 and 4.17.&#13;

C. Annual Average Recurring Cost of the Employment Exchange Programme&#13;
4.23      One of the objectives of the study is to determine the cost of the employ-&#13;
ment exchange programme. For this purpose, three different media were identified --&#13;
(a) Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training, (b) Recruiting Agents, and (c) indi-&#13;
vidual efforts. Chapter I already elaborated on the method of operations of these&#13;
media, their advantages and disadvantages, and also annual breakdown from January&#13;
1976 to July 1979 of the total number of migrants these various media handled.&#13;
As a result, descriptions of the working procedures of these media will be omitted.&#13;
4.24      To arrive at a unit cost for the employment exchange programme it was&#13;
imperative to study the three different media. It should be mentioned that indi-&#13;
vidual migrants could not be contacted. This did not, however, create any problem&#13;
since every individual, after obtaining a job abroad, must have processed his case&#13;
through BMET and, therefore, cost of employment abroad in this case is included in&#13;
that of BMET.  For the other two media, BMET and recruiting agents, frames were&#13;
developed for different offices of BMET (headquarters and ten employment exchange&#13;
offices in the country having foreign employment sections) and Government authorized&#13;
recruiting agents (around 200) as of 1978.&#13;
4.25      A sample size of 25 of the recruiting agents was taken.  Of them, seven&#13;
could not be located at their addresses and ten did not send any migrants. Infor-&#13;
mation from eight agents could be obtained. Observations were that they had other&#13;
jobs to perform and would not give data properly. Six of the agents mentioned&#13;
that they realized exorbitant fees from migrants. Recurring cost per migrant ranged&#13;
between Tk. 1,104 and Tk. 11,630 (this excludes fees realized). This cost is many&#13;
times higher than that incurred by BMET.  It has been tempting not to rely on their&#13;
data. Here again, the problem is handled in the same way as for individual migrants.&#13;
After selecting people for employment abroad, the agents process their cases through&#13;
BMET and as a result cost of the recruiting agents is included in the cost of the&#13;
employment exchange programme of BMET. The procedure for estimating cost was to&#13;
assess the same from BMET.&#13;
4.26      Information was obtained on different kinds of recurring costs for the&#13;
year 1978-79 of the foreign employment sections of BMET and ten employment exchanges&#13;
in Bangladesh. The items of information were on salary of administrative and other&#13;
staff, allowances and honoraria, and miscellaneous expenses including cost of&#13;
entertaining visiting employers. As can be seen in Table 4.18 the total number&#13;
of migrants handled by BMET (including recruiting agents and individual efforts)&#13;
in the year 1978 is 22,809 and dividing the total recurring expenditure, which&#13;
was found to be Tk. 744,306 for the year 1978-79, by this number the annual average&#13;
recurring cost per migrant of the employment exchange programme is estimated at&#13;
Tk. 32. Details of the results are given in tabular form in Table 4.19.&#13;

D. Annual Average Capital Cost of Migrants and of&#13;
the Employment Exchange Programme&#13;
4.27      There may be several ways of estimating capital cost.  In this study the&#13;
method followed was to find out from various institutions of the present total market&#13;
value of the fixed assets. Then, as in the case of total recurring costs, the total&#13;
capital cost so obtained was divided by the number of currently enrolled students&#13;
to arrive at the average capital cost per student enrolled, and by the number of&#13;
total output to arrive at the average capital cost per student produced. While&#13;
the average capital cost per student enrolled may be thought of as a measure of the&#13;
capital investment required to create an additional capacity, the same for a student&#13;
produced may, perhaps, not have any such meaning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.28      A separate questionnaire was developed to estimate capital cost of train-&#13;
ing migrants and of the employment exchange programme. Information such as quantity&#13;
of land under different use and its present market price, total floor space of&#13;
buildings and their current market value, and present cost estimate of other capi-&#13;
tal items like laboratory equipment, furniture and fittings, books and periodicals,&#13;
etc. were sought. While the response from smaller institutions was more or less&#13;
satisfactory, there were other problems from large establishments. Many of the&#13;
institutions did not have up to date records of their fixed assets such as per&#13;
acre price of land, per square feet cost of construction of buildings, etc. Some&#13;
institutions had knowledge about the approximate amount of land and valuable equip-&#13;
ment they had, but little about the total floor space of buildings. For some large&#13;
establishments where the information was not adequate figures for present capital&#13;
cost were estimated by the interviewers. Although it can be said that costs of&#13;
building materials are more or less uniform over the whole of Bangladesh, cost&#13;
of land varies from place to place. The price per acre of land in Dacca was as-&#13;
sumed to be Tk. 5,000,000 and for Chittagong and Rajshahi Tk. 300,000. The results&#13;
of cost estimation are presented in tabular form in Table 4.20.&#13;

E. Summary and Conclusion&#13;
4.29      In order to estimate total recurring cost, information was sought from&#13;
various institutions on the number of students enrolled and produced, number of&#13;
teachers available and their salary, amount spent on administrative and supporting&#13;
staff, etc. To determine the current cost of the employment exchange programme&#13;
information was obtained on the cost of administrative staff, supporting staff,&#13;
allowances and honoraria, etc. As described in the previous section, capital cost&#13;
was estimated according to information obtained from different institutions about&#13;
current market value of various fixed assets like land, buildings, laboratory equip-&#13;
ment, furniture and fittings, books and periodicals, etc.&#13;
4.30      Summary results of cost estimation is given in Table 4.21.  There may&#13;
be diverse reasons for one institution to have a higher recurring cost than another.&#13;
Generally it was found that technical institutions incurred more costs than non-&#13;
technical institutions. The agricultural university was found to have the highest&#13;
recurring expenditure per student enrolled whereas the agricultural college had the&#13;
highest recurring cost per student produced. The reason for higher recurring ex-&#13;
penditure per student enrolled in the agricultural university was due to high&#13;
administrative and miscellaneous expenditure and the difference in expenditure per&#13;
student produced might be due to the fact that the turnout of graduates at the&#13;
university was higher than that of the college. Price of land in Dacca and&#13;
outside made a lot of difference in the capital cost. Since the agricultural col-&#13;
lege in Dacca has a lot of farmland capital cost here is much more than that of the&#13;
agricultural university.&#13;

CHAPTER V&#13;
EFFECTS OF LABOUR MIGRATION ON MANNING OF PRODUCTION&#13;
AND SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS IN BANGLADESH&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
5.1       A labour surplus country like Bangladesh perhaps does not stand to lose&#13;
anything substantial on account of the migration of unskilled workers and semi-&#13;
skilled workers since the time and cost of their training is small and they are&#13;
easily replaced. The large majority of the employers interviewed on this point&#13;
generally agree with this position. This study will therefore confine itself to&#13;
analysing the effect of export of educated and skilled manpower on production in&#13;
Bangladesh, and for this they are classified into 14 groups as follows:&#13;
(a) Post Graduate medical specialists&#13;
(b) Graduate doctors&#13;
(c) Medical technicians&#13;
(d) Engineering graduates&#13;
(e) Engineering technicians&#13;
(f)  Engineering craftsmen&#13;
(g) Fibre technologists&#13;
(h) Agricultural professionals&#13;
(i) Master's Degree holders in natural sciences&#13;
(j) Master's Degree holders in economic sciences&#13;
(k) Master's Degree holders in social sciences&#13;
(1) Master's Degree holders in humanities&#13;
(m)  Training school teachers&#13;
(n) Generalists&#13;
The types of manpower covered by each category is shown in the Appendix) Table 54.&#13;
5.2       To assess the impact of labour migration, the economy will be divided&#13;
into the following sectors:&#13;
(a) Primary sector&#13;
(b) Economic overheads&#13;
(c) Socio-economic infrastructure&#13;
(d) Manufacturing&#13;
(e) Finance&#13;
(f) Administration&#13;
(g) Miscellaneous&#13;
The details of the sectors are given in the Appendix, Table 55.&#13;

The Method of Enquiry&#13;
5.3       Based on the optimism of a 99% response experienced by the Planning&#13;
Commission in all previous employment surveys undertaken, questionnaires were mailed&#13;
out to all employing units hiring educated manpower. These were followed by a&#13;
visit to some of them by investigators. But unfortunately the response from the&#13;
employers was only 69%. The rate of response was as follows:&#13;

Manufacturing                           742              451             61&#13;
Finance                                  72               58             81&#13;
Administration                          380              198             52&#13;
Miscellaneous                           284              156             55&#13;
Total                                 3,389            2,325             69&#13;
5.4       Assuming that the rate of responding establishments constituted a ran-&#13;
dom sample from the population of total establishments, the number of vacant posts&#13;
and the number of persons migrating have been estimated based on the information&#13;
of this random sample. This assumption was confirmed and substantiated by the&#13;
findings of a post-enumeration sample which indicated that the estimated number of&#13;
vacant positions and migrants differ nominally from those furnished by the sample&#13;
survey. In addition, examination results and present annual enrolment capacity&#13;
of various branches of the national education and training network were collected&#13;
to estimate the present and future supply of the types of manpower going abroad.&#13;

Source:   Information on the total number of job aspirants and total number of jobs&#13;
is from the Planning Commission.  Data on estimated volume of vacancy&#13;
and estimated overseas employment was collected for this study.&#13;
The Approach to Estimation of the Impact of Labour Migration&#13;
5.6       Impact of labour migration on production will be shown in terms of the&#13;
shortage of a particular occupation or profession in relation to the demand for&#13;
this occupation. Needless to say that it is difficult to directly relate migration&#13;
of skilled manpower to loss of production, since linear and direct relationship&#13;
hardly exists between the absence of one or a group of members of staff and the total&#13;
volume of production of a production unit. Twenty percent of the positions vacant&#13;
do not necessarily mean 20% loss of production.&#13;
5.7       Now, an employed person going abroad may not leave a durable impact&#13;
on the organisation he has been serving. The effect may be shifted elsewhere.&#13;
For instance, if a Professor of surgery from Dacca Medical College goes abroad,&#13;
the post may be filled by transferring someone from Mymensingh Medical College and&#13;
the post in Mymensingh filled by promoting an Associate Professor from Sylhet Med-&#13;
ical College and transferring him to Mymensingh. It is quite possible that the&#13;
post of Associate Professor at Sylhet Medical College remains vacant for quite some&#13;
time. Similarly, the post of a migrating Senior Chemical Engineer from the Atomic&#13;
Energy Commission may have been filled by someone who was working in the Chemical&#13;
Corporation as a Junior Engineer, in this case, the person coming not on transfer&#13;
but on resignation from his previous employer. Even if in the former case, it is&#13;
remotely possible on the part of the Directorate of Health to relate the vacancy&#13;
at Sylhet Medical College to the migration from Dacca Medical College, it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 162 -&#13;
impossible on the part of the Chemical Corporation to know that it has been&#13;
affected by something happening in the Atomic Energy Commission. Therefore, a&#13;
total assessment of vacant positions throughout the employment market is necessary&#13;
to assess the effect of labour migration. Now, the following situations are&#13;
relevant here.&#13;
Situation I&#13;
5.8       If overall surplus (d) of any particular occupation is higher than&#13;
overseas employment (f), then manpower export is not a retarding factor for pro-&#13;
duction, even if vacant positions exist. The vacancy in that case is due to ad-&#13;
ministrative formalities for filling positions once vacancies occur. Under such&#13;
circumstances, the vacancies would remain when new production and service instal-&#13;
lations grow up within the country which must inevitably draw the mid-order pro-&#13;
fessionals of the existing firms to fill senior positions in the new establishments.&#13;
This is shown in Table 5.3.&#13;
Table 5.3: CASES WHERE MANPOWER EXPORT HAS NO ADVERSE EFFECT&#13;

Situation II&#13;
5.9       On the strength of Table 5.4 there could be a tendency to argue that if&#13;
f - d is higher than the volume of vacancy (e), it could mean that manpower export&#13;
is responsible not only for the volume of vacancy, but also for underqualified&#13;
appointments to the extent of f - d - e.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 163 -&#13;
The logic is not tenable. This is because, for manpower shortage, overseas employ-&#13;
ment cannot be responsible beyond its own size. The argument would have been ap-&#13;
plicable, if d in Table 5.4 happened to be positive. In reality, however, they&#13;
are all negative as shown in the Table. In fact, even without labour migration&#13;
some categories of manpower will be in deficit supply to the extent as shown in&#13;
the following Table.&#13;

extent the former is proportionate to the total deficit in a certain category of&#13;
manpower. This is shown in the equation f/(f - d) x 100 in Table 5.6.&#13;

vantage of the positions filled due to the resultant imperfect substitutions.&#13;

In the ultimate analysis, the loss to production on account of labour migration&#13;
is somewhere between the value added implications of size of migration in Table&#13;
5.8 and column 3 of Table 5.9 with size of migration in Table 5.8 (size of&#13;
migration and the inappropriate job placement within the economy).&#13;
C. The Anticipated Position in 1983&#13;
5.14      The 1978 position having been assessed, it may be pertinent to see what&#13;
might be the position in the near future, say in 1983, due to the migration of the&#13;
educated labour force from Bangladesh which is already in the pipeline. As can&#13;
be seen from Table 5.10 the demand for educated and skilled manpower over a five&#13;
year period has been generally 50% higher than that during the previous five year&#13;
period.&#13;

a 100% increase. The supply can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy&#13;

5.18      Excess supply over the estimated demand for graduate doctors may seem a&#13;
little unusual in view of the high doetor:population ratio now prevalent in the&#13;
country. It should, however, be appreciated that in a country where 80% of the&#13;
population is below the poverty line, not in a position to hire the services of&#13;
graduate doctors and implement their prescriptions, clientele of medical graduates'&#13;
exclusive private practices will not be big enough to absorb the number of doctors&#13;
available after filling the salaried positions as shown in Table 5.14.&#13;

It should also be borne in mind that doctors in salaried positions in Government-&#13;
owned health units enjoy a natural advantage in respect to private practice which,&#13;
in fact, is dominated by them.&#13;
5.19      In determining the excess supply of other occupations for overseas em-&#13;
ployment, it is important to emphasize that presently there is considerable imper-&#13;
fect substitution and inappropriate placement in the job market. For instance, many&#13;
of the posts meant for engineering graduates are not only filled by experienced and&#13;
senior diploma holding engineering technicians, but also by Master's Degree holders&#13;
in physics, applied physics, chemistry, applied chemistry and in some cases B.Sc.s&#13;
and I.Sc.s who may or may not have acquired the desired efficiency through long&#13;
in-service experience and training.  Likewise, many of the posts meant for engineering&#13;
technicians are held by B.Sc.s, I.Sc.s and matriculates. Post of medical technicians&#13;
are filled more with I.Sc.s and matriculates than with the professional certificate&#13;
holders. In posts meant for high level agricultural professionals, there are many&#13;
Master's Degree holders in chemistry, soil science, botany, zoology, B.Sc.s and in&#13;
some cases I.Sc.s and graduates. Many of the posts for diploma holders in agri-&#13;
culture are occupied by I.Sc.s and matriculates. The same is true of fibre tech-&#13;
nologists.&#13;
5.20      Some examples may be cited to illustrate the point.  In 1975 two batches&#13;
of engineering graduates and engineering technicians remained unemployed for a con-&#13;
siderable period of time and the situation improved only when opportunities in&#13;
the Middle East were opened to them. This was at a time when the estimated re-&#13;
quirement of graduate and diploma engineers within the country was higher than&#13;
&#13;

their availability. To give a recent example, presently the Ministry of Health finds&#13;
it difficult to absorb a few batches of dental technicians (a scarce skill even by&#13;
international standards) produced recently because-of the fact that posts are oc-&#13;
cupied by under-qualified persons and new posts of dental technicians in the&#13;
hospitals and clinics are not big enough to fully absorb the continuous stream&#13;
of dental technicians. Hence, in evaluating the job market for them within the&#13;
country, the additional supply over 1978-83 has to be compared with the additional&#13;
demand over the same period.&#13;
5.21      Judged on the basis of this, the country stands to lose by an excessive&#13;
export of the categories of manpower listed in Table 5.15. However, moderate&#13;
overseas employment of such professionals can be allowed. A sizable imperfect&#13;
substitution or inappropriate placement will inevitably creep in despite efforts&#13;
to prevent it.&#13;
5.22      For the categories of manpower listed in Table 5.15 the availability of&#13;
persons with more than 10 years experience is higher than the requirement. This&#13;
is shown in Table 5.16.&#13;
5.23      In respect to engineering craftsmen and fibre technologists, the share&#13;
of institutionally trained persons in the total demand in June 1978 was as fol-&#13;
lows:&#13;

5.24      Given the recruitment practices, the share of institutionally trained&#13;
persons for the two types of manpower in question will not increase over the&#13;
course of the next five years. Hence, from 1978-83 the job market for these two&#13;
types of occupations will be as shown in Table 5.18.  For the present, the country&#13;
can allow some migration of engineering craftsmen and fibre technologists.&#13;

CHAPTER VTI&#13;
PROJECTION OF MANPOWER DEMAND IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE&#13;
PROSPECTS AND POSSIBILITIES OF MANPOWER EXPORT FROM BANGLADESH&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
6.1       Recently the labour-scarce and oil-rich Arab countries have made&#13;
massive capital investments in development activities for which they are im-&#13;
porting labour from both the developing and developed countries, so much so that&#13;
more than half of the total labour force of the Arab countries is comprised&#13;
of foreign labourers. The volume of labour trade has doubled within the last&#13;
few years, and labour export has turned into a big source of foreign exchange&#13;
earnings of the labour exporting developing countries. It is therefore important&#13;
to assess the demand for manpower in the Middle East in general, and the prospects&#13;
and possibilities of manpower export from Bangladesh in particular.&#13;
6.2       Tne purpose of this study will be to obtain information and analyze&#13;
the following:&#13;
(a) The existing structure of the labour market in the Middle East.&#13;
(b) Projection of labour demand in the Middle East and North Africa&#13;
according to sectors and occupations.&#13;
(c) Supplementary information with regard to prospective demand collected&#13;
by the author from his survey of the embassies of the Middle Eastern&#13;
countries located in Bangladesh.&#13;
(d) Supply of manpower in the Middle East.&#13;
(e) Existing structure of the labour market in Bangladesh.&#13;
(f) Prospects and possibilities of supply of labour by skill and occupa-&#13;
tion from Bangladesh to the Middle East.&#13;
B. The Structure of the Labour Market in the Middle East&#13;
(i) Demand for Labour&#13;
6.3       Economic forces are the basic determinants of the international migra-&#13;
tion of labour. In Arab countries it is the strength of oil wealth and its&#13;
uses which determine the volume, pattern and direction of demand for labour.&#13;
The exploitation of oil resources and the investment of royalties in the pro-&#13;
gramme of modernization in the Arab countries generated the demand for manpower&#13;
from abroad. At the early stage there was little attempt to expand economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173 -&#13;
activities. During the 1960s oil revenue began to increase quickly and invest-&#13;
ment in social infrastructure and overheads began, at this stage, with the&#13;
establishment of schools, hospitals, construction of roads, highways and airports&#13;
and provision of essential utilities like water distillation plants, supply of&#13;
drinking water, etc. This resulted in the demand for construction workers during&#13;
this period. Since the early 1970s the oil revenues increased tremendously&#13;
and the trend continued thereafter. This increased revenue was invested&#13;
in productive sectors and in overheads to facilitate productive activities.&#13;
More roads were constructed, transport and communication sectors began to develop&#13;
and some manufacturing activities, especially in heavy industries based on oil&#13;
energy, were established. With the modernization programme, more social infra-&#13;
structures were provided, modern schools were set up, urban housing and dwelling&#13;
units were constructed, and various utilities and services like electricity,&#13;
urban sewerage system, sanitation and health services were provided. With the&#13;
introduction and expansion of these activities the responsibility of the Govern-&#13;
ment has increased. The administration of justice, security and police services&#13;
and the national defence had to be provided and a rapid educational programme&#13;
had to be undertaken to give minimum education to the nationals for all these&#13;
lobs. It is obvious that these activities mainly involved construction resulting&#13;
in the demand for construction workers. A diversified demand for specialized&#13;
skills and services is gradually being created in the health, education and&#13;
urban sectors. Because of the shortage of basic infrastructures the develop-&#13;
ment of industries and agriculture has been rather slow. However, as already&#13;
mentioned earlier, the productive sectors have developed at varying degrees&#13;
in the Arab countries. The countrywise data will explain these characteristic&#13;
phenomena.&#13;
6.4       United Arab Emirates.  United Arab Emirates are comprised of Abu Dhabi,&#13;
Dubai, Sharjan, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, Ajman, Uman Al Qaiwan and a few other&#13;
small islands. Current and future development programmes in UAE include&#13;
development of urban-industrial areas for industrial location, gas processing&#13;
plants, a fertilizer plant, an iron and steel works, petro-chemical plants and&#13;
cement factories. Between 1968 and 1975 total employment increased 19% per&#13;
annum and national manpower supply increased at the yearly rate of 3.8% which is&#13;
slightly more than the population growth rate of 3% per annum. So the ambitious&#13;
programme of modernization will create increasing demand for manpower with diverse&#13;
skills from abroad. 1/&#13;
6.5       Qatar.  Qatar started the programme of modernization in 1972.  A&#13;
fertilizer plant and a flour mill were established, infrastructural and social&#13;
services including fresh water, electricity, schools, hospitals, roads and ports&#13;
were developed. The current and future programme of modernization includes&#13;
another fertilizer plant, a natural gas liquifaction plant, a petro-chemical&#13;
complex, a steel mill and a cement plant, some infrastructural projects like&#13;
power generating plants, water distillation units and expansion of port facil-&#13;
ities, housing facilities and education facilities. A few light industries&#13;

for bricks, tiles, paper tissues, paints, detergents, cosmetics, batteries,&#13;
car tyres and glass products will also be developed. So demand for manpower&#13;

oil industry and the import-export trade. Recently the economy has been de-&#13;
veloping diversifying activities like manufacturing industries mainly based on&#13;
natural gas and oil, ship repairing, shipbuilding and engineering and there has&#13;
been a significant development in banking and hotel industries. So port workers&#13;
and service workers are the largest employment areas in Bahrain. The following&#13;
Table shows that service sectors employ the largest number of labourers and these&#13;
sectors are gradually expanding over time.&#13;

The above Table shows that the demand for manpower in the service industries is&#13;
the highest, and gradually the expanding productive sectors will demand diverse&#13;
occupational classes.&#13;
6.7       Kuwait.  Economic development in Kuwait started in three phases.  In&#13;
the first phase Kuwait developed her infrastructure and social services. This&#13;
phase continued from the early fifties up to 1962. During this period water,&#13;
electricity, roads, hospitals and Government offices were established. During&#13;
the second phase from 1962 to 1973 banking and a few large import substitution&#13;
industries such as chemical fertilizers, asbestos, prefabricated housing&#13;
materials, cement, metal pipes, flour mills and fisheries were developed. 2/&#13;

During the third phase which began in 1973, capital-intensive industries based&#13;
on relatively cheap sources of energy and abundance of capital began to be es-&#13;
tablished and with this more improved financial institutes like the Industrial&#13;
Development Bank were established. During the 1976-81 Development Plan 31.6%&#13;
of the total allocation has been made for housing, 20.6% for manufacturing and&#13;
12.1% for electricity and water. 1/ Employment statistics in 1975 shows that&#13;
48.5% of the total expatriate labourers were employed in community and personal&#13;
services, 15.7% in trade, 14.4% in construction, 10.5% in manufacturing and the&#13;
rest in other sectors. 2/ Among the non-Kuwaiti labour force, production workers&#13;
and unskilled labourers accounted for 34% , skilled and semi-skilled manual workers&#13;
accounted for 29.4%, skilled and semi-skilled office workers for 18% and the rest&#13;
belonged to other occupations. 3/ Skillwise the 1975 proportionate structure of&#13;
demand for expatriate manpower appears to continue in view of the orientation&#13;
of development programmes. The non-nationals are more numerous than nationals&#13;
in all occupations except teaching. 4/&#13;
6.8       Saudi Arabia.  The Government Development Project composition indicates&#13;
that agriculture, construction and industry are the three major sectors after&#13;
mining. Transport and services come next. Plan allocation has placed predominant&#13;
eumphasis on education, physical infrastructure and manufacturing. The 1975-80&#13;
development programme made the highest allocation to physical infrastructure&#13;
(22.7%) followed by economic resource development (18.5%) and human resource&#13;
development (16.1%). 5/&#13;

6.9       Sultanate of Oman.  It will be observed in the following Table that&#13;
the share of agriculture in the GDP of Oman has gone down significantly from&#13;
15.8% in 1970 to 3.1% in 1974, while construction has increased from 8.2% in 1970&#13;
to 10.2% in 1974 and trade from 1.5% in 1970 to 4.8% in 1974. The largest number&#13;
of foreign workers are concentrated in professional, technical and managerial&#13;
trades. Nevertheless, the demand for semi-skilled, skilled, and manual workers&#13;
has been increasing over time at a larger rate than that for the professional and&#13;
technical groups. 1/ This trend in labour demand is explained by the highest&#13;
rate of expansion in construction and trade sectors as shown in the following&#13;

6.10      Yemen Arab Republic.  The feature of the composition of the GDP in the&#13;
following Table shows the Yemen Arab Republic has a diversified productive economy&#13;
where agriculture is overwhelmingly the largest sector. YAR economy thus has&#13;
some similarity with that of Bangladesh. A single large agricultural sector and&#13;
tiny industrial and other sectors explain this common characteristic phenomenon.&#13;
YAR has planned to develop infrastructure, human resources and industries to&#13;
achieve the long term objective of attaining self-sufficiency in agriculture. 1/&#13;
Thus it seems that YAR's development has similarity with the current development&#13;
programme of Bangladesh. The nature of manpower training and manpower require-&#13;
ments is also similar between the two countries. Probably these common factors&#13;
might encourage YAR to import more labour from Bangladesh.&#13;

6.11      Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.  Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has a diversified&#13;
economy.  The shares of agriculture and industry in the GDP are increasing&#13;
rapidly over time. The share of construction is also increasing simultaneously.&#13;
The country's current and future development programmes have given highest priority&#13;
to the development of agriculture followed by public health, industry and mining.&#13;

6.12      To sum up, it appears that the general trend in the programmes of&#13;
modernization in all Arab countries is towards the expansion of the productive&#13;
sectors and the development of human resources. Excepting a few specialized&#13;
skills for the production of specialized commodities, the existing demand for&#13;
various skills appears to expand in general.&#13;
(ii) Supply of Labour&#13;
6.13      It is pertinent to mention here that all countries in the Middle East&#13;
did not start modernization at the same time nor is the strength of wealth the&#13;
same for all of them. Among them the leading group consists of Iraq, Iran,&#13;
Egypt, Sudan and Libya. They have diverse resource bases which offer them the&#13;
possibilities for diversified programmes for economic development. They have&#13;
more water and cultivable land resources which gives them more independent growth&#13;
potentialities. The second group is comprised of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Yemen&#13;

countries own vast barren terrain and desert lands, have a dry climate and limited&#13;
water, sparse population and, in general,       lack domestic food supply.  As the&#13;
population is small, these countries must import labour from neighbouring&#13;
non-oil exporting countries, which have surplus population to man their develop-&#13;
ment programmes. The countries under the first group export labour to the second&#13;
group of countries and, excepting Egypt, also import cheaper labour of various&#13;
skills from non-Arab countries. These skills include doctors, engineers and re-&#13;
lated skills, drivers, agricultural specialists, skilled and semi-skilled manual&#13;
workers, etc.&#13;

employment by nationalities can be shown as follows:&#13;

6.15      There is, however, a geographical difference in the supply of skills.&#13;
The largest proportion of specialised and skilled workers come from Europe and&#13;
America. Unskilled labourers come, by and large, from Yemen Arab Republic and&#13;
Oman, while the majority of manual labourers are imported from India, Pakistan&#13;
and Bangladesh. In particular, defence, state administration, administration of&#13;
justice, police and security services are filled by the nationals and the same is&#13;
true for activities like trade and business, clerical work, various services and&#13;
ordinary manual work. A study by the World Bank on the occupational characteristics&#13;
of 1.3 million emigrant workers in Libya, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the&#13;
UAE shows that approximately 14% of this total are employed in professional, tech-&#13;
nical and managerial occupations, about 19% are employed in clerical and service&#13;
jobs and the remaining 67% are semi-skilled and unskilled workers in construction,&#13;
agriculture and other sectors. 1/ In 1978 about 2 million emigrant labourers&#13;
were working in the oil exporting countries of the Middle East and North Africa&#13;
and in a number of countries where the native supply of manpower is very small,&#13;

- 181 -&#13;
employment of non-nationals is greater than the nationals. For example foreign&#13;
workers account for 84.8% in UAE, 81.1% in Qatar and 69.4% in Kuwait in 1978.&#13;
In the whole region combined, the percentage of foreign workers is 52.8% which is&#13;
more than half of the total employment.&#13;
(iii) Future Structure of Demand for Labour in the Middle East&#13;
6.16       To estimate the magnitude and pattern of future demand for manpower&#13;
in the Middle East, information about the present patterns of labour import, demo-&#13;
graphy, education, employment and economic development and their future programmes&#13;
and orientations is necessary.  No published or unpublished information on these&#13;
aspects is available from these countries.  The embassies of the Middle Eastern&#13;
countries were approached for data on the future development programmes and priorities&#13;
in the Arab countries.  Excepting the Libyan Embassy, none of the other Arab em-&#13;
bassies was able to provide the necessary data for the analytical basis of this&#13;
study. The information gathered was descriptive rather than quantitative.&#13;
6.17       The future trend in the structural change envisaged in the Arab countries,&#13;
with the exception of Iraq and Iran which have a larger productive sector than the&#13;
other Arab countries, can be briefly indicated. Over the next five to ten years&#13;
professionals, skilled and semi-skilled labour will be in considerable demand.&#13;
Firstly, during the coming decade, agriculture will be considered to be the priority&#13;
sector in the National Development Programmes, creating additional demand for various&#13;
skills in the agricultural sector. Since most of the Arab countries emphasize&#13;
large scale mechanized farming, the agricultural labour will have to be trained to&#13;
handle agricultural machinery and implements like tractors, irrigation machinery,&#13;
harvesting and sowing machines, etc. Secondly, the demand for electrical engineers,&#13;
electrical technicians, mechanical engineers, mechanics, and civil engineers will&#13;
continue in the future. Thirdly, demand for drivers of all types of vehicles&#13;
will increase as time passes. Fourthly, the labour demand for construction and&#13;
communication sectors will mainly be comprised of masons, crane drivers, lifters,&#13;
etc. Construction will still remain the largest sector. The major investment will&#13;
be made on the construction of roads, housing, hospitals, schools and various agri-&#13;
cultural overheads. Lastly, most industries will be agro-based and based on&#13;
minerals. These are readymade clothes and garments, ordinary textiles, fish products,&#13;
food canning, olive canning and petro-chemical industries. The demand for unskilled&#13;
labour from abroad has been projected to be small.&#13;
6.18       From the above profile of the future demand, it appears that more diver-&#13;
sified skilled labour will be needed with the gradual expansion of the productive&#13;
sectors in the Middle East. The survey also indicates that the demand for teachers&#13;
from abroad will gradually be smaller because firstly, partial need will be met from&#13;
within the Arab countries because of common language and common culture, and secondly,&#13;
the rest of the demand is open to the international competition in the supply market.&#13;
6.19       The findings of the survey corresponds to the demand for manpower in the&#13;
Middle East as projected by the World Bank research group. Table 6.3(a) shows&#13;
sectorwise estimated total demand for manpower to be generated as a result of the&#13;
estimated growth of the sectors over the period 1980-85, while Table 6.3(b) shows&#13;
the trend and magnitude of demand for manpower according to skills and occupations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 182 -&#13;
6.20      Table 6.3(a) shows that though construction will still employ quite a&#13;
large number of labourers in proportion to the total employment during the early&#13;
1980s, the service sector will employ the largest amount of manpower, and gradually&#13;
the trade and finance and agricultural labour force will be the third and fourth&#13;
highest figures by 1985, though in proportion the share of the agricultural labour&#13;
force will decline in 1985. In terms of change over time agriculture, utilities and&#13;
manufacture respectively show the highest growth rates though the demand for agri-&#13;
cultural labour force shows a gradually declining trend. There is a high and&#13;
stable correlation between the growth rates of manufacture and utilities. This is&#13;
obvious because with manufacturing activities there is a consequential aggregation&#13;
of activities and human habitation which gives rise to the demand for urban utilities&#13;
like sewerage systems, municipal services, supply of water and electricity, etc.&#13;
With the expansion of more of the modern sector, the demand for utilities will&#13;
increase further. The rate of increase of utilities will be even greater as more&#13;
revenues will be spent to increase the standard of living of the people. Per head&#13;
consumption of utilities will increase with the process of development, particularly&#13;
in the urban sector. In 1985 these phenomena are reflected in the highest growth&#13;
rate of the labour demand in utilities and the relatively low rate of growth in the&#13;
demand for agricultural labour. Higher rates of increase of labour demand are ex-&#13;
pected in manufacturing, utilities, mining, construction, trade and finance.&#13;
Transport, communication and the services sector do not, however, show this correla-&#13;
tion, mainly because these sectors employ nationals and Arabs in the largest pro-&#13;
portion and the lowest number of expatriates, as has been discussed earlier.&#13;
6.21      Table 6.3(b) shows that occupationwise the rate of increase in demand for&#13;
unskilled manual workers will be the highest, followed by specialised professionals&#13;
and technical hands during the early 1980s, while in 1985 unskilled and manual&#13;
workers will be in least demand. This phenomenon is explained by the fact that&#13;
with a higher level of modernization a larger proportion of labour saving devides&#13;
like mechanical automation will be likely to be introduced, which will in turn reduce&#13;
the demand for semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers. This trend thus corres-&#13;
ponds with the sectorwise demand structure for manpower from abroad in Table 6.3(a),&#13;
which shows that the highest growth rate will be in the utilities and other pro-&#13;
ductive sectors like agriculture and manufacturing in the early 1980s and from 1985&#13;
the demand for agricultural labour will fall, while the modern sectors will register&#13;
larger increases. This observation cannot, however, be conclusive because larger&#13;
numbers of national and non-national Arabs may also capture this section of labour&#13;
demand over time or perhaps after the mid-1980s the growth of agriculture will be&#13;
slowed down because of the natural barriers imposed by water shortages, lack of&#13;
cultivable land or the limiting capacity of land development. The above data have&#13;
been projected after due consideration of the future supply of local manpower&#13;
education and training, employment and future prospects and possibilities for&#13;
economic development.&#13;

l/   This occupational classification is different from the classification made&#13;
by the experts of this Labour Migration Project in Bangladesh. In our&#13;
classification we have five occupations groups, viz: Professional, Tech-&#13;
nical, Skilled, Semi-skilled and Unskilled. The details of both the clas-&#13;
sifications appe.ar in the Appendix. Therefore, occupationwise analysis&#13;
of demand and supply of manpower between the Middle East and Bangladesh is&#13;
a rough approximation between the two classifications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. Existing Structure of Labour Market in Bangladesh&#13;
6.22      Demand for Labour in Bangladesh.  The economic activities create de-&#13;
mand for labour, while the existing volume of activities determines the extent of&#13;
current demand for manpower. The future expansion of economic activities and&#13;
future changes in the structure of activities determine the nature, character&#13;
and magnitude of demand for manpower over time. In general, the magnitude of&#13;
unemployment indicates that the domestic market is not adequate to absorb the&#13;
country's present and prospective labour force. Yet the index of supply and&#13;
demand shows that there is a much bigger market for absorption of certain skills&#13;
like doctors, engineers, etc. who are in short supply according to the needs of&#13;
the country at present and in future.&#13;
6.23      Supply of Labour in Bangladesh.  Bangladesh, with 85 million people in&#13;
an area of 55 thousand square miles in 1977-78, is one of the most densely popu-&#13;
lated countries in the world. The total labour force in the country was estimated&#13;
to be 29.9 million in the same year, increasing at a rate of 2.5% per year. The&#13;
level of unemployment in 1978 was estimated to be 8.1 million. 1/&#13;
6.24      Demand and Supply of Educated and Trained Manpower in Bangladesh.  Look-&#13;
ing at the relative position of supply and demand in Bangladesh according to skill&#13;
and training, it appears that there is a surplus of more than 500,000 graduates&#13;
and post graduates in both general and science education, although there is an&#13;
acute shortage in the supply of professionals like doctors, electrical and mechan-&#13;
ical engineers and of technical skills like electrical foremen, overhead electri-&#13;
cians, etc. 2/ Not much is known about the magnitude of unemployment and the ex-&#13;
tent of disguised unemployment in terms of skill classification and activities.&#13;
Similarly, information with regard to hidden unemployment in the sense that many&#13;
over-qualified graduates are employed where lower level educational degrees could&#13;
serve the purpose, is not available. But estimating the supply of skilled and trained&#13;
manpower from the enrolment strength in the various educational and professional&#13;
institutions in Bangladesh, 3/ and from the register of BMET showing people with&#13;
different trades and skills seeking employment abroad in 1979, it comes out clearly&#13;
that there is a scarcity of certain skills and an oversupply of other skills. Thus&#13;
the phenomenon appears to create a situation of crisis among abundances.&#13;
6.25      Projection of Supply of Manpower in Bangladesh.  It is also relevent to&#13;
project the supply of manpower according to education and training in Bangladesh&#13;
over a certain period in the future. This will indicate the feasibility of ex-&#13;
panding the export of various skills given the demand for manpower by the Middle&#13;
East as projected in the preceding section. Projection of supply can be made&#13;
with two alternative hypotheses:&#13;
(a) If the supply of the educational and training institutions remains&#13;
constant.&#13;
1/   See Table 1.1.&#13;
2/   See Table 5.2.&#13;
3/   See Table 1.4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 186 -&#13;
(b) If the supply of the educational and training institutions&#13;
is increased or reorganized.&#13;
Under the first assumption it is difficult to project the supply of doctors, en-&#13;
gineers and certain rare skills like powerhouse foreman or overhead electricians&#13;
who have 5 to 10 years of job experience. The primary school leavers from 40,313&#13;
primary schools, a large number of high school dropouts, graduates from 9,299&#13;
secondary and higher secondary schools, graduates from 338 degree colleges, honours&#13;
graduates and Master's degree holders from 6 universities, and graduates from about&#13;
1,830 Madrasahs can almost meet the entire projected demand for semi-skilled and&#13;
unskilled manual and clerical workers in the Middle East over 1980-85. 1/ This&#13;
rough estimation does not include the uneducated manpower available for manual&#13;
work of an unskilled or semi-skilled nature, especially in construction, repairs,&#13;
municipal and various other services. BMET also shows a large number of surplus&#13;
graduates from 114,155 enrolments which will be available for export to meet the&#13;
increasing demand for technical, skilled and semi-skilled manpower. 2/ Under the&#13;
second hypothesis, with the reorganization and reorientation of educational and&#13;
and training institutions and the expansion of the base of on-the-job training,&#13;
the supply of all categories of occupation can be increased to a large extent,&#13;
particularly in the technical, skilled and semi-skilled category if training and&#13;
augmentation are provided to the millions of unemployable secondary and higher&#13;
secondary school graduates, Madrasah graduates, dropouts from all levels and&#13;
graduates and degree holders from colleges and universities (of course the reor-&#13;
ientation programme may reduce the importance of colleges and general educational&#13;
institutions). So under the second hypothesis, the entire demand of almost all&#13;
categories, excepting some areas of professional and technical skills, may be&#13;
supplied.&#13;
D. Prospects and Possibilities of Export of Labour from Bangladesh&#13;
to the Middle East&#13;
6.26      Technically and organizationally the manpower industry is different&#13;
from other industries which manufacture goods and services. Decisions made about&#13;
manpower planning need to take account of the existing and prospective demand.&#13;
The trend in the structure of manpower development will depend upon the trend in&#13;
the development and structural changes of the entire economy at home. Orientation&#13;
for export requires similar information about the countries which import manpower.&#13;
The forces of activities which generate demand for various skills in the Middle&#13;
East have been analysed. The existing structure of demand for manpower in the&#13;
Middle East is likely to continue for quite a long time. And with the gradual&#13;
increase of production activities through the expansion of agricultural and&#13;
manufacturing industries additional demand for agricultural and industrial labour&#13;
forces, both skilled and unskilled, will be created. But the prospects of supply&#13;
from Bangladesh are constrained by many factors, both internal and external.&#13;
1/   The number of educated people below university level was estimated at over&#13;
11.3 million in 1976.&#13;
21   See Table 1.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6.27      Internal Constraints. Data on labour export by occupation from Bangladesh&#13;
to the Arab countries for the years 1976, 1977 and 1978 were provided earlier. l/&#13;
The character of export of manpower shows that Bangladesh is currently supplying&#13;
almost all skills. But the prospect of supply appears to be unlimited for semi-&#13;
skilled and unskilled labour from Bangladesh. This category of unlimited supply&#13;
may also include a large number of unemployed and unemployable general graduates&#13;
from high schools, senior high schools, post high school levels and dropouts from&#13;
all levels. Currently these semi-skilled and unskilled labourers are supplied by&#13;
the Arab countries and they are not in much demand from abroad. But Madrasah&#13;
graduates from Bangladesh can always be made available to meet this demand as&#13;
explained in the preceding paragraphs. The specialists, professionals, doctors,&#13;
engineers, and skilled technicians are in great demand in the Middle East and this&#13;
is likely to continue over quite a long period of time. Bangladesh unfortunately&#13;
has an acute shortage of these skills to meet internal requirements. These skills&#13;
are migrating to the Middle East by evading Government controls and restrictions&#13;
and this causes a high social cost to Bangladesh. Without making changes in the&#13;
structure of training and education to enhance the supply of these skills, the&#13;
prospect of future export of these selected skills appears to be negative. Measures&#13;
for quality control will remain important for promotion of manpower export from&#13;
Bangladesh. The elimination of indiscriminate selection, the drive for exploration&#13;
of vacancies and job contracts, and the goodwill of the Bangladeshi workers abroad&#13;
are a few of the measures upon which the future expansion of the export of manpower&#13;
from Bangladesh will largely depend.&#13;
6.28      External Constraints.  Bangladesh is also expected to face constraints&#13;
from external sources which are worth considering in future planning. The inter-&#13;
national supply market of manpower is highly competitive. The competitive labour&#13;
suppliers of all categories from Asia are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, India,&#13;
Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The competition has&#13;
been made tougher because of the participation in labour supply by the developed&#13;
countries like the United States of America, Japan and European countries. Table&#13;
6.4(a) shows the participants in manpower trade. The volume of intra-Arab trade in&#13;
manpower is quite big and will be a potential source of competition in even rare&#13;
skills after the Arab countries develop their own skills through education and&#13;
training. Tables 6.4(b)I and 6.4(b)II show the volume of intra-Arab countries&#13;
manpower trade while Table 6.4(c) shows the countrywise shares in the manpower&#13;
export trade.&#13;

6.28      It can be seen from Table 6.4(a) that quite a large number of countries&#13;
participate in the manpower export trade. Among the labour importing countries,&#13;
UAE, Qatar and Kuwait had the largest percentages of foreign employment in proportion&#13;
to the total employment in 1975. These proportions are 80% for UAE, 77% for&#13;
Qatar, and 71% for Kuwait. Except for short term variations arising from political&#13;
differences, the geographical proximity, linguistic, social and cultural homogeniety&#13;
cause an obvious preference for manpower from other Arab countries. This is clear&#13;
from Tables 6.4(b)I and 6.4(b)II. During 1975 the share of all Asia was only&#13;
17.7% of the export of manpower and Bangladesh shared only 0.2% in proportion&#13;
to the total export of manpower to the Middle East. The Asian emigrants have increased&#13;
from 17.7% in 1975 to 43.61% in 1977.&#13;
6.29      Table 6.4(d) shows that the rate of increase of manpower export from&#13;
Bangladesh has been growing steadily. The rate of increase of manpower export&#13;
from Bangladesh is greater than the rate of increase of the total export. The rates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 191 -&#13;
of increase of manpower export from Bangladesh are 258% from 1976 to 1977 and&#13;
145% from 1977 to 1978 and the total volume of manpower export from all countries&#13;
combined increased by 145% from 1975 to 1977. The data of 1975 for Bangladesh are&#13;
not available for comparison.&#13;
6.30      Concluding Remarks.  Since the economic activities will be increasing in&#13;
the Middle East the time is ripe for Bangladesh to tap an increasing share in the&#13;
demand for manpower from this region. But what the proportional share of Bangla-&#13;
deshi manpower will be in the potential demand of the Middle Eastern countries is&#13;
rather difficult to predict accurately. In addition to conventional factors of&#13;
manpower promotion in Bangladesh and promotion of friendly relations with the&#13;
Arab countries, there is a genuine limitation due to the intra-Arab exchange of&#13;
labour which is based upon intra-Arab factor cost differences and differences&#13;
in the level of development and amenities of life and living. Given the fact that&#13;
some of the Middle Eastern countries have made more progress than others in the&#13;
field of education and training and have a large number of skilled people educated&#13;
and trained abroad, they might trade on manpower to earn gain out of factor cost&#13;
and standard of living differentials. Egypt alone can supply trained manpower in&#13;
different skills to other Arab countries. In addition Egypt trains manpower from&#13;
other Middle Eastern countries. Though Iraq, Yemen, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia,&#13;
Oman, Algeria and Morocco heavily import various skills from both Arab countries&#13;
and outside, a large proportion of their nationals work in other Arab countries.&#13;
For example, the total volume of manpower imports of Saudi Arabia, Libya, Kuwait,&#13;
Qatar, Bahrain and UAE in 1978 was 1,648,252, out of which 1,236,600 (75%) was&#13;
supplied by the Arab countries. This phenomenon is observable from Table 6.4(b)I&#13;
above.&#13;
6.31      The most serious impediment in Bangladesh appears to arise from the inter-&#13;
nal limitation of the system to increase the supply of the categories of skills&#13;
that will be in demand abroad. The structure of demand is not stable but changes&#13;
with the changing structure of development of the economy of the Middle East.&#13;
These processes are irreversible and non-exchangeable. Under the existing physical,&#13;
climatic and socio-economic conditions, programmes in most of the Arab countries&#13;
probably had to choose a model where priority was given to construction of socio-&#13;
economic infrastructure like roads, bridges, highways, educational and technical&#13;
institutions and other administrative buildings. This infrastructure model may&#13;
take 5 to 10 years and this type of monolithic model is possible in Arab countries&#13;
which are undeveloped and dependent upon a single resource, petroleum, which is&#13;
exchanged for everything. Naturally, under the construction model, the construction&#13;
workers both skilled and unskilled, some service workers, machine operators, drivers,&#13;
etc. were needed. So to meet these requirements orientation in manpower training&#13;
and education would be necessary to supply appropriate types of construction workers&#13;
and construction engineers. But in the next stage the development model may shift&#13;
to investment in direct productive activities, in industries and in agriculture.&#13;
In this case the change in demand will be towards specialists in these fields and&#13;
to meet this changing demand, the reorientation of the system of education and training&#13;
will be called for in Bangladesh. This readjustment is not easy and may not be&#13;
feasible economically and socially. Economic cost will involve capital investment&#13;
in buildings, machinery and instruments and recurring expenditure will involve&#13;
hiring trainers in this new field. Training the trainers will also be necessary&#13;
first, thus a time factor is involved. However, this is of minor importance in a&#13;
country like Bangladesh where there are supplies for a minimum number of trainers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 192 -&#13;
in most fields, but the capital cost required will be a greater burden.&#13;
6.32      What will happen to the trained people already exported abroad to meet&#13;
the demand for the construction model when they return home after a few years?&#13;
The same question may be posed for all other stages in the changing structure of&#13;
demand. The social cost appears to be more complicatdd adjustment and reorienta-&#13;
tion. Readjustment and reorientation also are constrained by scarcity of resources.&#13;
How can the conflict and cost in this process be evaluated? Problems will be in-&#13;
finite; questions are difficult to answer and can not be dealt with in this study.&#13;
6.33      Though it is not within the scope of this project, it will be useful to&#13;
make a study of comparative wage levels of different skills in a few selected&#13;
countries which compete for labour exports. Thus we can see the comparative ad-&#13;
vantage of a few or all categories of skill among the labour exporting countries.&#13;
Such a study might help in programming to increase the supply of the skills which&#13;
are in high demand in the Arab countries.&#13;
6.34      It will be noticed in Table 6.4(c) above that the proportionate share of&#13;
labour export from Bangladesh is one of the lowest among the Asian countries.&#13;
The reason is that Bangladesh has turned to the issue of manpower export promo-&#13;
tion much later than other Asian countries. Recently a larger proportion of Bangla-&#13;
deshi labourers are in demand because it is said that they are the cheapest to employ.&#13;
But this increasing trend has been counter-balanced by the indiscriminate sub-&#13;
standard recruitment by the recruiting agents, corruption among the Government&#13;
officials and fraudulent practices by the emigrants under individual efforts. So&#13;
the share in the supply largely depends on the non-economic factors arising from&#13;
the qualities of the organisations and institutions handling various aspects of&#13;
manpower promotion and manpower exports in Bangladesh. The extent to which Bangla-&#13;
desh will be able to expand the volume of manpower export will depend upon the&#13;
future strength of supply of the most demanded skills on one hand and on the com-&#13;
parative strength in the competitive supply market on the other. A planned and&#13;
concerted effort is therefore imperative for future expansion of manpower export&#13;
from Bangladesh.&#13;

CHIPTER VII&#13;
SOCIAL COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF  AINPOWMR EXPORT FROM BANGLADESH&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
7.1      Bangladesh joined the Great Rush to the Middle East just&#13;
about half way in the decade of the seventies, and since then both&#13;
the annual outflow of migrants as well as the iniflow of remittance&#13;
sent by them have growrn by leaps and bounds. From a meagre 6,087 in&#13;
1976, the rate of emigration accelerated to 24,485 by 1979. The rate&#13;
of remittance swelled at the same time from a trickle of Tk.4.05&#13;
million per month in 1974 to a torrent of Tk.241 million in 1979. In&#13;
fact total remittance in the fiscal year 1978-79 (amounting to Tk.2,437.8&#13;
million ) had a size of nearly one-fourth of the total export earnings&#13;
of Bangladesh. Both the outflow of manpower and the inflow of remittance&#13;
in this scale are bound to have significant repercussions on various&#13;
sectors of the domestic economy. An evaluation of these consequences is&#13;
essential for formulating a socially desirable policy of manpower export.&#13;
7.2      A conventional cost-benefit analysis, however, can encompass&#13;
only a part of the manifold consequences of large-scale emigration. Quite&#13;
a few of its impacts on social welfare cannot be quantified adequately&#13;
and some not at all. Thus, only the directly quantifiable consequences&#13;
such as the flow of remittance, the loss of domestic production and the&#13;
impact of remittance on savings and distribution must of necessity form&#13;
the major ingredients of such an analysis. As we shall see, even these&#13;
entities do not lend themselves to easy quantification, specially in a&#13;
country like Bangladesh where the quality of record-keeping on various&#13;
aspects of manpower export does not quite match the national enthusiasm&#13;
for this phenomenon.&#13;
7.3      However, even before one sets about the task of quantification&#13;
of details, one may make the reasonably safe hypothesis that at least in&#13;
terms of the conventional ingredients of cost-benefit analysis, it is&#13;
hardly likely that migration of Bangladeshi nationals to the Middle 3ast&#13;
may prove in general to be socially undesirable. The reason is simply that&#13;
on the one hand the gain in terms of remittance is quite large given the&#13;
level of overseas wages; and on the other hand the loss in domestic&#13;
production is often much less than what it appears to be, owing to the&#13;
existence of huge unemployment and underemployment. Y'he impact on income&#13;
distribution may not always be in the right direction, but this is not&#13;
very likely to outweigh the direct gain of resources.&#13;
7.4      The practical usefulness of a cost-benefit analysis of emigration&#13;
in a situation like this lies in answering the following questions:&#13;
(i) 'Lhat is the inter-ranking among different categories of&#13;
workers in terms of the social dividends emanating from&#13;
their emigration ? Is there any specific type of manpower&#13;
whose loss to the country will be socially harmful ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 194 -&#13;
(ii) What is the relative importance of different elements&#13;
of costs and benefits in determining the net present&#13;
value of emigration ?&#13;
(iii) How large is the absolute magnitude of the net present&#13;
value derived from emigration ? Is it likely to be&#13;
cancelled out if social costs and benefits are defined&#13;
in the broadest sense ?&#13;
7.5      Answers to these questions are crucial for the fornulation of&#13;
any enlightened policy of manpower export. The present exercise should&#13;
be viewed as a contribution towards that direction. In the next few&#13;
sections, we try to quantify the various ingredients required for a&#13;
social cost-benefit analysis and these are brought together in the final&#13;
section for calculating the net present value of emigration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 195 -&#13;
B. Level of Remittance&#13;
7.6        The most important direct benefit of emigration  is the remittance&#13;
sent home by the migrants working abroad. What we shall need for our analysis&#13;
is the estimate of the per capita remittance sent by different categories of&#13;
workers in a recent year. Unfortunately, there is no easy way of deriving&#13;
such estimates on the basis of available data. As we shall see, there is&#13;
enormous confusion regarding the total remittance itself, not to speak of its&#13;
breakdown according to the skill-categories of workers.&#13;
7.7       Total remittance may be defined so as to include the remittance&#13;
sent through official financial channels as well as the direct import of&#13;
goods through the Wage Earners' Scheme (WES) j. But data on the use of&#13;
remittance for direct import is available only for the period from August,&#13;
1978 to September, 1979. For this period, the ratio between financial&#13;
remittance and direct WEES import is 79:21 (estimated from Table 19,&#13;
Appdx. to Ch.II). The annual series of total remittance can be estimated&#13;
by applying this blow-up factor on the level of financial remittance&#13;
(see Table 7.1). There is, however, a problem for 1979 since data is not&#13;
available for the October-December period. For these months, monthly&#13;
remittance is assumed to be at the levelofthe average for the July-September&#13;
period which is Tk.243 million (in cash and kind combined). The total&#13;
remittance in 1979 is thus estimated to be Tk.2916 million ./.&#13;

Note: Based on Table 2.1, Ch.II. Annual figures are at the prevailing official&#13;
exchange rates. The devaluation in mid-1975 changed the official exchange&#13;
rate from US $ 1=Tk.8 to US $ 1 =Tk.15 (approximately).&#13;
7.8       The above figures relate to total remittance from all over the world,&#13;
while our immediate interest is to estimate remittance from the Middle East.&#13;
There are some official figures of remittance by country of origin (see Table&#13;
20, Appdx. to Ch.II).&#13;
j/ This would leave out the consumer durables brought in by the returning&#13;
migrants under the personal baggage rules and more importantly, remittance&#13;
sent through illegal channels; see Ashraf Ali's discussion in Ch.II.&#13;
L~/ Although direct import under WTES was stopped after August, 1979. we assume&#13;
that an equivalent amount of remittance would have found its way through&#13;
the financial channel in the later months of 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 196 -&#13;
But these do not provide the information we need, because it is well-known&#13;
that a substantial part of remittance originating from the Middle East is&#13;
routed through western financial centres and there is no way of identifying&#13;
the actual origin of remitted funds recorded against the names of these&#13;
centres. It is therefore necessary to adopt an indirect approach to&#13;
estimate the remittance from the Middle East.&#13;
7.9        During the period from 1976 to 1979, the emigration of Bangladeshi&#13;
workers to countries outside the Middle East has been negligible compared&#13;
to emigration to the Middle East. As such, the increase in remittance&#13;
from all over the world between these two years can be explained by two&#13;
factors: (i) remittance sent by the new emigrants in the Middle East&#13;
and (ii) the rise in the level of remittance from the existing stock&#13;
of Bangladeshi emigrants all over the world in 1976, consequent upon&#13;
the increase in their money wages jI.To eliminate the latter effect,&#13;
we inflate the level of world remittance in 1976 by a factor of 1.45&#13;
which is the UK wages/earnings index for July, 1979 with 1976 as the&#13;
base. The adjusted figure stands at Tk.706.5 million. Therefore, out&#13;
of the total remittance of Tk.2916 million in 1979, Tk.2209.5 million&#13;
is due to the increase in the net stock of migrants between 1976 and&#13;
1979, */ -&#13;
7.10      According to official records, the flow of emigrants from&#13;
Bangladesh to the M1iddle East increased from 6.1 thousand in 1976 to&#13;
24.5 thousand in 1979 (see Chapter I). For estimating remittance per&#13;
migrant in 1979, it should be borne in mind that not all of the&#13;
24.5 thousand new migrants in that year would possibly send remittance&#13;
for the full year. This number should therefore be reduced to the&#13;
'migrant year equivalent' for matching against the annual flow of&#13;
remittance. For this we make two assumptions : (i) that the volume&#13;
of migration remained the same in each month of 1979, and (ii) that&#13;
a new migrant starts remitting money with a lag of one month after&#13;
leaving the home country. These two assumptions together imply that&#13;
out of the total number of new migrants in 1979, only 46 percent&#13;
should be counted as 'migrant year equivalent'&#13;
j   One may think of yet another factor, namely, the incentive effect&#13;
of the Wage Earners' Scheme. This scheme must have had a salutary&#13;
effect on the remittance from the existing stock of emigrants even&#13;
at given levels of earnings, as is evidenced by the sharp increase&#13;
in the remittance flow after 1974, the year in which the Scheme&#13;
was initiated. (A part of this increase is however nominal due to&#13;
the devaluation of Taka in 1975: see Table 7.1). We have assumed&#13;
that the time-lag in the response to the new incentive would&#13;
not extend beyond two years so that the increase in remittance&#13;
after 1976 was entirely due to the two factors mentioned in the&#13;
text.&#13;
.g/ This would indicate that a very substantial proportion of remittance&#13;
money originating from the Middle East is routed through the Western&#13;
financial markets. Official records show that remittance from the&#13;
Middle East constituted only about half of the total financial&#13;
remittance during January-June, 1979. By using this low figure&#13;
of remittance from the Middle East as shown in the official records,&#13;
both Ashraf Ali (Ch.II) and Siddiqui (Ch.VIII) seriously underestimate&#13;
the level of remittance per worker from the Middle East.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 197 -&#13;
so far as remittance in that year is concerned, jj. Similarly, of the total&#13;
number of migrants in 1976, 54 percent will contribute to the annual flow of&#13;
remittance only after the end of that year.&#13;
7.11      Thus the 'effective' increase in the stock of migrants between the&#13;
full years of 1976 and 1979 turns out to be about 56 thousand. It would be&#13;
remembered that this figure is based on information about official gross&#13;
out-migration, that is, it does not take into account either unofficial/&#13;
illegal migration or the return of migrants. It can however be taken to&#13;
represent the net increase in the stock of Bangladeshi emigrants in the&#13;
Middle East under the assumption that the unknown figure of unofficial&#13;
(or illegal) migration is compensated by the number of returning migrants&#13;
(we shall call it Assumption 1). Alternatively, we shall assume that the&#13;
actual net migration in these years is 10 percent higher than the official&#13;
figure for gross migration (Assumption 2). We thus have the following two&#13;
alternative estimates of the net 'effective' addition to the stock of&#13;
Bangladeshi emigrants in the Middle East between the full years of&#13;
1976 and 1979:&#13;
Assumption 1           56.0 thousand&#13;
Assumption 2  :        61.6 thousand.&#13;
Matching these figures against the estimated annual remittance of Tk.2209.5&#13;
million, we have the following estimates of monthly remittance per worker&#13;
from the Middle East :&#13;
Assumption 1  :        Tk.3,545&#13;
Assumption 2  :        Tk.3.223.&#13;
7.12       Alternative estimates of remittance can also be made using data from&#13;
other sources. One such source is the household expenditure survey&#13;
conducted by Rizwanul Islam (see Chapter III). He t,ives figures for&#13;
monthly remittance received per family of migrants both for rural and&#13;
urban areas. Within the rural and urban areas, random sampling was used&#13;
so that the results can be taken to be representative for each area.&#13;
The national estimate of per family remittance can be derived by weighting&#13;
the rural and urban figures in the ratio of 78:22; this ratio corresponds&#13;
to the rural-urban origin of migrants as found in the BMET sample&#13;
survey (Chapter I). Since the survey was conducted in mid-1979, the&#13;
estimated remittance corresponds to the migrants' earnings level in&#13;
that year. We thus have the following estimates of the average monthly&#13;
remittance received per family in 1979:&#13;
Rural       Tk.4,036&#13;
Urban        Tk.3,927&#13;
National    Tk.4,013.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 198 -&#13;
It may be noted, however, that the above value of remittance is at the&#13;
exchange rate: prevailing under the Wage Earnerst Scheme. By using the&#13;
WES premium rate of 29 percent (average for January-July, 1979), we&#13;
therefore deflate the above estimate of remittance per family to arrive&#13;
at a figure of Taka 3,111 at the official exchange rate.&#13;
7. 13    It- may be noted at this stage that the migrant workers'&#13;
earnings abroad vary considerably over different skill-categories so&#13;
that the average level of remittance per worker is significantly affected&#13;
by the skill distribution among migrants. Table 7.2 shows two separate&#13;
estimates of the breakdown of emigrants by categories of skill, one from&#13;
Rizwanul Islam's household survey data and the other from official macro-level&#13;
data. The latter estiimate is taken from the Draft Second Five-Year Plan&#13;
and is based on BMET records of migrants for the period from 1976 to 1979.&#13;
Rizwanul Islam reports skillwise breakdown of emigrants for rural and urban&#13;
areas separately. 'de have obtained the combined national estimates by&#13;
weighting these in the ratio of 78:22 which is the proportion of rural-urban&#13;
origin of migrants as found in the BMEIT sample survey based on the data for&#13;
1977 and 1978 (see chapter I).&#13;

7.14     We now proceed to estimate remittance per worker according to skill&#13;
categories. The estimated level of migrants' savings abroad can be taken to&#13;
represent the amount of potentially remittable funds. The estimates of actual&#13;
remittance can then be checked against such estimates of potential remittance.&#13;
Anwar Hossain has used the same data in Chapter I, but his skill&#13;
classification is somewhat different from the one followed by the&#13;
Planning Commission and adopted by us. Thus, we include nurses, paramedics,&#13;
typists, clerks, etc., in the group we call technical and sub-professional&#13;
rather than in the professional group. This we do on the consideration of&#13;
comparability in the levels of earnings. Also, we find it convenient for&#13;
our analysis to treat semi-skilled and unskilled workers in the same&#13;
category.&#13;

Based on a sample of 189 returning migrants during early 1979, Ashraf&#13;
Ali reports the frequency distribution of migrants according to the&#13;
range of monthly savings of the migrants in the Middle East (see Table&#13;
7.3 below).&#13;

From the above table, it is not possible to estimate directly the average&#13;
level of savings for the entire sample or according to the skill categories&#13;
of workers. We have however attempted an indirect estimation of saving&#13;
according to skill categories by using the technique of interpolation.&#13;
Ashraf Ali reports the distribution of migrants in his sample according to&#13;
skill categories (Table 32, Appendix to Chapter II). We may reasonably assume&#13;
that the skill level and the level of earnings (and, therefore, the level of&#13;
savings) are positively related. On this assumption, the different skill&#13;
categories correspond to different ordinal saving groups as follows:  /&#13;
Ordinal saving groups&#13;
Semi-skilled and unskilled                        botton  70%o&#13;
Skilled                                                    7%  -  25%&#13;

Professional                                        ,t   53%  - 100%&#13;
7.15    We can now find the median level of savings for each skill category&#13;
by interpolation. Thus the savings level of the 16th from the bottom is the&#13;
median savings level for skilled workers and similarly for other groups.&#13;
The median saving of professionals (77th from the bottom) has to be estimated&#13;
by extrapolation. For the first category (i.e., unskilled workers), it is&#13;
difficult to apply this method and an estimate made otherwise - for example,&#13;
I It may be noticed at once that Ali's sample is quite unrepresentative so&#13;
far as the skillwise distribution of migrants is concerned; but this should&#13;
not be a problem for our estimation here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

by taking a proportion of the savings of skilled workers - may be more&#13;
appropriate. The estimated savings according to skill categories turns&#13;
out to be as follows:&#13;

These savings are presumably reported at the official exchange rate (i.e.,&#13;
Tk.15.5 = US$ 1). Using the skill composition of migrants as weights, the&#13;
estimated savings abroad per migrant in the Middle East is Tk.3,200 per&#13;
month. I/ However, there may be a downward bias in the amount of savings&#13;
reported by the migrants particularly if a part of such savings is remitted&#13;
through unofficial channels.(If so, the reported savings should correspond&#13;
more to actual official remittance than to entire savings.)&#13;
7.16     Ashraf Ali also reports the distribution of migrants according to&#13;
migrants' expenditure abroad (Table 35, Appendix to Chapter II). By using&#13;
similar method as in the case of savings, we can again estimate migrants'&#13;
expenditure abroad skill-categorywise. We can then look at the implied&#13;
monthly earnings of the migrants by adding their savings and expenditure&#13;
abroad. These turn out to be implausibly low given all other alternative&#13;
information about migrants' earnings. This seems to confirm our suspicion&#13;
about the possible downward bias in the reported savings. An indirect&#13;
estimate of savings can now be attempted on the basis of independent&#13;
estimates of migrants' income abroad along with the estimated expenditure&#13;
of migrants as obtained above. Anwar Hossain reports the range of salary&#13;
which is used as the basis of negotiations for job contracts in the Middle&#13;
East (Chapter I). We have considered the mid-point of this range for each&#13;
skill category as the possible average of actual earnings. We have also&#13;
considered the occupationwise salary structure in the Middle Eastern countries&#13;
as reported by Siddiqui (Table 61, Appendix to Chapter VIII). Taking all&#13;
these into consideration, we arrive at the set of estimates presented in&#13;
Table 7.4. 2/&#13;
j See Table 7.2; the estimate based on macro-data.&#13;
2jWe are considering here-:monetary income and expenditure alone. Besides salary&#13;
professional and technical workers are provided free accommodation and&#13;
skilled and unskilled workers get both free accommodation and food; see&#13;
Chapter I. Ashraf Ali's estimate of migrants  expenditute presumably exclude&#13;
the above benefits in kind. Ali also reports the average income of his&#13;
sample of migrants by s4ill category and the distribution of the migrants&#13;
according to income groups;Table 31 and 34, Appendix to Chapter II. These&#13;
income levels are far too high (making his savings and expenditure figures&#13;
combined all the more inconsistent with the reported income levels) and&#13;
probably include the money value of benefits in kind. We have, however,&#13;
igaored Ali'F all income figures in our estimates.&#13;

From Macro-data:&#13;

Higher Estimate                         Tk.3,820    "&#13;
7.18    All the above estimates are comfortably close to each other. There&#13;
is thus little support from these estimates about the alleged differential&#13;
between the potentially remittable fund and the actual remittance. In fact,&#13;
it is the proximity rather than the differential between the two that is&#13;
really intriguing. Of the two estimates of potential remittance, we would&#13;
prefer the higher one, for otherwise there would be virtually no gap between&#13;
the estimated potential and actual remittance to allow for some unofficial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

transfer of funds and migrants' propensity to retain some savings abroad.&#13;
On the side of actual remittance, the lower estimate obtained from the&#13;
macro-level data seems more acceptable since it is supported by evidence&#13;
from the household survey data. j One would in fact expect the estimate based&#13;
on household remittance data to be higher than the one based on the official&#13;
macro-date since the latter excludes any unofficial remittance. Here again,&#13;
there maybe a bias against disclosing unofficial methods of remittance so&#13;
that the surveyed households may have divulged information on official&#13;
remittance only,&#13;
T The estimates of actual remittance (from both macro-data and&#13;
household survey data) exclude goods imported by returning or&#13;
visiting migrants under the personal baggage rules and are&#13;
to that extent lower than the total value of remittance.&#13;

C. Direct Cost of Emnirration: Productivity Loss and Cost of Training&#13;
7.19    The most important direct cost of emigration is the loss of&#13;
domestic production as a consequence of loss of manpower. The issue&#13;
of how to measure the loss of domestic production is, however, fraught&#13;
with a number of conceptual and empirical complexities. The measure of&#13;
loss usually adopted varies depending on the type of worker emigrating.&#13;
In the case of an unskilled labourer, the output foregone may be assumed&#13;
equal to the marginal product of labour in agriculture, in keeping with&#13;
the premises of the 'surplus labour, dual economy' models. For skilled&#13;
workers it is argued that only the cost of obtaining a replacement, and&#13;
not the marginal product of the emigrating worker himself, should be&#13;
counted as the relevant cost. j/ The argument runs as follows: as a&#13;
skilled labourer emigrates, a replacement can always be found from the&#13;
pool of unemployed and underemployed workers so that the marginal product&#13;
of the emigrating worker is not lost to the society in the ultimate sense.&#13;
The society, however, does incur some costs in so far as (i) the marginal&#13;
output of the replacement worker in his earlier occupation is lost to the&#13;
society, (ii) resources are used up in training the replacement to bring&#13;
him up to the desired skill level,and (iii) output is either lost or&#13;
reduced during the period of training. It is thus argued that these three&#13;
elements of cost rather than the marginal product of the emigrating worker&#13;
constitute the direct cost of emigration of a skilled worker.&#13;
7.20    But the validity of this argument depends on certain implicit&#13;
assumptions about the nature of the particular labour market. If the&#13;
skill formation usually takes place through a process of informal or&#13;
on-job training then the argument is certainly valid. On the departure&#13;
of the emigrating worker, the employer finds an unskilled replacement, who&#13;
is always available, and then trains him up. The cost in this case is&#13;
obviously the three costs of replacement enumerated above.&#13;
7. 21    But if training is obtained formally prior to employment, the&#13;
argument will be valid only if training facilities are being consciously&#13;
created to meet the anticipated demand for replacement resulting from&#13;
emigration. For only in this case one would say that emigration generates&#13;
forces of its own replacement, so that it is the cost of obtaining the&#13;
replacement that matters. But if the extent or nature of training&#13;
activities is not affected by the existence of emigration, then the cost&#13;
of training is no longer the relevant cost of emigration. It is a sunk&#13;
cost to the society which would have been incurred regardless of whether&#13;
emigration took place or not. Would then the marginal product of the&#13;
/ See, for example, Guisinger, S., "A Framework for Assessing Benefits&#13;
and Costs in International Labour Migration", mimeo,1979 and Lucas,&#13;
R., "International Migration: Economic Causes, Consequences, Evaluation&#13;
and Policies", Boston University, mimeo, 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 204 -&#13;
emigrating worker be the relevant cost here ? That again will depend&#13;
on whether the market is demand-constrained or supply-constrained. If&#13;
demand is the dominant constraint so that a fair proportion of the&#13;
trained people always remain unemployed (in addition to the usual&#13;
frictional unemployment), then migration does not entail any loss of&#13;
output at all. Employment of a replacement worker simply reduces the&#13;
pool of the unemployed. As a result, the marginal output of the&#13;
emigrating worker is recovered without curtailing output anywhere&#13;
(and also the cost of training the replacement is in any case a sunk&#13;
cost). So there is no cost at all. j But if on the other hand the&#13;
market is supply-constrained, the replacement can be obtained only by&#13;
cutting down employment and output elsewhere. The relevant cost here is&#13;
obviously the marginal output of a worker in the concerned labour market.&#13;
7. 22    Thus depending on the nature of the labour market, the direct&#13;
cost of emigration of a skilled worker can be any one of the following&#13;
three:   the marginal product of the emigrating worker, the cost of&#13;
training the replacement or simply nil. It should be remembered that in&#13;
an ultimate sense the relevant cost is always the cost of replacement;&#13;
only its measure varies depending on the particular characteristics of&#13;
the labour market concerned. The relevant considerations are (i) whether&#13;
training is on-job or formal, (ii) whether training facilities are being&#13;
developed in anticipation of future demand arising out of emigration and&#13;
(iii) whether the market is supply-constrained or demand-constrained. We&#13;
shall now look into the structure of labour market in Bangladesh for&#13;
different skill-categories of workers and try to estimate the direct cost&#13;
of their emigration on the basis of the preceding analysis.&#13;
Unskilled Workers&#13;
7.23     The category of unskilled workers is taken here to include both&#13;
agricultural labourers and workers in the urban informal sector, in&#13;
addition to the unskilled workers in the modern sector. The social&#13;
opportunity cost of an unskilled labourer is generally measured by the&#13;
cost of withdrawing labour from agriculture which in turn is usually&#13;
assumed to be nil in a labour-surplus economy. The first part of this&#13;
premise is based on a presumed rural-urban nexus whereby any demand for&#13;
an additional unskilled labourer in the urban sector is assumed to be met&#13;
eventually by migration of a rural worker to the urban area. The social&#13;
cost of such migration, measured by the loss of output in agriculture, is&#13;
believed to be zero because of the presumed existence of surplus labour in&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
I/ The private valuation of such training can still be positive because&#13;
of (i) the work-sharing type of underemployment among the self-employed&#13;
and (ii) the subsidisation of the training facilities by the government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 205 -&#13;
7,24     But these premises are not universally accepted. In the&#13;
specific case of Bangladesh at least one study has argued that surplus&#13;
labour in Bangladesh agriculture is a purely seasonal phenomenon and&#13;
any permanent withdrawal of labour is likely to reduce agricultural&#13;
output. 21 As for the presumed rural-urban nexus, a recent study at the&#13;
Boston University suggests that this nexus, if it at all exists, is&#13;
very weak at the moment because of a large overhang of migrants from&#13;
rural areas already looking for jobs in the urban centres. 2 The&#13;
implication of the. latter position is that the opportunity cost of an&#13;
unskilled labourer in the urban sector cannot be measured by the loss&#13;
of output in agriculture resulting from migration to the urban area;&#13;
and the former position implies that even if the "loss of output in&#13;
agriculture" were a valid measure, the value of this measure would not&#13;
be zero. The thesis of zero opportunity cost of labour is thus doubly&#13;
threatened.&#13;
7.25     But Muqtada's methodology has been questioned, and by using a&#13;
different methodology, the same set of data has been shown to reveal a&#13;
withdrawal surplus. _3/ Moreover, Ahmad 4/ and Masum ./ have shown in&#13;
two independent studies that underemployment in Bangladesh agriculture&#13;
represents a structural surplus although Masum's estimate of surplus is&#13;
very much on the low side. The relative strength of evidence thus suggests&#13;
that the opportunity cost of withdrawing labour from Bangladesh agriculture&#13;
is indeed zero.&#13;

- 206 -&#13;
7.26     The Boston study I/ would, however, argue that in the&#13;
context of emigration of an unskilled worker from the urban area,&#13;
existence of surplus in agriculture is not a relevant factor in&#13;
the present state of migrants' overhang in urban Bangladesh. We&#13;
have two observations to make regarding this thesis. First, although&#13;
rural-urban migration did take place at an unprecedented rate in the&#13;
early seventies, there is no demographic evidence that the overhang&#13;
created thereby still exerts a dampening effect on further migration.&#13;
In fact, casual empiricism would suggest the contrary. Secondly, even&#13;
if one accepts the thesis of a weak rural-urban nexus and thus accepts&#13;
the irrelevance of surplus labour in agriculture, it does not follow&#13;
that the opportunity cost of an urban unskilled. worker must be positive.&#13;
The Boston study argues that the wage rate in the most competitiva segment&#13;
of the urban informal sector should be accepted as the relevant opportunity&#13;
cost. This seems to be a rather curious argument specially in view of the&#13;
explicit recognition of the existence of migrants' overhang in the urban&#13;
areas. Such an overhang would normally be expected to imply work-sharing&#13;
underemployment and very low earnings. The withdrawal of a worker under&#13;
these conditions would only mean that the remaining workers will be more&#13;
fully employed, thus preventing any loss of output to the society. The&#13;
competitiveness of urban labour markets and the existence of a positive&#13;
wage rate are not relevant considerations at all. Just as in the case of&#13;
agriculture, what matters is whether there exists a withdrawable surplus.&#13;
It is difficult to give a definitive answer to this question, as the&#13;
operation of the urban informal sector in Bangladesh is still very much a&#13;
virgin territory for our researchers. However, if casual empiricism is&#13;
any guide, we would assume that the labourers engaged in portering in the&#13;
urban Kutcha Bazar (which the Boston study indentifies as the most&#13;
competitive segment of the urban labour market) are substantially&#13;
underemployed. Thus regardless of whether an unskilled worker is assumed&#13;
to emigrate to the Middle East from the rural or urban area, we would&#13;
assume that it does not entail any loss of domestic production.&#13;
Semi-skilled Workers&#13;
7.27     Semi-skilled workers are demanded mostly in the formal sector,&#13;
and their skill acquisition takes place largely through on-job training&#13;
as an apprentice. Such workers are not in potentially short supply, as it&#13;
takes very little time for an unskilled labourer to acquire the status&#13;
of a semi-skilled one 2/ and there exists a large pool of unemployed and&#13;
underemployed unskilled labourers. The withdrawal of a semi-skilled&#13;
worker would not therefore result in a direct loss of production. Only&#13;
the cost of training(including the partial loss of output during the&#13;
period of training) and the opportunity cost of unskilled labour would&#13;
thus be the relevant cost of emigration. But the predominance of on-job&#13;
training implies that direct cost in training is virtually nil,&#13;
j Farashuddin, M. et al., 2p. cit.&#13;
/ Half a year on the average according to a survey carried out&#13;
by the Boston study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 207 -&#13;
and the opportunity cost of unskilled labour has already been argued&#13;
to be zero. Thus the only relevant cost is the partial loss of output&#13;
during the period of training.&#13;
7.28     The Boston study referred to earlier has shown that apprentice&#13;
workers in the industrial units are paid 50% of the regular pay during&#13;
the period of training. On this basis, it argues, and quite rightly so&#13;
in our judgement, that the other 50%, is the private valuation of loss of&#13;
output during this period. The annual equivalent of this indirect cost&#13;
of training can be estimated by using an appropriate capital recovery&#13;
factor to take into account the fact that the cost will be amortized over&#13;
the working lifetime of the worker. j However, if we accept the assumptions&#13;
of the Boston study that the period of apprenticeship for a semi-skilled&#13;
labourer is less than a year and that his working lifetime is about 35&#13;
years, the annual cost is likely to be quite negligible so that we can&#13;
ignore it for our purpose.&#13;
Skilled Workers&#13;
7.29     This category of workers also generally acquire their skill&#13;
through the process of on-job training, although quite a few technical&#13;
institutes are available to offer formal training. Relative to demand&#13;
these training facilities are not potentially in short supply, as is&#13;
evidenced by the existence of widespread under-utilized capacity in the&#13;
training institutes. 2 Additional demand for such category of workers&#13;
arising from emigration to the Middle East can thus be met for quite some&#13;
time without incurring any additional capital cost. Only the recurring costs&#13;
of a few types would then be the cost of emigration to the extent that&#13;
replacements are obtained by encouraging additional enrolment in the formal&#13;
training institutes. However, in view of the preponderance of on-job&#13;
training as the means of skill formation, we shall ignore the recurring&#13;
costs of these institutes and equate the cost of a skilled wo±ker with the&#13;
cost of acquiring such a worker through on-job training.&#13;
(.30     By an argument analoguous to the one made in the context of semi-&#13;
skilled workers, the only relevant cost is the partial loss of output&#13;
during the time taken by an apprentice to become a skilled worker. According&#13;
to the Boston Study, the period of apprenticeship for skilled workers is&#13;
on the average 3 years during which time the worker is paid 50 percent less&#13;
than the full salary in the first year, 40% less in the second year and&#13;
1/It is implicitly assumed that after the emigrating worker returns home,&#13;
there is no redundancy in the particular skills concerned so that all&#13;
skilled workers including the returning migrants can be gainfully&#13;
employed. Otherwise, the cost of training the replacement has to be&#13;
amortized only over the period during which the emigrating worker stays&#13;
abroad.&#13;

Research on Human Resource Development, Dacca, 1979.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 208 -&#13;
300 less in the third year. Taking a monthly salary of Tk.850 for&#13;
skilled workers, L/ the total value of output forgone during the&#13;
training period can be taken to be Tk.12,240. Applying a capital&#13;
recovery factor of .07 (as estimated in the Boston study), the annual&#13;
cost turns out to be Tk.857.&#13;
Professionals and Technicians&#13;
7. 31    Unlike the other categories of workers, professionals and&#13;
technicians are generally recognised to be in short supply relative&#13;
to demand, and they acquire skill mostly through formal training. We&#13;
have argued earlier that if training facilities are developed to meet&#13;
anticipated higher demand arising from emigration, then the cost of&#13;
expanding these facilities is the relevant cost of emigration. But this&#13;
does not seem to be the case in Bangladesh because of the lack of&#13;
articulation between the educational system and the labour market which&#13;
leads to very long lags between changes in demand for and changes in&#13;
production of professionals. v As a result, additional demand for&#13;
professionals confronts virtually zero elasticity of demand. Consequently,&#13;
the opportunity cost of a professional worker would be measured by his&#13;
marginal product. For technical workers in certain occupations, there may&#13;
be some imperfect substitution if replacements can be found from among&#13;
skilled workers. 3/ On the other hand, we should also take into account&#13;
that there may exist complementarities among different skill categories&#13;
of workers so that the emigration of a technical or professional worker&#13;
may have a more significant impact on reduced output than the marginal&#13;
product of the emigrant, narrowly defined, would convey. v&#13;
7.32     It is extremely difficult to come by any reasonable estimate of&#13;
the marginal product of a professional or technical worker, however&#13;
defined. In Bangladesh, most professional and technical workers are&#13;
employed either in the government or in the public corporate sector.&#13;
S The estimate of the average monthly wage for different categories of&#13;
workers are discussed later.&#13;
See Farashuddin, M., et al., op. cit.&#13;
3/ In this case, the loss of output due to imperfect substitution&#13;
and the opportunity cost of the replacement worker in his&#13;
original trade would together constitute the cost of emigration.&#13;
/ See Guisinger, S., Qa.cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 209 -&#13;
The scarcity factor in different professions does not play an&#13;
important role in the determination of salaries in the public sector.&#13;
Also, considerable wage differentials exist between the public and&#13;
private sectors. At this stage, we can perhaps do no better than&#13;
make some reasonable guesses. Thus we shall assume that the opportunity&#13;
cost is 25 percent higher than the average earning level for professionals&#13;
and 15 percent higher for sub-professionals and technicians. The estimation&#13;
of the average earning levels for different categories of workers will be&#13;
discussed later.&#13;

D. ImPact of Remittance on Income and Consumption of Migrants' Families&#13;
7.33     The difference between the value of remittance and the loss of&#13;
domestic output is the net gain to the society resulting from emigration.&#13;
This additional flow of resources can be either saved or consumed. If&#13;
there is a premium on savings in the economy, as seems likely to be the&#13;
case in Bangladesh, the part of additional resource flow that supports&#13;
increased consumption should be assigned a lower social value relative&#13;
to savings. Also, if different distributional weights are to be assigned&#13;
to the consumption of different income groups, the social value of&#13;
increased consumption would depend on the income distributional&#13;
consequences of migration. To assess the social costs and benefits of&#13;
migration, we have to therefore look at the effects of remittance money&#13;
on the income and consumption levels of migrants' families. 1/&#13;
7.34     To analyse the distributional consequences of migration, it is&#13;
important to know the income levels of migrants' families both before and&#13;
after migration. The household survey of Rizwanul Islam (Chapter III)&#13;
can give us information on the income of migrants' families after migration,&#13;
but there is no direct information on income before migration. Ashraf Ali&#13;
reports the previous income level of his sample of returning migrants,&#13;
but his estimates are unreliable for the skilled and unskilled categories&#13;
of workers because of too few observations (Table 31, Appendix to Chapter&#13;
II). We, however, accept Ali's figures for professional and technical&#13;
workers and assume that these correspond, on the average, to the level of&#13;
mid-1977. 2/ We arrive at the 1979 income levels by adjusting these for&#13;
an estimated 15 percent general inflation rate in the economy between 1977&#13;
and 1979.&#13;
7.35     For skilled and unskilled workers, the Bangladesh Bureau of&#13;
Statistics (BBS) regularly reports the daily wage rates in agriculture,&#13;
construction and different manufacturing industries. For July 1979, the&#13;
monthly wage of a skilled labourer varies from Tk.420 to Tk.480 in most&#13;
manufacturing industries, but is much higher for' engineering industries&#13;
(Tk.716) and construction (Tk.937). For an unskilled labourer, the wage&#13;
rate varies from Tk.330 to Tk.488 across the economy.&#13;
It should be remembered, at this stage, that the emigration of&#13;
workers may affect the income and consumption of other families&#13;
as well by creating additional employment or by raising the wage&#13;
level. This has to be taken into account while estimating the net&#13;
increase in consumption due to emigration.&#13;
Ali's survey was conducted in early 1979 and the respondents, on&#13;
the average, reported that they had been in the Middle East for&#13;
y1 years.&#13;
See the different issues of the Nlonthly Statistical Bulletin of&#13;
Bangladesh.&#13;

An alternative estimate can be obtained from the results of a 1976-77&#13;
survey conducted by the authors of the Boston study discussed earlier.&#13;
After adjusting for the increase in the general wage level, j/ the&#13;
estimated monthly wage in 1979 is Tk.777 and Tk.534 for a skilled and&#13;
an unskilled labourer respectively.    The estimates by the Boston study&#13;
includes fringe benefits and other benefits in kind while these are&#13;
possibly excluded in the wage rates reported by the BBS. We have also&#13;
considered that the better-paid may have a higher chance of getting&#13;
employment abroad. Taking all this into account, we may finally accept&#13;
the following figures for monthly earnings of prospective emigrants in&#13;
Bangladesh (at the 1979 level of earnings):&#13;
Previous Income of IMigrants&#13;
Professional                     Tk.2,360 monthly&#13;
Sub-professional and&#13;
technical                        Tk.1,450   tt&#13;
Skilled                          Tk. 850    "&#13;
Semi-skilled and unskilled       Tk.  500    "&#13;
We now proceed to estimate the total family income of prospective&#13;
migrants before migration. Households may have more than one earning memaber&#13;
and may have non-wage sources of income. For professiOnal and technical&#13;
groups, we assume that the migrants are the heads of respective families.&#13;
The results of the 1976-77 household expenditure survey of the Bangladesh&#13;
Bureau of Statistics show the proportion of household income contributed&#13;
by the head of the family in different household income groups. g/ We&#13;
have considered this proportion for the relevant household income groups&#13;
for both rural and urban areas to estimate the percentage contribution of&#13;
prospective migrants to their family's income according to the skill categories.&#13;
7.36     For skilled and unskilled workers, we have estimated a range of&#13;
family income. The lower estimate is obtained in the same way as described&#13;
above. The higher estimate is based on the assumption that the migrant can be&#13;
any one of the earning members (and not necessarily the head) of the family.&#13;
In this case we have used the average number of earners per family (again in&#13;
the appropriate household income range and after appropriately weighting&#13;
the rural and urban figures) to blow up the migrants' individual earning.&#13;
j The BBS general wage index for July 1979 with 1976-77 as the base&#13;
is used.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 212 -&#13;
-e thus have the following estimates of family income:&#13;
Previous Monthly Income of Migrants' Family&#13;
at the 1979 Level of Earnings&#13;
Professional                                   Tk.2,645&#13;
Sub-professional and technical                 Tk.1,668&#13;
Skilled                                        Tk.977 - Tk.1,445&#13;
Semi-skilled and unskilled                     Tk.565 - Tk.  850&#13;
7.37     As for family income after migration, Rizwanul Islam's survey&#13;
provides information for various income groups, whereas we need information&#13;
according to the various categories of workers. However, Islam's study&#13;
also provides information on the proportion between the remittance and&#13;
non-remittance components of income according to household income groups.&#13;
We can apply this proportion between the two sources of income (for the&#13;
relevant income groups) to our previously estimated remittance per&#13;
migrant to get an estimate of the total income of the migrant's family.&#13;
For this exercise, we take the lower estimate of potential remittance per&#13;
worker as estimated from Ashraf Ali's survey findings. We have chosen the&#13;
lower estimate of potential remittance because the implied per worker&#13;
remittance (weighted for all skill categories) is very close to our&#13;
estimates of actual remittance per worker.&#13;
7.38     To consider the income of migrants' family, the remittance has&#13;
to be first valued at the premium rate of exchange prevailing in the Wage&#13;
Earners' Scheme market. Total family income corresponding to the level of&#13;
remittance for each skill-category   of migrants is then estimated for both&#13;
rural and urban households. Finally,the estimates of rural and urban family&#13;
income for each category of migrants are weighted by the rural-urban&#13;
proportion of such migrants to get the national estimates. These estimates&#13;
are presented in Table 7.5.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 213 -&#13;
7.39     It is interesting to compare the above estimates of income&#13;
of migrants' family after migration with our earlier estimates of&#13;
income of the prospective migrant and his family before migration. It is&#13;
clear that the value of remittance is many-fold higher than the migrant's&#13;
previous income. Emigration thus has the capacity to create a class of&#13;
new elites by causing migrants' families to jump several rungs of the&#13;
income ladder all at a time. We may also notice the rather high level of&#13;
non-remittance income of the migrants' families as shown in Table 7.5.&#13;
If we assume that the previous earning of the emigrant is lost to the&#13;
family after he emigrates, the non-remittance part of income should, in&#13;
principle, correspond to the difference between the previous income of&#13;
the emigrant and that of his family which we estimated earlier. That this&#13;
is not so may suggest any Or all of the following: (i) the generally held&#13;
belief that migrants come from more affluent background compared to other&#13;
workers in the same skill-category; (ii) that the migrants' families have&#13;
acquired income-yielding assets by using remittance; and (iii) that there&#13;
is a systematic bias for over-reporting of non-remittance income in&#13;
Rizwanul Islam's survey. Given the large discrepancy, probably all these&#13;
factors are true to some extent.&#13;
7.40     Besides the income of emigrants' families, one also needs&#13;
information on the average level of income (or consumption) in the&#13;
economy in order to be able to assign appropriate distributional weights.&#13;
The 1976-77 Household Expenditure Survey conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau&#13;
of Statistics provides information on average household income in 1976-77&#13;
for rural and urban areas. The percentage increase in GNP at current prices&#13;
between 1976-77 and 1978-79 is applied to these figures to arrive at the&#13;
estimate of average household income in 1979 for rural and urban areas.&#13;
The national estimate is derived by weighting the rural and urban figures&#13;
in the proportion of 9:1. Thus, for 1978-79, we have the following&#13;
estimates of average income per household:&#13;
Rural :    Tk.844 monthly&#13;
Urban :    Tk.1,290  "&#13;
National: Tk. 888 "&#13;
7. 41    An alternative estimate of average household income in 1978-79&#13;
can be obtained directly fxom the official national income statistics. ./&#13;
The two alternative estimates of average household income are compatible,&#13;
particularly if we consider the different methodology of estimating&#13;
agricultural output in the BBS Survey and in the national income statistics&#13;
(the former uses retail prices which are higher than the harvest prices&#13;
used by the latter).&#13;
2/This estimate turns out to be Tk.754 per month.&#13;
An average family size of 5.6 is assumed on the basis of the BBS&#13;
1976-77 Household Survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 214 -&#13;
7. 42    It can be seen that even for the categories of unskilled workers,&#13;
the estimated amount of remittance is more than 3 times larger than the&#13;
average household income in the economy. Also, the estimated previous&#13;
income of the migrant's family lies well above the average household income&#13;
in the economy for all categories of migrants except unskilled workers. j/&#13;
We may also recall that our estimates of previous income of migrants' families&#13;
are probably on the lower side as indicated by Rizwanul Islam's survey&#13;
findings. The weight of evidence thus supports the hypothesis that emigration&#13;
is helping only the better-off families to move further up in the income&#13;
scale. In contrast, the poorer households do not appear to have benefitted&#13;
much from emigration.&#13;
7. 43    The household income-expenditure survey of Rizwanul Islam provides&#13;
information on the savings behaviour of households receiving remittances&#13;
from abroad in comparison with households not receiving such remittances.&#13;
The data from the survey are available in respect of rural and urban&#13;
households separately. The estimates of marginal and average savings rates&#13;
presented in Tables 7.6A-7.6D are based on the survey findingsreported by&#13;
Rizwanul Islam (see Chapter III).&#13;

1/Even for unskilled workers, our estimate of the previous income of the&#13;
migrant's family would seem quite high in relation to the average&#13;
household income. This is not surprising since in our estimate of&#13;
unskilled workers' previous income, we considered the wage earned by&#13;
the better-paid workers and also assumed that the workers were employed&#13;
for 30 days in a month. There is, however, considerable underemployment&#13;
among unskilled workers both in agriculture and in the urban informal&#13;
sector in Bangladesh.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 216 -&#13;
7.44     A consistent and systematic pattern of savings behaviour comes&#13;
out from the estimates presented in the above tables. Both average and&#13;
marginal saviags rates are higher for remittance-receiving households&#13;
than for other households. And this is true for both rural and urban&#13;
samples of households. The difference in the savings behaviour is quite&#13;
plausible behaviourally and can be explained by at least two factors. First,&#13;
since remittance income is like windfall gains, households receiving such&#13;
remittances are unlikely to consider these as a permanent source of&#13;
income. Second, since the emigrant worker (usually the head of the family)&#13;
is away, the total consumption of the migrant's family is likely to be&#13;
less than the consumption of other families at similar levels of household&#13;
income.&#13;
7.45     Let us now consider the net increase in both income and&#13;
consumption of the migrant's family resulting from emigration. (It may be&#13;
remembered that we do not here take into account the migrant's own&#13;
consumption abroad or any part of his income retained abroad .) This can be&#13;
better explained diagrammatically. In Fig. 7.1, the consumption curve for&#13;
households receiving remittances is denoted by C1 and for other households&#13;
by C2. As such, these can be taken as the consumption curve of the migrant's&#13;
family before and after migration. It may be noted that C1 indicates a&#13;
higher value of both average and marginal saving rates compared to C2.&#13;
C2&#13;
Consumption&#13;

Yl             Y2    ~~~~Income&#13;
Figure 7.1&#13;
Also, negative savings at lower income levels are implied by both the&#13;
curves. Let us take Yl to represent the previous level of income of the&#13;
migrant's family. The level of household consumption before emigration&#13;
is therefore given by the point A on the higher consumption curve. After&#13;
emigration, the income of the migrant's family is given by Y2; the net&#13;
increase in the income of the migrant's family (that is, Y2-y1) can be&#13;
taken to be the value of the remittance minus the loss of the emigrant's&#13;
previous income. The post-migration level of consumption is given by the&#13;
point B on the lower consumption curve (since emigration not only increases&#13;
income but also shifts the consumption curve of the migrant' s family).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 217 -&#13;
7.46     Following the above methodology, we can estimate the net&#13;
increase in the consumption of the migrant*s family in the case of&#13;
each skill categories of migrants. First, we take the pre-migration&#13;
level of income of the migrant's family estimated earlier. The&#13;
corresponding pre-migration level of consumption is estimated by applying&#13;
the savings rates as obtain in the case of households not receiving&#13;
remittances. (The amount of savings corresponding to given levels of&#13;
income can be estimated from Table 7.6A-D by applying the method of&#13;
interpolation.)The net increase in income of the migrant'sfamily is taken&#13;
as the difference between the value of remittance at the WES exchange rate&#13;
(see Table 7.5) and the estimated previous income of the migrant. The&#13;
post-migration level of income is obtained accordingly. The level of&#13;
consumption corresponding to post-migration income is estimated by applying&#13;
the savings rates of households receiving remittances (again by interpolation).&#13;
The exercise is done for rural and urban households separately (since the&#13;
savings estimates are different for rural and urban households). The&#13;
estimates of net increase in consumption for rural and urban households are&#13;
then weighted by the proportion of rural-urban origin of migrants in&#13;
different skill categories. V/&#13;

It would appear from the above estimates that about 60% to 70o of the net&#13;
increase in income is saved by emigrants' families.It should be remembered,&#13;
that these implied marginal savings rates incorporate the effect of the&#13;
j./The estimated rural-urban proportion of migrants are as follows:&#13;
professionals - 7% :~ 93%; sub-professionalsand technicians - 52%o : 48%;&#13;
skilled - 84%: 16%; and semi-skilled and unskilled - 80%   20%. These&#13;
estimates are based on Table 7.2,.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 218 -&#13;
shift in the consumption curve due to emigration as discussed earlier. 2.&#13;
7. 47    The social value of savings out of remitted money would also&#13;
depend on the way such savings are used. Savings are defined in Rizwanul&#13;
Islam's study so as to include, besides monetary savings, expenditure on&#13;
such items as consumer durables, land purchase, construction and&#13;
improvement of houses, repayment of debt and investment in agriculture,&#13;
industry or business. Of these items, expenditure on consumer durables&#13;
should be treated for our purpose as consumption rather than investment.&#13;
Expenditure on construction and improvement of houses (particularly,&#13;
construction of luxury houses) should also be assigned a lower social value&#13;
as compared to productive investment which contribute to the growth of&#13;
employment and labour productivity in the economy. The repayment of debt&#13;
and expenditure on land purchase are both transfer payments and the effect&#13;
of such expenditure has to be traced to the ultimate users of such funds.&#13;
The use of remittance money to purchase land is likely to raise the price&#13;
of land and benefit those who sell land. To the extent that the sellers&#13;
of land increase their consumption because of the higher price of land, a&#13;
part of migrant's expenditure on land purchase is, in effect, converted into&#13;
consumption.-     As regards direct investment by the migrant's family in&#13;
agriculture or in other productive sectors of the economy, this may be&#13;
assigned the same social value as uncommittedfunds for investment provided&#13;
such investment do not deviate from the socially desirable pattern of&#13;
investment allocation. Lastly, monetary savings in whatever form represent&#13;
'potential' funds for investment in the current period; but if the accumulated&#13;
funds are spent on consumption upon the return of the migrant, resources will&#13;
be drawn away from investment in a future period.&#13;
7. 48    Expenditure by the migrants' families on some of the items&#13;
discussed above can be estimated only very roughly on the basis of the&#13;
survey findings reported by Rizwanual Islam. Table 7.8 shows the estimated&#13;
average monthly expenditure by the remittance-receiving households on land&#13;
purchase, construction and improvement of houses and purchase of consumer&#13;
j/ Although these estimates are derived from Rizwanul Islam's survey&#13;
findings, his own estimates of "savings out of remittances" are&#13;
derived from questions concerning how much was spent on consumption&#13;
from remittance money see Table 3.26. This is rather a doubtful&#13;
methodology and can give misleading results particularly when there&#13;
are considerable dissavings at the pre-migration levels of income.&#13;
2/ If the sale of land is in the nature of distress sale by poorer&#13;
households, the increase in the price of land will mean that less&#13;
land has to be sold to meet the same level of subsistence consumption&#13;
(implying a backward-sloping supply curve in the land market). In this&#13;
case, no increase in consumption takes place.&#13;

that at the pre-migration level of income, the expenditure of the migrants'&#13;
families on these items is negligible, the entire amount of expenditure&#13;
shown in Table 7.8 can be taken to have resulted from remittances.&#13;

iI Rizwanul Islam reports the amount of money spent on these items during&#13;
the previous 5 years; Table 3.22 - 3.24. The average expenditure per&#13;
family can be estimated from these table.s for his rural and urban samples&#13;
of remittance-receiving households. Also, the average remittance received&#13;
per family during the previous 5 years can be estimated from Tables 3.31&#13;
- 3.33. (Unfortunately, only very rough estimates can be made since the&#13;
latter tables do not include information on all households). The&#13;
expenditure on different items is then estimated as a percentage of&#13;
remittance received during the previous 5 years. These percentages are&#13;
estimated for each skill categories of workers by appropriately weighting&#13;
the rural and urban estimates. The percentages are then applied to the&#13;
value of monthly remittance to estimate the average monthly expenditure&#13;
skill-categorywise on the different items of expenditure.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

7.49     Besides affecting the income and consumption of migrants4&#13;
families    the emigration of workers may have other indirect effects&#13;
on income and consumption in the economy. Unfortunately, not all such&#13;
indirect effects can be easily quantified. Some income effects are,&#13;
however, implied by the very logic of our analysis of the forgone&#13;
domestic output due to emigration. Thus, in the case of unskilled&#13;
workers, we have assumed that although the migrant's previous earning&#13;
is lost to his family, there is no corresponding loss of output in the&#13;
economy. In this case, the previous income of the migrant will probably&#13;
go to one or more of the underemployed workers who will now find more&#13;
employment. By the same logic, however, it can be argued that there would&#13;
be no rise in the wage rate consequent upon the emigration of unskilled&#13;
workers. In the case of emigration of a skilled worker, the net income gain&#13;
accruing to non-migrant workers would be equal to the new income of the&#13;
replacement worker. j/ For professional and technical workers, we have&#13;
argued that the loss of output would be higher than the income earned by&#13;
such workers; this additional loss would probably accrue to the owners of&#13;
capital.&#13;
j/ The previous income of the replacement worker will accrue to other&#13;
unskilled wof'kers through higher employment while the difference&#13;
between the previous and the new income of the replacement worker&#13;
will, of course, accrue to the replacement worker himself.&#13;

E. A Framework fori Cost-Benefit Analysis&#13;
7.50     The empirical significance of the components of benefits and&#13;
costs can now be brought together in a mumerical exercise to estimate&#13;
the magnitude of the net present value (NPV) derived from emigration.&#13;
In fact, several variants of such an exercise are made possible by the&#13;
existence of alternative estimates of many of the important variables.&#13;
We shall present here one such variant for each of the four categories&#13;
of workers. The exercise is preliminary in the sense that our knowledge&#13;
about the value of the variables is not yet well-founded and many of the&#13;
indirect costs and benefits remain to be quantified.&#13;
7.51     The numerical estimate of NPV relates to the case of benefits&#13;
and costs associated with the temporary migration of a Bangladeshi worker&#13;
to the Middle East. The net social benefit is estimated for each year of&#13;
the emigrant's stay abroad; the discounted sum of the net benefits over all&#13;
the years represents the NPV for emigration. The estimated NPV relates to&#13;
the welfare impact within the political boundaries of the country, that is,&#13;
it does not take into account overseas consumption of the emigrant. The&#13;
numer#Are (i.e., the unit of account) is taken to be uncommitted public income&#13;
measured in freely convertible currency or "free foreign exchange". Uncommitted&#13;
public income is taken here to represent resources for public investment and&#13;
no distinction is made between the value of investible resources available&#13;
to the public sector and to the private sector.&#13;
7.52     The estimated value of the relevant variables and parameters are&#13;
set in Table 7.9. The analysis of social costs and benefits corresponding&#13;
to one year of the emigrant's stay abroad is displayed in Table 7.10. The&#13;
first item of cost is the forgone output due to emigration. The value of&#13;
output forgone at domestic prices for each skill category   of workers has&#13;
already been discussed in a previous section. On the basis of the estimated&#13;
output conversion factor, this value is converted into value at border prices&#13;
(row 1, Table 7.10).&#13;
7.53     The increased consumption reduces the availability of resources for&#13;
investment so that it enters as a cost. However, increased consumption has a&#13;
social value depending on the relevant distribution weight. For reasons&#13;
discussed earlier expenditure on consumption-like investment such as&#13;
construction of houses and purchase of consumer durables is treated as&#13;
equivalent to consumption. The net increase in the consumption of the&#13;
migrant's family is estimated accordingly (see Tables 7.7 and 7.8). In the&#13;
case of skilled and unskilled categories of workers, we have to also take&#13;
into account the increased consumption of the families of workers not&#13;
emigrating (see our discussion in the previous section). It is assumed that&#13;
the marginal propensity to consume out of the increased income of non-migrant&#13;
workers is .7. The entry in row 10 of Table 7.9 is estimated accordingly. The&#13;
market value of increased consumption is converted into value at border&#13;
prices by using a consumption conversion factor (CCF) of .6.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 224 -&#13;
7.54     WAhen consumption is estimated as an item of social benefit, an&#13;
appropriate distribution weight has to be assigned to it. Unlike most&#13;
projects which effect income distribution only marginally, the&#13;
emigration of workers involves a substantial change in the income class&#13;
of the emigrant's family. It is not at all obvious whether the increased&#13;
consumption of emigrants' families should be assigned the distribution weight&#13;
of their previous consumption level or their new consumption level. As a&#13;
compromise, we shall use the average of the two distribution weights --&#13;
one related to the pre-migration level of consumption and the other related&#13;
to the post-migration level of consumption. The distribution weight for the&#13;
i-th category of migrants is estimated from the formula di = (c/ci)  where&#13;
n is the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, c is the average&#13;
consumption per household in the economy and ci is the consumption of the&#13;
families   of i-th category of migrants. The average consumption per&#13;
household in the economy is taken to be equal to our earlier estimate of&#13;
average income per household, that is, Taka 888 per month. The value of&#13;
n is set at unity.&#13;
7.55     The market value of consumption (multiplied by the distribution&#13;
weight) is expressed in terms of the numeraire by using a conversion factor&#13;
which is entered in row 8 of Table 7.9. This conversion factor measures&#13;
the value of private consumption at domestic prices(    at the average level&#13;
of consumption)relative to the numeraire. .3&#13;
7.56     The net present value (NPV) is estimated by assuming that the&#13;
migrant stays abroad for 4 years. The annual level of remittance is&#13;
assumed to be the same as our lower estimate of potential remittance&#13;
discussed earlier. The same flow of remittance and hence consumption is&#13;
assumed for each of the four years. A social discount rate of 8 per cent is&#13;
assumed to calculate the net present value. The estimated NPV's for each&#13;
category   of workers are shown in Table 7.11.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 225 -&#13;
7.57     It is clear that the net present value from emigration is&#13;
not only positive but also quite large. The most important factor in&#13;
attaining this level of net social benefits is the size of remittances,&#13;
which are in turn related to the level of overseas wages. We have not&#13;
however taken into account certain cost elements such as the psychological&#13;
costs of separation from the family or the dislocation costs arising&#13;
from a mass re-entry of migrants. But the statistical magnitude of such&#13;
cost components would hl e to be very large to reverse our finding of&#13;
sizeable net social gair from emigration. 1/&#13;

CHAPTER VIII&#13;
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PROMOTING&#13;
MANPOWER EXPORT 'FROM BANGLADESH&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
8.1       The rapid increase in the outflow of manpower from Bangladesh for&#13;
short-term employment, from about 6,000 in 1976 to approximately 23,000 in 1978,&#13;
is an indication of the opportunities that exist in the Middle Eastern countries&#13;
and that were missed by a lack of definite and clearcut policy towards export of&#13;
manpower until late 1975. Post-1975 measures helped eager job seekers and em-&#13;
ployers in search of new sources of cheap labour. Free service rendered by the&#13;
Government machinery and the enthusiasm with which such services were rendered in&#13;
initial years attracted unexpected numbers of employers. Compared with the similar&#13;
flow of manpower from other Asian countries, Bangladesh, with its substantially&#13;
increased outflow, still occupies one of the lowest positions and to maintain&#13;
even this low position she is in need of rationalising, strengthening, and stream-&#13;
lining the administrative and legal measures followed thus far to promote employ-&#13;
ment of her workers abroad. Equally urgent appears to be the necessity to attend&#13;
to the problems generated by a quick rise in the rate of outflow in a relatively&#13;
short period.&#13;
8.2       Bangladesh will need to develop an image of a reliable source of quality&#13;
manpower as opposed to that of a supplier of cheap labour. The confidence generated&#13;
in foreign countries in the ability of the Government machinery to handle speedy&#13;
and merit-based recruitment during 1976-78 will need to be established. A realistic&#13;
picture of job prospects will have to be projected to the job seekers at home so&#13;
as to prevent foreign employment opportunities from becoming a means of money&#13;
making, support seeking and patronage distribution. From the position of a sup-&#13;
plier of manpower, it will be essential to mature into that of a competitor for&#13;
construction and other projects, if the flow of manpower is to be accelerated.&#13;
8.3       In the past it has been a question of taking advantage of the opportunities&#13;
avjailable. In the 1980s however, the competition will be more severe because of&#13;
employers increasing preferrance for Far East Asian countries due to the demon-&#13;
strated ability of these countries to take full responsibility for technologically&#13;
complex projects in difficult working conditions. All supplying countries will&#13;
have to improve upon their past performance not only because of mutual competition&#13;
but also because of the emergence of the People's Republic of China as a potential&#13;
competitor. 1/ It must be admitted that Bangladesh does not possess any natural&#13;
advantage over her competitors. It is imperative therefore to develop and demon-&#13;
strate superior management ability in meeting the manpower requirement of Middle&#13;
Eastern and other countries.&#13;
1/   See Far Eastern Economic Review, 30 November 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 227 -&#13;
8.4       This will mean a drastic change in the attitude and practice of employers&#13;
in the public and private sectors in recruitment, training and utilisation of man-&#13;
power for their establishments. The nation's trainable reserve must be utilised&#13;
and the skills of the employed unskilled workers have to be upgraded. Adminis-&#13;
trative bottlenecks and lapses, reluctance to overcome temporary dislocation&#13;
through anticipatory measures and the current apathy to the need for proper selection&#13;
and training of manpower have to be removed.&#13;
8.5       Much more serious attention than has been paid hitherto, will be neces-&#13;
sary to formulate and implement an appropriate policy in this regard. This will&#13;
involve, among other things:&#13;
(a) Assessing the nature and characteristics of demand from abroad,&#13;
including countries other than those in the Middle East.&#13;
(b) Assessing the nature and characteristics of available manpower&#13;
at home in the context of the foreign demand for the purpose of&#13;
adopting a realistic target.&#13;
(c) Identifying training and retraining measures and implementing&#13;
them with a view to attaining the above target.&#13;
(d) Devising measures to prevent shortage at home while promoting&#13;
employment abroad.&#13;
(e) Promoting the demand for nationals, particularly those who are&#13;
surplus to the national requirement, in the overseas employment&#13;
market.&#13;
(f)  Tmplementing procedures for quick recruiting while ensuring the&#13;
quality demanded by foreign employers.&#13;
(g) Introducing educational programmes for prospective migrants.&#13;
(h) Adopting adequate safeguards to ensure fair working conditions in&#13;
countries of employment, including those for settlement of disputes.&#13;
(i)  Strengthening measures to maximize remittance and their productive&#13;
use.&#13;
(j) Promoting welfare measures for dependents of migrants.&#13;
(k) Streamlining procedures to redluce corrupt practices in recruitment,&#13;
departure and remittance of savings.&#13;
(1) Sponsoring measures for resettlement of migrants returning home&#13;
on completion of contract.&#13;
(m)  Defining unambiguously the role of the private and public sectors&#13;
in promoting and processing overseas employment.&#13;
(n) Instituting machinery to keep the situation under constant review&#13;
and study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 228 -&#13;
8.6       Whether or not Bangladesh should allow emigration of her nationals when&#13;
employment opportunities arise is not the principal question.  The question is&#13;
whether Bangladesh has the determination and capability to formulate and admin-&#13;
ister an appropriate emigration policy.&#13;
8.7       Here an attempt is made to analyse institutional and other problems&#13;
related to the export of manpower from Bangladesh, examine the future prospects&#13;
and possibilities of manpower export and suggest policy measures required to pro-&#13;
mote foreign employment of Bangladeshi workers in the 1980-1985 period.&#13;
B. Procedural Matters&#13;
8.8       Though a sharp difference in the attitude of the Government towards&#13;
foreign employment before and after 1975 is clearly discernible, the reasons for&#13;
such a substantial increase in manpower export from Bangladesh are not entirely&#13;
the Government efforts.       Other contributing factors are:&#13;
(a) Pre-independence migrants to Saudi Arabia and UAE and their&#13;
continuous efforts to promote the foreign employment of their&#13;
relations and friends.&#13;
(b) The policy of the manpower importing Governments to diversify&#13;
the source of manpower supply.&#13;
(c) Extraordinary enthusiasm of individual job seekers to secure&#13;
foreign employment.&#13;
(d)  Ever increasing demand for manpower in the labour importing&#13;
countries.&#13;
8.9       Government measures contributed significantly to the increase in the&#13;
flow of manpower, though such measures were not based on systematic assessments&#13;
of the cost and benefit of such migration.  This is not to suggest that the private&#13;
agents exporting labour had any notion of cost and benefit themselves.  The Govern-&#13;
ment measures also suffered from the usual weaknesses of the public administrative&#13;
machinery of a developing country. Some of the positive measures of the Government&#13;
are the following:&#13;
(a)  Posting labour attaches in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Qatar, Libya,&#13;
Iran and Kuwait in 1976.&#13;
(b)  Creation of the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training&#13;
(EMrET) in 1976, to undertaken among other things, processing&#13;
foreign labour demand, organising training for the foreign labour&#13;
market, promotional campaigns for foreign employment, maintaining&#13;
statistics, and regulating fair working standards for those pro-&#13;
cessed by private recruiters.&#13;
(c)  Providing facilities to private recruiters similar to those&#13;
available to exporters of commodities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 229 -&#13;
(d) Simplification of procedures for issue of passports and exit&#13;
for foreign employment.&#13;
(e)  Signing bilateral promotional agreements between the Government&#13;
of Bangladesh and the Governments in Iran, Iraq, and Libya.&#13;
(f)  Signing agency agreements between the Bureau of Manpower, flploy-&#13;
ment and Training and prominent foreign firms.&#13;
(g)  Sponsoring delegations of Government officials, private recruiters,&#13;
representatives of the Telephone and Telegraph Department, Works&#13;
Departments, and construction firms to the labour importing&#13;
countries.&#13;
(h)  Extending invitations to and receiving heads of foreign labour&#13;
ministries to visit Bangladesh.&#13;
(i) Arranging additional funds for training in establishments and&#13;
industries.&#13;
(j) Achieving a workable degree of coordination between the principal&#13;
Government agency (BMET) and other agencies like immigration and&#13;
passport, airlines and civil aviation, Bangladesh Bank and foreign&#13;
missions located in Dacca.&#13;
8.10      The major weaknesses in the measures undertaken by the Government are:&#13;
(a) Failure to present a realistic picture of job prospects to intended&#13;
migrants, resulting in overcrowding of applicants in categories&#13;
not in demand and non-availability of persons in categories in&#13;
high demand.&#13;
(b) Failure to adopt a uniform policy in the release of selected&#13;
applicants or in forwarding applications of prospective migrants&#13;
by major employers in the public and private sectors.&#13;
(c)  Failure to make available to the foreign recruiting tsams&#13;
suitable oremises for conducting tests and interviews and failure&#13;
to control the number of interviewees and their occasional un-&#13;
rulv behaviour, Darticularly during recruitment of unskilled&#13;
workers.&#13;
(d) Inadequate arrangements for maintenance of records of applicants.&#13;
(e) Inadequate financial, manpower and physical resources at the dis-&#13;
posal of the principal agency (EMET) dealing with the task.&#13;
(f) Lack of uniform practice in respect to processing and handling&#13;
of labour recruitment by foreign missions located in Bangladesh.&#13;
(g) Absence of a clearcut policy regarding the export of certain&#13;
skill categories like medical personnel, Power Board employees,&#13;
etc. for foreign employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 230 -&#13;
(h)  Absence of any safeguard against non-fulfillment of promised re-&#13;
cruitment by foreign Enployers.&#13;
(i)  Absence of any safeguard against non-fulfillment of contractual&#13;
obligations by foreign employers.&#13;
(j)  Inadequate efforts towards procuring demand for surplus categories&#13;
of skills.&#13;
(k) Absence of briefing arrangements for prospective migrants.&#13;
(1) Absence of institutional measures for welfare of migrants and&#13;
their dependents.,&#13;
(m)  Cumbersome procedures to regulate the activities of the private&#13;
recruiters.&#13;
(n) Absence of clearcut demarcation of the roles to be played by the&#13;
Ministry of Manpower, Bureau of Manpower, labour attaches, and&#13;
foreign missions located in Bangladesh.&#13;
(o) No firm guideline in respect to terms and conditions of foreign&#13;
employment.&#13;
(p) Corrupt practices of middlemen, private recruiters, foreign em-&#13;
ploy-ers and Government officials.&#13;
8.11      While the issue of whether or not to pursue an active foreign employ-&#13;
ment policy will be discussed later, it is necessary to consider improvements in&#13;
the measures instituted in the immediate future to relieve problems created in&#13;
the process, namely harrassment of intended migrants, the gap between popular&#13;
expectation and realities, and the bottlenecks in processing the prospective&#13;
migrants. The sudden increase in the number of overseas placements has given rise&#13;
to a high expectation among all segments of society and it is widely believed that&#13;
with the support of influential persons, greasing the palms of middlemen and&#13;
officials, and persistent efforts, it is possible for any person to obtain a&#13;
high-salaried job in the Middle East. Numerous instances of cheating, frustration,&#13;
and harrassment have failed to dampen this spirit. The procedure of continuous&#13;
registration and issuing interview cards from a master register and the practice&#13;
of issuing interview cards to daily callers and persons recommended by influential&#13;
persons have added to this belief. The belated publication of a booklet in Bengali&#13;
detailing the essential information has not produced the desired result due to&#13;
its limited circulation and because of conflicting practices and diverse press&#13;
statements.  To keep the interest of the press and the public, it may be worth-&#13;
while for the Director General of RiET to hold fortnightly briefing sessions for&#13;
the press, radio and television.&#13;
8.12      The crucial procedural issue seems to be whether to advertise in the&#13;
press all vacancies (in which case unmanageable numbers of anulications are re-&#13;
ceived) or to depend on the registrants at employment offices (in which case the&#13;
processing of applicants is criticised being subject to manipulation by officials).&#13;
Another issue of similar nature is how to provide equal opportunity to all eligible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 231 -&#13;
aspirants, particularly those in the outlying districts. Other important issues&#13;
in the procedural matters are:&#13;
(a) How to pre-select the candidates for interviews, in what propor-&#13;
tion to the number needed, by which agency and using what criteria.&#13;
(b) How to organise systematic and smooth interviews and tests, how&#13;
to avoid large crowds, and how to deal with sudden changes/ additions!&#13;
deletions in the job list made by the employer or his representative.&#13;
(c) How to arrange trouble-free departure of selected candidates, in-&#13;
cluding arrangement for medical examination, issue of passports,&#13;
visas, air tickets and emigration clearance.&#13;
8.13      Before discussing appropriate procedures it must be reiterated that&#13;
the procedure should be well-documented, publicly announced and, once such an-&#13;
nouncement has been made it should be adhered to rigidly. Hence the procedure&#13;
should not include provisions which are not likely to be followed strictly be-&#13;
cause of social and other types of pressure.  It should also be adequate to meet&#13;
the present target of the Government, namely to present candidates within 3 to 4&#13;
weeks of the receipt of lists of job openings.  Some of the present procedural&#13;
maladies can be removed or at least minimised if the premises of the office&#13;
dealing with foreign employment is large and spacious, containing:&#13;
(a) Large waiting halls for general information, post-selection in-&#13;
formation, submission of applications and to obtain clearance&#13;
for emigration purposes. In each of these halls bank-like&#13;
counters could be opened to meet queries and deliver services.&#13;
(b) An immigration and passport office.&#13;
(c) A bank office.&#13;
(d) An airline office.&#13;
(e) A separate enclosure for use by recruiting teams.&#13;
(f)  A separate area for record rooms.&#13;
Needless to say, the present premises are inadequate and that without relaxing&#13;
the ceiling for Government renting, premises of the required type will not be&#13;
available.&#13;
8.14      Certain other procednural measures can be.adopted for operational ef-&#13;
ficiency:&#13;
(a) The procedure for registration and pre-selection should be based&#13;
entirely on merit. To judge the relative eligibility of appli-&#13;
cants for skilled work, practical tests could be conducted. For&#13;
the unskilled workers physical fitness required of a police con-&#13;
stable or an army Jawan could be prescribed and tests conducted&#13;
at the police or army headquarters.  In all district offices one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 232 -&#13;
week every month could be fixed for conducting tests, for the&#13;
technical trades in the polytechnic institutes and for the&#13;
unskilled trades in the police line.  Applicants with recuired&#13;
training, education and experience would appear at such tests.&#13;
Particulars of those qualifying in the tests would be retained&#13;
in the district offices and one copy sent to the central office&#13;
of the Bureau.  After conducting such tests for six months,&#13;
the picture of exportable manpower will be available, and pro-&#13;
grammes for further training can be organised where needed.&#13;
Meanwhile, those who have qualified in the tests in accordance&#13;
with test grades could be interviewed. The list of trades&#13;
mentioned in the Bengali booklet should be revised in line&#13;
with the present pattern of demand and tests be limited to&#13;
persons belonging only to these trades. Everyone qualifying&#13;
in the test could be issued a card containing a photograph,&#13;
signature, essential details, the dates and place of testing&#13;
and the results of the tests.&#13;
(b) Every employer in the public and private sectors employing per-&#13;
sons belonging to the eligible trades could be provided with&#13;
subsidies for training replacements if 10% or more of the firm's&#13;
employees have already left for employment abroad. In return,&#13;
no employee should be denied the opportunity to compete for&#13;
foreign employment.&#13;
(c)  A police contingent of appropriate size could be financed by&#13;
the Ministry of Manpower to be placed at the disposal of the&#13;
Director (Protocol) of BMET. The interview site should pre-&#13;
ferably be a training centre and the number of interviewees&#13;
should be limited to not more than two per vacancy, if the&#13;
testing arrangements can be followed.&#13;
(d)  As opposed to the present system of maintaining several copies&#13;
of applications in envelopes, only the test results in a card&#13;
form should be maintained by occupation. For every occupation&#13;
there should be three registers, one containing cards awaiting&#13;
interviews, the second for cards pre-selected for interviews,&#13;
and the third for cards selected by the employer.  Those re-&#13;
jected by the interviewer should go back to the register of&#13;
cards awaiting interviews with a stamp showing that the appli-&#13;
cant has been interviewed once.  Those rejected twice should&#13;
be sent back to the applicants.  There should be four officers,&#13;
two dealing with cards awaiting interviews and one each to deal&#13;
with cards pre-selected for interviews and cards selected for&#13;
departure. A full-time Deputy Director should be in charge and&#13;
a Public Relations Officer should be attached to this section&#13;
to announce the position of tested cards daily.&#13;
(e)  The foreign employment section of EMET should be in a separate&#13;
location. The Director (Foreign Employment) of BVIFT should&#13;
have financial authority to sanction expenditure up to Tk. 25,000&#13;
to deal with any aspect of recruitment. Similar authority to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 233 -&#13;
sanction expenditure up to Tk. 50,000 and up to Tk. 100,000&#13;
should be delegated to the Director General of BMET and the&#13;
Secretary of the Ministry of Manpower. A telex machine,&#13;
public address system, a fixed space in one English and one&#13;
Bengali newspaper, and a fixed five minute period of radio&#13;
and television per week are some of the essential facilities&#13;
needed by BME. The staffing of the foreign employment sec-&#13;
tion should be reviewed and in view of the fluctuating nature&#13;
of the workload, a system of hiring temporary executive as-&#13;
sistants may be introduced to meet the extra workload.&#13;
(f) Foreign missions located in Bangladesh may not be allowed to&#13;
deal with applicants directly, except when they are authorised&#13;
by an employer to conduct interviews.&#13;
(g)  Employees of all categories should be allowed opportunities to&#13;
compete, and departments of health, power, natural resources&#13;
and similar organisations showing reluctance to release employees&#13;
may be requested to undertake a manpower planning exercise to&#13;
justify their position to an inter-ministerial body to be con-&#13;
stituted for the purpose, or to a committee of the newly created&#13;
National Council for Skill Development and Training.&#13;
(h) A non-refundable processing fee of US11 5 per person may be&#13;
realised from all foreign employers including foreign missions.&#13;
Firms not fulfilling contractual obligations may be blacklisted&#13;
for future recruitment and such violations reported to the&#13;
appropriate authorities in the home Government of the foreign&#13;
firms.&#13;
(i) Besides unskilled labour, educated young persons of middle class&#13;
families trainable for clerical, catering, public relations,&#13;
teaching and executive jobs are available in large numbers.&#13;
Attempts may be made to enter into contracts with British,&#13;
European and American firms supplying such manpower to the Middle&#13;
East countries to organise training prograrmes at hone at the&#13;
cost of the willing trainees.&#13;
(j)  By utilising the Instructional Resources Preparations Unit (IRPU)&#13;
of EMET slides, transparencies, charts and other audio-visual&#13;
aids may be prepared for briefing the selected persons before&#13;
their departure.&#13;
(k) The Presidential announcement to set up an office for welfare&#13;
activities of the migrants should be followed and such a Director-&#13;
ate within the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training should&#13;
be established to look after the problems of migrants and their&#13;
dependents including those of remittance, utilisation of remit-&#13;
tance, import of goods and problems of dependents left behind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 234 -&#13;
(1)  A regulation division within WMET may be set up with authority&#13;
to prosecute, where necessary, licensed recruiters who vio-&#13;
late rules and procedures. Renewal of licenses should be made&#13;
contingent upon satisfactory performance. Unlicensed recruiters,&#13;
except -the individual Bangladeshi nationals residing abroad who&#13;
secure group visas, should be penalised heavily. Those securing&#13;
group visas may be asked to deposit a non-refundable fee of US$ 5&#13;
per person and two sureties at home to ensure fulfillment of con-&#13;
tractual obligations before they are permitted to proceed with&#13;
recruitment. Licensed recruiters' only obligation should be to&#13;
inform the Bureau of Manpower of the vacancies received and of&#13;
the particulars of persons departing for foreign employment. No&#13;
clearance of persons processed by licensed recruiters should be&#13;
necessary from the Bureau of Emigration, and the regulation&#13;
division of the Bureau should have authority to inspect the&#13;
records of such recruiters as frequently as necessary, but not&#13;
less than twice a year.&#13;
(m)  Guidelines relating to minimum wages and other conditions of&#13;
foreign employment should be decided upon in consultation with&#13;
private recruiters and this should be done in all cases including&#13;
those with group visas. The present indicative guidelines used&#13;
in YiET appear to be on the low side.&#13;
(n)  Unusual sensitivity has been noticed in the past in respect to&#13;
foreign employment in all segments of the society.  Consequently&#13;
the decision making process has been shifted upwards and routine&#13;
matters like pre-selection of interviewees have occasionally&#13;
been dealt with at very high levels. It is necessary to clearly&#13;
demarcate the role of various agencies of the Ministry of Man-&#13;
power. The suggested measures are:&#13;
(i)    In matters of receiving vacancies, pre-selection for in-&#13;
terviews, conducting interviews, arranging departures and&#13;
other operational activities, Director (Foreign Enployment)&#13;
should be the final decision making authority.&#13;
(ii)   Appeal against such decisions should rest with the&#13;
Director General.&#13;
(iii)  Policy and procedure making should be the responsibility&#13;
of the Secretary, Ministry of Manpower in consultation&#13;
with the D.G. of BIMT.&#13;
(iy)   There should be quarterly reviews of activities in the&#13;
Ministry by a formally constituted committee including&#13;
representatives of other agencies like immigration,&#13;
passport, banks, Biman, etc.&#13;
(v)    There should be an advisory comnittee consisting of, among&#13;
others, ron-Governmental members, and presided over by&#13;
a Minister, which should meet at least twice a year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 235 -&#13;
(vi)   Labour attaches should be under the administrative&#13;
control of BMET and these posts should be borne on the&#13;
strength of Th4ET.&#13;
(o) To minimise corruption, the Emigration Act should be revised to&#13;
provide for strict penal measures for:&#13;
(i)    Middlemen:  Severe penalty should be imposed on middle-&#13;
men who pose as the contact persons with officials, for-&#13;
eigh employers, and others in a position to influence&#13;
selection of job seekers.&#13;
(ii)   Officials:  Very severe penalties should be provided for&#13;
officials found to be encouraging middlemen as well as&#13;
tampering with records or using official positions to&#13;
favour a job seeker for money or for non-monitary consid-&#13;
erations.&#13;
(iii)  Licensed recruiters:  They should be dealt with in the&#13;
same manner as officials.&#13;
(iv)   Foreign Employers:  Foreign employers or their represen-&#13;
tatives or persons claiming to be in such positions, should&#13;
also be penalised for accepting money or other favours&#13;
from recruiters, job seekers or for making false promises&#13;
to them.&#13;
(v)    Job seekers:  Job seekers offering bribes either directly&#13;
or through middlemen, or trying to influence decisions&#13;
through illegal means, should be penalised by imprisonment.&#13;
(vi)   Others:  Anyone making unfounded allegations, including&#13;
the press, should be dealt with in the same manner as&#13;
job seekers.&#13;
(vii) The revision of the Act should also provide for summary&#13;
trial of complaints, and the proposed regulation division&#13;
of EMET should have powers of prosecution in such summary&#13;
courts.&#13;
C.  Institutional Arrangements&#13;
8.15      The procedural reforms suggested in the previous section are based&#13;
on certain assumptions regarding the institutional arrangemetns with the export&#13;
of manpower from Bangladesh. It is accepted that some of the conclusions drawn&#13;
are open to argument, some involve changes in administrative arrangements which&#13;
may have implications in other sectors of the economy and some are based on value&#13;
judgements and are matters of ideology.  In this sense the suggestions are some-&#13;
times more in the nature of policy indications rather than policy solutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 236 -&#13;
8.16      This section will discuss the role, function and responsibility of the&#13;
Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training in the export of manpower from Bangla-&#13;
desh and sDecificallv examine the Derformance of the private agents and of IMET.&#13;
The discussion is expected to help in arriving at institutional arrangements&#13;
which will not only maximize the manpower export and foreign exchange earnings&#13;
but also minimize social costs arising out of corruption, malpractice, etc. and&#13;
rationalize the system.&#13;
8.17      A case has often been made in favour of using agents rather than BMET,&#13;
in the belief that private enterprise will inspire greater efforts to obtain&#13;
Middle East jobs. There is something in this argument but all the experience in&#13;
other countries suggests that agents will cream off the easy work and increase&#13;
exploitation unless there are constraints placed on their activities.&#13;
8.18      Agents appear to be successful but in fact they are able to get few&#13;
vacancies fram the Middle East by their own efforts. They are successful only&#13;
in that they are able to get between eager job seekers and employers anxious to&#13;
engage them.  If agents merely charged for services rendered this situation would&#13;
not cause too much anxiety, but in fact they are extracting the highest possible&#13;
price for a job which is really not theirs to sell. The market in which they&#13;
operate is prepared for them by publicity which encourages workers to take too&#13;
optimistic a view of prospects so that they are prepared to raise large sums to&#13;
pay for what they expegt to be a job, but which is only a ticket in a lottery&#13;
for a job. The social evils in this system are such that it must be changed, not&#13;
just for social reasons but because in the long run it will have an adverse&#13;
economic effect on the market in which competition is intense.&#13;
8.19      There are mixed feelings about BMET and how much foreign employment it&#13;
should deal with. The varied opinions seem to st6m from a mistrust of the civil&#13;
service, its bureaucratic procedures and the temptation for civil servants to&#13;
extract some price from the job seeker for the service given.&#13;
8.20      The work of EMET and of private agents will be examined later, but at&#13;
this stage it ought to be said that both IMET and private agents are working in&#13;
new territory with little experience; that the climate in which they work needs&#13;
to be changed and that the opportunities in the Middle East are large_enough&#13;
for both private and public agencies to operate.  Competition is needed, but com-&#13;
petition between private agencies will not bring .down the price of getting a job,&#13;
and unless strict rules of conduct are enforced corruption will continue unabated.&#13;
So the extra competition of BMET and some part of a Government department is needed&#13;
to enforce the rules.&#13;
8.21      Before discussing the rules for market competition, the climate in which&#13;
IMET works will be examined. In developing countries, when job vacancies are to&#13;
be filled it can be said that -Who you know- is more important than 'What you know.&#13;
In short, the sezurity of people is built upon the help given by relations and&#13;
friends. Additionally it is accepted that people have little or no obligation&#13;
to those outside this group. This system is adequate in the traditional society&#13;
where the number of qualified people is greater than the number of jobs available,&#13;
even though it contains elements of unfairness to the poor who have little in-&#13;
fluence and accept a measure of exploitation (possibly being unaware of it).&#13;
With development come increasing skill demands and shortages of supply and then&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 237 -&#13;
'What you know' becomes more important than ~Who you know.' It then becomes&#13;
important for attainments and skills to be measured and for workers to be selected&#13;
by objective criteria. 'What you know' becomes more important and "Who you know'&#13;
has to act in a different role. At present BIMT staff are plagued, from highest&#13;
to lowest, by the 'Who you know' problem. All friends and relations, senior&#13;
officers and others with status assume that they have the right to indicate in one&#13;
way or another their interest in a job seeker. The result is that a straight-&#13;
forwar-d selection job occupies far more time than it ought to because of these&#13;
interventions. The only sensible way to allow BMET to work is for the man of&#13;
influence who wants to help a job seeker to write a small testimonial saying what&#13;
he knows of the job seeker and why he considers him to be a worthy candidate.&#13;
It is clear that EhET on its own cannot effect this change even though its senior&#13;
officers have courage and integrity. People outside WMET cannot be expected to&#13;
recognize the need for change and, in any event, will not accept the need for&#13;
change if they see very senior people continuing in the present ways. The change&#13;
has to start at the top and the intentions must be publicized.&#13;
8.22      Simultaneously with this change another is needed.  It is commonly ac-&#13;
cepted that a person who gets a job in the Middle East is so fortunate that he&#13;
ought to share his wealth. This is true and he does share with his extended fam-&#13;
ily. But it is also accepted that anyone who can get between him and the job is&#13;
entitled to extract his price. This is the equivalent of highway robbery. A&#13;
toll on the highway is justified in that the toll taken is charged for help given,&#13;
e.g. for the cost of a bridge which makes the journey easier. So there are legiti-&#13;
mate fees for services rendered, charged on an approved scale. The illegitimate&#13;
fees need to be eliminated. This will be difficult. To effect this change in&#13;
other countries has also been difficult and those who have been through it know&#13;
that there is no half wvay.  It has to be laid down in regulations what fees are&#13;
lawful, and no agent must charge a fee from a worker to submit his name for a&#13;
vacancy or to obtain a job. A fee may be charged to an employer to obtain a&#13;
qualified worker. But even then it is difficult for a public employment service&#13;
to justify a fee; the benefit to the economy at large when an employer gets a&#13;
suitable worker is full justification for a free employment service.&#13;
8.23      Things said in the previous paragraph are enshrined in an ILO convention.&#13;
This implies that there is morality in the argument, but it is also sound economic&#13;
sense.  While there are some developed countries which make charges to employers&#13;
using the public employment service, none charge the worker for the minimum&#13;
service. The convention is the target for all ILO members.&#13;
8.24      A prerequisite for the proper functioning of IMET is that Government&#13;
at the highest level should state two things:&#13;
(a)  Job seekers should not be charged a fee to be considered for a&#13;
job or to obtain a job. Fees for other services would be&#13;
prescribed.&#13;
(b)  Those who wish to support job seekers in their search for work&#13;
should restrict their efforts to giving testimonials, and they&#13;
should not intervene in the work of BMhT. As a corollary EMET&#13;
can then enforce the rule that during office hours MEMT staff&#13;
will not discuss foreign employment with anyone other than in&#13;
their prescribed duties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 238 -&#13;
If these things are stated, one director can be given the responsibility to&#13;
select and submit a job seeker to the employer; his work can be checked by the&#13;
Director General as necessary.&#13;
Role of IMET:  Information&#13;
8.25      The first need cf the Government in dealing with foreign employment is&#13;
for labour market information and while this is available from a number of sources&#13;
it must be focussed on HMET because that is the agency charged by the Government&#13;
with this responsibility.  So that policy makers can make sound decisions there&#13;
is a need for activities in three areas.&#13;
(a) Interpreting demand. For this IMET needs access to information&#13;
from the Middle East and other countries and which will come&#13;
from surveys (e.g. by World Bank), from reports from labour&#13;
attaches, from specific visits and from regular contacts with&#13;
employers, agents and job seekers. By implication this means&#13;
that IMhT must do placement work; without it the staff will&#13;
never have the understanding of the market necessary to ad-&#13;
vise Government policy makers.&#13;
(b)  Assessing overall supply.  The problem of assessing supply is&#13;
one for professionals working in the market because supply is&#13;
related to demand and the wage levels offered by employers. In&#13;
some occupations supply is so abundant that no strict assessment&#13;
is needed, e.g. for sweepers, agricultural labourers (when&#13;
vacancies in these occupations occur-the main preoccupation&#13;
for IMET is to avoid being overwhelmed by the volume of job&#13;
seekers). But for the majority of occupations workers are&#13;
employed in many small firms, or they are self-employed. So&#13;
the only satisfactory way to measure supply is to register job&#13;
seekers, assessing and testing their skills, and then maintain-&#13;
ing a master register. Workers will register only if registra-&#13;
tion might lead to employment so BMET must be able to submit&#13;
workers to jobs either directly or through agents.&#13;
(c)  Assessing specific supply in key occupations.  There is a group&#13;
of occupations which are in short supply and there are key occu-&#13;
pations on which a careful check is needed. Most frequently in&#13;
Bangladesh these will be in public corporations, or in private&#13;
enterprises which come under other ministries. To decide whether&#13;
the country can release people in key occupations EMET will re-&#13;
quire information and in turn the establishments concerned will&#13;
need to plan for release by training replacements.&#13;
8.26      In the context of the information needs, three recommendations come&#13;
out clearly:&#13;
(a) EMET must bring into use the Bangladesh Standard Classification&#13;
of Occupation (which is now being prepared) as soon as possible.&#13;
Not only should this be used by EMET and other ministries and&#13;
Government organisations but by all concerned with training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 239 -&#13;
Only by the use of a standard classification system can the&#13;
different needs of precise skills be integrated into a na-&#13;
tional plan for skill development.&#13;
(b) IMET must have staff operating in as large a sector of the&#13;
market as possible to be able to understand it and guide the&#13;
efforts to increase its penetration by Bangladesh.&#13;
(c) Bangladesh employers in all sectors must be encouraged to&#13;
develop manpower planning at the level of the firm. BhET has&#13;
a part to play in this (e.g. in improving recruitment practices)&#13;
and in encouraging the development of professional personnel&#13;
managers.&#13;
Role of BEET: Use of Information&#13;
8.27      Having amassed and used information in its own work and to assist&#13;
Government policy makers, BMET has then to meet its other responsibilities.&#13;
It has to give information to all sections of the public, including private agents,&#13;
about opportunities overseas. As protector of migrants (and potential migrants)&#13;
it has a duty to inform the public about the correct methods of doing business&#13;
and about malpractice.&#13;
(a) Representatives of BMET should appear regularly on teleyision&#13;
and be prepared to subject themselves to questions. The&#13;
television time should not be paid for; employment is news&#13;
and the time immediately before and after a programme of this&#13;
kind is prime advertising time.&#13;
(b) B4ET should be responsible for briefing visiting delegations&#13;
and for protocol work except at the highest levels. To this&#13;
end hMET needs a hospitality fund; BMET is selling a worthwhile&#13;
product and the profit will pay the advertising expenses.&#13;
(c)  Private agents should regard BEET as an ally in the information&#13;
field with a free exchange of information about problems.&#13;
Role of BMhT: Placemenit Work&#13;
8.28      That BMET is responsible for certain placement work is beyond question.&#13;
If foreign governments wish to hire workers for their armed services, civil&#13;
service, essential public services or public corporations, RAET is involved&#13;
(other arms of Government would also be involved). It is clear that only rarely&#13;
will a private agency be involved. BMET will be able to use its master register&#13;
for this work. It would, however, be wrong to restrict the use of the BME'T master&#13;
register to this narrow range of foreign employers. The service offered to both&#13;
the job seekers and the foreign employers should be similar to that provided&#13;
for employment in Bangladesh. The minimum service to be offered by BMBT is to&#13;
classify the jobs, to classify the job seekers and then to submit for the em-&#13;
ployers consideration a selection of job seekers in accordance with agreed&#13;
criteria. This service should be offered to foreign employers and to private&#13;
agents acting for foreign employers.  There should be no charge for this mini-&#13;
mum service, but IMET should be able to make charges for services other than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 240 -&#13;
this, e.g. testing job applicants, making the actual selection for an employer,&#13;
etc. Interviewing facilities should be offered freely by 4MET, even to agents&#13;
interviewing job seekers submitted to them by EMET.  But employers or agents&#13;
who wish to have test facilities might be charged for them. BMhT can, of course&#13;
waive charges in the interests of Bangladesh.&#13;
8.29      Similarly with job seekers IMET gives a minimum service freely but if&#13;
it is c_nsidered desirable by the Government BMET could be permitted to levy&#13;
charges for other services rendered. These charges would be similar to those&#13;
charged by agencies. This is a framework for the activities of EMET. Before&#13;
the detailed operations are considered, some consideration should be given to&#13;
the role of agencies.&#13;
The Role of Employment Agencies&#13;
8.30      In examining the problem of the exploitative nature of private enter-&#13;
prise agents and the malpractice of wrongdoers, the outside observer is puzzled&#13;
by the apparent absence of voluntary agencies (or charities). For example, there&#13;
seems to be a possibility of charitable agencies from Middle East countries&#13;
recruiting orphans for employment. This absence, however, means that the onus&#13;
for controlling the activities of agents falls squarely on the Government, and&#13;
that under present law involves BMTT.&#13;
8.31      There should be a separation of functions.  BMET to some extent competes&#13;
with agents, and it would be wrong for a competitor to police the agents. Sep-&#13;
aration might be achieved by having one directorate responsible for the policing&#13;
and another for the competition. This would, in most respects, be the best sol-&#13;
ution because whoever does the administrative control of the agents must have&#13;
staff experienced in operating in the labour market. Much would depend on the&#13;
attitude of the controlling director, and on the cooperation extended to agents&#13;
by the other directorates in IM.ET. There is the added advantage that arguments&#13;
could be resolved at Director General level with a right of appeal to the&#13;
Ministry of Manpower.&#13;
8.32      The activities of agents cannot be controlled without a registration&#13;
system. The first problem is that of the unregistered agent. This can be&#13;
resolved by a form of temporary registration, but first what will be required&#13;
of the agents must be considered. Agents are not required to recruit job seekers.&#13;
Anvone who has a vacancy can find job seekers either through the BMIT master re-&#13;
gister, by newspaper, radio or television, or by some other form of advertising.&#13;
People should therefore not be accepted for registration as employment agencies&#13;
if all they are going to do is to create a list of job seekers. If they are un-&#13;
able to make a profit from this, the incentive for them to do so disappears. This&#13;
type of agent should not be registered.  Charging fees for this service should&#13;
be illegal and it should also be illegal for unregistered employment agents to&#13;
operate. Such a law would make it difficult for unscrupulous foreigners to&#13;
operate in Bangladesh in this way, as the law would also apply to them.&#13;
8.33      That Bangladesh needs is job vacancies from Middle East countries.&#13;
Registered employment agencies would have the task of getting these vacancies,&#13;
preferably by direct contact with employers.  The aim should be to get a number&#13;
of agents to operate in a professional way, preferably to a large extent a self-&#13;
disciplining body of people working full time in that field. There would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 241 -&#13;
no objection to an employment agency operating in conjunction with a travel agency.&#13;
Part time agents seeking quick profit by creaming off easy business would be&#13;
gradually eliminated by a performance requirement, e.g. 50 vacancies filled per&#13;
year. The performance required would be such as to guarantee an agent an&#13;
adequate salary, exclusive of other activities, by the charging of a standard&#13;
fee to the employer (e.g. the equivalent of one month's salary of the worker&#13;
placed) to be paid when the worker has completed three months satisfactory&#13;
service.&#13;
8.34      The main problem to deal with after registering agents for full time&#13;
operation is how to deal with the very large number of vacancies which came to&#13;
Bangladesh in informal ways, mainly from Bangladeshis already in the Middle&#13;
East. There are two readymade solutions to this. Firstly, the person who has&#13;
the vacancy can give it to a registered agent who will then be able to build up&#13;
his contacts in the Middle East. Secondly, the employer can appoint, for ex-&#13;
ample, a Bangladeshi coming from the Middle East as his representative. Confir-&#13;
mation of the genuine nature of this appointment will be required and this would&#13;
best be given by a Bangladeshi labour attache, or a foreign embassy in Dacca.&#13;
Once assured of the genuine nature of the vacancies the representative would be&#13;
registered as a temporary agent by EMhT, which would give him assistance, if&#13;
he needed it, to locate workers and to get workers to their employer.&#13;
8.35      Once the ground rules have been laid down it is a relatively straight-&#13;
forward task to write the conditions of registration and the rules for conduct&#13;
of business.  BMET, or the Ministry if it were responsible for registration,&#13;
would encourage the formation of an Employment Agencies Association, would&#13;
consult such an association and keep it informed about things affecting their&#13;
work. In the best of situations the Agents Association would agree on rules&#13;
of conduct and IMET would lay down which rules would be backed by force of law.&#13;
8.36      When an agent applies for registration he must agree to certain condi-&#13;
tions. He should state the area in which he will operate. He may be an agent&#13;
for certain Middle East employers, he may operate in specified countries or he&#13;
may specialise in certain types of skill of occupations. The list of agents will&#13;
be published by IMET periodically so that the public knows to whom they can turn;&#13;
they will know that anyone not on the register should not be trusted.  If they&#13;
have doubts about a temporary agent a quick check with IMET will reassure them.&#13;
Alternatively BMET can publish each month a list of approved temporary agents and&#13;
their terms of reference. Other conditions for registration can be readily listed&#13;
but one that exists at present should be reviewed; that is the financial performance&#13;
bond.  It is doubtful if this serves its purpose in the present situation where&#13;
rewards from the highwayman type of operation are so great. Perhaps it should&#13;
be replaced by a registration fee designed to cover the costs of the scheme in-&#13;
cluding services to the agents by BMET. Indeed it might cover membership fees&#13;
collected on behalf of the professional association if the association so&#13;
wished. In time the annual fee could be negotiated between the Government and&#13;
the Thployment Agents Association.&#13;
8.37      It will be seen fram the above sections that what is proposed is the&#13;
balanced development of BhET and responsible private enterprise employment&#13;
agencies.  Both the public sector and the private sector need to develop the&#13;
skills of recruitment and selection, including testing (and in the case of EMET&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 242 -&#13;
in training as well) based on the Bangladesh Standard Occupational Classifi-&#13;
cation. The introduction of BSOC is essential for good employment and&#13;
training services connected with employment at home and abroad; it is essential&#13;
for manpower planning.&#13;
D. Emigration P6licy&#13;
8.38      In a country with a very high density of population, a sluggish&#13;
economic growth rate, and a huge labour surplus, encouraging emigration of the&#13;
population is perhaps a necessity. If it is accepted as a rational approach&#13;
then the major issue is whether Bangladesh is capable of administering an&#13;
emigration policy without generating any adverse impact on the economy, in the&#13;
context of the demand pattern now emerging in the world labour market,&#13;
particularly in the Middle Eastern countries. The measures so far adopted&#13;
by Bangladesh have ignored the demand potential in regions other than the&#13;
Middle East. In the United States of America an estimated one million Asian&#13;
workers are employed. Canada, a country with a low population growth rate,&#13;
is in need of foreign manpower and the number of Indian and Pakistani workers&#13;
in Canada is substantial. The UK, a traditional market for Bangladeshi man-&#13;
power, is virtually closed to her now, though some Asian countries, notably&#13;
the Philippines, have succeeded in securing substantial employment in the UK&#13;
in recent years. 1/ In countries like Germany, Sweden and France, the number&#13;
of non-national workers is significantly large and Bangladesh has made no&#13;
effort to secure employment of her nationals in these countries. Australia&#13;
and New Zealand also allow immigration and nearby South Pacific and Asian&#13;
countries besides India and Sri Lanka have availed themselves of these facil-&#13;
ities. Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and&#13;
several countries in Africa including Nigeria, Tanzania, Liberia, Algeria and&#13;
Zambia acquire contractual workers from abroad. Several South American countries,&#13;
notably Brazil, also allow immigration. The present poverty level in Bangladesh,&#13;
where close to 50% of the population live below the poverty line, and the&#13;
likely continuation of a similar situation over the next twenty years, make&#13;
the case for other countries to accept Bangladeshis as humanitarian and urgent&#13;
as that of political refugees. This statement is made only to bring home the&#13;
need for Bangladesh to give serious attention to emigration prospects in countries&#13;
other than those in the Middle East.&#13;
8.39      The number of Bangladeshis placed abroad from January 1976 to July&#13;
1979 is -very small when compared with the number of non-nationals working in&#13;
these countries.&#13;

Source:   International Labour Review, Vol. 118, No. 5, p. 592. Also see Chapter I.&#13;
It will be seen that out of a total or more than 1.7 million non-nationals in&#13;
these countries, Bangladeshis account for less than 0.06 million. Almost all&#13;
other Asian countries encouraging foreign employment have more nationals in these&#13;
countries. The number of workers from India, Pakistan, Korea, Philippines and&#13;
Taiwan are more and those from Thailand and Sri Lanka are about the same as that&#13;
of Bangladesh.&#13;
8.40      The number sent abroad is also insignificant campared to the employment&#13;
level in the national economy of Bangladesh and in its modern sector. Thployment&#13;
level in establishments employing 20 or more workers was found to be 1,096,699&#13;
in the 1977 survey of the Bureau of Manpower, and if adjustments are made for&#13;
employment in shops and commercial establishments covered by labour laws, the&#13;
modern sector employment in 1978 would be around 1.5 million. Adding another&#13;
0.5 million Government employees to the modern sector employment level, the pro-&#13;
portion of those securing jobs abroad is less than 3% of the employment level in&#13;
the modern sector. With hear stagnation of the economy during 1970-76 when GDP&#13;
increased at an average rate of only 1.6% and with the manufacturing sector re-&#13;
gistering an average growth rate of 1.8% per annum, there should be no seriously&#13;
adverse impact on production due to withdrawal in more than three years of 3%&#13;
of the employed persons. This appears to be the situation in the manufacturing&#13;
sector, where increase in output and profit, as apparent from press reports, has&#13;
taken place during 1976-78, a period when outflow of manpower has accelerated.&#13;
8.41      Evidence of an adverse impact in the Bangladesh economy may therefore&#13;
be sought in the services sector, including public utilities. Adverse impact&#13;
may also have been felt in manufacturing establishments employing workers with&#13;
narrow specialisations. Difficulties may have been experienced in recruiting&#13;
persons for occupations requiring several years of training or for occupationis&#13;
for which training facilities are not available in the country. The outflow may&#13;
1/   This includes 2,485 departures not shown by countries in Chapter I.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 244 -&#13;
also have adversely affected the already low quality of workers in certain occu-&#13;
pations. In the services sector health services appear to have suffered due to&#13;
an outflow of 1,024 doctors and nurses during 1976-1979. Restrictions have been&#13;
imposed on their outflow reducing the number going abroad from 608 in 1977 to&#13;
51 in the January-June period of 1979. The problem of medical manpower planning&#13;
is a complex one, regardless of whether such manpower is allowed to emigrate or&#13;
not. In Bangladesh there are more medical professionals than nurses. Effective-&#13;
ness of hospital services is minimised due to this peculiar situation as well as&#13;
due to the lack of medicine, equipment, and facilities for clinical investigation.&#13;
Professional positions in rural hospitals or rural health centres and in preventive&#13;
medical services like school health services, are difficult to fill. The majority&#13;
of the medical professionals being civil servants, determination of their pay,&#13;
status and working conditions in comparison with other civil servants have posed&#13;
serious problems involving strike threats by the medical professionals in recent&#13;
periods. On the other hand, the personnel policy of the Health Ministry in manning&#13;
rural positions has remained whimsical. Medical professionals depend more on&#13;
private practice outside the hospital or duty hours and resent and resist transfer&#13;
to rural areas with poor prospects for private practice and poor facilities for&#13;
their children's education. Hence, the problem of recruiting medical manpower&#13;
cannot be ascribed to their outflow alone.  It is necessary to discuss the problems&#13;
of manpower planning in the health sector at the national level by an inter-&#13;
ministerial research group, with a view to adopting an appropriate health manpower&#13;
policy. Meanwhile, the question to be asked in the context of an emigration&#13;
policy is: Can a ban on the foreign employment of medical doctors provide any&#13;
relief to the existing problems, namely supplying such manpower to rural areas or&#13;
to preventive sectors, and low effectiveness of hospital services? Obviously,&#13;
such a ban will prevent further deterioration of this situation, though it is un-&#13;
likely to effect any improvement. The remedy lies in finding alternative means&#13;
for delivering services and not so much in the ban, which can be easily evaded.&#13;
The situation possibly calls for a restriction in the shape of permitting an&#13;
annual outflow of about 20% of the annual output, in all categories and a higher&#13;
percentage of relatively surplus categories like dentists, general practitioners,&#13;
and paramedical persons other than nurses. The bulk of this 20% should be selected&#13;
from those serving in rural hospitals. This issue may be decided in a committee&#13;
of the National Council for Skill Development and Training recently established in&#13;
the Ministry of Manpower.&#13;
8.42      Among public utilities, the electricity generation and distribution&#13;
sector may have suffered to a larger extent than other sectors like transport,&#13;
telephone, telegraph and postal services.  1,434 powerhouse technicians have&#13;
secured employment abroad during 1976 to June 1979, and the outflow has decreased&#13;
from 532 in 1976 to 33 in the first half of 1979, presumably because of restric-&#13;
tions imposed. This sector also resembles the health sector insofar as profes-&#13;
sional and technical manpower are reluctant to work in the remote power generating&#13;
stations like Kaptai, Shahgi Bazar, etc., just as the medical manpower is reluctant&#13;
to serve in rural hospitals and in preventive services. It has not been possible&#13;
to devise an appropriate personnel policy involving rotation between the preferred&#13;
and disliked positions nor to utilise the substitutability potential in full&#13;
between degree level engineers and diploma level engineers qualifying from university&#13;
colleges and polytechnic institutions respectively. The technicians, whether for-&#13;
mally or informally trained, form the group of key personnel in this sector of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 245 -&#13;
public utility and the possibility of utilising them in more responsible positions&#13;
has not been taken into account either. Due to lack of serious attention to these&#13;
aspects of manpower planning by the administrative agency, an attempt to train re-&#13;
placements in anticipation of future departure, did not succeed. Recent discussions&#13;
among Power Development Board employees, as reported in the press, confirmed the&#13;
impression that inefficiency in the delivery of services was more due to management&#13;
inadequecies like wastage, corruption, lack of spare parts, equipment and materials&#13;
and quality of managerial personnel than the departure of its employees for foreign&#13;
employment. It appears feasible, at least conceptually, to allow unrestricted&#13;
foreign employment of power generation and supply personnel, provided proper man-&#13;
power planning techniques, including anticipatory replacement training, are applied&#13;
by the management.&#13;
8.43      The same appears to be the situation in respect to postal and telecom-&#13;
munications personnel. Lack of consistency in the department's approach to the&#13;
foreign employment of its employees became evident, when less than two months after&#13;
the visit of a departmerntal delegation to the Middle Eastern countries to promote&#13;
foreign employment, the department refused, on grounds of scarcity, to release&#13;
workers selected by recruiting teams from some of the countries visited. Similar&#13;
inconsistencies have been noticed in other departments also. Even in the manufac-&#13;
turing sector, certain corporations claimed existence of surplus workers on their&#13;
payroll only to change this position soon thereafter. In a few instances, like&#13;
the Chittagong Steel Mills, management succeeded in sparing their employees for&#13;
foreign employment by instituting a suitable replacement training programme. So&#13;
is the case with, to a lesser degree, the Chemical and Fertiliser Corporation.&#13;
Some establishments expressing the inability to release persons selected for foreign&#13;
employment, refused to reabsorb returnee migrants in the same trade. Small establish-&#13;
ments like those manufacturing specialised textile products suffered loss of pro-&#13;
duction owing to their inability to organise replacement training. Due to a large&#13;
number of vehicle drivers who have gone abroad, several training institutions sprang&#13;
up in the private sector, though employers have found the quality of the replace-&#13;
ment workers to be of a lower level. The same is the case with clerical workers,&#13;
hotel and catering workers and construction workers. 1/&#13;
8.44      Wage increase and the consequent increase in production cost is another&#13;
possible area adversely affected by foreign employment. The situation in Bangladesh&#13;
is different, however, as the bulk of the modern sector is under state control and&#13;
wages are determined by expert commissions like the 1974 and 1978 commissions for&#13;
Government employees, corporation employees and industrial workers. In the reports&#13;
of these commissions there was no indication of the need to take into account the&#13;
scarcity factor, in respect to any occupation. Other surveys have revealed large&#13;
numbers of vacant posts, kept vacant as economy measures or due to procedural com-&#13;
plexities. The foreign employment of about 60,000 workers during the recent past&#13;
has brought to the limelight the callous manner in which employers in the public&#13;
and private sectors have dealt with the recruitment and training of manpower for&#13;
their establishments. Increasing attention now required in arrangement replacement&#13;
training on an anticipatory basis, is proving beyond the capacity of the Bangladeshi&#13;
management in the public and private sector. Unless this capacity is developed,&#13;
Bangladesh cannot adopt an emigration policy of any consequence, and the present&#13;
situation is a reflection of this management inability.&#13;
1/   For a description of the paradoxes in the labour market situation, see Chapter I.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 246 -&#13;
8.45      Foreign demand being largely limited to persons with several years ex-&#13;
perience even in unskilled categories (dock labourers, for example), the process&#13;
of skill formation and experience accumulation needs to be studied. In the con-&#13;
struction sector, where the foreign demand is very high, skill formation takes&#13;
place nostly outside the institutions. Masons, brick layers, shuttering carpenters,&#13;
rod binders, pipe fitters, and plumbers are not trained in any institution in&#13;
Bangladesh even now. The trainee begins as a helper with a master craftsman and&#13;
learns his trade by observation and practice. The employer does not incur any&#13;
training expenditure and the margin of profit in construction trade has been tra-&#13;
ditionally very high. The construction firms are not required to maintain more&#13;
than a modest establishment as the work is usually sub-contracted and as the client&#13;
(mostly Government institutions) takes responsibility for supplying construction&#13;
materials, layout plan and other essential inputs. Any change from this position&#13;
will obviously be resented by employers. This situation needs to be remedied&#13;
irrespective of the foreign employment issue. The National Council for Skill Devel-&#13;
opment and Training, set up as a precondition for a World Bank loan, may establish&#13;
training committees for construction trades consisting of employers to organise&#13;
training, testing, and certification.&#13;
8.46      In the manufacturing sector, the skill formation process is similar.&#13;
A temporary substitute worker recruited at the gate, is appointed as helper after&#13;
successive substitutions and becomes a semi-skilled worker through observation and&#13;
practice. Similar arrangements as suggested for the construction trades are nec-&#13;
essary whether foreign employment is a consideration for workers in manufacturing&#13;
establishments or not. Since institutional training is mostly limited to basic&#13;
engineering trades for maintenance and repairs, it should be dealt with seperately&#13;
from the production trades. A survey of existing training, testing, and certifica-&#13;
tion systems should be undertaken tradewise and a national system for each trade&#13;
should be introduced with the help of employers, providing adequate scope for in-&#13;
formally trained workers to take advantage of the opportunities. The system should&#13;
be flexible enough to enable an unskilled worker to compete for professional&#13;
examinations by stages. An unskilled worker's personality development should be a&#13;
major aim of training in addition to training in higher skills.&#13;
8.47      Besides the above limitation imposed by management inadequacy the other&#13;
constraints in adopting a bold emigration policy are:&#13;
(a) Capability of the Government machinery to project an image of Bangla-&#13;
desh as a reliable source of quality manpower.&#13;
(b)  Capability of the Government machinery to project a realistic picture&#13;
of job prospects to national aspirants.&#13;
(c)  Capability of the Government machinery to ensure adoption of a merit-&#13;
based recruitment process by public and private sector recruiting&#13;
agencies.&#13;
(d) Capability of the construction firms in the public and private sector&#13;
to secure contracts abroad.&#13;
(e) Expansion of air communications, banking, postal and telecommunica-&#13;
tions facilities between Bangladesh and the Middle East.&#13;

(f) Capability of the Government machinery and the money market to&#13;
offer adequate investment opportunities to small investors from&#13;
amongst those working abroad.&#13;
(g) Capability of the banking system to attract deposits from nationals&#13;
working abroad.&#13;
(h) Capability of the education and training system to respond to the&#13;
needs of labour market which arise out of foreign employment.&#13;
Some of these issues have been discussed earlier. Depending on the seriousness&#13;
of the administrative ministry and its capability to influence decisions of other&#13;
agencies, an emigration policy can be formulated aiming at meeting a realistically&#13;
predetermined proportion of the estimated foreign demand.&#13;
8.48      Anticipating the magnitude and characteristics of demand for expatriate&#13;
workers remains a major problem despite numerous studies undertaken by agencies in&#13;
recent periods. Then again, the portion of the estimated demand which can be secured&#13;
by Bangladesh will depend almost entirely on the Bangladeshi management ability.&#13;
However the following characteristics of demand pattern deserves mentioning:&#13;
(a) Close to half the additional demand for expatriate workers in the&#13;
Middle Eastern region will be generated in Saudi Arabia, with&#13;
another one-fourth being generated in Libya and Iraq.&#13;
(b) There will also be additional vacancies created by the manpower&#13;
importing countries' policy to diversify the source of supply.&#13;
(c) Many of these additional vacancies, including those arising out&#13;
of replacement, will go to oriental countries like South Korea,&#13;
Taiwarn, and the Philippines who have shown proven capability to&#13;
undertake turnkey projects with their own capital, technology and&#13;
manpower, thus relieving the employer of the troublesome tasks of&#13;
recruitment and management of expatriate workers. Among South&#13;
Asian countries, India has developed this capability both in the&#13;
private and public sector, and Pakistan has begun to do so.&#13;
(d)  Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, with acute shortage of foreign exchange,&#13;
and with a low technology base are not likely to be in a position&#13;
to secure such turnkey projects, though they are likely to sueceed&#13;
better in securing sub-contracts from the bidder which will require&#13;
the establishment of a closer liaison with firms securing turnkey&#13;
projects.&#13;
8.49      Growth rates in the non-national component of the labour force which&#13;
varied from 4 to 15% in these countries in the recent past, do not reflect the&#13;
actual recruitment made, as replacernXnt of expatriates on expiry of contract is&#13;
not accounted for in the increase. For Bangladesh, potential recruitment is more&#13;
relevant than potential increase in the size of the non-national segment of the&#13;
labour force. Assuming that during 1980-85, the magnitude of recruitment in the&#13;
Middle East will be the same as that of the 1975 level of employment of non-&#13;
nationals, and assuming that Bangladesh will be able to secure 20% of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

vacancies in countries with which she had entered into bilateral agreements and&#13;
10% in the rest, the demand pattern emerges as shown in the Table below.&#13;

The above exercise, however unreliable, will point out that the present optimistic&#13;
announcements by policy makers of adopting an annual target of 100,000 workers&#13;
places abroad is unrealistic. To achieve the target implied in the above Table of&#13;
securing 43,566 vacancies per year, efforts must be substantially strengthened,&#13;
particularly in Saudi Arabia and Libya. It has to be noted that so far the number&#13;
of Bangladeshi workers has not reached 10% of the non-nationals in any country&#13;
except Qatar, and in Saudi Arabia the number is less than 1% (see Table 8.1).&#13;
8.50      The implications of the above target are obvious.  Much greater attention&#13;
will have to be paid to the labour market in Saudi Arabia, Libya, Kuwait and Iraq.&#13;
In these countries annually 15,412, 13,265, 4,264 and 2,000 vacancies will need&#13;
to be secured for Bangladeshi workers. Taking note of the fact that close to 60%&#13;
of employment was secured by individual effort, travel facilities to those countries&#13;
will need to be liberalised. Private construction firms will need to be provided&#13;
with incentives and facilities to compete in the Middle East. Credit facilities in&#13;
foreign exchange will be essential for such firms. An organisation in the pattern&#13;
of the Korean Development Corporation which undertakes construction work in Middle&#13;
Eastern countries as well as promotes private construction firms, may be set up.&#13;
Private recruiters will need to be assisted in contacting foreign firms on a&#13;
selective basis.&#13;
8.51      It is believed that the 1975 pattern of demand will continue during&#13;
1980-85, which means that 60% of the foreign employees needed will be unskilled&#13;
workers possessing several years experience in the trade. 41t of the foreign workers&#13;
including the unskilled experienced workers will be required in the construction&#13;
sector. The policy implications of this is that training of workers now employed&#13;
as helpers in construction, public utilities, transport and communications, ports,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 249 -&#13;
and in selected manufacturing industries like fertiliser plants, refineries, and in&#13;
selected occupations like welder should be intensified including training in per-&#13;
sonality development. Training of unemployed persons for this purpose should be&#13;
discontinued and if the Government intends to assist special groups like freedom&#13;
fighters and nominees of the Youth Ministry, they should first be appointed as helpers&#13;
in a local firm before being allowed to undergo training. In conclusion, it needs&#13;
to be reiterated that much more serious attention will need to be paid by the&#13;
Bangladesh management including the Government, employers, and the training insti-&#13;
tutions and the present impression widely held in Bangladesh that foreign employ-&#13;
ment opportunities can be had by everybody, irrespective of experience, physical&#13;
fitness and skill should be dispensed with.&#13;
E. Remittances and Related Issues&#13;
8.52      Though satisfaction is being expressed over the increase in remittance&#13;
from a monthly average of Tk. 4.03 million in 1974 to Tk. 221.18 million in&#13;
January-June 1979, what must be examined is whether it has been possible to attract&#13;
the full potential of migrants' remittances to the official banking channel and&#13;
if not, why not. It is also necessary to examine the impact such remittances have&#13;
on the economy, mainly to find out whether it is possible to put such remittances&#13;
to better use. An analysis of the remittance pattern will also indicate the&#13;
quality of employment of Bangladeshis abroad.&#13;
8.53      An attempt to make any estimate of potential remittance will involve&#13;
assumptions of an arbitrary nature in the absence of reliable figures. Assuming&#13;
that the number of Bangladeshi workers in the Middle East as of December 1978&#13;
was 100,000, including the 44,503 sent abroad during 1976-78, and assuming their&#13;
distribution between professional, skilled and unskilled (including semi-skilled)&#13;
to be slightly different from that in Chapter I, and assuming that an amount of&#13;
$400, $250, and $100 can be saved monthly by the professional, skilled and unskilled&#13;
workers respectively, the potential monthly saving from the workers' earnings in&#13;
the Middle East can be estimated at US$ 37 million as shown in the Table below.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Converted into Bangladesh currency at the rate of Tk. 15 to a Dollar, the potential&#13;
remittance appears to be Tk. 560.1 million per month compared to the monthly&#13;
average of Tk. 221.18 million recorded in January-June 1979. Taking only the Middle&#13;
Eastern countries, remittance from which constituted approximately half of the total&#13;
remittance during January-June 1979, the potential monthly remittance appears to&#13;
be Tk. 280.05 million compared to a monthly average of Tk. 87.09 million from&#13;
Middle Eastern countries recorded during January-June 1979. If the assumed rate of&#13;
saving is halved, the potential remittance will be 20% more than the actual remit-&#13;
tance from all countries and 38% more than the actual remittance from the Middle&#13;
East.&#13;
8.54      Actual remittance per worker from Middle Eastern countries appears to be&#13;
much less than the possible savings. Calculating remittance per worker as&#13;
R 1/   Difference in average monthly remittance between 1979 and 1977&#13;
W             Number of vacancies secured during 1976-1978&#13;
The remittance per worker per month is the lowest from Oman (US$ 5) and the highest&#13;
from Saudi Arabia (us$ 466). The average remittance per worker per month for the&#13;
nine countries in the Middle East in US$ 100. Remittance from Bahrain, UAE is&#13;
also low at US$ 28 and US$ 32. Oman, UAE and Bahrain are the three countries where&#13;
most of the employment has been secured through individual efforts or on group&#13;
visas. The low remittance, particularly from Oman, lends credence to the belief&#13;
that a substantial proportion of the newcomers enter these countries either on very&#13;
low paid jobs or with what is known as KFree No Objection Certificates.' These&#13;
documents entitle a person to enter the country with an offer from an employer&#13;
who is just lending his name against monetary considerations and who will release&#13;
him from his imaginary employment after the job seeker has found a genuine job.&#13;

+Workers who secured employment during 1976-78.&#13;
The above Table shows that remittance is not related to the number of workers alone.&#13;
In UAE, where the number is largest, remittance is low possibly because of low&#13;
quality of employment, successful operation by middlemen and remittance through&#13;
unofficial channels, despite the presence of a Bangladeshi bank in the country.&#13;
The same may be the case in Qatar. Oman appears to be a case of very low quality&#13;
employment as no recruitment seems to have been made by the Government agency and&#13;
no embassy of Bangladesh has been established there. Higher remittance per worker&#13;
in Kuwait, Iran, and Iraq can be explained by the larger proportion of professional&#13;
and skilled workers in that country. 1/ In Libya lower remittance may be due to&#13;
the procedural difficulties and inadequate banking facilities between Libya and&#13;
Bangladesh. The situation in Saudi Arabia seems to be more favourable and the reasons&#13;
may be:&#13;
(a) A favourable proportion of professional, skilled and unskilled workers&#13;
from Bangladesh in Saudi Arabia.&#13;
(b) Satisfactory banking facilities between Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh.&#13;
(c) Fewer middlemen operating and less use of unofficial channels.&#13;
(d) Absence of home Government's restriction in remitting savings abroad.&#13;
(e) Better organised labour wing of the Bangladesh Mission.&#13;
(f) Successful negotiation of agency arrangements with non-national firms&#13;
by the Government agency.&#13;
1/   See Appendix Tables 59 and 60.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 252 -&#13;
8.56      The embassy s labour wing in all countries may strengthen their promo-&#13;
tional efforts to mobilise remittance through official channels, and Bangladeshi&#13;
banks may further streamline their systems to ensure speedy receipt of remittances&#13;
by beneficieries. One single policy measure likely to have a significant impact on&#13;
the flow of remittance is the payment of 75% of the salary in foreign exchange to&#13;
the worker's foreign currency account in Bangladesh. In one case, a non-national&#13;
firm had made similar arrangements to the advantage of both the workers and the&#13;
firm, with active cooperation of a leading Bangladeshi bank. The worker on pay&#13;
day, would receive 25% of his salary and a document showing remittance of the&#13;
remaining salary to his foreign currency account in Bangladesh.&#13;
8.57      Use of remittance for productive purposes is a complex problem.  The&#13;
potential saving of an unskilled Bangladeshi working abroad is about Tk. 24,000&#13;
per year, which is inadequate for any worthwhile investment by an individual.  In&#13;
the case of the professional categories, the potential saving per annum comes to&#13;
Tk. 96,000 which is also inadequate. It is therefore not surprising that most of&#13;
the workers purchase land after meeting their immediate consumption needs. The&#13;
money market in Bangladesh is unable to offer any alternative source of investment&#13;
capable of yielding returns at a rate higher than or comparable to the increase&#13;
in the resale value of land. The opportunities of pooling small savings are limited&#13;
in view of the lack of trust in such ventures. However, some of the following&#13;
ideas may be considered in this context:&#13;
(a) Tax free import of X-ray machines, hospital equipment, and similar&#13;
machines for the purpose of setting up private medical clinlics.&#13;
(b)  Similar import facilities for equipment required by automobile re-&#13;
pair and maintenance workshops and general engineering workshops.&#13;
(c) Similar facilities to set up small restaurants in Dacca and other&#13;
major cities.&#13;
(d) Facilities to set up shops and trading stores in urban areas.&#13;
(e) Facilities for rural workshops to repair agricultural machinery,&#13;
and for rural electrification and transport.&#13;
(f)  Facilities to enlist contractors with the Ministry of Work and the&#13;
Ministry of Rural Development.&#13;
(g)  Facilities to set up cinema houses, cold storage and other projects.&#13;
What is being highlighted by the above suggestions is the need to work out possible&#13;
areas of investment by the returnee migrants. A financial organisation in the&#13;
private sector may be considered to finance these and other types of projects.&#13;
The migrants can be shareholders in such an organisation besides borrowing for&#13;
projects eligible for financing.&#13;
8.58      Equally complex is the problem of exploitation of migrants in respect to&#13;
remittances. In addition to the measures suggested earlier, a post of Banking&#13;
Attache may be considered in Bangladesh Missions in countries where the number of&#13;
Bangladeshi workers has exceeded 5,000. South Korea has Construction Attaches in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 253 -&#13;
some of their missions abroad to help the Korean firms secure contracts.&#13;
8.59      Last but not least, the education prograamme for adult workers needs to be&#13;
strengthened significantly irrespective of the consideration for foreign employ-&#13;
ment. Most of the adult workers lack confidence in themselves and allow middlemen&#13;
to exploit them in almost all walks of life. It is not in the nature of an adult&#13;
worker because of the traditionally inflated social value attached to literacy and&#13;
white collar occupations, to luestion even impossible proposals coming from a&#13;
seemingly educated urban person. Though these workers do not lack common sense,&#13;
they easily fall victim to false promises. An information and education programme&#13;
for adult workers appears, therefore, to be an urgent necessity to highlight the&#13;
exploitative nature of middlemen and to generate self-conlidence.&#13;

migrants the highest number (71.75%) are in the major occupational group 07/08/09,&#13;
prod-uction and related. workers including skilled. and unskilled constru.ction labour,&#13;
followed by major group 05, service workers (8.37%) including catering workers and&#13;
domestic servants.  The major group 01, professional and technical migrants, con-&#13;
stitutes only 7.98%. All other occupations such as clerical and related, sales,&#13;
agriculture, fishery, etc., claim 6.80% of the migrants. Details of 5.1C% of the&#13;
migrants were not available for study in this Table. Further description follows&#13;

Table 2.  This Table shows the classification into detailed occupation of migrants&#13;
under each major occupation.  This Table is closely related to Table 1, Table 14,&#13;
and Table 15.&#13;
Major Occupation Group 01 (professional, technical and related):  As in Table 1&#13;

enginees's 2.1%. There is another category called tengineert claiming 10.53%,&#13;
further details were not available as to what kind of engineers they are.  Never-&#13;
theless, engineers and thereby civil engineers seem to be in the highest demand&#13;
among the professional migrants in the Middle East, followed by medical doctors&#13;
(9.47%o), nurses (7.02%), accountants (4.91%) and teachers (2.81%).  The demand for&#13;

- 256 -&#13;
Major Occupation Group 06 (agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry workers,&#13;
fishermen and hunters): As in Table 1, these migrants are 3.64% of the total.&#13;
Five trades have been included under this major group of occupations, of which&#13;
fishermen have the highest demahd (80.77%) followed by sailors (7.69%), farmers and&#13;
gardeners (5-38%) each and cultivators less than 1%.&#13;
Major Occupation Group 07/08/09 (production and related workers, transport equip-&#13;
ment operators and labourers): As in Table 1, these migrants claim 71.75%o of the&#13;
total.  This is the single major labour exporting-group of occupations.  175 trades&#13;

are in 165 different trades in this group.,&#13;
Major Occupation Group 10 (workers not classified by occupation): As in Table 1,&#13;
these migrants are less than 1% of the total. In this group the sample size is&#13;
only 25 distributed over 8 different trades.  Sufficient information of these trades&#13;
is not known. As for the category tsupervisort it is not known what type of super&#13;
visors they are. Job descriptions of 7 other unknown trades were also not available.&#13;
However, the number of 1igrating workers in the group is not significant; so this&#13;
will not limit the study.&#13;

MENA CLASSIFICATION&#13;
OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR THE MEDITERRANEAN REGIONAL PROJECT&#13;
The following classification system was used in the OECD Mediterranean&#13;
Project 11: the system categorizes all the occupations in the ISCO 2/ into four&#13;
groups according to the educational and training requirements of the occupations.&#13;
All code numbers are those of the ISCO which should be consulted for the detailed&#13;
content of each occupational category and for the definitions of the occupations.&#13;
Class A&#13;
Scientific and Technical Occupations:&#13;
Architects (unit group 0-01)&#13;
Engineers (unit group 0-02)&#13;
Physical scientists and mathematicians (minor group 0-1; occupations O-Y9.35)&#13;
Biologists, veterinarians, agronomists, and related scientists (minor group 0-2)&#13;
Professional medical personnel&#13;
(a) Physicians and surgeons (unit group 0-31)&#13;
(b) Dentists (unit group 0-32)&#13;
(c)  Other professional medical workers (unit group 0-51, 0-52, 0-59)&#13;
University teachers, sciences (occupation 0-61.30)&#13;
Secondary school teachers, sciences (occupation 0-69.40) 3/&#13;
Other Occupations:&#13;
Administrative, executive and managerial workers (major group 1)&#13;
(a) Administrative and executive officials, government (group 1-0)&#13;
(b) Directors, managers and working proprietors (minor group 1-1) 4/&#13;

3/   The ISCO does not differentiate between teachers of science and other teachers at&#13;
the secondary level. For purposes of the classification system for the OECD&#13;
project, therefore, ISCO occupation 0-69.40 was divided into two sub-groups.&#13;
4/   Note that working proprietors in wholesale and retail trade are excluded from&#13;
this category and included among sales workers. Other proprietors who are not&#13;
primarily directing and managing enterprises or services, but principally per-&#13;
form professional, technical, craft, service or other functions are also ex-&#13;
cluded from this category and are classified according to the particular function&#13;
they perform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 388 -&#13;
University teachers, except sciences (occupations 0-61.20, 0-61.90)&#13;
Teachers not elsewhere classified, not including elementary and nursery school&#13;
teachers (occupation o-69.90)&#13;
Secondary school teachers, except sciences (occupation o-69.40)&#13;
Economists, professional accountants, actuaries, and statisticians (unit group&#13;
0-YE, o-Y 4)&#13;
Social scientists other than economists (minor group 0-8; unit group 0-Y2, occupation&#13;
0-Y9.20, 0-Y9.23, 0-Y9.26, 0-Y9.29, 0-Y9.32, 0-Y9.38, 0-Y9.41, 0-Y9.44, 0-Y9.47)&#13;
Artists, writers, and related creative artists (minor group 0-9)&#13;
Class A workers not elsewhere classified (minor group 0-7; unit group 0-Y3; occu-&#13;
pations 0-Y9.50, 0-Y9.59, 0-Y9.90)&#13;
Class B&#13;
Science and engineering technicians and draftsmen (minor group 0-X)&#13;
(a) Technicians, engineering (occupation (0--iX9.20)&#13;
(b)  Technicians, research laboratory (occupation 0-X9.30)&#13;
(c) Technicians, industrial laboratory (occupation o-x9.40)&#13;
(d) Science and engineering technicians not elsewhere classified and laboratory&#13;
assistants (occuration 0-X9. 90)&#13;
(e) Draftsmen (unit group 0-41)&#13;
Surveyors (unit group 0-03)&#13;
Medical and dental technicians (unit group 0-53- occupation 7-41.45)&#13;
Nurses, professional (unit group 0-41)&#13;
Class B workers in transport and communications&#13;
(a) Deck officers, engineer officers, and ships pilots (minor group 6-0)&#13;
(b) Aircraft pilots, navigators, and flight engineers (minor group 6-2)&#13;
(c) Radio communication operators (unit group 6.72)&#13;
(d) Inspectors, traffic controllers and dispatchers (minor group 6-6, except&#13;
occupations 6-62.40 and 6-62.50; unit group 6-93)&#13;
Non-working foremen 1/&#13;
Primary and nursery school teachers (occupations 0-69.30 and 0-69.20)&#13;
Salesmen of insurance and securities (occupations 3-11.20, 3-11.4o, 3-11.70, 3-11.90)&#13;
Class B workers not elsewhere classified (minor group 9-7; minor group 9-8; except&#13;
occupation 9-81.90- occupations 0-Y9.35, O-Y9.56, o-Y9.62, o-Y9.65, 0-Y9.90; 7-61.50,&#13;
7-69.4o) 2/&#13;
1/   There is no category of 'foremen' in the ISCO.  Non-working foremen should be&#13;
classified here. Working foremen are classified in the same occupation as the&#13;
workers they supervise.&#13;
2/   Code number 0-Y9.90 is included here as well as under Class A occupations.&#13;
This is a residual group, professional, technical and related workers not else-&#13;
where classified. It is intended that professional occupations not elsewhere&#13;
classified will be included in Class A, while semi-professional occupations&#13;
not elsewhere classified will be included here.&#13;

            Labor migration from Bangladesh to the
            Middle East
        </repnme>

            Since the mid 1970s, labor migration
            from South and East Asia to the Middle East has been
            increasing very rapidly. It has many important economic and
            social implications, including those for the balance of
            payments, spending of migrant families, labor market,
            training needs, implementation of development projects,
            domestic savings and investments and income distribution.
            The undertaking of this study in Bangladesh was promoted by
            the lack of knowledge about these various aspects and
            consequently about the costs and benefits of labor migration.
