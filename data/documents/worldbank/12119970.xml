            Minority shareholders : what works to
            protect shareholder rights?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The World Bank's assessments of
            corporate governance practices in 25 countries across five
            continents have revealed a general commitment to comply with
            international principles. But the necessary legal changes
            are slow and subject to political compromise. Moreover, most
            countries have a poor track record in enforcing existing
            laws and regulations. Expropriation of minority shareholders
            continues to be a problem around the world. The corporate
            governance assessments show that choice can facilitate
            reform. Allowing different models of corporate governance to
            coexist permits investors with varying risk profiles to
            choose the appropriate market and company to invest in and
            allows market forces to pick the winners. When companies
            have the choice of listing their shares on a stock market
            segment with stricter corporate governance rules or of
            complying with a code of best practice, they can use this
            option to signal to investors that they are different. While
            establishing a corporate governance market segment appears
            to be an attractive option only for middle-income countries,
            codes of best practice seem to be important regardless of a
            country's level of development.
