subject to a similar or equivalent confidentiality obligation. The Donor and IFC agree that should the Donor&#13;
wish to publicly disclose any information shared by IFC, either directly or through the Bank, with such Donor&#13;
under this Administration Agreement, such Donor shall first ask IFC whether all or part of such relevant&#13;
information is disclosable under the AIP and then disclose only such information as IFC confirms may be&#13;
