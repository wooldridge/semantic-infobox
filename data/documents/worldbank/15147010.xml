Sector background and program overview                                                  In the pilot phase of the program, 80 million Kenya&#13;
Community run small-scale water systems play a critical                                 Shillings (K Shs) (US $ 1-million) was lent to ten&#13;
role in supplying consumers in the peri-urban and rural                                 community water projects, and with additional equity&#13;
areas of Kenya. The importance of these providers has been                              from the communities, this financed K Shs 100 million&#13;
recognized in recent reforms of the sector, which provide                               (US $ 1.3-million) of infrastructure. By November 2010,&#13;
for a legal and regulatory framework for community based                                all ten community projects had completed implementation&#13;
organizations to engage in water service provision outside                              and received K Shs 35 million (US $ 450,000) in output-&#13;
major towns and cities. However, these providers often                                  based aid subsidies, and moved into the operational loan&#13;
experience problems that hinder their ability to provide                                repayment phase of the project cycle. The operating and&#13;
reliable services to consumers and expand their coverage.                               financial performance of the ten projects has improved&#13;
Their most notable problems are limited management                                      significantly, with 36,000 consumers being served as of&#13;
capacity, low operating revenues and lack of access to                                  November 2010. This increased the coverage in the service&#13;
finance. Public funds to improve these systems are largely                              areas covered by these projects from 29 per cent to 41 per&#13;
absent, as these resources are allocated to developing new                              cent. The monthly volume of water production increased&#13;
water sources and systems in very low-income areas with                                 from 38,000 cubic meters to 85,000 cubic meters and the&#13;
poor access. Alternative financing mechanisms therefore                                 revenue collection tripled from K Shs 1.3 million (US $&#13;
have a crucial role to play in supplementing the sector                                 17,000) to K Shs 3.7 million (US $ 50,000) per month.&#13;
budget for rural water. At the same time, domestic banks                                The projects have been able to meet debt service costs from&#13;
do not typically finance investments in water infrastructure                            revenues generated from water sales.&#13;
because of the long term nature of infrastructure finance&#13;
and the perceived lack of creditworthiness of small-scale                               The successful pilot is being scaled up with additional&#13;
water providers.                                                                        subsidy funds of K Shs 180 million (US $ 2.2 million)&#13;

To address these challenges, a program to finance                                       Bank has committed a revolving credit facility of K Shs&#13;

    by the lender. The credit analysis must therefore establish                             debt service costs have been paid, to be able to contract&#13;
    financial viability from this perspective. It is the borrowerâ&#128;&#153;s                         with a private operator to manage their systems. However,&#13;

    project area that provides security to the lender. It allows                            project, the financial and operational performances of the&#13;
    the lender to require a change in management to secure                                  project have been significantly better than those managed&#13;
    debt service payments in the event of default.                                          by communities.&#13;

    2) The willingness and ability to pay for water must be                                 To improve the financial viability of community water&#13;
    evident among the consumers being served by the project.                                projects, the projects should be amalgamated and&#13;
    This is what drives the cash flows needed to repay the loan.                            specialized operators assigned to design, build, and then&#13;
    While the program targets communities in low-income                                     operate the systems under concession-type contracts for&#13;
    areas, consumers with individual water connections in                                   the duration of the implementation and loan repayment&#13;
    projects borrowing under the program pay an average                                     period. To bring economies of scale and scope to individual&#13;
    monthly water bill ranging from K Shs 600 to K Shs 1,500                                community water projects, each operator would need to&#13;
    (US $ 7 to US $ 18), depending on the operating and                                     manage a number of projects in geographical proximity&#13;
    debt service costs of each project. Residents who cannot                                under design-build-operate contracts. However it should&#13;
    afford individual connections benefit by being able to                                  be ensured that there are enough operators in the program&#13;
    purchase water from point water sources (kiosks) installed                              to promote competition. This arrangement will provide&#13;
    by a project at lower tariff rates than those prevailing in                             the necessary motivation for an operator to invest resources&#13;
    the area prior to the project. In appraising the financial                              into making the implementation and management of&#13;
    viability of a project, the lender must therefore be able to                            small piped water systems a viable business. Such contracts&#13;
    establish that consumers in the project area are willing and                            inherently contain incentives for an operator to ensure&#13;

    In Kenya, community run small-scale water systems play                             lack of creditworthiness of rural and peri-urban small-&#13;

    services in peri-urban and rural areas. This is largely because                    operations of community water projects (CWPs) have been&#13;
    municipally-owned water services providers currently                               hampered by the slow implementation of policies aimed&#13;

    Historically, under a centralized institutional structure, a&#13;
    large number of communities were tasked with managing                              To address these challenges, an innovative program that&#13;
    and recovering the operating costs of small piped water                            blends commercial debt and equity with subsidies to&#13;
    supply systems installed by government. The importance                             finance investments in community-managed piped water&#13;

    and cities. However, a host of problems complicate                                 in the development and management of small piped water&#13;
    efforts to support these community organizations to                                systems. It also aims to make community-run projects&#13;

     The pilot phase of the program has demonstrated that                                         decision. Training and support in developing project&#13;

     willingness to pay for piped water. On completion of                                         to support this innovative financing concept. A key factor&#13;

     showing the leveraging potential of the product. The                                         enough to produce sufficient income to cover the unique&#13;
     following valuable lessons from the pilot can be applied to                                  portfolio management costs. In this case, K-Rep Bank has&#13;

Experience from the pilot project suggests that communities                                  systems a viable business. A design-build-operate contract&#13;
lack the skills and experience needed to implement and                                       inherently contains an incentive for an operator to ensure&#13;

consultants that are tasked with implementing the projects                                   rather than the community. Under such an arrangement,&#13;
for the term of the loan in order to pass the operational                                    the operator would take on the obligation of repaying the&#13;

when most projects will experience significant cash stress                                   repayment is complete, which would mean the operator&#13;

With the considerable public financial resources available                       the loan repayment period should enable the communities&#13;
in the water sector, the size of the market for a loan-                          to optimize the operations of the systems so that they&#13;
linked product is likely to be limited over the medium                           continue to function efficiently in the post-loan phase&#13;

infrastructure required to effectively meet the demand for                       and could be leveraged to further expand service delivery.&#13;
water services: hence the increasing focus on cost recovery                      Programs targeting similar approaches should assess&#13;
tariffs and the considerable initiatives underway to access                      the market to ensure that there is a sufficient pipeline&#13;

In its pilot phase, the program has shown that Output                            warrant the establishment of a leveraging mechanism, and&#13;
Based Aid subsidies can be leveraged by two and half times                       that the legal framework offers the necessary protection&#13;

to expand water supply infrastructure in peri-urban and                          consideration needs to be given to institutionalizing&#13;
rural areas. The role of subsidies in improving affordability                    the support mechanisms needed to develop the project&#13;
where market financing is used to pay for infrastructure                         pipeline, especially if the program is to achieve sufficient&#13;

            Financing small piped water systems in
            rural and peri-urban Kenya
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In Kenya, community run small-scale
            water systems play a critical role in supplying and
            improving access to water services in peri-urban and rural
            areas. This is largely because municipally-owned water
            services providers currently supply only 25 per cent of the
            country's population and 39 per cent of the population
            within their service areas. Historically, under a
            centralized institutional structure, a large number of
            communities were tasked with managing and recovering the
            operating costs of small piped water supply systems
            installed by government. The importance of these community
            providers has been recognized in recent reforms of the
            sector. These provide for a legal and regulatory framework
            for community based organizations to engage in water service
            provision outside major towns and cities. However, a host of
            problems complicate efforts to support these community
            organizations to become reliable service providers,
            including their limited management capacity, low operating
            revenues and lack of access to finance. Efforts to license
            and regulate the operations of community water projects have
            been hampered by the slow implementation of policies aimed
            at decentralizing water service delivery to communities in
            areas not covered by municipal water services providers. In
            spite of considerable liquidity within the Kenyan financial
            sector, domestic banks do not typically finance investments
            in water infrastructure because of the long term nature of
            infrastructure finance and the perceived lack of
            creditworthiness of rural and peri-urban small scale water
            providers. Efforts to license and regulate the operations of
            community water projects (CWPs) have been hampered by the
            slow implementation of policies aimed at decentralizing
            water service delivery to communities in areas not covered
            by municipal water services providers. With the considerable
            public financial resources available in the water sector,
            the size of the market for a loan linked product is likely
            to be limited over the medium term. However, public funds
            are not sufficient to build the infrastructure required to
            effectively meet the demand for water services: hence the
            increasing focus on cost recovery tariffs and the
            considerable initiatives underway to access supplementary
            financial resources from the private sector.
