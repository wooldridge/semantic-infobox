&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
One of the responses to new challenges in the labor market has been the development and&#13;
expansion of employment services and active labor market policies based on activation&#13;
principles. The objective of this study is to document and review international experiences,&#13;
predominantly from selected emerging market economies and developing countries, with the&#13;
design and implementation of activation programs, provided by Public Employment Services,&#13;
through the prism of incentives and sanctions. Employment promotion legislation from the&#13;
reviewed countries is a major source of information. Participation of beneficiaries in relevant&#13;
services and programs is also analyzed. The study finds that the countries use a variety of&#13;
instruments, be it specific employment services, active labor market programs, or benefit and&#13;
other sanctions, to â&#128;&#156;activateâ&#128;? jobseekers with an aim to encourage them to become more&#13;
active in their efforts to find work and/or improve their employability. In practice, the&#13;
activation policies vary considerably across countries.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
As countries emerge from the financial crisis there are growing demands for advice regarding&#13;
the design of policies and programs that can facilitate access to jobs and reduce dependency.&#13;
Part of the concern is about reactivating individuals who have lost their jobs as a result of the&#13;
economic downturn (some of whom avail of unemployment benefits) and helping new labor&#13;
market entrants find jobs. But there are also concerns about how to improve the labor market&#13;
and earnings opportunities of beneficiaries of welfare programs.&#13;
&#13;
One of the responses to new challenges in the labor market has been the development and&#13;
expansion of employment services and active labor market policies based on activation&#13;
principles. In particular, welfare reform legislation in the United States (US) in 1996 and the&#13;
Luxembourg Employment Guidelines adopted by the European Union (EU) in 1997 were key&#13;
events defining the vision of such policies whereby benefit recipients are expected to look&#13;
actively for work or participate in a program to promote their job prospects (OECD 2005).&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Activation policiesâ&#128;? encourage jobseekers and other vulnerable groups to become more active&#13;
in finding work and/or improving their employability, including investing in their own skills (see&#13;
for example, OECD 2007). 1 The essence of activation is in many countries increasingly based on&#13;
the principle of â&#128;&#156;mutual obligations.â&#128;? The principle states that, in return for receiving income&#13;
support (unemployment benefits and other related entitlements or social safety nets) and&#13;
being offered a range of (re-)employment services, individuals must commit and comply with a&#13;
set of eligibility requirements (for instance, active jobsearch behavior) and participate in&#13;
training or other (re)employment programs. So, in order to ensure effective assistance, income&#13;
support should be accompanied by an appropriate set of rights and duties.&#13;
&#13;
The activation programs discussed in this study encompass actions at the local level by the&#13;
public employment services (PES) and other government agencies (such as those providing&#13;
social assistance) targeted at people of working age either to (i) incentivize and help individuals&#13;
find jobs (when unemployed or inactive) or (ii) help individuals access better jobs (when&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
 Employability is a concept referring to terms used to assess the ability of a person to access a job. This concept is&#13;
one element in the European Employment Strategy first adopted by the EU Member States in 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          1&#13;
&amp;#12;underemployed or working in very low-productivity and low-paid activities) (see Almeida et al.&#13;
2012 for details).&#13;
&#13;
Activation policies often take the form of incentives and sanctions. The incentive structure&#13;
encompasses a broad range of features, from the rules for early registration to related&#13;
activation and monitoring measures to eligibility rules for benefits and other entitlements (21&#13;
different benefits and entitlements in the reviewed countries were identified). Sanctions also&#13;
take various forms, from non-granting of the unemployment insurance benefit to exclusion&#13;
from the roster of unemployed. We have identified seven different forms of sanctions; their&#13;
imposition largely depends on the institutional capacity of PES to monitor the activities of&#13;
jobseekers and enforce rules and regulations.&#13;
&#13;
The objective of this study is to document and review international experiences, predominantly&#13;
from the emerging market economies and developing countries, with the design and&#13;
implementation of activation programs through the prism of incentives and sanctions&#13;
embedded in employment promotion legislation. 2 The participation of beneficiaries in relevant&#13;
services and programs is also analyzed, as much as the available data allow. The data on&#13;
program beneficiaries are mostly from the countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA).&#13;
&#13;
Sources of information for this report include, inter alia, employment promotion laws and&#13;
relevant policies in the reviewed countries, and studies conducted by the Organization for&#13;
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Commission (EC), and the&#13;
World Bank (the Bank). It should be noted that actual practices might deviate from what is&#13;
written in the law since the PES may lack the ability or the resources to enforce the law.&#13;
&#13;
More broadly, the target groups for activation policies are those persons who are registered by&#13;
national public employment services as jobseekers, be it unemployed jobseekers or&#13;
jobchangers, or persons who are currently employed but at risk of involuntary job loss due to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
  Employment promotion legislation from the following countries was available to us: Albania, Armenia,&#13;
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Kyrgyz Republic, Estonia,&#13;
Hungary, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Peru, Russia,&#13;
Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Tunisia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       2&#13;
&amp;#12;difficult economic circumstances for their employer. Certain incentives but also sanctions have&#13;
been established for employers participating in programs financed by PES.&#13;
&#13;
Activation of jobseekers is a labor intensive activity. Moreover, activation policy interventions&#13;
should be tailored to the needs of the labor market and jobseekers themselves. The&#13;
composition and level of unemployment vary significantly depending on the country. What&#13;
makes the policies challenging is that client groups are heterogeneous, with many â&#128;&#156;special&#13;
cases.â&#128;? Several major groups of jobseekers are especially difficult to employ, including, among&#13;
others: (i) the long-term unemployed; (ii) youth; (iii) those with low levels of education, and&#13;
with only general education (e.g., without vocational/professional skills); and (iv) those&#13;
representing national minorities. In many countries, these groups form the major part of&#13;
registered unemployment. Many of these jobless have no qualifications; they may have&#13;
multiple employment barriers, including cognitive and health-related barriers, and difficult&#13;
home lives (e.g., lack of transportation, many children, childcare problems, domestic violence).&#13;
&#13;
Individuals may face many other constraints preventing their access to productive employment.&#13;
These may relate to lack of the right skills set, information gaps, working capital constraints, or&#13;
mobility constraints. Most often individuals face not one but rather multiple constraints (for the&#13;
typology of barriers and constraints to work, see Almeida et al. 2012).&#13;
&#13;
De facto, a significant portion of the long-term unemployed, if not working informally, have&#13;
completely lost touch with the labor market. Some prefer to become inactive rather than&#13;
having to participate in labor market programs to comply with activation policy requirements.&#13;
Given the often-weak enforcement capacity of PES in implementing activation measures,&#13;
reaching and monitoring these groups are especially problematic.&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, the main target groups for activation programs are recipients (or claimants) of&#13;
income-replacement benefits that are conditional on availability for work. In the reviewed&#13;
countries, many incentives and sanctions associated with participation in employment services&#13;
and alternative labor market programs (ALMP) have been established for jobseekers who may&#13;
have access to entitlements other than unemployment benefits (e.g., health insurance or social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                3&#13;
&amp;#12;assistance) or for persons with no entitlements at all, such as, first-time jobseekers or the long-&#13;
term unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
Not all the countries with PES have unemployment benefit schemes that limit the scope of&#13;
activation policies. According to the Doing Business Worker Protection Measure (WPM) 2012&#13;
survey, out of the total of 176 economies in the sample, only 86 have contributory&#13;
unemployment benefit schemes; 33 economies have non-contributory arrangements to&#13;
provide unemployment protection to workers not covered by the general provisions&#13;
(unemployment assistance schemes), all of which have unemployment insurance in the first&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
The presence of unemployment benefit schemes is strongly related to the level of&#13;
development. Out of 32 low income countries screened by the WPM survey, only Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic, Liberia, Malawi, Nepal, Tajikistan, and Tanzania provide unemployment insurance;&#13;
Tajikistan also has an unemployment assistance scheme. Among the lower middle income&#13;
countries, 74 percent do not have an unemployment insurance scheme. In contrast, 79 percent&#13;
of the high income countries and 62 percent of the upper middle income countries feature&#13;
some unemployment benefit system.&#13;
&#13;
In middle and low income countries, the design and implementation of activation programs&#13;
face two other challenges. One is the fact that very few of the unemployed are registered in&#13;
employment services and receiving unemployment benefits. But even among those countries&#13;
that have implemented unemployment benefits schemes, take-up rates are often small. The&#13;
other problem in most of the reviewed countries is that employment services and active labor&#13;
market programs are, in general, underdeveloped and institutional capacity is weak. For&#13;
instance, the staff caseload â&#128;&#147; the ratio of clients to employment counseling staff â&#128;&#147; is a critical&#13;
constraint to PES performance in many countries. Therefore, stronger activation of jobseekers&#13;
and especially of unemployment benefit recipients requires higher spending on PES offices and&#13;
staff. Also common is the fact that monitoring systems are almost nonexistent and only a&#13;
handful of programs have been evaluated rigorously.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                4&#13;
&amp;#12;Activation strategies to be discussed in this report feature, inter alia: (i) mechanisms to&#13;
stimulate the early registration of jobseekers at PES and to expand the coverage of jobseekers&#13;
by PES; (ii) early interventions by PES in the unemployment spell and a high contact density&#13;
between jobseekers and employment counselors; (iii) incentives for regular reporting and&#13;
monitoring of work availability and jobsearch actions; (iv) setting-up back-to-work agreements&#13;
or individual action plans; (v) practices for the definition of a suitable job; (vi) incentives for&#13;
participation in ALMPs, including in training, receiving wage subsidies or assistance for self-&#13;
employment and entrepreneurship, participating in public works, and establishing special&#13;
programs for high-risk groups of jobseekers; (vii) eligibility and entitlement rules for the&#13;
benefits associated with activation measures; and (viii) and a wide range of sanctions imposed&#13;
by law on those jobseekers who do not obey active job-search requirements.&#13;
&#13;
The report is structured as follows. Chapter 1 focuses on the administration of labor market&#13;
programs and the capacity of PES in implementing activation policies; incentives for jobseekers&#13;
and employers associated with registration at PES, as well as incentives related to the provision&#13;
of employment services, including the menu of services for various categories of beneficiaries.&#13;
Chapter 2 examines incentives for jobseekers, service providers, and employers in the provision&#13;
of and participation in ALMPs, and coverage of beneficiaries with relevant programs. Chapter 3&#13;
discusses eligibility for unemployment benefits, recipient rates, types of benefits available, and&#13;
incentives to receive benefits and other entitlements. Chapter 4 examines benefits and other&#13;
sanctions utilized in the reviewed countries. The report ends with some concluding remarks.&#13;

&amp;#12;I. Employment Services in Support of Activation&#13;
&#13;
1.1. Administration of Activation Policies and Institutional Constraints of PES&#13;
&#13;
This chapter focuses on the administration of labor market programs, and the capacity of&#13;
PES in implementing activation policies. Incentives for jobseekers and employers associated&#13;
with registration at the PES will be discussed, as well as incentives related to the provision&#13;
of employment services. The menu of services for various categories of beneficiaries will&#13;
also be analyzed. In particular, a flexicurity approach implies that PES should adopt a&#13;
preventive and proactive approach to support early identification of skills needs, jobsearch&#13;
assistance, guidance, and training. Most European PES put great importance on a&#13;
preventive approach based on early identification of needs and risks of unemployed people.&#13;
Key measures towards this aim include early profiling of unemployed people, regular&#13;
personalized follow-up procedures, and a broad spectrum of active labor market measures&#13;
as a component of a rights- and duty-oriented labor market policy (see EC 2009).&#13;
&#13;
Employment services to be discussed can be grouped into the following categories:&#13;
   (i) Placement services&#13;
   (ii) Counseling&#13;
   (iii) Specialized services&#13;
   (iv) ICT services&#13;
   (v) Services to employers.&#13;
&#13;
Activation policies are constrained by the fact that public employment services in most of&#13;
the reviewed countries are facing a number of severe problems. First, they increasingly face&#13;
tight public budgets and lack funding for their normal operations. Second, they are often&#13;
understaffed and heavily constrained by a fragmented network of employment offices.&#13;
Third, in many countries, the set of functions available are dated and limited both in&#13;
number and scope. Fourth, the PES often does not have access to labor market information&#13;
and the wide range of modern ALMPs and techniques. Fifth, the lack of modern ICT severely&#13;
limits the administration of benefits and programs as well as the potential for monitoring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              6&#13;
&amp;#12;and evaluation of service delivery. Sixth, program evaluation has been weak, and only in a&#13;
few countries, has a net impact analysis of ALMPs provided by PES been conducted (Kuddo&#13;
2009a). In these circumstances the design and implementation of labor market policies&#13;
based on activation principles is especially challenging.&#13;
&#13;
In high-income countries and in the emerging market economies, it is public employment&#13;
services (PES) â&#128;&#147; national public or governmental bodies â&#128;&#147; that are responsible for activities&#13;
related to the implementation of labor market policies. PES deliver employment services&#13;
free of charge to jobseekers (both unemployed and jobchangers) as well as some services to&#13;
employers and the inactive population. PES in many countries are working in close&#13;
cooperation with social benefits organizations, social partners, private service providers,&#13;
temporary work agencies, educational institutions, and other public organizations and non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGO) (see EC 2009 for details).&#13;
&#13;
Public employment services typically function as an independent government implementing&#13;
agency in the provision of relevant services. They operate quite autonomously within the&#13;
established legal framework and operating budgets. Usually, the line ministry is responsible&#13;
for policy-related issues, including the legislative framework and budgeting. While PES are&#13;
structured differently in each country, all share the same basic task of contributing towards&#13;
matching supply and demand in the labor market through the provision of information,&#13;
counseling, placement services, and active labor market programs. Some PES are&#13;
responsible for providing training to jobseekers and/or managing unemployment benefits&#13;
(EC 2009; MISSOC 2009).&#13;
&#13;
Public employment services emerged in the early 1990s in most of the transition countries,&#13;
in response to massive labor market adjustments in the economy associated with&#13;
restructuring and privatization of state-owned enterprises. Typically, PES in these countries&#13;
are responsible for all aspects of employment services and programs: registering the&#13;
unemployed, paying unemployment benefits, providing guidance and counseling to&#13;
jobseekers, and coming up with ALMPs like training, wage subsidies, or public works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               7&#13;
&amp;#12;In the developing countries, most active labor market programs, if any, are provided&#13;
through either governmental/quasi-governmental bodies or NGOs. The former often suffer&#13;
from limited efficiency, skewed targeting, and a heavy reliance on donor support while the&#13;
latter usually are limited in scope or poorly integrated into a policy framework (Fargues and&#13;
MartÃ­n 2009).&#13;
&#13;
The role of PES in overall job placement tends to be rather limited in most of the reviewed&#13;
countries, despite the fact that even at times of economic downturn in many countries, a&#13;
significant portion of the registered jobseekers were able to find a job, mostly on their own.&#13;
The best performer among the reviewed countries in this respect is Belarus, which was not&#13;
impacted by the global crisis: the Belarusian PES registered the placement of 130,000&#13;
jobseekers in 2009 as compared to the average annual number of the registered jobseekers&#13;
of 42,000 (Figure 1; Kuddo 2010). This was due to an abundant number of vacant jobs,&#13;
predominantly in state-owned enterprises but also in the informal sector.&#13;

&amp;#12;However, PES have limits to what they can accomplish, and not every jobseeker can be&#13;
supported to find appropriate placement or participate in labor market programs. Even in&#13;
high income countries, the majority of workers rely solely on personal and family&#13;
connections as the main way to find suitable employers, and many job placements occur&#13;
without an intermediation role of PES. An example from Estonia follows.&#13;
&#13;
In 2006 in Estonia, 16,324 unemployed persons were employed during the year, that is, 34&#13;
percent of all persons registered as unemployed; 10,533 unemployed persons or, 64&#13;
percent of the total, found work independently, of which 61 individuals started an&#13;
independent business; 5,211 unemployed persons (32 percent) were placed in jobs&#13;
following a referral by the Labor Market Board; and through services that enhance&#13;
employment (wage subsidy, business start-up subsidy, working with a support person, and&#13;
working with special aids and equipment), only 580 unemployed persons or, 4 percent,&#13;
were employed. 3 Therefore, the role of ALMPs in job placements, based on this example, is&#13;
minimal.&#13;
&#13;
The number of jobseekers looking for a job through PES is low in most developing countries.&#13;
For example, in Lebanon and Yemen only a fraction of all workers find a job through public&#13;
or private labor offices (0.3 percent and 2.8 percent of the workers, respectively). In other&#13;
countries, like Egypt and Iraq, between 30 and 50 percent of all workers find a job through&#13;
intermediation services, highlighting the potential of labor intermediation to reduce&#13;
frictional unemployment even in environments of generalized job scarcity (Figure 2).&#13;
&#13;
Another challenge facing the most vulnerable is that the PES services are often geared&#13;
towards activities with high unit costs, and relatively few jobseekers participate and benefit&#13;
from these programs. Moreover, a recent study on ALMPs in Arab Mediterranean countries&#13;
(AMC) indicated that skills enhancement programs mainly benefit highly-educated workers&#13;
who might be more motivated to participate in the programs and, thus, contribute to even&#13;
higher inequities in labor market opportunities and lower mobility (Angel-Urdinola, Semlali,&#13;

&amp;#12;and Broadman 2010). The study also found that in many countries, more cost-effective&#13;
counseling and labor intermediation programs hardly exist.&#13;

Staff of the PES. An important factor contributing to the success of activation policies is the&#13;
institutional capacity of national employment services, including the network of offices,&#13;
legal framework in which they operate, and especially the professional level of the staff at&#13;
the local employment offices.&#13;
&#13;
In particular, the staff caseload â&#128;&#147; the ratio of clients to employment counseling staff â&#128;&#147; is a&#13;
critical constraint to PES performance in many countries. Within the European Union, the&#13;
average staff caseload is around 1:150, while the figure recommended by the ILO is even&#13;
lower, 1:100. In Kosovo, the staff caseload is enormous: close to 2,000 registered&#13;
unemployed per 1 PES staff (Figure 3).&#13;

The situation might be much worse in developing countries. In 2009 in selected MENA&#13;
countries, the highest staff caseload was reported in Syria, exceeding 14,000 registered&#13;
jobseekers per one PES staff (young Syrians were queuing for employment in the public&#13;
sector through PES), followed by Morocco, at over 1,500 jobseekers, and Lebanon at over&#13;
1,200 registered jobseekers per one staff. The high number of caseloads does not allow the&#13;
PES to deliver personalized job intermediation services (Table 1).&#13;

*** The average number of registered unemployed per PES staff.&#13;
&#13;
As a result, the situation leaves little time to be spent on each unemployed person. In&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the average varied from 4 to 6 minutes per unemployed person in&#13;
the worst cases (Employment Services in Tuzla Canton, District of Brcko, and Una Sana&#13;
Canton) and up to 19 minutes per unemployed person in Republika Srpska. The average&#13;
staff size is three persons per office in both; whereas in many offices, there are only one to&#13;
two employees (Kuddo 2008).&#13;
&#13;
Available data show wide variations in the levels of staffing among ECA countries. The&#13;
differences are explained by the types and quality of services offered. By the end of 2009,&#13;
the highest staff caseload was reported in Kosovoâ&#128;&#148;on average 1,862 registered&#13;
unemployed per one PES staff, followed by FYR Macedonia, at 669 unemployed per one&#13;
staff. In contrast, the staff caseload was only 35 registered unemployed per one PES staff in&#13;
Belarus (2008), 52 unemployed in Russia (2009), and 56 unemployed in Ukraine per one PES&#13;
staff (2008; Annex I, Tables AI.1 and AI.2). Compared to 2008, several ECA countries have&#13;
found resources to increase the number of staff in the PES. For example, in Estonia, the&#13;
number of staff increased from 352 to 455 in 2009 and in Russia, from 36,400 to 42,300.&#13;
&#13;
What really matters for the delivery of services to the unemployed is the proportion of staff&#13;
in direct contact with the clients (i.e., caseworkers and their workload). Out of the total PES&#13;
staff in Croatia, FYR Macedonia, and Slovenia, only around half are front-line employment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     12&#13;
&amp;#12;counselors/advisors. In Azerbaijan, 90 percent of PES staff work directly with jobseekers and&#13;
employers, in Moldova the number is 87 percent, and in Bulgaria the number is 84 percent.&#13;
Instead of increasing the number of PES staff, several countries (Latvia, Bulgaria, Moldova,&#13;
and Azerbaijan) have increased the number of front-liners out of the total.&#13;
&#13;
Thereby, in many of the reviewed countries, the number of front-line counselors/advisers is&#13;
inadequate for delivering ALMPs, specifically effective and personalized mediation services.&#13;
High caseload limits the implementation of policies based on activation principles, including&#13;
regular reporting and confirmation of unemployment status by jobseekers, as well as&#13;
opportunities for job counselors to monitor and encourage jobsearch and deliver&#13;
information.&#13;
&#13;
The efficiency and quality of service could be improved markedly by placing more PES staff&#13;
on the frontline, for example, through job rotation, dealing with clients and working in&#13;
different specialized areas and by eliminating tasks not suitable for PES (registration of&#13;
employment contracts, issuance of health insurance cards), and so on. Further&#13;
improvements in efficiency could be achieved by setting up â&#128;&#156;monitorableâ&#128;? performance&#13;
targets and improving collection of administrative data (Kuddo 2009b).&#13;
&#13;
Financing of PES activities. Employment services in many countries operate in a very&#13;
difficult environment of demand-deficient labor markets and in several countries, double-&#13;
digit unemployment rates. Services are limited and programs are underfunded.&#13;
Employment programs are often geared towards activities with high unit costs and low&#13;
participation.&#13;
&#13;
The efficiency of the state employment policy is to a large extent related to the resources&#13;
available for financing labor market programs. While the funding of ALMPs was limited and&#13;
did not exceed 0.1-0.2 percent of GDP in most of the reviewed countries (except EU 10), the&#13;
emphasis should be put on improving the design and effectiveness of ALMPs, rather than on&#13;
increasing spending levels only.&#13;

The countries usually finance labor market policies through general revenues, payroll taxes,&#13;
or a combination of the two. For example, most EU10 countries rely on earmarked&#13;
employment taxes to finance labor market policies and programs. In Slovenia, programs are&#13;
predominantly financed from the budget (around 90 percent of the costs). The Czech&#13;
Republic, Poland, and Romania (until 2010) finance employment programs largely through&#13;
the employment tax but shortfalls are covered from the state budget. In Estonia,&#13;
unemployment insurance benefits are financed from contributions but noncontributory&#13;
unemployment allowance is tax financed. In Malta, financing labor market programs is&#13;
included in the overall social contribution.&#13;
&#13;
Notably, during the peak of the crisis in 2009, Estonia increased the employment tax from&#13;
0.9 percent at the beginning of the year to 4.2 percent since August 2009 (Table 3). In&#13;
Bulgaria, the state budget pays contributions (one percent gross earnings) on behalf of civil&#13;
servants, soldiers and other military personnel, and the judiciary including judges,&#13;
prosecutors, investigators, bailiffs, and court employees.&#13;

Some countries have an established assessment base ceiling for employment contributions.&#13;
In Bulgaria, the minimum amount of the contributory income per month varies according to&#13;
occupation and industrial branch; the maximum ceiling is set at BGN 2,000 (â&#130;¬ 1,023) per&#13;
month. In the Czech Republic, the ceiling is established at 72 multiplied by the monthly&#13;
average wage of CZK 1,781,280 (â&#130;¬ 73,465) per annum (MISSOC 2011).&#13;
&#13;
Contrary to emerging market economies and developing countries, high income countries&#13;
spend significant resources on labor market interventions. Across the EU, a total of â&#130;¬ 256&#13;
billion, or 2.2 percent of EU-27 GDP, was spent on labor market polices (LMP) in 2009 â&#128;&#147; a&#13;
year of economic downturn. There was, however, considerable variation between member&#13;
states (see Table 4). A major part of its LMP expenditure (64 percent in 2009 or, â&#130;¬ 164&#13;
billion) went to income support for out-of-work jobseekers, primarily in the form of&#13;
unemployment benefits.&#13;
&#13;
Expenditure on LMP services in 2009 represented around 11 percent of total LMP&#13;
expenditure or, 0.23 percent of EU-27 GDP. The United Kingdom is the only country where&#13;
about half of LMP expenditure is spent on LMP services. This reflects the policy approach to&#13;
focus on support for active jobsearch and to reserve placement in full-time measures for&#13;
those most in need.&#13;

Registered vacancies. During the recent economic downturn, the surge in registered&#13;
unemployment was accompanied by other negative trends. The number of job vacancies&#13;
offered by employment services dropped significantly, and the ratio of jobseekers to one&#13;
registered vacancy rapidly worsened. In December 2009 in Kosovo, it was reported that&#13;
more than 800 jobseekers competed for one vacancy, and in Albania, Armenia, and Latvia,&#13;
around 100 or more jobseekers were registered per one vacancy. The only exception was&#13;
Belarus, where the number of registered vacancies in late 2009 almost equaled the number&#13;
of registered jobseekers (Figure 4).&#13;
&#13;
Many employers only register a vacancy if they believe that there are qualified, skilled&#13;
workers who can apply for it. So too, employers may have enough applicants without ever&#13;
advertizing job vacancies. Another reason is that employers, especially in SMEs, prefer to&#13;
hire based on a referral from someone they trust.&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, according to available data, the bulk of PES-registered vacancies are for low-paid&#13;
blue collar jobs offering around the minimum wage for unskilled labor, work under harmful&#13;
conditions, and in public sector enterprises, which make them unattractive among&#13;
jobseekers. Many job offers are not accepted because they do not fit the criteria of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                16&#13;
&amp;#12;suitable job (see below). Often, there is a mismatch between the qualifications of&#13;
jobseekers and proposed job offers. High wage expectations (reservation wage) might also&#13;
limit acceptance of job offers proposed by the PES.&#13;
&#13;
Thus, under the current circumstances, very few jobseekers have a chance not only of&#13;
finding a good job but of finding any job at all. In Belarus, in late 2009, every fourth&#13;
registered jobseeker found a job in one month, yet in most other countries, the ratio was&#13;
much lower, not exceeding one to five percent per month (Annex I, Table AI.3).&#13;
&#13;
The lack of job offers has a major impact on the efficacy of activation policies implemented&#13;
by PES, but it also could lead to longer unemployment spells for many jobseekers in the&#13;
coming years.&#13;

&amp;#12;Private sector involvement. Traditionally, PES had a near monopoly status in most&#13;
countries, being the only institution providing job-brokering as the main employment&#13;
service (Freedland et al. 2007). However, in the globalizing world, the labor market has&#13;
become so complex that no single service provider can possibly deliver the range of&#13;
expertise required for the diverse group of unemployed and employed jobseekers, inactive&#13;
groups, and employers. PES increasingly need to cooperate with a plethora of institutions to&#13;
deliver pro-active and preventive employment services, be it private employment agencies,&#13;
training and education institutions, local authorities, employersâ&#128;&#153; organizations, NGOs, etc.&#13;
PES need to assume the role of manager of relations with the various institutions and&#13;
external service providers (EC 2009).&#13;
&#13;
Going forward, a more active involvement of the private sector in the provision of labor&#13;
market services such as training, job brokerage, and other services, should be considered as&#13;
an integral part of PES reform. This trend was recognized and further boosted by the Private&#13;
Employment Agency Convention adopted by the International Labor Organization in 1997&#13;
(Convention 181 supported by Recommendation 188). It allows for lower pressure on public&#13;
budgets and provides a wider array of options for a diverse range of clients.&#13;
&#13;
As an example, the Netherlands has implemented a full-scale tendering model, meaning&#13;
that all target groups of jobseekers are referred to external service providers and that the&#13;
PES has stopped providing traditional employment services to the unemployed. Public&#13;
authorities are instead used as gate-keepers in the quasi-market and to pay out social&#13;
security benefits (Bredgaard and Larsen 2008). Australia has been outsourcing services to&#13;
private and NGO-type agencies since the 1990s. Under its Job Network, hundreds of&#13;
licensed job placement organizations in more than 2,700 locations across Australia offer&#13;
placement services to the unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
In 2003, the Australian government introduced the Active Participation Model (APM) for&#13;
jobseekers, adopting a more intensive and individualized approach to placing jobseekers&#13;
through Australiaâ&#128;&#153;s Job Network service outsourcing system. Service providers are offered&#13;
paid incentives to place jobseekers in work. Payments for the more difficult to place clients&#13;
are higher than those for the short-term unemployed clients (Tergeist and Grubb 2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             18&#13;
&amp;#12;Service contracts with private providers typically include a performance-based element with&#13;
placement incentives for providers. The rationale is to cover a providerâ&#128;&#153;s base costs but to&#13;
offer a placement incentive through an outcome-dependent bonus. For instance, the British&#13;
Jobcentre Plus pays contractors on the basis of the sustainability of jobs and the ability of&#13;
contractors. The payments to contractors are composed of a range of criteria, including:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Job outcome (off-flow from benefit into employment)&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Sustainability of jobs (customer still being in work after 13/26 weeks).&#13;
&#13;
This â&#128;&#156;Work First Plusâ&#128;&#159; model focuses not only on getting individuals off benefits into work&#13;
but combines this with an emphasis on ensuring that the individuals stay in the job and&#13;
progress in the labor market. Based on policy reviews, the model is expected to expand the&#13;
sustainability of payments beyond 13 weeks (EC 2009).&#13;
&#13;
Some countries in the ECA region are also actively moving in this direction. By 2009,&#13;
according to the national PES, there were 587 private employment agencies registered in&#13;
Bulgaria, 63 in Latvia, 41 in Lithuania, 51 in Slovenia, but 2,176 in the Czech Republic and&#13;
over 2,800 in Poland.&#13;
&#13;
Some developing countries are actively involving the private sector in the provision of labor&#13;
market services such as training, job brokerage, and other services, as an integral part of&#13;
PES reform. It allows for lower pressure on public budgets and provides a wider array of&#13;
options for a diverse range of clients. By the PES survey data, there are 45 licensed private&#13;
employment agencies in Jordan and 54 private agencies in Egypt. Labor market programs&#13;
are subcontracted to external providers also in Lebanon, as well. In other countries, publicâ&#128;&#147;&#13;
private partnerships are limited and in some cases even against the law (e.g., Tunisia). While&#13;
in others, NGOs are active in the provision of employment services and ALMPs, such as in&#13;
Yemen with 150 registered NGOs working in the field of employment.&#13;
&#13;
Performance management. The efficiency of PES operations can be improved by setting up&#13;
monitorable performance targets using the administrative data generated by PES activities&#13;
(e.g., number of individuals served, types of interventions, follow-up, etc.) at various levels.&#13;
Key performance indicators may include quantitative indicators: the number of visitors to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              19&#13;
&amp;#12;the local employment offices, registered jobseekers, participants in ALMPs, placements, and&#13;
job vacancies filled within a certain time; increasing the PES market share of notified&#13;
vacancies; and reducing the incidence of long-term (over one year) and very long-term (two&#13;
years or more) unemployment. Key performance indicators also may include qualitative&#13;
indicators: client satisfaction (jobseekers and employers) with PES services; establishment&#13;
of a database of employers; and so on. 4 A few examples follow.&#13;
&#13;
The labor market in the United Kingdom is overseen and managed in a goal-oriented&#13;
approach (management by objectives â&#128;&#147; MBO), under which annual targets are specified in&#13;
operational terms on a quantitative basis. The goals and funding are defined by the&#13;
government and set down in a Public Service Agreement. A differentiated system of&#13;
ongoing monitoring of results and goal-related feedback on results enables the oversight&#13;
entities to intervene early where needed, so as to take corrective or countering action.&#13;
Goals and funding are decided annually by the government (DWP) and the Treasury, and set&#13;
forth in the Public Service Agreement. Information about regional and national&#13;
developments and events is updated weekly. Official reports are prepared monthly. Reports&#13;
on the status of goal achievements are submitted to the DWP quarterly. Output indicators&#13;
include unemployed persons placed (job entries)/placement counselor per week or persons&#13;
placed (job entries)/registered job openings. The Diagnostic Tool Kit is designed to show an&#13;
employment officeâ&#128;&#153;s current placement performance relative to the average performance&#13;
of comparable offices from the prior year. This instrument enables the Jobcentres to&#13;
determine clearly where they stand.&#13;
&#13;
Probably the most elaborate performance management system has been developed by the&#13;
Austrian PES (Arbeitsmarktservice â&#128;&#147; AMS). The AMS scorecard integrates labor market&#13;
policy goals with process and resource management, client and staff satisfaction, and the&#13;
dimensions of management and equal opportunity at the AMS. Twenty-four indicators have&#13;
been developed for the areas of jobseeker service, business service, job-market and career&#13;
information, management, and support. Measurements are taken at the level of the local&#13;
&#13;

Evaluation of employment programs. Even if the employment services and measures are&#13;
available, the performance of many of the programs has been disappointing. In particular,&#13;
several authors have carried out meta evaluations of the international evaluation literature&#13;
(Heckman et al. 1999, De Koning et al. 2005, Kluve 2006, De Koning and Peers 2007,&#13;
Betcherman et al. 2007). The general outcome is that the net impacts found vary&#13;
considerably (see also Table 5). On average, the effects found are close to zero. So, the&#13;
overall picture emerging from the literature is not very positive.&#13;

On the other hand, international experience suggests that employment services (including&#13;
career guidance counseling services and various jobsearch assistance programs, such as&#13;
jobsearch skills training programs, job clubs, vacancy and job fairs) are the most cost-&#13;
efficient and effective ALMPs, given that a reasonably buoyant supply of job vacancies is&#13;
available (Kluve 2006, Betcherman et al. 2007, Lehmann and Kluve 2008).&#13;

&amp;#12;However, even if labor market outcomes are not affected, it is still possible that the&#13;
program entails positive effects for a participant (De Koning et al. 2008). Such effects could&#13;
be:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Increase in well-being as a result of the social contacts obtained during participation&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Increase in well-being as a result of the work done during the project in the case of a&#13;
          public works program&#13;
      â&#128;¢   increased skills obtained during the program that can be used in the personal&#13;
          sphere.&#13;

1.2. Registration of Jobseekers at PES&#13;
&#13;
Motives and the level of registration. Registration for placement at PES is, in most&#13;
countries, a precondition for unemployment benefit payment but also to gain access to&#13;
employment services and labor market measures. Various reasons motivate individuals to&#13;
register at employment service offices: to secure a new job through job listings and other&#13;
employment services; to participate and benefit from active labor market programs; and to&#13;
receive unemployment benefits and other entitlements, such as to maintain eligibility for&#13;
health insurance benefits, even for many who are de facto inactive or informally employed.&#13;
&#13;
Some reviewed countries (e.g., CEE, the Balkans) entice the registration of persons who are&#13;
not actively looking for jobs. The incentives in other countries do are too low to be enticing&#13;
(e.g., CIS). Getting the balance right so that the actual jobseekers â&#128;&#156;self-selectâ&#128;? into&#13;
registration is critical to employment services being effective in supporting jobseekers.&#13;
&#13;
In about half of the countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA), registered&#13;
unemployment rates exceed survey-based unemployment, including in most countries in&#13;
Central Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans, largely due to health insurance&#13;
entitlements. For example, in Croatia in 2009, the number of registered unemployed was 65&#13;
percent higher than the number of survey-based active jobseekers (Figure 5; Kuddo 2011).&#13;
&#13;
Several reasons explain this phenomenon. Unemployed persons who wish to retain&#13;
eligibility for state-provided health insurance benefits (if not insured through employed&#13;
family members) are often required to register at PES. In FYR Macedonia in 2009, around 25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                22&#13;
&amp;#12;percent of the total registered unemployed were registering only for the purpose of&#13;
receiving free health insurance and were not actively searching for a job.&#13;
&#13;
In many emerging market economies, unemployed persons of working age who are eligible&#13;
for income-conditioned support payments (social assistance) usually are required to register&#13;
at PES. Respectively, the mandatory requirement of â&#128;&#156;unemployed statusâ&#128;? required for&#13;
obtaining the status of social welfare beneficiary is also causing the registration of persons&#13;
who do not classify as unemployed according to international standards.&#13;
&#13;
For example, in the Czech Republic, willingness to work is the basic condition of being&#13;
treated as a person in material need. Recipients, unless employed or in a similar&#13;
relationship, must register with the labor office as jobseekers actively look for a job, accept&#13;
any (even short-term or less-well paid) employment, participate in active employment&#13;
policy programs, public works, and public service etc. Participation in these activities is&#13;
obligatory and is subject to examination. Refusal means that the person is expelled.&#13;
&#13;
In Estonia, the local government may refuse to grant the subsistence benefit to those&#13;
capable of working and between 18 years old and pensionable age, who are neither&#13;
working nor studying and have repeatedly refused, without due cause, offers of suitable&#13;
work or have refused to attend employment services, social services, or training courses&#13;
(MISSOC 2011).&#13;

&#13;
Also, employed individuals who are looking for another job can register as jobseekers, but&#13;
they have limited access to the employment services (see below).&#13;
&#13;
By comparison, in other countries, particularly in the Baltic States and Commonwealth of&#13;
Independent States (CIS), registered unemployment is much lower than survey-based&#13;
unemployment, predominantly due to low access to unemployment benefits and active&#13;
labor market programs. For example, in Kazakhstan, only 15 percent of the unemployed&#13;
register with PES (2009) and in Armenia, 16 percent (2008). In this group of countries,&#13;
expenditures on labor market programs are especially low â&#128;&#147; as a rule, not exceeding 0.1&#13;
percent of GDP annually. Respectively, relatively few jobseekers benefit from the passive&#13;
and active programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    24&#13;
&amp;#12;Protected categories of workers from contract termination. Many of the jobless are&#13;
especially vulnerable in the labor market. They may have no qualifications and/or a low&#13;
level of education. They may have multiple employment barriers, including cognitive and&#13;
health-related barriers, and difficult home lives (e.g., lack of transportation, many children,&#13;
childcare problems, domestic violence). Their placement in a job is not only a challenge to&#13;
the jobseekers themselves but to the employment agency as well. The employability of&#13;
population groups at risk might be a more serious problem for PES if policies to restrict an&#13;
inflow of jobseekers had not already been embedded in the labor laws (for data on some of&#13;
the vulnerable categories of the registered unemployed in ECA countries, see Annex I, Table&#13;
AI.4).&#13;
&#13;
In order to protect certain groups of workers still employed from falling into unemployment&#13;
and to provide some relief to PES, in many countries, the labor laws stipulate restricted&#13;
rights to terminate the employment of specially protected workers. In the Moldovan Labor&#13;
Code, the list of protected employees includes 12 categories of individuals; in the Latvian&#13;
Labor Law, 10 categories; and in the Ukrainian Labor Code, 9 categories (Kuddo 2009b).&#13;
&#13;
A common group of protected categories of workers is a pregnant employee, a female&#13;
employee on maternity leave, a female or male employee on parental leave, a single female&#13;
or male employee caring for a child younger than three years of age, or an employee who&#13;
personally cares for a close relative with severe disability (Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania,&#13;
Slovakia). Older workers (within two to five years from pension entitlement depending on&#13;
the country) are protected by an added burden on the employer to justify the dismissal: a&#13;
particularly warranted reason has to be the grounds of such dismissals.&#13;
&#13;
One of the ramifications of these restrictions is that during an economic downturn,&#13;
employers, especially in SMEs, may have no other choice than to keep the protected&#13;
individuals on the job and perhaps let some of the best professionals go. These priority rules&#13;
for dismissals, on the one hand, may conflict with the economic needs of the company; on&#13;
the other hand, they may avoid or postpone contract termination of the most vulnerable&#13;
groups of workers â&#128;&#147; potentially long-term clients of the PES.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              25&#13;
&amp;#12;Incentives for early registration at the PES. Labor legislation may stipulate provisions aimed&#13;
at stimulating early registration of workers made redundant and seeking a job at PES. In&#13;
particular, in most CIS states, the duration of severance pay is conditional on finding a new&#13;
job and/or registration at the employment service within a certain period of time, typically&#13;
within 10 days after contract termination.&#13;
&#13;
For example, in Russia, severance pay equals an average monthly wage. His or her average&#13;
monthly wages are preserved for the period of taking up a job but not more than for two to&#13;
three months from the date of dismissal (considering also a dismissal allowance) on the&#13;
basis of the decision made by the employment agency. However, the employee should have&#13;
applied to the employment agency within two weeks after dismissal and was not placed in&#13;
a job.&#13;
&#13;
In Kyrgyzstan, severance pay is normally not less than two monthly wages but can be&#13;
extended for the period of up to three months if he or she is still looking for another job and&#13;
has registered at the state employment service within 10 days of contract termination.&#13;
&#13;
Rapid registration with PES allows the jobseeker/laid-off worker to be immediately offered&#13;
available vacancies, provided employment services, such as job counseling and jobsearch&#13;
assistance, or sent him/her to participate in ALMPs, thus shortening the transition from one&#13;
job to another.&#13;
&#13;
Employers in many countries are also requested to inform employment services about&#13;
upcoming collective redundancies. Following the EU Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July&#13;
1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective&#13;
redundancies, in all EU15 countries, companies must inform the responsible state labor&#13;
institutions before notifying employees of dismissal. In several EU15 countries, the relevant&#13;
authorities should not only be notified but also consulted (Austria, Finland, Ireland, the&#13;
Netherlands and Portugal).&#13;
&#13;
In addition, in Latvia, the Labor Law stipulates that in case of a reduction in the number of&#13;
employees an employer must notify the State Employment Agency not later than one&#13;
month in advance regarding the number and occupations of the employees to be dismissed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              26&#13;
&amp;#12;In Armenia, in case of liquidation of the organization or reduction in the number of the&#13;
employees, while terminating the employment contracts the employer must submit the&#13;
information about the number of the dismissed employees to the State Employment&#13;
Service not later than three months in advance. The criterion for collective dismissals to be&#13;
reported is that two months notice must be given by the employer when envisaging the&#13;
dismissal of more than ten percent of the total number of employees, provided it is not less&#13;
than ten employees. These policy measures allow the PES to rapidly intervene and mitigate&#13;
the impact of redundancies early on.&#13;
&#13;
Criteria for being registered as unemployed or jobseeker. In the employment statistics, the&#13;
definition of unemployed is straightforward. For example, based on the definition&#13;
recommended by the International Labor Organization (ILO), Eurostat defines unemployed&#13;
persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Are without work&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Are available to start work within the next two weeks&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks.&#13;
&#13;
There are two other categories of jobless persons not considered as unemployed but as&#13;
inactive according to the ILO definitions, who under certain circumstances might enter the&#13;
labor market. First, persons seeking work but not immediately available consists mostly of&#13;
people who do not qualify as unemployed because of their limited availability to start in a&#13;
new job, despite their being jobseekers. Second, persons available to work but not seeking&#13;
employment consists of persons wanting to work and available to do so, but who are not&#13;
recorded as unemployed because they are not actively looking for a job. This includes,&#13;
among others, discouraged jobseekers and persons prevented from seeking work by&#13;
personal or family circumstances. For their part, individuals in the potential additional labor&#13;
force have a lower attachment to the labor market than the unemployed but higher than&#13;
other economically inactive persons (Eurostat 2011; Table 6). PES in many countries have&#13;
some employment services available for these categories of population as well.&#13;

&#13;
In the employment promotion legislation, and in practice, the legal definitions and criteria&#13;
of unemployed individuals are much more nuanced and are used for early profiling&#13;
(categorization) of the unemployed; for filtering out certain categories of the jobseekers&#13;
who may have other motives for registration and are actually not looking for a job; or for&#13;
setting up incentives for their early registration as jobseekers following, for example,&#13;
redundancy dismissal â&#128;&#147; in order to speed up their placement in jobs.&#13;
&#13;
In the reviewed countries, the law often makes a distinction between the status of the&#13;
unemployed and the status of the jobseeker. The latter may have access to a limited&#13;
number of employment services, measures, and supports. The unemployed person who is&#13;
eligible to qualify for the full package of benefits, employment services, and ALMPs typically&#13;
should be of working age (which differs country by country); have a sufficient&#13;
unemployment insurance record; and should not be a student at a daily school or retiree.&#13;
Individuals with the status of jobseeker may include first-time jobseekers/new entrants;&#13;
persons without the insurance record, among others. In Azerbaijan and Ukraine, first-time&#13;
jobseekers cannot receive the status of the unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
There are exceptions in the registration criteria. In Croatia, an exception is made for one&#13;
group of retirees: in order to get the status of unemployed, the person should not receive a&#13;
pension, except for a pension beneficiary who acquires entitlement to a disability pension&#13;
resulting from professional work disability.&#13;
&#13;
PES can also register other categories of individuals looking for a job and give them the&#13;
status of jobseekers, such as employed persons who wish to change jobs or part-timers&#13;
looking for full-time jobs; students who wish to work in their free time; or retired persons&#13;
looking for extra income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 28&#13;
&amp;#12;In some countries, as discussed below, the employees who have been given a notice of&#13;
dismissal can also register at PES as jobseekers or even qualify as unemployed. These&#13;
jobseekers have limited access to employment services and ALMPs but also have fewer&#13;
obligations towards the PES as well.&#13;
&#13;
Registration of potentially laid-off workers as jobseekers during the notice period and&#13;
support for jobseeking activities. A proactive approach taken by PES, in the event of&#13;
restructuring and mass redundancies, entails providing assistance to companies and&#13;
employees before employees are made redundant. PES may utilize long-term relationships&#13;
with employers/enterprises and offer advice, information, training, and/or counseling to&#13;
employees facing redundancies.&#13;
&#13;
Advance notice is a means to give workers ample warning of future layoffs and thus&#13;
facilitate jobsearch. The ILO Termination of Employment Recommendation No. 166&#13;
suggests that the worker should, for the purpose of seeking other employment, be entitled&#13;
to a reasonable amount of time off without loss of pay, taken at times that are convenient&#13;
to both parties. This is the practice in many countries.&#13;
&#13;
For example, in Poland, within a minimum two week period of notice, the worker has the&#13;
right to take two to three days leave from work for the purpose of seeking new&#13;
employment, depending on the duration of the notice period. In Lithuania, this length of&#13;
time should not be less than 10 percent of the employeeâ&#128;&#153;s rate of working time during the&#13;
term of notice. Time off from work is granted in accordance with the procedure agreed&#13;
between the employee and the employer (Kuddo 2009b).&#13;
&#13;
In several countries, the employment legislation allows the registration of workers, as&#13;
jobseekers, who were given a dismissal notice. In addition to job counseling and job&#13;
referrals, they are entitled to participate in some ALMPs, such as training. In the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic, as of the dismissal notice in connection with the liquidation, reorganization,&#13;
closure, and downsizing of state employees, redundant workers are entitled to apply to PES&#13;
for the purpose of training, retraining, or upgrading skills. In Lithuania, local PES may&#13;
register the employees who have been given a dismissal notice as jobseekers. An early start&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                              29&#13;
&amp;#12;to looking for a job may give to these workers an advantage in the labor market in finding&#13;
alternative job offers.&#13;
&#13;
Preferential groups. Some of unemployed jobseekers require minimal assistance from PES&#13;
and use its computerized self-help services, while other more vulnerable clients need in-&#13;
depth help from PES staff. Consequently, a personal service model involves the&#13;
individualization and segmentation of PES services and interventions.&#13;
&#13;
In some countries, legislation defines vulnerable groups of jobseekers who may receive&#13;
preference in job referrals and gaining access to ALMPs. In Slovakia, as an example, a&#13;
disadvantaged jobseeker is a person who is: (i) younger than 25 years of age, who continued&#13;
training full-time less than two years ago and obtained first regular paid employment; (ii)&#13;
older than 50 years of age; (iii) registered as a jobseeker for at least 12 months of the&#13;
previous 16 months (the long-term unemployed); and (iv) disabled. The list of priority&#13;
groups of jobseekers in selected countries is presented in Table 7.&#13;

Given the limited number of registered vacancies and low access to/coverage with ALMPs,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;regular jobseekersâ&#128;? may have no chance to compete with these preferential groups.&#13;
Employers, in turn, are looking for new recruits based on economic criteria, first of all,&#13;
based on the skills and qualifications of jobseekers. Having such restrictions put in place,&#13;
they may be looking for new recruitments elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
Waiting period. Some countries have established a waiting period after which the jobseeker&#13;
can be attributed the status of unemployed and start receiving unemployment benefits.&#13;
During this period, the jobseeker is offered, if available, a suitable vacancy from the vacancy&#13;
databank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                31&#13;
&amp;#12;In Azerbaijan, the PES may decide upon the status of the unemployed if a person who is&#13;
registered as a jobseeker is not offered work within 10 days from the date of registration at&#13;
PES. In Uzbekistan, unemployed persons are not recognized as unemployed if they twice&#13;
declined a suitable job within 10 days from the date of registration at PES, or if they did not&#13;
appear at the local PES, without good reason, within 10 days from the date of registration in&#13;
order to find a suitable job. In Russia, the status is conferred by PES if it cannot provide&#13;
suitable employment for jobseekers within 10 days from the date of their registration. These&#13;
restrictions are used to immediately offer the jobseeker available job vacancies and/or to&#13;
test the real unemployment status of jobseekers.&#13;
&#13;
Other restrictions for registration. In many countries, owning land and subsequent income-&#13;
earning activities, such as agricultural work or agro-business/farming, are considered to be&#13;
an equivalent of a permanent job or as employment. Farmers cannot therefore be&#13;
registered as unemployed or claim unemployment benefits. For example, in Azerbaijan,&#13;
according to the Law on Employment, individuals who own agricultural land are considered&#13;
to be employed and are not eligible to be classified as unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
Performing agriculture activities also is considered as a restriction to registering as&#13;
unemployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, ownership of a registered company&#13;
may cause similar restrictions if the personâ&#128;&#153;s revenues exceed, on a monthly basis, 25 percent&#13;
of the average wage. Similar restrictions are stipulated in the employment legislation in&#13;
Croatia. As a result of such restrictions, a significant portion of low income individuals,&#13;
especially living in rural areas, are deprived of access to employment services.&#13;
&#13;
Availability for employment and actively seeking employment. Availability for&#13;
employment and active jobsearch are two of the key requirements to be considered&#13;
unemployed. Employment legislation in the reviewed countries is quite vague with respect&#13;
to the definition of availability and active jobsearch. However, in the employment&#13;
promotion legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we found the following criteria regarding&#13;
actively seeking employment: the jobseeker (i) contacts PES regularly; (ii) submits&#13;
applications to employers or publishes announcements and applies for vacancies and&#13;
tenders; and (iii) acts in compliance with the professional orientation, training, and re-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              32&#13;
&amp;#12;training programs. In several countries, relevant conditionalities are regulated in the&#13;
individual employment action plans or are decided at the discretion of employment officers.&#13;
&#13;
In Slovenia, an unemployed person is deemed available for employment if he/she is at the&#13;
disposal of the Employment Service every working day for three hours at the permanent&#13;
address or at the address agreed upon with the Employment Service. The time of being at&#13;
the Employment Service disposal is set by the latter. An unemployed person has the right to&#13;
be absent for personal or other valid reasons up to 18 working days per year. An&#13;
unemployed person is deemed to be at the disposal also during the time of carrying out&#13;
appropriate or suitable temporary or casual work or jobseeking in accordance with the&#13;
referral or in agreement with the Employment Service (MISSOC 2011).&#13;
&#13;
In practice, the definition of active search includes individuals with different jobsearch&#13;
intensities. Some individuals search for jobs only by registering in PES. Other â&#128;&#156;semi-&#13;
passiveâ&#128;? seekers place an ad and/or check for jobs with family/friends, while â&#128;&#156;more activeâ&#128;?&#13;
seekers undertake several activities to seek employment. As an example, by the LFS data, in&#13;
FYR Macedonia, 82 percent of the unemployed register at the Employment Service Agency&#13;
(ESA) but only one third of the unemployed relied on being registered in the employment&#13;
office as the only job-seeking mechanism, while 49 percent of the registered unemployed&#13;
used other means. If we look at the most active jobsearch instruments, such as those&#13;
individuals who placed an ad, answered an ad, contacted employers, and/or participated in&#13;
job interviews, only 53 percent of the survey-based unemployed used such jobseeking&#13;
mechanisms (Angel-Urdinola and Macias 2008).&#13;
&#13;
1.3. Employment Services Available to Jobseekers, Employers, and Inactive Population&#13;
&#13;
Services to Unemployed Jobseekers. Labor market services (client services) component of&#13;
ALMPs provided by the PES encompasses the following groups of activities: (i) information&#13;
services for jobseekers providing ad hoc information on and referrals to opportunities for&#13;
work, training, and other forms of assistance, together with job brokerage services for&#13;
employers; and (ii) individual case-management services of individualized assistance (e.g.,&#13;
intensive counseling and guidance, jobsearch assistance, personalized action plans) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            33&#13;
&amp;#12;follow-up for unemployed persons provided as part of a planned path towards durable&#13;
(re-)employment (EC/Eurostat 2006).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
These basic employment services can enhance job matching and reduce the waiting times&#13;
for job-seekers to find work and for employers to fill vacancies. The key determinants of&#13;
positive employment impacts of basic employment services are listed in Box 1. However,&#13;
most of the countries in the sample provide only some of the employment services from the&#13;
menu listed. Country examples will be discussed below.&#13;

&amp;#12; Box 1: Lessons from Impact Evaluations on Keys to Effective Employment Services Program&#13;
&#13;
 Evaluations conclude that the key determinants of positive employment impacts of basic&#13;
 employment services include:&#13;
     â&#128;¢   â&#128;&#156;Work first strategyâ&#128;? extended over the whole organization of the public employment&#13;
         service&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Close dialogue and cooperation with the community and especially with employers&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Investment in staff skills, prioritizing the field positions&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Performance management system, with clear targets, performance indicators, and&#13;
         processes for monitoring of performances&#13;
     â&#128;¢   High-quality, up-to-date information and knowledge about the labor market conditions,&#13;
         including labor demand (a web based job vacancy databank of the highest quality being the&#13;
         core instrument)&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Pronounced client focus and client adjustment approach throughout all activities&#13;
     â&#128;¢   High-quality ICT support for all PES activities and functions, especially for client information&#13;
         and services&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Good infrastructure for provision of labor market information to employers and jobseekers&#13;
         and for communication between those two groups of clients&#13;
     â&#128;¢   A pro-active and systematic approach to following up on the registered job vacancies and&#13;
         the registered unemployed at the PES centers.&#13;

&#13;
Individual action plans. As part of activation policies, PES in many countries provide each&#13;
registered unemployed person with an â&#128;&#156;individual action planâ&#128;? identifying the activities&#13;
required by and responsibilities of the jobseeker to reach an employment target. An&#13;
individual action plan is a document negotiated between the unemployed person and a PES&#13;
officer, signed by the unemployed person, describing actions to be undertaken by both&#13;
parties, after which the actions described in the plan become obligatory. The plan implies&#13;
the assessment of an individualâ&#128;&#153;s employability and sets up particular steps for jobseekers in&#13;
their efforts to look for vacancies. This allows PES staff to monitor, and if necessary, revise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    36&#13;
&amp;#12;the plan. It is part of the policy that PESâ&#128;&#153; relationship with jobseekers be increasingly based&#13;
on the strong self-activity and self-responsibility of the jobseeker. 6&#13;
&#13;
Individual action plans are a particularly useful tool for those jobseekers who have multiple&#13;
barriers to employment, such as a lack of skills, a lack of prior labor market experience, and&#13;
social needs. Especially for young jobseekers, an individual action plan at some point in the&#13;
unemployment spell may be required. Jobseekers who are not actively seeking jobs&#13;
according to their individual plan might face benefit sanctions or might be even excluded&#13;
from the PES roster of unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
Examples of setting up individual action plans are found in Table 8. In a number of countries&#13;
(Bulgaria, Poland, Macedonia, Serbia, Slovakia), individual action plans are offered to all&#13;
unemployed persons within a certain period of initial registration; in others, it is offered on&#13;
a voluntary basis, for instance, in Hungary (except for school leavers, for whom it is&#13;
compulsory) and the Czech Republic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
 As emphasized in the European Employment Guideline No 19, PES should adopt a preventive and proactive&#13;
approach to the support of the unemployed including early identification of needs, jobsearch assistance,&#13;
guidance, and training as part of personalized action plans.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Table 8:        Schedule of Setting Up Individual Action Plans and Coverage in Selected&#13;
                Countries&#13;
 Bulgaria             An action plan and a schedule of visits shall be prepared for each registered&#13;
                      unemployed person.&#13;
 Czech Republic       PES is obliged to offer jobseekers under the age of 25 and university graduates&#13;
                      the opportunity to develop a plan.&#13;
 Estonia              The first part of the Individual Action Plan shall be prepared, in cooperation&#13;
                      between the unemployed person and the Estonian Unemployment Insurance&#13;
                      Fund, within seven days of registration of the person as unemployed. The&#13;
                      second part of the Individual Action Plan shall be prepared within 18 weeks&#13;
                      after registration of a person as unemployed. If an unemployed person belongs&#13;
                      to a risk group and due to that, his or her engagement in employment is&#13;
                      difficult, the second part of the Individual Action Plan shall be prepared&#13;
                      promptly but not later than five weeks after registration of the person as&#13;
                      unemployed.&#13;
 Slovakia             PES is obliged to offer an Individual Development Action Plan no later than four&#13;
                      calendar months after the entry into force of the decision to classify the citizen&#13;
                      by registration as jobseekers. For disadvantaged jobseekers, who are registered&#13;
                      as jobseekers over 24 months, PES is obliged to offer an Individual Action Plan&#13;
                      no later than four calendar months from the expiry of 24 months. For&#13;
                      disadvantaged jobseekers, who asked in writing for an Individual Action Plan,&#13;
                      PES is obliged to start preparing the plan within 30 calendar days of the written&#13;
                      request.&#13;
 Croatia              An individual action plan shall be prepared within 90 days from the day of&#13;
                      registration of the unemployed person with the Employment Service.&#13;
 Montenegro           An individual action plan shall be prepared within two months from the date of&#13;
                      registration of unemployed persons.&#13;
 Serbia               The individual employment plan is to be established, as a rule, no later than 90&#13;
                      days after registration by PES and the unemployed.&#13;

As far as the content of the individual action plan is concerned, the Employment Law in&#13;
Estonia, for instance, stipulates that the first part of the Individual Action Plan is to be filled&#13;
in within seven days of registration of the person as unemployed and it should set out the&#13;
following:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢     Name and personal identification code or date of birth of the unemployed person&#13;
    â&#128;¢     Name and position of the person who prepared the plan&#13;
    â&#128;¢     Description of the professional and working skills of the unemployed person, and of&#13;
          his or her other skills which facilitate employment&#13;
    â&#128;¢     Activities necessary for finding work, persons required to perform such activities,&#13;
          and the schedule to perform the activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    38&#13;
&amp;#12;   â&#128;¢   Frequency of visits to the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund or the frequency&#13;
       of contacting PES by phone. During each visit or phone call, the date of the next visit&#13;
       or phone call will be entered in the Individual Action Plan&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Labor market services necessary for employment&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Reporting by the unemployed person on compliance with the Individual Action Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The second part of the Individual Action Plan to be filled in within 18 weeks after&#13;
registration of a person as unemployed contains:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Analysis of professional and working skills of the unemployed person, and of his or&#13;
       her other skills which facilitate employment&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Description of the circumstances that hinder the employment of the unemployed&#13;
       person&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Labor market services, including the services that are needed to eliminate or&#13;
       mitigate the circumstances hindering employment, and other measures that the&#13;
       person is required to take and the schedule for taking the measures.&#13;
&#13;
Individual action plans are known to be highly labor intensive. Some employment services&#13;
may lack office capacity to establish such plans and follow up on their implementation in&#13;
accordance with official PES guidelines. In particular, high caseloads may limit frequent&#13;
reporting and confirmation of unemployment status by jobseekers, as well as opportunities&#13;
for job counselors to monitor the implementation of the action plan by the jobseeker.&#13;
&#13;
Suitable employment. In many countries, the registered jobseekers-to-vacancy ratio is very&#13;
high. As noted above, vacancies registered at PES tend to be largely for unskilled or&#13;
semiskilled workers with low wages, in public sector jobs, or jobs with harmful working&#13;
conditions; and they often go unfilled. Not surprisingly, even in an environment of high&#13;
unemployment, there are still vacancies that are not attractive enough to be filled by the&#13;
jobseekers of different qualification levels, previous earnings, or age and sex.&#13;
&#13;
In this situation, the legal definition of suitable employment becomes acute. â&#128;&#156;Suitable&#13;
workâ&#128;? means work that a registered jobseeker/unemployed cannot refuse a job offer&#13;
without risking a benefit sanction or of being deleted from the roster of unemployed.&#13;

&amp;#12;â&#128;&#156;Suitable jobâ&#128;? criteria not only determine the nature of PES referrals to vacancies but can&#13;
also be used to assess clientsâ&#128;&#153; availability for work, in the sense that persons who appear&#13;
unwilling to take up a job offer for particular reasons may be considered as not available for&#13;
work and therefore be sanctioned (OECD 2000).&#13;
&#13;
The concept of suitable employment is discussed in the ILO Employment Promotion and&#13;
Protection against Unemployment Convention No. 168, 1988. In particular, Article 21 of the&#13;
Convention states that â&#128;&#156;the benefit to which a protected person would have been entitled in&#13;
the case of full unemployment may be refused, withdrawn, suspended or reduced, to the&#13;
extent prescribed, when the person concerned refuses to accept suitable employmentâ&#128;¦ In&#13;
assessing the suitability of employment, account will be taken, in particular, under&#13;
prescribed conditions and to an appropriate extent, of the age of unemployed persons,&#13;
their length of service in their former occupation, their acquired experience, the length of&#13;
their period of unemployment, the labor market situation, the impact of the employment in&#13;
question on their personal and family situation, and whether the position is vacant as a&#13;
direct result of a stoppage of work due to an ongoing labor dispute.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Over time, the concept of suitable employment has become more restrictive in many&#13;
countries. In particular, in its recent report the ILO Committee of Experts observes that, â&#128;&#156;in&#13;
the last decade the move towards the active labor market policies was accompanied by the&#13;
introduction into the legislation of several countries regulating unemployment insurance of&#13;
the rule, according to which unemployment benefit shall not be paid to persons who&#13;
without adequate reasons refuse to take up â&#128;&#152;reasonable employmentâ&#128;&#153; offered to them. The&#13;
overall purpose of the changes has been to â&#128;&#152;motivateâ&#128;&#153; the unemployed into having the&#13;
necessary will and readiness to match, at any time, the requirements of the labor market.&#13;
This â&#128;&#152;motivationâ&#128;&#153; was achieved, inter alia, by replacing the previously applicable rule by&#13;
which a person could be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for having&#13;
refused â&#128;&#152;suitable employment,â&#128;&#153; by the more restrictive concept of withdrawing the benefit&#13;
for refusing employment offered â&#128;&#152;without reasonable grounds.â&#128;&#153;â&#128;? (ILO 2011).&#13;
&#13;
This shift is largely explained by the mismatch between professional skills, qualifications,&#13;
and acquired experience of the registered jobseekers, on the one hand, and actual state of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             40&#13;
&amp;#12;the labor market, on the other, including by the number and the structure of job vacancies&#13;
registered at PES by employers.&#13;
&#13;
Employment promotion legislation in the reviewed countries stipulates different criteria for&#13;
determining suitable work. In particular, the following specifications may apply (Table 9):&#13;
&#13;
Working conditions and type of work. In most of the reviewed countries, any paid work&#13;
conforming to the requirements of labor laws, including shift work, is generally considered&#13;
suitable. Depending on the category of jobseekers, many countries consider casual or&#13;
temporary work or even public works to be suitable.&#13;
&#13;
Categories of jobseekers. In some countries, different criteria of a suitable job are applied&#13;
to different categories of jobseekers. First-time jobseekers and the long-term unemployed&#13;
are asked to accept any job or face sanctions, such as being deleted from the list of&#13;
registered unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
In particular, in the Czech Republic and Estonia, the long-term unemployed may have to&#13;
accept jobs which do not correspond to their education, profession, or previous work&#13;
experience.&#13;
&#13;
In Azerbaijan, any paid work, conforming to the requirements of labor laws, including&#13;
temporary work, requiring or not requiring pre-employment preparation, and taking into&#13;
account age and other personal characteristics, is considered as suitable work for the&#13;
following persons: (i) first-time jobseekers, persons who have not worked more than three&#13;
years, and persons with no profession (specialty); (ii) persons failing to upgrade their&#13;
professional skills or initiate training in a related profession or study a new profession; and&#13;
(iii) persons registered at PES over 18 months.&#13;
&#13;
In Russia, any work including of temporary nature and public works is considered suitable&#13;
for the following categories of jobseekers: (i) first-time jobseekers; (ii) non-professionals&#13;
(without specialty); (iii) persons seeking to resume work after a long (more than one year)&#13;
break; or (iv) persons dismissed more than once within one year prior to the beginning of&#13;
unemployment for violation of labor discipline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              41&#13;
&amp;#12;In typical cases, work involving up to two hours per day of travel-to-work time is considered&#13;
suitable in Kyrgyzstan and Latvia, and up to three hours in Slovenia (exceptions are made&#13;
for jobseekers with a child up to 15 years old). Several countries cite no specific figure,&#13;
leaving it at the discretion of PES. For example, in Belarus, the maximum distance of&#13;
suitable employment from the residence of the unemployed is determined by the local&#13;
executive and administrative bodies, taking into account the transport accessibility of the&#13;
new job.&#13;
&#13;
Occupational protection. In Azerbaijan, initially suitable employment offered to the newly&#13;
registered jobseeker should correspond to the jobseekerâ&#128;&#153;s previous profession but after six&#13;
months, suitable employment is also considered to require a shift in profession. In Serbia,&#13;
the job offers by PES could be in the acquired level and type of education within the first 12&#13;
months of registering with PES. After that period the jobseeker should accept job offers of a&#13;
lower qualification level as suitable employment. In Slovenia, a position one level lower may&#13;
be offered to an unemployed person after three months of the registered unemployment as&#13;
a suitable job, and two levels lower position after six months of registered unemployment.&#13;
&#13;
Wage protection. Legislation in several countries mentions particular salary levels as the&#13;
criterion for job suitability. In Belarus, the proposed salary may be not more than 10&#13;
percent below the previous average earnings. In Kyrgyzstan and Moldova, the job is&#13;
considered suitable if at least official minimum wages are guaranteed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Table 9:      Definition of a Suitable Job in Employment Promotion Legislation in Selected&#13;
              Countries&#13;
 Kyrgyzstan       Suitable work is a job that a person is able to perform, according to gender,&#13;
                  education, training, work experience, health status, a short distance from their&#13;
                  place of residence (not more than one hour), and guaranteed wages not lower&#13;
                  than the statutory minimum wage levels.&#13;
 Moldova          Suitable work is a job corresponding to professional training, seniority,&#13;
                  experience, health status, acceptable distance from place of residence, and&#13;
                  guaranteeing a monthly salary of not less than the official legal minimum wage.&#13;
 Czech Republic   Suitable job: the working hours must be at least 80 percent of the stipulated&#13;
                  weekly working hours, and the employment must be agreed for an indefinite&#13;
                  period, or for a fixed term exceeding three months, and correspond to the&#13;
                  jobseeker's state of health (confirmed by the relevant medical assessment&#13;
                  opinions).&#13;
                  Other aspects (e.g., qualifications, length of previous employment, etc.) are&#13;
                  taken into consideration but are not considered to be essential. In practice, this&#13;
                  means that if PES cannot offer a jobseeker a job according to her/his&#13;
                  qualifications, it may offer her/him another job, which does not meet that&#13;
                  qualification. If the jobseeker is registered with PES for more than one year,&#13;
                  the job offered by PES does not have to fulfil all the above-mentioned&#13;
                  requirements.&#13;
 Estonia          Work suitable for an unemployed person during the first 20 weeks after&#13;
                  registration as unemployed is deemed to be employment:&#13;
                  Which is not contradicted due to health reasons;&#13;
                  In the case of which the travel from the place of residence to the place of work&#13;
                  of the unemployed person by public transport will not take longer than two&#13;
                  hours a day and will not cost more than 15 percent of the person's monthly&#13;
                  wages;&#13;
                  Which corresponds to the education, profession, and previous work experience&#13;
                  of the unemployed person;&#13;
                  For which a salary offered is at least 60 percent of the personâ&#128;&#153;s average&#13;
                  monthly income subject to social tax but not less than two times the minimum&#13;
                  wage. In calculating a person's average income of one month subject to social&#13;
                  tax, incomes of the first three months out of the six months before registration&#13;
                  of the person as unemployed shall be taken into account.&#13;
                  Work suitable for an unemployed person as of the 21 week after registration as&#13;
                  unemployed is deemed to be employment:&#13;
                  Which is not contradicted due to health reasons;&#13;
                  Which may be temporary;&#13;
                  In the case of which the travel from the place of residence to the place of work&#13;
                  by public transport will not take longer than two hours a day and will not cost&#13;
                  more than 15 percent of the person's monthly wages;&#13;
                  For which a salary, upon full-time employment, is higher than the&#13;

             but not lower than the minimum monthly wage is offered;&#13;
             Which need not correspond to the education, profession, or earlier work&#13;
             experience of the unemployed person.&#13;
Latvia       Appropriate employment is an employment, which conforms to:&#13;
             The occupational preparedness of the unemployed person and his or her&#13;
             previous occupational activities, as well as the official language fluency level;&#13;
             The state of health of the unemployed person;&#13;
             Accessibility of the offered workplace (a place travelling to by means of public&#13;
             transport from the declared place of residence of the unemployed person shall&#13;
             take not more than one hour in one direction); and&#13;
             Average remuneration in an appropriate occupation in a particular sector (on&#13;
             the basis of the latest official data published by the Central Statistics Bureau),&#13;
             which is offered to the unemployed person.&#13;
Slovenia     Employment shall be deemed suitable if the one-way distance between an&#13;
             unemployed person's place of residence and his/her workplace does not&#13;
             exceed an hour and a half by public transport or transport provided by the&#13;
             employer, or the unemployed person is provided accommodation in another&#13;
             place.&#13;
             Suitable distance between the place of residence and the workplace for an&#13;
             unemployed person who lives alone in a common household with a child up to&#13;

             are no other unemployed persons for whom such a post would be appropriate&#13;
             employment.&#13;
Azerbaijan   Paid work, conforming to the requirements of labor laws, including temporary&#13;
             work, requiring or not requiring pre-employment preparation, taking into&#13;
             account age and other personal characteristics, shall be considered as suitable&#13;
             work for the following persons:&#13;
             First-time jobseekers, persons who have not worked more than three years,&#13;
             and persons with no profession (specialty);&#13;
             Persons failing to upgrade their professional skills or take-up training in a&#13;
             related profession or study in a new profession by the end of the statutory&#13;
             period of payment of unemployment benefits;&#13;

&amp;#12;             If PES is unable to provide suitable employment in a profession within six&#13;
             months, then suitable employment is considered to require a shift in&#13;
             professions, taking into account skills, health status, and professional expertise,&#13;
             availability of training, and vacancies in the labor market.&#13;
             For citizens who do not have a profession or those who held jobs that do not&#13;
             require special training and who are registered as unemployed for more than&#13;
             nine months, and for citizens who wish to resume employment after a long&#13;
             break (more than 12 months), except for citizens of pre-retirement age,&#13;
             suitable employment is also considered participation in paid public works.&#13;
Uzbekistan   For first-time jobseekers who do not have a profession (specialty), suitable&#13;
             work is considered a job that does not require pre-employment training, and in&#13;
             failing to provide it, other paid work, including work of a temporary nature,&#13;
             given the personâ&#128;&#153;s age and other characteristics.&#13;
             After an initial period of unemployment, in failing to provide a job in the&#13;
             personâ&#128;&#153;s own profession (specialty), a job that requires a change in profession&#13;
             (specialty) can be considered suitable work, taking into account the personâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
             abilities, past experience, and resources available to learn a new profession.&#13;
Russia       Paid employment, including work of a temporary nature and public works,&#13;
             requiring or not requiring (according to age and other personal characteristics)&#13;
             preconditions that meet the requirements of labor laws and other normative&#13;
             legal acts is considered suitable for:&#13;
             First-time jobseekers and non-professionals (persons without specialty),&#13;
             seeking to resume work after a long (more than one year) break, dismissed&#13;
             more than once within one year prior to the beginning of unemployment in&#13;
             violation of labor discipline or other actions, ceased to be self-employed, as&#13;
             well as those sent by PES for training and expelled;&#13;
             Refused to increase qualifications (re-qualify) in a profession (specialty) in&#13;
             order to obtain a related profession, or refused to be retrained after the first&#13;
             period of unemployment benefits; and&#13;
             Registered with PES for more than 18 months and have not worked for more&#13;
             than three years.&#13;
Serbia       Within the first 12 months of registering with PES, suitable employment means&#13;
             employment in the acquired levels and types of education.&#13;
             After the first 12 months, suitable employment means employment in jobs at a&#13;
             lower level in the same or related fields of education, taking into account work&#13;
             experience and the state of the labor market.&#13;
Belarus      Work is suitable if the proposed salary is not more than 10 percent below the&#13;
             average earnings calculated over the last two calendar months at the last place&#13;
             of employment (service).&#13;
             After six months of being registered as unemployed, in failing to provide the&#13;
             unemployed employment in to his/her profession (specialty), employment can&#13;
             be considered suitable, if it requires changes in profession (specialty), taking&#13;
             into account the abilities of the unemployed, state of health, work experience&#13;
             in former profession (specialty), and available means of training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                     Suitable employment is any paid work, including the work of a temporary&#13;
                     nature (except for paid public works), corresponding to the requirements of&#13;
                     labor legislation, taking into account age and other characteristics, for the&#13;
                     following categories of the unemployed:&#13;
                     First-time jobseekers and persons without a profession (specialty); persons&#13;
                     seeking to resume work after a long break (more than one year); or persons&#13;
                     who terminated the employment contract for an indefinite period on his/her&#13;
                     own will.&#13;
                     The unemployed cannot be offered the same place of work (training) in the&#13;
                     same profession (specialty) twice.&#13;
                     The maximum distance of suitable employment from the residence of the&#13;
                     unemployed is determined by the local executive and administrative bodies,&#13;
                     taking into account the transport accessibility of the new job.&#13;

&#13;
In some countries, the jobseekers have an obligation to undergo a medical examination to&#13;
determine their suitability for particular jobs. In the Czech Republic, labor offices may&#13;
request an assessment to be made by a designated health institution of the health of a&#13;
person for employment purposes. A jobseeker must undergo this examination. The labor&#13;
office can, at its own expense, examine the state of health of a jobseeker who, for example,&#13;
requests vocational rehabilitation or who gives various health reasons preventing her/him&#13;
from taking up a particular job (MISSOC 2009).&#13;
&#13;
As noted in the OECD study on activation policies, a strict jobsearch requirement does&#13;
â&#128;&#156;make work payâ&#128;? by bringing the unemployed into contact with adequate jobs more&#13;
frequently, but a strict suitable work requirement forces the unemployed to accept lower-&#13;
paid jobs (OECD 2007).&#13;
&#13;
In sum, despite a large number of services available to jobseekers, the majority in the&#13;
reviewed countries rely solely on personal and family connections as the main way to find&#13;
suitable employers, and many job placements occur without an intermediation role by PES.&#13;
&#13;
Services and incentives for employers. The review of employment promotion legislation in&#13;
selected countries identified the following incentives for employers to register at PES and&#13;
obtain access to services and benefits (for more detail the rights and obligations of the&#13;
employers in selected countries, see Annex II, Table A2.1):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   â&#128;¢   Provision of tax breaks for hiring vulnerable groups in excess of established job&#13;
       quotas&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Provision of preferential credits to employers and unemployed individuals on a&#13;
       return basis&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Contribution to employers for transport costs of his/her workers to work and back&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Posting and managing vacancies&#13;

&#13;
In order to participate in labor market programs, employers have to register at PES, and&#13;
there are different practices. Employers might be obliged to register in connection with&#13;
vacancies that they have to report to PES, or they might be interested in certain services&#13;
and entitlements. Country examples follow.&#13;

&amp;#12;In Slovenia, there are no formal procedures or requirements for employers to register with&#13;
PES. However, for efficient work-flow as supported by IT, PES maintains a registry&#13;
(database) of employers, which update automatically from the Business Register. Employers&#13;
also have to register their job vacancies with the employment service, and can use its&#13;
services, among others and most heavily, related to:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Job-mediation&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Involvement in employment programs (training, public works, or wage subsidies)&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Managing the layoff procedures of a large number of redundant workers&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Managing the procedures in the case of planned layoffs of disabled workers&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Issuing work permits for foreigner workers outside the EU.&#13;
&#13;
In Malta, there are also no formal procedures for registration. However, employers&#13;
interested in browsing through the CVs of jobseekers on the PES website must register in&#13;
advance with PES to protect the personal data of jobseekers.&#13;
&#13;
In Poland, the regulations that specify the tasks of public employment services impose an&#13;
obligation on labor offices to provide help to employers in selecting candidates for a job.&#13;
Help to employers in recruiting workers through employment agency services and career&#13;
guidance and information is the key task of the labor offices. Employers are also obliged to&#13;
register a job offer at the labor office when they apply for a work permit for an alien â&#128;&#147; a&#13;
third-country national.&#13;
&#13;
In many countries, employers have to notify to the PES of all of their vacancies. According to&#13;
the WAPES survey, among 70 public employment services worldwide, 7 only one third have&#13;
legislation stipulating that employers must register any vacancy arising within their&#13;
establishment to PES. For example, in Romania, all employers are obliged to notify the&#13;
territorial employment agencies of any available vacancies within five days.&#13;
&#13;
Employers, in addition to the incentives, have certain obligations to PES. The review of&#13;
employment promotion legislation identified the following employer obligations:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Inform the PES about&#13;
&#13;
7   WAPES express survey, May 2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               48&#13;
&amp;#12;         â&#136;&#146; vacant positions&#13;
         â&#136;&#146; needs for training and their own capacity to organize such training&#13;
         â&#136;&#146; vacancies announced which were occupied or closed&#13;
         â&#136;&#146; persons employed who have been referred by the Employment Agency&#13;
         â&#136;&#146; unemployed persons who refused to accept the proposed suitable jobs&#13;
         â&#136;&#146; unemployed personsâ&#128;&#153; refusal to employ the persons seeking jobs who have&#13;
             been referred to by the PES&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Employ jobseekers within the limits of established job quotas&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Create jobs for the employment of disabled workers&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Hire graduates of public institutions providing vocational, specialized secondary and&#13;
       higher education.&#13;
&#13;
However, too many obligations associated with hiring from the pool of registered&#13;
jobseekers may scare away some of the employers from PES.&#13;
&#13;
As noted in the recent World Bank study, effective employment services rely on tight links&#13;
between the local offices and the local employers. Various methods can be used to achieve&#13;
this including extensive outreach by local office staff, job fairs, aggressive marketing&#13;
campaigns, and regular labor demand surveys (World Bank 2010).&#13;
&#13;
Services to inactive population. The inactive can be defined as persons who are not&#13;
regarded as part of the workforce and who are normally on passive benefit schemes (e.g.,&#13;
disability pension, sickness allowance, early retirement schemes, and unconditional social&#13;
assistance) with no or few obligations to look for work (EC 2009).&#13;
&#13;
The primary target groups for PES in most countries are those who are registered as&#13;
unemployed or who are currently employed but at risk of involuntary job loss due to&#13;
difficult economic circumstances for their employer. However, labor market policies are&#13;
increasingly focused not only on these groups but on a wider range of people who face&#13;
disadvantages and barriers that may prevent them from joining or rejoining the labor force,&#13;
for example, women re-entering work after a family break, young people looking for their&#13;
first job, older workers, and disabled workers. Many want to work and would be ready to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             49&#13;
&amp;#12;start working, but for various reasons they are not actively looking for a job or are not&#13;
available for work on short notice. Relevant incentives should be put in place to attract a&#13;
portion of the currently inactive jobseekers to register at PES and benefit from employment&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
In most cases, the inactive may only receive information from PES about the labor market&#13;
and job vacancies/skills needs. Also, in some countries, referrals to free (publicly funded)&#13;
external training and education, and coaching for employability skills might be provided.&#13;
The list of services for the inactive population in selected countries follows. 8&#13;
&#13;
In Poland, any person not registered as unemployed or as a jobseeker may use the so-called&#13;
open job offers (i.e., those which indicate the employer). Such offers are displayed on a&#13;
notice board in local labor offices, in the press or on the website of the office, during job&#13;
fairs or exchanges, etc. Non-registered persons also have the right to obtain exhaustive&#13;
information on the services of the labor office and possibly the rights to which he/she is&#13;
entitled, including the right to obtain information on the conditions and rules of&#13;
registration.&#13;
&#13;
In the Czech Republic, the EURES information and counseling service also offers its facilities&#13;
at no charge to clients who are not registered. This service has been introduced at all 77&#13;
labor Offices in the Czech Republic. EURES CR has 15 EURES counselors who were trained&#13;
for their counseling and informational duties in special courses organized by the European&#13;
Commission and the Czech Republicâ&#128;&#153;s Employment Service Administration.&#13;
&#13;
In Latvia, non-registered clients can access only the database of vacancies on the PES&#13;
webpage. In Hungary, non-registered clients also have a legal right to claim help and&#13;
services in the local labor offices, but service is based on â&#128;&#156;remainingâ&#128;? PES capacities.&#13;
&#13;
In Austria, unregistered persons may use the â&#128;&#156;ejob room,â&#128;? which is a self-service job&#13;
placement internet platform. In Sweden, unregistered clients have free access to the self-&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;service system on the internet as well as telephone services provided by&#13;
ArbetsfÃ¶rmedlingen.&#13;
&#13;
In Malta, unregistered jobseekers can make use of job matching services offered at PES job&#13;
centers and training services offered at the training centers. Unregistered jobseekers can&#13;
input their CV into the PES database.&#13;
&#13;
In the United Kingdom, customers who are not registered as a jobseekers (for benefits&#13;
purposes) can still apply for jobs through the Jobcentre Plus website or through the&#13;
electronic job kiosks that are available in offices, some libraries, and supermarkets.&#13;
Although non-registered customers are unable to access Jobcentre Plus contracted training&#13;
and support, they may be able to access similar, non-contracted services delivered by their&#13;
local authorities, community groups, and not for profit organizations. In addition, Jobcentre&#13;
Plus delivers a comprehensive range of benefits to inactive customers of working age,&#13;
including benefits for lone parents. It ensures their benefits are accurate and on time; gives&#13;
advice to parents on formal childcare; and, helps them understand the conditions for&#13;
receiving benefits to help fraud and error.&#13;
&#13;
In Europe, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Denmark are the only countries that provide&#13;
active job brokering (pre-selection of suitable candidates from the register for particular&#13;
vacancies) to all inactive people. Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Norway, and Sweden&#13;
provide active job brokering to selected inactive groups (EC 2009).&#13;
&#13;
Yet, inactive people are not a common key focus group of PES. Employment services and&#13;
ALMPs like jobsearch assistance, training, and education programs, or referral to free&#13;
(publicly funded) external support to remove barriers to employment, are only offered to&#13;
inactive persons in a few countries.&#13;
&#13;
Services and incentives for employed jobseekers (jobchangers). Services for employed&#13;
persons are aimed to support occupational and job-to-job mobility (EC 2009). In the&#13;
reviewed countries, jobchangers have access to a limited array of employment services&#13;
although with no obligations to the PES. Only in the Serbian employment promotion&#13;
legislation did we find the notion that a person seeking a change of employment is deleted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              51&#13;
&amp;#12;from the PES registry for failure to contact PES at least once every six months or to respond&#13;
to calls from PES. Mostly, services for jobchangers are limited to the provision of labor&#13;
market information (vacancies/skill needs) and employer-notified vacancy information&#13;
through on-site computer terminals or through the website.&#13;
&#13;
For example, in Bulgaria, employed persons who wish to change jobs (as well as students&#13;
who wished to work in their free time) are entitled to the following services: (i) information&#13;
on the vacant jobs announced; (ii) intermediation for the provision of information and&#13;
employment; and (iii) professional provision of information, consulting, and orientation. In&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina, currently-employed persons may register at PES in order to change&#13;
employment, for the purpose of mediation, counseling, and information free of the obligation&#13;
of regular contact. Jobchangers usually form two to three percent of the pool of jobseekers,&#13;
and clearly are not the priority group for PES.&#13;
&#13;
In sum, various incentives and mandatory requirements can be found in employment&#13;
promotion legislation for jobseekers to actively participate and benefit from employment&#13;
services, be it incentives for early registration at the PES, requirements to attend intensive&#13;
interviews with employment counselors, to apply for job vacancies as directed by&#13;
employment counselors, to independently search for job vacancies and apply for jobs, to&#13;
accept offers of suitable work, or to participate in the formulation of an individual action&#13;
plan.&#13;
&#13;
Employment services are by far the most common and most cost-efficient labor market&#13;
program offered by PES to almost all of the registered jobseekers. Selected services are&#13;
provided to employers and groups of inactive population. The impact of employment&#13;
services on job placements, however, depends on numerous other factors â&#128;&#147; from the&#13;
institutional capacity of PES to monitor the activities of jobseekers and enforce rules and&#13;
regulations to the overall situation in the labor market, including the availability of job&#13;
vacancies.&#13;

&amp;#12;II.           Incentives for Participation in ALMPs&#13;
&#13;
This section provides an overview of incentives for jobseekers, service providers, and employers&#13;
(if any) to participate alternative labor market programs (ALMP) in selected countries, as&#13;
envisaged in their employment promotion legislation. According to the European Commission&#13;
(EC), Eurostat, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the&#13;
labor market policy (LMP) measures to be discussed in this section are classified into six&#13;
detailed categories according to the type of action as follows:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)     Training programs;&#13;
      (ii)    Programs that facilitate the insertion of the unemployed or other target groups into a&#13;
              work placement by substituting hours worked by an existing employee;&#13;
      (iii)   Programs that facilitate the recruitment of the unemployed and other groups, or help to&#13;
              ensure the continued employment of persons at risk of involuntary job loss;&#13;
      (iv)    Programs that aim to promote integration of disabled persons into the labor market&#13;
      (v)     Programs that create additional jobs&#13;
      (vi)    Programs that promote entrepreneurship by encouraging the unemployed and target&#13;
              groups to start their own business or to become self-employed (EC/Eurostat 2006).&#13;
&#13;
ALMPs have two basic objectives: economic, by increasing the probability of the unemployed&#13;
finding jobs, productivity, and earnings; and social, by improving inclusion and participation&#13;
associated with productive employment. These interventions have the potential to significantly&#13;
improve labor market performance if well designed, targeted, and implemented. However, the&#13;
findings of various reviews of ALMPs indicate that the programs are not a panacea for large-&#13;
scale unemployment and that expectations must be realistic. The impact of relevant incentives&#13;
for participation in ALMPs tends to be limited as the fiscal and institutional constraints of PES&#13;
produce low numbers of beneficiaries for particular programs and programs have low efficacy&#13;
in terms of job placements. Also, ALMPs cannot substitute for structural labor market reforms,&#13;
which aim to improve the functioning and efficiency of the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      53&#13;
&amp;#12;2.1. Role of ALMPs&#13;
&#13;
Historical analysis of variations in spending on labor market programs indicates that spending&#13;
on ALMPs does not vary significantly over the business cycle, implying that spending levels per&#13;
unemployed person decline sharply in a deep recession (OECD 2009). However, there are&#13;
exceptions. In 2009, Latvia and Slovenia tripled overall budgetary allocations for ALMPs&#13;
compared to 2008; Armenia, Croatia, and Estonia almost doubled the budget for training; and&#13;
FYR Macedonia significantly increased funding for programs on employment incentives and&#13;
integration of disabled individuals (Kuddo 2010).&#13;
&#13;
Judging from the number of beneficiaries, the most popular labor market programs tend to be&#13;
career counseling, professional orientation and career guidance services (but students also&#13;
benefit from the program), jobsearch assistance, training, and public works. Compared to 2008,&#13;
in 2009 in Latvia, the number of participants in training programs increased from 8,600 to&#13;
29,200 and in Estonia, from 5,800 to 18,100. This reflects a shift in emphasis from a â&#128;&#156;work firstâ&#128;?&#13;
approach to a â&#128;&#156;train first approachâ&#128;? through training and work experience programs.&#13;
Nevertheless, the number of ALMP beneficiaries (other than counseling) remains low in most&#13;
cases (for details of participation in selected countries, see Annex I, Tables AI.5 and AI.6).&#13;
&#13;
Some countries even mandate by law the norms for participation in ALMPs. During the recent&#13;
economic downturn, in Russia, the normative penetration or coverage rate of jobseekers with&#13;
training programs increased from 15.3 to 20 percent of the total number of registered&#13;
unemployed, and with social adaptation courses, from 13 to 20 percent of the total&#13;
unemployed. Overall, the normative coverage rate of the unemployed with ALMPs increased&#13;
from 30 to 45 percent of the total registered unemployed (Kuddo 2010).&#13;
&#13;
The countries have different priorities in the provision of ALMPs. According to the structure of&#13;
budgetary allocations, in 2008, Bulgaria spent 68 percent of expenditure on active measures on&#13;
job creation; the Czech Republic, 66 percent on supported employment and rehabilitation;&#13;
Estonia spent 87 percent of total expenditure on ALMPs on training; Latvia spent 52 percent,&#13;
and Romania 60 percent of expenditure on active measures on employment incentives (Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 54&#13;
&amp;#12;I, Table AI.7). The structure and level of expenditure on ALMPs is determined based on political&#13;
and ethical considerations rather than the results of program evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
ALMPs are known to have two effects on jobsearch activity and job finding rates: a locking-in&#13;
effect and a threat effect. The locking-in effects refer to the period a person participates in a&#13;
program. During this period, jobsearch intensity may lower, because there is less time to search&#13;
for a job, and also because the individual might want to complete, for example, an ongoing skill-&#13;
enhancing activity (Calmfors 1994; Lalive et al. 2001). On the other hand, the threat effect&#13;
distorts the behavior of unemployed individuals prior to enrolling in ALMPs. For some,&#13;
participation in ALMPs might not be very attractive, perhaps because it is stigmatizing and the&#13;
payoffs are clearly not very promising. To avoid participation, the unemployed will increase&#13;
their jobsearch effort and lower their reservation wages, and as a consequence they will leave&#13;
unemployment faster when faced with a threat of program participation than without the&#13;
threat (Rosholm and Svarer 2004). The threat effect might be more prominent when the&#13;
participation in ALMPs is mandatory, which is not the case in most of the reviewed countries.&#13;
&#13;
2.2. Incentives in Provision of Training Programs&#13;
&#13;
Training programs are the most widely used active labor market measure. Labor market&#13;
training is aimed at those who have already left the formal schooling system. Their main&#13;
objective is to increase the employability and productivity of participants. Training can also play&#13;
an important role in combating skills shortages in specific sectors and occupations.&#13;
&#13;
Training programs include measures such as classroom training, on-the-job training, and&#13;
apprenticeships, and provide either general education (e.g., alternative high school&#13;
certification, language skills, or computer skills) or specific vocational skills (firm- or industry-&#13;
specific skills) for unemployed workers outside the education and training system. Some&#13;
programs are designed to develop basic job readiness only.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Training programs do have their limitations. First, they are relatively costly. Second, their&#13;
impact will be limited when job opportunities for trained workers are scarce. Finally, training&#13;
programs are also associated with deadweight losses (i.e., some workers would have found jobs&#13;
without the training). In addition, labor market-related training organized or supported by PES&#13;
cannot substitute for general education and cannot make up for the failings of the educational&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
A number of studies point to the observation that on-the-job training and employer&#13;
involvement seem to be associated with more positive outcomes than classroom training and&#13;
programs that do not have connections to the private sector. This type of training is demand-&#13;
driven: it is based on strict and monitorable financial incentives; it allows combining the&#13;
resources of the state, employers, and jobseekers themselves; and it secures much higher&#13;
placement rates for graduates. Some studies also highlight the value of linking training with&#13;
formal qualifications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  56&#13;
&amp;#12;However, it is difficult to conduct a thorough costâ&#128;&#147;benefit analysis of training programs, as well&#13;
as other ALMPs, because of problems in identifying long-term fiscal return from the programs&#13;
to individuals and the society, and because of possible displacement and substitution effects.&#13;
The impact evaluation studies usually include information on program participant costs,&#13;
temporary income support savings, net impact on reemployment, and average monthly&#13;
earnings. Other crucial information is usually not available: downstream wage impacts and&#13;
returns to society (tax revenues, productivity gains, and long-term income support payments&#13;
required by non-participants). In the reviewed countries, such a survey was recently done in&#13;
Estonia; it found that each Euro invested by PES into the training and retraining programs of&#13;
unemployed individuals returns to the society in a two-year period four Euros (Lauringson et al.&#13;
2011).&#13;
&#13;
Studies from Europe and other OECD countries overwhelmingly find that training programs&#13;
targeting youth are relatively unsuccessful as they undermine their capacity to actively search&#13;
for employment (negative locking-in effects) (Betcherman et al. 2004 and Calmfors 1994).&#13;
Furthermore, retraining programs are of limited applicability for older workers, as well as for&#13;
workers with little formal education.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 6 presents the coverage of registered jobseekers with training programs in countries for&#13;
which data are available. In most countries, the ratio is relatively modest, including less than&#13;
two percent of jobseekers in Albania and Armenia. On the other hand, the ratio of beneficiaries&#13;
to the average annual number of registered jobseekers is very high in Kazakhstan and&#13;
Tajikistan. This is largely explained by the fact that the number of registered unemployed out of&#13;
the total number of unemployed is very small, and many on the roster receive training&#13;
organized by PES. Employers, training providers, and beneficiaries may receive financial and&#13;
other incentives to secure their active involvement and subsequent placement of jobseekers in&#13;
jobs.&#13;
&#13;
Incentives for beneficiaries. A training stipend/allowance is commonly provided to participants&#13;
of training courses organized by PES, typically in the amount of the unemployment benefit or as&#13;
the ratio of the minimum wage or the previous salary of the trainee (for the incentives to&#13;
participate in training programs in some of the reviewed countries, see Annex II, Table A2.3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               57&#13;
&amp;#12;The higher the training stipend is, the stronger the incentives to enter, stay, and successfully&#13;
complete the training course. In many cases, the training stipend is differentiated depending on&#13;
the category of jobseekers. In some countries, child supplements are paid to the trainees.&#13;
Country examples follow.&#13;
&#13;
In Moldova, unemployed persons receiving unemployment benefits and enrolled in training&#13;
courses receive a stipend of 70 percent of the previously established unemployment benefits;&#13;
in Ukraine, the stipend is the amount of the unemployment benefit; in the Kyrgyz Republic and&#13;
Armenia, unemployed persons receive a stipend in the amount owed in unemployment&#13;
benefits, increased by 20 percent.&#13;
&#13;
In some countries the stipend is related to the previous wage of the jobseeker. In Uzbekistan,&#13;
persons who have lost jobs and labor income, and are registered with PES for work, having&#13;
children and other dependents, while in vocational training, retraining, and advanced training&#13;
receive a stipend in an amount not less than 75 percent (without dependents, 50 percent) of&#13;
their average monthly salary in the previous job, but not below the minimum wage set by law,&#13;
and not above the average wage.&#13;
&#13;
In Azerbaijan, the training stipend might reach 70 to 100 percent of the previous wage,&#13;
depending on the category of the trainee. In Russia, for persons dismissed from an organization&#13;
during the 12 months preceding the beginning of the course, and who had at that time paid&#13;
work of at least 26 consecutive weeks of full-day (full-week) or part-time working day (shift)&#13;
and (or) part-time working week equivalent to 26 consecutive weeks of full-time, the stipend&#13;
equals 75 percent of average earnings calculated over the last three months at the last place of&#13;
employment, but not above the maximum value of unemployment benefits and not below the&#13;
minimum value of unemployment benefits.&#13;
&#13;
In some other countries, the stipend is expressed as a ratio of minimum wages. For example, in&#13;
Montenegro, the stipend equals 60 percent of the minimum wage; in Lithuania, the training&#13;
stipend equals 70 to 100 percent of the minimum wage depending on the duration of training.&#13;
In Peru, the monthly financial subsidy to trainees is not less than the minimum wage when&#13;
recipients meet the regular training schedule established by the company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              58&#13;
&amp;#12;First-time jobseekers and the long-term unemployed are usually not entitled to unemployment&#13;
benefits. So their stipend, if any, might be determined by different formula. In Russia, for first-&#13;
time jobseekers, individuals seeking to resume work after a long (more than one year) break, or&#13;
individuals dismissed for violation of labor discipline or other actions, as well as dismissed for&#13;
any reason during the 12 months preceding the beginning of training, and who had at that time&#13;
paid work at least 26 consecutive weeks, the value of the stipend is established by the&#13;
educational institutions, but not below the level of unemployment benefits provided for that&#13;
category of jobseekers. In Armenia, for individuals not eligible to receive the unemployment&#13;
benefit, the stipend is 50 percent of the minimum wages. The stipend in Azerbaijan includes a&#13;
supplement for child support; the size of stipend for persons who have dependent children&#13;
under 18 years of age increases by 10 percent for each child, but with the condition of the&#13;
supplement not exceeding 50 percent of the total stipend.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the stipend, other benefits might exist for trainees. For example, in several&#13;
countries in Eastern Europe, for jobseekers who are provided education and training for the&#13;
labor market, in addition to training stipend/allowance, PES may provide reimbursement for&#13;
food, accommodations, and travel expenses from the place of residence to the education and&#13;
training venue. In Croatia, the trainees are reimbursed for public transportation, mandatory&#13;
textbooks, food, and designated protective clothing, footwear, and other aid devices.&#13;
&#13;
In Peru, the training provider may provide insurance covering sickness and accidents or directly&#13;
assume the cost of these contingencies. In Slovenia, the participants have the right to health&#13;
care if they are not insured on some other basis.&#13;
&#13;
Employment legislation may establish penalties for those not regularly attending the training&#13;
course. For example, in Belarus, the size of the stipend may be reduced by 25 percent for one&#13;
month or a trainee may be deprived of the stipend for the same period due to irregular&#13;
attendance, without good reason, or breach of discipline and internal regulations of the&#13;
educational establishment. In Russia, stipends may be reduced by 25 percent for one month, or&#13;
payment may be suspended for up to one month in the case of absence or irregular attendance&#13;
without good reason.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                59&#13;
&amp;#12;Usually there is a mismatch between the huge demand for training among jobseekers and the&#13;
number of training courses financed by PES. Some countries have established priority rules for&#13;
participation in training. For example, in Russia, the following groups have priority to undergo&#13;
training, retraining, and advanced training: the disabled unemployed, unemployed who have&#13;
surpassed the six-month period of unemployment, jobseekers discharged from military service,&#13;
spouses of military service members, and graduates of educational institutions, as well as first-&#13;
time jobseekers (previously not employed) and non-professionals (without specialty).&#13;
&#13;
Incentives for training providers. Very few public employment services possess their own&#13;
training centers, and the role of PES in providing training is becoming increasingly contractual,&#13;
seeking training services from other public and private sector agencies. This includes training&#13;
that usually is supported through either direct provision (i.e., through public or private training&#13;
institutes) or financial support (i.e., funding training costs and/or subsidizing trainees).&#13;
&#13;
Many countries in the ECA regionâ&#128;&#148;Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia,&#13;
for exampleâ&#128;&#148;purchase training programs from various providers through public tenders, which&#13;
ensures quality and fosters private sector participation. PES typically contract for a selected&#13;
number of training slots or days of training. The training contractor may provide additional&#13;
counseling services. In other countries like Ukraine and Azerbaijan, PES have training centers&#13;
and the private training contractor provides flexible modular training. PES only provide the&#13;
premises and cover operating and other related costs.&#13;
&#13;
In some countries (Bulgaria), in order to improve the outcome of training programs, local&#13;
organizations proposing training programs must show evidence of demand for trained workers&#13;
and agree to a negotiated job placement rate which may be different for institutional training&#13;
and for on-the-job training provided by the employer. Contracts are increasingly performance-&#13;
based (e.g., the payment schedule is adjusted accordingly to meet the employment targets&#13;
after completion of the program). Indeed, experience from Turkey confirms that&#13;
performance-based contracting can be an effective incentive to ensure that training meets the&#13;
needs of the labor market. The analysis suggests that placement rates are 20 points higher&#13;
when providers must meet employment guarantees than when these guarantees do not exist&#13;
(World Bank 2010).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 60&#13;
&amp;#12;Incentives for employers. In employment promotion legislation, various incentives have been&#13;
established for employers in the provision of training services but also in the recruitment of&#13;
trainees after completion of the program. A few country examples follow.&#13;
&#13;
In the Czech Republic, by agreement with PES, retraining may be performed at the employer's&#13;
premises with a view of trainees' further employment. Employers may receive full or partial&#13;
compensation for the related costs. In Belarus, local Departments of Labor, Employment, and&#13;
Social Protection can fully or partially offset the costs to employers for vocational training of&#13;
employees who are going to be dismissed in connection with the liquidation or downsizing of&#13;
the organization or while hiring first-time jobseekers.&#13;
&#13;
In Estonia, employers can receive remuneration for supervising practice in the workplace. For&#13;
each practice hour attended by an unemployed person, the employer receives remuneration&#13;
for supervision in the amount of 100 percent of the minimum hourly wage established during&#13;
the first month, 75 percent of the minimum hourly wage during the second month, and 50&#13;
percent of the minimum hourly wage during the third and fourth months the unemployed&#13;
person participates in work practice.&#13;
&#13;
In Tunisia, the company that hires the trainees receives a recruitment bonus. The premium is&#13;
paid after one year of actual work from the date of recruitment. The private sector receives&#13;
support from the National Employment Fund to pay the employer's contribution to statutory&#13;
social security for trainees who are recruited as jobseekers and contracted as higher education&#13;
graduates for seven years â&#128;&#147; from 100 percent of the contribution during the first and second&#13;
year to 25 percent during the seventh year.&#13;
&#13;
Despite various incentives for beneficiaries, service providers, and employers, the impact of&#13;
training programs on job placement tends to be low, partially due to the limited availability of&#13;
training programs.&#13;
&#13;
2.3. Incentives Associated with Wage Subsidies&#13;
&#13;
Interventions to directly create jobs are controversial since they can have significant costs and&#13;
uncertain benefits, especially beyond the short term. In the EU 27, there was an average of just&#13;
over 822,000 persons benefitting from direct job creation measures at any point during 2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                61&#13;
&amp;#12;That represents 7.1 percent of the 11.5 million persons participating in all types of LMP&#13;
measures. The average cost of direct job creation measures across the EU is over â&#130;¬ 10,000 per&#13;
person-year, which is more than double the cost for all types of LMP measures (Eurostat 2009).&#13;
&#13;
A large-scale direct job creation program is justified at times of economic downturn, when&#13;
aggregate demand is depressed and vacancies are few (EC 2006). Direct job creation programs&#13;
are sometimes intended to increase demand in the economy or to provide work experience&#13;
with a view to improving employability or to achieve both of these objectives. They include&#13;
wage subsidies, assistance to self-employed businesses, public sector work programs, and work&#13;
trials. As is the case of training programs, the role of PES may simply involve referring&#13;
participants to measures, or it may extend to organizing and sponsoring programs.&#13;
&#13;
One of the main direct job creation measures are wage subsidies, for instance, subsidies to&#13;
encourage employers to hire new workers or to keep employees who might otherwise have&#13;
been laid-off for business reasons. Financial incentives are either provided directly (through&#13;
direct wage subsidies) or indirectly (through social security waivers and reductions in labor&#13;
taxes).&#13;
&#13;
Wage subsidy programs can be scaled up relatively rapidly, making them particularly prominent&#13;
during times of economic crises to temporarily sustain jobs and avoid layoffs. These programs&#13;
typically are targeted at the long-term unemployed, areas/sectors with high unemployment,&#13;
and special groups of workers (e.g., youth) to integrate them into real workplaces (ideally with&#13;
some training) and, thus, providing a point of entrance into the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
While these programs serve a social objective, it is difficult to design subsidies that actually&#13;
meet the goal of creating jobs in a cost-effective manner. They are often associated with&#13;
deadweight losses. They also can have unintended effects such as subsidized workers replacing&#13;
unsubsidized ones (â&#128;&#156;substitutionâ&#128;? effect) or employers hiring subsidized workers and laying&#13;
them off once the subsidy period ends. Another issue is that how to safeguard against&#13;
displacement that is, how to ensure that the employer would not have filled the new work&#13;
place in any event.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               62&#13;
&amp;#12;Wage subsidies are costly labor market interventions and subsequently attract limited&#13;
participation. In the countries for which the data are available, in 2009, the highest ratio of&#13;
recipients of wage subsidies compared to the average annual pool of registered jobseekers was&#13;
8 percent in Slovenia, followed by Hungary and Lithuania at 7 percent (Annex I, Table A.1.6;&#13;
Kuddo 2010).&#13;
&#13;
Employment promotion legislation in many countries highlights the priority list of potential&#13;
beneficiaries. In Lithuania, the priority list includes 13 categories of jobseekers, including the&#13;
disabled, first-time jobseekers, the long-term unemployed, persons over 50 years of age who&#13;
are capable of work, pregnant women, etc. In Estonia, a wage subsidy may be paid for the&#13;
employment of unemployed persons who have been released from prison, the long-term&#13;
unemployed, and unemployed person 16â&#128;&#147;24 years of age who have been registered as&#13;
unemployed for more than six consecutive months and have not found work during that time.&#13;
&#13;
There are limits in the size of the wage subsidy. For example, in Mongolia, an employer who&#13;
hires unemployed persons who have not had a job for more than one year and are registered at&#13;
PES, with sustainable employment for more than six months, receives a wage subsidy from the&#13;
Employment Promotion Fund in the amount equal to 60 percent of the total wage paid to that&#13;
employee during first six months of his/her employment. In Estonia, the wage subsidy is 50&#13;
percent of the wage or salary of the employee or public servant but not more than the&#13;
minimum monthly wage. In Lithuania, the wage subsidy may not exceed the minimum monthly&#13;
wage. The most generous wage subsidy was found in Ukraine: wage subsidy (grant) may be&#13;
paid to employers in the amount of his/her expenditures on wages but not above the average&#13;
wage in the related field in the national economy.&#13;
&#13;
There might be time limits for the payment of the subsidy. In Lithuania, where fixed-term&#13;
employment contracts of are agreed with the employed persons, the period of payment of the&#13;
subsidy may not be longer than three months.&#13;
&#13;
Legislation might foresee the penalties for employers for early termination of the contract with&#13;
subsidized workers. In Estonia, an employer must return a wage subsidy in full if the relevant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               63&#13;
&amp;#12;employment or service relationship is terminated at the initiative of the employer earlier than&#13;
one year after entry into the contract of employment or appointment to the position.&#13;
&#13;
2.4. Incentives for Public Works&#13;
&#13;
Public works programs (also known as workfare programs) have been widely implemented both&#13;
as safety net interventions and ALMPs. Countries have introduced public works with diverse&#13;
objectives, such as to protect from large covariate shocks (e.g., natural disasters, economic&#13;
downturn, or seasonal labor demand shortfalls), protect households from temporary job losses,&#13;
fight against poverty, or help the poor gain temporary employment.&#13;
&#13;
Public works programs provide direct and temporary employment opportunities at low-wage&#13;
rate. These jobs comprise labor intensive infrastructure projects (e.g., road construction and&#13;
maintenance, irrigation infrastructure, and soil conservation), as well as community activities&#13;
and civic projects. Normally, they serve as a short-term bridge between more permanent jobs,&#13;
especially in environments where jobs are few.&#13;
&#13;
Public works for the unemployed can be combined with vocational training or non-formal&#13;
education when an unemployed person does not have the qualifications, professional&#13;
knowledge, or skills required or when such training is required for employment. For example, in&#13;
Slovenia, a participant in public works may take part in training and education programs during&#13;
no more than one fourth of their working hours, with full-time weekly working hours&#13;
amounting to 30 hours.&#13;
&#13;
Public works programs have proven to be an effective measure for creating short-term&#13;
employment for truly jobless workers if they are carefully targeted and if the wage is set below&#13;
the equilibrium wage for unskilled labor (for a stock-taking of these programs and their&#13;
impacts, see Subbarao 2003; Betcherman et al. 2004; Ravallion 2008; Del Ninno, Subbarao, and&#13;
Milazzo 2009).&#13;
&#13;
Public works are also not a common program provided by PES. For example, around half of the&#13;
ECA countries provide public works. In 2009, the highest ratio of participants to the average&#13;
annual number of registered jobseekers was 41 percent in Kyrgyzstan, followed by 35 percent&#13;
in Ukraine, 23 percent in Latvia, and 15 percent in Tajikistan (Kuddo 2010; Annex Table A1.6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              64&#13;
&amp;#12;However, workers on administrative leave, often unpaid, and other categories, such as&#13;
individuals on social assistance, might also participate in public works organized by PES.&#13;
&#13;
In some countries, certain categories of jobseekers may have a preferential right to participate&#13;
in public works. In Azerbaijan and the Kyrgyz Republic, non-recipients of unemployment&#13;
benefits have priority. In Russia, unemployed citizens who have been registered at PES for over&#13;
six months have also preferential rights for participation.&#13;
&#13;
The level of wages is critical in securing participation in public works. In Estonia, the minimum&#13;
hourly wage payable for public work is the official minimum hourly wage. In other countries,&#13;
the minimum wages are so low that other benchmarks should be used, be it average wages or&#13;
unemployment benefits. In Moldova, unemployed persons participating in community service&#13;
(public works) receive the monthly benefit in the amount of 20 percent of the average wage in&#13;
the economy over the previous year. In the Kyrgyz Republic, individuals engaged in paid public&#13;
works receive remuneration for actual work performed, but not less than 50 percent of the&#13;
unemployment benefits and not more than four times the basic unemployment benefit. The&#13;
required amount is paid through the organizers of the public works.&#13;
&#13;
In Uzbekistan, as additional incentives in carrying out public works, persons are guaranteed an&#13;
amount for the work done, but not lower than the unemployment benefit, increased by 15&#13;
percent. The time in these jobs counts towards job tenure for pensions and allowances for&#13;
temporary disability.&#13;
&#13;
Other expenditures may be covered for employers and beneficiaries. In Lithuania, the&#13;
employers/organizers of public works may receive compensation for the following expenses:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Wage compensation for the time actually worked by the employee in public works,&#13;
       calculated according to the minimum hourly pay&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Compensation for compulsory state social insurance contributions;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Monetary compensation for unused leave.&#13;
&#13;
Employer compensation is paid by the local PES (50 percent) and the municipality (50 percent).&#13;
&#13;
A local PES compensates the following expenses for persons carrying out public works:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                65&#13;
&amp;#12;   â&#128;¢   For those who are traveling from the place of residence to work using long-distance&#13;
       and/or local (suburban) transport, the traveling expenses to and from their workplace&#13;
       according to tariff rates for traveling by bus or railway carriage&#13;
   â&#128;¢   All the expenses related to the compulsory medical examination and vaccination against&#13;
       contagious diseases, provided this is stipulated in legal acts regulating safety and health&#13;
       at work.&#13;
&#13;
Beneficiaries of public works might have other entitlements. In Slovenia, while employed in the&#13;
program, the participants are entitled to annual leave with a duration of no less than four&#13;
weeks; a meal allowance is provided; and social security contributions are paid for them. In&#13;
Russia and in Azerbaijan, while participating in public works, the unemployed retain the right to&#13;
receive unemployment benefits.&#13;
&#13;
Funding of public works might have multiple sources. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the&#13;
funding for the implementation of the public works programs is provided by PES and the public&#13;
works contracting authority; it may also be provided by the public works provider. In&#13;
developing countries, donor and NGO funding plays a key role.&#13;
&#13;
2.5. Incentives for Self-employment and Entrepreneurship&#13;
&#13;
Support for self-employment is usually an effective measure, helping the unemployed with the&#13;
entrepreneurial skills (which is admittedly a relatively narrow group) necessary to start their&#13;
own business and escape unemployment. Based on international experience, the strategy has&#13;
been successfully used by only a small portion of the unemployed, given that such programs&#13;
usually reach a higher-skilled segment of the unemployed (Betcherman et al. 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Public employment services in very few of the reviewed countries provide entrepreneurship&#13;
grants. In 2009, the highest ratio of grant recipients compared to the average annual number of&#13;
registered jobseekers occurred in Russia, 11 percent, followed by Slovenia, 7 percent, and the&#13;
Czech Republic, 4 percent (Annex I, Tables A1.5 and A1.6; Kuddo 2010). As far as micro credits&#13;
are concerned, it is more efficient to deliver them through specialized financial institutions&#13;
since it is outside the purview of PES. Among the reviewed countries, Serbia recently conducted&#13;
a impact evaluation of self-employment subsidies; the program is run by the local National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                66&#13;
&amp;#12;Employment Service (NES) office and provides a subsidy of 130,000 dinars (approx. US$2,400).&#13;
Applicants submit a business plan to the NES branch office, and applicants with the highest&#13;
number of points, by a specially designed scoring formula, receive the subsidy (Bozanic et al.&#13;
2011). Economic activity rates among applicants approved and not approved for the subsidy&#13;
differ significantly (Table 10).&#13;

&#13;
Self-employment promotion ranges from measures that entail financial and advisory assistance&#13;
for starting up small businesses to micro credit programs that function as a poverty alleviation&#13;
strategy. These measures are often conditional on a successful review of a business plan and&#13;
include direct financial assistance for business start-up, support in accessing venture capital,&#13;
training in entrepreneurial skills, and mentoring. They have been offered either on a universal&#13;
basis or to particular groups, such as the newly unemployed or the long-term unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
Program conditions vary. Participants may receive assistance to set up their businesses as a lump-&#13;
sum payment or periodic allowance, often supported by technical services such as training,&#13;
counseling, and assistance in developing and implementing a business plan. â&#128;&#156;Screeningâ&#128;? is&#13;
commonplace, whereby potential beneficiaries undergo an assessment to evaluate their&#13;
likelihood of success. In a number of OECD countries, attendance at an information or&#13;
orientation seminar is mandatory before obtaining an application to participate in the relevant&#13;
programs. Other countries conduct interviews. Some countries use pre-entry business advisory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  67&#13;
&amp;#12;services or counseling to improve the applicantâ&#128;&#153;s entrepreneurial skills and the quality of the&#13;
business plan.&#13;
&#13;
In the reviewed countries, various incentives have been established in the employment&#13;
promotion legislation to attract participation in self-employment programs. Support for self-&#13;
employment usually starts with the provision of basic information. In Lithuania, local PES&#13;
provides information about the conditions for starting up a business, the employment of&#13;
employees, and the opportunities for pursuing activities under a business certificate. They also&#13;
organize basic business training for jobseekers pursuing self-employment.&#13;
&#13;
Since self-employment programs are not an entitlement program, the target population must&#13;
be screened to restrict the number served and to maximize the economic returns to the&#13;
resources used. Most countries having such programs rely on self-screening mechanisms,&#13;
including applications, use of pre-entry business advisory services and training, and&#13;
development of business plans. In addition, the countries usually rely on the private sector to&#13;
deliver self-employment programs, while the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s role is limited to program financing.&#13;
&#13;
Priority is given to certain categories of jobseekers. In Estonia, jobseekers who have completed&#13;
business training or who have vocational or higher education in economics or experience in&#13;
business receive preferential treatment in receiving a business start-up subsidy. In Lithuania,&#13;
social considerations are also taken into account; the disabled who are starting a business&#13;
receive support covering at least 35 percent of the expenses related to the creation&#13;
(adaptation) of workplaces.&#13;
&#13;
Assistance and financial support might be given for business advisory services and training. In&#13;
Bulgaria, persons who have received a loan under the Micro Credits Guarantee Fund project are&#13;
entitled to use the training services to acquire professional qualifications. They also may be&#13;
reimbursed for costs incurred for hired advisory services.&#13;
&#13;
In Bulgaria, unemployed persons, who are entitled to financial compensation and who wish to&#13;
start an economic activity for production of goods and/or rendering of services, are provided,&#13;
on account of the Unemployment Fund, with lump-sum amounts after approval of his/her&#13;
business plan by PES.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               68&#13;
&amp;#12;In the Czech Republic, PES may provide a financing to a person who is self-employed and who&#13;
has ceased to be a jobseeker. A bridging contribution is provided for, at most, three months in a&#13;
monthly amount equal to half the minimum subsistence.&#13;
&#13;
In some countries, unemployment benefits serve as the source of funding for seed capital. In&#13;
particular, in Croatia, Serbia, and Ukraine, a cash compensation (unemployment benefit) for the&#13;
whole period of eligibility may be paid in a one-time (lump-sum) amount to launch self-&#13;
employment at the request of the unemployed. In Mongolia, the Employment Promotion Fund&#13;
may deliver small loans, conditional on being repaid, for purposes of purchasing raw materials,&#13;
tools, or other required investments to the self-employed or persons running a business in the&#13;
form of a partnership or cooperative.&#13;
&#13;
Certain employment legislation might foresee penalties for early termination of the PES-&#13;
supported economic activity. In Serbia, a contract is signed governing the mutual rights and&#13;
obligations of PES and the unemployed person who becomes self-employed, and includes&#13;
penalties for termination of the contract. In Slovakia, a person who has ceased to operate or&#13;
carry out self-employment within two years of receiving PES funding is required to repay a&#13;
proportion of the contribution attributable to the respective period of time.&#13;
&#13;
The already functioning employers might receive targeted support in order to create jobs for&#13;
jobseekers selected from the PES roster, be it through targeted funds or tax concessions. In the&#13;
Czech Republic, contribution towards recruitment costs can be paid to an investor who, within&#13;
two years, creates at least 10 jobs in economically depressed areas. The investor may receive&#13;
financial support from the state for creating these jobs and also for retraining and training&#13;
employees. The support amounts to CZK 200,000 per job. The amount of support for retraining&#13;
and training is a maximum of CZK 30,000 per job.&#13;
&#13;
In Bulgaria, employers and small enterprises may be provided with the funds for 12 months,&#13;
with respect to the first five jobs opened, if an unemployed persons who was referred by PES is&#13;
hired. The amount of support equals the minimum wage for each new worker.&#13;
&#13;
In Ukraine, businesses, agencies, and organizations that create additional jobs for vulnerable&#13;
categories of jobseekers (e.g., individuals who need social protection and are not able to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               69&#13;
&amp;#12;compete on equal terms in the labor market or exceed the established employment quotas for&#13;
the disabled) are granted tax exemptions, which partially or fully compensate for the costs&#13;
associated with the hiring of additional employees.&#13;
&#13;
In Lithuania, support for job creation can be provided to employers who create new jobs for or&#13;
adapt already-existing workplaces to the disabled unemployed person and who employ&#13;
unemployed persons from the PES roster under an open-ended employment contract. Support&#13;
for job creation is provided in the amount not to exceed 22-fold the last published national&#13;
average monthly wages for the creation of one workplace. The employers must cover at least&#13;
35 percent of the expenses related to the creation (adaptation) of the workplace and maintain&#13;
the created (adapted) workplace for at least 36 months from the time of employment of&#13;
persons sent by the local PES. In the case that such workplace is liquidated, the employer has to&#13;
repay to the local PES:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Total amount of the subsidy where a workplace is liquidated during the first 12 months&#13;
       from its creation (adaptation)&#13;
   â&#128;¢   80 percent of the subsidy where a workplace is liquidated 12-24 months from its&#13;
       creation (adaptation)&#13;
   â&#128;¢   50 percent of the subsidy where a workplace is liquidated 24-36 months from its&#13;
       creation (adaptation).&#13;
&#13;
In addition to employers, incentives can be provided to jobseekers to encourage their rapid&#13;
return to work. In Serbia, a recipient of unemployment benefits for at least three months, who&#13;
establishes an open-ended working relationship with PES, is entitled to a one-time incentive for&#13;
employment in the amount of 30 percent of the total amount of monetary compensation,&#13;
which would have been paid for the time remaining until the expiration of the right to financial&#13;
compensation.&#13;
&#13;
In Slovakia, employed or self-employed individuals can apply for a commuting allowance. It&#13;
covers monthly travel expenses for commuting from the place of residence of the employee to&#13;
the place of employment, as provided in the employment contract or implementation of self-&#13;
employment. An allowance for commuting can be provided to persons who were registered as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               70&#13;
&amp;#12;jobseekers for at least three months and found a job. Relocation costs are refunded (mobility&#13;
grant) in several ECA countries if the new place of work was referred to and agreed upon by&#13;
PES.&#13;
&#13;
Overall, micro finance institutions might be better positioned to assess, on behalf of PES, the&#13;
feasibility of applicant business plans and deliver micro loans or small grants to unemployed&#13;
individuals who want to start their own business. Moreover, existing evidence on interventions&#13;
aimed at supporting micro and medium enterprises shows high deadweight losses and high&#13;
business mortality (Betcherman et al. 2000).&#13;
&#13;
2.6. Programs for Risk Groups in Labor Market&#13;
&#13;
Special employment programs for risk groups aim to provide assistance in determining&#13;
appropriate fields and employment opportunities. The following categories of jobseekers are&#13;
considered risk groups in the labor market (EC 2009):&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Young and older unemployed persons (ages 16-24 and 50-74)&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Immigrants having problems entering the labor market&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Ex-prisoners who have not reinserted into the workforce&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Women returning to the workforce&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Single parents&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Physically or disabled persons with reduced work capacity or mental health problems&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Unemployed people with alcohol/drugs misuse&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Unemployed people with poor skills levels.&#13;
&#13;
Relative to prime-age workers, youth are especially likely to be more affected by negative&#13;
output shocks as their productivity is generally lower given differences in skills and experience.&#13;
&#13;
The programs for relevant vulnerable groups typically include the provision of the employability&#13;
and training plans, job and career counseling services, various aptitude tests and vocational&#13;
assessment tests, and wage subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
Many countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asiaâ&#128;&#148;Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Czech Republic,&#13;
Poland, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan, for exampleâ&#128;&#148;have established an employment quota&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                71&#13;
&amp;#12;for the disabled, and in some countries, for other categories of workers. Employers have to&#13;
create jobs for and accept the disabled without a probation (trial) period. In the Kyrgyz Republic,&#13;
the Labor Code stipulates that employment quotas for disabled individuals should be not less&#13;
than 5 percent of the employees in firms having at least 20 workers. However, in ECA the&#13;
system has commonly not been strictly enforced and enterprises failing to fulfill the quota&#13;
usually escape the penalty.&#13;
&#13;
Although quotas on the employment of persons with disabilities also are applied by a number&#13;
of high income countries, the level and terms of their application are different. For example,&#13;
the quota level is set at 2 percent in Spain and South Korea, 6 percent in France, and 7 percent&#13;
in Italy. In many cases, failure to comply entails imposition of fines; quotas are regulated&#13;
according to the enterprise profile and the number of employees. For example, although the&#13;
same quota rates are applied in Spain and South Korea, the scale of the respective enterprises&#13;
differ significantly. Thus, while quotas are applied to enterprises with more than 300 employees&#13;
in South Korea, that figure is limited to 50 employees in Spain (OECD 2003).&#13;
&#13;
Turkey has a similar system of employment quotas for disabled individuals but new incentives&#13;
for employers were introduced. The 2008 Employment Package of reforms regulates that the&#13;
hiring quota for people with disabilities for firms with 50 or more employees be maintained (3&#13;
percent of the workforce) but that the Treasury will assume all employerâ&#128;&#153;s social security&#13;
contribution payments within the quota. Also, as an additional incentive, the Treasury assumes&#13;
half of the employerâ&#128;&#153;s social security contributions for people with disabilities hired beyond the&#13;
firmsâ&#128;&#153; quota.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to quotas, governments may consider other strategies for developing efficient&#13;
activation programs for groups with limited work capacity, such as improving their jobsearch&#13;
skills, vocational rehabilitation, subsidies to private employment, sheltered employment, or&#13;
adaptation of the workplace and post-employment counseling. Country examples follow.&#13;
&#13;
In Hungary, businesses with a high ratio of disabled employees might receive special subsidies.&#13;
The labor market integration of people with disabilities is promoted by rehabilitation groups&#13;
available in Rehabilitation Information Centers in 16 county labor centers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                72&#13;
&amp;#12;Estonia has also introduced employment initiatives for people with disabilities. Registered&#13;
disabled individuals are entitled to a personalized jobsearch plan. Measures also include&#13;
support to employers for the adaptation of premises and equipment needed when hiring a&#13;
disabled person, and support from public employment service employees to help the disabled&#13;
at job interviews. In particular, communication support at interviews is provided to disabled&#13;
unemployed persons who, due to their disability, need help in communicating with the&#13;
employer during job interviews.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, a support person could be hired for the disabled persons who, due to their&#13;
disability, need help and direction while working. Alternatively, the Estonian Unemployment&#13;
Insurance Fund covers relevant costs to the employer who ensures a disabled unemployed&#13;
person the service of working with a support person. The service of working with a support&#13;
person may be provided to a disabled unemployed person for a period of up to one year after&#13;
the entry into an employment or service contract between the employer and the disabled&#13;
unemployed person for up to:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Eight hours per day during the first month&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Four hours per day during the second month&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Two hours per day during the third to the twelfth month.&#13;
&#13;
All together, this type of support will be provided for not more than 700 hours per one&#13;
unemployed person during a year.&#13;
&#13;
In Eastern Europe, the most comprehensive package of support to employ disadvantaged&#13;
jobseekers is probably provided in Slovakia. Among the measures, it includes the following:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Contributions to support the employment of the disadvantaged jobseekers who have&#13;
       been registered as jobseekers for at least three months, for a maximum of 24 calendar&#13;
       months. The employer is required to maintain the job created and subsidized by the&#13;
       grant, for the employment of disadvantaged jobseekers at least 24 calendar months.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Contributions to support employment of employees with low wages, reimbursement to&#13;
       the employers and employees of the costs of health insurance and social insurance&#13;
       premiums and contributions to retirement pensions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              73&#13;
&amp;#12;    â&#128;¢   Support to employment of disadvantaged jobseekers in social enterprise in which the&#13;
        share of disabled jobseekers comprises at least 30 percent of the total number of&#13;
        employees.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Support to graduate practice for jobseekers up to 25 years of age, a flat-rate&#13;
        contribution for the amount of the subsistence minimum and reimbursement of the&#13;
        necessary personal expenses associated with the implementation of graduate practice;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Contribution to trigger activity in the form of voluntary service with the aim of&#13;
        jobseekers to obtain practical experience on the job market, an allowance in a lump-&#13;
        sum amount of the subsistence minimum to cover necessary expenses for meals,&#13;
        accommodations, and travel expenses from place of residence or temporary residence&#13;
        to place of voluntary service.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Support to sheltered workshops or protected workplaces for reimbursement of&#13;
        necessary expenses for meals, accommodations, and travel expenses from place of&#13;
        residence to place of the workshop or sheltered employment. 9 An employer who&#13;
        receives a subsidy in order to establish a sheltered workshop must maintain the new&#13;
        jobs for at least three years, or face a penalty.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Contributions to individuals with disabilities to become self-employed: an allowance is&#13;
        provided for disabled individuals registered a as jobseekers for at least three months,&#13;
        and who will be self-employed in a sheltered workshop or sheltered workplace&#13;
        continuously for at least two years.&#13;
&#13;
In many countries, special measures have been established to support the employment of&#13;
youth, older jobseekers, and the long-term unemployed. In Bulgaria, for each new job opened,&#13;
for which an unemployed person up to the age of 29 years with deteriorated work-ability, or a&#13;
young person from a social care facility who has completed his/her education, or an&#13;
unemployed person whose registration has been maintained for at least 12 months, as well as&#13;
unemployed women over the age of 50 and men over the age of 55 who are hired, employers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
  In protected (sheltered) workshops or protected workplaces, at least 50 percent of the workforce should be&#13;
comprised of individuals with disabilities who are unable to find employment in the open labor market, or&#13;
workplaces in which individuals with disabilities train or prepare for work, and where working conditions, including&#13;
requirements for work performance, are adjusted according to the health status of the disabled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        74&#13;
&amp;#12;shall be provided with the amounts equal to minimum wages for the time such person&#13;
remained employed, however, for 12 months at the longest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            75&#13;
&amp;#12;III. Eligibility for Unemployment Benefits, and Incentives for Receiving Benefits and Other&#13;
     Entitlements&#13;
&#13;
This chapter discusses eligibility for unemployment benefits, recipiency rates, types of benefits&#13;
available, and incentives for receiving benefits and other entitlements by the jobseekers in the&#13;
reviewed countries. Two essential functions of unemployment benefits are providing a degree&#13;
of income maintenance during joblessness and facilitating an effective jobsearch.&#13;
Unemployment benefits and early retirement schemes or labor market policy (LMP) support&#13;
are the â&#128;&#156;first line of defenseâ&#128;? for those experiencing a job loss. In the recent economic&#13;
downturn, many countries extended unemployment schemes and/or expanded coverage. In&#13;
addition to unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance benefits, registered&#13;
jobseekers might be eligible for a myriad of other benefits and entitlements many of which,&#13;
such as health insurance or social assistance to the family of a jobseeker, may have much higher&#13;
coverage and value than the unemployment benefits themselves.&#13;
&#13;
Employment promotion legislation in the reviewed ECA countries allows to identify at least 21&#13;
different types of benefits and other entitlements to the unemployed some of which were&#13;
discussed above (Table 11). 10 In most countries, registration with the PES is a requirement to&#13;
receive any of the benefits listed, except social assistance in some countries. 11&#13;
&#13;
Recent experience shows that moderately strict employment protection legislation, when&#13;
combined with a well-designed system of unemployment benefits and a strong emphasis on&#13;
active labor market programs, can help create a dynamic labor market while also providing&#13;
adequate employment security to workers (OECD 2006). Therefore, instead of protecting jobs,&#13;
governments and social partners should consider ways of protecting transitions, as this would&#13;
help make the labor markets more flexible without accepting a loss of income security. Workers&#13;
themselves feel better-protected by a support system in case of unemployment than by&#13;
employment protection legislation (EC 2006; EC 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
     The more detailed eligibility conditions from other countries in the sample were not available to us.&#13;
11&#13;
     Only benefits and other entitlements for the able-bodied population will be discussed here.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 12&#13;

 3.1. Coverage of Jobseekers with Unemployment Protection Schemes&#13;
&#13;
Worldwide, countries do not all have unemployment benefit schemes. According to the Doing&#13;
Business Worker Protection Measure 2012 survey, out of the 176 total economies in the&#13;
sample, 86 have contributory unemployment benefit schemes, and 33 have non-contributory&#13;
arrangements to provide unemployment protection to workers not covered by the general&#13;
provisions (unemployment assistance schemes), all of which have unemployment insurance in&#13;
the first place (Figure 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
     The list of countries with relevant benefits and other entitlements is not exhaustive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            77&#13;
&amp;#12;The presence of unemployment benefit schemes is strongly related to the level of&#13;
development. Out of the 32 screened low income countries, only the Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia,&#13;
Malawi, Nepal, Tajikistan, and Tanzania provide unemployment insurance; Tajikistan has&#13;
unemployment assistance scheme. Among the lower middle income countries, 74 percent do&#13;
not have an unemployment insurance scheme. In contrast, 79 percent of the high income&#13;
countries and 62 percent of the upper middle income countries feature some unemployment&#13;
benefit system.&#13;
&#13;
Regionally, excluding high income OECD countries since they all have contributory&#13;
unemployment benefit schemes, in Eastern Europe, only Georgia and Kosovo do not have&#13;
unemployment benefits. On the other hand, in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 15 percent of the&#13;
countries; in the Middle East and North Africa and in South Asia, 25 percent; in Latin America&#13;
and the Caribbean, 38 percent; and in East Asia and Pacific, 47 percent of the economies have&#13;
unemployment benefit schemes.&#13;

Even if an unemployment protection scheme has been implemented, many of the registered&#13;
unemployed may not be eligible for unemployment benefits. The reason is that the long-term&#13;
unemployed may have precedence over the registered unemployed whose entitlement is&#13;
exhausted or many first-time jobseekers do not have a sufficient insurance record to claim&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 78&#13;
&amp;#12;benefits. In the ECA region in December 2009, only 2 percent of the registered unemployed&#13;
received unemployment benefits in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan; in Moldova, 3 percent received&#13;
benefits; and in FYR Macedonia and Azerbaijan, 7 percent (Annex I, Table AI.4). For the 26 ECA&#13;
countries, the overall average recipiency rate was around 30 percent (Figure 8).&#13;
&#13;
The recipiency rate is much lower in developing countries with relevant benefits schemes. In&#13;
Egypt, for example, during the period 2001-07 on average only 330 people received&#13;
unemployment benefits. The factors contributing to the low utilization are: (i) a lack of public&#13;
awareness about unemployment insurance benefits among plan members; (ii) restrictive&#13;
eligibility conditions; (iii) difficulty (and the stigma attached to) documenting a â&#128;&#156;just-causeâ&#128;?&#13;
firing decision; and (iv) low overall layoff risk among covered open-ended contract employees&#13;
(World Bank 2008).&#13;
&#13;
Across the EU, significantly less than two thirds of those who had been unemployed for at least&#13;
one month during the year actually received unemployment benefits. If other types of benefits&#13;
are taken into consideration, the proportion rises to around 70 percent. There are, however,&#13;
considerable differences between countries. In Belgium, Austria, and Finland, more than 90&#13;
percent of those aged 25â&#128;&#147;59 years who were unemployed for more than six months received&#13;
unemployment benefits (EC 2006).&#13;

Despite the fact that both the fraction of the jobless who receive unemployment benefits (and,&#13;
in some countries, an early retirement benefit for labor market reasons) and the average size of&#13;
the benefit is very small, passive programs comprise a large share of total PES expenditures. For&#13;
example, in 2009 in Croatia, cash payments accounted for 72 percent of total expenditures on&#13;
labor market programs, although beneficiaries comprised only 26 percent of the total number&#13;
of registered unemployed. In Serbia, 88 percent of funds was spent on benefits, yet&#13;
beneficiaries accounted for only 11 percent of the registered unemployed. According to&#13;
available data, only in Belarus is the situation reversedâ&#128;&#148;unemployment beneficiaries consume&#13;
only one fifth of total expenditures on relevant programs (Kuddo 2010).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     80&#13;
&amp;#12;Relatively high unemployment benefits tend to be associated with longer spells in&#13;
unemployment, inter alia, because of the decline in the intensity of jobsearch (EC 2006).&#13;
Financial disincentives may be counterbalanced by an appropriate design of unemployment&#13;
benefits in terms of duration and sanctions and in combination with effective jobsearch&#13;
assistance and activation policies.&#13;
&#13;
3.2. Eligibility Criteria for Unemployment Benefits&#13;
&#13;
Basic principles with respect to unemployment benefits are highlighted in the ILO Employment&#13;
Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention No. 168, 1988. In particular, the&#13;
Convention states that in cases of full unemployment, benefits will be provided in the form of&#13;
periodical payments calculated in such a way as to provide the beneficiary with partial and&#13;
transitional wage replacement and, at the same time, to avoid creating disincentives either to&#13;
work or for employment creation.&#13;
&#13;
In economic literature, most analysis has focused on the entitlement conditions of the&#13;
unemployment benefit (e.g., the level and duration of benefit payments associated with the&#13;
insurance record of contributions) and less attention has been paid to the labor market&#13;
eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Entitlementâ&#128;? conditions restrict benefits to people who either (in the case of fixed-duration&#13;
unemployment insurance (UI) benefits) have a sufficient record of contributions from work or&#13;
an assimilated status and have been unemployed for a limited duration or (in the case of&#13;
assistance-type unemployment benefits) have low total income.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Eligibilityâ&#128;? conditions, on the other hand, restrict unemployment benefits to people who:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Are â&#128;&#156;unemployedâ&#128;? roughly in the sense of the ILO definition of unemployment, that is,&#13;
       not only out of work but also able to enter work at short notice and undertaking active&#13;
       steps to find work&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Meet administrative requirements, such as applying for benefits with the necessary&#13;
       documentation and attending interviews with an employment counselor and applying&#13;
       for vacancies as directed by PES (for a detailed discussion, see Grubb 2000).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  81&#13;
&amp;#12;In order to receive benefits, the applicant has to meet both entitlement and eligibility&#13;
conditions.&#13;
&#13;
3.3. Type of Contract Termination Affecting Benefit Payment&#13;
&#13;
In many countries, entitlement to unemployment benefits is related not only to the insurance&#13;
but depends on the circumstances of the separation from the company. The objective of such&#13;
provisions is, first of all, to limit voluntary termination of the employment contract. For&#13;
example, in Estonia, an insured person does not have the right to receive unemployment&#13;
insurance benefits if the person's last employment or service relationship was terminated: (i) at&#13;
the initiative of the employee or public servant; (ii) due to a breach of duties of employment or&#13;
service, loss of confidence, an indecent act, or an act of corruption; or (iii) by agreement of the&#13;
parties.&#13;
&#13;
The list of restrictive provisions for contract termination is even longer in Slovenia; the right to&#13;
a cash benefit may not be claimed by an insured person whose employment contract was&#13;
terminated due to:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Consensual cancellation&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Extraordinary termination of the employment contract by the employer&#13;
   â&#128;¢   If the worker refused to transfer to and actually carrying out work with the new&#13;
       employer&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Ordinary termination of the employment contract by the worker&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Ordinary termination of the employment contract by the employer because a worker&#13;
       violated a contractual or other obligation arising from the employment relationship&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Termination of the employment contract by the employer because the worker refused&#13;
       the employer's offer for a new employment contract for appropriate work and for an&#13;
       indefinite period&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Extraordinary termination of the employment contract by the employer for reasons&#13;
       having to do with the worker, except in case of extraordinary termination when a&#13;
       worker fails to pass the probationary period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                82&#13;
&amp;#12;However, especially in the emerging market economies and developing countries, formal&#13;
voluntary resignations remain the most common reason for leaving a job. According to the data&#13;
from CIS states, voluntary resignation in which the workers are not entitled to most, if any, of&#13;
the benefits represents a major part of all job separations, three fourths of separations in&#13;
Russia and up to 90 percent in Tajikistan. The share of separations in connection with staff&#13;
reductions is â&#128;&#156;onlyâ&#128;? 2 percent in Belarus and Moldova, 7 percent in Kyrgyzstan, and 11 percent&#13;
in Uzbekistan (Kuddo 2009b).&#13;
&#13;
The term â&#128;&#156;voluntaryâ&#128;? is, nevertheless, misleading. There is a clear correlation between the rates&#13;
and levels of voluntary resignation from sectors and firms, and the level of wages and wage&#13;
growth: the lower the wages, the higher the â&#128;&#156;voluntaryâ&#128;? resignation from jobs. In many cases,&#13;
the firms have no funds for severance payment, thus forcing workers to leave â&#128;&#156;voluntarily.â&#128;? So&#13;
many de facto laid-off workers may lose their entitlement not only to severance pay but to&#13;
unemployment benefits as well.&#13;
&#13;
3.4. Conditions for Receiving and Types of Benefits&#13;
&#13;
Active jobsearch. Typically, unemployment benefits are restricted to those who are available to&#13;
start work at short notice, provide proof of their independent jobsearch (e.g., job applications),&#13;
do not too easily reject job offers on the grounds of wages, working hours, places of work, or&#13;
occupation, and attend interviews and training courses as required by PES.&#13;
&#13;
In Montenegro, while receiving monetary compensation, the unemployed person is obliged to:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Actively seek employment&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Be available for employment&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Accept appropriate employment or work engagement&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Include the appropriate application for the active employment policy; and&#13;
   â&#128;¢   File a monthly report with PES.&#13;
&#13;
In Slovenia, an insured person may exercise the right to a cash benefit if:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   He/she was insured against unemployment prior to the unemployment&#13;
   â&#128;¢   No appropriate employment is available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                83&#13;
&amp;#12;An insured person may retain the right to a cash benefit if:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   He/she is available for employment&#13;
    â&#128;¢   No appropriate employment is available&#13;
    â&#128;¢   After three months of entitlement to a cash benefit no suitable employment is available&#13;
    â&#128;¢   He/she actively seeks employment&#13;
    â&#128;¢   No appropriate active employment policy program is available.&#13;
&#13;
In general, unemployment benefits should be available only to unemployed jobseekers who are&#13;
actively looking for a job. Oftentimes, PES lack the capacity to monitor jobsearch activities by&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
Waiting time for benefit payment. According to the ILO Employment Promotion and Protection&#13;
against Unemployment Convention No. 168, 1988, a waiting period to receive the first payment&#13;
may be established. In particular, Article 18 of the Convention states that:&#13;
&#13;
  i.    If the legislation of a Member provides that the payment of benefit in cases of full&#13;
        unemployment should begin only after the expiry of a waiting period, such period shall&#13;
        not exceed seven days.&#13;
  ii.   Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the length of the waiting&#13;
        period shall not exceed ten days.&#13;
 iii.   In the case of seasonal workers the waiting period specified in paragraph 1 above may&#13;
        be adapted to their occupational circumstances.&#13;
Days of unemployment that generate entitlement to benefits may begin upon layoff from the&#13;
previous job, or they may be counted as from the date of first contact with PES, subject in some&#13;
countries to a waiting period (usually up to one week).&#13;
&#13;
In Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia, monetary compensation is awarded to an&#13;
unemployed person from the first day upon the discontinuation of the labor relation, if he/she&#13;
submits the application for monetary compensation within the given timeframe. In&#13;
Montenegro, cash compensation is also awarded to the unemployed person as of the first day&#13;
of termination of employment if a request to exercise this right has been submitted to PES&#13;
within 30 days of termination of employment. If the unemployed person submits a request&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                84&#13;
&amp;#12;after the deadline, cash compensation is awarded to the beneficiary as of the filing date of the&#13;
request.&#13;
&#13;
In Russia, unemployment benefits accrue to registered jobseekers from the first day of&#13;
recognition as unemployed, and individuals who are dismissed in connection with the&#13;
liquidation of an organization, the downsizing of state employees, or organizations recognized&#13;
as officially unemployed, but not employed in the period which followed the last place of&#13;
employment, the unemployment benefit is calculated from the first day after being made&#13;
redundant.&#13;
&#13;
In new EU member states (EU10), there is no waiting period for benefits in Bulgaria, the Czech&#13;
Republic, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, as well as in Hungary in case of involuntary&#13;
unemployment. In Estonia and Poland, the waiting period is seven calendar days. The&#13;
unemployment insurance benefit is calculated as of the eighth day after submission of an&#13;
application for the unemployment insurance benefit in Ukraine and Moldova.&#13;
&#13;
So depending on the country, the benefits payment may start from the first day after&#13;
termination of the employment contract to the eighth day after submission of an application&#13;
for benefits. In case of voluntary unemployment and summary dismissal, the waiting period&#13;
might be longer: after registration with labor office, two months in Latvia, 90 calendar days in&#13;
Hungary, and six months in Malta (MISSOC 2011).&#13;
&#13;
Some countries have established time limits to register for unemployment benefits. In Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina and in Croatia, an unemployed person acquires the right to monetary&#13;
compensation if he/she registers and submits the application within the timeframe of 30 days&#13;
from the day of termination of the labor relation or the date of de-registering his/her craft or&#13;
activity. Monetary compensation will not be awarded to an unemployed person who submits&#13;
an application after the expiry of the period of time for which the right to monetary&#13;
compensation would have been awarded to him/her. If an unemployed person has submitted&#13;
the application after the expiry of the timeframe, monetary compensation will be awarded to&#13;
him/her from the date of submission of the application up to the expiry of the period for which&#13;
the right to monetary compensation would have been awarded. In South Africa, the application&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              85&#13;
&amp;#12;for unemployment benefits must be submitted, as a rule, within six months of termination of&#13;
the employment contract. This measure also encourages speedy registration of jobseekers so&#13;
that PES can offer them job vacancies, job counseling services, or participation in ALMPs.&#13;
&#13;
Avoiding duplication of benefits. According to the ILO Termination of Employment Convention&#13;
No. 158, 1982, a worker whose employment has been terminated is entitled, in accordance&#13;
with national law and practice, to: (i) a severance allowance or other separation benefits, the&#13;
amount of which shall be based inter alia on length of service and the level of wages, and paid&#13;
directly by the employer or by a fund constituted by employers' contributions; (ii) benefits from&#13;
unemployment insurance or assistance or other forms of social security, such as old age or&#13;
invalidity benefits, under the normal conditions to which such benefits are subject; or (iii) a&#13;
combination of such allowance and benefits. Respectively, the ILO Convention does not require&#13;
both severance pay and unemployment benefits simultaneously. This is reflected in&#13;
employment promotion legislation in several countries.&#13;
&#13;
For example, in Lithuania, unemployed persons, who have been dismissed from work and are&#13;
entitled to severance pay, are granted unemployment insurance benefits not earlier than one&#13;
calendar month after the termination of the employment contract. Also, unemployed persons&#13;
receiving social insurance sickness benefits, occupational rehabilitation, or maternity, paternity,&#13;
or parental benefits granted prior to the registration at the local PES are granted&#13;
unemployment insurance benefits not earlier than upon the expiry of the term of payment of&#13;
these benefits.&#13;
&#13;
Benefit supplements. In some countries, unemployment benefit supplements are granted for&#13;
children and other dependents in the family. In Slovenia, an insured person caring for one or&#13;
more children up to 18 years of age and/or children in regular schooling is entitled to an&#13;
increase of benefits for every child amounting to 10 percent of the full amount of the entitled&#13;
cash benefit.&#13;
&#13;
In Azerbaijan, if the unemployed person has dependent children under 18 years of age, the&#13;
unemployment benefit increases by 10 percent for each child, but with the condition of the&#13;
supplement not exceeding 50 percent of the allowance. In Uzbekistan, for families with children&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                86&#13;
&amp;#12;under the age of 16 years and other dependents, the unemployment benefit for recipients is&#13;
also increased by 10 percent. Although these benefit supplements are small, they, to some&#13;
extent, compensate families with dependents for hardships associated with unemployment.&#13;
&#13;
Extended payment of benefits. Other benefits act as acquired rights that are politically hard to&#13;
remove â&#128;&#147; with no particular objective to â&#128;&#156;activateâ&#128;&#156; jobseekers. In several countries, jobseekers&#13;
at pre-retirement age can maintain their unemployment benefits until they reach pensionable&#13;
age, and their jobsearch requirements are relaxed. However, publicly-subsidized early-&#13;
retirement benefits are largely maintained because other policies to absorb older unemployed&#13;
workers are ineffective.&#13;
&#13;
In Croatia, an unemployed man who has worked 35 years and an unemployed woman who has&#13;
worked 30 years are entitled to financial compensation until he or she finds another job.&#13;
However, at that age it is difficult to find new employment and most older jobseekers will be&#13;
kept on unemployment benefits until they become eligible for retirement benefits.&#13;
&#13;
With similar rules, by the end of 2007, Macedonia had 24,700 individuals receiving&#13;
unemployment benefits, of which 21,300 received the allowance beyond the maximum&#13;
duration of 12 months. This means that only 3,400 persons (less than 1 percent of the&#13;
registered unemployed) received the â&#128;&#156;regularâ&#128;? unemployment benefit. The rest of the&#13;
beneficiary pool is provided an early retirement allowance until they reach retirement age at&#13;
which point they are entitled to an old age pension (World Bank 2008).&#13;
&#13;
In Hungary, unemployed persons may apply for jobseeker aid (unemployment assistance) if&#13;
they: (i) are within five years of reaching retirement age; (ii) have received jobseeker benefits&#13;
for at least 140 days, and the period of payment of benefit comes to an end; (iii) will reach&#13;
retirement age in not more than 5 years or within 3 years after the termination of the jobseeker&#13;
benefits; and (iv) have a sufficient contribution period for retirement (normally 20 years).&#13;
&#13;
Although established based on social considerations, there is a real risk that the early&#13;
retirement scheme will increasingly crowd-out alternative expenditures, such as on ALMPs,&#13;
which have a higher social priority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                87&#13;
&amp;#12;Unemployment assistance. As noted above, 33 countries in the world have, in addition to&#13;
unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance schemes for those who have exhausted&#13;
their entitlement to contribution-based benefits or were not entitled to benefits in the first&#13;
place. Unemployment assistance schemes are especially important for developing countries&#13;
which, as the rule, do not have unemployment insurance systems in place. A few examples&#13;
from the reviewed countries follow.&#13;
&#13;
In Uzbekistan, persons who had previously not worked and first-time jobseekers are entitled to&#13;
receive unemployment assistance benefits if job or training opportunities for which they are&#13;
entitled to a training stipend cannot be provided by PES. The benefit amounts to not less than&#13;
75 percent of the minimum wage set by law. The unemployed person seeking to resume work&#13;
after a long (more than one year) break is also guaranteed payment of unemployment&#13;
assistance benefits in the amount of 75 to 100 percent of the minimum wage depending on the&#13;
category of jobseekers. If 12 months after establishing the status of unemployed, the person is&#13;
not provided a suitable job, he or she has the right to re-receive the unemployment benefit.&#13;
The unemployment benefit is set at a minimum amount of the approved benefit.&#13;
&#13;
In Estonia, the registered unemployed who are not entitled to unemployment insurance&#13;
benefits might receive an unemployment allowance. To receive the allowance they should have&#13;
been employed or engaged in work or an activity equal to work for at least 180 days during the&#13;
12 months prior to registration as unemployed and should have income less than the 31-fold&#13;
daily unemployment allowance rate. Previous employment or engagement in an activity equal&#13;
to work is not required of an unemployed person who, for at least 180 days during the 12&#13;
months prior to registration as unemployed: (i) raised, as a parent or a guardian, a child of up to&#13;
18 years of age with a moderate, severe, or profound disability, a child under 8 years of age, or&#13;
a child 8 years of age until the child completed year one at school; (ii) undergone in-patient&#13;
treatment; (iii) cared for a sick person, a person who is permanently incapacitated for work, or&#13;
an elderly person; or (iv) cared for a disabled person. Unemployment allowance is paid for a&#13;
period of up to 270 days, and the rate is established by the state budget for each budgetary&#13;
year. A recipient of an unemployment allowance not only has the right to benefits but also to&#13;
duties: he or she must appear in person at the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund at an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                88&#13;
&amp;#12;appointed time, comply with the terms and conditions, and perform the activities agreed upon&#13;
in the Individual Action Plan.&#13;
&#13;
One-off financial assistance. In some countries, an unemployed person can receive one-off&#13;
financial assistance to cushion the blow of hardships or to cover the cost of extraordinary&#13;
expenditures. For example, in Russia, unemployed individuals who have lost their right to&#13;
unemployment benefits in connection with an expiration of the payment period, as well as&#13;
individuals in a period of training, retraining, and advanced training at the direction of PES,&#13;
could be provided financial assistance. In Montenegro, an unemployed person who is&#13;
registered with PES and is provided employment outside the place of residence is entitled to&#13;
one-off financial assistance. In Serbia, unemployed youth are also entitled to one-off financial&#13;
assistance to pay for travel and relocation expenses upon new employment.&#13;
&#13;
Extra earnings, and other benefits and entitlements. Some countries allow the unemployed to&#13;
earn extra money. Hungary introduced a new social allowance system in 2006 that increased&#13;
incentives for those receiving benefits to seek work. Benefit recipients are allowed to take&#13;
temporary jobs without losing their entitlement to benefits, including to unemployment&#13;
benefits. In the Czech Republic, since 2004, in order to stimulate attachment to jobs, jobseekers&#13;
have the right to extra earnings even if they draw unemployment support, although earnings&#13;
may not exceed half the minimum wage and work should not take up more than 20 hours a&#13;
week. In Slovakia, accumulation of benefits with earnings from work is possible only if the&#13;
monthly net income from occasional work is less than 65 percent of the subsistence minimum&#13;
(plus income taxes and contributions). In Slovenia, accumulated work earnings is permissible&#13;
up to â&#130;¬ 200 per month (MISSOC 2011).&#13;
&#13;
A rapid return to work is supported by other types of incentives and benefits. In Serbia, a&#13;
recipient of unemployment benefits for at least three months, who establishes an open-ended&#13;
working relationship with PES, is entitled to a one-time incentive for employment in the&#13;
amount of 30 percent of the total amount of monetary compensation which would have been&#13;
paid for the time remaining until the expiration of the right to financial compensation. In&#13;
Croatia, Serbia, and Ukraine, as noted above, a cash compensation (unemployment benefit) for&#13;
the whole period of eligibility may be paid in a one-time (lump-sum) amount to launch self-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               89&#13;
&amp;#12;employment at the request of the unemployed. Bulgaria has a benefit for partial&#13;
unemployment: Persons who are hired to work part-time within the terms of the benefits&#13;
payment and receive a remuneration less than the minimum national wage can receive 50&#13;
percent of the benefits they would receive if totally unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
Several countries provide pension and disability insurance to recipients of unemployment&#13;
benefits and pay social contributions to the relevant funds, ensuring that job tenure for pension&#13;
purposes will not be interrupted.&#13;
&#13;
In Slovakia, employed or self-employed individuals can apply for an allowance for commuting to&#13;
work, which pays monthly travel expenses from the place of residence of the employee to the&#13;
place of employment provided in the employment contract or implementation of self-&#13;
employment. Allowance for commuting can be provided to those who were registered as&#13;
jobseekers at least three months and found a job.&#13;
&#13;
In Serbia, the beneficiary of unemployment benefits has the right to health, pension, and&#13;
disability insurance while exercising the right to financial compensation. In addition, the whole&#13;
family of the beneficiary has the right to health insurance if they are not insured on another&#13;
basis.&#13;
&#13;
In the Czech Republic, the state pays health insurance contributions for registered jobseekers,&#13;
and jobseekers receive credit toward their pension insurance for a certain amount of time&#13;
registered in the PES database. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, pension and disability insurance is&#13;
ensured to unemployed persons lacking up to three years of pension history to meet the&#13;
conditions for an old age pension.&#13;
&#13;
Mobility grant. A refund for relocation costs (mobility grant) is provided in several ECA&#13;
countries if the new place of work was referred to and agreed upon by PES. In Moldova,&#13;
unemployed persons who have found a job and whose residence is more than 50 km from the&#13;
place of employment may receive a lump-sum payment for resettlement in the amount of&#13;
three average monthly salaries over the previous year.&#13;
&#13;
Social support to the unemployed during temporary incapacity and for maternity leave. Other&#13;
social benefits have been established for unemployed jobseekers. In Kyrgyzstan,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               90&#13;
&amp;#12;unemployment beneficiaries or individuals receiving a training stipend can apply for sick leave&#13;
benefits and maternity leave benefits (females) during which the jobsearch requirements are&#13;
relaxed and the benefits payment period is extended.&#13;
&#13;
Funeral benefit. The family of the deceased person may receive funeral benefits in the case of&#13;
death of the unemployed individual, for example, in Armenia for the person who had more&#13;
than one year of social insurance. In Latvia, in the case of the death of an unemployed person,&#13;
the family members or a designated person have a right to funeral benefits if the deceased&#13;
unemployed person was a recipient of unemployment benefits or unemployment insurance&#13;
contributions were made for such person for not less than 12 months within the time period of&#13;
36 months prior to the day when the status of an unemployed person was obtained. Funeral&#13;
benefits are granted in the amount of triple the state social assistance benefit in effect on the&#13;
day of the death of the unemployed person.&#13;
&#13;
Taxation of benefits and social contributions on benefits. In some of the reviewed countries,&#13;
such as Malta, Poland, Slovenia, and Hungary (except for the jobseeker aid for older persons),&#13;
benefits are subject to taxation according to general taxation rules (i.e., there is no special relief&#13;
for benefits).&#13;
&#13;
In some countries, PES pay social security contributions from the benefits. In Estonia, the&#13;
Unemployment Insurance Fund pays a social tax at the rate of 13 percent for health insurance&#13;
and contributes 2 percent to the mandatory pension fund on the behalf of recipients of&#13;
unemployment insurance benefits. The Fund pays a social tax at the rate of 13 percent for&#13;
health insurance on behalf of recipients of an unemployment allowance as well as for those&#13;
who do not receive it but have registered as unemployed. In Poland, contributions for health&#13;
care, old age, invalidity, and survivors' insurance are paid on behalf of the recipients of&#13;
unemployment allowance, and contributions are made for healthcare â&#128;&#147; for recipients of early&#13;
retirement benefits and a bridge pension (MISSOC 2011).&#13;
&#13;
In most other countries in the sample, no contributions were paid on behalf of the&#13;
unemployed. All unemployed (both receiving and not receiving unemployment benefits)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 91&#13;
&amp;#12;received health insurance through the State. Often the recipients of unemployment benefits&#13;
are also insured for their pension insurance by the State.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the large number of various benefits and entitlements, in most countries the number of&#13;
recipients is relatively small.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;IV.          Benefits and Other Sanctions&#13;
&#13;
Countries are actively using benefits and other sanctions to discipline jobseekers for various&#13;
violations of employment promotion laws, on the one hand, and to encourage active jobsearch,&#13;
on the other. The types of sanctions in the reviewed countries to be analyzed in this chapter&#13;
include:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)     Deletion from the unemployment records&#13;
      (ii)    Suspension of benefits payment&#13;
      (iii) Shortening of the duration of benefits payment&#13;
      (iv) Waiting period to receive benefits&#13;
      (v)     Reduction in the amount of benefits&#13;
      (vi) Premature termination of benefits payment&#13;
      (vii) Non-granting of unemployment insurance benefits.&#13;
&#13;
The effect of sanctions of unemployment insurance benefits on the exit rate from&#13;
unemployment might be significant, and even moderate sanctions increase the exit rate by&#13;
more than 50 percent following the imposition of a sanction (Svarrer 2007). Lalive et al. (2002)&#13;
show that there is a 28 percent increase in the hazard rate at the time when an unemployed&#13;
person receives a written warning from the authorities that a sanction is pending due to&#13;
suspicion of insufficient search activity. They also find indications that the sanctioning system&#13;
affects the search intensity even before a warning is received.&#13;
&#13;
The principle of conditionality is applied in most European countries, and receiving state&#13;
unemployment benefits is dependent upon the participation in employment programs or the&#13;
use of particular services. The applied criteria of conditionality typically include obligations to&#13;
actively search for a job and participate in training or other employment measures to maintain&#13;
unemployment benefits, or face sanctions. Additionally, the regular follow-up procedures, such&#13;
as registration and frequent reporting obligations, supplement these obligations (EC 2009).&#13;
&#13;
The ILO Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention No. 168,&#13;
1988, highlights possible reasons for benefit sanctions as follows (Articles 20 and 21):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    93&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;&#156;The benefit to which a protected person would have been entitled in the cases of full or partial&#13;
unemployment or suspension of earnings due to a temporary suspension of work without any&#13;
break in the employment relationship may be refused, withdrawn, suspended or reduced to the&#13;
extent prescribed:&#13;
&#13;
   (a) For as long as the person concerned is absent from the territory of the Member&#13;
&#13;
   (b) When it has been determined by the competent authority that the person concerned&#13;
       had deliberately contributed to his or her own dismissal&#13;
&#13;
   (c) When it has been determined by the competent authority that the person concerned&#13;
       has left employment voluntarily without just cause&#13;
&#13;
   (d) During the period of a labor dispute, when the person concerned has stopped work to&#13;
       part in a labor dispute or when he or she is prevented from working as a direct result of&#13;
       a stoppage of work due to this labor dispute&#13;
&#13;
   (e) When the person concerned has attempted to obtain or has obtained benefits&#13;
       fraudulently&#13;
&#13;
   (f) When the person concerned has failed without just cause to use the facilities available&#13;
       for placement, vocational guidance, training, retraining, or redeployment in suitable&#13;
       work&#13;
&#13;
   (g) As long as the person concerned is in receipt of another income maintenance benefit&#13;
       provided for in the legislation of the Member concerned, except a family benefit,&#13;
       provided that the part of the benefit which is suspended does not exceed that other&#13;
       benefit.&#13;
&#13;
The benefit to which a protected person would have been entitled in the case of full&#13;
unemployment may be refused, withdrawn, suspended, or reduced, to the extent prescribed,&#13;
when the person concerned refuses to accept suitable employment.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
The countries are activity using these guidelines in their national policy framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               94&#13;
&amp;#12;There might be different reasons for being deregistered from the roster of the unemployed:&#13;
becoming employed, reaching retirement age, voluntary deregistration, etc. (see for example&#13;
the case of Estonia in Table 12).&#13;

&#13;
As noted in the previous chapter, in most of the reviewed countries only a small portion of the&#13;
registered unemployed receive unemployment benefits, which limits the imposition of benefit&#13;
sanctions. However, other types of sanctions are extensively used.&#13;
&#13;
Deleted from the roster of unemployed. The most common sanction used by PES in the&#13;
reviewed countries is deleting the person from the roster of unemployed for a period of time.&#13;
Typical reasons are the failure to report to the PES without justification â&#128;&#147; for the first-time or&#13;
repeatedly; refusal to accept a suitable job offer; failure to meet the conditions of actively&#13;
seeking employment and availability for work; or working informally while registered as&#13;
unemployed. The reason for termination of the status of the unemployed person might also be&#13;
the refusal, without good reason, to participate in active labor market programs, such as&#13;
training or public works (Belarus, Russia, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
13&#13;
   Exit to work is underestimated, because this cause only appears if a person reports his or her exit to work. Very&#13;
likely quite some people who are deregistered because of not visiting the Unemployment Insurance Fund, have&#13;
also started a job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        95&#13;
&amp;#12;In Croatia, a person may lose the status of the unemployed if he/she registers a company or&#13;
some other legal entity; or acquires a majority stake in a company or some other legal entity; or&#13;
registers a craft, an independent professional activity, or activity in the field of agriculture and&#13;
forestry; or becomes insured as a farmer pursuant to the pension insurance regulations (since&#13;
farmers are prohibited from being registered as unemployed).&#13;
&#13;
The data shows that this measure is used quite frequently by PES (Figure 9). In Belarus in 2009,&#13;
around 80,000 jobseekers were deleted from the roster during the year while the average&#13;
annual number of jobseekers was 42,000; in Moldova, 41,000 jobseekers were deleted while&#13;
the average annual number of jobseekers was 35,000. A large portion of the inflows and&#13;
outflows of jobseekers is related to deregistration and re-registration of the unemployed. When&#13;
many of the registered jobseekers actually find a job, they do not respond to offers from PES or&#13;
informed the PES about their employment status; as a result, they are erased from the roster.&#13;

&amp;#12;Some countries have established time limits for remaining on the unemployed roster. For&#13;
example, in Belarus, removal from the registry occurs 36 calendar months from the date of&#13;
registration as an unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
Following deregistration, the person must have the right to re-register. In the reviewed&#13;
countries, this waiting period for re-registration varies from one month after being erased from&#13;
the roster in Uzbekistan to the expiry of 12 months in Belarus and Bulgaria (see Table 13). Over&#13;
the course of unemployment spell many jobseekers might be excluded from the roster multiple&#13;
times.&#13;
&#13;
There also are restrictions in which these rules do not apply. In Kyrgyzstan, for example, an&#13;
unemployed person does not lose the status of unemployed during a temporary inability to&#13;
work, during a pregnancy as based on a certificate from the physician, or during entitled&#13;
maternity benefits after childbirth.&#13;
&#13;
De-registration mechanisms and â&#128;&#156;exitâ&#128;? strategies are especially important in many developing&#13;
countries that have public employment services. In several MENA countries, the number of&#13;
registered jobseekers significantly exceeds the number of unemployed, by the labor force&#13;
survey data, indicating that many registered jobseekers are de facto economically inactive or&#13;
informally employed. In Egypt, the number of registered jobseekers exceeds survey data on&#13;
unemployment by a factor of 3.5, 14 in Morocco by a factor of 4.4, and in Tunisia by a factor of 2.&#13;
In these countries, PES are overburdened in serving or keeping the roster of individuals who are&#13;
not unemployed, by ILO criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
  In Egypt, registration of jobseekers is mandatory by law. Jobseekers need to present a certification indicating&#13;
their skills and educational level.&#13;

&amp;#12;Suspension of benefit payment. In some countries, the payment of unemployment benefits&#13;
can be suspended. In Estonia, for example, benefits can be suspended for a period of 10 days if&#13;
the unemployed person refuses suitable work for the first time without a good reason and for a&#13;
period of 30 days, if the unemployed person receives an income in the amount equal to at least&#13;
31-fold of daily unemployment allowance rate.&#13;
&#13;
In Russia, payment of unemployment benefits may be suspended for up to three months in the&#13;
following cases: (i) failure to accept the two options of suitable work or (ii) failure after a three-&#13;
month period of unemployment to participate in paid public works or training programs. The&#13;
latter restriction concerns first-time jobseekers (previously not employed) and non-&#13;
professionals (without specialty) or those individuals seeking to resume work after a long (more&#13;
than one year) break.&#13;
&#13;
In Kyrgyzstan, payment of unemployment benefits may be suspended for one month for failure&#13;
to appear, without good reason, to negotiate employment with the employer selected by the&#13;
PES within three days from the suggested by PES date.&#13;
&#13;
Shortening of the duration of benefit payment. In Ukraine, the duration of payment of&#13;
unemployment benefits or financial assistance during training, retraining, or training can be&#13;
reduced for up to 90 days if the person is released from his/her last job at own will, without&#13;
good reason, or by agreement of the parties.&#13;
&#13;
Waiting period to renew the benefits payment. The waiting period might be established for&#13;
renewing the benefits payment. In Armenia, unemployed individuals who have been granted&#13;
the status of an unemployed more than once can receive benefits only one year after being&#13;
dropped from the PES register.&#13;
&#13;
Reduction in benefits. One of the sanctions in employment promotion legislation in some&#13;
countries is a reduction in the amount of unemployment benefits. For example, in Ukraine, in&#13;
the case of failure to participate in paid public works, without good reason, if such work is&#13;
suitable, the amount of unemployment benefits may be reduced by 50 percent for up to three&#13;
months. In Russia, the size of unemployment benefits may be reduced by 25 percent for up to&#13;
one month for failure to appear, without good reason, to negotiate with the employer a new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 99&#13;
&amp;#12;job within three days of the indicated by PES date, and for failure, without good reason, to&#13;
come to PES offices to obtain directions to work or training. In Montenegro, the recipient of the&#13;
unemployment benefit who refuses appropriate temporary or casual work will have a 30&#13;
percent reduction of unemployment allowance for a period of two months.&#13;
&#13;
Premature termination of benefit payments. Premature termination of benefits payments is&#13;
also envisaged in the employment legislation in some countries. For example, in South Africa,&#13;
an unemployed contributor is not entitled to benefits for failure to report at the times and&#13;
dates stipulated by the claims officer, or for refusal, without just cause, to undergo training and&#13;
vocational counseling for employment.&#13;
&#13;
In Estonia, the benefits payment is suspended prematurely if the unemployed person fails to&#13;
appear, without a good reason, at the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund for the second&#13;
time; or the unemployed person refuses, without good reason, to comply with an Individual&#13;
Action Plan for the second time; or the unemployed person refuses, without good reason, to&#13;
accept suitable work for the second time.&#13;
&#13;
Also in Uzbekistan, payment of the unemployment benefit ceases if the unemployed person&#13;
fails to accept two proposals of suitable work, or an unemployed man at age less than 35 years&#13;
and with less than three dependents refuses to participate in paid public works.&#13;
&#13;
Non-granting of unemployment insurance benefit. In some countries, benefits may not be&#13;
granted altogether even if the person is eligible. In Lithuania, the unemployment insurance&#13;
benefit may not be granted if, prior to its granting, the unemployed person refused a job offer&#13;
corresponding to his or her professional qualifications and state of health; refused for no good&#13;
reason to participate in ALMP measures laid down in his Individual Employment Plan; failed,&#13;
without good reason, to arrive at a set time at the local PES to accept a job offer or to&#13;
participate in ALMP measures, laid down in his or her Individual Employment Plan; or refused&#13;
to undergo a health check offered by the local PES in order to establish suitability for work.&#13;
&#13;
In Belarus, the granting of unemployment benefits may be denied if termination of the&#13;
employment contract that is concluded for an indefinite period occurred on his/her own will, by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               100&#13;
&amp;#12;agreement of the parties as well as due to the dismissal for violations of work discipline, or the&#13;
loss (lack of) a source of income as a result of illegal actions.&#13;
&#13;
In Montenegro, the right to financial compensation is denied when the insured individual has&#13;
been dismissed:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   In agreement with the employer or the employee's written statement&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Because of unjustified absence from work five consecutive working days, or seven&#13;
        working days with interruptions over three months&#13;
    â&#128;¢   For refusing to transfer to another position or employer&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Due to the measures imposed for breach of obligations.&#13;
&#13;
In sum, PES have multiple instruments available to sanction jobseekers, be it for failure to meet&#13;
the conditions of actively seeking employment and availability for work; for working illegally; or&#13;
for refusal, without good reason, to take up suitable employment; for refusal to undergo a&#13;
medical examination; for failure to cooperate with PES or to fulfil the conditions stipulated in&#13;
her/his Individual Employment Plan; or for other reasons. Most sanctions are benefit sanctions&#13;
but due to limited recipiency rates of unemployment benefits, have limited impact on the&#13;
actions of jobseekers. The most commonly used sanction is temporary exclusion from the&#13;
roster of unemployed, which is actively utilized in most of the reviewed countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  101&#13;
&amp;#12;V.     Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
The reviewed countries use a variety of instruments to â&#128;&#156;activateâ&#128;? jobseekers with an aim to&#13;
encourage them to become more active in their efforts to find work and/or improve their&#13;
employability. Jobseekers need to be made aware that individuals themselves are responsible&#13;
for solving their own situation in the labor market. However, the practices on activation policies&#13;
vary considerably across countries.&#13;
&#13;
Numerous factors and constraints affect the firm implementation of activation policies, and the&#13;
outcomes vary. The main findings and recommendations of the report are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
Difficult labor market situation. Employment services in many countries operate in a very&#13;
difficult environment of demand-deficient labor markets and in several countries, double-digit&#13;
unemployment rates. One of the consequences that impact activation is the large number of&#13;
registered unemployed competing for the limited number of job vacancies offered by&#13;
employment services. Moreover, the bulk of PES-registered vacancies are for low-paid blue&#13;
collar jobs offering around the minimum wage for unskilled labor, working under harmful&#13;
conditions, and in public sector enterprises, which make them unattractive among jobseekers.&#13;
Also, many job offers are not accepted because they might not fit the criteria of suitable job for&#13;
a particular jobseeker. As a result, many jobseekers in the reviewed countries rely solely on&#13;
personal and family connections as the main way to find suitable employers, and many job&#13;
placements occur without an intermediation role of PES.&#13;
&#13;
Overburdened with clients who are not actively looking for a job. In many of the reviewed&#13;
countries, registered unemployment significantly exceeds survey-based unemployment rates&#13;
(mostly in Central Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans, and in some MENA countries). Cash&#13;
benefits and other entitlements like health insurance or social assistance often act as incentives&#13;
for jobseekers or even economically inactive individuals to register with PES. Thus, the PES staff&#13;
in many countries is overburdened with serving registered jobseekers who are actually not&#13;
actively looking for jobs. One of the goals of activation policies should be to select and self-&#13;
select those individuals from â&#128;&#156;trueâ&#128;? jobseekers using various policy instruments, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               102&#13;
&amp;#12;incentives, such as one-time incentive for employment in case of early placement like in Serbia,&#13;
or various benefits and other sanctions.&#13;
&#13;
Reaching out to unemployed jobseekers. In some other countries, such as the Baltic states and&#13;
CIS countries, registered unemployment is much lower than survey-based unemployment,&#13;
primarily due to low access to unemployment benefits and active labor market programs. Low&#13;
registration rates and low numbers of unemployed beneficiaries, especially in many CIS states,&#13;
indicate that PES in these countries fail to reach the majority of jobseekers. Improving the&#13;
coverage and efficacy of the programs â&#128;&#147; both employment services and ALMPs but also&#13;
providing unemployment benefits â&#128;&#147; would improve the rate of registration of jobseekers and&#13;
outcomes of the programs in terms of job placements.&#13;
&#13;
Address staffing constraints. Policies based on activation principles require more skilled&#13;
personnel for the provision of employment services and ALMPs. In the reviewed countries,&#13;
most PES are understaffed both in terms of numbers and skills. The number of front-line&#13;
counselors/advisers is inadequate for delivering ALMPs, specifically effective and personalized&#13;
mediation services. High caseloads limit implementation of policies based on activation&#13;
principles, including regular reporting and confirmation of unemployment status by jobseekers,&#13;
as well as opportunities for job counselors to monitor and encourage jobsearch and deliver&#13;
information. Countries should plan, hire and train their staff to meet demands for services,&#13;
especially the demands for the most vulnerable who are the hardest to serve.&#13;
&#13;
Broaden the menu of services. Activation policies increasingly include a range of new&#13;
management approaches and services for the unemployed. Elements of enhanced services&#13;
include individualized back-to-work action plans, regular monitoring and review of the clientâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
jobsearch status (e.g., through regular meetings between the client and employment officer),&#13;
and a widened set of active labor market programs, covering training, subsidized employment,&#13;
work placement, public works, or special programs for relevant risk groups in the labor market.&#13;
Many countries are also tightening unemployment benefit eligibility and sanctions in case of&#13;
non-compliance with norms so as to incentivize jobsearch.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              103&#13;
&amp;#12;Early registration of jobseekers. A proactive approach of PES also entails that assistance to&#13;
companies and employees in the event of restructuring and mass redundancies takes place&#13;
before employees are made redundant. Rapid registration at the PES allows immediately&#13;
offering the jobseeker/laid-off worker available vacancies, provide employment services, such&#13;
as job counseling and jobsearch assistance, or send him/her to participate in ALMPs, thus&#13;
shortening the transition from one job to another. These policy measures allow PES to rapidly&#13;
intervene and mitigate the impact of redundancies early on.&#13;
&#13;
Improving efficacy through individual approach. The diversity of needs of unemployed&#13;
jobseekers requires a PES service model in which active labor market measures are tailored to&#13;
these needs. Consequently, a personal service model involves the individualization and&#13;
segmentation of PES services and interventions. While some people may not require&#13;
participation in an active measure at all, active labor market measures are essential for others&#13;
to gain skills or work experience to achieve sustainable integration in the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
Focusing on priority groups of jobseekers. Some groups of jobseekers are especially vulnerable&#13;
in the labor market and need specialized services and programs. ALMPs also tend to mainly&#13;
help disadvantaged groups. PES should have tools (e.g., menu of services) and resources in&#13;
hand to address these specific needs. On the other hand, given the limited number of&#13;
registered vacancies and low access/coverage with ALMPs, â&#128;&#156;regular jobseekersâ&#128;? may have no&#13;
chance to compete with these preferential groups in getting an access to employment services&#13;
and ALMPs.&#13;
&#13;
Activation through employment action plans. Many countries have established individual&#13;
action plans for the registered jobseekers as a tool for activation, identifying the activities and&#13;
responsibilities by the jobseeker to reach an employment target. However, some employment&#13;
services may lack office capacity to establish such plans and follow up on their implementation.&#13;
So selection is warranted to focusing on hard-to-place categories of jobseekers.&#13;
&#13;
Enhance outreach and efficacy of ALMPs. Judging from the number of beneficiaries, the most&#13;
popular labor market programs tend to be career counseling and professional orientation,&#13;
jobsearch assistance, training, and public works. However, active programs do have their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               104&#13;
&amp;#12;limitations, including for usage as activation measures. To name a few, they are relatively costly&#13;
and consequently of limited participation in most of the reviewed countries. Their impact is&#13;
limited when job opportunities are scarce. As far as particular programs are concerned, they&#13;
may have other limitations; for example, labor market-related training organized or supported&#13;
by PES cannot substitute for general education and cannot make up for the failings of the&#13;
educational system. Wage subsidies may serve a social objective but it is difficult to design&#13;
subsidies that actually meet the goal of creating jobs in a cost-effective manner. Public works&#13;
programs have proven to be an effective measure for creating short-term employment for truly&#13;
jobless workers if they are carefully targeted and if the wage is set below the equilibrium wage&#13;
for unskilled labor. On the other hand, employment services tend to be the most cost-effective&#13;
intervention with positive outcomes, according to most of the evaluations. These services are&#13;
mostly provided by the staff of the PES themselves. The menu and outreach of particular&#13;
services could be enlarged in most of the reviewed countries focusing on particular needs of&#13;
individual jobseekers.&#13;
&#13;
Improve the coverage with unemployment benefits and other entitlements. Unemployment&#13;
benefits are the â&#128;&#156;first line of defenseâ&#128;? for those experiencing a job loss. However, by Doing&#13;
Business Worker Protection Measure 2012 survey, out of the total of 176 economies in the&#13;
sample, only 86 have unemployment benefit schemes. Moreover, unemployment protection&#13;
schemes might have been put in place, yet many of the registered unemployed are not eligible&#13;
for unemployment benefits. The reason is that the long-term unemployed dominate among the&#13;
registered unemployed who have exhausted their entitlement, or many first-time jobseekers do&#13;
not have a sufficient insurance record to claim benefits. So many jobseekers have limited if any&#13;
incentives to register at the PES and participate in activation programs. Since unemployment&#13;
insurance schemes are uncommon in most of the developing countries, unemployment&#13;
assistance schemes might be introduced conditional on the participation of jobseekers in&#13;
activation programs.&#13;
&#13;
Link benefits to active jobsearch. The right to receive most types of unemployment benefits&#13;
and other entitlements should be directly linked to the active status of jobseekers who are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               105&#13;
&amp;#12;actually looking for jobs. In order to achieve this, eligibility and entitlement rules of some of the&#13;
benefits may need to be changed.&#13;
&#13;
Use other benefits as incentives for activation. Due to low unemployment benefits recipiency&#13;
ratios in most reviewed countries, the usage of (or the threat of) financial sanctions to impose&#13;
and enforce an obligation on the unemployed to actively search for work on the one hand and,&#13;
on the other, to accept reasonable job offers, might be limited. However, other benefits, such&#13;
as social assistance entitlements for the registered unemployed and their families can be&#13;
utilized for the purpose of activation of jobseekers while taking into consideration limits in the&#13;
number of job vacancies or availability of ALMPs.&#13;
&#13;
Use sanctions wisely. The reviewed countries are actively using benefits and other sanctions to&#13;
discipline jobseekers for various violations of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s employment promotion law and to&#13;
encourage active jobsearch. The most commonly used sanction is deleting passive jobseekers&#13;
from the roster of unemployed. However, in many cases, passivity occurs at no fault of the&#13;
jobseeker, especially if there are no appropriate vacancies available and no access to active&#13;
labor market programs is provided. Following deregistration, the person must have the right to&#13;
re-register.&#13;
&#13;
Find the right balance between incentives and sanctions. A significant number of jobseekers&#13;
seem to prefer to become inactive rather than having to participate in certain programs to&#13;
comply with activation policy requirements. It has also been pointed out that imposing a too&#13;
stringent (or too harsh) set of conditions on jobseekers, either in terms of benefits and other&#13;
entitlements or program participation requirements, could eventually reduce the quality of jobs&#13;
and put excessive pressure on jobseekers to accept job offers with lower re-employment&#13;
earnings or a low quality job/match, which can be expected to be only of short duration (see for&#13;
example OECD 2007). Activation policies should find the right balance between incentives to&#13;
register at the PES, participate in services and programs, and receive benefits, on the one hand,&#13;
and sanctions, on the other.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
One of the responses to new challenges in the labor market has been the development and&#13;
expansion of employment services and active labor market policies based on activation&#13;
principles. The objective of this study is to document and review international experiences,&#13;
predominantly from selected emerging market economies and developing countries, with the&#13;
design and implementation of activation programs, provided by Public Employment Services,&#13;
through the prism of incentives and sanctions. Employment promotion legislation from the&#13;
reviewed countries is a major source of information. Participation of beneficiaries in relevant&#13;
services and programs is also analyzed. The study finds that the countries use a variety of&#13;
instruments, be it specific employment services, active labor market programs, or benefit&#13;
and other sanctions, to â&#128;&#156;activateâ&#128;? jobseekers with an aim to encourage them to become&#13;
more active in their efforts to find work and/or improve their employability. In practice, the&#13;
activation policies vary considerably across countries.&#13;
