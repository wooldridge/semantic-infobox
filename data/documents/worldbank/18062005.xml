&#13;
                      MR. SANDSTROM:     All right.     I think we should get&#13;
&#13;
           started.   We have a couple of interesting items on the&#13;
&#13;
           agenda for today.&#13;
&#13;
                      The first one is a proposed credit of 62.4 million&#13;
&#13;
           SDRs to Zambia for a Second Economic and Social Adjustment&#13;
&#13;
           Project.&#13;
&#13;
                      You also received an updating note after the CAS&#13;
&#13;
           discussion which we had on July 18th.&#13;
&#13;
                      We are very happy to welcome again Mr. Basu and&#13;
&#13;
           also Mr. van Til of the IMF, who are sitting there in the&#13;
&#13;
           back.&#13;
&#13;
                      John Todd will introduce the proposal.&#13;
&#13;
                      John, please.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. TODD:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                      Mr. Chairman, Members of the Board:        The Board&#13;
&#13;
           discussion two weeks ago on the Zambia country assistance&#13;
&#13;
           strategy highlighted two central challenges.&#13;
&#13;
                      First, Zambia faces a particularly long and&#13;
&#13;
           difficult task, especially in light of its large external&#13;
&#13;
           debt, in transforming its economy from one of controls,&#13;
&#13;
           parastatals, and dependence on copper to one of diversified,&#13;
&#13;
           private sector led growth.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                       As a result, the strategy will have to be&#13;
&#13;
           carefully designed and consistently implemented.     We believe&#13;
&#13;
           the strategy Zambia has chosen - rapid liberalization and&#13;
&#13;
           extensive privatization in order to unleash a process of&#13;
&#13;
           private sector led growth coupled with increased attention&#13;
&#13;
           to social services and other direct efforts at poverty&#13;
&#13;
           reduction -- is a sound one.&#13;
&#13;
                       The credit before you today is part of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
           continuing support for that program and includes a special&#13;
&#13;
           emphasis on policies that promote the development of more&#13;
&#13;
           efficient private markets and the provision of vital social&#13;
&#13;
           services.&#13;
&#13;
                       The more immediate challenge highlighted by the&#13;
&#13;
           CAS discussion is the uncertain macroeconomic environment.&#13;
&#13;
           In light of this, effectiveness and disbursement of the&#13;
&#13;
           first tranche will take place when we have additional&#13;
&#13;
           evidence of strong macroeconomic policy implementation.&#13;
&#13;
                       We will determine that by sending staff to Lusaka,&#13;
&#13;
           in liaison with the August IMF mission, to look at end-June&#13;
&#13;
           performance against the Fund targets, recent progress in the&#13;
&#13;
           areas of structural reform, including the privatization of&#13;
&#13;
           ZCCM, and the outlook for continued strong performance on&#13;
&#13;
           the macro and structural fronts.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                     As explained in the updating note distributed last&#13;
&#13;
           week to the Board, a determination on the effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
           condition will be based on the findings of that mission.       As&#13;
&#13;
           suggested by many of you, we will also be redoubling our&#13;
&#13;
           efforts to rekindle a constructive dialogue between the&#13;
&#13;
           government and its bilateral partners.       Thus, going forward&#13;
&#13;
           with this credit at this time is intended to provide a&#13;
&#13;
           bridge -- or breathing space -- to enable this dialogue on&#13;
&#13;
           governance issues to resume and thus to make it possible for&#13;
&#13;
           bilateral financing to resume at an early point.&#13;
&#13;
                     Let me turn to the credit itself.        The basic&#13;
&#13;
           approach behind this credit is to focus on some of the&#13;
&#13;
           specific areas that had been supported by the first Economic&#13;
&#13;
           and Social Adjustment Credit approved in 1994.        Several new&#13;
&#13;
           areas have also been added, including procurement reform,&#13;
&#13;
           informal urban settlements and a follow-up on ZCCM&#13;
&#13;
           privatization.&#13;
&#13;
                     In all areas, substantial actions have already&#13;
&#13;
           been taken by government.    Let me give a few examples which&#13;
&#13;
           illustrate the range of issues covered and the strong&#13;
&#13;
           commitment of the government in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
                     In the area of continuing reforms, the historical&#13;
&#13;
           Land Act passed last year is being implemented.        Statutory&#13;

  nm                                                                     7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           instruments acceptable to the Bank have been issued, and the&#13;
&#13;
           Ministry of Lands has begun a program of improving the&#13;
&#13;
           administrative efficiency of processing the sale and&#13;
&#13;
           transfer of leaseholds.&#13;
&#13;
                       In social sector spending, the government has&#13;
&#13;
           managed to meet the strict requirements of the IMF program&#13;
&#13;
           on the fiscal deficit while protecting the agreements on&#13;
&#13;
           social sector spending agreed to under this credit, both for&#13;
&#13;
           aggregate shares and for priority subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
                       In addition, the 1996 budget included a major&#13;
&#13;
           reduction in tariff rates, particularly for capital goods&#13;
&#13;
           and inputs and an elimination of most tariff exemptions,&#13;
&#13;
           including for the government itself, that has made the trade&#13;
&#13;
           regime more conducive to exporters without lowering tariff&#13;
&#13;
           receipts.&#13;
&#13;
                       The government is also moving on public&#13;
&#13;
           procurement reform.    By itself, this program will not end&#13;
&#13;
           all of the problems in this area, but the enhanced&#13;
&#13;
           visibility of this process and the quicker movement towards&#13;
&#13;
           decentralization should open the process to greater&#13;
&#13;
           transparency and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
                       We are also especially pleased about the&#13;
&#13;
           government's increased emphasis on the legal regularization&#13;

&#13;
         of Lusaka's many informal urban settlements.&#13;
&#13;
                   The enhanced security of tenure should bring an&#13;
&#13;
         immediate improvement in the well being of hundreds of&#13;
&#13;
         thousands of inhabitants, as well as a needed boost in&#13;
&#13;
         construction and the launching of new small businesses.&#13;
&#13;
                   The last five years of Zambian economic reform&#13;
&#13;
         program have witnessed considerable accomplishments.        Much&#13;
&#13;
         more remains to be done, however, because as we have seen,&#13;
&#13;
         Zambia's legacy of structural and financial problems is a&#13;
&#13;
         daunting one.   A sound longer-term agenda is set, but to get&#13;
&#13;
         there Zambia will need to meet its current challenges of&#13;
&#13;
         steadying the macro picture, moving ahead with ZCCM&#13;
&#13;
         privatization, and of special importance reestablishing a&#13;
&#13;
         cooperative relationship with all of its external partners.&#13;
&#13;
                   If these challenges are met, Zambia's prospects&#13;
&#13;
         for sustainable growth are reasonable.&#13;
&#13;

           several weeks, taking advantage of the bridge afforded by&#13;
&#13;
           the proposed credit, we will be increasing our efforts to&#13;
&#13;
           encourage the government and its bilateral partners to come&#13;
&#13;
           to a common understanding on economic management and&#13;

           governance actions which will allow a sustainable economic&#13;

&#13;
                     Are there any comments?&#13;
&#13;
                     Huw Evans.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. EVANS:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     I think my colleagues and management will be aware&#13;
&#13;
           that a number of my colleagues, including many of the major&#13;
&#13;
           donors, would have preferred to delay this discussion for a&#13;
&#13;
           further ESAC to Zambia until after the forthcoming Bank/Fund&#13;
&#13;
           staff mission has reported.&#13;
&#13;
                     We very much support the objectives of this ESAC.&#13;
&#13;
           But I have to say that the timing of this approval is wrong.&#13;
&#13;
           We are sympathetic to Zambia's situation.&#13;
&#13;
                     The staff's updating note makes clear that in&#13;
&#13;
           Zambia's huge progress in recent years in carrying through&#13;
&#13;
           its economic reform program, there have been indeed&#13;
&#13;
           occasional and serious setbacks, including missing several&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           of the Fund program benchmarks at the end of last year.&#13;
&#13;
                     But again there have been renewed and successful&#13;
&#13;
           efforts to get back towards the original track.&#13;
&#13;
                     As we know, Zambia is now facing extremely&#13;
&#13;
           difficult circumstances with a big fall in copper prices and&#13;
&#13;
           the drop in assistance from bilateral donors.&#13;
&#13;
                     I very much welcome the improvement we have seen&#13;
&#13;
           in performance this year, although, as we have noted earlier&#13;
&#13;
           in CAS and other discussions, Zambia could and certainly&#13;
&#13;
           should have acted earlier particularly on ZCCM where&#13;
&#13;
           privatization is still somewhere off and where I think the&#13;
&#13;
           company is still being run badly.&#13;
&#13;
                     Continued donor assistance will certainly be&#13;
&#13;
           necessary to support successful reform and higher growth in&#13;
&#13;
           Zambia, which is what we all wish to see.          Further donor&#13;
&#13;
           meetings will certainly be needed, but I cannot see any real&#13;
&#13;
           prospects for success in a meeting as early as September.&#13;
&#13;
                     Now staff tell us that this credit is intended as&#13;
&#13;
           the bridge to give the Zambians time to secure renewed&#13;
&#13;
           bilateral balance of payments assistance and, although the&#13;
&#13;
           Bank papers are strangely silent on this to react to the&#13;
&#13;
           steep fall in the price of copper.&#13;
&#13;
                     We are also waiting for Zambia to get back on&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           track on its macro program so that the ESAF program can&#13;
&#13;
           resume.    As everyone knows, Zambia is currently on a staff&#13;
&#13;
           monitored program.&#13;
&#13;
                       I think hence the importance in next month's&#13;
&#13;
           mission by Fund and Bank staff essentially to do two things:&#13;
&#13;
           first of all, to assess policy performance in recent months;&#13;
&#13;
           and secondly, to assess whether the authorities can mobilize&#13;
&#13;
           sufficient financing.&#13;
&#13;
                       Those two conditions are being brought out clearly&#13;
&#13;
           in the note from Mr. Ouattara of the Fund but not specified&#13;
&#13;
           in that way in the Bank's updating note.&#13;
&#13;
                       I very much hope that both conditions will be met&#13;
&#13;
           so that the ESAF program and all that goes with it can be&#13;
&#13;
           resumed.&#13;
&#13;
                      Now, as I said, Zambia's efforts certainly require&#13;
&#13;
           substantial donor support, including from the Bank, but the&#13;
&#13;
           Bank's efforts have to be part of a viable economic and&#13;
&#13;
           balance of payments picture.        There seem to be real dangers&#13;
&#13;
           in the Bank contributing the bridge to nowhere or&#13;
&#13;
           participating in a seriously under-financed program.&#13;
&#13;
                       I wonder whether the staff can today give us any&#13;
&#13;
           assurances that would help us on this issue of finance for&#13;
&#13;
           the program.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                     That is why I and some of my colleagues would have&#13;
&#13;
           much preferred this discussion to take place in September&#13;
&#13;
           after the report back of the Bank and Fund mission.          And&#13;
&#13;
           while I would like Bank management to give and undertake now&#13;
&#13;
           to report to and consult this Board before this loan becomes&#13;
&#13;
           effective, but failing that undertaking, Mr. Chairman, I&#13;
&#13;
           cannot support the timing of this loan approval and wish to&#13;
&#13;
           be recorded as abstaining in what I regard as a mistaken&#13;
&#13;
           recommendation by management.&#13;
&#13;
                     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. SANDSTROM:      Thank you very much, Huw.&#13;
&#13;
                     We will get back to your questions.&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Li, please.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. LI:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     At the outset, I would like to state that this&#13;
&#13;
           Chair strongly supports the Second Economic and Social&#13;
&#13;
           Adjustment Credit to Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
                     The reasons are as follows.         The first,   I fully&#13;
&#13;
           understand the Zambian Government is facing serious&#13;
&#13;
           macroeconomic challenges, including pressure on balance of&#13;
&#13;
           payments, especially current account difficulties resulting&#13;
&#13;
           from declining copper prices and others.&#13;
&#13;
                     However, the government has already taken measures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                                     507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                                   Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                                       (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  nm                                                                       13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           to counter these challenges.     It is our view that the&#13;
&#13;
           country's economic reform is basically on track.&#13;
&#13;
                     Secondly, Zambia's far-reaching efforts require&#13;
&#13;
           substantial financial resources; support from the&#13;
&#13;
           international community is urgently needed.        The World Bank&#13;
&#13;
           being one of the most important multilateral development&#13;
&#13;
           institutions should not step aside at this critical time of&#13;
&#13;
           Zambia's economic reform.&#13;
&#13;
                     It needs to be stressed that this is exactly the&#13;
&#13;
           right time for the Bank to step in to demonstrate what a&#13;
&#13;
           development institution can really do and to offer our&#13;
&#13;
           timely support to prevent the previous efforts from being&#13;
&#13;
           washed away or the whole Zambian economy from falling apart.&#13;
&#13;
                     Thirdly, Mr. Chairman, as clearly stated by the&#13;
&#13;
           IMF staff during the last Board meeting, implementation of&#13;
&#13;
           the IMF staff monitored program in Zambia to date has been&#13;
&#13;
           satisfactory, and indications are there that the quantity of&#13;
&#13;
           performance targets for end of June were met.&#13;
&#13;
                     The scheduled Fund staff mission in August is to&#13;
&#13;
           confirm, inter alia, satisfactory economic performance which&#13;
&#13;
           carries no presumption that the government failed to meet&#13;
&#13;
           its commitment.   Therefore, there is no justification or&#13;
&#13;
           excuse for the Bank to hold up its proposed credit.&#13;

                                   507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                     Finally, I would like to emphasize that the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
           credit is a timely financial support to Zambia's ongoing&#13;
&#13;
           effort, which addresses serious levels of poverty in the&#13;
&#13;
           country and to achieve significant improvements in living&#13;
&#13;
           standards of all Zambians who deserve our continued support.&#13;
&#13;
                     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much, Mr. Li.&#13;
&#13;
                     Asbjoern Loevbraek.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. LOEVBRAEK:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     This is a rather difficult discussion.       I think&#13;
&#13;
           the difficulty is that there are different perceptions about&#13;
&#13;
           the situation in Zambia, both in terms of the sort of real&#13;
&#13;
           economy and both in terms of the economic reform program&#13;
&#13;
           that the government is undertaking, and also very different&#13;
&#13;
           perceptions as to the assessment which bilateral donor&#13;
&#13;
           agencies are undertaking.&#13;
&#13;
                     We would have preferred postponement of this&#13;
&#13;
           discussion and approval of this adjustment credit until&#13;
&#13;
           after the IMF/Bank mission in August.&#13;
&#13;
                     We took that view on the basis of assessing the&#13;
&#13;
           project documentation,     The updating note that we have got&#13;
&#13;
           from staff had not changed our view at all on that point.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I am also entering into the discussion with basically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                                   507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           the same position as Huw Evans has taken, that we would&#13;
&#13;
           abstain if we don't have assurances of sort of a second&#13;
&#13;
           discussion or the possibility of the second discussion on&#13;
&#13;
           releasing the funds under this adjustment credit.&#13;
&#13;
                     A little bit more detail on what are the&#13;
&#13;
           differences in perception, fortunately it doesn't happen&#13;
&#13;
           very often that we these days get an assessment from our&#13;
&#13;
           bilateral agencies which is very contradictory to the&#13;
&#13;
           assessment that the Bank is doing.&#13;
&#13;
                     But frankly, with the Nordic countries ten years&#13;
&#13;
           ago, it happened much more frequently than it does today.&#13;
&#13;
           But in this particular case in Zambia, I am a bit worried&#13;
&#13;
           that the assessment that we get from our bilateral aid&#13;
&#13;
           agency representatives in our embassies in Lusaka contradict&#13;
&#13;
           what the Bank is saying.&#13;
&#13;
                     Now, of course, for a Board member that leaves the&#13;
&#13;
           question who you should trust, and my personal view is that&#13;
&#13;
           I would not automatically side with my bilateral people.&#13;
&#13;
           But in this particular case I do.&#13;
&#13;
                     So, basically just to give you the flavor of some&#13;
&#13;
           of the arguments that they have been putting forward, they&#13;
&#13;
           do have a more critical assessment both of the fundamentals&#13;
&#13;
           of the economy in Zambia.    They do think that the Bank and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           Fund estimation of the situation is too optimistic.        They do&#13;
&#13;
           point to problems with the implementation of budget&#13;
&#13;
           decisions that have been taken for this year.        For instance,&#13;
&#13;
           that it seems that consumption expenditures and capital&#13;
&#13;
           investment expenditures are down compared with the budget&#13;
&#13;
           estimates.&#13;
&#13;
                        They look at the budget balance situation.     They&#13;
&#13;
           do look at the accumulation of domestic debt burden, and&#13;
&#13;
           they are also making comments relating to the currency&#13;
&#13;
           situation and the over-valuation of the kwacha, and there&#13;
&#13;
           are a number of other issues that I don't need to go into&#13;
&#13;
           detail on all of them.&#13;
&#13;
                        But I do make a fairly fundamental point, namely&#13;
&#13;
           that the likelihood of bilaterals deciding to release&#13;
&#13;
           balance of payments support for Zambia over the next few&#13;
&#13;
           months is -- let me put it this way -- somewhat limited.&#13;
&#13;
                        Now the Bank's argumentation for approving the&#13;
&#13;
           loan now seems to be based fairly fundamentally on an&#13;
&#13;
           assumption that the bilaterals will come forward with new&#13;
&#13;
           balance of payments support before the election.       That seems&#13;
&#13;
           to be the basis for arguing for the release of this credit,&#13;
&#13;
           for arguing for a donor meeting where one would persuade the&#13;
&#13;
           bilaterals to release balance of payments support.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                      The assessment, at least the Nordic&#13;
&#13;
         representatives in Lusaka, are making is that this is not&#13;
&#13;
         realistic.     So, I think that is a fairly fundamental point&#13;
&#13;
         in getting to a conclusion at least until we have heard more&#13;
&#13;
         specifically from staff whether a second round discussion&#13;
&#13;
         would be possible after the return of the mission, and that&#13;
&#13;
         we are not convinced by the arguments.&#13;
&#13;
                      We still maintain that there should not be a&#13;
&#13;
         decision taken today.       If a decision is taken without an&#13;
&#13;
         assurance, that we will have the opportunity of management&#13;
&#13;
         making a recommendation to the Board on the release of the&#13;
&#13;
         funds and then the Board having an opportunity to discuss,&#13;
&#13;
         to approve or reject, such a recommendation, then we would&#13;
&#13;
         have to abstain.&#13;

&#13;
                      I will not take too long because what I had to say&#13;
&#13;
         has been basically said by Mr. Evans and Mr. Loevbraek.         I&#13;
&#13;
         would like to say that I fully endorse everything they are&#13;
&#13;
         saying.&#13;
&#13;
                      Briefly simply to emphasize a couple of points.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           One is that our preference would have been to see a much&#13;
&#13;
           more coordinated World Bank bilateral donor approach to this&#13;
&#13;
           problem than to one which at this point can be seen as the&#13;
&#13;
           World Bank in some sense working at odds with bilateral&#13;
&#13;
           donors, the latter having withdrawn balance of payments&#13;
&#13;
           support and the former at a point where we are about to&#13;
&#13;
           provide balance of payments support.&#13;
&#13;
                     The issue is clearly one of ultimately -- because&#13;
&#13;
           we are all interested in the long-term success of Zambia --&#13;
&#13;
           of getting a fully funded program, and at this point we are&#13;
&#13;
           not at that situation.   It seems to us that that is the&#13;
&#13;
           primary objective towards which we should be working.&#13;
&#13;
                     We really do appreciate the response of staff&#13;
&#13;
           since our last meeting, where, in fact, they have made a&#13;
&#13;
           couple of suggestions, including this reference to trying to&#13;
&#13;
           work with donors in September.     I think that is very helpful&#13;
&#13;
           and that is very much appreciated.&#13;
&#13;
                     But in some sense, it seems to us that that is&#13;
&#13;
           much more what the orientation of the strategy should be and&#13;
&#13;
           one in which we take an action like this, in a situation,&#13;
&#13;
           where as everyone has said we don't have information and&#13;
&#13;
           where as a Board -- and this is a question of process which&#13;
&#13;
           is important to us -- we are being asked to approve a&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           decision in the absence of information.&#13;
&#13;
                     Despite what Mr. Loevbraek has asked for and would&#13;
&#13;
           like, which I would also like too, I am led to believe that,&#13;
&#13;
           in fact, we will not have the opportunity to discuss the&#13;
&#13;
           results of the mission before disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
                     So, as much as we would like that, as I read the&#13;
&#13;
           documentation that came from some decision back in 1990, it&#13;
&#13;
           is simply not the case, and that is very unfortunate.     So, I&#13;
&#13;
           think it puts the Board in a very difficult situation.&#13;
&#13;
                     The second point which I understand is the&#13;
&#13;
           argument which is the basis of the Bank's strategy which has&#13;
&#13;
           to do with bridging, I don't find in any of the&#13;
&#13;
           documentation the rationale that says over the next six&#13;
&#13;
           weeks, between now and mid-September, that the world is&#13;
&#13;
           going to fall apart.&#13;
&#13;
                     I still have not fully grasped -- and if you could&#13;
&#13;
           comment on that, I would appreciate it -- what is going to&#13;
&#13;
           happen over the August and the first half of September that&#13;
&#13;
           requires the Board to be put in this position of approving&#13;
&#13;
           the loan without the requisite information or the ability to&#13;
&#13;
           look at it in the future before disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
                     I simply don't find that convincing.     As I like to&#13;
&#13;
           use the expression, you know, it is the bridge to nowhere.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           We should be working on the other end of the bridge before&#13;
&#13;
           we start doing what we are doing today.&#13;
&#13;
                     Having said all of that, I recognize that there&#13;
&#13;
           are different approaches to this problem, and we had some&#13;
&#13;
           good discussions with staff a while ago.             Clearly, I&#13;
&#13;
           recognize that there is some chance -- it is not one that I&#13;
&#13;
           would bet on -- that the argument is right and that this&#13;
&#13;
           loan is essential, and you have come to that judgment and I&#13;
&#13;
           understand that, and there is some chance that that is&#13;
&#13;
           right.&#13;
&#13;
                     Secondly, we appreciate the changes that have been&#13;
&#13;
           proposed since our last meeting.        From our point of view,&#13;
&#13;
           they don't go far enough, but we do appreciate that.              And it&#13;
&#13;
           is on that basis that we choose to abstain on this&#13;
&#13;
           particular issue.&#13;

&#13;
                     I don't think anyone here questions the very&#13;
&#13;
           difficult circumstances of the Zambian economy.             We are&#13;
&#13;
           particularly worried by the depth and the tenacity of&#13;
&#13;
           poverty in that country.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                     I think we would all agree also on the importance&#13;
&#13;
           of a viable economic program.     In fact, such a program&#13;
&#13;
           really is essential if Bank resources are going to be used&#13;
&#13;
           effectively.&#13;
&#13;
                     As staff has commented, as have a number of other&#13;
&#13;
           speakers, we are a considerable distance from that point.&#13;
&#13;
           The IMF has not been able to conclude its mid-year cycle&#13;
&#13;
           review of the ESAF program, and has moved Zambia to a less&#13;
&#13;
           stringent staff monitored program.&#13;
&#13;
                     The balance of payments gap has widened&#13;
&#13;
           significantly given the withdrawal of bilateral support and&#13;
&#13;
           the declining copper prices.     Our reports from Lusaka&#13;
&#13;
           indicate the Bank unfortunately is probably overly&#13;
&#13;
           optimistic as to when the situation regarding bilateral&#13;
&#13;
           donors will be normalized.&#13;
&#13;
                     Moreover, fiscal discipline in the pre-election&#13;
&#13;
           environment has been very uneven with significant foreign&#13;
&#13;
           exchange being spent on maintaining an artificially high&#13;
&#13;
           exchange rate, and inflation running two-and-one-half times&#13;
&#13;
           of the original targets.&#13;
&#13;
                     I think the phrase that we are lending into a&#13;
&#13;
           bridge nowhere keeps coming across our minds.      For that&#13;
&#13;
           reason, we believe it is far too premature for the Board to&#13;

&#13;
           would like to be recorded as opposing.&#13;

&#13;
           Social Adjustment Credit for Zambia.         The recent note&#13;
&#13;
           circulated by staff confirms many of the macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
           trends that emerged during the CAS discussion.&#13;
&#13;
                     In the main, Zambia has made considerable progress&#13;
&#13;
           in implementing its economic reform program in the past few&#13;
&#13;
           years and the corrections made to counter mid-course&#13;
&#13;
           slippage confirm that the policy orientation of the&#13;
&#13;
           authorities is correct.     This is further confirmed by recent&#13;
&#13;
           initiatives on the structural front, particularly on trade&#13;
&#13;
           policy and privatization.&#13;
&#13;
                     The certification provided by the IMF Fund was not&#13;
&#13;
           really necessary.    We believe that the Bank report on the&#13;

&#13;
           However, we welcome Mr. Ouattara's assessment to the effect&#13;
&#13;
           that end-June ESAF targets appear to have been met and that&#13;
&#13;
           the Zambian authorities should not be faulted for the&#13;
&#13;
           setbacks of the early 1996 period, the blame for which can&#13;
&#13;
           be laid at the door of the problems of the ZCCM, complicated&#13;
&#13;
           further by the reduction in bilateral support.&#13;
&#13;
                     This, in fact, is a self-fulfilling prophesy we&#13;
&#13;
           often encounter.   Balance of payments assistance gets&#13;
&#13;
           chopped off, reflecting concerns about economic performance&#13;
&#13;
           and governance issues.    This in itself causes a further&#13;
&#13;
           decline in economic performance.&#13;
&#13;
                     To the extent that the Fund supervision will help&#13;
&#13;
           the authorities directly address issues relating to the&#13;
&#13;
           management and performance of the ZCCM, fiscal adjustments&#13;
&#13;
           aimed at reducing debt one percentage point of GDP,&#13;
&#13;
           rebuilding international reserves and moving ahead with the&#13;
&#13;
           Bank supervision, the World Bank is then free to focus on&#13;
&#13;
           other aspects.&#13;
&#13;
                     To the extent that both prudent advice and&#13;
&#13;
           development assistance are eventually fungible across&#13;
&#13;
           sectors, we see the proposed credit as not merely&#13;

           cofinancing the Fund program for macroeconomic management.&#13;
&#13;
           Of course, we accept that the benchmarks should be linked to&#13;
&#13;
           continued progress in satisfactory implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
           macroeconomic program.&#13;
&#13;
                     But this is an opportunity for the authorities to&#13;
&#13;
           address the social services through the social safety net&#13;
&#13;
           programs and the public procurement process.&#13;
&#13;
                     The lot of the poor particularly can come under&#13;
&#13;
           severe pressure with the liberalization of trade and prices&#13;
&#13;
           and we, therefore, endorse the proposed growth strategy that&#13;
&#13;
           would seek to improve terms of trade in agriculture, while&#13;
&#13;
           facilitating enhanced productivity and improving beneficiary&#13;

           various initiatives that can be covered under the project&#13;
&#13;
           but can agree with the report on some of the main priorities&#13;
&#13;
           the authorities need to address:      first,   initiating the&#13;
&#13;
           process of land transfer to enable a stepped-up investment&#13;
&#13;
           in agriculturei second, moving further on the national&#13;
&#13;
           housing policy document, including addressing the problems&#13;
&#13;
           of the informal urban settlementsi third, reform of labor&#13;
&#13;
           regulationsi fourth, maintaining the budget allocation on&#13;
&#13;
           the social sectors with further focus on the national drugs&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           policy and nutrition policy.&#13;
&#13;
                     Finally, we can endorse the report's focus on&#13;
&#13;
           capacity building and ownership of the program by the&#13;
&#13;
           Zambian authorities, both measures vital for the eventual&#13;
&#13;
           success of their efforts.     Zambia is one of the most&#13;
&#13;
           indebted low-income countries and we feel it would benefit&#13;
&#13;
           from a strong endorsement of the credit by this Board.&#13;

                     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;

                     MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much, Mr. Rahman.&#13;

                     Helmut Schaffer, please.&#13;

&#13;
                     We worry about the same questions that were raised&#13;
&#13;
           in the circulated statement by Arnaud Chneiweiss.      The&#13;
&#13;
           reasons given for proceeding now have not been able to&#13;
&#13;
           address these preoccupations sufficiently and, therefore, we&#13;
&#13;
           remain rather unconvinced.&#13;
&#13;
                     It is not satisfactory and risky for IDA to submit&#13;
&#13;
           to the Board a bridge financing arrangement in a situation&#13;
&#13;
           where we face a high degree of insecurity with an overall&#13;
&#13;
           under-financed program.&#13;
&#13;
                     Like others, we would have preferred to discuss&#13;
&#13;
           this credit upon the return of the joint mission of the IMF&#13;
&#13;
           and the Bank and with a clear outlook for a viable program&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           that we then can support.&#13;
&#13;
                     As I pointed out in the CAS discussion, we were&#13;
&#13;
           not convinced that Zambia is meeting the criteria for the&#13;
&#13;
           high-case scenario.&#13;
&#13;
                     On the other hand, we see the difficult situation&#13;
&#13;
           of this country.   The bilaterals are an important element&#13;
&#13;
           for closing Zambia's financing gap and we very much hope&#13;
&#13;
           that the Zambian Government will secure this support because&#13;
&#13;
           it is in their hands and within the reach of their decision-&#13;
&#13;
           making to achieve this needed financial support in order to&#13;

                     MRS. HERFKENS:     Sven, I am not sure if this is&#13;
&#13;
           useful if I reiterate my position at this stage, but, as Huw&#13;
&#13;
           Evans started by saying that he reflected the view of many&#13;
&#13;
           major donors and representing at least one major donor, I&#13;
&#13;
           would like to reiterate       and let me just cite The Hague to&#13;
&#13;
           prevent any questioning on whose behalf I speak -- "if based&#13;
&#13;
           on economic performance criteria only, the second ESAC&#13;
&#13;
           should be approved by the Executive Directors".&#13;

  nm                                                                         27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     Clearly, there is a huge difference of opinion&#13;
&#13;
           among donors about the reasons why they withdrew balance of&#13;
&#13;
           payments assistance.      I clearly represent one that does&#13;
&#13;
           that, not for reasons of economic performance.        I find it&#13;
&#13;
           very disturbing that the Bank should follow, given the&#13;
&#13;
           background of these reasons.&#13;
&#13;
                     So, I do support the credit very much because it&#13;
&#13;
           is not the Bank business to be involved in these issues of&#13;
&#13;
           non-economic governance, and I also would like to say that I&#13;
&#13;
           find it disturbing that we would set a precedent in which&#13;
&#13;
           the Board would be involved in judging if effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
           conditions are met.      I would find that very disturbing, but&#13;
&#13;
           maybe I am in a minority.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. SANDSTROM:       Thank you very much, Eveline.&#13;
&#13;
                     Maybe this is a good time actually to respond to&#13;
&#13;
           two or three points that have come up.&#13;
&#13;
                     I would first ask Daoud to describe the procedure&#13;
&#13;
           agreed by the Board for deciding on effectiveness conditions&#13;
&#13;
           and tranche releases and then Callisto to comment on the&#13;
&#13;
           differing perceptions within bilaterals and staff and on the&#13;
&#13;
           funding prospects.&#13;
&#13;
                     I think it would be good to get these comments in&#13;
&#13;
           now before we continue.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                     I have four or five speakers more, but let's take&#13;
&#13;
           a break right now.&#13;
&#13;
                     Daoud.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. KHAIRALLAH:       Well, the established practice of&#13;
&#13;
           the Bank and IDA based on the provisions of the Articles of&#13;
&#13;
           Agreement as consistently applied to all loans and credits&#13;
&#13;
           has been that the Executive Directors approve the conditions&#13;
&#13;
           of Bank loans and IDA credits and that management determine&#13;
&#13;
           whether these conditions have been met.&#13;
&#13;
                     If these conditions have not been met, management&#13;
&#13;
           does not disburse and may seek Board approval of amending&#13;
&#13;
           these conditions.&#13;
&#13;
                     Now this policy has been approved by the Board&#13;
&#13;
           back in June 1990 and basically states the following:&#13;
&#13;
           Management will be responsible for determining whether&#13;
&#13;
           conditions have been fulfilled.         If it is satisfied that&#13;
&#13;
           they have been fulfilled on all material grounds, then it&#13;
&#13;
           releases the tranche in question and immediately inform the&#13;
&#13;
           Board so the Board can exercise oversight over management.&#13;
&#13;
                     If management determines that the fulfillment has&#13;
&#13;
           not taken place in a satisfactory manner, then it would&#13;
&#13;
           decide either to suspend or cancel or, if it finds reason&#13;
&#13;
           either to amend the conditions or to waive them, it brings&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           the matter to the attention of the Board who will decide&#13;
&#13;
           then.&#13;
&#13;
                     This has been the practice and I don't see reason&#13;
&#13;
           for departing from it.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much, Daoud.    It is&#13;
&#13;
           very clear in the minutes of the Board meeting on this that&#13;
&#13;
           if the conditions have been fulfilled, the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
           contractually obligated to release the tranche.&#13;
&#13;
                     But if there are doubts, that is when the&#13;
&#13;
           management comes back to the Board and that decision is left&#13;
&#13;
           up to the management.&#13;
&#13;
                     So, this is very clear and this is the way we have&#13;
&#13;
           consistently applied this.&#13;
&#13;
                     Huw Evans.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. EVANS:     I don't think, Mr. Chairman, this is a&#13;
&#13;
           legal problem.   The fact is nobody, and certainly not I, is&#13;
&#13;
           suggesting that we change our basic policy. There willÂ· be&#13;
&#13;
           the difficult decision to make when management sees the&#13;
&#13;
           results of the mission in August.&#13;
&#13;
                     As I made clear in my statement, I thought that&#13;
&#13;
           the conditions for disbursement set out in the updating note&#13;
&#13;
           were not sufficient in that they did not include any&#13;
&#13;
           reference to a fully financed program.       Therefore, that is&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           one of the reasons why I say I don't think this appeal to&#13;
&#13;
           this 1990 decision is important for our decision today.&#13;

                     Callisto.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. MADAVO:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     Let me make three points.         The first one is&#13;
&#13;
           obviously that it is fundamental that the bilaterals come&#13;
&#13;
           back to the table if we are going to have a program that is&#13;
&#13;
           fully funded.   There is absolutely no question about that.&#13;
&#13;
                     Now in looking at the prospects for this coming&#13;
&#13;
           about, we have to look at two things that drive, in fact,&#13;
&#13;
           the position of the bilaterals.       On the one hand are the&#13;
&#13;
           economic factors:     the strength of the program, the&#13;
&#13;
           performance to date and so on.&#13;
&#13;
                     On the other hand, it is very important that we&#13;
&#13;
           all be honest and be very clear that it is their governance&#13;
&#13;
           preoccupations that also drive the position of the&#13;
&#13;
           bilaterals.&#13;
&#13;
                     What we, the staff, are saying is that on the&#13;
&#13;
           economic side, we working together with the Fund have seen&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           progress by the authorities in addressing the shortfalls&#13;
&#13;
           that occurred in the Fund program in December, at the end of&#13;
&#13;
           December last year.&#13;
&#13;
                      We are, however, very conscious of the fact that&#13;
&#13;
           the position that was put to you in the documents is based&#13;
&#13;
           in some cases on preliminary information that we need to&#13;
&#13;
           confirm, and that this would be done through the mission in&#13;
&#13;
           August where we would have Bank staff in liaison with the&#13;
&#13;
           IMF mission working together and confirming whether or not&#13;
&#13;
           (a) the targets that have been agreed in the revised IMF&#13;
&#13;
           program have been met, whether the prospects continue to be&#13;
&#13;
           good that progress would be made in the economic program&#13;
&#13;
           and, therefore, in a certain sense, whether the prospects&#13;
&#13;
           are there that we will have an effective program.&#13;
&#13;
                      On this front, we believe that there may be&#13;
&#13;
           different perception between us and the bilaterals, in a&#13;
&#13;
           certain sense, but we think that, on the basis of the&#13;
&#13;
           information that we have, on the basis of the analysis that&#13;
&#13;
           the two institutions have, we think progress has been made&#13;
&#13;
           in recent months and that the prospects remain good, if&#13;
&#13;
           financing is available, to maintain this progress in the&#13;
&#13;
           program.&#13;
&#13;
                      The funds would not be released unless, in fact,&#13;

                                   507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           management is satisfied that these prospects remain viable.&#13;
&#13;
                     The second driver which is the governance issues,&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, what we are, in effect, saying is that some of&#13;
&#13;
           the elements that are in that basket are beyond the reach of&#13;
&#13;
           Bank staff to assess, are beyond the reach of the mandate&#13;
&#13;
           that we have to take into account.      That is why we have not&#13;
&#13;
           introduced that particular element in the condition of&#13;
&#13;
           effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                     At the same time, we are very aware that these&#13;
&#13;
           issues need to be dealt with, which is why we took Mr.&#13;
&#13;
           Good's suggestion from the discussion during the CAS that we&#13;
&#13;
           see whether there are ways in which we might encourage the&#13;
&#13;
           government and the bilaterals to get together to discuss the&#13;
&#13;
           specifics surrounding these governance issues.&#13;
&#13;
                     We have been careful to limit ourselves and our&#13;
&#13;
           involvement to the economic governance dimension of that&#13;
&#13;
           discussion and not the political.&#13;
&#13;
                     So, to summarize then, Mr. Chairman, I would say&#13;
&#13;
           that there may well be different perceptions by the&#13;
&#13;
           bilaterals on the recent economic progress made from that of&#13;
&#13;
           the Bank staff and the Fund staff.      But we think on the&#13;
&#13;
           basis of the information that we have, that the position we&#13;
&#13;
           have taken is in fact a sound position.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                      On the issue of governance, as I said, we can&#13;
&#13;
           facilitate a discussion but I don't think we could&#13;
&#13;
           realistically link it as an element of the condition of&#13;
&#13;
           effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                      Let's move on and hear five or six more views&#13;
&#13;
           here.&#13;
&#13;
                      Huw again.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. EVANS:    Sorry, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                      I thought when you introduced the speakers, you&#13;
&#13;
           said we were going to hear something more about the finance&#13;
&#13;
           of this program.   We have heard something about the attitude&#13;
&#13;
           of the Bank towards governance issues, but I have not heard&#13;
&#13;
           any more statements about the financeability of this&#13;
&#13;
           program.   It would be helpful to hear a bit more about that&#13;
&#13;
           either from the Bank staff or perhaps from the Fund at this&#13;
&#13;
           stage.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. MADAVO:   Mr. Chairman, I think we can make two&#13;
&#13;
           points on that and I will call on my colleague, John Todd,&#13;
&#13;
           to perhaps provide some numbers about the financing&#13;
&#13;
           requirements particularly over the next period ahead, in the&#13;
&#13;
           third quarter.&#13;
&#13;
                      But I want to preface that by saying again that we&#13;

                                    507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

  nm                                                                        34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         don't think this program can be financed in the medium term&#13;
&#13;
         for Zambia if all the players do not come around the table.&#13;
&#13;
                   That is why it is so very important that there be&#13;
&#13;
         a dialogue between the government and the bilaterals leading&#13;
&#13;
         at an early point to their coming back to the table.        That&#13;
&#13;
         will give us the basis on which we can say in the medium-&#13;
&#13;
         term the program can be, in fact, financed.&#13;
&#13;
                   Now there is the issue of whether the requirements&#13;
&#13;
         over the next few months, which would enable the government&#13;
&#13;
         to continue to make their progress, that we and the Fund&#13;
&#13;
         would expect to see if they keep their commitments, and&#13;
&#13;
         perhaps my colleague would lay out the requirements in terms&#13;
&#13;
         of the numbers.&#13;
&#13;
                   MR. TODD:   Let me just start by saying that I&#13;
&#13;
         agree with Mr. Good that there is risk on both sides, and&#13;
&#13;
         none of the estimates that we have or the assessments that&#13;
&#13;
         we make are certain, but this is our best judgment at the&#13;
&#13;
         time.&#13;
&#13;
                   On the annual side, I think the numbers that were&#13;
&#13;
         conveyed to the Fund Board remain a reasonably good estimate&#13;
&#13;
         for total need, which was the $263 million.        I think to that&#13;
&#13;
         one might need to add in the neighborhood of $20 million as&#13;
&#13;
         the net change for the year due to all of the copper and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           cobalt machinations.      It could be 30; it is in that range.&#13;
&#13;
                     Available assistance in the absence of any&#13;
&#13;
           additional assistance from bilaterals would be in the range&#13;
&#13;
           of $215 million, and that is the same number that had been&#13;
&#13;
           conveyed before.&#13;
&#13;
                     So, that represents the challenge and that&#13;
&#13;
           challenge would best be met by additional assistance.              It&#13;
&#13;
           would undoubtedly be met to some extent by compression of&#13;
&#13;
           the Zambia program as needed and appropriate and determined&#13;
&#13;
           through the August mission.&#13;
&#13;
                     The point I wanted to emphasize relates more to&#13;
&#13;
           the third quarter.     The number that we had given you before&#13;
&#13;
           is still the primary number, which is that there is $62 debt&#13;
&#13;
           service owed in the third quarter alone.              There is the added&#13;
&#13;
           liquidity problem that the fire in the smelter, of which&#13;
&#13;
           most of you are probably are aware, is probably going to&#13;
&#13;
           have a short-term impact of $10 million to $12 million.&#13;
&#13;
           This will probably be made up over the course of the year as&#13;
&#13;
           the backlogged copper is finally processed through the&#13;
&#13;
           smelter once it is back in operation, and I believe it is,&#13;
&#13;
           in fact, already beginning to be back in operation.              But&#13;
&#13;
           there is that short-term liquidity problem.&#13;
&#13;
                     Then the uncertainty of copper prices, which is in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                          the neighborhood of $5.00 per month per dyne (Phonetic), and&#13;
&#13;
                          we are running about 10 cents to 12 cents below the previous&#13;
&#13;
                          projections we had made for the year on copper prices, only&#13;
&#13;
                          somewhat offset by the good news on cobalt.&#13;
&#13;
                                    So, we cannot prove that everything comes unstuck,&#13;
&#13;
                          but clearly if all of the assistance, including the&#13;
&#13;
                          multilateral assistance, lies behind the bilateral&#13;
&#13;
                          assistance, there is a very substantial risk that the&#13;
&#13;
                          program would come unstuck over even the course of the next&#13;
&#13;
                          months.&#13;

&#13;
                          fairly well resumed the position this constituency is&#13;
&#13;
                          taking.   I may add one or two more points.&#13;
&#13;
                                    The first is the historic perspective.     Those who&#13;
&#13;
                          have participated in the discussion a month or two months&#13;
&#13;
                          ago in the country assistance strategy review on Zambia will&#13;
&#13;
                          certainly confirm that the Bank and particularly the Board&#13;
&#13;
                          in the last fifteen years has always, without exception,&#13;
&#13;
                          been over optimistic about the program and the performance.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                   If we always are speaking about taking the lessons&#13;
&#13;
         from the past, I think we should bear that in mind.&#13;
&#13;
                   The second, also as a matter of fact,       lesson we&#13;
&#13;
         have drawn time and again in CODE is what has been said by&#13;
&#13;
         the predecessors here around the table.        When a program is&#13;
&#13;
         not fully financed, whatever the reason is, be it now&#13;
&#13;
         politically, be it now economically, be it internal,&#13;
&#13;
         external economic factors, the program, which is financed&#13;
&#13;
         partially by the Bank will in no likelihood fail and, at the&#13;
&#13;
         same time, our President time and again here in your chair,&#13;
&#13;
         Sven, tells us the Bank has to increase its performance.&#13;
&#13;
                   We all agree with that.      But we, the Executive&#13;
&#13;
         Directors, are the first responsible that the Bank does not&#13;
&#13;
         perform well.   It is not management, but it is the Board&#13;
&#13;
         which gives it agreement to such kind of credits where we&#13;
&#13;
         know in advance that the likelihood that it will fail is&#13;
&#13;
         fairly substantive.&#13;
&#13;
                   That is the reason I would also like to be&#13;
&#13;
         recorded as abstaining.&#13;
&#13;
                   Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                    This is, in fact, a difficult situation and it is&#13;
&#13;
         not the first time that this Board has confronted difficult&#13;
&#13;
         options in the Zambia case.       I think our deliberations&#13;
&#13;
          today, as we already said during the CAS discussion, have&#13;
&#13;
         been made more difficult for the lack of a clear and&#13;
&#13;
          transparent dialogue between management and the Board and&#13;
&#13;
          the bilaterals.&#13;
&#13;
                    We know that the options are limited if one can&#13;
&#13;
         even put it in the plural, but a cooperative approach would&#13;
&#13;
          have been preferable than the approach chosen by management&#13;
&#13;
          in this case.&#13;
&#13;
                    The donor community has supported strongly Zambia&#13;
&#13;
          and the economic program.     That support is failing for&#13;
&#13;
          reasons of doubts on the economic performance and on the&#13;
&#13;
         political commitment towards the core objectives of the&#13;
&#13;
         program.&#13;
&#13;
                    As it has been said by several speakers, both&#13;
&#13;
          staff and my colleagues, donor support is crucial.      We are&#13;
&#13;
         not sure when and if it is going to be available.&#13;
&#13;
                    We are also concerned with the approach taken in&#13;
&#13;
         using IDA money as a breathing space or as others said&#13;
&#13;
         bridging nowhere.    We are seriously concerned with that.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         bilateral agencies, we share the concerns expressed by&#13;
&#13;
         previous speakers of the current situation.           We would have&#13;
&#13;
         preferred to consider this credit after being able to&#13;
&#13;
         benefit from the outcome of the mission.&#13;
&#13;
                   We also attach considerable importance to the main&#13;
&#13;
         objectives of the mission, as Huw Evans reminded us, based&#13;
&#13;
         on Mr. Ouattara's memo.&#13;
&#13;
                   We recognize the late movement done by introducing&#13;
&#13;
         an additional condition of effectiveness, which, as many&#13;
&#13;
         others said, goes in the right direction, but we wish it had&#13;
&#13;
         gone further in spelling out all the elements that make&#13;
&#13;
         possible to fill that IDA money is going in support of a&#13;
&#13;
         sustainable and viable program.&#13;
&#13;
                   We fully support the thorough statement circulated&#13;
&#13;
         by Arnaud Chneiweiss on the issues that remain for us.           We&#13;
&#13;
         are also very reluctant to see IDA money being disbursed for&#13;
&#13;
         this adjustment credit if the prospects for resuming funding&#13;
&#13;
         under the ESAF are not confirmed.&#13;
&#13;
                   Our constituency is not involved in bilateral&#13;
&#13;
         support to Zambia.     So, we cannot add any words if it is&#13;
&#13;
         coming from our side; no.       We are interested to see how our&#13;
&#13;
         donors will, in fact, assess their own views of the&#13;
&#13;
         political and economic situation.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                     So, somehow I share most of what has been said by&#13;
&#13;
           previous speakers, but I take a different view regarding the&#13;
&#13;
           issue of who is responsible for assessing the fulfillment of&#13;
&#13;
           effectiveness conditions.      I agree with Eveline of creating&#13;
&#13;
           a precedent for which we are not in favor.&#13;
&#13;
                     We consider that management has the responsibility&#13;
&#13;
           of assessing progress as it has been stated today by this&#13;
&#13;
           Board, taking into account the concerns, as they have been&#13;
&#13;
           expressed, as the guidance for management's judgment of&#13;
&#13;
           conditions of effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                     We entrust management with such responsibility,&#13;
&#13;
           and we think that this Board has been clear during our CAS&#13;
&#13;
           discussion and today of what our concerns are.       Our&#13;
&#13;
           concerns, and in particular my constituency's concerns, are&#13;
&#13;
           on economic performance and commitment to pursue the&#13;
&#13;
           economic program.&#13;
&#13;
                     We expect in view of this debate and this&#13;
&#13;
           divergence of views or different perceptions, as some others&#13;
&#13;
           have called it, that in this case management will take an&#13;
&#13;
           in-depth and detailed approach in reporting to the Board&#13;
&#13;
           when and what its assessment is of the conditions of&#13;
&#13;
           effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                     So basically, what I would like to state 1s that,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         although we share all the concerns, we feel that for reasons&#13;
&#13;
         that we may not fully understand, management decides that it&#13;
&#13;
         is in a bad situation, it is better to bring this credit to&#13;
&#13;
         the Board now in order not to make the situation worse that&#13;
&#13;
         we are willing to support this credit and the conditions&#13;
&#13;
         that I have expressed which put on management a stronger and&#13;
&#13;
         heavier responsibility in assessing performance after the&#13;
&#13;
         August mission and share with us a very detailed report on&#13;
&#13;
         meeting those conditions.&#13;
&#13;
                   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                   MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                   These were very helpful suggestions and the rest&#13;
&#13;
         of you may want to comment on those too.&#13;

                   Mr. Tamaki, please.&#13;
&#13;
                   MR. TAMAKI:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                   It is of great concern for us if we should support&#13;
&#13;
         Zambia at this time.    As the alternative plan suggested by&#13;
&#13;
         the management could be seen as a progress to me, my&#13;
&#13;
         reasoning is quite similar to Helena and Arnaud.&#13;
&#13;
                   The crucial point in undertaking this plan is&#13;
&#13;
         obviously the condition of effectiveness, namely the content&#13;
&#13;
         of the condition and the method of evaluating its success.&#13;
&#13;
                   The conditions should not be too rigid so as not&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  nm                                                                      42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         to encourage the Zambian Government to proceed with the&#13;
&#13;
         reform process.   However, I agree with the French statement&#13;
&#13;
         on its macroeconomic framework that IDA money should not be&#13;
&#13;
         disbursed if no prospects are foreseen for the Fund to&#13;
&#13;
         resume its ESAF program disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
                   The conditions should also be concrete so that it&#13;
&#13;
         will be obvious for all of us if Zambia has met the&#13;
&#13;
         conditions or not.     As long the conditions are concrete, I&#13;
&#13;
         believe that another formal procedure by the Board would be&#13;
&#13;
         unnecessary.&#13;
&#13;
                   Besides, considering the importance of the timing&#13;
&#13;
         of this assistance, it would be better to give the&#13;
&#13;
         responsibility to the management for making assessment of&#13;
&#13;
         compliance with the condition of effectiveness.       In doing&#13;
&#13;
         that, the management should take the concerns expressed at&#13;
&#13;
         the Board into full consideration.&#13;
&#13;
                   So, my conclusion is that I could accept the&#13;
&#13;
         alternative with a strong request for the management to keep&#13;
&#13;
         a very close eye on the reform process in Zambia, to&#13;
&#13;
         evaluate its success carefully and to report it back to the&#13;
&#13;
         Board appropriately.&#13;

&#13;
                     Mr. Chairman, none of the countries that I&#13;
&#13;
           represent runs a bilateral agency.      So, I have to rely on&#13;
&#13;
           the information provided by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                     I am certain that the Bank tends to have&#13;
&#13;
           information of very good quality.      I know the involvement of&#13;
&#13;
           the Bank in countries' realities based on the experience I&#13;
&#13;
           have with the countries I represent, and I tend to believe&#13;
&#13;
           that the political judgment that the Bank makes on realities&#13;
&#13;
           usually works well.&#13;
&#13;
                     No doubt about the fact that this is a very&#13;
&#13;
           ambitious loan that one disbursement upfront, based on&#13;
&#13;
           general conditionality, and additional conditionalities very&#13;
&#13;
           strong, touching macro performance, budget priorities, land&#13;
&#13;
           reform, a new Labor Act, a number of things.&#13;
&#13;
                     I tend to believe that the Bank has in its&#13;
&#13;
           relations, regular relations with a country like Zambia, the&#13;
&#13;
           obligation to be responsive at a critical moment.        I tend to&#13;
&#13;
           believe that, given the commitments accepted by the&#13;
&#13;
           Government of Zambia in the context of the whole loan           I&#13;
&#13;
           am not talking only about the macro performance -- there is&#13;

                                   507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           a gain in going ahead with the loan and getting the&#13;
&#13;
           government engaged with the measures that are foreseen here.&#13;
&#13;
                     We tend to judge the Bank operation based on the&#13;
&#13;
           quality of the project on the country commitments and on not&#13;
&#13;
           on elements that are not included in the project or do not&#13;
&#13;
           belong to the economic reality of the country.&#13;
&#13;
                     So, if one looks at this project, it is very&#13;
&#13;
           difficult to object to it, given the very strong commitments&#13;
&#13;
           that are accepted by the Government of Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
                     So, for this reason,    I am very much supportive of&#13;
&#13;
           this operation.   If the dialogue were lost with other&#13;
&#13;
           international financial institutions, the Fund, for example,&#13;
&#13;
           we would have a reason to stop.      But the dialogue is going&#13;
&#13;
           on, and, in this case, I tend to believe, based on the&#13;
&#13;
           information provided, that it would be a mistake for the&#13;
&#13;
           Bank not to be supportive.&#13;
&#13;
                     I think that the challenge now is to help the&#13;
&#13;
           Government of Zambia to work with all the elements that are&#13;
&#13;
           included in this project and then assist them in making it&#13;
&#13;
           possible the release of the additional tranche.&#13;

                     Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
                     MR. CHNEIWEISS:     Thank you, Sven.&#13;
&#13;
                     It will not be a surprise if I tell you that I&#13;
&#13;
           agree with Helena and Rintaro.     I would have preferred to&#13;
&#13;
           have a discussion and the approval of this credit early in&#13;
&#13;
           September rather than today.     I think I understand the&#13;
&#13;
           reasons why management is proposing the approval of this&#13;
&#13;
           credit today.   I am still a little bit unconvinced.&#13;
&#13;
                     If you could stress one more time the rationale&#13;
&#13;
           for going ahead so quickly,    I would appreciate it.   But, to&#13;
&#13;
           a certain extent, I admit that it is your judgment and we&#13;
&#13;
           have to trust you on that.&#13;
&#13;
                     I appreciate the fact that you have added one&#13;
&#13;
           condition of effectiveness, and it is your responsibility,&#13;
&#13;
           the responsibility of management to exert your judgment&#13;
&#13;
           whether or not this condition of effectiveness will be met.&#13;
&#13;
           But I would really urge caution and I request management to&#13;
&#13;
           take a very prudent conservative approach to see whether or&#13;
&#13;
           not conditions have been met on the macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
           stabilization program.&#13;
&#13;
                      I appreciate that Callisto reemphasized the fact&#13;
&#13;
           that we will look both at the targets, whether or not they&#13;
&#13;
           have been met in the past, and also at the prospects for the&#13;
&#13;
           future.   If there is no prospect for the IMF to conclude a&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           program, if there is no prospect for the IMF to resume its&#13;
&#13;
           disbursements under the ESAF program, I don't think we&#13;
&#13;
           should go ahead disbursing an IDA credit.           It would be a&#13;
&#13;
           waste of IDA money.&#13;
&#13;
                     At this time, this credit has become a very&#13;
&#13;
           sensitive issue.   All of our capitals are aware of this&#13;
&#13;
           credit now, even those who don't care too much about Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
           I agree with Helena that you have special responsibility in&#13;
&#13;
           exerting your judgment in this case.&#13;
&#13;
                     If we give the feeling over the next few months to&#13;
&#13;
           our capitals that in this case IDA money has been wasted, it&#13;
&#13;
           would have disastrous consequences for IDA support generally&#13;
&#13;
           speaking, more than Zambia is at stake with this credit.&#13;
&#13;
                     So, I really urge you to exert your judgment in a&#13;
&#13;
           very prudent way, and to provide us a detailed progress&#13;
&#13;
           report after exerting your judgment.&#13;
&#13;
                     Thank you.&#13;

                     Mr. Alyahya, please.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. ALYAHYA:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     At this stage of the discussion, I will be brief.&#13;
&#13;
           I have two comments.&#13;
&#13;
                     First, I have noted management's arguments for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                                    507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                                  Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                                       (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  nm                                                                          47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           going ahead at this time with this credit.         So, I support&#13;
&#13;
           it, as revised, with the additional condition of&#13;
&#13;
           effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                     There are no doubt risks to going ahead, but there&#13;
&#13;
           are in my view even greater risks in the kind of signal that&#13;
&#13;
           inaction would send.&#13;
&#13;
                     Second and for the record, like Eveline Herfkens,&#13;
&#13;
           I retain a sense of unease about the way this whole issue&#13;
&#13;
           has been handled procedurally and otherwise.         I think there&#13;
&#13;
           could be implications which go beyond the specifics of&#13;
&#13;
           Zambia, including the potential for undermining the&#13;
&#13;
           cooperative nature of this very Board.        Perhaps we should&#13;
&#13;
           all reflect on this and consider how we can avoid such&#13;
&#13;
           situations in the future.&#13;
&#13;
                     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Clark, please.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. CLARK:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     There is very little we can add to the debate at&#13;
&#13;
           this stage in the proceedings.     However, we are disappointed&#13;
&#13;
           that management has chosen not to follow the directions&#13;
&#13;
           suggested by Mr. Evans, Mr. Good and Ms. Piercy, which we&#13;
&#13;
           would like emphasize should not be seen as a rejection of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         the credit.&#13;
&#13;
                   The arguments advanced by those Chairs we saw as&#13;
&#13;
         compelling, and particularly for an assessment of the Board&#13;
&#13;
         following the Bank staff mission before any decision is made&#13;
&#13;
         on this ESAC.   The current attitude, to highlight one thing,&#13;
&#13;
         of major donors whose support is vital is of great concern&#13;
&#13;
         to us.&#13;
&#13;
                   Mr. Good's comment on the desirability of a&#13;
&#13;
         coordinated approach is particularly pertinent and really&#13;
&#13;
         supported by Mr. Madavo's own comment that without the other&#13;
&#13;
         bilaterals the financing plan will not be fulfilled.&#13;
&#13;
                   In this light, Mr. Chairman, and to keep it short,&#13;
&#13;
         we would also like to be recorded as abstaining.&#13;
&#13;
                   MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                   Mr. Al-Saad, please.&#13;
&#13;
                   MR. AL-SAAD:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                   Our position was clearly stated in our statement&#13;
&#13;
         previously distributed, that we endorse the proposed credit.&#13;
&#13;
         We think approval of such credit should give a strong signal&#13;
&#13;
         of Bank continued commitment for the reform effort of&#13;
&#13;
         Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
                   On the question of timing, I tend to disagree with&#13;
&#13;
         some of our colleagues.     The timing we believe is right to&#13;

&#13;
                        MR. GALINDEZ:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                        I would like to extend our support to this&#13;
&#13;
           operation.     I would also like to point out that in FY96&#13;
&#13;
           Zambia had negative net transfers with the IBRD in the&#13;
&#13;
           amount of $46 million.        This is an IDA country transfer to&#13;
&#13;
           IBRD in one fiscal year, and this is something to be taken&#13;
&#13;
           into account, particularly in view of the $450 million which&#13;
&#13;
           will be needed in 1996 as balance of payments assistance.&#13;
&#13;
                        We also endorse Mr. Tamaki's suggestion that&#13;
&#13;
           management keeps the responsibility to monitor future&#13;
&#13;
           developments in Zambia and report it to the Board in the&#13;
&#13;
           best possible way.&#13;
&#13;
                        As it was said by other speakers, a dialogue is&#13;
&#13;
           going on and this is the right time for the Bank to go ahead&#13;
&#13;
           in our opinion and take what we call, and everybody calls, a&#13;
&#13;
           calculated risk.&#13;

                        Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. RILL:    Picking up on the calculated risk, I am&#13;
&#13;
           not so sure whether we really are calculating our risks&#13;
&#13;
           here, but I am ready to go forward, despite some uneasiness&#13;
&#13;
           with taking that risk.&#13;
&#13;
                     Like Mr. Chneiweiss, Ms. Cordeiro, Mr. Tamaki and&#13;
&#13;
           others, I think the responsibility should remain with&#13;
&#13;
           management as appropriate for making the final judgments&#13;
&#13;
           before disbursement and effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                     But picking up on Mr. Gerber's comment that we are&#13;
&#13;
           responsible for keeping up the quality of our work here, I&#13;
&#13;
           would like to strongly remind management and staff that&#13;
&#13;
           there may come a time when we will discuss in CODE a country&#13;
&#13;
           assistance review for Zambia and then you had better be&#13;
&#13;
           prepared to explain what went wrong afterwards if something&#13;
&#13;
           goes wrong.&#13;
&#13;
                     Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
                     Countries do get into difficulties and yet, like&#13;
&#13;
           Zambia, they demonstrate a resolve that they can move&#13;
&#13;
           towards reform.   This country has demonstrated that.       Even&#13;
&#13;
           in its efforts to privatize, it has done that.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                     Its shortcoming perhaps has been aggravated by the&#13;
&#13;
           price of its exports not being competitive.        Are we going to&#13;
&#13;
           penalize them for that?     If you are going to wait for the&#13;
&#13;
           Bank and Fund mission to go and to certify, what are these&#13;
&#13;
           six weeks going to produce really?&#13;
&#13;
                     On the other hand, if you deny the credit at this&#13;
&#13;
           time, loaded as it is with the conditions of effectiveness&#13;

           disincentives and perhaps eroding confidence.&#13;
&#13;
                     Yes, it is absolutely desirable that the donors&#13;
&#13;
           move along with the Bank.    But the Bank is the senior&#13;
&#13;
           partner in this partnership of the donors and the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
           it is a more discerning partner.      It is a partner that sees&#13;
&#13;
           that these risks are tenable.&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Chairman, therefore, we very much support the&#13;
&#13;
           time and the content of this project.&#13;

                     Thank you.&#13;

           after you have summed up or whatever.&#13;

                     MR. SANDSTROM:     You really want to be the last&#13;

&#13;
                     MR. SANDSTROM:        Callisto, do you want to say a few&#13;
&#13;
           words and then I will try to wrap it up?&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. MADAVO:     Mr. Chairman&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. SANDSTROM:       Asbjoern, do you want to come in&#13;
&#13;
           first?&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. LOEVBRAEK:        Yes, I think so, just to clarify&#13;
&#13;
           on the procedural issues.        I appreciate the explanations&#13;
&#13;
           that were given from staff and also the comments around this&#13;
&#13;
           table.   In fact,   I share those of you who have said that it&#13;
&#13;
           would, in principle, very unfortunate that the Board in a&#13;
&#13;
           sense had a second round and discussed conditions of&#13;
&#13;
           effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                      I would have been willing to make an exception in&#13;
&#13;
           this rather exceptional case, but I just note that the road&#13;
&#13;
           that was suggested by Huw Evans and others is not possible.&#13;
&#13;
           That makes my decision more easy, which is abstention.&#13;
&#13;
                      Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. SANDSTROM:       Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                      Callisto, please.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. MADAVO:    Let me just make a few points.&#13;
&#13;
                      Obviously, as is obvious from the discussion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                                     507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                                   Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                                       (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  nm                                                                        53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           around the table, Mr. Chairman, this is not an easy case.&#13;
&#13;
           It is a difficult case and we are taking some risks.        We&#13;
&#13;
           wanted to share honestly some of these points with the&#13;
&#13;
           Board.&#13;
&#13;
                        I think a second observation I would make is that&#13;
&#13;
           we listened very carefully and we agree that the assessment&#13;
&#13;
           of whether or not the condition of effectiveness has been&#13;
&#13;
           met should not be just a mechanical one; that we really&#13;
&#13;
           should exercise judgment not just about numbers but about&#13;
&#13;
           prospects.&#13;
&#13;
                        So, I just wanted to be responsive to the Board on&#13;
&#13;
           that particular point.&#13;
&#13;
                        My third observation, Mr. Chairman, is we had&#13;
&#13;
           wanted to proceed in this way so that we could remain&#13;
&#13;
           relevant in the question of trying to encourage a&#13;
&#13;
           cooperative approach.      We didn't see, in fact, this way of&#13;
&#13;
           proceeding, as the Bank detaching from the partnership.&#13;
&#13;
                        It was really to give us influence within the&#13;
&#13;
           partnership, the ability to play this role or bring in the&#13;
&#13;
           government to the table, bringing the bilaterals to the&#13;
&#13;
           table with some credibility.        We could manage the risks and&#13;
&#13;
           proceed prudently.&#13;
&#13;
                        So, I just wanted to make those observations, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                                      507 c Street, N.E.&#13;
                                    Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  nm                                                                          54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                       This is clearly a very difficult case.      As we now&#13;
&#13;
           have heard, there are very different perspectives on the&#13;
&#13;
           economic and political governance and, in particular, on the&#13;
&#13;
           links between these two, which makes it very difficult for&#13;
&#13;
           the Bank and its management.&#13;
&#13;
                       We also have the difficult judgment on the funding&#13;
&#13;
           prospects where the IDA credit clearly is a linchpin, and&#13;
&#13;
           the way we go on this will affect the flow of other&#13;
&#13;
           resources to at least some extent.        There may be different&#13;
&#13;
           judgments on exactly the extent on which it has an impact,&#13;
&#13;
           but certainly it will have an impact.&#13;
&#13;
                       My suggestion is that we proceed, but that we&#13;
&#13;
           follow up on the many,    I think, very constructive&#13;
&#13;
           suggestions that have been made here and, in particular,&#13;
&#13;
           that we take guidance from this discussion when we assess&#13;
&#13;
           the situation in August and when we assess the satisfaction&#13;
&#13;
           of the conditions of effectiveness, and that we then provide&#13;
&#13;
           a full report to you.&#13;
&#13;
                       But in doing that, we follow the established&#13;
&#13;
           procedures.    So, if we are fully satisfied that the&#13;
&#13;
           conditions have been met with the guidance we have received&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           today, we will release the tranche at the same time.&#13;
&#13;
                        However, if there are doubts, if the conditions&#13;
&#13;
           with your guidance today has not been fully met, we will&#13;
&#13;
           come back to you.        So, we will follow the normal procedures&#13;
&#13;
           and we will try to do this to the best of our ability.&#13;
&#13;
                        With that, Leonard, do you want to come in before&#13;
&#13;
           I say that it has been approved?&#13;
&#13;
                        All right.      Well, the credit is approved on the&#13;
&#13;
           terms proposed with Mr. Crowe opposed, or not it is Ms.&#13;
&#13;
           Piercy, I assume, and with the following abstaining:          Mr.&#13;
&#13;
           Evans, Mr. Loevbraek, Mr. Good, Mr. Schaffer, Mr. Gerber and&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Clark.&#13;
&#13;
                        Did I get that right?        No changes?&#13;
&#13;
                        [No response. ]&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. SANDSTROM:       All right.&#13;
&#13;
                        Leonard.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. MSEKA:      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                        Although it is not customary that an Executive&#13;
&#13;
           Director representing the country whose operation is being&#13;
&#13;
           discussed takes the floor,         I feel I should say a few words,&#13;
&#13;
           particularly in view of the controversy that has surrounded&#13;
&#13;
           this particular operation.&#13;
&#13;
                        First of all, I would like on behalf of my Zambian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  nm                                                                             56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           authorities to thank the Board and particularly those who&#13;
&#13;
           have openly supported this operation for approving this&#13;
&#13;
           adjustment credit.&#13;
&#13;
                        In particular, I would also like to thank Callisto&#13;
&#13;
           Madavo and the entire Zambian country team, led by Phyllis&#13;
&#13;
           Pomerantz, for working so tirelessly on this operation.              We&#13;
&#13;
           commend them highly for their mature judgment in the case of&#13;
&#13;
           Zambia and their dedication to the cause of development.&#13;
&#13;
                       Second, Mr. Chairman, I wish to register a concern&#13;
&#13;
           and to submit a request.&#13;
&#13;
                       As I noted almost two weeks when we discussed the&#13;
&#13;
           CAS, what has happened to Zambia in the course of the last&#13;
&#13;
           two weeks is the fourth time it has happened in our&#13;
&#13;
           constituency to varying degrees during the past eighteen&#13;
&#13;
           months.&#13;
&#13;
                       We find this totally inequitable.         It is an open&#13;
&#13;
           secret that governance issues are increasingly being&#13;
&#13;
           camouflaged with economic arguments.          In this respect,   I&#13;
&#13;
           wish to commend Eveline Herfkens for her statement made&#13;
&#13;
           earlier today.&#13;
&#13;
                       Yet, governance issues, or shall I say non-&#13;
&#13;
           economic issues, are not peculiar to Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
&#13;
           only.     Examples can be found in other regions as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                                      507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                                    Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  nm                                                                       57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     It is not that we do not wish to uphold democratic&#13;
&#13;
           principles; we do.     And evidence across Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
&#13;
           clearly demonstrates our people's commitment to democracy,&#13;
&#13;
           the rule of law and economic reforms.&#13;
&#13;
                     What we find intriguing and unacceptable is that,&#13;
&#13;
           when it comes to non-economic issues, African countries are&#13;
&#13;
           treated differently and are held to a different standard by&#13;
&#13;
           this Board from countries in other regions, even where the&#13;
&#13;
           record of economic reform and the implementation is clearly&#13;
&#13;
           not satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
                     If it is necessary that we should keep repeating&#13;
&#13;
           this observation every time it happens like a broken record,&#13;
&#13;
           we shall do so until we are heard.&#13;
&#13;
                     However, we think this is not necessary if the&#13;
&#13;
           Board is willing to discuss this issue openly.&#13;
&#13;
                     Therefore, I should like, Mr. Chairman, to submit&#13;
&#13;
           a request that CODE and/or OED examine this issue&#13;
&#13;
           critically.   Our countries are members of these institutions&#13;
&#13;
           and they, like other members, deserve all the deference from&#13;
&#13;
           the institutions as stipulated in the Articles of Agreement;&#13;
&#13;
           thus, my request.&#13;
&#13;
                     Once again, I wish to thank the Board for&#13;
&#13;
           approving the credit.&#13;
