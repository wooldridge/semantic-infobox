1. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
A. AGRICULTURE IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY&#13;
1.1   Throughout the postwar period and until the 1980s, the Brazilian economy grew at&#13;
an average annual rate of 90/o. Over the same period, the agricultural sector, although&#13;
achieving an average annual growth rate of about 4%, fell behind the outputs of both the&#13;
industrial and service sectors which increased at much faster rates. As a result, from 1950&#13;
to 1980, agriculture's share of total GDP declined from 25% to 10%. Agricultural&#13;
development prior to 1980 was led by the growth of non-traditional exports (mainly&#13;
soybean and citrus). Production increases came almost entirely from expansion into new&#13;
lands, although yield increases over the period were also significant. Growth was&#13;
particularly dynamic in the frontier states of the Center-West (Goias and Mato Grosso do&#13;
Sul) and parts of Minas Gerais.&#13;
1.2  In the early 1980s the economy slowed down, reflecting declining industrial&#13;
production and relative stagnation in agriculture. Expansion of the agricultural frontier&#13;
came to a virtual halt with the exception of certain areas in the North. Between 1980 and&#13;
1986, the total crop area grew at only 1.7% per year, and the output of many basic food&#13;
crops remained constant or rose only moderately (as in 1984 and 1985). Agricultural&#13;
export earnings showed virtually no growth, except for 1984 when coffee and&#13;
concentrated citrus exports were aided by favorable price movements.&#13;
1.3   From 1986 to 1991, agricultural growth rebounded strongly, but the sources of&#13;
growth appeared to be changing. With the recent introduction of new varieties made&#13;
possible by technological advances in agricultural research, and increased investment in&#13;
irrigation in some areas, yields of traditional export crops (cotton, tobacco and coffee) and&#13;
many food crops (rice and wheat) have increased significantly. Expansion of the&#13;
agricultural frontier has been giving way to intensification of production on existing farm&#13;
land. Between 1992 and 1996, the most successful crops have been sugarcane, citrus and&#13;
soybeans, while the production of cotton, rice, beans, maize, sorghum and coffee has&#13;
declined. The central and western states of the country (Goias and Mato Grosso do Sul)&#13;
continued to experience the strongest growth in the agricultural sector. By 1996, the&#13;
agricultural sector generated 23% of the total employment of the country and accounted&#13;
for about 0-11% of GDP.&#13;
B. AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES&#13;
1.4   Government policies have had an important impact on the performance of&#13;
agriculture. Probably the most important action in this regard was Brazil's decision in the&#13;
postwar era to embark on an industrialization strategy based on import substitution. This&#13;
strategy was pursued through a variety of measures, including an overvalued currency,&#13;
restrictive trade policies and, from time to time, outright bans and quotas on agricultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
exports. The effect was implicitly to tax agriculture. But this era of massive government&#13;
intervention in agriculture is now over. The Government-initiated reforms in the late&#13;
1980s are being strengthened and extended by the present administration. The Bank has&#13;
supported these reforms in two ways. First, through its lending program, the Bank is&#13;
supporting the development of more efficient and modern systems of agricultural delivery&#13;
services with greater beneficiary and private sector participation, enhanced by privatization&#13;
and decentralization efforts. Second, the Bank has maintained an intensive policy dialogue&#13;
with policy-makers, academics and the private sector to extend the partial reforms in the&#13;
sector and prevent policy reversals.&#13;
1.5   While the Government policy agenda during the early 1990s continues to be&#13;
dominated by macroeconomic stabilization concerns, policies with respect to agriculture,&#13;
rural poverty and the environment have been emphasized in recent years.  The&#13;
Government assigns high priority to protecting the environment, having become&#13;
increasingly aware of the effect that some agricultural policies were having on the&#13;
environment. In addition, farmers, faced with the increasing need to take advantage of the&#13;
opportunities created by the MERCOSUL, have begun to seek more cost-effective and&#13;
environmentally benign technologies and to intensify the use of existing farm land and&#13;
rural infrastructure. This trend is already evident in the country's major agricultural areas&#13;
in the South and the Southeast. There is growing interest in irrigation, soil conservation,&#13;
environmental protection, livestock disease control, more efficient marketing and storage,&#13;
and more widespread application of the results of agricultural research. The increasing&#13;
exposure of the agricultural sector to more open markets, combined on the one hand with&#13;
Government initiatives to withdraw various fiscal incentives that encouraged expansion&#13;
into areas less suitable from an agro-ecological standpoint, and on the other declining&#13;
productivity due to widespread soil erosion, have created an urgent need for the sector to&#13;
increase its efficiency by developing more land-intensive and environmentally benign&#13;
production methods.&#13;
C. EXPERIENCE WIfH PAST BANK LENDING&#13;
1.6   The Bank has been involved in improved natural resources management and&#13;
micro-watershed development projects in southern Brazil since 1989, when it approved&#13;
the Parana Land Management I Project (Loan 3018-BR for US$63.0 million). In July&#13;
1991, the Bank approved the second project in the neighboring state of Santa Catarina,&#13;
the Land Management II Project (Loan 3160-BR for US$33.0).  These projects,&#13;
implemented with the full participation of local farmers--organized around&#13;
microcatchments--and with active participation of municipal governments and the private&#13;
sector, validated the microcatchment as an effective unit for planning and implementing&#13;
improved natural resource management activities. They have served as excellent models&#13;
for projects in different parts of Latin America and Africa, and for two additional projects&#13;
approved by the Bank in Brazil in recent years, the Rural Poverty Alleviation and Natural&#13;
Resources Management Project for the State of Parana (Loan 4060-BR for US$175.0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
million) approved on June 27, 1996, and the Natural Resources Management and Rural&#13;
Poverty Project for the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Loan 4148-BR for US $100.0&#13;
million) approved on July 11, 1997.&#13;
1.7   The Parana Land Management I Project, which closed in March 1997, has&#13;
effectively supported the State of Parana's effort to reduce soil degradation and erosion&#13;
and improve soil fertility, moisture and storage capacity by introducing innovative&#13;
technical approaches for economically viable investments in soil conservation and&#13;
management. As a result, production of major crops and income of farm households have&#13;
improved significantly.' More importantly, not only did participating farmers assimilate&#13;
and integrate the project's soil management techniques, but, through the demonstration&#13;
effect of these techniques, farmers in the region followed their example and demanded&#13;
other States to formulate similar projects. The Land Management I project has recently&#13;
been identified as one of the ten best projects currently financed by the Bank.&#13;
1.8   The implementation of the Land Management II Project, having suffered an initial&#13;
two-year setback due to delays in loan effectiveness, accelerated once the project concept&#13;
was disseminated at the local and microcatchment levels due to farmers' very positive&#13;
response to the project strategy. The Mid-Term evaluation carried out during 1996&#13;
confirmed that a number of project-promoted soil and water conservation practices are&#13;
substantially above appraisal estimates. Project achievements as of today have also&#13;
demonstrated that the natural resources depletion process resulting from inadequate land&#13;
husbandry could be reversed in a relatively short period of time. The project methodology&#13;
and its results have motivated the Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development to&#13;
elaborate a sustainable, multisectoral rural development strategy, with participation of&#13;
representatives of all sectors of society, at local, municipal and regional levels. However,&#13;
in spite of these advances, the project will need an additional year to make up for the start-&#13;
up delay so as to fully achieve its objectives and make full use of available financial&#13;
resources.&#13;
D. THE STATE OF SAo PAULO&#13;
1.9   Location and Natural Features. Sio Paulo, the second largest of the four states&#13;
of the Southeast Region, with a total area of 248,600 km2 (3% of Brazil), is bordered by&#13;
the States of Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul and Parana, and the Atlantic Ocean. Its&#13;
territory includes four main regions: (a) the coastal area, a narrow band of sedimentary&#13;
soils along the 600 kIm coast; (b) the planalto atldntico, an area with broken topography&#13;
and altitudes ranging from 300 m to 1,000 m; (c) the peripheral depression, a densely&#13;
Preliminary estimates on the microcatchment areas benefited under the project indicate productivity&#13;
increases ranging from 10 to 40%/o while the preliminary results on the 16 pilot microcatchment areas&#13;
monitored under the project indicate a reduction of about 500/. of the turbidity rate measured at the&#13;
microcatchment level over a 24-month period, and reduction of up to 50% in road maintenance cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
populated narrow strip of land between 500 m and 700 m in altitude, predominantly&#13;
industrial; and (d)the planalto ocidental (60% of the State's total area), the most&#13;
intensively cultivated area on sedimentary and sandstone-derived soils. Its location&#13;
between latitudes 190 and 250 south makes Sao Paulo suitable for both tropical and&#13;
temperate agriculture. Most annual rainfall, which ranges from 1,200 mm to 2,000 mm,&#13;
falls in summer, often in the form of intense storms. Medium fertility soils (such as&#13;
latosols, and podzols) represent 77% of the state's soils.&#13;
1.10 Economic and Social Conditions. Sao Paulo is Brazil's richest and most&#13;
populated state, currently with 35% of the national GDP and 22% of the total population.&#13;
Despite the state's huge industrial sector (45% of the national industrial output), which&#13;
makes it the nations economic powerhouse, agriculture remains important; it contributes&#13;
nearly 15% to national agricultural output (Annex A, Table A.1) and 4% to the state's&#13;
GDP, and generates about 15% of the state's employment. Currently 90/% of Sao Paulo's&#13;
economically active population of about 14.3 million lives in rural areas, less than one-&#13;
third of the figure for 1960.&#13;
1.11 Land Tenure, Use and Production. Sao Paulo's land ownership pattern is one of&#13;
medium concentration in the Brazilian context (Annex A, Table A.2). Farms under 100 ha&#13;
(88% of all farms) occupy 29%/o of total farmland, and farms over 1,000 ha (less than one&#13;
percent of all farms) cover 28% of total farmland. In 1986 about 69%/o of the 282,500&#13;
rural properties were owner-operated. At present 6% of farmland is planted to perennial&#13;
crops, 21% to annual crops, 42% is under improved or natural pasture, and 17% is under&#13;
native or planted forest; the balance represents uncultivable land. In addition to being the&#13;
main producer of citrus and derivatives (84% of national output), the State is also the&#13;
major producer of peanuts (89%), sugarcane (54%), onions (26%), tomatoes (36%),&#13;
potatoes (23%), eggs (28%), and the second largest producer of cotton, beans, sorghum,&#13;
grapes, milk and honey. It also contributes a substantial share of the national production&#13;
of coffee (14%), maize (13%), beef (20%) and poultry meat (15%). The State has in use&#13;
24% of Brazil's total number of tractors, and its consumption share of inputs is 30% for&#13;
fertilizers and 36% for pesticides.&#13;
1.12  Agriculture and Natural Resources Protection Services. The State Secretariat&#13;
of Agriculture and Supply (SAA) is responsible, through four coordinating bodies and two&#13;
decentralized agencies, for sectoral planning, agricultural research and all government&#13;
support services, including rural extension. The four coordinating units are: the&#13;
Agricultural Research Coordinating Unit, the Technical Assistance Coordinating Unit&#13;
(CATI); the Input Supply Coordinating Unit, and the Socio-Economic Coordinating Unit.&#13;
The latter is responsible through its Agriculture Economics Institute for collecting and&#13;
updating all socio-economic data.  The Agricultural Research Coordinating Unit&#13;
encompasses five specialized research institutes: the Campinas Agronomic Institute, the&#13;
Zootechnology Institute, the Biological Institute for Plant and Animal Health, the Food&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Technology bntitute, and the Fishery Institute. CATI2, which was recently restructured to&#13;
increase its efficiency and decentralize its services, provides extension services to farmers&#13;
with 1,180 field extensionists distributed among 40 Regional Rural Development Divisions&#13;
(EDR) and 575 Municipal Offices (CAs) (chart B.2). CATI coordinates four departments:&#13;
(i) the technical assistance department (DEXIRU) which coordinates with the Socio-&#13;
Economic Coordinating Unit and provides technical back-up to the EDR's extensionists;&#13;
(ii) the department for quality control of seeds, planting material and breeding stock&#13;
(DSMW) which also undertakes applied research; (iii) the plant and animal protection&#13;
department (DDA); and (iv) the training and communications department. It also has the&#13;
Administrative Center. The two decentralized SAA entities are the Sao Paulo Agricultural&#13;
Development Company (CODASP) which, through its four regional offices, provides&#13;
heavy machinery services to municipalities, and the Sao Paulo Storage Company,&#13;
responsible for government storage. These two companies are in the process of being&#13;
privatized.&#13;
1.13  Farm credit is channeled through the Sao Paulo State Bank (BANESPA), the State&#13;
Savings Bank, the Bank of Brazil, and many private banks. As would be expected in a&#13;
state with highly developed agriculture, producer cooperatives and the private sector in&#13;
general are well organized and handle most of the input supply, output storage and&#13;
marketing. The private sector also provides a large share of technical assistance to&#13;
farmers: the 170 producer cooperatives, grouping 160,000 members, have some 700 field&#13;
extensionists, and there are about 130 private agricultural "planning" companies with some&#13;
250 extension advisory staff. In addition, a number of municipalities have their own&#13;
agricultural departments.&#13;
1.14  Three other state secretariats are directly involved in the protection of natural&#13;
resources: (a) the State Secretariat of Environment (SMA), through its Environmental&#13;
Protection Coordinating Unit, and through two decentralized agencies, the Foundation for&#13;
Forest Conservation and Production and the State Technological Company for&#13;
Environmental Protection, responsible for monitoring land use control and reforestation&#13;
programs and enforcing environmental state law; (b) the State Secretariat of Science and&#13;
Technology; and (c) the State Secretariat of Energy and Sanitation. The latter is more&#13;
specifically involved in water conservation, storage and pollution control. The Water and&#13;
Electrical Energy Department within SES is responsible in particular for planning and&#13;
coordinating water resource studies and establishing water conservation policies.&#13;
1.15 State's Past Experience in Agricultural Development and Soil Conservation.&#13;
Over the past 50 years Sio Paulo's agriculture has changed from a pioneering phase to&#13;
become settled, increasingly technically advanced, and highly commercial. The great&#13;
majority of the state's 282,500 farms are now partially or fully mechanized. Animal&#13;
2 Created by Decree N0 48.133 of June 20, 1967, and restructured under Decree N° 41.608 of February&#13;
24, 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
traction is increasiny being superseded. Manual cultivation, still common in other states,&#13;
is rare.&#13;
1.16  Intensification of agriculture has brought about increasing pressure on natural&#13;
resources. Sio Paulo's forests, which originally covered over 65% of its total area, now&#13;
extend to only about 11% (2.8 million ha); 7% (1.8 million ha) is native forest found on&#13;
the coastal ridges of the Serra do Mar and Serra Mantiqueira. Cultivable soils cover 62%&#13;
of the state area, but nearly all are of only moderate quality, and large areas have been&#13;
under continuous cultivation for a generation or more. The familiar symptoms of land&#13;
degeneration are becoming an increasing concern to farmers and the state government:&#13;
loss of soil structure, compaction, surface sealing and crusting, excessive rainfall runoff&#13;
sheet and gully (vo,orocas) erosion, flooding, silting of riverbeds and reservoirs, rising&#13;
costs of production as lost nutrients have to be replaced, generally declining growth rates&#13;
in yields of main crops such as cotton, soybean, sugarcane, and citrus (Annex A, Table&#13;
A.3) and, as a consequence, lowered farm profitability.&#13;
1.17 Growing concern for these problems led Sio Paulo in 1986 to launch a study&#13;
under the coordination of the Electrical Energy Department, to map the erosion risk in the&#13;
watershed of the Peixe-Paranapanema River which covers about one-third of the state&#13;
area, and to evaluate erosion damage and its impact on the region. In 1997, it also created&#13;
the Water Resources Council,3 with conditions for a decentralized State Water Resource&#13;
Manaement System, while the SAA started, on a pilot scale, the State Mlcrocatchment&#13;
Program (PEMBH) based on the microcatchment (microbacia hidrografica) approach to&#13;
soil conservation, similar to the one initiated in 1983 in the neighboring State of Parana&#13;
(para 1.6). As a complement to these initiatives, in 1988 the State promulgated the Land&#13;
Use and Conservation Law4. Since then, 122 microcatchments, selected from among Sao&#13;
Paulo's 40 EDRs, have been supported through incentive programs aimed primarily at&#13;
promoting mechanical (mainly terracing) soil conservation practices. The recommended&#13;
works, although planned at the microcatchment level, have been undertaken, for the most&#13;
part, on an individual basis and without sufficient community participation. In addition,&#13;
not only was the pilot too small to have a demonstration effect at the state level but, most&#13;
importantly, the Land Use and Conservation Law was not regulated until April 7, 19975&#13;
and therefore it could not be enforced.&#13;
1.18 The improved land management practices theoretically available to Sio Paulo's&#13;
farmers are not yet used for the most part. This has been partly due to the legacy of the&#13;
3 Decree N0 27.576 of November 11, 1997, expanded by Decree N' 32.954 of February 7, 1991. Since&#13;
then, basin comnuittees for all but two state water basing have been created.&#13;
4  Law N0 6.171 of July 4, 1988 was amended by Law N0 8.421 of November 1993 as a condition to&#13;
negotiae the loan.&#13;

-7-&#13;
pioneering past, when exhausted land could readily be replaced by the clearing of new&#13;
areas, and partly due to the lack of advice to farmers on the integrated and interdependent&#13;
nature of the remedies which are recommended; public and private extension is still mainly&#13;
based on individual commodities or inputs. In spite of a growing demand from farmer&#13;
communities and local authorities for an expanded PEMBH, lessons learned underline the&#13;
need to (a) intensify community environmental awareness and participation in&#13;
environmental protection at the microcatchment level; (b) change the philosophy of&#13;
traditional agricultural extension programs toward natural resource management and&#13;
sustainable rural development strategies, emphasizing participatory planning&#13;
methodologies; (c) increase research to adapt soil and moisture conservation techniques to&#13;
various local communities; (d) improve the targeting, transparency and effectiveness of&#13;
state incentive programs to promote on-farm land management, soil conservation, and&#13;
pollution control activities; and (e) enhance enforcement of the recently regulated State&#13;
Soil Conservation Law. The State of Sao Paulo has quite an enterprising farming&#13;
community interested in improving land management. The private sector is heavily&#13;
involved in the supply of inputs, machinery, seeds and planting material, and in associated&#13;
research and extension, but is mainly based on commodity-based services. The project&#13;
will complement these efforts by undertaking an integrated approach towards natural&#13;
resource management at the grassroots level, directed mainly to the more vulnerable areas&#13;
and population.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. ORIGINAND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1   The Bank's assistance strategy for Brazil, which was discussed by the Executive&#13;
Directors on June 12, 1997, places poverty reduction and equitable growth as its central&#13;
objectives. It aims at supporting (i) structural reforms to consolidate stabilization and&#13;
growth to set the stage for private sector-led growth; (ii) poverty alleviation through&#13;
broad-based growth and targeted health, education, and rural and urban programs;&#13;
(iii) promotion and financing of infrastructure expansion; and (iv) promotion of&#13;
environmentally sustainable development. Soil erosion problems in the mechanized South,&#13;
Southeast and Central-West threaten to undermine past efficiency gains on the country's&#13;
most productive farm lands and to seriously affect the equilibrium of local ecosystems&#13;
through pollution of water sources and sedimentation of rivers. In addition, a significant&#13;
number of small farmers are located in zones with the highest susceptibility to erosion.&#13;
Through its support for the proposed project, the fifth in a series of pioneer state projects,&#13;
the Bank will be instrumental in helping the State of Sao Paulo to develop innovative and&#13;
economically viable investments in soil conservation, water pollution control and overall&#13;
land management to implement a decentralized and transparent natural resource&#13;
management policy.&#13;
2.2   The proposed project had its origin in the alarming conclusions of the Peixe-&#13;
Paranapanema River study (para 1.17), confirmed by Sao Paulo farmers' increasing&#13;
concern about the most obvious symptoms of soil erosion such as sheet and gully erosion&#13;
and silting of river beds and reservoirs.  Recognizing the effectiveness of the&#13;
mnicrocatchment strategy being tested in the State, and applied more extensively in&#13;
neighboring states, to arrest the serious and increasing erosion problem affecting a large&#13;
portion of its territory, the State Government sought Bank support to finance the&#13;
proposed project. The project was appraised by the Bank in November 1992 and&#13;
negotiated in February-March 1994. However, due mainly to the financial difficulties&#13;
prevailing in the State at that time, the project could not be presented to the Board. Soon&#13;
after the State concluded its debt restructuring with the Federal Government, and at the&#13;
request of the Government, a post-negotiation mission took place in May 1997. While the&#13;
priority of the project was confirmed by the Bank and the Government, there was a need&#13;
to adjust the project to reflect: (a) the institutional, economic, and political changes that&#13;
occurred in the State since project negotiations; (b) the lessons learned from implementing&#13;
similar projects in the neighboring states of Parana and Santa Catarina (paras. 1.7-1.8);&#13;
and (c) the experience gained by the state from implementing the PEMBH in a limited&#13;
number of microcatchments while awaiting Bank financing (para 1.18). In particular,&#13;
there was a need for greater transparency and decentralization of project activities.&#13;
Renegotiation of the proposed project took place from September 8 to 12, 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
B  PRoJEcT AREA AND BENEFICIARIEs&#13;
2.3    The proposed project will include about 1,500 microcatchments covering an area&#13;
of about 4.5 million ha, to be selected among the State's 40 EDR The project will benefit&#13;
about 90,000 farms, 85% of them with holdings of less than 100 ha, representing 30%&#13;
of the state's fanmers. It will concentrate its efforts in highly eroded areas or those highly&#13;
susceptible to erosion which at the same time present the highest concentration of poverty.&#13;
To that end, each EDR has been ranked based on two factors: (a) susceptibility to soil&#13;
erosion6, a coefficient which takes into  consideration potential for erosion, soil&#13;
degradation expectation, existing erosion, and concentration of small and medium farmers&#13;
in the region, and level of farmers' response to the pilot program; and (b) concentration of&#13;
poverty7, a coefficient that measures the concentration of families with less than two basic&#13;
salaries per month. Municipalities within each region, and microcatchments in each&#13;
municipality, will be selected by the Regional Rural Development Councils (CRDR) and&#13;
the Municipal Rural Development Councils (CMDR) respectively, based on criteria&#13;
specified in the Project Implementation Manual Operational Manual (para 2.10 and Annex&#13;
B). These organizations will be the focal point for planning and implementation of project&#13;
activities. All 40 CRDRs and 288 of the 646 CMDRs have now been created and are in&#13;
operation. Project intervention will require the existence of a CMDR, and the project will&#13;
assist in the creation of such entities..&#13;

C. PROJECT OBJECriVES&#13;
2.4   The objectives of the proposed project will be to increase and sustain agricultural&#13;
production, productivity and farm incomes and assist in the conservation of natural&#13;
resources by: (a) promoting the adoption of sustainable, modem forms of land&#13;
management and soil, water and forest conservation planned and implemented at the&#13;
microcatchment level and with full involvement of the farming community; (b) developing&#13;
community environmental awareness and participation in environmental protection efforts;&#13;
(c) increasing the extent and duration of vegetative soil cover, thus better protecting the&#13;
soil against sealing under intense summer rainfill; and (d) improving internal soil structure&#13;
and drainage, thus increasing water infiltration, and safely disposing of any remaining&#13;
runoff. The results will be increased farm profitability, and reduced loss of top soil, silting&#13;
of reservoirs and stream beds, floods, destruction of rural roads, falling water tables,&#13;
poliution of water sources and depletion of natural resources. The project will also&#13;
strengthen the State of Sao Paulo's capacity to implement more efficiently an expanded&#13;
natural resource management and conservation program.&#13;
D. PRoJEcT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.5   Building on the model developed for previous projects in this series (paras. 1.6-&#13;
1.8), and on theV State's PEMBH pilot experience (paras. 1.17-1.18), the proposed project&#13;
strategy will promote the adoption of integrated measures for natural resource&#13;
management and conservation using the microcatchment area as the unit for participatory&#13;
planning, monitoring and collective implementation. This participatory philosophy will&#13;
include farmers, local authorities, and private and public entities, and will be supported by&#13;
an effective incentive program and trained extension agents. The design of the State&#13;
Government's intervention at the microcatchment level is based on the proven benefits of&#13;
collective and properly planned action in soil erosion control and other conservation and&#13;
management techniques, while it also recognizes that economic benefits derived from&#13;
sound conservation practices are captured not only by the individual farmers but also by&#13;
the community at large.&#13;
2.6   The proposed project will include six components: (a) a Technology and&#13;
Institutional Development component, which will finance (i) Rural Extension; (ii) Rural&#13;
Organization; and (iii) Agro-Ecological Mapping at the microcatchment level; (b) an&#13;
Adaptive Agricultural Research component; (c) an Incentive Program for Natural&#13;
Resource Management and Conservation component, which will finance:&#13;
(i) Environmental Education; (ii) Incentives Fund for Soil Management and Conservation&#13;
and Pollution Control, (iii) Incentive for Recovery of Degraded Lands; (iv) Reforestation;&#13;
and (v) Enforcement of the Soil Use Law and of the above-mentioned Project Incentives;&#13;
(d) Erosion Control Works in the Rural Roads component, which is an integral part of the&#13;
microcatchment interventions; (e) Training and Dissemination; and (f) a Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Coordination and Administration component, which will finance (i)rmonitoring and&#13;
evauation, and (ii) Internal and External Auditing&#13;
Technology and Instonld Development (2&amp; 8% of total costs)&#13;
2.7   This component will facilitate the implementation of the project's technical&#13;
strategy and provide technical assistance to farmers to encourage their adoption of the&#13;
recommended natural resource management practices.  It will aim  to develop&#13;
microcatchment land users' awareness and technical knowledge to improve natural&#13;
resource management and promote active participation of the farmers and their families in&#13;
the planning and execution of their programs for improved land management and soil&#13;
conservation, through the financing of the following subcomponents: (a) Rural Extension;&#13;
(b) Rural Orgaiization; and (c) Agro-ecological Mapping.&#13;
2.8   Rural Extension: (21.4% of total cost). Implementation of this subcomponent&#13;
will be the responsibility of CATI's Extension Service through the CAs, while technical&#13;
assistance to microcatchment farmers will be provided from four main sources: CATI's&#13;
extension officers, technical staff of participating municipal governments, private&#13;
extensionists from producers' cooperatives or associations, and private agricultural&#13;
planning firms. The project will encourage and bring about a new form of agricultural&#13;
extension that involves methodological modifications of the current product-focused&#13;
extension, towards one focused on the microcatchment productivity systems in which the&#13;
fnailies and rural communities are active participants. In order to seek greater overall&#13;
efficiency, cost reduction and decentralization of the public system, a key objective of the&#13;
project-supported rural extension subcomponent will be to promote more active&#13;
beneficiary participation using the microcatchment as a working unit. To that end, the&#13;
project will provide operational and technical guidelines and intensive training to all&#13;
extension staff including municipal and private extensionists, to transform traditional&#13;
extension programs into modem programs of sustainable development.&#13;
2.9   To ensure that the project achieves its main objectives, it will be essential that the&#13;
agricultural community and the public at large understand the technical strategy of the&#13;
project.  Therefore, in its initial stages the project will provide for an intensive&#13;
dissemination campaign (para. 2.30).  CATI extensionists will be responsible for&#13;
promoting farmers' participation and ensuring the formation of the CMDR in&#13;
municipalities where this committee has not yet been formed, and of producers'&#13;
associations in project microcatchments. They will also be responsible for identify"ing the&#13;
farmers' organizations and informal farmer leaders and private technical assistants who&#13;
will be trained to serve as facilitators in the implementation of the project. The selection&#13;
of the municipalities to participate in the program will be the responsibility of the CRDR,&#13;
while the microcatchments within particular municipalities will be selected by the CMDR,&#13;
based on objective criteria as specified in the Implementation Manual (Annex B). Prior to&#13;
initiating project activities in a selected municipality, the latter will enter into an agreement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
with SAA specifying, inter alia, its commitment to implement the project in accordance&#13;
with the Project Implementation Manual, including maintenance of roads rehabilitated&#13;
under the project (para. 2.29), and to monitor implementation of improved natural&#13;
resource management practices at the microcatchment level. The agreement to be signed&#13;
between these two institutions was approved by Decree N° 41.990 of July 23, 1997 and is&#13;
part of the Implemetation Manual. Once the agreement is signed, a participatory&#13;
socioeconomic survey of each new microcatchment will be conducted under the&#13;
coordination of the project extensionists. In areas in which there is no CA extensionist&#13;
available, the project will contract private extensionists with the participation of the&#13;
CMDR and the microcatchment association. It is estimated that about 150 of the 300&#13;
extensionists required under the project will be hired under these municipal arrangements.&#13;
2.10  Based on the results of a participatory socioeconomic and agro-ecological survey&#13;
to be carried out under the responsibility of the project extensionist9, and on the&#13;
agroecological maps to be produced under the project (para. 2.13, 2.14), the project&#13;
extensionist, together with the microcatchment beneficiaries, will prepare a mutually-&#13;
agreed Microcatchment Development Plan (PGM) which identifies the principal&#13;
agronomic and environmental problems and proposes solutions through collective land&#13;
and water management activities. The PGM will set technical targets for all community&#13;
works and interventions recommended at the farm-level and will be supported by&#13;
individual farm land-use plans (PIPs) and by plans for collective activities (PECs) when&#13;
applicable (para 2.22). It will also identify any recommended intervention that will require&#13;
environmental licensing. The project extensionist, assisted by the EDR and the Project&#13;
Administration Unit (UJGP) (para. 2.32), will seek the environmental license for the PGM&#13;
as a wholel0. The PGM will then be submitted to the CMDR for its appreciation and&#13;
forwarded to the CRDR and UGP for approval (paras. 2.36-2.38). Once the PIPs and&#13;
PECs have been approved, farmers and associations will be required to sign contracts with&#13;
CATI to receive project financial benefits (paras. 2.20-2.25). The PGM for each&#13;
microcatchment will follow technical and procedural guidelines provided in the&#13;
Implementation Manual prepared by CATI with substantial input from research entities,&#13;
universities and progressive farmers to orient and integrate project interventions at the&#13;
microcatchment level. It identifies recommended technologies for the most common&#13;
problems currently identified in the microcatchment project area (Annex B).  The&#13;
Implementation Manual (Technical and Operational) originally approved by SAA&#13;
Resolution N0 6171 of July 4, 1994 has been extensively reviewed and revised to take into&#13;
account lessons learned during the implementation of the Sao Paulo pilot and the projects&#13;
9  Field suvey will be complemented with information from the Projeto de Levantamento Consit6rio&#13;
de Unidades de Produftlo Agropecu6ria do Estado de Sao Paulo (L UPA) of April 26, 1995 and&#13;
Survey of the Agricultural Productive Units of the State of Sao Paulo carried out by CATI and SAA&#13;
during 1995-1996.&#13;
10 Joint Resolution SMA/SAA-4 of April 4, 1997 regulates the environmental licensing under the&#13;
PEMBH.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
in the neighboring States of Parana and Santa Catarina (para. 2.2). The revised version of&#13;
the Manual was approved with SAA Resolution N 4 of September 19, 1997. Assurances&#13;
have been obtained from the State Government that: (a) the Implementation Manual&#13;
will be followed by project staff, extensionists, technicians, CRDR, CMDR and&#13;
municipalities while implementing project-related activities, and regularly updated in&#13;
agreement with the Bank; (b) prior to initiating project activities in a selected municipality,&#13;
SAA and the municipal government will enter into an agreement for the implementation of&#13;
all aspects of the project; and (c) prior to any on-farm project intervention, the farmer&#13;
and/or farmers' association will enter into an agreement with SAA for such&#13;
implementation (para. 3.2 (a)). Models of such agreements are part of the Implementation&#13;
Manual.&#13;
2.11   The work of project extension agents is central to the successful implementation of&#13;
the projects technical and operational strategies. In addition to providing technical&#13;
assistance to producers, extensionists will act as executive secretaries of the CMDRs and&#13;
will support the implementation of other components by assisting with the organization of&#13;
farmers' associations, testing and dissemination of adaptive research, the promotion of&#13;
environment-related activities, the preparation of PIPs and farmers' applications of project&#13;
incentives, and the planning and implementation of road improvement activities. The&#13;
project will provide for orientation meetings and field excursions to transfer and&#13;
demonstrate recommended technology and project objectives to benefiting farmers. CATI&#13;
extensionists, jointly with municipal extensionists, will provide active assistance and&#13;
training in conservation techniques to farmers' associations in each new microcatchment&#13;
area during the first three years, and follow-up assistance and monitoring for two years&#13;
thereafter.  CATI extensionists and municipal extensionists will provide individual&#13;
assistance to small-scale farmers as available capacity permits. Private extensionists and&#13;
private agricultural planning firms will provide complementary assistance to their&#13;
respective clients, principally medium- and large-scale farmers, at the individual farm level.&#13;
2.11  To accomplish these activities, the subcomponent will finance: (a) vehicles, computer&#13;
equipment, and appropriate field equipment for CATI's extension staff assigned to project&#13;
activities; (c) incremental operating costs for about 150 CATI professionals; and (d) services&#13;
contracted out to some 150 extensionists to be recruited by selected municipalities with the&#13;
participation of farmers' associations.&#13;
2.12 Rural Organization: (2.9% of total cost). The existence of strong farmers'&#13;
associations within a microcatchment is of strategic importance for the implementation of&#13;
the project concept. It will help to ensure the continuity of actions after the life of the&#13;
project, as well as to achieve the component's decentralization and efficiency objectives.&#13;
Therefore, under this subcomponent the project will provide up to US$3,500 per&#13;
association to finance selective administrative and managerial equipment (including office&#13;
equipment, microcomputers, etc.) and consultant services to strengthen the institutional&#13;
capacity of farmers' associations. To access such benefits, associations will: (a) have to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
formally constituted; (b) have at least 70% of its members within the microcatchment&#13;
benefiting from the project; (c) have been in the program, and implementing the activities&#13;
caUed for in the PGM, for at least one year; and (d) have prepared a project justifying the&#13;
requested services and approved by at least 70%  of its members.  The project&#13;
Administration Unit (UGP) within CATI (para. 2.32) will be responsible for the&#13;
implementation of this subcomponent with the assistance of the EDRs, project&#13;
extensionists, and CMDR, as described in the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
2.13 Agro-ecological Mapping: (4.5% of the totil cost). A set of maps will be&#13;
produced under this subconponent, which will constitute key technical instruments to&#13;
field extensionists in soil classification and land use planning, and up-to-date resource&#13;
information to the state technicians and the farmer community. Five maps will be produced&#13;
for each microcatchment to be benefited under the project. They will be a basic technical input&#13;
for the strategic planning of activities to be developed in each microcatchment under the PGM&#13;
(para. 2.10) and will be used, in particular, for environmental education, recommendation of&#13;
more benign agncultural practices, recommended changes in land use and in the production&#13;
system, selection of degraded areas to be recovered, identification of the segments of roads to&#13;
be rehabilitated, and for enforcement of land use laws. The maps to be prepared under this&#13;
subomponent are a map of the municipality, idetifyg the location of the microcatchment&#13;
with reference to the municipajity, and the following microcatchment maps: (a) a topographical&#13;
map; (b) a soils map; (c) land tenire structure; and (d) an analytical map of environmental risk.&#13;
These maps are descnbed in the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
2.14 Implementation of this subcomponent will be the responsibility of CATI's regional&#13;
technical unit under direct supervision of the Technical Unit of the UGP (para. 2.37).&#13;
However, during the first two years of the project, the production of these maps wili be&#13;
contracted to private firms while CATI's regional technical staff is being trained. This&#13;
subcomponent will finance vehicles and field equipment for 40 regional technical units,&#13;
consultant services for the production of the maps during the first two years of the project;&#13;
and incremental recurrent costs for the 40 regional technical units that will be incorporated&#13;
gradually into the program.&#13;
Adaptive Agricultural Research (2.6% of total cost)&#13;
2.15  The principal objective of the research component is to endorse the project's&#13;
technical strategy by developing or adapting adequate technological solutions for problems&#13;
identified by the farming community at the microcatchment level. The component will test&#13;
and demonstrate the effectiveness of existing technology (Annex B, Table B.3) in soil&#13;
conservation, land management and pollution control, and will generate new applied&#13;
technology suitable for different types of soil and agroeconomic conditions. In response&#13;
to the project's target population and to amplify the demonstration effect, emphasis will be&#13;
placed on executing research trials on the property of small-scale farmers. To this end, the&#13;
project will finance some 40 research projects and about 270 adaptive research trials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Efforts will be centered mainly on: soil management practices, rational use of inputs and&#13;
residual disposal, focusing on combinations of soil preparation methods, mnimum- and&#13;
no-tillage techniques, crop rotations, green manuring, soil fertility, soil cover practices,&#13;
integrated pest management, sustainable production systems for small farmers, crop&#13;
diversification with alternative annual and perennial crops; waste disposal; integrated pest&#13;
management; and improved pasture management, among others.&#13;
2.16 The Agricultural Adaptive Research Unit within the UGP (para. 2.32) will be&#13;
responsible for implementing and monitoring the adaptive research program. This unit&#13;
will be assisted by an Adaptive Research Committee, comprised of five highly qualified&#13;
researchers, two from the SAA and three from the State Universities. This Committee,&#13;
together with the Adaptive Research Unit, will: identify research projects based on&#13;
demands coming from the benefiting microcatchments and EDRs; identify prospective&#13;
researchers; review research proposals; monitor their implementation; and evaluate results.&#13;
Applied research projects will be carried out by various research institutes contracted out&#13;
by the UGP to public and private research institutes, universities and other competent&#13;
public or private entities. Research trials will be carried out by the project extensionists&#13;
under the direct supervision of individual researchers from either CATI or SAA, or&#13;
contracted out as required, and will be under the supervision of the Adaptive Research&#13;
Unit with assistance from the EDRs and project extensionists. The proposed research&#13;
program will be demand-driven and participatory: the evaluation of on-going trials and the&#13;
planning of annual programs will be discussed with farmers' representatives, extensionists&#13;
and representatives of private and public research institutions at regional- and state-level&#13;
workshops organized by the UGP. Research results will be transferred to extensionists&#13;
and farmers through seminars and field days and brochures, organized by CATI with the&#13;
collaboration of the research entities and or individuals responsible for the particular&#13;
projects. Selection criteria to evaluate the research as well as its operational procedures&#13;
are part of the Implementation Manual.&#13;
2.17 To carry out the aforementioned tasks, the project will finance: (a) contracting of&#13;
specialized services for specific research projects, specific field experiments, socio-&#13;
economic and soil surveys; (b) infrastructure, field equipment and inputs for research&#13;
trials; and (c) incremental operating costs to accompany the field trial.&#13;
Incentive Program for Natural Resource Management and Conservation (27% of total&#13;
costs)&#13;
2.18  The main objective of this component will be to induce and accelerate the adoption&#13;
of improved natural resource management and conservation techniques by&#13;
microcatchment communities. To that end, through this component the project will:&#13;
(i) develop community environmental awareness and participation in environmental&#13;
protection through a decentralized program of environmental education; (ii) stimulate an&#13;
early and integrated adoption of improved natural resource management and conservation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
techniques, through the provision of incentive grants on a demonstration basis, in&#13;
particular m soil and water conservation, recovery of degraded lands and reforestation of&#13;
areas, mainly on steeper slopes and strips along water courses, and (iii) enforce the land&#13;
use and conservation legislation. This component will promote the adoption of the&#13;
recommended practices in the PGM through an integrated program of environmental&#13;
education and incentive grants for small- and medium-size farms and a program to enforce&#13;
correct use of the natural resources. The design of the incentive grants reflects the fact&#13;
that economic benefits derived from sound conservation practices are captured not only by&#13;
the individual farmers but also by the community as a whole. The maximum grant per&#13;
beneficiary will be US$3,000 including individual and collective project incentives.&#13;

2.19   Environmental Education: (0.6% of total cost). The environmental education&#13;
activities of the project will contribute to the sustainability of project interventions. It will&#13;
induce a change in social behavior with respect to the use and conservation of natural&#13;
resources by creating suitable environmental awareness in the microcatchment community&#13;
and among the public at large. The subcomponent's methodology will be based on&#13;
decentralized actions and will reinforce project activities at the field level. The project's&#13;
environmental education will be directed toward microcatchment farmers and associated&#13;
communities. It will support the project's microcatchment activities and technical strategy&#13;
and will fall under the responsibility of the project extensionist, with support from&#13;
environmental monitors identified in each microcatchment by their respective communities&#13;
and trained under the project. They will be supervised by the head of the Environmental&#13;
Unit within the UGP (para. 2.32). With the assistance of the environmental monitor and&#13;
the CMDR, the project will also include support to formal environmental education&#13;
programs, directed toward schools in participating municipalities, with respect to the&#13;
planning and management of natural resource use in their respective microcatchments. As&#13;
required by the CMDR, the project will train local leaders and teachers in the use of&#13;
educational materials and games designed to introduce children to their local environment&#13;
and  spark  their interest in its preservation.   The subcomponent will finance:&#13;
(a) purchasing and/or contracting of private entities to prepare environmental education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
programs and games, videos and teaching materials; (b) audio-visual equipment;&#13;
(c) technical assistance; and (d) incremental operating costs.&#13;
2.20 Incentive Fund for Soil Management and Conservation and Pollution&#13;
Control: (13.6% of total cost). To promote a rapid and integrated adoption of modem&#13;
techniques of land management, soil conservation and pollution control practices as&#13;
recommended in the technical strategy (Annex B), the project will finance the Incentive&#13;
Program for Land Management, Soil Conservation and Pollution Control (1P) created by&#13;
Law 8421 of November 1993". The IP will provide limited financial support in the form&#13;
of grants to eligible small- and medium-scale farmers for specific activities which are&#13;
necessary to accomplish the project's technical strategy as recommended in the PGM, and&#13;
which require collective investments generating only long-term returns or yield benefits to&#13;
society at large. The demonstration effect engendered by the activities financed under the&#13;
IP will accelerate adoption of conservation techniques by farmers both inside and outside&#13;
the project microcatchments. The UGP created within CATI (para. 2.32) will be&#13;
responsible for administering the IP. CATI's DDA will control the application of funds&#13;
awarded under the IP (para. 2.26).&#13;
2.21  The IP consolidates previous state subsidies granted under PEMBH, improves&#13;
their targeting to small farmers and provides for greater transparency and decentralization.&#13;
It will be gradually phased out and terminated by the end of project implementation, as&#13;
benefits become more visible to farmers and demonstration effects take place. The IP will&#13;
finance a decreasing share, depending on the farm size, specific activity, and project year,&#13;
of various soil conservation subprojects. Five types of subprojects will be financed under&#13;
this Fund and assisted by the project. Two will be for farmer groups: (a) collective&#13;
purchase of specific farm implements to undertake reduced tillage and improved land&#13;
management practices (e.g., deep rippers, lime spreaders, and knife rollers); and&#13;
(b) construction of water supply systems for agro-chemical mixing points to avoid&#13;
pollution of streams and water sources. Three will be for individual farmers: (a) land&#13;
management practices (such as contour farming and strip cropping, vegetative contours,&#13;
bunding and terracing); (b) protective fencing along water courses; and (c) provision of&#13;
seeds for green manure crops (Table B-4). The Implementation Manual provides detailed&#13;
procedures to guide farmers, project extensionists, CMDR, CRDR, and the UGP&#13;
executing this subcomponent.  It specifies eligibility criteria (based on farm  size,&#13;
dependence of farm income, and site of residency), grant terms, limits and conditions, and&#13;
operating mechanisms and procedures. Assurances have been obtained from the State&#13;
Government that the incentive program established by the Soil Conservation Law will be&#13;
implemented in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Implementation Manual&#13;
(para. 3.2 (b)).&#13;
The law created the Incentive Program as an integral part of the PEMBH to be financed by the Bank&#13;
Loan. The Fund will become operational once the Bank Loan is approved and signed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
2.22 Following recommendations and targets contained in the corresponding PGM, the&#13;
extensionists assigned to the project, either from CATI or from the municipalities,&#13;
together with the benefiting famers, will prepare the PIPs and the PECs for individual or&#13;
collective projects, respectively (para 2.10). The PGM and the funding required for its&#13;
implementation, both for collective and individual subprojects, will then be reviewed and&#13;
approved by the respective CMDR. Consolidated, approved plans from a municipality&#13;
will be forwarded to the corresponding EDR for technical clearance and review by the&#13;
CRDR, and then to the UGP for final approval and processing. Farmers will enter into&#13;
implementation agreements with the SAA to benefit from the IP under terms and&#13;
conditions specified in the Implementation Manual. Once a subproject has been completed&#13;
by an individual or by a farmer group, the intended beneficiary will request payment from&#13;
the IP Fund, and disbursement by the UGP to the beneficiary will be made only once the&#13;
CMDR and the extensionist responsible for the development of the subproject have&#13;
verified its satisfactory completion. If a beneficiary does not use and maintain the&#13;
subproject as intended, legal means will be used to have the grant refunded with full&#13;
monetary correction.&#13;
2.23 Incentive for Recovery of Degraded Lands (5.1% of total cost). The main&#13;
objective of this subcomponent will be to induce the adoption of land management&#13;
techniques to recover degraded lands, as recommended in the PGM (para. 2.10). State&#13;
financing for the recovery of degraded lands has its origin in Law 8421 of November&#13;
1993. The degrees of degradation of the areas to be benefited under the project will have&#13;
a wide range of variation from extremely critical with accelerated land degradation and&#13;
presence of sheet and gully (vogorocas) erosion and hence in urgent need of stabilization&#13;
measures, to areas that still do not present serious erosion problems but, due to the loss of&#13;
soil structure and insufficient vegetative cover, need substantial changes in management&#13;
techniques to prevent more serious soil erosion. Therefore, based on the participatory&#13;
socio-economic agro-ecological survey, the microcatchment community will identify&#13;
critical areas that will need to be recovered. Two types of subprojects will be financed&#13;
under this subcomponent for small and medium farmers to recover degraded lands in&#13;
accordance with the recommendations of the PGM: (a) individual projects for the control&#13;
of sheet and gully erosion; and (b) collective projects to groups of farmers for farm&#13;
equipment to reduce tillage and improve land management practices. The rules and&#13;
criteria for benefiting from this incentive are detailed in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
Criteria for classification of farms and farmer groups, as well as for the administration of&#13;
the incentive, are the same as those for the IP (para. 2.22), the difference being that, in&#13;
accordance with the 1993 law, this incentive will be provided to the farms in kind. The&#13;
UGP within CATI (para 2.32) will be responsible for administering this subcomponent.&#13;
Procedures for the implementation of this subcomponent are detailed in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual.&#13;
2.24 Forestry Development (6.5% of total costs). This component aims at inducing&#13;
the microcatchmnent community to reforest either continuous protected strips along water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
courses or small plots on steeper areas or shallow solid soil unsuitable for agriculture, in&#13;
particular to improve the quality of water, regulate the river flows, and decrease&#13;
sedimentation. Based on the microcatchment's analytical map of environmental risk, the&#13;
microcatchment community, guided by the extensionist, will identify the areas to be&#13;
reforested and included in the PGM (para. 2.10). The PGM, together with the PIPs&#13;
identifying the reforestation requirements, will be processed following the same&#13;
procedures as outlined for the IP (para. 2.22). This subcomponent will provide about 13&#13;
million seedlings of native species to beneficiary farmers to plant about 11,000 ha for&#13;
conservation purposes at the microcatchment level. A small portion of the seedlings&#13;
required under the project will be produced by CATI's DSMM, while most of them will&#13;
be procured from private nurseries in the proximity of the microcatchments to be&#13;
reforested. Given the strong externalities of the reforestation activities in a state that has&#13;
lost a substantial amount of its forest cover in a relatively short time, microcatchments or&#13;
individual farmers with permanent forest cover will receive higher ratings to qualify for&#13;
other project incentives. Procedures for the implementation of this subcomponent are&#13;
detailed in the Project hnplementation Manual.&#13;
2.25 The DSMM within CATI, in close coordination with the EDRs and the project&#13;
extensionists, will plan and coordinate the timely procurement, production, and&#13;
distribution to microcatchment beneficiaries of planting material for conservation&#13;
reforestation. The project will provide up to 2,600 seedlings (to plant up to 2 Ha.) to&#13;
frmers free of charge (since social benefits far exceed private gain) following the&#13;
recommendations of the PGM and in accordance with the PIPs.&#13;
2.26  State Environmental Law  Enforcement (1.2%  of total cost).   This&#13;
subcomponent will improve enforcement of environmental legislation concerning land use,&#13;
soil conservation and mrual pollution in the project area. Law N° 8421 of November 23,&#13;
1993, which amended and expanded the Soil Conservation Law of July 4, 1988, assigned&#13;
law enforcement responsibility to SAA. However, this law was not regulated until April&#13;
16, 1997 by Decree 41.719 which granted CATI the direct responsibility for enforcement&#13;
of soil conservation laws. CATI will enforce the legislation through its regional DDA&#13;
offices to ensure that: (a) the newly regulated state environmental law is complied with in&#13;
the project area; (b) the different incentives provided under the project are being&#13;
implemented in accordance with the Project Implementation Manual and the respective&#13;
agreements; and (c) the quality of the planting material used for the conservation&#13;
reforestation is adequate. While the soil legislation will be enforced statewide, law&#13;
enforcement will concentrate its efforts on the 1,500 microcatchments to be benefited&#13;
under the project. It will draw substantial support for law enforcement from the CRDR,&#13;
CMDR and farmers' associations. Incentives to be financed under the project will be&#13;
controlled based on a random sample of 20% of the individual or collective projects. The&#13;
project will finance additional vehicles and computing equipment and incremental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
recurrent costs to strengthen 24 DDA regional offices, 17 of which will be in the priority&#13;
area.&#13;
Erosion Control Works alog Rural Roads (25. 7% of total costs)&#13;
2.27 This component will aim to overcome localized erosion problems and prevent&#13;
further problems caused by water run-off along benefiting microcatchment networks, and&#13;
as an integral part of the PGM (para. 2.10). Proposed project works on about 6,000 km&#13;
will improve year-round road access and reduce maintenance costs. The programmed&#13;
works will include: (a) minor reshaping of road profiles, with shoulder remodeling;&#13;
(b) various drainage and erosion control works, including construction of flood control&#13;
tanks, diversion ditches and farm road junctions with field terraces; and (c) road&#13;
regravelling. A Road Rehabilitation Unit was established within the UGP (para. 2.32) to&#13;
coordinate and administer this component, with support from the EDR's technical units,&#13;
the project extensionists and Municipal Governments.&#13;
2.28 During the initial socio-economic agro-ecological survey of the microcatchment&#13;
area, project extensionists, together with the microcatchment community and local&#13;
technicians, will identify road sections requiring rehabilitation. Based on this information&#13;
and on the criteria established in the Project Implementation Manual, the project&#13;
extensionist, with the participation of the microcatchment community, will prepare a&#13;
Technical Profile of Road Rehabilitation, prioritizing the roads proposed to be included in&#13;
the PGM. The criteria for the selection of road segments to be rehabilitated under the&#13;
project take into account, among others, the number of beneficiaries, the degree of road&#13;
degradation, and adoption of improved natural resources management practices by&#13;
beneficiaries. The PGM will identify the road segment proposed to be rehabilitated, and&#13;
the need for environmental licensing, if any (para. 2.10). The PGM, once approved by the&#13;
CMDR, will be sent to the EDR for consideration.&#13;
2.29 The EDR will be responsible for consolidating the corresponding work plan for the&#13;
municipalities under its jurisdiction which will include the road improvement program, and&#13;
for submitting it to the UGP for approval. Once the work plan has been approved by the&#13;
UGP, road. rehabilitation works will be initiated only if farmers in the respective&#13;
microcatchment areas have begun the activities recommended in the PGM. The UGP's&#13;
Roads Rehabilitation Unit will be responsible for implementing this component (para.&#13;
2.32). Through private contracting firms, the unit will prepare detailed road rehabilitation&#13;
projects, undertake the works and supervise their implementation with the assistance of&#13;
the EDR's technical units and the project extensionists. Technical guidelines for road&#13;
works are part of the Implementation Manual for use by all project extensionists, and&#13;
public and private technicians for the execution of this component. Typical rehabilitation&#13;
works will be simple, small in volume and scattered along the road network and will thus&#13;
require simple designs and engineering. Therefore, EDR's technical units and municipal&#13;
technical staff will be trained to progressively assume these responsibilities under direct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21 -&#13;
supervision of the UGP's Road Rehabilitation Unit. About 90% of the works will be&#13;
contracted out to small private firms or communities following the Bank's procurement&#13;
guidelines, while the remaining 10% will be executed under force account by municipal&#13;
governments. Municipalities will be responsible for road maintenance. The agreement to&#13;
be signed between the SAA and the municipalities prior to initiating any project work in&#13;
each respective municipality provides for municipality commitment to these responsibilities&#13;
(para. 2.9). To ensure adequate maintenance by the participating municipalities, the road&#13;
selection criteria within the Implementation Manual also requires satisfactory maintenance&#13;
of a project-rehabilitated road as a pre-condition for the financing of a second road in a&#13;
particular municipality. This Manual draws substantially from the experience of similar,&#13;
ongoing projects in the neighboring states of Parana and Santa Catarina, and includes&#13;
guidelines to prevent temporary negative environmental impacts during the execution of&#13;
works. The project will finance: (a) civil works for road rehabilitation; (b) technical&#13;
assistance and contracted services; and (c) incremental operating costs.&#13;
Training and Communication (10.3% of total costs)&#13;
2.30  The extensive training program offered by the project will ensure appropriate staff&#13;
training in modem natural resource management and soil conservation practices, increase&#13;
the awareness of project staff and community representatives regarding environmental&#13;
issues and integrate these issues into all project-related activities, and communicate the&#13;
project concept, technical strategy and operational procedures. The training program will&#13;
be complemented by a dissemination strategy on the project's rationale and approach&#13;
through the provision of a series of regional and state-level workshops which will facilitate&#13;
promotion of project activities and results. The project will provide for: (a) advanced&#13;
courses for monitors (trainers of extensionists) and intensive basic courses for CATI and&#13;
municipal and private extensionists on modem natural resource management and soil&#13;
conservation techniques, community organization, participatory planning methodologies,&#13;
and conceptual and operational aspects of the project; (b) introductory courses to&#13;
disseminate the project concept and operational strategy that would be offered for the&#13;
UGP, managers of the EDRs, CATI's state and regional teams for law enforcement, and&#13;
selected project staff belonging to the highest priority area at regional and municipal&#13;
levels; (c) specialized skills courses on specific technical topics, as determined by regions&#13;
and municipalities and by the coordinators of each of the components; (d) courses on&#13;
financial, accounting and procrement matters; (e) regional- and state-level seminars to&#13;
promote the exchange of experiences and disseminate project results to local and regional&#13;
staff of executing agencies and participating institutions, as well as study tours to other&#13;
states and countries to learn from the experiences of similar projects; and (f) dissemination&#13;
of the project's approach to familiarize the general public at the state, regional and&#13;
municipal levels with the rationale behind the project's natural resource management and&#13;
conservation strategy through traveling visual exhibits, video productions and others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
2.31 The Training Unit within the UGP will be responsible for coordinating the&#13;
implementation of this component with CATI's Department of Training and&#13;
Communication. Each Technical Unit within the UGP (para. 2.32) will develop the&#13;
training program based on the demands of the regional and municipal plans and prepare&#13;
the technical content required for each of the courses. The Department of Training and&#13;
Communication will then be responsible for implementing the required training, drawing&#13;
from  in-house and contracted-out specialists.  The training component plays an&#13;
instrumental role in advancing the project philosophy and methodology and hence in&#13;
assuring the sustainability of project activities. The funds for the implementation of the&#13;
training component will be administered and monitored by the UGP through the Training&#13;
Coordinator, in accordance with an annual training program approved by the Project&#13;
Manager. The detailed training strategy and the operational procedures of this component&#13;
are included in the Implementation Manual. The project will finance: (i) consultants and&#13;
specialized services; (ii) study tours within and outside Brazil; (iii) computer, audiovisual,&#13;
and office equipment; (iv) audiovisual production; and (v) incremental recurrent costs.&#13;
Project Administrafion, Monitoring and Evaluation (5.6% of total costs)&#13;
2.32  A Project Administration Unit (UGP) was created by Decree N° 41.990 of July 23,&#13;
1997. It was established within the scope of CATI, but reports directly to the SAA&#13;
Secretary (see Annex B, Chart 3). The structure, function and basic skill requirements for&#13;
the unit are detailed in the Implementation Manual. The structure of the unit consists of a&#13;
general project coordinator and three managers as follows: (a) a technical manager, with&#13;
five technical units-each responsible for one of the project components--plus a&#13;
procurement and contracting unit; (b) a strategic planning manager with three units as&#13;
follows: strategic planning, environmental coordination, and monitoring and evaluation;&#13;
and (c) an administrative and financial manager with two units: disbursements and&#13;
accounting. In addition, an Adaptive Research Committee will be established, attached to&#13;
the technical manager, to assist the UGP in the implementation of the Adaptive Research&#13;
component. The UGP will be directly responsible for the implementation of three&#13;
components: Adaptive Agricultural Research, the Incentive Program for Natural Resource&#13;
Management and Conservation, and the Rural Roads Component, and of one&#13;
subcomponent, the agro-ecological mapping. In addition, an Internal Audit and Control&#13;
Unit (IACU) was created by CATI's Portaria N° 12 of August 20, 1997. It is attached to&#13;
the General Coordinator of CATI to undertake the financial, physical and procedural&#13;
internal audit of the project: The UGP and the IACU will be staffed mainly from within&#13;
CATI through reassignment of responsibilities or from the other SAA entity. Therefore,&#13;
the project will provide intensive training on financial and accounting matters for staff of&#13;
these two units (para. 2.30). The project will also finance additional vehicles and office&#13;
equipment, contractual services for internal and external audits and incremental recurrent&#13;
costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
2.33 Conditions of Loan renegotiation were: the establishment of the UGP within CATI&#13;
and the designation of the key staff of the UGP to initiate project implementation, with&#13;
qualifications and terms as outlined in the draft Implementation Manual, and acceptable to&#13;
the Bank, who were nominated under the SAA Resolution of August 19, 1997. These key&#13;
staff include the General Project Coordinator; three managers (technical, planning and&#13;
financial); and the heads of the thematic units as follows: Technology and Institutional&#13;
Development, Adaptive Research, Incentive Program, Rural Roads, Training, and&#13;
Procurement and Contracting. The IACU within CATI was established and the head of&#13;
the unit nominated by CATI's Portaria N° 12 of August 20, 1997. Assurances have been&#13;
obtained from the State Government that: (a) it will maintain a Project Administration&#13;
Unit (UEP) within CATI, with organization, structure and functions, and qualified staff, all&#13;
acceptable to the Bank; (b) an Internal Auditing and Control Unit (LACU) (para 3.2 (c);&#13;
and (c) six months after the signing of the loan, it will designate the staff to be responsible&#13;
for the two sub-units within the IACU (para. 3.2 (d)).&#13;
2.34 Each technical unit head of the UGP will be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
monitoring of its respective component. Reporting requirements, including key indicators&#13;
(physical and financial) and targets, are included in the "Project Monitoring Letter"&#13;
presented to the Bank on September 11, 1997 and described in the Implementation&#13;
Manual (Annex D, Table 1). The UGP, through the Technical Manager, will receive&#13;
monthly reports from the regions and municipalities on the key physical and financial&#13;
indicators. The Planning Manager will prepare semi-annual consolidated monitoring&#13;
summaries, conduct semi-annual project monitoring meetings and send semi-annual&#13;
reports to the Bank. These reports will include, in addition to the key indicators,&#13;
information on the following areas: (a) counterpart funds allocated by the State to the&#13;
project; (b) status of compliance with legal, financial and administrative covenants; (c)&#13;
updated implementation and disbursement schedule for the remainder of the project; (d)&#13;
financial versus physical execution of the project; (e) updated list and performance&#13;
indicators of eligible and approved microcatchment subprojects; (f) relevant environmental&#13;
information during the semester; and (g) the findings of the IACU. The Planning Manager&#13;
will also carry out ongoing project evaluation. Mid-Term and ex-post evaluations of the&#13;
project's socio-economic impact will be carried out under contract by a state university&#13;
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
2.35  As a complement to the day-to-day project monitoring, the project will also carry&#13;
out a detailed resource monitoring of, at the most, twelve microcatchments to measure&#13;
project impact. Criteria for the selection of the pilot microcatchments, as well as the&#13;
general variables that will be monitored to assess the project's ability to achieve its&#13;
objectives, are summarized in Table 2.3 and outlined in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
During the first trimester of project implementation, CATI will contact all State&#13;
Universities to explain the project strategy and the objective of the microcatchment&#13;
monitoring exercise and solicit proposals for the microcatchment monitoring to start not&#13;
later than nine months after loan signature (para. 3.2 (d) (iii)). Information on this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
exercise, together with the routine monitoring, will be the basic ingredients for the&#13;
preparation of the Mid-Term and ex-post evaluation to be contracted out to one of the&#13;
state universities, following a selection process in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
Assurances have been obtained that: (a) the progress of the implementation of the&#13;
project performance will be monitored following the indicators and targets included in the&#13;
"Project Monitoring Letter" of September 11, 1997; (b) semi-annual progress reports will&#13;
be sent to the Bank not later than three months after the end of each calendar semester;&#13;
(c) satisfactory Mid-Term and ex-post evaluation reports will be presented to the Bank for&#13;
review not later than June 30, 2001 or when disbursements from the loan account have&#13;
reached 50% of the loan amount, whichever is earlier, and six months after the Closing&#13;
Date, respectively; and (d) implementation of the microcatchment monitoring will start not&#13;
later than nine months after loan signature (para. 3.2 (e)). The "Project Monitoring&#13;
Letter" (para. 3.2 (e)) setting the indicators and targets to be used in monitoring the&#13;
progress of the implementation of the project performance was submitted to the Bank on&#13;
September 11, 1997 (para. 3.2 (e)).&#13;

E. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
2.36   State LeveL The project will be executed by SAA thorough CATI. At the state&#13;
level, the PEMBH Consultative Council (CC) was created by the Decree of July 23,1997&#13;
and includes one representative from each of the following State Secretariats: Agriculture&#13;
and Supply, Finance, Environment, Water Resources, and two representatives of the state&#13;
universities, one representative of the national Watershed Commission and eight&#13;
representatives of the CRDR, with the general project coordinator acting as its executive&#13;
secretary. The CC will have overall advisory responsibility for project policy, budgets,&#13;
institutional coordination and the integration of the proposed project with other state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
programs'2. The UGP will directly administer three project components (para. 2.32) and&#13;
liaise with CATI's executing departments and with the regional and municipal entities&#13;
responsible for executing the project. It will monitor various project activities and prepare&#13;
quarterly progress reports and consolidated financial accounts. It will also be responsible&#13;
for ensuring that project efforts are directed to the priority project areas and that the&#13;
project is executed in accordance with the Implementation Manual.&#13;
2.37  Regional LeveL CATI's Regional Manager will be responsible for coordinating&#13;
project activities at the regional level and for ensuring coordination of other projects with&#13;
the PEMBH. The technical engineering units attached to the Regional Manager will also&#13;
be trained to be gradually responsible for the implementation of the agroecological&#13;
mapping subcomponent (para. 2.13), and for the simpler road rehabilitation works (para.&#13;
2.29). The CRDR (para. 2.14) will be responsible for overseeing implementation of the&#13;
project at the regional level and for ranking the municipalities that will participate in the&#13;
project, in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Implementation Manual. They are&#13;
comprised of representatives from cooperatives, associations, agroindustries, universities&#13;
and representatives of the CMDRs (para. 2.3). The CRDRs will also be responsible for&#13;
reviewing the microcatchment management plans submitted by the CMDR.&#13;
2.38 Municipal Level. CATI senior extensionists will be responsible for motivating&#13;
the farm community to form a CMDR in each priority municipality as a prerequisite to&#13;
participating in the project, and thereafter providing technical support to the CMDR.&#13;
CATI extensionists, together with municipality and private extensionists, as the case may&#13;
be, will be responsible for assisting farmers in the preparation and implementation of the&#13;
PGM which will be the basis for any project intervention at the microcatchment level&#13;
(para. 2.10). Each CMDR will be comprised of representatives from the municipal&#13;
authorities, cooperatives, farmers' associations and other local entities (para. 2.3). The&#13;
CMDR will be responsible for selecting microcatchments for intervention, using project&#13;
criteria and reviewing microcatchment management plans, including individual or&#13;
collective requests for support under the IP.&#13;
2.39 Annual Planning and Budgeting. Targets and costs established at appraisal will&#13;
be adjusted annually during the project implementation period. In July of each year, each&#13;
technical coordination unit within the UGP will prepare an annual operating plan and&#13;
budget, detailing the physical targets, staffing, training and procurement programs, and&#13;
projected expenditures for the next calendar year, based on the budgets prepared by the&#13;
municipalities and regions. The Planning Manager, in close consultation with the Financial&#13;
Manager and the Technical Manager, will review these plans, consolidate them after&#13;
ensuring intemal consistency, and submit the consolidated operating plan and budget to&#13;
the CC for its review and appreciation. The consolidated operating plan and budget will&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26 -&#13;
be presented before September 30 of each year to the State Government for further review&#13;
and approval by the State Assembly by October 31. Assurances have been obtained&#13;
from the State Government that the project's annual operating plan and budget,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, including the physical targets, staffing, training and procurement&#13;
programs, and projected expenditures for the following year, will be made available to the&#13;
Bank by December 31 of each year (para. 3.2 (f)). A satisfactory Annual Operating Plan&#13;
for the first year of the project was submitted to the Bank shortly after negotiations.&#13;
F. PROJECT COST AND FINANcING&#13;
2.40 Project Cost. Total project costs, including taxes and duties, are estimated at&#13;
US$124.7 million with a foreign exchange component of US$17.7 million, or about 14%&#13;
of the total cost. Project baseline costs amount to US$112.50 million. The cost estimate&#13;
includes about US$13.2 million equivalent in local taxes. Physical contingencies of&#13;
US$5.2 million, or about 5% of baseline costs, include 5% estimated for all project costs&#13;
except the incentive fund. Price contingencies of US$7.0 million, or 6% of baseline costs,&#13;
are based on international inflation rates. It was assumed that periodic local currency&#13;
adjustments, estimated on a purchasing power parity basis, would compensate for&#13;
differences between the projected rates of the US dollar and local currency inflation. -A&#13;
breakdown of project costs by components and years is shown in Annex C-1.&#13;
2.41 Financing Plan. The proposed Bank loan of US$55 million equivalent will finance&#13;
49.5% of total estimated costs net of taxes and duties, or 44% of costs including taxes. The&#13;
proposed share of Bank financing is consistent with that of other projects of a similar nature in&#13;
Brazil. Local cost financing is justified because of the project's efforts to promote sustainable&#13;
agricultural production and to conserve natural resources. The Government of the State of&#13;
Sao Paulo will be the Borrower, and will assume the foreign exchange risk of the Loan. The&#13;
Federative Republic of Brazil will be the Guarantor of the Loan&#13;
2.42 Procurement The project will involve procurement of civil works, laboratory,&#13;
computer, farm, and office equipment, vehicles, consulting services, studies, and training.&#13;
Table 2.4 shows project costs broken down by proposed procurement methods.&#13;
Procurement under the project will follow the Procurement Guidelines of January 1995&#13;
and revised in January and August 1996. Standard bidding documents agreed between the&#13;
Bank and the Federal Government of Brazil for the procurement of goods and works by&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be used under the project.&#13;
2.43  In an effort to minimize potential problems, a Procurement and Contracting Unit&#13;
has been established within the UGP (para. 2.32) (Annex B, Chart 2) to coordinate and&#13;
oversee all procurement and contracting under the project. In addition, project staff of the&#13;
UGP attended a Bank-sponsored procurement seminar in May and September1997, and a&#13;
procurement seminar for additional UGP and regional project staff is scheduled to take&#13;
place at the latest during the first trimester of 1998. The project will also provide for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
additional technical assistance in the form of specialized training in procurement and in the&#13;
use of standard bidding documents in order to strengthen the capacity of the regional&#13;
offices to procure small civil works and goods under Bank procedures. The UGP will&#13;
maintain regular contact with the Administrative Units of the ongoing Bank-assisted&#13;
projects in the neighboring states of Parana and Santa Catarina and with the Federal Unit&#13;
within the Secretariat of International Affairs (SEAIN) to benefit from their procurement&#13;
experience.&#13;
2.44 Civil Works. The cost of civil works wili involve erosion control road and land&#13;
reclamation works. The aggregated value of these works is estimated at about US$32.4&#13;
million. Because of the dispersed nature and relatively small size of contracts for these&#13;
civil works, for which the largest single contract is not expected to exceed US$1.0 million,&#13;
it is unlikely that foreign contractors will be interested. Therefore, whenever feasible, civil&#13;
works will be grouped into packages of at least US$350,000 and procured through&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Total NCB&#13;
procurement for civil works is estimated at about US$22.0 million.&#13;

- 28 -&#13;
scattered to be grouped, as stated above, will be procured preferably under lump-sum,&#13;
fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three&#13;
contractors in response to a written invitation. In locations in which there is only one&#13;
contractor, direct contracting will be allowed. Where no contractor is available, works&#13;
will be carried out under force account. Such expenditures will not be financed by the&#13;
Bank loan. The adoption of force account procedure for a small portion of the works to&#13;
be undertaken by Municipal Governments is not expected to affect the cost of works due&#13;
to the project's training strategy which includes initial training for these entities and for the&#13;
participatory microcatchment approach, which gives farmers incentives to procure cost&#13;
savings in order to expand their respective microcatchment road rehabilitation plans. It is&#13;
estimated that such expenditures will be equivalent to 10% of the cost of civil works, or&#13;
about US$ 3.2 million.&#13;
2.46 Goods. Goods costing more than US$350,000 per contract, and specialized&#13;
research equipment, computer equipment and software will be awarded through&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines.&#13;
Office and farm equipment, and other goods required over the project implementation&#13;
period, not exceeding US$13.3 million in aggregate and costing less than US$350,000 per&#13;
contract, will be procured in packages of a minimum US$100,000 under NCB procedures&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. Foreign suppliers wishing to participate in bidding for NCB&#13;
contracts will be allowed to do so in accordance with local procedures. Miscellaneous&#13;
office equipment, furniture, seeds and seedlings and other similar goods estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$100,000 per contract, and not exceeding US$2.4 million in aggregate, will&#13;
be awarded through national shopping in accordance with procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
2.47 Community Contracting. Procurement of goods and works for grants under the&#13;
Incentive Program, 3 costing less than US$50,000 per project and procured by local&#13;
microcatchment farmers, will be carried out mainly through direct contracting and national&#13;
shopping. This procurement procedure is appropriate because activities financed by the&#13;
Incentive Program: (a) will be small and/or implemented in scattered or remote areas and&#13;
therefore it will be difficult to obtain competitive proposals; (b) can be managed directly&#13;
by microcatchment farmers who will contribute to the activities with labor and/or local&#13;
materials; and (c) are essential to project sustainability and, as such, local farmers should&#13;
participate fully in their implementation.&#13;
2.48 Consultants. Consultant services for technical assistance and studies will be&#13;
contracted in accordance with the January 1997 "Bank Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants." Foreign consultants will not be subject to prior registration as a condition&#13;
of their participation in the selection process. Consulting services for internal and external&#13;
audits, for engineering design and supervision and for agro-ecological mapping are&#13;
13 The value of the grants may reach up to the equivalent of US$3,000 per beneficiary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract and will be awarded on a&#13;
least-cost basis. Proposals for the contracting of applied research tasks, estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$100,000 per contract, will be contracted using a fixed cost budget. Other&#13;
consulting services will be contracted following quality- and cost-based procedures. For&#13;
consultants' contracts not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent each for individual consultants&#13;
and US$100,000 equivalent each for consulting firms, the Bank's prior review will cover&#13;
only terms of reference.&#13;
2.49 Bank Review Requirements. Prior Bank review of bidding documents, bid&#13;
evaluations, award proposals and final contracts will be required for: civil works contracts&#13;
estimated to cost more than US$350,000; all ICB contracts and the NCB contract for&#13;
goods costing more than US$100,000 per contract; and consultants' contracts for more&#13;
than US$50,000 for individuals and US$100,000 for consulting firms. Due to the small,&#13;
demand-driven nature of the contracts, prior Bank review is expected to cover about 40%&#13;
of the value of contracts subject to procurement financed under the project. However, the&#13;
IACU to be created under the General Coordinator of CATI (para. 2.32) and the project&#13;
supervision plan (Annex D, Table D2) will emphasize review of procedures and internal&#13;
control by different departments and regions while it will also include post-award reviews&#13;
at a ratio of not less than one review to every ten contracts. Assurances have been&#13;
obtained from the State Government that the standard bidding documents for the&#13;
procurement of goods and works will be used and that the above procurement&#13;
arrangements will be followed (para. 3.2 (g)).&#13;
2.50  Disbursements and Special Account. In accordance with the standard Bank&#13;
profile for similar types of projects, disbursements are expected to occur over about six&#13;
and a half years as shown in the estimated disbursement schedule. The project completion&#13;
date will be December 31, 2003 and the project Closing Date June 30, 2004. The&#13;
proceeds of the US$55.0 million loan equivalent will be disbursed as follows: (a) 55% of&#13;
expenditures on civil works; (b) 70% of project expenditures made under the IP; (c) 100%&#13;
of all foreign expenditures and 65% of local expenditures for purchases of eligible goods&#13;
including purchases of seedlings for land development; (d) 100% of expenditures for&#13;
consultants; and (e) 55% of expenditures for training services. Disbursements for civil&#13;
works contracts not exceeding US$350,000, contracts for goods and equipment not&#13;
exceeding US$100,000, contracts for individual consultants not exceeding US$50,000 and&#13;
for consulting firms not exceeding US$100,000, land development under the conservation&#13;
reforestation and the incentive for recovery of degraded lands subcomponents and grants&#13;
under the Incentive Program will be made against Statements of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) prepared by the UGP. With the exception of the terms of reference for consultant&#13;
services, supporting documentation for such expenditures will not be submitted to the&#13;
Bank but will be available for inspection by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
2.51  In order to reduce the interval during which the State of Sao Paulo will finance the&#13;
Bank's share of project costs with its own resources, a Special Account will be established&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30 -&#13;
in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank with an initial deposit of US$2.0 million and&#13;
a maximum of US$4.0 million once loan disbursements have reached US$8.0 million.&#13;
Withdrawals from the Special Account will be supported by the required documentation&#13;
or Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). The Bank will replenish the Special Account for&#13;
the amount of withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures at the request of SAA. To&#13;
enable project executing agencies to accelerate ongoing start-up activities, particularly training&#13;
and project dissemination, project expenditures incurred twelve months before loan signing will&#13;
be eligible for reimbursement up to US$2.5 million equivalent, or 4.5% of the loan amount. A&#13;
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan is shown in Annex C-12.&#13;
2.52 Accounts and Auditing. The financial, budgeting, accounting and internal&#13;
controls of CATI were assessed by the Bank prior to negotiations. CATI foliows the&#13;
"Integrated System of Financial Administration for the State of Sao Paulo's accounts and&#13;
its municipalities" which was found satisfactory to record project accounts. However, due&#13;
to identified shortcomings of qualified staff in the areas of financial and accounting&#13;
matters, the project provides for a financial unit to be staffed with qualified personnel&#13;
within the UGP. It also includes intensive training in financial matters during the first&#13;
semester of 1998. In addition, an IACU attached to the General Coordinator of CATI has&#13;
also been established under the project (para. 2.32). CATI will maintain separate accounts&#13;
for project expenditures which will be consolidated by the UGP. Through its IACU, it&#13;
will have work sites, engineering and environmental components of the project, as well as&#13;
the procurement and contracting processes and the related technical documentation (e.g.,&#13;
bidding documents, contracts, engineering designs and other engineering documents)&#13;
audited each year in accordance with* internationally acceptable engineering and&#13;
environmental standards and as stipulated in the Terms of Reference included in the&#13;
Implementation Manual. In addition, the project accounts and the Special Account to be&#13;
opened in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank will be audited annually by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank under terms of reference acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The terms of reference of external audits are included in the Implementation&#13;
Manual. An engineering and environmental audit report to be carried out by independent&#13;
auditors, based on terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, will be submitted to the&#13;
Bank by June 30, 2001 or when disbursements from the loan account have reached 50%&#13;
of the loan amount, in conjunction with the mid-term review. After the audit, and not&#13;
later than six months after the close of the fiscal year, SAA will transmit certified copies of&#13;
the audited accounts, together with certified copies of the auditors' reports, to the Bank.&#13;
2.53  Statements of project accounts will be consolidated by and retained in the UGP&#13;
office and made available for Bank supervision. For the annual audits of project accounts,&#13;
the independent auditors will test-check the preparation of the SOEs, supporting&#13;
disbursement requests, the internal controls of project transactions and the implementation&#13;
of these controls, the supporting evidence for the expenditures and the eligibility of the&#13;
expenses in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The audit report will include a&#13;
description of the audit procedures followed and convey the auditor's opinion and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31 -&#13;
comments as necessary on the methodology employed in the compilation of the SOEs,&#13;
their accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents and standards of record keeping&#13;
and internal controls of project transactions. The separate project accounts maintained by&#13;
the executing agencies will be available for review and spot-checked by the Bank during&#13;
supervision. An outline of the terms of reference for the annual audits is included in the&#13;
Implementation Manual.&#13;
2.54 Assurances have been obtained from the State Government that: (a) the&#13;
Special Account and the project accounts will be maintained and audited annually by&#13;
independent auditors according to standards and procedures satisfactory to the Bank;&#13;
(b) terms of reference for the auditors will include, inter alia, detailed procedures for the&#13;
examination and verification of the SOEs for the project accounts; (c) certified copies of&#13;
the audited accounts and of the auditors' reports will be submitted to the Bank within six&#13;
months of the close of each fiscal year; and (d) an engineering and environmental audit&#13;
report prepared by independent auditors under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
will be submitted to the Bank by June 30, 2001 or when disbursements from the loan&#13;
account have reached 50% of the loan amount, in conjunction with the mid-term&#13;
evaluation (para. 3.2 (h)).&#13;
G. PROJECT BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
2.55  The proposed project is expected to make a notable contribution to natural&#13;
resource management and conservation by facilitating the introduction of soil and water&#13;
conservation practices at the microcatchment level. Benefits under the proposed project&#13;
are expected from increased agricultural production through sustainable productivity gains&#13;
and improved land use. In addition, the strong reduction of soil erosion, pollution of&#13;
water resources, sedimentation of river beds and silting of reservoirs, as well as a lower&#13;
risk of flooding, will benefit society at large. Externalities related to sedimentation, water&#13;
quality and soil erosion will be monitored and evaluated in about 12 microcatchment pilot&#13;
areas under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.35). Based on the results&#13;
of this monitoring and on the Mid-Term evaluation, project activities will be adjusted as&#13;
needed.&#13;
2.56 Production and Farm Incomes. Within the approximate 4.5 million ha of&#13;
farmland covered by the 1,500 microcatchments of the project area, about 1.17 million ha&#13;
(or about 24.5 % of the project area) are expected to fully benefit from improved land&#13;
management and soil conservation practices and some commercial reforestation. Benefits&#13;
are based in the adoption rates of the recommended practices as shown in Annex C, Table&#13;
C.9 and based on the available technical packages, the proposed technical strategy (Annex&#13;
B) and informal surveys carried out by CATI. They are also consistent with the adoption&#13;
rates observed in the ongoing land management projects (paras. 1.7-1.8).  These&#13;
developments, valued on a per ha of commodity basis, are expected to lead at full&#13;
development (Year 10-11) to an annual incremental output value of US$300 million. Fifty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
percent of this amount will come from increased productivity of coffee, 41% from the four&#13;
other major crops (cotton, maize, soybeans and beans) and 9% from improved milk and&#13;
beef production.  The incremental production will be marketed through existing&#13;
commercial channels; local markets are expected to absorb maize, beans and wheat, while&#13;
soybean and cotton will be exported. These expanded agricultural activities will also&#13;
create new on-farm employment opportunities equivalent to about 5,000 man-years&#13;
annually.&#13;
2.57 Eight farm models representative of the major regions and project priority areas&#13;
have been selected to test the financial impact of the improved land management practices&#13;
on farm incomes. The analysis shows financial rates of return ranging from 13% to 40%.&#13;
At full development, net annual farm benefits from the main crops, which currently vary&#13;
from US$2,700 to US$11,700, will increase to a range of US$3,400 to US$20,800.&#13;
2.58 Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery. The economic activities generated by the&#13;
proposed project are expected to provide the State of Sao Paulo with additional fiscal&#13;
revenues of about US$25.0 million and US$50.0 million by years 6 and 10, respectively,&#13;
generated by the federal tax on the circulation of goods (ICMS) that will apply to the&#13;
incremental marketable production, and will be retained by the State Treasury. In&#13;
addition, based on experience in similar projects (para 1.7), the maintenance cost of&#13;
rehabilitated roads is expected to decrease by as much as 50%, while the cost of water&#13;
treatment due to reduced water turbidity is also expected to decrease. Finally, subsidies&#13;
for soil conservation subprojects are expected to be gradually reduced and completely&#13;
phased out by project end.&#13;
2.59 Economic Analysis. The economic rate of return for the project has been&#13;
estimated at 20%. The economic costs include all project investment and operating costs&#13;
and on-farm costs, estimated on a per-hectare basis for the main commodities, resulting&#13;
from the adoption of improved land management and soil conservation practices on&#13;
1,170,000 ha of farmland (as a result of the adoption rates as defined Annex C). The cost&#13;
and benefit streams are detailed in Annex C. Sensitivity tests show that the rate is&#13;
moderately sensitive to variations in project costs and benefits or delays in achieving&#13;
project results. With a 10% rise in project cost or a 10% fall in project benefits, the rate&#13;
will be about 12%, while a one-year delay in achieving project results will reduce the rate&#13;
of return to 14.5%, still above the estimated opportunity cost of capital.&#13;
2.60 Environmental Impact. The project's environmental category is B. The project is&#13;
expected to have a significant beneficial impact on the environment by promoting the control of&#13;
soil erosion and water pollution and other conservation activities at the niicrocatchment area&#13;
level, including a progressive reversion to forest cover of areas not suitable for agricultural or&#13;
livestock development. Environmental externalities from project activities will be monitored&#13;
under the project in 12 microcatchments. All road rehabilitation works to be financed under&#13;
the project will consist of erosion control works on rural roads, designed to decrease erosion as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33 -&#13;
an integral part of the microcatchment area Development Plan, and therefore will contibute&#13;
positively to the project's environmental impact. Road realignments, in particular, will occur&#13;
only in areas so severely affected by soil erosion that the positive impact from mitigating&#13;
erosion damage outweighs any temporary negative impact of project intervention during the&#13;
construction process. Nevertheless, to identify and amend any possible negative impact during&#13;
construction, the Project Implementation Manual contains specific environmental guidelines,&#13;
including careful supervision of works and strong community involvement in the road&#13;
rehabilitation program, and the need to seek environmental clearance for the Microcatchment&#13;
Development Plan. The Project will create the capacity to recognize and respond to conflicts&#13;
over resource use, thereby promoting the use of State land in accordance with its agro-&#13;
ecological potential.&#13;
2.61 Poverty Category. The proposed project is part of the Bank's Program of Targeted&#13;
Interventions. Consistent with the Bank's poverty reduction efforts, the proposed project aims&#13;
at increasing small- and medium-scale farmers' productivity while promoting sound natural&#13;
resource management practices. A significant number of small farmers are located in less&#13;
productive areas and zones with high susceplubility to erosion. This fact, together with&#13;
inadequate natural resource management practices, particularly those resulting in soil&#13;
degradation, has tended to reduce farm income and increase its variability. The project will&#13;
center its activities in areas with the highest susceptibility to soil erosion and highest&#13;
concentration of small-scale- farmers and poverty (para. 2.3). The incentive program to&#13;
encourage adoption of key conservation practices will be specifically targeted to small- and&#13;
medium-scale farmers to help them overcome the constraint of inital high cost of conservation&#13;
investments and ensure that they participate in the benefits generated by improved conservation&#13;
practices at the microcatchment level.&#13;
H. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
2.62 The principal risks are: (a) the reluctance of the fanning community to invest in&#13;
conservation techniques, given the perception of delayed direct benefits, the high inital cost of&#13;
the recommended practices, and the need for collective action at the microcatchment level; (b)&#13;
the potential delay in implementation of some project activities due to prolonged preparation of&#13;
project inputs and start-p activities; (c) the potential for delays and shortfalls in counterpart&#13;
funding due to insufficient political support; and (d) limited institutional capacity. The overall&#13;
participatory nature of the project should create awareness among farmers of the need for, and&#13;
benefits of collective action in soil erosion control and other conservation and management&#13;
techniques and encourage farmers to invest in these activities. In addition, the establishment of&#13;
an Icentive Program to partially finance various key conservation and pollution control&#13;
activities will help small- and medium-size farmers to overcome the constraint of initial high&#13;
cost and demonstrate the benefits of the proposed strategy Moreover, expenence from the&#13;
Bank-financed Land Management I (Parani) and II (Santa Catarina) Projects suggests that an&#13;
early dissemination of project concept, activities and results, as reflected in the proposed&#13;
project's dissemination program, increases the involvement of the fanming community in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
project. This involvement, in turn, generates local ownership and vocalized demand for&#13;
government funding from the grassroots level, thereby achieving awareness and support from&#13;
higher political levels. Key start-up activities and training of extensionists will begin as soon as&#13;
the project has been negotiated to minimize the risk of disruption in the subsequent&#13;
implementation of integrated activities. The Project Implementation Manual will establish the&#13;
necessary sequencing of project activities to ensure their timely implementation. In addition,&#13;
the project's annual operating plans, budget reviews and reporting procedures should provide&#13;
an early warming to minuize the risk of insufficient funding. Finally, the project will build upon&#13;
the institutional capacity generated from previous state initiatives (para. 1.18) and expand it&#13;
incrementally. As the implementation agency gains experience in initial project municipalities,&#13;
they will gradually increase their responsibilities and extend coverage of project activities to the&#13;
remaining project area. Moreover, the introduction of a strong monitoring system at the State&#13;
and local levels, and a well-designed training program which includes substantial technical and&#13;
administrative training for the CMDR, CRDR and local extensionists, should ensure efficient&#13;
inter-institutional coordination and execution.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
LAND MANAGEMENT m PROJECT&#13;
Sao Paulo Strategy for Improved Non-Rural Resource Management&#13;
A. Area of Project Intervention&#13;
1.    Introduction. During the 1970s, Sao Paulo's agriculture underwent a major transformation stemming&#13;
from a combined process of accelerated urbanization associated with the implementation of an agroindustrial&#13;
complex. The latter aimed at promoting production of manufactured goods and agricultural inputs and&#13;
machinery equipment, which facilitated large-scale agricultural development aimed at meeting growing&#13;
domestic and foreign demand. This transformation was also strongly influenced by agricultural policies which&#13;
substantially subsidized the mechanization process, the use of agrochemicals, and the opening of new&#13;
agricultural lands mainly through subsidized credit. This process, which was characterized by increased use of&#13;
agrochemicals and accelerated mechanization, brought about an accelerated process of soil erosion and&#13;
chemical pollution which is seriously affecting the availability and quality of the water resources in a number&#13;
of areas, in particular the western part of the state.&#13;
2.    The most significant type of natural resource degradation in rural Sao Paulo is a combination of water-&#13;
induced soil erosion and increased pollution of water sources as a result of uncontrolled water runoff, animal&#13;
waste and toxic waste dumping. These problems result from extensive deforestation, inappropriate land use,&#13;
poor soil management and inadequate road designs. Highly erosive tropical rainfall on bare soil detaches&#13;
small soil particles which clog soil pores and seal the surface (rainsplash effect). Rain is lost as surface runoff&#13;
carries away soil particles and causes sheet and gully erosion damage, silting of river beds and flooding.&#13;
3.    Concern about these problems led the state government to launch a pilot study' in 1986 to map&#13;
erosion risk in the watershed of the Peixe-Paranapanema River, which covers about one-third of the state&#13;
area, and evaluate erosion damage and its impact on the entire region. The alarming result of this study&#13;
encouraged the state to take a number of policy actions to address this issue, including the creation in 1997 of&#13;
the Water Resources Council2, which established the conditions for a decentralized State Water Resources&#13;
Management System to better address the natural resource management problems affecting the watersheds.&#13;
4.    However, results up to now have not been encouraging. It is estimated that about 80% of the&#13;
cultivated area of the state still presents soil erosion problems, substantially above the technically tolerable&#13;
levels. Therefore, it is estimated that about 194 million tons of topsoil are lost annually with about 50 million&#13;
tons reaching the watercourses, causing sedimentation and contamination of watersheds3 These problems are&#13;
more acute in certain areas of the state, such as the western region which is the most intensively cultivated&#13;
area on sedimentary and sandstone-derived soil. It is also the area with the highest concentration of poverty&#13;
in the state.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

5.    State intervention is justified to induce adoption of improved natural resource management practices&#13;
aimed at achieving a development strategy based on rational use of soil and water. However, the search for&#13;
sustainability also calls for a planned and rational intervention, focusing efforts and resources on programs&#13;
with permanent and multiplying effects. A State program addressing the above-mentioned aspects will need&#13;
to be based in the watershed which is a well-defined geographic unit with interdependent relations and forces.&#13;
However, experience has demonstrated that changes in rural behavior should be initiated with fewer farmers,&#13;
with basic activities and proper technologies, in small areas, and using readily available resources to obtain&#13;
results in the short-term. On a limited scale --at the microcatchment level (microbacia hidrografica), the&#13;
drainage area of a small tributary in a given watershed-- it will be easier to obtain concrete and visible results&#13;
with substantial impact to the farming community on a sustainable basis.&#13;
6.    Within this context, the project would cover an area of about 4.5 million hectares and will use the&#13;
microcatchment (microbacia hidrogrdfica) as the planning and implementation unit. The microcatchment-&#13;
centered strategy has proven to be very efficient in similar natural resources management projects in Parana&#13;
and Santa Catarina, particularly for the implementation of collectively planned activities such as the&#13;
construction of physical barriers and realignment of feeder roads to control excess runoff; for the recovery of&#13;
galery forests to protect water courses; and for the establishment of water pollution control measures&#13;
including water supply structures for pesticide management and agrotoxic waste disposal set-ups. Moreover,&#13;
farmers organized around microcatchments have facilitated the introduction of improved natural resources&#13;
management practices promoted by extensionists, and the monitoring and enforcement of environmental laws,&#13;
in particular those related to soil, water and forest cover. By working at the grassroots level, it will also&#13;
facilitate the implementation of more participatory watershed committees consistent with state policies.&#13;
Selection of Priority Regions&#13;
7.    While the project would encompass the entire state, the area of direct project intervention would equal&#13;
about 30% of the total state farmland, but about 50% of the area is classified as high priority. The&#13;
demonstration effect of project activities in the project area, which would be spread geographically across the&#13;
state, is expected to induce the adoption of the project-supported natural resource management approach in&#13;
the state's remaining farmland. The project will focus its efforts on highly eroded areas or those highly&#13;
susceptible to erosion which at the same time present the highest concentration of poverty. To that end, the&#13;
40 EDR, which are homogeneous agricultural regions, have been ranked from one to three, based on two&#13;
factors: susceptibility to soil erosion and concentration of poverty, as follows.&#13;
8.    Susceptibility to Soil Erosion. Based on the technical survey carried out by the Technological&#13;
Research Institute in 1992, as a basis for the formulation of the project, susceptibility to soil erosion was&#13;
defined on three levels, taking into account the combination of the following factors: (a) potential erosion as&#13;
the combination of rain erosivity, soil erodibility and soil declivity; (b) expectation of soil degradation&#13;
measured as the combination of potential erosion, level of mechanization and use of heavy disc plow and lack&#13;
of soil cover during critical periods; (c) current level of soil erosion; (d) land use; (e) level of farmers' response&#13;
to the pilot program; and (f) existing concentration of small- and medium-scale farmers.4  Each of these&#13;
factors was ranked from one to five for each EDR and, based on the total points, then regrouped into three&#13;
categories as follows.&#13;

9.    Poverty. Based on information extracted from "Conjuntura Alimentiria" prepared by SAA, from&#13;
information in the "Mapa da Fome" prepared by the Instituto de Pesquisa Aplicada, each of the 40 EDRs was&#13;
also ranked on three levels, depending on the concentration of poverty, the latter being defined as those&#13;
families with family earnings of less than two basic salaries per month.. The ranking of this coefficient is&#13;
shown in the foliowing table:&#13;

3                            less than 10%o&#13;
10.   Combined Soil Erosion and Poverty Criteria. Based on the above-mentioned erosion and poverty&#13;
coefficients, areas for project intervention were ranked as high "1", medium "2" and low "3" by combining&#13;
these two criteria (Table B.1). Because the Project's main objective is to improve natural resource&#13;
management, highest priority in the ranking process was given to susceptibility to the soil erosion coefficient&#13;
rather than to poverty concentration. Table B.2 shows the ranking regrouped on the three levels of priority&#13;
for project intervention.&#13;
11.   About 70%/o of project resources wili be concentrated in areas with the highest priority, 27% in areas&#13;
with medium-level priority, and about 3% in areas with low pnority. The estimated number of&#13;
microcatchments per priority area is presented in the following table:&#13;

12.   The participatory strategy of the Project underlines the need to implement the project on the basis of&#13;
microcatchments as geomorphological and socio-economic units covering areas ranging from 1,500 to 5,000&#13;
ha (average of 3,000 ha) and grouping about 40 to 90 farmers (average of 60 farmers), with substantial&#13;
participation of the rural community. Therefore, municipalities and microcatchments that would finally&#13;
participate in the project will be selected as follows.&#13;
Criteria for the Selection of the Municipalities and Microcatchments&#13;
13. Municipalities: Selection of municipalities within a particular region will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Regional Rural Development Council (CRDRs), established by State Decree N° 41.718 dated April 16, 1997,&#13;
based on the following criteria. First, municipalities should meet the following two prerequisites:&#13;
*  To have a Municipal Rural Development Council (CMDR) with representatives of the various segments of&#13;
the municipal agriculture sector in accordance with Decree N° 40.103 of May 25, 1996; and&#13;
* To have formalized an agreement with SSA specifying, inter alia, its commitment to implement the&#13;
project in accordance with the PEMBH Implementation Manual, including the maintenance of roads to be&#13;
rehabilitated under the Project.&#13;
Having fuilflled the above prerequisites, the CRDR will apply the following parameters and weights to select&#13;
the municipalities that will participate in the project. The municipality with the highest number of points will&#13;
be the one selected to participate in the project.&#13;

15.     Microcatchments will be ranked based  on the points obtained after the application of the above-&#13;
mentioned criteria. Microcatchments with the highest number of points will be the ones selected.&#13;
iMicrocatchments with fewer than 65% of small farmers will receive zero points under criteria (2).&#13;
B. Technical Strategy&#13;
16.     The proposed natural resources management strategy would address the problem  of water-induced&#13;
soil erosion in the aforementioned project area by pursuing three objectives: (a) minimize rainsplash effect by&#13;
protecting the soil surface from disintegration and sealing; (b) minimize excess runoff by maximizing the rate&#13;
and amount of infiltration; and (c) minimize the ability of water runoff to flow and form gullies by limiting its&#13;
accumulation and velocity.&#13;

17.   These objectives can be met over time with efforts to adjust land use to land capability. Therefore,&#13;
several land management and soil conservation techniques are readily available and would be promoted by the&#13;
project (Table B-3). First, to minimize both the rainsplash effect and excess runoff, the project-supported&#13;
strategy would encourage minimum- or no-tillage practices associated with deep ripping, liming and adequate&#13;
fertilization. The project woul further stimulate crop biomass production and productivity, crop&#13;
diversification and cropping rotations. The latter would include green manure crops, selected seeds,&#13;
intensified crop density and improved use of crop residues. Windbreaks to reduce surface evaporation,&#13;
adequate pasture, improved herd management, and the use of low-cost vegetative contour barriers (using&#13;
fodder crops such as elephant grass, fodder cane, phalaris or more specialized erosion-control plants such as&#13;
vetiver grass) would also be promoted. Although these practices would result in quick yield improvements&#13;
and attractive financial returns, the initial investment can be quite large and discouraging, particularly to small&#13;
farmers, and thus it is essential for the project to promote a rapid adoption of these modem land management&#13;
techniques. The above strategy would be complemented with improved handling and disposal of agro-&#13;
chemicals and animal waste to reduce water pollution.&#13;
18.   To achieve the third objective of the technical strategy, i.e., to minimize water surface runoffs ability&#13;
to form gullies, efforts would be centered on constructing structures such as bunds, terraces and improved&#13;
drainage along rural roads. Since the handling of excessive runoff implies a collectively agreed control plan,&#13;
the success of the technical strategy would depend on the involvement of all land users within a&#13;
microcatchment (microbacia hidrografica). Finally, conservation reforestation would be encouraged along&#13;
water courses, in steeper areas, and in shallow or fragile soils unsuitable for agriculture.&#13;
19.   The project's technical strategy is based on a fairly well-known, although not yet widely used, set of&#13;
land management practices (Table B. 3). The choice of the most suitable techniques for a microcatchment&#13;
and/or farm would depend on its particular situation, esp_cially on the intensities of capital and labor used in&#13;
the particular fanming system. The project's technical strategy is detailed in the Implementation Manual,&#13;
prepared by CATI with the collaboration of research institutes, universities, and progressive farmers.&#13;
20.   Prior to any project intervention, each selected project municipality would enter into an agreement&#13;
with SAA specifying, inter alia, the need to implement the program in accordance with the Implementation&#13;
Manual, including maintenance of roads rehabilitated under the project, and to monitor implementation of&#13;
improved natural resource management practices at the microcatchment level. The CMDR would be&#13;
composed of representatives of the municipal government and local institutions concemed with the rural&#13;
sector (e.g., cooperatives, banks, associations, labor unions, agricultural research and extension institutions,&#13;
environmental institutions and representatives of the microcatchment associations). Microcatchments within&#13;
each municipality to be benefited under the project would be selected by the CMRD, assisted by the extension&#13;
service, based on the criteria outlined above.&#13;
C. Operational Strategy&#13;
21.   Land users within a selected microcatchment will be encouraged to form producers' associations or to&#13;
associate with existing ones. Assisted by the local extensionist, the microcatchment beneficiaries will&#13;
formalize their priorities and plan the required collective land and water management activities which would&#13;
be summarized in a Microcatchment Development Plan (PGM)." Coordinated by the extension agent, the&#13;
1I PGM Pano Glbl da Micobacins&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
PGM would be based on a socio-economic participatory survey of the microcatchment and the agroecological&#13;
maps to be produced under the project, and would identify the main sources of natural resource degradation&#13;
and infrastructure problems to be addressed under the project. The PGM would describe and map on- and&#13;
off-farm agronomic and environmental problems, and the proposed interventions with detailed cost estimates&#13;
specifying the major on- and off-farm constraints to be handled collectively.&#13;
22.   The implementation of on-farm conservation practices would follow an individual farm land-use plan,&#13;
PIP (plano individual de propriedades), to be prepared by the extension agent in close collaboration with&#13;
each individual farmer. A PIP would include: (a) schematic farm maps showing: (i) present land use; (ii)&#13;
potential land use; and (iii) planned actions to reconcile land use conflicts; and (b) a description of the land use&#13;
changes and soil conservation practices to be introduced under the project, including timetable, estimated&#13;
costs and expected yields and revenues. A number of PIPs may generate a plan for collective activities (PEC -&#13;
piano de empreendimentos coletivos). PIPs and PECs, as well as the contracts, would entitle farmers to. apply&#13;
for financial incentives foreseen under the project to induce implementation of most critical individual and&#13;
collective activities (Tables B.4-B.5). PIPs for small farmers would be prepared by the public extension&#13;
service (CATI and municipal extensionists) or by project-financed private extension services. Medium and&#13;
large farmers within the assisted microcatchment would be encouraged to contract their PIPs with private,&#13;
authorized technical assistance. The planning methodology of the PGM, PIPs and PECs, as well as the&#13;
contracts to be signed between the SAA and the farmers to benefit from project incentives, are included in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;

LAND MANAGEMENT m PROJECT&#13;
Financial and Economic Benefits&#13;
A. Financial Benefits&#13;
1.    Six rainfed farm models, representative of the eight agricultural regions (DIRAs) with&#13;
major concentration of microcatchments (Regions 1 through 8), were analyzed to test the&#13;
impact of improved land management and soil conservation practices on the yield of major&#13;
crops (Table C. 8). Five of the models are small-scale farms: two fully mechanized (System&#13;
C) -- one with soybeans and maize, and winter wheat cropping, and the other with soybeans,&#13;
cotton and maize; three models (one of which is a medium-scale farm) are characterized by&#13;
mixed farming resulting from the combination of coffee and maize or cotton and maize&#13;
production (System B) with milk or beef cattle. Finally, the last small-scale farm represents&#13;
the typical association of maize with double-cropped beans. The illustrative models take into&#13;
account aRl improved land management and pollution control practices that would be&#13;
gradually adopted by the farmers (linear increase in productivity varying from 11 to 150%&#13;
over 5 to 7 years in the "with project" situation). The financial rates of return before financing&#13;
and subsidies range from 13 to 40%. The projected increases in crop yields under the various&#13;
farming systems range from 11 to 150% for grains, cotton and coffee, to 66-100% for milk&#13;
and beef production as shown in Table C.8.&#13;
2.    The increased productivity would result from the adoption of land management&#13;
practices adapted to each farming system as follows: (a) System B, a combination of contour&#13;
fanning and strip-cropping, low-cost vegetative contour barriers with reduced tillage, liming,&#13;
inclusion of winter (and, where feasible, summer) green manuring in crop rotation, improved&#13;
use of agro-chemicals and some reforestation; and (b) System C, a combination of contour&#13;
fanning and strip-cropping, bunding and/or terracing with reduced tillage, inclusion of winter&#13;
(or summer) green manuring in crop rotation, and improved use of agro-chemicals.&#13;
Substantial on-farm savings are expected to result from the adoption of improved land&#13;
preparation (reduced tillage through the elimination of heavy disc plowing combined with the&#13;
periodical use of deep rippers) and fertilizing (reduced use of chemical fertilizers combined&#13;
with increased green manuring and improved use of crop residues). In the case of dairy farm&#13;
and beef cattle farm models, increased milk and beef productivity is expected from the&#13;
combination of pasture rehabilitation, through proper crop/pasture rotation, with increased&#13;
area planted to forage and improved animal husbandry. For a summary of land management&#13;
practices, see Tables C. 1 through C.7. Details of recommended practices for each crop and&#13;
farm model are available in the project file. Adoption rates of land management technologies&#13;
are shown in Table C.9. Net annual farm benefits from the main crops, which currently vary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
between US$2,700 and US$11,700, would increase, at full development (Year 10-11), to a&#13;
range of US$3,400 to US$20,800.&#13;
3.    Within the 4.5 million ha of farmland approximately covered by the 1,500&#13;
microcatchments in the project area, about 1.17 million ha (21% of area currently under&#13;
annual crops, 6% of area under perennial crops and 41% of area under pasture) are expected&#13;
to fully benefit from improved land management and soil conservation practices and some&#13;
commercial reforestation. These developments, valued on a per ha of commodity basis, are&#13;
expected to lead at full development (Year 10-11) to an annual incremental output value of&#13;
US$300 million. Fifty percent of this amount would come from increased productivity of&#13;
coffee, 41% from the four other major crops (cotton, maize, soybeans and beans) and 9%&#13;
from improved milk and beef production. These expanded agricultural activities would also&#13;
create new on-farm employment opportunities equivalent to about 5,000 man-years annually.&#13;
4.   In addition to the above incremental production and employment opportunities, the&#13;
project is expected to generate other substantial benefits such as: (a) reduced maintenance&#13;
costs of microcatchment rural roads; (b) reduced water treatment cost; (c) reduced&#13;
sedimentation and silting of river beds and reservoirs; and (d) reduced flooding.&#13;
B. Economic Analysis and Sensitivity&#13;
5.    The overall rate of return of the project is estimated to be 19% over a 20-year period&#13;
(Table C. 11). The cost stream for the economic analysis is based on four elements: (a) all on-&#13;
farm investment and operating costs, valued on a per hectare of commodity basis, for the&#13;
development of 1.17 million ha of farmland resulting from the adoption rates outlined in para.&#13;
3; (b) all project costs except those related to the soil conservation (SC) fund (already&#13;
included in on-farm investments) and the conservation reforestation; (c) estimated incremental&#13;
costs for private extension (cooperatives); and (d) incremental recurrent costs after project&#13;
completion reduced by 50%/0 from Year 10 on.&#13;
6.   Incremental net benefits were estimated on a per hectare basis of commodities&#13;
produced on about 1.17 million ha of farmland expected to fully benefit from improved land&#13;
management and soil conservation practices and some commercial reforestation in the 1,500&#13;
project microcatchments.&#13;
7.    Economic prices (Table C. 10) at the farmgate were derived from the main trade&#13;
goods, including soybeans, wheat, maize, cotton, coffee and chemical fertilizers, taking into&#13;
account international trade prices, freight, insurance, port handling, marketing, transport and&#13;
processing costs with price trends projected according to those estimated by the Bank's&#13;
International Commodity Markets Division at 1997 constant prices. Permanent farm labor&#13;
was applied a specific conversion factor of 0.4 to eliminate transfer payments (in particular,&#13;
new social security rates), and all other outputs and inputs were adjusted by the standard&#13;
conversion factor (0.9) to account for domestic price distortions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
8.    Sensitivity tests (Table C. 12) show that the rate of return is moderately insensitive to&#13;
either possible variations in costs and benefits or delays in achieving project res.  If&#13;
benefits fail by 10%, or project costs rise by 10%, the rate of return would stil be 14%. A&#13;
one-year lag in achieving project results would reduce the rate of return to 13.5, still above&#13;
the estimated opportunity cost of capital.&#13;

            Brazil - State of Sao Paulo Third Land
            Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Building on the model developed for
            previous projects in this series and on Brazil's pilot
            experience in the State Program of Microcatchments (PEMBH),
            the Third Land Management Project will promote the adoption
            of integrated measures for natural resource management and
            conservation, using the microcatchment area as the unit for
            participatory planning, monitoring, and collective
            implementation. The project is composed of six components:
            1)a technology and institutional development component,
            consisting of: a) rural extension encouraging a new form of
            agricultural extension that modifies the current
            product-focused extension, towards one focused on the
            microcatchment productivity systems in which families and
            rural communities actively participate; b) rural
            associations which have financed selective administrative
            and managerial equipment and consultant services; and c)
            agro-ecological mapping at the microcatchment level in soil
            classification and land use planning, and resource
            information; 2) an adaptive agricultural research component,
            which finances of specialized services, infrastructure,
            field equipment, and inputs for research trials, and
            incremental operating costs;  3) an incentive program for
            natural resources management and conservation component,
            which finances: environmental education, an incentives fund
            for soil management and conservation and pollution control,
            an incentive for recovery of degraded lands, reforestation,
            and enforcement of the soil use law and of project
            incentives; 4) an erosion control works in the rural roads
            component, an integral part part of the microcatchment
            interventions, consisting of minor reshaping of road
            profiles, with shoulder remodeling, various drainage and
            erosion control works, and road regraveling; 5) training and
            dissemination; and 6) project coordination and administration.
