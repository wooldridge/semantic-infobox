&#13;
            MR. SANDSTROM:    Good morning and welcome.   We&#13;
&#13;
 have one major item on the agenda today, and it is the&#13;
&#13;
 World Development Report 2000/01 on Attacking Poverty.&#13;
&#13;
 And with that report goes the Selected World Development&#13;
&#13;
 Indicators for 2000.     It will be published as an annex to&#13;
&#13;
 the WDR.&#13;
&#13;
            I believe we have at least eight written&#13;
&#13;
 statements from you -- from Ms. O'Leary, Mr. Abraham, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Crawford, Mr. Ferrer, Mr. Garcia, Mr. Holden, Mr. Meyer&#13;
&#13;
 and Mr. Wan Abdullah.&#13;
&#13;
            And Nick will introduce followed by Nora Lustig&#13;
&#13;
 and Mike Walton.   Nick Stern, please.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. STERN:   Thank you very much, Sven.&#13;
&#13;
            Could I start by saying how happy I am to be&#13;
&#13;
 here at last.   I have had the chance to meet many of you&#13;
&#13;
 at the DEC retreat and also some of you yesterday at the&#13;
&#13;
 GDN briefing.   But it is my first attendance at a Board&#13;
&#13;
 here and my relationship with you will be central to my&#13;
&#13;
 work, and I am looking forward very much to a cheerful&#13;
&#13;
 and productive relationship and to getting to know as&#13;
&#13;
 many of you as possible personally as soon as possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Now the structure of how we are organizing the&#13;
&#13;
 introduction is I will say a few words particularly about&#13;
&#13;
 the resignation of Ravi Kanbur, because I am sure that&#13;
&#13;
 that is an item that interests you -- it certainly&#13;
&#13;
 interests us -- and then Nora Lustig will introduce the&#13;
&#13;
 report itself, highlighting the key messages, and some&#13;
&#13;
 response to the very helpful and constructive written&#13;
&#13;
 statements that we received, and then Mike Walton will&#13;
&#13;
 say something about the operational implications of the&#13;
&#13;
 ideas in the report.&#13;
&#13;
           I have been personally involved only really&#13;
&#13;
 since May.   So, I should begin by thanking the team for&#13;
&#13;
 their work over two years but, in particular, their work&#13;
&#13;
 over a very difficult last two or three months.       They&#13;
&#13;
 have stuck together magnificently.        Nora and Mike have&#13;
&#13;
 been at the heart of that, and I also want to take the&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity to thank Jo Ritzen for his role in pulling&#13;
&#13;
 everybody behind it in DEC and in other parts of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 during that very difficult period.&#13;
&#13;
           I am sure you appreciate just what the&#13;
&#13;
 pressures were over the last two months and they have&#13;
&#13;
 responded absolutely magnificently.&#13;
&#13;
           Now my own involvement, as I said, is only&#13;
&#13;
 since last May, but I will be out there in front&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 presenting it in September.       And whilst I was not&#13;
&#13;
 involved in the discussion of the report, I should say&#13;
&#13;
 that I will be very comfortable standing out in September&#13;
&#13;
 and presenting the reports and the ideas therein.         I&#13;
&#13;
 share them; I think they are important, and I think this&#13;
&#13;
 is a very significant contribution.&#13;
&#13;
             It is easy for me to say that since I didn't&#13;
&#13;
 write it.    But it is not so easy for the others to say&#13;
&#13;
 that.&#13;
&#13;
             Now this was not only innovative in ideas, this&#13;
&#13;
 report, but also in process.       And it was a process&#13;
&#13;
 involving great consultation; initially, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 central to that was the Voices of the Poor.         So, it says&#13;
&#13;
 a lot here that you have already heard; it is for a good&#13;
&#13;
 reason because Voices of the Poor was very much a part of&#13;
&#13;
 the whole process.&#13;
&#13;
             And that has helped us greatly in articulating&#13;
&#13;
 a conceptual approach to poverty.         So, obviously, as&#13;
&#13;
 academics in some sense, we bring our own intellectual&#13;
&#13;
 framework but that has come together and has been&#13;
&#13;
 influenced by, in many ways driven by, the Voices of the&#13;
&#13;
 Poor.   So, that is where we start and that was a very&#13;
&#13;
 important part of the consultation process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
             Then, there was the so-called red cover version&#13;
&#13;
 which went on the web in January and that received&#13;
&#13;
 tremendous amount of comments, from NGOs, from academics,&#13;
&#13;
 from donors, from governments, an enormous amount of&#13;
&#13;
 comments.&#13;
&#13;
             Now participation, of course, is very time&#13;
&#13;
 consuming because there is no point in interacting if you&#13;
&#13;
 don't respond.    So that, given all the comments that we&#13;
&#13;
 have received, some helpful, some not so helpful, over&#13;
&#13;
 the last six or nine months, it has been a real process&#13;
&#13;
 to try to respond to those in a responsible way.        But, of&#13;
&#13;
 course, if you do have that sort of consultation, if you&#13;
&#13;
 do get a draft out early, you expect it to change.        There&#13;
&#13;
 is not much point in consulting with people and then&#13;
&#13;
 saying, well, we have heard you but we stick to what we&#13;
&#13;
 have got.&#13;
&#13;
             So, there was a process of change and that&#13;
&#13;
 takes us to Ravi's resignation.        Now at the beginning of&#13;
&#13;
 May, in response to the various comments that there had&#13;
&#13;
 been, including my own I have to say, there was a&#13;
&#13;
 recasting of the overview which represented a road map&#13;
&#13;
 for the recasting of the report.        That was in early May,&#13;
&#13;
 May the 8th I think, and it was a recasting or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 restructuring of the overview in which Ravi had a very&#13;
&#13;
 strong role.     So, that was the plan.&#13;
&#13;
           Now Ravi said he was already uncomfortable with&#13;
&#13;
 that plan.     He did it rather well actually, but said he&#13;
&#13;
 was uncomfortable with that plan.          But the key factor in&#13;
&#13;
 his resignation was a forecast.         He forecasted the move&#13;
&#13;
 that had been made was the first of a number of moves&#13;
&#13;
 which would lead the report in a direction with which he&#13;
&#13;
 would be uncomfortable.&#13;
&#13;
           It was a genuine, honest forecast from a very&#13;
&#13;
 decent man.    It turned out to be wrong.            The recasting&#13;
&#13;
 which was structured in the May overview, in which Ravi&#13;
&#13;
 had a very strong hand, is more or less the one which you&#13;
&#13;
 see today.     So, it was a forecast error.           Our economists&#13;
&#13;
 make many forecast errors, and this was one of them.                 I&#13;
&#13;
 say it was genuine and honest in a situation of a great&#13;
&#13;
 deal of pressure -- a great deal of pressure -- which he&#13;
&#13;
 felt; I think he felt more than there was actually, but&#13;
&#13;
 he felt greatly under pressure, and I think it was a&#13;
&#13;
 wrong forecast.&#13;
&#13;
           As a result of that, he started to look much&#13;
&#13;
 better; he even looked very well.          And I had a beer with&#13;
&#13;
 him last night and he looks very well, I have to say.&#13;
&#13;
 And I thanked him for his reticence, and he has not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 spoken to the press.    I think we should be clear about&#13;
&#13;
 that.   Ravi has not spoken to the press.          I think he has&#13;
&#13;
 been very good about that.     He has an obligation, of&#13;
&#13;
 course, but he has met that obligation and I thanked him&#13;
&#13;
 for it.   I am sure you would want to as well.&#13;
&#13;
           Now we didn't just leave it, of course, when&#13;
&#13;
 Ravi resigned.   We did our best as friends, as people&#13;
&#13;
 with an institutional obligation, to try to persuade him&#13;
&#13;
 to change his mind.    At the suggestion of Jim Wolfensohn,&#13;
&#13;
 I called a meeting outside the U.S. in the U.K. with&#13;
&#13;
 Amatya Sen, myself, Tony Atkinson who is a very&#13;
&#13;
 distinguished economist, or Sir Tony Atkinson he is now -&#13;
&#13;
 - he wasn't then -- Warden [phonetic] of Oxford who is&#13;
&#13;
 one of the leading analysts of poverty and income&#13;
&#13;
 distribution in the world, and there was Mike Walton.&#13;
&#13;
 So, it was a small group with Ravi where we went through&#13;
&#13;
 for four or five hours the intellectual issues of the&#13;
&#13;
 report.&#13;
&#13;
           It was very friendly and relaxed and we had&#13;
&#13;
 dinner together afterwards where we tried to show to Ravi&#13;
&#13;
 that the ideas which he held there, which were important&#13;
&#13;
 ideas, were there in the revised structure of the report.&#13;
&#13;
           But he had made up his mind.         It was civilized&#13;
&#13;
 but he was adamant and he didn't want to change his mind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 So, at that point, we realized that his resignation was&#13;
&#13;
 irreversible and the structure which has been followed,&#13;
&#13;
 which had already been in place actually, but the&#13;
&#13;
 structure which has been followed since then was&#13;
&#13;
 confirmed with Nora as the Director and Mike Walton&#13;
&#13;
 working very closely as he has from the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
           So that was the sequence of events.       Now what&#13;
&#13;
 about the substantive parts of the changes?        People ask&#13;
&#13;
 us very much about the difference between the January&#13;
&#13;
 version, the red cover version, and this one.       As I said,&#13;
&#13;
 there should be differences; otherwise, there is no point&#13;
&#13;
 in having a consultation process.&#13;
&#13;
           The main differences are essentially in&#13;
&#13;
 ordering emphasis.   In the older version, the ordering of&#13;
&#13;
 this basic triad of empowerment, security, opportunity&#13;
&#13;
 was as I have just described it.       Now we put opportunity&#13;
&#13;
 to the front.&#13;
&#13;
           Now that is mainly -- it is not only -- but it&#13;
&#13;
 is mainly an expositional device, but it is a very point&#13;
&#13;
 expositional change because what we wanted to do was to&#13;
&#13;
 get on the table right at the beginning of the report the&#13;
&#13;
 basic common ground; the idea that you overcome poverty&#13;
&#13;
 by creating opportunities largely through the growth&#13;
&#13;
 process, creating opportunities and helping the poor to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 participate in taking those opportunities, particularly&#13;
&#13;
 through education and health, that I think is of&#13;
&#13;
 fundamental importance but fairly common ground.&#13;
&#13;
           It is accepted; it is, if you like, the basic&#13;
&#13;
 message of the 1990 WDR.     It is one that I think has been&#13;
&#13;
 confirmed by experience since then, and it is very&#13;
&#13;
 important if you are moving ahead introducing new ideas,&#13;
&#13;
 which there are in the report, to establish a basic&#13;
&#13;
 common ground of a point of departure.&#13;
&#13;
           And we found in some of the interpretations of&#13;
&#13;
 what had gone before a feeling that growth had been&#13;
&#13;
 thrown out or neglected or essentially put down the list.&#13;
&#13;
 There was an implicit suggestion, many people felt, that&#13;
&#13;
 it was unimportant.&#13;
&#13;
           Now if you read the January version, it doesn't&#13;
&#13;
 say that growth was unimportant.       It says the opposite.&#13;
&#13;
 But it gave the impression -- and the impression that&#13;
&#13;
 people get from a document is an empirical matter; they&#13;
&#13;
 either get it or they don't.      And it was an empirical&#13;
&#13;
 matter they did get the impression that growth was being&#13;
&#13;
 downgraded.   And that was a problem because it meant that&#13;
&#13;
 they did not actually get to grips with some of the new&#13;
&#13;
 ideas because they were too irritated about having lost,&#13;

&#13;
 as it were, or having downgraded what they thought they&#13;
&#13;
 knew.&#13;
&#13;
             So, the exposition of putting opportunity out&#13;
&#13;
 front was very important actually in bringing people to&#13;
&#13;
 serious grips with the newer ideas of empowerment and&#13;
&#13;
 security.    So, it was partly exposition, but expositional&#13;
&#13;
 change in response to misunderstanding which were clearly&#13;
&#13;
 generating.    So, we felt that it was important to make&#13;
&#13;
 that change on that point of view.&#13;
&#13;
             At the same time, of course, I think it is fair&#13;
&#13;
 to say that it does represent some change in emphasis,&#13;
&#13;
 but I put it that way around -- first, exposition, and&#13;
&#13;
 then some change in emphasis.&#13;
&#13;
             So, that is how the Ravi story unfolded and&#13;
&#13;
 this is a very brief description of the structural change&#13;
&#13;
 in the report as a result of the consultation processes&#13;
&#13;
 which took place mainly since January.&#13;
&#13;
             Now let me thank you very much for all of your&#13;
&#13;
 comments.    We will use them intensively in the few days&#13;
&#13;
 that remain, but we will.      We will also try to use them&#13;
&#13;
 in the presentations, try to pick up some of the points&#13;
&#13;
 in the presentations which we give in September time and&#13;
&#13;
 afterwards of the report itself.&#13;

           So, we will go as much as we can into the&#13;
&#13;
 changes now.   Obviously, we are in the last stages, but&#13;
&#13;
 there is a lot we can do now and we will do that in good&#13;
&#13;
 spirit, but we will also pick it up in our presentations&#13;
&#13;
 down the track.&#13;
&#13;
           So, that is by way of introduction.           Nora&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
           MS. LUSTIG:    [Showing slides.]          Thank you,&#13;
&#13;
 Nick, and thank you, Sven.      Let me join Nick also in&#13;
&#13;
 thanking Mr. Wan Abdullah, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Crawford, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Ferrer, Mr. Garcia, Mr. Holden, Mr. Meyer and Ms. O'Leary&#13;

 and all the people who joined in the bilateral meetings&#13;
&#13;
 for their very useful comments and suggestions that they&#13;
&#13;
 have sent to us.&#13;
&#13;
           As you know, the WDR 2000/01 assumes a broader&#13;
&#13;
 definition of poverty.     This is based on new development&#13;
&#13;
 thinking but also on the results of the multiple&#13;
&#13;
 participatory poverty assessments and the Voices of the&#13;
&#13;
 Poor study which accompanied the production of this&#13;
&#13;
 report.&#13;
&#13;
           Poverty is not only material deprivation like&#13;
&#13;
 low consumption or low income and not only low human&#13;
&#13;
 development, i.e. lower education and health, but it is&#13;
&#13;
 also lack of voice and ability to influence the decisions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 that affect one's lives, what we call voicelessness and&#13;
&#13;
 powerlessness and it is also acute vulnerability to&#13;
&#13;
 address external shocks -- illness, economic crises,&#13;
&#13;
 natural disasters.&#13;
&#13;
           This report also argues that the causes of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty are multi-dimensional.       Poverty is not the result&#13;
&#13;
 of economic forces alone; it is a result of economic,&#13;
&#13;
 social and political processes that interact with each&#13;
&#13;
 other and frequently reinforce each other in ways that&#13;
&#13;
 exacerbate the situation of deprivation in which the poor&#13;
&#13;
 live.&#13;
&#13;
           Based on this broader definition of poverty and&#13;
&#13;
 this deeper understanding of the causes, the WDR 2000/01&#13;
&#13;
 implies an extension and a repositioning of the strategy&#13;
&#13;
 to reduce poverty, in which we emphasize areas that were&#13;
&#13;
 not central before.   As before, promoting opportunity&#13;
&#13;
 will be an inherent part of a poverty reduction strategy&#13;
&#13;
 and that was primarily the content of the WDR 1990.       But&#13;
&#13;
 we also think facilitating empowerment and enhancing&#13;
&#13;
 security have to be an integral part of this poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           We pose that there is no ranking among the&#13;
&#13;
 three there, different but interrelated elements of one&#13;
&#13;
 integrated poverty reduction strategy.         They are&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 important in their own right but they also reinforce each&#13;
&#13;
 other.&#13;
&#13;
           Like some of your comments point out, higher&#13;
&#13;
 incomes improve the material well-being but, at the same&#13;
&#13;
 time, increase the bargaining power of poor people and&#13;
&#13;
 reduce their vulnerability.      Also, if we have more&#13;
&#13;
 responsive state and social institutions, this empowers&#13;
&#13;
 poor people but, at the same time, expands poor people's&#13;
&#13;
 assets and help them cope with shocks.&#13;
&#13;
           In addition, lowering poor people's&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability to risks improve their well-being but also&#13;
&#13;
 encourages investment in higher-risk/higher-return&#13;
&#13;
 activities and strengthens poor people's ability to&#13;
&#13;
 influence the decision-making process.&#13;
&#13;
           There are a number of research results and&#13;
&#13;
 trends that have taken place during the 1990s that lead&#13;
&#13;
 to this repositioning of the poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
 We list some of them, and let me focus on a couple.&#13;
&#13;
           For example, WDR 1990 recommended to increase&#13;
&#13;
 investment in human capital by expanding social spending.&#13;
&#13;
 When we look at the evidence, what we find is that there&#13;
&#13;
 has been an increase in social spending during the 1990s,&#13;
&#13;
 but it has occurred at a lower rate than GDP growth.&#13;
&#13;
 Second, we do find that still the allocation of spending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 on education and health tends to be quite regressive.&#13;
&#13;
 And thirdly, even if spending increases, the outcomes are&#13;
&#13;
 not necessarily that good.&#13;
&#13;
           Hence, the importance of making some changes at&#13;
&#13;
 the level of the institutional delivery of social&#13;
&#13;
 services that will improve the quality of the outcomes in&#13;
&#13;
 the human development dimension.&#13;
&#13;
           Another important aspect that this WDR&#13;
&#13;
 emphasizes is the link between growth, inequality and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction.   As before, we find that there is a&#13;
&#13;
 close association between economic growth and poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction.   Contractions imply sharp increases in&#13;
&#13;
 poverty; expansions imply reduction in poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           Nevertheless, the pace at which income poverty&#13;
&#13;
 is reduced and other dimensions of poverty are reduced&#13;
&#13;
 are connected to the level of initial inequalities in&#13;
&#13;
 assets, income, between genders, between ethnic and&#13;
&#13;
 racial groups.   For example, we can see that for&#13;
&#13;
 societies that have low degrees of inequalities, like the&#13;
&#13;
 ones that are on the left, the poverty reduction ability&#13;
&#13;
 of the same growth is twice as high than for societies&#13;
&#13;
 that have high inequality.&#13;
&#13;
           Also, research results show that how closing&#13;
&#13;
 some of the inequalities that exist in society -- for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 example, here we are showing the gender gap and what&#13;
&#13;
 would happen if you close the gender gap -- it can have a&#13;
&#13;
 positive impact on growth.     So, not only inequality is&#13;
&#13;
 good for poverty reduction, because for the same growth&#13;
&#13;
 rate you can achieve more reduction in poverty, but also&#13;
&#13;
 addressing certain types of inequality can result in&#13;
&#13;
 better outcomes in terms of growth itself.&#13;
&#13;
           Under the opportunity pillar, we discuss three&#13;
&#13;
 items.   Implementing market reforms for growth is very&#13;
&#13;
 important, and the report acknowledges very upfront that&#13;
&#13;
 reforms deliver better growth outcomes and that there is&#13;
&#13;
 no systematic relationship between reforms and income&#13;
&#13;
 inequality.   However, the report acknowledges as well&#13;
&#13;
 that reforms can fail and, when they fail, they have a&#13;
&#13;
 very drastic impact on poverty, and that the failure is&#13;
&#13;
 often associated to the lack of institutional foundations&#13;
&#13;
 to make them succeed and to perhaps an innocent&#13;
&#13;
 assessment of the political economy dynamics whereby&#13;
&#13;
 sometimes you generate new forms of rent-seeking during&#13;
&#13;
 the process of reforms.&#13;
&#13;
           The report also emphasized the fact that even&#13;
&#13;
 if reforms do not systematically lead to higher&#13;
&#13;
 inequality, there are losers and there are winners and&#13;
&#13;
 that in the process of designing the reforms,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 compensatory schemes for the losers have to form an&#13;
&#13;
 inherent part, particularly when the losers are poor.&#13;
&#13;
           In the area of making markets work better for&#13;
&#13;
 poor people, we want to emphasize something that in the&#13;
&#13;
 reform agenda has not taken center stage, which is the&#13;
&#13;
 micro deregulation.   Essentially here, it is the removal&#13;
&#13;
 of the barriers that affect the small micro and medium&#13;
&#13;
 enterprises to allow them to do business.          And we think&#13;
&#13;
 that can actually accomplish quite a bit in the area of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           In the area of expanding poor people's assets,&#13;
&#13;
 we think we have to put particular emphasis on using the&#13;
&#13;
 redistributive power of the state.        As we mentioned&#13;
&#13;
 earlier, the allocation of spending in the social areas&#13;
&#13;
 is still regressive; the overall spending is even more&#13;
&#13;
 regressive.   So, a lot can be accomplished through that&#13;
&#13;
 instrument.&#13;
&#13;
           We are less emphatic about using the tax as an&#13;
&#13;
 instrument for redistribution -- some of you pointed that&#13;
&#13;
 out in the comments -- because the evidence shows that it&#13;
&#13;
 is better to have a non-distortionary tax system for&#13;
&#13;
 efficiency objectives and what you would be able to&#13;
&#13;
 accomplish on the equity side by changing the tax system&#13;
&#13;
 to make it more progressive is often small.         So, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 efficiency costs could be much higher than the benefits&#13;
&#13;
 on the redistributive side.      Hence, the emphasis on using&#13;
&#13;
 the redistributive spending side of the state.&#13;
&#13;
           We think that it is very important to exploit&#13;
&#13;
 synergies and we put emphasis on programs or recommend&#13;
&#13;
 programs that look at not only the supply side but also&#13;
&#13;
 the demand side, the constraints that people face to&#13;
&#13;
 actually make use of social services.         We also suggest&#13;
&#13;
 the use of innovative approaches to the delivery of&#13;
&#13;
 social services which is not just a state who is going to&#13;
&#13;
 be in charge of providing them but using multiple agents.&#13;
&#13;
 And we also support the idea of exploring asset&#13;
&#13;
 redistribution in the private sector, particularly in the&#13;
&#13;
 area of land, maybe using the new innovations that have&#13;
&#13;
 been developed in the form of market-based land reforms&#13;
&#13;
 or other forms of land reforms wherever it is possible.&#13;
&#13;
           Under the empowerment umbrella section, the&#13;
&#13;
 report discusses actions that can make the state&#13;
&#13;
 institutions more accountable and responsive for poor&#13;
&#13;
 people and also that can help build social capital and&#13;
&#13;
 remove social barriers.    Let me give you a few examples.&#13;
&#13;
           From the point of view of the legal system,&#13;
&#13;
 there are elements implicit in the law that imply&#13;
&#13;
 discriminatory practices or that the law can be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 implemented in discriminatory ways.          For example, we&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned the issue of joint land titling for couples&#13;
&#13;
 instead of heads of households to expand the assets that&#13;
&#13;
 women can hold.&#13;
&#13;
           To make legal systems also more accessible to&#13;
&#13;
 poor people, we think that supporting legal organizations&#13;
&#13;
 can help people have access to the court system, defend&#13;
&#13;
 their rights and use the litigation system to promote&#13;
&#13;
 their objectives.&#13;
&#13;
           We also think that decentralization done in a&#13;
&#13;
 way in which you minimize the possibility of having local&#13;
&#13;
 -- the capture by locals can help in the process of&#13;
&#13;
 delivery of projects and social services.              We have an&#13;
&#13;
 example here of how decentralizing and involving&#13;
&#13;
 communities can actually reduce the cost of transferring&#13;
&#13;
 resources to the poor.      This is a study that was done for&#13;
&#13;
 South Africa.   And, as you can see, when the community&#13;
&#13;
 becomes the sole implementer of the project, it costs&#13;
&#13;
 about half as much to transfer resources to poor people&#13;
&#13;
 than when it doesn't have any involvement at all.&#13;
&#13;
           In reducing discriminatory practices, we think&#13;
&#13;
 that we can also help by using typical instruments that&#13;
&#13;
 are used for purposes of other aspects.              To improve, for&#13;
&#13;
 example, the participation of women in education, using&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 subsidies for girls has been shown to work effectively in&#13;
&#13;
 addressing that gap.&#13;
&#13;
           Under the security empowerment, the report&#13;
&#13;
 argues that it is very important to devise mechanisms to&#13;
&#13;
 help poor people manage risks.         In general, what has been&#13;
&#13;
 happening in the countries and what the countries have&#13;
&#13;
 dealt with in terms of reforms is looking at the foremost&#13;
&#13;
 social security systems in which poor people tend not to&#13;
&#13;
 participate.     So, it is very important to have other&#13;
&#13;
 instruments that can address social protection needs of&#13;
&#13;
 poor people, as well as reduce the risk themselves by&#13;
&#13;
 investing in building up private assets as well as public&#13;
&#13;
 assets.   For example, we have here building private&#13;
&#13;
 assets by helping poor people accumulate savings,&#13;
&#13;
 providing microfinance institutions that can actually&#13;
&#13;
 help develop those savings and other forms in which you&#13;
&#13;
 reduce risks.&#13;
&#13;
           We also acknowledge that one important cause of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty, not only in the short-term but also can trap&#13;
&#13;
 poor people in the long-term in poverty traps, are&#13;
&#13;
 economy-wide shocks, like economic crises and natural&#13;
&#13;
 disasters.     Often people just concentrate on the short-&#13;
&#13;
 term impact but they can have irreversible impacts on&#13;
&#13;
 particularly the young because nutritional levels fall&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 because children are pulled out of school.          So, having&#13;
&#13;
 mechanisms to help poor people cope with aggregate shocks&#13;
&#13;
 is fundamental in addressing current poverty and also&#13;
&#13;
 protecting poor people from being locked in longer-term&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.&#13;
&#13;
             Four areas that may be particularly important&#13;
&#13;
 when thinking about how to cope with aggregate shocks is&#13;
&#13;
 that we need to have mechanisms that will help us protect&#13;
&#13;
 the spending items that benefit poor people during times&#13;
&#13;
 of fiscal austerity.     There are some recommendations in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of how you can use mechanisms within the budgetary&#13;
&#13;
 process so that happens, and also that it is very&#13;
&#13;
 important to have safety nets that exist on a permanent&#13;
&#13;
 basis, not necessarily are used on a permanent basis but&#13;
&#13;
 exist on a permanent basis, that they are counter-&#13;
&#13;
 cyclical.    We have evidence that often spending on safety&#13;
&#13;
 nets for the poor has been pro-cyclical, and that funding&#13;
&#13;
 must be ensured through the initial process.&#13;
&#13;
             The report finally argues very forcefully --&#13;
&#13;
 and this is also in response to some of the comments that&#13;
&#13;
 were made to us through the written statements and the&#13;
&#13;
 bilateral interactions -- that addressing poverty will&#13;
&#13;
 require actions beyond national boundaries, and the&#13;
&#13;
 global actions will have to be an essential component if&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 we want to make a difference in terms of what will happen&#13;
&#13;
 to poverty outcomes in the years to come.&#13;
&#13;
             We particularly discuss a number of areas that&#13;
&#13;
 we think are among the most important but by no means&#13;
&#13;
 exhaustive of what developed countries and international&#13;
&#13;
 cooperation can do to help the process of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction.&#13;
&#13;
             Emphasis is put on market opening by developed&#13;
&#13;
 countries.    We know that a number of the goods and&#13;
&#13;
 services that poor countries produce do not find their&#13;
&#13;
 way into the rich countries' markets.          We also think that&#13;
&#13;
 there is a responsibility to help financial stability,&#13;
&#13;
 the financing of medical public goods, such as medical&#13;
&#13;
 research in the area of AIDS, malaria, et cetera, and&#13;
&#13;
 research in agriculture, emphasizing and expanding debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief and increased development assistance by shifting&#13;
&#13;
 more the use of aid to a country-focused program that&#13;
&#13;
 involves poverty reduction at the center.           And also we&#13;
&#13;
 emphasize the fact that participation of poor countries&#13;
&#13;
 in global forums has to be expanded and made more&#13;
&#13;
 emphatic.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, let me say a few words about the&#13;
&#13;
 developing country policies, what do we mean?           What does&#13;
&#13;
 the WDR mean in actual strategies and policies?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           We often hear -- and also this appears in the&#13;
&#13;
 written comments -- that the WDR doesn't give priorities.&#13;
&#13;
 And I think that in a way this is correct because the WDR&#13;
&#13;
 sets the stage for a comprehensive way of thinking about&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction.     It introduces areas that were not&#13;
&#13;
 emphasized before that have to be looked at much more&#13;
&#13;
 carefully.     And it does provide a solid sense of&#13;
&#13;
 direction in terms of policies.         The WDR is full of&#13;
&#13;
 actions we recommend in different areas.&#13;
&#13;
           However, the priorities and the sequencing of&#13;
&#13;
 actions have to be worked out at the country level,&#13;
&#13;
 because what is important in countries in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 multiple limits of the poverty, one needs to be attack&#13;
&#13;
 first and how to attack it will be dependent on what the&#13;
&#13;
 experience of the country is, what the institutions that&#13;
&#13;
 the country has can deliver, and what is it that society&#13;
&#13;
 wants to give priority to.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that the Bank is already beginning to&#13;
&#13;
 have an experience with this with the PRSP process, of&#13;
&#13;
 which Mike Walton, my successor here in the presentation,&#13;
&#13;
 will speak on some more.&#13;
&#13;
           I want to thank you again for all of your&#13;
&#13;
 comments and I am looking forward to the discussion that&#13;
&#13;
 will follow.&#13;

&#13;
           MR. WALTON:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           When we discussed the Poverty Progress Report&#13;
&#13;
 here in April, we also discussed an implementation note&#13;
&#13;
 on actions for the World Bank.       And it was proposed that&#13;
&#13;
 we prepare a note on the implications of the WDR 2000/01&#13;
&#13;
 for the Bank's poverty reduction strategy along with any&#13;
&#13;
 measures we propose to increase the effectiveness of our&#13;
&#13;
 instruments.   And we said then that we would share a&#13;
&#13;
 draft of such a note with Executive Directors in the&#13;
&#13;
 fall, but then follow that with a broad consultation&#13;
&#13;
 outside the Bank, coming back again to the Board in the&#13;
&#13;
 second half of the fiscal year for a formal discussion.&#13;
&#13;
           And today, I would just like to update the&#13;
&#13;
 Board on our current thinking.       We are still on track&#13;
&#13;
 with this approach.     I would like to update the Board&#13;
&#13;
 first in terms of how we see the WDR, what the&#13;
&#13;
 implications are for what we would do differently, and,&#13;
&#13;
 second, in terms of the process of discussing, agreeing&#13;
&#13;
 upon and advising both staff and partners.         And as you&#13;
&#13;
 have already seen, this WDR already has a wealth of&#13;
&#13;
 implications for action both in terms of the nature of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 development strategy and the conduct of development&#13;
&#13;
 assistance.&#13;
&#13;
           So, first, let's sketch what will be different.&#13;
&#13;
 And here, I would divide it into the updating of our&#13;
&#13;
 substantive strategy, improving our operational&#13;
&#13;
 instruments and training, dissemination and debate.&#13;
&#13;
           First, substantive strategy:         We emphasized&#13;
&#13;
 that the WDR 2000/01 very much builds upon and deepens&#13;
&#13;
 the strategy for development laid out in WDR 1990.         But&#13;
&#13;
 let's briefly revisit the areas which make a difference&#13;
&#13;
 to the substantive focus of our work.&#13;
&#13;
           First, recognition that both market-oriented&#13;
&#13;
 reform and traditional social or other public investments&#13;
&#13;
 have to be designed in a fashion that takes account of&#13;
&#13;
 local realities in order to be effective, with pkt&#13;
&#13;
 attention to the impact on inequality and on transitional&#13;
&#13;
 losses.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, a heightened focus on the centrality of&#13;
&#13;
 formal institutions, and as well of social capital,&#13;
&#13;
 exclusion and of participatory processes.&#13;
&#13;
           Third, increased priority to both understanding&#13;
&#13;
 and acting upon sources of vulnerability at the local and&#13;
&#13;
 national level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           And fourth, an increased focus on the role of&#13;
&#13;
 global forces and of the importance of action at the&#13;
&#13;
 global level.   Global public goods is just one example of&#13;
&#13;
 this.   These shifts will affect and indeed are already&#13;
&#13;
 affecting the mix of our work at the country, sector and&#13;
&#13;
 global level.&#13;
&#13;
           Second issue, operational work:          In order to&#13;
&#13;
 underpin this updated substantive focus, we are also&#13;
&#13;
 updating our instruments.     And as noted in the April&#13;
&#13;
 implementation note, we expect this to include within our&#13;
&#13;
 client three areas:   first, revised guidelines for&#13;
&#13;
 poverty diagnosis in terms of both advice on good&#13;
&#13;
 practice and techniques and also on what we judge to be&#13;
&#13;
 required to underpin country strategies; second, an&#13;
&#13;
 increased focus on monitoring and evaluation to deepen&#13;
&#13;
 our understanding of the results of public action; and&#13;
&#13;
 third, a revisiting of the program targeted interventions&#13;
&#13;
 over the coming year.&#13;
&#13;
           This PTI was introduced after the WDR 1990&#13;
&#13;
 mindful of its imperfections as a proxy for actions that&#13;
&#13;
 directly affect the poor.     And now that we are moving&#13;
&#13;
 more decisively to a genuinely-results oriented&#13;
&#13;
 framework, we need to decide how and when we can do&#13;
&#13;
 better.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
             I would add to that list a fourth area, since&#13;
&#13;
 the April discussion, which is very much related to the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion in Chapter 11, and that is shifting towards&#13;
&#13;
 more results-oriented approaches to development&#13;
&#13;
 assistance and lending including recent approaches to&#13;
&#13;
 more pragmatic approaches to development assistance.&#13;
&#13;
             The third area concerns training, dissemination&#13;
&#13;
 and debate.    In the April implementation note, we&#13;
&#13;
 referred to the importance of strengthening staff&#13;
&#13;
 capacity, inter alia, via training.         We would now give&#13;
&#13;
 this a much broader orientation, not least in view of the&#13;
&#13;
 recent debates over the last two to three months.         And we&#13;
&#13;
 are now planning to use this WDR as an input both to&#13;
&#13;
 internal training, working with the various sector&#13;
&#13;
 boards, but, even more importantly, as a key instrument&#13;
&#13;
 to foster external debate, where we will be working&#13;
&#13;
 closely with the World Bank Institute and, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 with regional programs.&#13;
&#13;
             So, how were we thinking about the process of&#13;
&#13;
 how we will discuss and incorporate this into Bank&#13;
&#13;
 practice?    And I would like to emphasize that the&#13;
&#13;
 mechanisms for follow-up to this WDR are very different&#13;
&#13;
 both from the WDR 1990 -- we were in a very different&#13;
&#13;
 situation then -- and we are also very different from a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 document that is concerned with a particular sector or&#13;
&#13;
 domain for public action.     And this is for two reasons.&#13;
&#13;
           First, it obviously deals with the Bank's over-&#13;
&#13;
 arching mandate and so affects all that we do.     And&#13;
&#13;
 second, to some extent, we are already implementing many&#13;
&#13;
 of the new developments synthesized in the WDR, for&#13;
&#13;
 example, in the design of the Comprehensive Development&#13;
&#13;
 Framework and the poverty reduction strategy program, and&#13;
&#13;
 I might add on the latter that when we were thinking&#13;
&#13;
 through the substantive content of the PRSP, we made use&#13;
&#13;
 last summer of the emerging substantive structure of the&#13;
&#13;
 WDR because these were going very much in parallel.&#13;
&#13;
           Furthermore, in the greatly increased&#13;
&#13;
 participation work over the past few years, in the&#13;
&#13;
 increased institutional orientation embodied in the&#13;
&#13;
 public sector strategy paper, and in the heightened focus&#13;
&#13;
 on social risk management laid out in the social&#13;
&#13;
 protection strategy paper.&#13;
&#13;
           So, we don't want to do a grant resynthesis of&#13;
&#13;
 all those.   What we do rather plan to do is the&#13;
&#13;
 following.   First, we will update guidelines on poverty&#13;
&#13;
 diagnosis, on monitoring evaluation options for the&#13;
&#13;
 program of targeted interventions and we will reflect&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 these in updated operational guidelines including in the&#13;
&#13;
 conversion of OD 4.15 to OP/BP format.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, we will be incorporating lessons for&#13;
&#13;
 lending instruments within our ongoing work, including&#13;
&#13;
 under the reviews of the PRSP and under other auspices&#13;
&#13;
 that discuss instruments.&#13;
&#13;
           Third, we will ensure that the ongoing&#13;
&#13;
 revisions of the poverty reduction strategy source book&#13;
&#13;
 flesh out the new thinking embodied in the WDR in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of good practice and in terms of techniques.&#13;
&#13;
           And fourth, we will develop a coherent program&#13;
&#13;
 of training and debate.    And finally, this will be&#13;
&#13;
 reflected in the new work on the strategic framework that&#13;
&#13;
 is going to be discussed in the fall with the Board and&#13;
&#13;
 in the Strategic Forum.&#13;
&#13;
           The note for the Board in fall will basically&#13;
&#13;
 map out both issues and the mechanisms for&#13;
&#13;
 operationalizing them, and we look forward to discussing&#13;
&#13;
 these with Executive Directors.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much, Mike.&#13;
&#13;
           And let me again thank you for the eight&#13;
&#13;
 written statements.    As Nick said, we are going to make&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 full use of them as we continue to work on and finalize&#13;
&#13;
 the WDR.&#13;
&#13;
            But now equally importantly I have at least ten&#13;
&#13;
 statements coming.     I have ten names on my list --&#13;
&#13;
 Biskup, Singh, Haque, Balduino, Zhu Xian, Hubloue, Gomes,&#13;
&#13;
 Brandt, Davidse, and Shin Oya, and a few more.&#13;
&#13;
            Eckhardt Biskup, please.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. BISKUP:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            Mr. Chairman, first, I would like the statement&#13;
&#13;
 of Mr. Walton to be circulated to the Board.&#13;
&#13;
            Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me thank staff&#13;
&#13;
 and all participants for the tremendous work with&#13;
&#13;
 significant results.     As we submitted at the end of May&#13;
&#13;
 already our detailed comments, today I want only to&#13;
&#13;
 briefly touch on the content of the WDR and focus on the&#13;
&#13;
 process which brought us to today's discussion.&#13;
&#13;
            On the content, first, I welcome that the new&#13;
&#13;
 version of the WDR focuses more on the responsibility of&#13;
&#13;
 industrialized countries to reduce poverty by creating&#13;
&#13;
 supportive global, economic and social framework&#13;
&#13;
 conditions.&#13;
&#13;
            Second, the WDR should elaborate a bit more on&#13;
&#13;
 the content of the exposure and dialogue program as an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 important means to sensitize decision-makers on poverty&#13;
&#13;
 and development related issues.&#13;
&#13;
           Third and finally, while going through the list&#13;
&#13;
 of background papers, which covers an impressive 92&#13;
&#13;
 pages, I realized that the vast majority of publications&#13;
&#13;
 are in English and about 150 titles refer to the World&#13;
&#13;
 Bank itself.   I am just wondering whether this is already&#13;
&#13;
 the decentralization of literature which Ravi Kanbur&#13;
&#13;
 highlighted during his visit to the OECD/DAC network on&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction in March in Paris this year.&#13;
&#13;
           Now a quick word on the process of WDR.            The&#13;
&#13;
 Voices of the Poor exercise was a pretty unique&#13;
&#13;
 undertaking and is fundamental in this report, its&#13;
&#13;
 conclusions and impact for future development work.&#13;
&#13;
 Taking poverty from the poorest's viewpoint is a&#13;
&#13;
 convincing concept and should be the guideline for future&#13;
&#13;
 activities of this institution.        The time for top-down&#13;
&#13;
 approach is hopefully over and bottom-up is now the&#13;
&#13;
 normal approach.&#13;
&#13;
           The process has also shown how important it is&#13;
&#13;
 for this institution to be transparent.             NGOs and other&#13;
&#13;
 Bank critics still see the lack of transparency as one&#13;
&#13;
 major obstacle in dealing with the Bank.             To publish the&#13;
&#13;
 WDR draft on the Bank's external web site for comments&#13;

&#13;
 was an important step in the right direction, but much&#13;
&#13;
 more has to follow to solve the communication problems&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank faces.   The Bank has to significantly improve&#13;
&#13;
 its communication with the outside world, the so-called&#13;
&#13;
 outside world.    Actually, this is a wrong but&#13;
&#13;
 unfortunately often heard term as there is no outside&#13;
&#13;
 world or inside world.     The Bank is not operating in a&#13;
&#13;
 vacuum.&#13;
&#13;
           Therefore, to reach outer critics, this should&#13;
&#13;
 not only be the task of External Affairs and to actually&#13;
&#13;
 show what the Bank is doing, the good, but also the bad&#13;
&#13;
 should be transparent.&#13;
&#13;
           Now the real challenge lies in front of us.       We&#13;
&#13;
 have to operationalize the WDR to make it actually work.&#13;
&#13;
 The preparation of this massive document was already a&#13;
&#13;
 huge undertaking and congratulations to all participants&#13;
&#13;
 that to actually live with the WDR will be much more&#13;
&#13;
 difficult.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much.&#13;

&#13;
 document from several points of view.           This document&#13;
&#13;
 primarily in my view sets the basic features of the&#13;
&#13;
 personality of the World Bank Group in coming years.            And&#13;
&#13;
 the authors of the report, Mr. Chairman, in the ancient&#13;
&#13;
 tradition of finding mantras or sutras as they used to&#13;
&#13;
 call it in Sanskrit coining phrases, they have done a&#13;
&#13;
 remarkable job because they have come across three&#13;
&#13;
 mantras -- opportunity, empowerment and security.&#13;
&#13;
            And by focusing on empowerment and security as&#13;
&#13;
 much as opportunity, the report seeks to break fresh&#13;
&#13;
 grounds.     The analysis presented throughout the report&#13;
&#13;
 makes it clear that while growth and market forces are&#13;
&#13;
 important for reduction of poverty, by themselves they&#13;
&#13;
 may prove unequal to the task.         The experience of the&#13;
&#13;
 developing countries over the last decade has been a&#13;
&#13;
 mixed one.     We have see spectacular progress, on the one&#13;
&#13;
 hand, and depressing failures on the other.           There seems&#13;
&#13;
 to be no single set of policies that have worked.&#13;
&#13;
            Internal issues like governance and&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic stability are tempered with external&#13;
&#13;
 factors like inadequate access to international markets,&#13;
&#13;
 volatile capital flows, et cetera.          Under these&#13;
&#13;
 circumstances, there is a need to take a fresh look at&#13;
&#13;
 the literature available and the different experiences&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 that our countries have undergone.        The report makes an&#13;
&#13;
 effort at doing this, but in the end it is not satisfying&#13;
&#13;
 since it does not pursue the distribution idea to its&#13;
&#13;
 logical conclusions.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, at the outset, I would refer to&#13;
&#13;
 the controversy between economic growth and poverty&#13;
&#13;
 because there seems to be a feeling that economic growth&#13;
&#13;
 by itself would achieve everything or that attack on&#13;
&#13;
 inequity by itself would remove poverty.           Economic growth&#13;
&#13;
 is essential for poverty reduction, since without it&#13;
&#13;
 average income cannot rise.      But the rate at which growth&#13;
&#13;
 is converted into poverty reduction is a crucial issue.&#13;
&#13;
 And this is possible, Mr. Chairman, only when the poor&#13;
&#13;
 share in the benefits, which is a function of income&#13;
&#13;
 distribution.&#13;
&#13;
           It is in this background that we have to look&#13;
&#13;
 at economic growth and also at inequity.           And if we look&#13;
&#13;
 at this situation in different countries, we feel that&#13;
&#13;
 the traditional trickle down economics is inadequate not&#13;
&#13;
 only for economic growth but certainly for equity.&#13;
&#13;
           And, therefore, what was necessary in this&#13;
&#13;
 report that the focused areas of opportunity, empowerment&#13;
&#13;
 and security which are fundamentally complementary could&#13;
&#13;
 have been developed further in a manner that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 countries could take better decisions at the national&#13;
&#13;
 level.&#13;
&#13;
             Let me identify the issue, Mr. Chairman.           The&#13;
&#13;
 basic issue, in my view, from the perspective of&#13;
&#13;
 developing economies is that we have three gaps.              The&#13;
&#13;
 first gap is the shortage of savings, savings/investment&#13;
&#13;
 gap.     The second gap is shortage of foreign currency, a&#13;
&#13;
 foreign current supply-driven gap; and the third gap is&#13;
&#13;
 the skill gap, the shortage of, you can say, technology,&#13;
&#13;
 a shortage of drafting development strategies, a shortage&#13;
&#13;
 of personnel who are qualified to handle that technology,&#13;
&#13;
 to handle that skill.&#13;
&#13;
             Now it is here that the issue has to be&#13;
&#13;
 addressed if we have to attack poverty.              And I am not&#13;
&#13;
 very happy at the omission of the role of the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
 in this report in addressing these three issues.              Of&#13;
&#13;
 course, the primary actor is the national government, and&#13;
&#13;
 the national government must play that role.              But what&#13;
&#13;
 would the Bank do?     The basic questions are three.&#13;
&#13;
             Is the Bank using all its resources to address&#13;
&#13;
 these gaps?    Is the Bank using all its energies in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of knowledge, in terms of its scientific personnel, in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of acting as the center for technology transfer, in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of acting as a partner with a number of agencies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 operating in the world to transfer that skill to&#13;
&#13;
 developing countries?&#13;
&#13;
            And the third, which is equally important, are&#13;
&#13;
 its internal systems, like CAS, PRSP, HIPC Initiative and&#13;
&#13;
 all that to which has been referred to in the&#13;
&#13;
 introduction to this report.        And this is very important.&#13;
&#13;
            We are aware of the fact, Mr. Chairman, that it&#13;
&#13;
 would have been all right if we could have made a&#13;
&#13;
 hierarchy.    Yes, it would have been all right.       But the&#13;
&#13;
 hierarchies will differ between China and India, between&#13;
&#13;
 India and Pakistan or India or Indonesia, or whichever&#13;
&#13;
 country you take, because it depends upon the light in&#13;
&#13;
 which each country's genius has developed in tackling&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.&#13;
&#13;
            But the most important development which the&#13;
&#13;
 report does not mention today is that compared to the&#13;
&#13;
 1990s and earlier years, the culture of poverty has&#13;
&#13;
 broken.    Today, the large number of poor are no longer&#13;
&#13;
 blaming fate for poverty.       They are asking for&#13;
&#13;
 opportunities.    They are asking for security.       They are&#13;
&#13;
 asking for empowerment.      And this is a major development.&#13;
&#13;
 And it is necessary, therefore, to accelerate the pace of&#13;
&#13;
 this development.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
             My fears are, Mr. Chairman, that if we do not&#13;
&#13;
 employ opportunity, empowerment and security as&#13;
&#13;
 fundamentally complementary concepts into developing a&#13;
&#13;
 viable and coherent strategy, this report -- if, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, you will recall when Professor Stiglitz was&#13;
&#13;
 here and Ravi Kanbur was here, I had mentioned that is&#13;
&#13;
 this report going to be the delight of the professional&#13;
&#13;
 economists or of development planners and also of those&#13;
&#13;
 who have the task of implementing poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 programs.    The question remains.      These strategies need&#13;
&#13;
 to be developed, to move to that direction.&#13;
&#13;
             The other features which I thought need to be -&#13;
&#13;
 - this had been referred to and I am looking at it from&#13;
&#13;
 the perspective of South Asia, Kerala is singled out as a&#13;
&#13;
 state of India which has different characteristics and&#13;
&#13;
 features from the rest of other states of India and even&#13;
&#13;
 within that region.&#13;
&#13;
             Now while this is not spreading, why Kerala has&#13;
&#13;
 not been replicated, is the issue that we need to answer&#13;
&#13;
 if we are looking at population control, if we are&#13;
&#13;
 looking at literacy and health care.&#13;
&#13;
             The other thing which is missing -- this is a&#13;
&#13;
 good example given -- but the other thing which is&#13;
&#13;
 missing are certain natural factors.          This is there in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 the last chapter -- sorry, Part IV when we are talking&#13;
&#13;
 about managing economic crisis and natural disasters.&#13;
&#13;
            I give you an example, Mr. Chairman.           I come&#13;
&#13;
 from Bihar, and in North Bihar the floods visit every&#13;
&#13;
 year.    And what we find there in the analysis is that you&#13;
&#13;
 know how many persons get drowned, what is the flood&#13;
&#13;
 relief work, how much value of crops have been damaged&#13;
&#13;
 and so on.    But the fact remains that the poor lose their&#13;
&#13;
 houses, those who are one dollar a day.             Their houses&#13;
&#13;
 collapse fast, and next year whatever is their savings,&#13;
&#13;
 they have to build that house.        So, they are in the&#13;
&#13;
 syndrome of grinding poverty.&#13;
&#13;
            Now the lesson is do we devise plans where it&#13;
&#13;
 is nature versus poverty?      I am not talking about&#13;
&#13;
 grandiose plans for flood control, but where you upscale&#13;
&#13;
 the housing of the poor, which has a chain reactions.&#13;
&#13;
 Would the CAS address such problems?          Now that is the&#13;
&#13;
 issue.&#13;
&#13;
            And I am saying it not because of floods alone,&#13;
&#13;
 but there are similar situations where nature generates a&#13;
&#13;
 cycle of poverty and man is helpless.          What answer do we&#13;
&#13;
 have?&#13;
&#13;
            Therefore, Mr. Chairman, the need for a pro-&#13;
&#13;
 poor approach to poverty reduction is self-evident and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 needs to be met.    I give you another example, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, and this is related to agriculture.       And this&#13;
&#13;
 example I had given to the team informally when they had&#13;
&#13;
 called on me.&#13;
&#13;
           We went in India for land reforms because we&#13;
&#13;
 felt that land reforms are essential for equity and also&#13;
&#13;
 for economic growth.     And we had a large number of&#13;
&#13;
 landlords who didn't want to part with their land, going&#13;
&#13;
 to the courts, district courts, executive courts to start&#13;
&#13;
 with.   And we came across a very dedicated political&#13;
&#13;
 leader who insisted on the Cabinet of that state&#13;
&#13;
 government to issue a circular, which very clearly said&#13;
&#13;
 that whenever a revenue officer is in doubt as to whether&#13;
&#13;
 legally the claim is more of the landlord or of the poor,&#13;
&#13;
 he will decide in favor of the poor.&#13;
&#13;
           Now are we learning from that kind of&#13;
&#13;
 experience?    Are we sending our resources to the poor?&#13;
&#13;
 Are we making interventions on behalf of the poor and in&#13;
&#13;
 favor of the poor, whether it is multi-nationals versus&#13;
&#13;
 the poor or the suppliers versus the poor and things of&#13;
&#13;
 that nature?&#13;
&#13;
           Now I come to some of the statements which have&#13;
&#13;
 been made in respect of India.        There seems to be an&#13;
&#13;
 error in paragraph 5.35 where it is stated that the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 annual cost of primary education for one child represents&#13;
&#13;
 30, 40 days of wages for a rural laborer in northern&#13;
&#13;
 India.   In view of the fact that primary education is&#13;
&#13;
 free, it is our understanding that what the author meant&#13;
&#13;
 is opportunity cost and not annual cost.           Possibly I am&#13;
&#13;
 giving him the benefit of the doubt; I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
           We disagree with the statement in the last&#13;
&#13;
 sentence of paragraph 5.45 about a teacher devoting an&#13;
&#13;
 average of one minute of teaching time to each student&#13;
&#13;
 per year in northern India.      A certain degree of romantic&#13;
&#13;
 statements like that makes the report very readable or&#13;
&#13;
 dramatic, but does not explain the fact or does not&#13;
&#13;
 adhere to the truth.&#13;
&#13;
           This statement, I again concede the benefit of&#13;
&#13;
 doubt, may be based on anecdotal evidence.           Similarly,&#13;
&#13;
 there are harsh generalizations on Bihar's notoriously&#13;
&#13;
 harsh prison system.    I think this harsh has gone into&#13;
&#13;
 the system of making judgment in Box 6.2, which deserves&#13;
&#13;
 to be deleted.&#13;
&#13;
           There is another box item, 7.6, which though&#13;
&#13;
 ending on an optimistic note, using very strong language&#13;
&#13;
 about alleged landlord hegemony and social structures&#13;
&#13;
 prevalent in some villages of UP.        There may be a lack of&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 understanding of entrenched cost system or things of that&#13;
&#13;
 nature might have led to this language.&#13;
&#13;
            In view of the happy tone of its conclusion,&#13;
&#13;
 this needs editing.     Similarly, Mr. Chairman, the report&#13;
&#13;
 needs to use the Voices of the Poor, not to add beauty to&#13;
&#13;
 the document in the sense of presentation.              That would be&#13;
&#13;
 doing some kind of -- what should I say -- hurt to the&#13;
&#13;
 poor, because it is a seminal document.              Unless it is&#13;
&#13;
 largely for purposes of portraying a situation where&#13;
&#13;
 correct policy decisions could be taken.&#13;
&#13;
            I would also like to make a reference, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, to the gender issue because I feel that it is&#13;
&#13;
 the women who have to bear the burden of the system of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.     And this report, according to me, is weak on&#13;
&#13;
 gender.    And this is something which I thought needs to&#13;
&#13;
 be emphasized.&#13;
&#13;
            I had, Mr. Chairman, the pleasure of going&#13;
&#13;
 through the report of a leader from the United States who&#13;
&#13;
 visited India recently, and her report has been&#13;
&#13;
 published.     This lady is Carol Wagner Vilianos&#13;
&#13;
 [phonetic].    She is a senior member of the League of&#13;
&#13;
 Women Voters, and you are aware, Mr. Chairman, that the&#13;
&#13;
 League of Women Voters have rendered a great service to&#13;
&#13;
 the cause of gender in this great country.&#13;

&#13;
           And this report led to one kind of&#13;
&#13;
 understanding of empowerment, which is unique to India,&#13;
&#13;
 and I am not saying that every country should adopt it,&#13;
&#13;
 although that is the conclusion of Ms. Vilianos.            But I&#13;
&#13;
 thought I would mention that.&#13;
&#13;
           She had the pleasure of interacting with&#13;
&#13;
 several of the 39,000 women of Rajasthan who are elected&#13;
&#13;
 Punjab members in that state.      And she has recorded a&#13;
&#13;
 story, told by one women, that pointed up what we see as&#13;
&#13;
 the biggest problem.    I referred a little while to the&#13;
&#13;
 caste system.   And we have an hierarchal society in&#13;
&#13;
 several states.   And the highest are the Brahmins.           And&#13;
&#13;
 here is a lady, a Punjab member, elected member who was&#13;
&#13;
 asked to mediate a dispute between a Brahmin and a person&#13;
&#13;
 of a low caste.   She mediated this dispute successfully,&#13;
&#13;
 but when she came home her father-in-law was incensed&#13;
&#13;
 that she would stoop so low as to try to resolve&#13;
&#13;
 something in favor of this other caste, which she should&#13;
&#13;
 have been resolving it in favor of the Brahmin.&#13;
&#13;
           And instead of being diffident, the daughter-&#13;
&#13;
 in-law said to the father-in-law, I am quoting that,&#13;
&#13;
 "When I am in my elected official role, I am not your&#13;
&#13;
 daughter-in-law; I am elected official.            When I am at&#13;
&#13;
 home I am your daughter-in-law."&#13;

&#13;
            When the World Bank devises a program for&#13;
&#13;
 development or formulates CAS, it will not act for the&#13;
&#13;
 Brahmin, the nationals, but for the poor, as this lady&#13;
&#13;
 did.   But that is another point.       The main point, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, is that unless we don't go for skill building,&#13;
&#13;
 whether it is political empowerment, whether it is&#13;
&#13;
 technical empowerment among the women, the poverty&#13;
&#13;
 syndrome will not go into history; they will remain in&#13;
&#13;
 society.   And that point is absolutely clear.&#13;
&#13;
            And, therefore, I feel that the WDR should give&#13;
&#13;
 full account to this issue.&#13;
&#13;
            Mr. Chairman, I have a few more points and I&#13;
&#13;
 will conclude.    The two chapters on empowerment are&#13;
&#13;
 generally well written, except for some of the&#13;
&#13;
 questionable analysis which I have referred to.       And I&#13;
&#13;
 commend this time and I also commend the approach that in&#13;
&#13;
 my view floats from this writing, the need to privatize&#13;
&#13;
 fund allocations so that the needs of the poor are taking&#13;
&#13;
 care of, enforce accountability, have a merit-based&#13;
&#13;
 recruitment and promotion structure, streamlined&#13;
&#13;
 procedures, disseminate information and bring about&#13;
&#13;
 transparency.    It has been correctly pointed out that&#13;
&#13;
 decentralization is to be pursued, not as a goal by&#13;
&#13;
 itself but because it promotes accountability.        Steps&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 must be taken to promote the active involvement of the&#13;
&#13;
 poor and this by giving them an active leverage in the&#13;
&#13;
 process.&#13;
&#13;
            The importance of a limitation of building&#13;
&#13;
 social capital, whether bonding, linking or bridging,&#13;
&#13;
 cannot be underestimated.       They need to be scaled up in&#13;
&#13;
 various ways so that while the negative connotations that&#13;
&#13;
 hold back the poor are kept in check and the positive&#13;
&#13;
 ones encouraged, administrative structures will have to&#13;
&#13;
 be scaled down, refashioned, transaction costs lowered&#13;
&#13;
 and efficacy enhanced.      The political, administrative and&#13;
&#13;
 social environment must be an inclusive one and&#13;
&#13;
 participation and decision-making genuinely broad-based.&#13;
&#13;
 We feel that the reference to religion as a cementing&#13;
&#13;
 force, cutting across social and economic areas, seem to&#13;
&#13;
 be taken up in a manner that does not give the&#13;
&#13;
 fundamentalists a bigger say in tightening the control&#13;
&#13;
 over the progressive forces because there are a large&#13;
&#13;
 number of countries in the world where this phenomenon is&#13;
&#13;
 prevalent.&#13;
&#13;
            And we have to support the moderate forces, the&#13;
&#13;
 progressive forces.     I thought that a value judgment&#13;
&#13;
 needs to be made.&#13;

&#13;
             The report reached conclusions based on&#13;
&#13;
 quantifications of subjective perceptions rather than&#13;
&#13;
 objective results, for example, Chapter 6 to link the&#13;
&#13;
 level of corruption and level of bureaucratic delays to&#13;
&#13;
 merit best recruitment.     It is not that simple, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman.    Corruption is far too deep-rooted and&#13;
&#13;
 sometimes one wonders whether best recruitments will&#13;
&#13;
 remove corruption.    It will certainly help but the legal&#13;
&#13;
 system, the system of punishment, the system of reward,&#13;
&#13;
 the salary structure all are important.&#13;
&#13;
             Then, there is also an attempt to establish a&#13;
&#13;
 rule of law index.    And I have not followed that.           It is&#13;
&#13;
 something which you have to feel, something which the&#13;
&#13;
 society has to have in its environment.             And there are&#13;
&#13;
 institutions to be built up in this case and I am all for&#13;
&#13;
 that.&#13;
&#13;
             But I thought that there should be no attempt&#13;
&#13;
 at quantification because I don't think it is either&#13;
&#13;
 practical or worthwhile.      In fact, these attempts reduce&#13;
&#13;
 the credibility of the report and open it to the charges&#13;
&#13;
 of bias.    There is no need for that.&#13;
&#13;
             We disagree with the conclusions reached in&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph 7.50 that preferential policies backfire by&#13;
&#13;
 reinforcing the negative stereotypes of liabilities of&#13;

&#13;
 the disadvantaged, because we have a different experience&#13;
&#13;
 and the experience guaranteed under the constitution of&#13;
&#13;
 India.&#13;
&#13;
             We also do not agree with the statement made in&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph 7.52 that such policies can create tensions&#13;
&#13;
 between the favored and the others.         As with castes in&#13;
&#13;
 north India, I thought this is very superficial.&#13;
&#13;
             At the same time, in the same paragraph, it&#13;
&#13;
 accepts that affirmative action does not lead to loss of&#13;
&#13;
 efficiency.    I thought that there is some problem of&#13;
&#13;
 understanding.    In fact, when one reads Box 7.8, it&#13;
&#13;
 illustrates the positive experience of affirmative action&#13;
&#13;
 in India.    There are difficulties in this approach but at&#13;
&#13;
 different times legislative and government action must&#13;
&#13;
 promote social change.     The evolution of slavery in this&#13;
&#13;
 country is a case in point.&#13;
&#13;
             The report should have dealt with the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 approach to its activities in the low-income and middle-&#13;
&#13;
 income countries which have been experiencing increased&#13;
&#13;
 cost of doing business with the Bank.          I thought that&#13;
&#13;
 somewhere this is necessary and this conforms to my&#13;
&#13;
 earlier point, Mr. Chairman, that is, is the Bank doing&#13;
&#13;
 enough?   Are we satisfied on that point?&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            And let me end, Mr. Chairman, that the primary&#13;
&#13;
 responsibility for attacking poverty has to be with the&#13;
&#13;
 national governments, because the governments of&#13;
&#13;
 countries which have a large number of people need to&#13;
&#13;
 advocate a fundamental policy of promoting wider&#13;
&#13;
 education and vocational training, to help enable the&#13;
&#13;
 socially disadvantaged to participate in the market&#13;
&#13;
 economy.   They should also set up social safety nets&#13;
&#13;
 including unemployment insurance schemes and establish&#13;
&#13;
 effective relief measures for implementation in the event&#13;
&#13;
 of a crisis.&#13;
&#13;
            And it is, therefore, the lesson which the WDR&#13;
&#13;
 should give to its readers.      And I am glad that this WDR&#13;
&#13;
 debate has given us an opportunity not only to state the&#13;
&#13;
 state of poverty in the world but also to state clearly&#13;
&#13;
 the policy that the Bank and the national government&#13;
&#13;
 should follow.&#13;
&#13;
            Thank you very much.&#13;

            MR. SANDSTROM:   Thank you.&#13;

 and questions.   We will follow-up.&#13;

&#13;
           World Development Reports, Mr. Chairman, have&#13;
&#13;
 been very important documents, providing valuable inputs&#13;
&#13;
 to development thinking and policy-making.         Each report&#13;
&#13;
 has some insight to impart, to illuminate some area,&#13;
&#13;
 enhance knowledge and enrich policy-making in the area of&#13;
&#13;
 development.&#13;
&#13;
           But some of the reports stand out.        I recall&#13;
&#13;
 the report of 1990 on poverty, because of the content,&#13;
&#13;
 because of the theme it dealt with and today, the report&#13;
&#13;
 which we are discussing again on poverty, WDR 2000/01.&#13;
&#13;
           As my colleague Mr. Singh who has just&#13;
&#13;
 concluded his intervention, excellent intervention, we&#13;
&#13;
 come from a region and area which has the dubious&#13;
&#13;
 distinction of housing the largest number of poor in the&#13;
&#13;
 world -- extreme poor, 43.6 percent as well as poor which&#13;
&#13;
 are not extreme but still very much poor, 39 percent.&#13;
&#13;
           So, for us, Mr. Chairman, it is not an academic&#13;
&#13;
 exercise or not a research document only to adorn our&#13;
&#13;
 libraries or to be ready some time when one has run&#13;
&#13;
 through other more urgent documents, but it is something&#13;
&#13;
 which is a matter of vital importance to the people&#13;
&#13;
 living in our area.&#13;
&#13;
           Thus, this report is of far greater relevance&#13;
&#13;
 and importance to us than I think for many other people,&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 and this chair very much welcomes this opportunity to&#13;
&#13;
 discuss WDR 2000/01 and would like to commend the authors&#13;
&#13;
 of the report for the exceedingly informative, well-&#13;
&#13;
 written, excellent document which is informative, which&#13;
&#13;
 is comprehensive and which reflects solid ground covered&#13;
&#13;
 WDR 1990 and providing a more holistic and sustainable&#13;
&#13;
 foundation for the task of poverty alleviation in the&#13;
&#13;
 years to come.&#13;
&#13;
           In this regard, I would like to especially&#13;
&#13;
 commend and compliment members of the team, but&#13;
&#13;
 especially Nora Lustig, Ravi Kanbur who is no longer with&#13;
&#13;
 us but who did an excellent job, and Mr. Michael Walton.&#13;
&#13;
           As I was saying, Mr. Chairman, in our view this&#13;
&#13;
 report by taking a broader approach to deprivation has&#13;
&#13;
 provided the most invaluable survey of the landscape of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty and has come up with a comprehensive diagnostic&#13;
&#13;
 analysis, perhaps the most comprehensive analysis&#13;
&#13;
 available to date on the causes of poverty.        We are&#13;
&#13;
 grateful to the team that they have worked so hard.         And&#13;
&#13;
 I am grateful also to the explanations which have been&#13;
&#13;
 given today and also the statements which have been made&#13;
&#13;
 by colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, we very much agree with the three&#13;
&#13;
 components, the three pillars of action -- promoting&#13;

&#13;
 opportunity, facilitating empowerment and enhancing&#13;
&#13;
 security.    Indeed, these are the key.&#13;
&#13;
             And regarding promoting opportunity, we do&#13;
&#13;
 recognize, this chair recognizes that growth is of&#13;
&#13;
 crucial importance.    We have seen that unless there is&#13;
&#13;
 growth, there can be no poverty alleviation.         There can&#13;
&#13;
 be no two differences of opinion, but the important thing&#13;
&#13;
 is what we do with that growth.        What happens to that&#13;
&#13;
 growth?   So that is the important thing which brings the&#13;
&#13;
 question of justice, the question of distributive&#13;
&#13;
 mechanism and they are very important questions.         And we&#13;
&#13;
 should not gloss over them.&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Chairman, poverty is indeed a great problem&#13;
&#13;
 and is a colossal problem facing the world today.         In the&#13;
&#13;
 last five-and-a-half decades since the establishment of&#13;
&#13;
 the United Nations system and of these institutions,&#13;
&#13;
 developing countries, it must be admitted, have&#13;
&#13;
 experienced substantial economic progress.          The pace of&#13;
&#13;
 their development according to one estimate is three&#13;
&#13;
 times faster than that of industrialized countries a&#13;
&#13;
 century ago.&#13;
&#13;
             One can, as it has been done in this report,&#13;
&#13;
 cite in this context rising life expectancy, falling&#13;
&#13;
 infant mortality, increasing literacy and much improved&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 nutrition in the developing countries.          These indicators,&#13;
&#13;
 however, should not make us oblivious of the grim reality&#13;
&#13;
 that a fifth of the developing world's population goes&#13;
&#13;
 hungry every night; a quarter does not have access to&#13;
&#13;
 even a basic necessity like safe drinking water; and the&#13;
&#13;
 third bears the cross of abject poverty.            Their life can&#13;
&#13;
 be termed at best as a sub-human existence.&#13;
&#13;
            On the other hand, the richest billion people&#13;
&#13;
 in the world have 60 times the income of the poorest&#13;
&#13;
 billion.   Viewed through a comparative perspective, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, we are confronted with a somber situation.&#13;
&#13;
 Life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa is just 50 years;&#13;
&#13;
 in Japan it is almost 80.      Mortality among children under&#13;
&#13;
 five in South Asia exceeds 170 deaths per 1,000.            In&#13;
&#13;
 Sweden, it is fewer than 10.&#13;
&#13;
            More than 100 million children in the&#13;
&#13;
 developing world lack access even to primary education;&#13;
&#13;
 in the industrialized countries anything less than&#13;
&#13;
 universal enrollment would rightly be regarded as&#13;
&#13;
 unacceptable.   The starkness of these contrasts, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, attest to the continuing toll of human&#13;
&#13;
 deprivation.    These contrasts are indeed disquieting.&#13;
&#13;
 There coexists in the world today enormous hunger and&#13;
&#13;
 unprecedented plenty.     today, we have a breath-taking&#13;
&#13;

 globalization of prosperity, side by side with the&#13;
&#13;
 depressing globalization of poverty.          The progress&#13;
&#13;
 mankind has achieved indicates its capacity to engineer&#13;
&#13;
 change.   The current magnitude of human deprivation can&#13;
&#13;
 be tackled only by designing a much better world.&#13;
&#13;
           My colleague, Mr. Singh, was referring to the&#13;
&#13;
 change in the culture.     The change in the culture, the&#13;
&#13;
 poor in the world today are not going to rest content&#13;
&#13;
 with their fate.   It is not acceptable morally,&#13;
&#13;
 ethically.   It is not accepted by any standard that&#13;
&#13;
 national or racial accidents of birth should become&#13;
&#13;
 permanent social and economic fate.         And this has got to&#13;
&#13;
 be changed, Mr. Chairman; the earlier, the better.&#13;
&#13;
 Otherwise, the price and costs will be too much and too&#13;
&#13;
 high.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, this report, as I said earlier,&#13;
&#13;
 comes up with a comprehensive diagnosis and analysis.&#13;
&#13;
 But given the complexity and comprehensiveness of the&#13;
&#13;
 findings, specific policy actions might take time to&#13;
&#13;
 identify and for years what is being prescribed will&#13;
&#13;
 remain a work in progress.      Nevertheless, in view of this&#13;
&#13;
 chair, the authors should not shy away, whenever&#13;
&#13;
 possible, to take a bolder approach in the final version&#13;
&#13;
 of the report to articulate a suitable set of alternative&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 policy proposals, scenarios and planning projection of&#13;
&#13;
 what is likely to happen if alternative proposals are&#13;
&#13;
 followed.    We believe that finding suitable policy&#13;
&#13;
 prescriptions in line with the thorough diagnosis on&#13;
&#13;
 causes of poverty should constitute the Bank's research&#13;
&#13;
 endeavor for years to come, because what has been done&#13;
&#13;
 today has to be taken as something as a continuing&#13;
&#13;
 process.    We will have to become more and more educated,&#13;
&#13;
 and we will be have to become wiser in light of&#13;
&#13;
 experience what has to be done.&#13;
&#13;
             And this humility, Mr. Chairman, I hope will&#13;
&#13;
 remain part of the attitude of the Bank and, at the same&#13;
&#13;
 time, Mr. Chairman, we will have to continue to work to&#13;
&#13;
 eliminate more areas which are still dark and see what&#13;
&#13;
 can be done.&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Chairman, in this regard, my colleague&#13;
&#13;
 Singh and my colleague Matthias Meyer have pointed out&#13;
&#13;
 that in this wonderful analysis, an assessment of the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank role and responsibility of the past is somewhat&#13;
&#13;
 missing.    I hope that this is not the result of excessive&#13;
&#13;
 humility or a sense of shame, because we must talk about&#13;
&#13;
 what we have been doing, because the World Bank as a&#13;
&#13;
 premier development institution has a very important role&#13;

&#13;
 to play, and it will be fair that that role is reflected,&#13;
&#13;
 good or bad, and lessons which we have learned.&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Chairman, I am very much happy with the&#13;
&#13;
 process of the formulation of this report.          The Voices of&#13;
&#13;
 the Poor is a wonderful way of hearing from those who are&#13;
&#13;
 affected.    Similarly, the fact that it was posted on the&#13;
&#13;
 web and so much opinion and so much views were generated&#13;
&#13;
 is something which is very, very helpful and laudable.&#13;
&#13;
 But we must admit that the electronic media is not&#13;
&#13;
 commonly available in most of the developing countries&#13;
&#13;
 where the large majority of the poor live.          Though we are&#13;
&#13;
 happy that the draft report was made available on the web&#13;
&#13;
 for worldwide consultation and comment, we also commend&#13;
&#13;
 that we must follow this so as to correct perception of&#13;
&#13;
 lack of transparency and participatory approach of this&#13;
&#13;
 institution.    But we would like to hear to what extent&#13;
&#13;
 this report incorporated the views, suggestions and&#13;
&#13;
 criticism expressed through the electronic media.&#13;
&#13;
             I am happy to learn that there have been&#13;
&#13;
 responses to what has been learned and what has been&#13;
&#13;
 said.   But I would like to know especially in reports&#13;
&#13;
 which were received from the developing countries and to&#13;
&#13;
 what extent they were considered and what has been done&#13;
&#13;
 to them by the authors of the report.&#13;

&#13;
           We are somewhat surprised, Mr. Chairman, that&#13;
&#13;
 there has been relatively less intervention of the World&#13;
&#13;
 Bank staff in the electronic discussions.          We thought&#13;
&#13;
 that the World Bank staff which has got all the&#13;
&#13;
 experience, which by admission of the Bank should have&#13;
&#13;
 participated and should have contributed more to the&#13;
&#13;
 thinking and deliberation.&#13;
&#13;
           The WDR should have been a great opportunity to&#13;
&#13;
 widely involve staff in calling on their deep expertise&#13;
&#13;
 and how best to attack poverty.       Last but not least, we&#13;
&#13;
 would wish that in the future the electronic consultation&#13;
&#13;
 of WDR and the core body of the draft report at least be&#13;
&#13;
 available in some other language as to ensure wider&#13;
&#13;
 dissemination.   It will cost money but I think this&#13;
&#13;
 expenditure is worth incurring.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, this chair is concerned with the&#13;
&#13;
 draft report's extent and bias, I would say, or I would&#13;
&#13;
 say orientation in several sections to the World Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 traditional market-driven rhetoric by taking an over-&#13;
&#13;
 arching exemption at strengthening of existing market&#13;
&#13;
 mechanisms most through minor tinkering with regulatory&#13;
&#13;
 mechanisms in low-income countries such as relaxing of&#13;
&#13;
 regulatory mechanisms for the private sector or as a last&#13;
&#13;
 resort by introducing safety nets which somehow or other&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 improve the lot of the poor to a great extent through&#13;
&#13;
 some sort of, I would say, trickle down.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, the important thing which has to&#13;
&#13;
 be considered is that in our present preoccupation and I&#13;
&#13;
 would say in our present idolatry of market mechanism, we&#13;
&#13;
 forget that only 30, 40 years ago the world was going in&#13;
&#13;
 a different way and it was not senseless.          There were&#13;
&#13;
 reasons for it.   There is no end of history, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, if we think that we have gone ahead now and the&#13;
&#13;
 socialistic and other thinking or other alternative modes&#13;
&#13;
 are banished forever; it is not true.         If the market&#13;
&#13;
 mechanism does not deliver, as there have been failures&#13;
&#13;
 in the past, there will be a throwback to older times.&#13;
&#13;
 So, we must realize that although the private sector&#13;
&#13;
 mechanism, market mechanism is something which is very,&#13;
&#13;
 very important -- and I fully subscribe to its&#13;
&#13;
 efficacies, its utility, its relevance -- but I feel that&#13;
&#13;
 we must also be aware of its weaknesses, especially in&#13;
&#13;
 the context of developing countries, where private&#13;
&#13;
 enterprise has not imbibed the culture of&#13;
&#13;
 entrepreneurism, where private enterprise is practicing&#13;
&#13;
 rent-seeking.&#13;
&#13;
           If we are judging Pakistan or some other&#13;
&#13;
 countries in the developing world from the standards of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 market players, capitalistic players in the United States&#13;
&#13;
 or the United Kingdom, it would be a mistake because in&#13;
&#13;
 our case we are still passing through a feudal age.     So,&#13;
&#13;
 too much store should not be put and we must realize the&#13;
&#13;
 limitations of the private sector in our countries.     They&#13;
&#13;
 may not be able to deliver for many years to come.     We&#13;
&#13;
 are not saying that they should not be encouraged to&#13;
&#13;
 deliver, but this is a real life limitation.&#13;
&#13;
           And then, as I said earlier, Mr. Chairman, we&#13;
&#13;
 must always know that there can be inherent weaknesses in&#13;
&#13;
 the market system and we must guard against them when we&#13;
&#13;
 are fighting any battle against poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           In the same vein, Mr. Chairman, although we&#13;
&#13;
 share the WDR's views that governments and low-income&#13;
&#13;
 countries in many cases are corrupt or bureaucratic and&#13;
&#13;
 unable to respond to the needs of the poor, it would be&#13;
&#13;
 unwise to suggest that private capital will in some way&#13;
&#13;
 by some magic mechanism bypass this corruption inertia&#13;
&#13;
 and lead to an improvement in the conditions of the poor&#13;
&#13;
 and usher in a year of prosperity and build a paradise.&#13;
&#13;
 It may not be possible.&#13;
&#13;
           Then we come along to the analysis which has&#13;
&#13;
 been underlying this report, wonderful analysis, but then&#13;
&#13;
 I think in some case some desegregation is required.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Especially the constituency I represent, we find that&#13;
&#13;
 sometimes policy prescriptions are combined for the&#13;
&#13;
 region, for example, North Africa and Middle East, and,&#13;
&#13;
 of course, we find Figure 3.4 and page 3.5.          But I think&#13;
&#13;
 there is need to segregate North Africa, which is very&#13;
&#13;
 different from the rest of the Middle East.&#13;
&#13;
           South Asia, very much similar, but the Middle&#13;
&#13;
 East and North Africa is different and there may be&#13;
&#13;
 different realities and there may be different&#13;
&#13;
 perceptions and there may be different problems which are&#13;
&#13;
 being faced and different prescriptions.           So, I think&#13;
&#13;
 there is need for greater desegregation of analysis.&#13;
&#13;
           We salute and compliment the authors of the&#13;
&#13;
 report for their candor in rightly highlighting at page&#13;
&#13;
 10.2 that trade reforms in developing countries have&#13;
&#13;
 failed to deliver their full benefit because they have&#13;
&#13;
 not been matched by trade reforms in the rich world.             We&#13;
&#13;
 are also pleased that the report has often highlighted&#13;
&#13;
 the positive impact of community driven initiatives&#13;
&#13;
 towards poverty alleviation in Chapters 5, 6 and 8.&#13;
&#13;
           However, we were somewhat surprised, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, that the example discussed in the report on&#13;
&#13;
 community-based development initiative focused almost&#13;
&#13;
 exclusively on the education sector, ignoring the&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 community's prominent role in other sectors.            I hope this&#13;
&#13;
 will be rectified in the final report.&#13;
&#13;
           Chapter 9 discusses the impact of economic&#13;
&#13;
 crisis on the poor world and greatly benefits from a&#13;
&#13;
 discussion of the World Bank's role, efforts and role in&#13;
&#13;
 designing a new financial architecture.            In this regard,&#13;
&#13;
 we are surprised that the debt relief initiative in which&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank played such a prominent role is relegated to the&#13;
&#13;
 last pages of the report.     The reader might not only be&#13;
&#13;
 worn out after reading 700 pages, of course there will be&#13;
&#13;
 400 at least in the printed form, but also would&#13;
&#13;
 incorrectly get the impression that it is not a priority&#13;
&#13;
 issue.&#13;
&#13;
           In this respect, the forthcoming G-8 meet in&#13;
&#13;
 Japan during July 21-23 rightly includes funding of the&#13;
&#13;
 debt relief as one major discussion item in its agenda.&#13;
&#13;
 And I am happy that reality is better than what has been&#13;
&#13;
 reflected in the pages of the report.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, the debt trap is something which&#13;
&#13;
 is a very, very serious problem which is being faced by&#13;
&#13;
 the world.   But so far we have seen that we are only&#13;
&#13;
 concentrating -- and, of course, the question of&#13;
&#13;
 selectivity is so important in this body -- we are only&#13;
&#13;
 concentrating on HIPC countries.       Of course, we think&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 that debt relief should become faster and deeper as far&#13;
&#13;
 as these countries are concerned.        But there are many,&#13;
&#13;
 many other countries which may not be HIPC countries,&#13;
&#13;
 including Pakistan, where most of the budget goes for&#13;
&#13;
 debt servicing, where a problem of debt is the greatest&#13;
&#13;
 impediment in the path of poverty alleviation efforts.&#13;
&#13;
 And one day, not too long in the future, I think quite&#13;
&#13;
 near, we will have to graduate from HIPC countries to&#13;
&#13;
 other countries and to do something sensible and&#13;
&#13;
 meaningful about their debt if we are really serious&#13;
&#13;
 about poverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
           Given the visibility and prominence of debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief, this chair believes that the section on debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief might benefit from further elaboration and&#13;
&#13;
 articulation of alternative policy proposals, scenarios&#13;
&#13;
 and planning projections     where there is likely to be&#13;
&#13;
 incidence on poverty, in case of lack of funding for debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief.   We must always bring out what would happen if&#13;
&#13;
 funding is not done in case of HIPC.         What would happen&#13;
&#13;
 if nothing is done in the case of other countries which&#13;
&#13;
 are suffering seriously from debt?&#13;
&#13;
           Attacking poverty without broader and deeper&#13;
&#13;
 debt relief is an elusive dream.&#13;

&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, may I now at the end come to a&#13;
&#13;
 problem which concerns me as a representative of my&#13;
&#13;
 country, Pakistan, to which I belong.         On paragraphs 5.8&#13;
&#13;
 and 5.9, one is talking about raising and allocating&#13;
&#13;
 resources for development, and then paragraph 5.26 reads&#13;
&#13;
 "Military spending in developing countries fell from 4.9&#13;
&#13;
 percent of GDP in 1990 to 2.4 percent in 1995.         In&#13;
&#13;
 several countries, this lower military spending permitted&#13;
&#13;
 greater spending on higher education and health".           That&#13;
&#13;
 is wonderful.   "But in other countries" -- and here is&#13;
&#13;
 the rub, Mr. Chairman -- "especially those experiencing&#13;
&#13;
 armed conflicts are facing unresolved tensions with&#13;
&#13;
 neighbors, military spending continues to cut into poor,&#13;
&#13;
 pro-poor spending".   This is very correct.&#13;
&#13;
           In fact, this is something which vindicates,&#13;
&#13;
 because it has been mentioned, "Between 1990 and 1997 in&#13;
&#13;
 Pakistan accounted for 23 percent of government spending&#13;
&#13;
 compared with 11 percent for both education and health".&#13;
&#13;
 Yes, this is something which very well highlights the&#13;
&#13;
 dilemma, the tragedy of those countries which are living&#13;
&#13;
 in a region where there are unresolved tensions with&#13;
&#13;
 neighbors.   The Government of Pakistan has been saying&#13;
&#13;
 so, solve those core problems.&#13;

&#13;
             Mr. Chairman, we have been saying that politics&#13;
&#13;
 should be kept out of these things.         We should not --&#13;
&#13;
 because I can start raising issues with my good friend,&#13;
&#13;
 Mr. Singh, because I can say, look, what is happening&#13;
&#13;
 with Pakistan and India?      This will be a most unfortunate&#13;
&#13;
 thing.   Why you should highlight Pakistan?         Could not&#13;
&#13;
 this very paragraph be there without mentioning one&#13;
&#13;
 member country?&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Chairman, my authorities take exception to&#13;
&#13;
 mention of Pakistan in this regard, although I think no&#13;
&#13;
 one would quarrel with how things are which has been&#13;
&#13;
 described here.    My only request would be that it should&#13;
&#13;
 be suitably changed or modified without, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 sacrificing what you want to say but by highlighting and&#13;
&#13;
 hitting the country which I represent.&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much for your&#13;
&#13;
 patience.    Again, I salute the authors of this report.&#13;
&#13;
 This report represents a very monumental work.         I hope&#13;
&#13;
 that lessons which have been set out in this report, the&#13;
&#13;
 policy prescriptions which have been suggested will&#13;
&#13;
 become guiding stars for us in years to come to fight the&#13;
&#13;
 menace of poverty and make the world a poverty free&#13;
&#13;
 world.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you very much.&#13;

&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM: Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           We have heard from three of you so far.        I have&#13;
&#13;
 ten more names on the list.      Luis Balduino is next.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. BALDUINO:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I will try to be very brief.         First of all, I&#13;
&#13;
 would like to welcome Mr. Stern.       This is his first&#13;
&#13;
 formal meeting at the Board and thank the staff who has&#13;
&#13;
 prepared this interesting report, interesting to read and&#13;
&#13;
 very rich in examples.&#13;
&#13;
           And it contains several very useful&#13;
&#13;
 recommendations in different parts. Generally, our main&#13;
&#13;
 uneasiness with the report is whether we are moving from&#13;
&#13;
 a somewhat coherent theoretical framework which may have&#13;
&#13;
 some shortcomings, but was largely viewed as valid and&#13;
&#13;
 containing the importance of growth and market reforms&#13;
&#13;
 and so on, to another one which is more fragmented and to&#13;
&#13;
 a large extent seems to be based on anecdotal evidence.&#13;
&#13;
 I think some other chairs have mentioned this extensive&#13;
&#13;
 recourse to anecdotal evident to support the reasoning&#13;
&#13;
 that was being made.&#13;
&#13;
           I think the message is less clear in the&#13;
&#13;
 question of the role of reform.       It is not clear, for&#13;
&#13;
 instance, if the report is proposing a kind of a&#13;
&#13;
 Washington consensus plus, just to use this expression&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 which I don't like, but at least it is convenient, or is&#13;
&#13;
 it in a sense kind of alternative to the Washington&#13;
&#13;
 consensus in terms of the ten points that are highlighted&#13;
&#13;
 on pages 4.2 and 4.3?&#13;
&#13;
           I have examined the language in Chapter 4 and&#13;
&#13;
 also in Chapter 2, and it does not come totally clear,&#13;
&#13;
 and also in the introductory remarks by Nora and Michael,&#13;
&#13;
 I notice some nuances there.&#13;
&#13;
           There are two implicit questions there.      One&#13;
&#13;
 was whether reforms delivered or not growth.       And then,&#13;
&#13;
 there were examples saying yes and saying no.      In the&#13;
&#13;
 end, apparently on average the answer would be no, but&#13;
&#13;
 there is a phrase saying this, but there are other&#13;
&#13;
 phrases making a nuance.&#13;
&#13;
           The second question is whether the reforms have&#13;
&#13;
 delivered poverty alleviation, and then there are several&#13;
&#13;
 examples, some saying yes and others saying no.      One&#13;
&#13;
 question that comes to mind is in the cases where reforms&#13;
&#13;
 failed totally, should countries simply abandon those&#13;
&#13;
 reforms and try something else or should they simply try&#13;
&#13;
 again?   And should they have those ten points as a&#13;
&#13;
 minimum standard from which to build this new approach&#13;
&#13;
 that you are proposing or can they disregard them and try&#13;
&#13;
 to go to this other approach on empowerment and listening&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 to the voices of the poor as a way to deliver growth?&#13;
&#13;
 Could that deliver growth?&#13;
&#13;
           So, this is the main question.           And there are&#13;
&#13;
 some phrases which seem a bit based on a moral&#13;
&#13;
 imperative, for instance, that societies have an&#13;
&#13;
 obligation to look after certain segments of the&#13;
&#13;
 population in a transition period.        We think we have to&#13;
&#13;
 debate whether it is a good idea to base a report on many&#13;
&#13;
 moral imperatives as there are contained in this report.&#13;
&#13;
 I will come to this a little later explaining what I&#13;
&#13;
 mean.&#13;
&#13;
           A second set of concerns relates to the Voices&#13;
&#13;
 of the Poor.   We think it is a very good idea, the&#13;
&#13;
 methodology of using these surveys, but there may be some&#13;
&#13;
 tricky questions on drawing conclusions.           One is the&#13;
&#13;
 question of the sizes of the sample.         Murilo has made&#13;
&#13;
 this issue on other occasions.       Another one is the nature&#13;
&#13;
 of the responses, and this chair made this point also in&#13;
&#13;
 a CODE meeting previously.&#13;
&#13;
           When we look at many of the responses -- and I&#13;
&#13;
 myself being a representative of a middle-class&#13;
&#13;
 developing country -- what I sense is that those&#13;
&#13;
 responses do not seem to be uniquely responses of the&#13;
&#13;
 poor people; that many people who are not poor also feel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the same way as regards security, some anxiety, many of&#13;
&#13;
 those elements that are contained in those responses.&#13;
&#13;
 Therefore, those responses alone would not be a&#13;
&#13;
 definitional element of what poverty is, unless you were&#13;
&#13;
 stretching the definition of poverty maybe too far.&#13;
&#13;
           A third point is it has to do with the&#13;
&#13;
 perception of reality versus reality itself in the&#13;
&#13;
 responses.   And there is a recent study by the LAC&#13;
&#13;
 Region, "Security of the Future in a Global Economy",&#13;
&#13;
 which has been quoted, but maybe it has not been used&#13;
&#13;
 fully in this report, which is very interesting saying&#13;
&#13;
 that when you look at the objective facts, what you see&#13;
&#13;
 is that in the 1990s there is less insecurity.      The&#13;
&#13;
 objective situation seems to be improving but at the same&#13;
&#13;
 time people are less happy.      And then that report raises&#13;
&#13;
 the question:   Why is this so?&#13;
&#13;
           In the limit, we have to understand that we may&#13;
&#13;
 not be in a position to institutionalize happiness and&#13;
&#13;
 the governments can act upon objective facts and try to&#13;
&#13;
 improve objective situations, but then in the end there&#13;
&#13;
 may be always a certain room where there is an&#13;
&#13;
 existential uneasiness in societies, and some societies&#13;
&#13;
 are more pessimistic than others, that we perhaps it is&#13;
&#13;
 not possible to grab.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
             Now on the chapters of empowerment, many of the&#13;
&#13;
 analyses contained in those chapters we share.      We fully&#13;
&#13;
 share the importance of democracy of good governance, et&#13;
&#13;
 cetera.   Although when it comes to formulating&#13;
&#13;
 strategies, one has to be very careful at what the goal&#13;
&#13;
 of the Bank is, because here we are very often in the&#13;
&#13;
 political realm, and there is not only the question of&#13;
&#13;
 the mandate of the Bank in relation to the Articles of&#13;
&#13;
 Agreement but also there is a reputational risk for the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank to entangle itself in some kind of political&#13;
&#13;
 processes.&#13;
&#13;
             And I would like to quote just one example that&#13;
&#13;
 came out recently in the Interim PRSP for Sao Tome and&#13;
&#13;
 Principe.    That text mentioned, the assessment made by&#13;
&#13;
 the staff, that as the government was forced to initiate&#13;
&#13;
 a participatory consultative process, this process alone&#13;
&#13;
 was creating a lot of expectations in society and this&#13;
&#13;
 was leading to a lot of social unrest.&#13;
&#13;
             Now if later on the funds that will be supplied&#13;
&#13;
 by the Bank will not match those expectations, what you&#13;
&#13;
 can have is the Bank by forcing countries in certain&#13;
&#13;
 processes to end up in destabilizing governments and you&#13;
&#13;
 may be in a worse off situation than you were in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 first place.    So, it is a very tricky question.      It is a&#13;
&#13;
 very important one that we have to think carefully about.&#13;
&#13;
             So, therefore, we don't tend to support too&#13;
&#13;
 extensive strategies of the Bank based on this kind of&#13;
&#13;
 approach.    These chapters contain some issues, for&#13;
&#13;
 instance, the question of affirmative action where there&#13;
&#13;
 is a debate whether that is really tantamount to equality&#13;
&#13;
 of opportunity or the contrary.         There is a debate on&#13;
&#13;
 this and, therefore, the report maybe should avoid going&#13;
&#13;
 into areas where, in a sense, it is crystallizing a&#13;
&#13;
 certain political view.&#13;
&#13;
             I think it would be important for the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
 have recommendations which are common ground for&#13;
&#13;
 different spectrums of the political reality, because if&#13;
&#13;
 we agree that democracy is important, we have to&#13;
&#13;
 understand that there will be alteration of power in&#13;
&#13;
 countries.     And when you have a set of recommendations&#13;
&#13;
 that are exclusively from one type of political wing,&#13;
&#13;
 what will happen when the legitimate political process&#13;
&#13;
 brings to power governments with a different view, the&#13;
&#13;
 role of government to the role of taxes and so on?&#13;
&#13;
             So, this aspect perhaps should be taken out of&#13;
&#13;
 the report.&#13;

                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
             We found the section on global actions is a&#13;
&#13;
 very important one because it is a recognition that a lot&#13;
&#13;
 of things happen outside the countries of which countries&#13;
&#13;
 have no control.&#13;
&#13;
             I would make three specific comments here.        On&#13;
&#13;
 page 11.14, page 11.36, there is language that seems to&#13;
&#13;
 imply that the authors of the report are endorsing the&#13;
&#13;
 Meltzer Report by criticizing aid going to non low-income&#13;
&#13;
 countries.     I don't know if that was the intention or&#13;
&#13;
 not.     But I wonder of the coherence of this with other&#13;
&#13;
 policies of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
             The second one has to do with trade.        We very&#13;
&#13;
 much welcome the reference to trade.           We think the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 has a very important role here in demonstrating the&#13;
&#13;
 relationship of trade barriers in developed countries and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.     And this is in line with the mandate of the&#13;
&#13;
 Development Committee.&#13;
&#13;
             We think that the recommendation that some of&#13;
&#13;
 these could be solved through negotiations is a bit&#13;
&#13;
 naive.     Maybe, as developing countries become more&#13;
&#13;
 outspoken on their interests, at some point we will have&#13;
&#13;
 that.    I have participated personally on trade&#13;
&#13;
 negotiations and what I see is that it is a very brutal&#13;
&#13;
 game.    It is totally different from what we see, for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 instance, in this type of context.        And many developing&#13;
&#13;
 countries, even when they participate, they simply do not&#13;
&#13;
 feel secure enough to really stretch their interests to&#13;
&#13;
 the limit and some which did so, for instance, in the&#13;
&#13;
 Uruguay Round were always portrayed as representing&#13;
&#13;
 backwardness and things like that.&#13;
&#13;
           And finally, there is a very interesting&#13;
&#13;
 reference to the framework for aid flows, and it&#13;
&#13;
 reiterates the findings of the theory of aid&#13;
&#13;
 effectiveness, and I think it is good that this is a step&#13;
&#13;
 for future policy change.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we should keep going for a while, but&#13;
&#13;
 then staff should come back also and respond to some of&#13;
&#13;
 these points.&#13;
&#13;
           Zhu Xian, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. ZHU:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           Like others, I think this is a good report with&#13;
&#13;
 many enlightening views.     The experience and the lessons&#13;
&#13;
 summarized will provide us with food for thought,&#13;
&#13;
 probably not now but maybe for a long time to come.       I&#13;
&#13;
 would like to commend the team for its excellent job.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
             Let me first turn to some general comments and&#13;
&#13;
 then I may be more specific.&#13;
&#13;
             First, on growth and distribution:      I fully&#13;
&#13;
 agree with the views as referred to in the report that&#13;
&#13;
 promoting opportunities through economic expansion,&#13;
&#13;
 making the market work better for poor people and&#13;
&#13;
 building up their assets are key to reducing poverty.         I&#13;
&#13;
 also share the view that enhancing the security by&#13;
&#13;
 reducing poor people's vulnerability and helping them&#13;
&#13;
 cope with adverse shocks is essential for reducing&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.&#13;
&#13;
             And I think that to promote opportunities to&#13;
&#13;
 enhance security may be well seen as another version of&#13;
&#13;
 our continued classic debate over the growth versus&#13;
&#13;
 distribution.    I also agree with the points that there is&#13;
&#13;
 no single universal blueprint for implementing the&#13;
&#13;
 proposed strategy, opportunity, empowerment and enhanced&#13;
&#13;
 security.    As the report argues rightly, there is no&#13;
&#13;
 hierarchy in importance, rather elements are deeply&#13;
&#13;
 complementary.&#13;
&#13;
             But in practice, the question may still be&#13;
&#13;
 there that operationally whether we could try effectively&#13;
&#13;
 to implement all these three elements at the same time&#13;
&#13;
 with the same emphasis and same weight probably achieving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 satisfactorily the same results.       I understand that&#13;
&#13;
 strong growth and fair distribution are the most&#13;
&#13;
 important factors of the pro-poor economic development.&#13;
&#13;
 But history has proved that there is no single country&#13;
&#13;
 that could get rid of poverty without strong growth.&#13;
&#13;
            On the other hand, restructuring of any&#13;
&#13;
 country's existing wealth redistribution system is much&#13;
&#13;
 more difficult if not impossible, developing countries,&#13;
&#13;
 industrial countries alike.      Resistance is bound to come&#13;
&#13;
 from every interest group and likely one of the likely&#13;
&#13;
 results is that those who are unable to loudly voice&#13;
&#13;
 their interests or less organized themselves may suffer&#13;
&#13;
 the most from the complex political decision-making&#13;
&#13;
 process, particularly with redistribution.&#13;
&#13;
            But redistribution can be changed at the margin&#13;
&#13;
 over time more in favor of the poor if the growth rate is&#13;
&#13;
 higher than otherwise.    At least, that has been the&#13;
&#13;
 experience in East Asia including countries like China.&#13;
&#13;
            Let me now turn briefly on ownership of&#13;
&#13;
 reforms.   I think paragraph 4.4 identifies some courses&#13;
&#13;
 that led to reform failures, and I agree with the view&#13;
&#13;
 that reforms should be designed and implemented in a way&#13;
&#13;
 which is careful, measured and tailored to economic,&#13;
&#13;
 social and political circumstances of a country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 However, I assume that by now we all agree that ownership&#13;
&#13;
 of reform is of vital importance.        In other words, the&#13;
&#13;
 reform agenda, no matter how carefully designed and&#13;
&#13;
 sequenced, as long as they are not fully owned by the&#13;
&#13;
 country or without sufficient public support and&#13;
&#13;
 understanding of the majority in a country, they can&#13;
&#13;
 never be sustainable, if not unachievable.&#13;
&#13;
           By the same token, I agree with the point in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of equity versus efficiency that results-oriented&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction strategy should be better supported.&#13;
&#13;
 Poor people, regardless of their nationalities,&#13;
&#13;
 religions, ideologies, et cetera, should enjoy equal&#13;
&#13;
 access to concessional resources, both domestically made&#13;
&#13;
 available or internationally, for poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           Unfortunately, in reality, the poorest often&#13;
&#13;
 happen to be those with the weakest institutional and&#13;
&#13;
 organizational capacity.     So, if we think we must follow,&#13;
&#13;
 on the other hand, the principle of allocating scarce&#13;
&#13;
 resources in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, then&#13;
&#13;
 we may have to adopt results-oriented or performance-&#13;
&#13;
 based approach, and we may then expect better&#13;
&#13;
 achievements in poverty reduction, both at the national&#13;
&#13;
 and international levels.&#13;

&#13;
           Thus, while in some cases national governments&#13;
&#13;
 may feel it is logical to decide to first help those poor&#13;
&#13;
 with a relatively basic implementing capacity rather than&#13;
&#13;
 the poorest or some of them who may not for the moment&#13;
&#13;
 have the minimum capacity, even though on humanitarian&#13;
&#13;
 grounds these should be helped first.           This is indeed a&#13;
&#13;
 very hard choice that one has to make.&#13;
&#13;
           In other words, if we decide that the poorest&#13;
&#13;
 who have no other alternatives should have the priority&#13;
&#13;
 over the limited resources first and then our&#13;
&#13;
 expectations and standards should not be as high as&#13;
&#13;
 idealistically designed.       And we should not aim at best&#13;
&#13;
 practice in most of the cases because they may end up&#13;
&#13;
 being an illusion.     So, these appear to be a tradeoff in&#13;
&#13;
 such a situation.     The cost will have to be borne by&#13;
&#13;
 either the poor or the poorest, and we have to also&#13;
&#13;
 debate on this carefully.&#13;
&#13;
           Now let me turn on empowerment.            We all&#13;
&#13;
 recognize the importance that voices of the poor should&#13;
&#13;
 be better heard and their legitimate concerns should be&#13;
&#13;
 better addressed during the course of poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
 But I just wonder if one should take the same approach in&#13;
&#13;
 addressing the empowerment issue as in the case of the&#13;
&#13;
 other two elements, because promotion of empowerment may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 also simply generate enormous different interest groups&#13;
&#13;
 and decision-making process can be prolonged if different&#13;
&#13;
 interests cannot be reconciled and will not be presented&#13;
&#13;
 in an orderly way and the final report may not&#13;
&#13;
 necessarily be pro-poor.&#13;
&#13;
           And it often happens that many poorest may not&#13;
&#13;
 be interested in fully participating in a process,&#13;
&#13;
 particularly if the process is lengthy and not straight-&#13;
&#13;
 forward in taking care of their immediate interests or,&#13;
&#13;
 equally important, they may not be able to do so.       What&#13;
&#13;
 they care most is just very basic human needs -- food,&#13;
&#13;
 clothes and shelter.    I am not so sure even in this&#13;
&#13;
 country, one of the wealthiest, the poor on the streets&#13;
&#13;
 are interested in participating in the decision-making&#13;
&#13;
 process at the national level, for example, in what is&#13;
&#13;
 going on in Capitol Hill everyday, or any poor people&#13;
&#13;
 have got out of poverty by just trying to be involved&#13;
&#13;
 more proactively in the decision-making process.&#13;
&#13;
           Experience shows that most successful countries&#13;
&#13;
 have concentrated themselves on economic growth before&#13;
&#13;
 the poor could be fully empowered.        In fact, empowerment&#13;
&#13;
 may come very gradually and the development stage makes a&#13;
&#13;
 difference.   Experience in some East Asian countries tell&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 us that strong public institutions and growth-oriented&#13;
&#13;
 policies were the effective way to reduce poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           I just wonder if empowerment, as the paper&#13;
&#13;
 refers to, is based on the past experience or the&#13;
&#13;
 conclusion that comes out is because all the other&#13;
&#13;
 possible alternatives have been simply exhausted.&#13;
&#13;
           I also like to caution that empowerment clearly&#13;
&#13;
 involves politics.    And this is probably not an area that&#13;
&#13;
 the World Bank either should do by its mandate or has the&#13;
&#13;
 capacity to do so in the right way.&#13;
&#13;
           Rather, like Mr. Garcia in his written&#13;
&#13;
 statement, I believe the best road to empowerment may be&#13;
&#13;
 the economic liberalization.      I think a more promising&#13;
&#13;
 aspect in this regard is enhancing empowerment by&#13;
&#13;
 supporting poor people for more and better economic&#13;
&#13;
 opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
           The story of the India woman in Box 1, if I&#13;
&#13;
 remember correctly, that was also cited by Jim Wolfensohn&#13;
&#13;
 in his annual meeting statement, is very telling; poor&#13;
&#13;
 people should have economic independence before they fear&#13;
&#13;
 no one.   As the woman says today "I fear no one; I have&#13;
&#13;
 my own bank account".&#13;
&#13;
           Now let me turn to a related issue on&#13;
&#13;
 development stages.   While I share the view that debate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 about reform is, therefore, not as simply as just between&#13;
&#13;
 gradualism or shock therapy, I do believe that Rome was&#13;
&#13;
 not built in one night.     It is impossible for any poor&#13;
&#13;
 country to be ready with all the institutional&#13;
&#13;
 infrastructure needed to fight against poverty in the&#13;
&#13;
 best possible way in a matter of a few years.          We may&#13;
&#13;
 learn from others; we may learn over the past experience&#13;
&#13;
 and lessons.    So, we may act more wisely and take less&#13;
&#13;
 time in fighting poverty.      But there is no such shortcut&#13;
&#13;
 as a miracle.   And so, we have to be very realistic.&#13;
&#13;
           Therefore, different approaches should be&#13;
&#13;
 applied at a different development stage.           For example,&#13;
&#13;
 some poorest people may not be able to understand the&#13;
&#13;
 emerging information age, simply such as the budget,&#13;
&#13;
 basic socio-economic indicators even if arguably they&#13;
&#13;
 have access to such information.        Countries or local&#13;
&#13;
 communities at such a stage may need very simple but&#13;
&#13;
 practical strategies rather than too sophisticated ones&#13;
&#13;
 which are simply beyond their capacity.&#13;
&#13;
           So, one thing I think that we have to bear in&#13;
&#13;
 mind is how we can be selective.        In this regard, I also&#13;
&#13;
 agree with the U.S. chair in the written statement when&#13;
&#13;
 they cite that the East Asian experience, saying that the&#13;
&#13;
 most remarkable aspect of the Asian experience is that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 they were able to achieve so much progress in poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction without getting everything right.            They sets&#13;
&#13;
 some priorities and got some key things right.             This very&#13;
&#13;
 positive experience should have merited WDR taking a&#13;
&#13;
 country-by-country look.      I think that this is hopefully&#13;
&#13;
 a good exercise.&#13;
&#13;
           And, Mr. Chairman, let me briefly turn to the&#13;
&#13;
 efforts by the international community.             I agree with the&#13;
&#13;
 point that actions at the country level will not be&#13;
&#13;
 enough to fight poverty.      But, unfortunately, we have a&#13;
&#13;
 high pitch on poverty reduction each year while at the&#13;
&#13;
 same time, unfortunately, we see less ODA flowing into&#13;
&#13;
 poor countries and many of them unfortunately are still&#13;
&#13;
 concessional resources dependent for their efforts to&#13;
&#13;
 reduce poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           International financial institutions like the&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank now have less by relative terms concessional&#13;
&#13;
 resources available to help, and we also experienced a&#13;
&#13;
 period which may be characterized as the poor were taxed&#13;
&#13;
 for the poorest.&#13;
&#13;
           It is right to argue that developing countries'&#13;
&#13;
 governments should be primarily responsible and&#13;
&#13;
 accountable to the poor, and make their policies right in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of a pro-poor economic growth strategy.            By the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 same token, industrial countries should also bear the&#13;
&#13;
 responsibility to take at least some policy changes that&#13;
&#13;
 will help developing countries either benefit from market&#13;
&#13;
 access or more concessional resources from bilateral&#13;
&#13;
 donors.   Otherwise, the high pitch may sound increasingly&#13;
&#13;
 very empty.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me turn very briefly on China's experience&#13;
&#13;
 in poverty reduction.    We think that institutional&#13;
&#13;
 capacity really matters and accountability of the&#13;
&#13;
 government at all levels; particularly at the grassroots&#13;
&#13;
 level would be very important and the support from the&#13;
&#13;
 majority and other important elements as well for the&#13;
&#13;
 success of any strategy for poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, now let me turn to some specific&#13;
&#13;
 comments, first on public indicators.         Like some others,&#13;
&#13;
 particularly my Pakistani and Brazilian colleagues, I&#13;
&#13;
 don't think it is appropriate to have political&#13;
&#13;
 indicators in Chapter 6 in a Bank's publication, even&#13;
&#13;
 though by doing a better research these things should be&#13;
&#13;
 researched, but doing so in a public manner, the Bank may&#13;
&#13;
 be interpreted to endorse those indicators, even though&#13;
&#13;
 they are very subjective.&#13;
&#13;
           For example, in paragraph 6.94, that gives&#13;
&#13;
 essential features of a democratic system of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 government.   I simply do not understand what it is trying&#13;
&#13;
 to tell us.   I am not so sure if the paragraph tries to&#13;
&#13;
 indicate the poor member countries are not democratic,&#13;
&#13;
 that democracy should be measured by poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 performance or not.   I strongly request that these&#13;
&#13;
 indicators be deleted.&#13;
&#13;
            Let me also turn to the management of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
 It is very interesting and enlightening to note the idea&#13;
&#13;
 of measuring poverty by using two sets of indicators --&#13;
&#13;
 income and non-income ones.      But how could we quantify&#13;
&#13;
 non-income ones on decentralization?         I understand the&#13;
&#13;
 usefulness and importance of decentralization in this&#13;
&#13;
 regard of poverty reduction.      But this chair, among&#13;
&#13;
 others, has expressed our concern over decentralization&#13;
&#13;
 many times because we believe we need a balanced view.&#13;
&#13;
            In case, if local capacity is weak, especially&#13;
&#13;
 when fiscal or budgetary discipline is lacking,&#13;
&#13;
 decentralization may not do always good effects as we&#13;
&#13;
 expect.&#13;
&#13;
            And then, I think I would like to ask a&#13;
&#13;
 question on population increase and its relationship with&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.   The report does not examine the impact of&#13;
&#13;
 population growth on poverty reduction.            If 6 billion&#13;
&#13;
 will earn less than two dollars per day, what will be the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 implication in terms of the carrying capacity based on&#13;
&#13;
 available world resources?     I think in the process of&#13;
&#13;
 human capital investment, the poor people should also be&#13;
&#13;
 made to understand that their interests in economic&#13;
&#13;
 terms, if not social ones, also lie in their&#13;
&#13;
 understanding.   Less children would be better so that&#13;
&#13;
 they could educate and feed them in a better way.&#13;
&#13;
           On enhancing institutional capacity building,&#13;
&#13;
 institutional capacity matters a lot during the course of&#13;
&#13;
 economic development, including the process of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction, but remains unresolved about how the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 should help member countries in this regard and do it&#13;
&#13;
 effectively.&#13;
&#13;
           We also need to address the issue of&#13;
&#13;
 decentralization with a more balanced view, as I just&#13;
&#13;
 pointed out momentarily.     Without necessary capacity and&#13;
&#13;
 discipline in place at different levels, decentralization&#13;
&#13;
 may do probably more harm than good.         The poor will not&#13;
&#13;
 benefit from the disorganized decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
           And, as I said, I want to caution on&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, not that I don't understand the importance&#13;
&#13;
 of seeing it in the poverty reduction dimension.         I can&#13;
&#13;
 go along with the concept of empowerment if it means an&#13;
&#13;
 active commitment by individual policymakers and&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 protectionists to listen to the poor and earn their&#13;
&#13;
 trust.     That will help formulate poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategies.    But I would like to caution, as is defined&#13;
&#13;
 in the report, empowerment may involve political&#13;
&#13;
 dimensions.&#13;
&#13;
             The Bank should be extremely careful&#13;
&#13;
 operationally in dealing with it, particularly in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of so-called social institutions and social barriers.&#13;
&#13;
 Otherwise, the Bank's involvement in this area could be&#13;
&#13;
 easily counterproductive.&#13;
&#13;
             The Bank should encourage dialogues between the&#13;
&#13;
 poorest and policymakers rather than encouraging&#13;
&#13;
 proliferation of interest groups or NGOs.            Experience may&#13;
&#13;
 show that most NGOs are not composed by the poorest; many&#13;
&#13;
 have their own agendas, which may not necessarily serve&#13;
&#13;
 exclusively the interest of poor people.             NGOs have&#13;
&#13;
 developed very rapidly over the past ten years and the&#13;
&#13;
 contribution of NGOs to economic development remains to&#13;
&#13;
 be seen.&#13;
&#13;
             It seems that a lot of NGOs are more&#13;
&#13;
 enthusiastic about going on to the streets and protesting&#13;
&#13;
 against globalization rather than going to the&#13;
&#13;
 development fields to be of real help.           In addition, we&#13;
&#13;
 face a lot of confusion and uncertainties about clear&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 code of conduct, rules of the game concerning non-&#13;
&#13;
 governmental organizations' participation in the&#13;
&#13;
 development business.     I think that unless we address&#13;
&#13;
 them adequately in general terms, we just welcome NGOs in&#13;
&#13;
 a process of poverty reduction is simply not enough.&#13;
&#13;
            And last but not least, I would like to ask two&#13;
&#13;
 questions concerning the Bank's experience since the last&#13;
&#13;
 WDR on poverty reduction in the 1990s.         First, how many&#13;
&#13;
 countries have effectively adopted approaches as&#13;
&#13;
 suggested in the report a decade ago and how well these&#13;
&#13;
 approaches have worked, particularly in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 country's experience in generating labor-extensive growth&#13;
&#13;
 pattern?&#13;
&#13;
            Secondly, participatory system and social&#13;
&#13;
 institutions seems to be the main lessons we have learned&#13;
&#13;
 over the past ten years in terms of poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 experience.   But what else we have also learned from the&#13;
&#13;
 past?   Probably that should also be answered.&#13;

&#13;
 the whole WDR team for this remarkable achievement in&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensiveness and synthesis.&#13;
&#13;
             I really believe, as previous speakers have&#13;
&#13;
 already referred to, that they have achieved indeed a&#13;
&#13;
 remarkable balancing act between the old and the new,&#13;
&#13;
 between the three pillar strategy which is proposed here&#13;
&#13;
 and reconfirmation of the centrality of sound growth&#13;
&#13;
 policies.&#13;
&#13;
             I won't in the interest of time elaborate on&#13;
&#13;
 these general aspects apart from perhaps referring to a&#13;
&#13;
 question raised by Terrie O'Leary in her statement which&#13;
&#13;
 is in my view far from a rhetoric one when she asks&#13;
&#13;
 whether, given the limited capacities in many of the&#13;
&#13;
 developing countries, are we putting too much emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensiveness.    I believe that in the operational&#13;
&#13;
 implications of this strategy, this is really a question&#13;
&#13;
 which we shall need to keep very closely in our minds.&#13;
&#13;
             It is indeed clear -- and this was also&#13;
&#13;
 confirmed during the introductory remarks this morning by&#13;
&#13;
 management -- that since this strategy at the level in&#13;
&#13;
 which it has been drafted does not really prioritize,&#13;
&#13;
 that the implication of it is that an enormous burden on&#13;
&#13;
 prioritization will fall at the country level.      And I&#13;
&#13;
 accept this notion that this is where prioritization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 shall need to be achieved, but I believe this also means&#13;
&#13;
 that we will need to put in place the tools to assist our&#13;
&#13;
 member countries in achieving that prioritization.     And&#13;
&#13;
 this leads me to expect that we may need to have quite a&#13;
&#13;
 complete and comprehensive look at the way poverty&#13;
&#13;
 assessments are done, for instance.&#13;
&#13;
           I think this tool should really as a result of&#13;
&#13;
 this report be completely revisited and should have a&#13;
&#13;
 much higher ranking in the range of our analytical&#13;
&#13;
 instruments.    And it is also clear, of course, that once&#13;
&#13;
 these poverty assessments are accomplished, that the way&#13;
&#13;
 they are going to be fed into the poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy papers will be of the utmost importance.&#13;
&#13;
           But I look forward to further elaboration on&#13;
&#13;
 that, and would hope that in the consultation which is&#13;
&#13;
 going to take place, as I note from Mike Walton's&#13;
&#13;
 remarks, that we will also give sufficient voice to what&#13;
&#13;
 I would say the newly-elected minister in a poor African&#13;
&#13;
 state with limited capacity who has to make up his mind&#13;
&#13;
 on what he will achieve during the next four years,&#13;
&#13;
 because that is really what it all amounts to in the&#13;
&#13;
 large extent.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me turn to a number of specific remarks,&#13;
&#13;
 especially on issues where I feel that perhaps with some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 minor redrafting, especially when it comes to&#13;
&#13;
 transmitting some of the messages from the chapters into&#13;
&#13;
 the overview, the final product could be further improved&#13;
&#13;
 within the next coming days.&#13;
&#13;
           First, on the opportunity pillar, and the&#13;
&#13;
 notion of pro-poor growth.     Let me say that in my view --&#13;
&#13;
 and some colleagues had problems with that -- but, in my&#13;
&#13;
 view, it remains clear from reading the chapters on this&#13;
&#13;
 pillar that the centrality of growth is appropriately&#13;
&#13;
 reconfirmed and that it really comes out quite clearly&#13;
&#13;
 from the evidence in the report that sound reforms and&#13;
&#13;
 liberalization policies are more likely to be pro-poor&#13;
&#13;
 than anti-poor.   And I think this is an important notion&#13;
&#13;
 to be kept in mind.&#13;
&#13;
           But at the same time, the report -- and this&#13;
&#13;
 contains equally relevant evidence -- in favor of&#13;
&#13;
 policies aimed at enhancing the impact on poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction, on growth.    And I think this section refers to&#13;
&#13;
 what Nora Lustig in her slide presentation presented&#13;
&#13;
 under the topic of making markets work better for the&#13;
&#13;
 poor.   I think she mentioned -- and it is mentioned in&#13;
&#13;
 the report -- this is a fairly new domain of activity.&#13;
&#13;
 It is also, as the report notes, a domain in which&#13;
&#13;
 incentives for policymakers to undertake reforms are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 often quite small.     And it is a domain where in my view&#13;
&#13;
 in light of the micro level knowledge of local markets&#13;
&#13;
 and sub-markets that it implies, it is an area for which&#13;
&#13;
 all relevant country knowledge is not readily available.&#13;
&#13;
           So, just to make the point that I think it is&#13;
&#13;
 an important dimension of a pro-poor growth policy but it&#13;
&#13;
 is also an aspect that I mentioned on which much work&#13;
&#13;
 will need to be achieved in the context of the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 process, I believe.&#13;
&#13;
           Still on the pro-poor focus of opportunity,&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps a few comments on the sections which are written&#13;
&#13;
 on the pace of liberalization and market reforms more&#13;
&#13;
 generally.     There I believe that one of the most&#13;
&#13;
 important trends in recent, in very recent years is that&#13;
&#13;
 development economics have come to take the point and&#13;
&#13;
 take the view that privatization, deregulation,&#13;
&#13;
 liberalization need to be appropriately designed and&#13;
&#13;
 sequenced in order to minimize losses and maximize&#13;
&#13;
 benefits for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
           I believe it is very important to recognize&#13;
&#13;
 this notion.     We very much welcome it.        But, at the same&#13;
&#13;
 time, I think it is also our duty to caution against any&#13;
&#13;
 over-simplification in that field.          I believe we have to&#13;
&#13;
 continue to convey the notion that time by itself is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 unlikely to solve these kind of problems with&#13;
&#13;
 liberalization.   It needs to be justified by well-&#13;
&#13;
 designed and transparent road maps on how reforms will be&#13;
&#13;
 sequenced, on how in the process compensatory measures to&#13;
&#13;
 reduce or eliminate the impact on the losers will be&#13;
&#13;
 taken care of.&#13;
&#13;
            I know that from Lewis Holden's written&#13;
&#13;
 statement that he has made that the central point of his&#13;
&#13;
 intervention and I believe we have to keep that dimension&#13;
&#13;
 onboard.&#13;
&#13;
            For instance, with respect to the number of&#13;
&#13;
 arguments that are made in favor of gradualistic&#13;
&#13;
 approaches to liberalization, more specifically trade&#13;
&#13;
 liberalization, and since this report also deals and has&#13;
&#13;
 to do with perceptions that we may create, let me just&#13;
&#13;
 say that valuable as they may be, the need for job&#13;
&#13;
 protection or country-specific factors in justifying a&#13;
&#13;
 gradualistic approach to liberalization, that these are&#13;
&#13;
 also precisely the kind of arguments that industrial&#13;
&#13;
 countries are using in order to justify their&#13;
&#13;
 gradualistic approach to the elimination of trade&#13;
&#13;
 barriers to low-income countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           So, we think just to say that we have to be&#13;
&#13;
 cautious on the general notions that we would convey&#13;
&#13;
 there.&#13;
&#13;
           Another point is that I think we also have to&#13;
&#13;
 be aware that while we are now advocating more&#13;
&#13;
 gradualistic, sequential approaches to liberalization,&#13;
&#13;
 that in a number of respects this may also be an attempt&#13;
&#13;
 to rewrite history.    In a sense, in quite a number of&#13;
&#13;
 sectors and in quite a number of parts of the world,&#13;
&#13;
 countries have already gone very far with liberalization.&#13;
&#13;
 And the problem there now is not to recommend them&#13;
&#13;
 gradual liberalization because it has taken place.     The&#13;
&#13;
 problem there is to assist them in, I would say, cleaning&#13;
&#13;
 up the mess of poorly-designed liberalization policies of&#13;
&#13;
 the past and in doing so trying to make sure that the&#13;
&#13;
 process which has come through is not reverted and&#13;
&#13;
 reversed in an undesirable way.&#13;
&#13;
           On empowerment, Mr. Chairman, it is, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 not a surprise that this chapter is a source of some&#13;
&#13;
 controversy.    But let me say that I think Zhu Xian made a&#13;
&#13;
 number of important points, especially related to the&#13;
&#13;
 role of NGOs.   I am all in favor of giving strong voice&#13;
&#13;
 to NGOs in the development agenda, but I believe it&#13;
&#13;
 raises issues of accountability of which we as an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 institution such as the World Bank have to be aware of&#13;
&#13;
 and on which we also need to add the proper dimensions in&#13;
&#13;
 such a report.&#13;
&#13;
            But, on the whole, I would say that I found&#13;
&#13;
 that this chapter has been written in a very sensible&#13;
&#13;
 way.    I believe that the message conveyed is sufficiently&#13;
&#13;
 clear but at the same time sufficiently, I would say,&#13;
&#13;
 non-intrusive to respect the notion that especially in&#13;
&#13;
 this area governments will have to be in the driver's&#13;
&#13;
 seat.&#13;
&#13;
            On this empowerment, let me just make one&#13;
&#13;
 specific comment on the issue of decentralization.           While&#13;
&#13;
 I share in principle Matthias Meyer's enthusiasm about&#13;
&#13;
 Swiss-type decentralization policies, I think we need to&#13;
&#13;
 remain aware that not all of our countries are yet in a&#13;
&#13;
 position to implement such policies with, I would say,&#13;
&#13;
 the perfection of a Swiss watch.        And this brings me&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps to one specific suggestion for having another&#13;
&#13;
 look at the draft.&#13;
&#13;
            Personally, I would appreciate if some of the&#13;
&#13;
 recommendations of Chapter 6, which I have found fairly&#13;
&#13;
 balanced on the need to support decentralization with&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive and transparent rules of the game and&#13;
&#13;
 understanding, organizing the relationship between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 subnational and central governments, at least something&#13;
&#13;
 of this could be captured in the overview chapter, I&#13;
&#13;
 believe, with one sentence, this could improve this&#13;
&#13;
 section in the overview chapter.&#13;
&#13;
            On the security pillar, a few comments in the&#13;
&#13;
 same spirit.    On the protection of the poor during times&#13;
&#13;
 of economic and financial crisis, there also I found some&#13;
&#13;
 minor disconnects between the chapter dealing with this&#13;
&#13;
 issue and the message that may emerge from the overview&#13;
&#13;
 chapter.&#13;
&#13;
            I have found, for instance, that the overview&#13;
&#13;
 could include perhaps a more explicit reference to the&#13;
&#13;
 need for putting safety nets in place before crises hit.&#13;
&#13;
 I think that was a very interesting section in the&#13;
&#13;
 chapter and I don't think I found something of that in&#13;
&#13;
 the overview.   I think that is a very important aspect of&#13;
&#13;
 this chapter.&#13;
&#13;
            But more generally, I wonder whether it would&#13;
&#13;
 not be worthwhile to be somewhat more explicit -- the&#13;
&#13;
 notion is there but just in one or two words -- but&#13;
&#13;
 somewhat more explicit on the needs for countries to&#13;
&#13;
 embark and to continue to be committed to comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
 crisis prevention measures as an aspect of a poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy.    I remember when three years ago we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 were confronted in this Board with the Asian crisis, we&#13;
&#13;
 suddenly became aware that issues such as financial&#13;
&#13;
 sector reform, corporate governance, judicial reform,&#13;
&#13;
 bankruptcy, that all that had potentially -- not only&#13;
&#13;
 potentially but in reality -- enormous impact on the&#13;
&#13;
 poor.   And I believe this report would be a good&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity to remind us of that lesson and to keep it on&#13;
&#13;
 the list of priorities we should look at.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, on global actions, I strongly welcome&#13;
&#13;
 the inclusion of this chapter in the report, fully&#13;
&#13;
 support the messages in the sections on opportunity and&#13;
&#13;
 security.    But I must admit that I have some problems&#13;
&#13;
 with one or two paragraphs in the empowerment section on&#13;
&#13;
 giving voice to poor people in global fora.&#13;
&#13;
             Personally, I am a strong believer in CG type&#13;
&#13;
 models.   I have very high expectations about information&#13;
&#13;
 technology as a medium for forging coalitions of the&#13;
&#13;
 poor.   But there, despite the prominence which this has&#13;
&#13;
 recently achieved in our agenda, once again I didn't find&#13;
&#13;
 I think a reference certainly not in this section in the&#13;
&#13;
 overview chapter on the potential importance of&#13;
&#13;
 information technology, Development Gateway and so on.&#13;
&#13;
 So there, perhaps there could be some scope for&#13;
&#13;
 correction.&#13;

                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           But a number of other issues dealt in this&#13;
&#13;
 section such as accountability and transparency of&#13;
&#13;
 international financial institutions, application of&#13;
&#13;
 subsidiarity principle and decision-making in the&#13;
&#13;
 international financial architecture are in my view dealt&#13;
&#13;
 with -- in light of the importance which they have -- in&#13;
&#13;
 a perhaps rather superficial way, I must admit.        I&#13;
&#13;
 personally think that these are issues which would&#13;
&#13;
 deserve a more informed debate.&#13;
&#13;
           The poverty lens for looking at them is&#13;
&#13;
 important but I don't think it is the only lens through&#13;
&#13;
 which we should look at these issues.         I think the issues&#13;
&#13;
 are much broader; for instance, on accountability and&#13;
&#13;
 transparency, it is clear just to give one notion that it&#13;
&#13;
 is equally important for the way public opinion from&#13;
&#13;
 industrial countries looks at the institution and have&#13;
&#13;
 expectations about the way international financial&#13;
&#13;
 institutions run their business.       Subsidiarity principle&#13;
&#13;
 has implications for division of work between an&#13;
&#13;
 institution such as the World Bank and regional&#13;
&#13;
 development banks.   The issue is not dealt with but it&#13;
&#13;
 could have potential important implications.&#13;
&#13;
           On international financial architecture,&#13;
&#13;
 reference is made to G-7, some exploration of ways to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 associate the poor through different channels through G-7&#13;
&#13;
 deliberations.    But, for instance, when it comes to the&#13;
&#13;
 role of the institution, my sense was that the&#13;
&#13;
 institution itself such as the World Bank is very much&#13;
&#13;
 dealt with as a kind of monolithic entity and not as a&#13;
&#13;
 multilateral intergovernmental forum where precisely&#13;
&#13;
 decision-making is taking place and where everyone,&#13;
&#13;
 including the poor, have a seat around the table.         And&#13;
&#13;
 that is a dimension which is completely dismissed in this&#13;
&#13;
 section.&#13;
&#13;
             Just to say that on these aspects, I am not&#13;
&#13;
 even sure that by diluting them and referring them to&#13;
&#13;
 another debate, the report would lose much of its value&#13;
&#13;
 and relevance.&#13;
&#13;
             I will keep it with these remarks, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman.    Let me once again congratulate the staff for&#13;
&#13;
 this remarkable piece of work.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much, Luc.&#13;

             With the next speaker, Paulo, we will be about&#13;
&#13;
 halfway through my list.       So, I suggest after Paulo, we&#13;
&#13;
 turn to the team.     There are a number of specific&#13;
&#13;
 questions, some clarifications needed, certain themes&#13;
&#13;
 beginning to emerge, and you can pick up on them.&#13;

&#13;
           But, first, Paulo, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. GOMES:   Thank you, Sven.        I am going to be&#13;
&#13;
 short to make things easy for everybody.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, I think this report delivers a&#13;
&#13;
 strong message and I believe that it should be useful to&#13;
&#13;
 a broad range of policymakers for many years to come.&#13;
&#13;
 The debate that took place around this report shows that&#13;
&#13;
 the WDR is the single most important symbol of the&#13;
&#13;
 direction of the Bank thinking.&#13;
&#13;
           This year, the report forces us to reflect upon&#13;
&#13;
 complexity and the multi-dimensional aspect of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
 I think it confirmed that we need to go beyond narrow&#13;
&#13;
 economic analysis of markets, particularly in Africa,&#13;
&#13;
 where there is imperfect information for the market to&#13;
&#13;
 perform their economic functions efficiently.         So, I&#13;
&#13;
 think in that case social arrangements are needed as a&#13;
&#13;
 complement.&#13;
&#13;
           We also welcome the holistic approach to the&#13;
&#13;
 development defended by the authors of report, and my&#13;
&#13;
 authorities will certainly use some of the issues raised&#13;
&#13;
 in the report and they will do their best to try to&#13;
&#13;
 articulate them with their own agenda, because I think&#13;
&#13;
 the issue of the agenda here is extremely important.          I&#13;
&#13;
 believe that if our countries don't manage to have their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 own agendas, I think they will always be pushed forward&#13;
&#13;
 by good thinking, new thinking, innovation, but, as I&#13;
&#13;
 said last week, our countries will need to give them room&#13;
&#13;
 for maneuver to think on their own and to design their&#13;
&#13;
 own agenda.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, I think this report comes also in&#13;
&#13;
 a very important moment for Africa.        More governments are&#13;
&#13;
 democratically led than at any other previous time in&#13;
&#13;
 Africa.   Macroeconomic, monetary and fiscal management&#13;
&#13;
 are improving across the entire continent.         In that&#13;
&#13;
 sense, I would have wanted to see a more clear&#13;
&#13;
 recognition that in Africa a sustainable transition in&#13;
&#13;
 economic, social but, most importantly, human terms&#13;
&#13;
 demand careful consideration of pacing and sequencing of&#13;
&#13;
 the reform.   I think the words "pacing and sequencing"&#13;
&#13;
 are extremely important.&#13;
&#13;
           If we don't pay attention to that, we might run&#13;
&#13;
 the risk of destroying all achievements we have obtained&#13;
&#13;
 so far.   I think if we push too much the countries -- and&#13;
&#13;
 I think Luis Balduino has raised that -- we may create an&#13;
&#13;
 environment of reform fatigue that could sometimes&#13;
&#13;
 trigger national crisis.     Some people will say that you&#13;
&#13;
 need national crisis some time to go forward, but we have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 all seen how it has been extremely expensive to remediate&#13;
&#13;
 all the crises that we have witnessed lately in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
            I think with this report we all agree that we&#13;
&#13;
 are progressively approaching the needed consensus about&#13;
&#13;
 what to do in fighting poverty, but, at the same time, we&#13;
&#13;
 are still struggling to learn how to do things.           And this&#13;
&#13;
 is probably where we will face the major challenge.&#13;
&#13;
            It is precisely because of this difficulty of&#13;
&#13;
 what to do or how to do things that the Bank in the&#13;
&#13;
 future should try in the WDR to couple these analyses&#13;
&#13;
 with a world map which indicates how we could internalize&#13;
&#13;
 those strong messages that we have in this document into&#13;
&#13;
 the institution, and the way we function.&#13;
&#13;
            In fact, I think the WDR has many lessons for&#13;
&#13;
 our own internal functionality and consequently in the&#13;
&#13;
 issue of the culture of the Bank staff.            In that sense, I&#13;
&#13;
 would like to also maybe underscore the need to have a&#13;
&#13;
 more proactive DEC in the operations.         I think it is the&#13;
&#13;
 only way to make sure that we will translate those kinds&#13;
&#13;
 of messages in a particular way when advising our&#13;
&#13;
 clients.&#13;
&#13;
            I would like also to welcome the emphasis given&#13;
&#13;
 to the participatory approach, but the notion of&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment introduced in this report is a very complex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 political equation.     Even myself, I have been trying&#13;
&#13;
 sometimes to engage in issues that could be considered&#13;
&#13;
 political, but I think it is an area where the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
 certainly not really prepared and not prepared to&#13;
&#13;
 deliver.     So, that is why it is so dangerous to try to go&#13;
&#13;
 slowly to this area that will force maybe the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
 look more deeply in how to support countries.          What could&#13;
&#13;
 happen if a country, a government comes to the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
 says, "you know, I have a political problem; would you&#13;
&#13;
 assist me in solving those political problems that I&#13;
&#13;
 have".     And I think there we will face a problem.&#13;
&#13;
             So, I think I would recommend that we move very&#13;
&#13;
 carefully in this area.      And if we have to move, I think&#13;
&#13;
 the precondition is to change our mandate.           I think our&#13;
&#13;
 mandate is clear in that sense on the political aspect.&#13;
&#13;
 And if we decide to go forward in that sense, I think&#13;
&#13;
 that involving the EDs will be extremely important.          I&#13;
&#13;
 think we are the ones who have to go back to the capitals&#13;
&#13;
 some time when we receive critics and protests for our&#13;
&#13;
 government about the increasing involvement of the World&#13;
&#13;
 Bank on political issues.&#13;
&#13;
             But, Mr. Chairman, I think that this document,&#13;
&#13;
 this report will be even more useful in the case of&#13;
&#13;
 Africa if we look at how many of our countries think that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the issue of poverty reduction should be addressed.           And&#13;
&#13;
 the main point that has come up from the discussion is&#13;
&#13;
 the issue of regional integration.         Our economies are too&#13;
&#13;
 small.    Our states are too weak, and we have enormous&#13;
&#13;
 institutional problems.&#13;
&#13;
            And that is why I think many young leaders in&#13;
&#13;
 Africa try not to push toward the issue of regional&#13;
&#13;
 integration, which happened to be also a process like a&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP.    I think many of our colleagues have raised the&#13;
&#13;
 issue of the PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
            And I would like just to give a precision that&#13;
&#13;
 most of the countries in Africa, West Africa and Central&#13;
&#13;
 Africa, have adopted the PRSP as a process.           But to be&#13;
&#13;
 frank here, there is no high level of passion when they&#13;
&#13;
 get themselves involved in this process.            I don't want to&#13;
&#13;
 say that they don't believe in the process of the PRSP,&#13;
&#13;
 but there is no passion.      And we know that in development&#13;
&#13;
 you need to have passion to move things forward.            And we&#13;
&#13;
 don't find this passion.&#13;
&#13;
            But in regional integration, in any country&#13;
&#13;
 that you go in, in the West, Central and South Africa,&#13;
&#13;
 you will find that passion.       So, why don't we take the&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity as we find in the document to bring this&#13;
&#13;
 issue of regional integration at the center of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 discussion, and you will see the difference that it will&#13;
&#13;
 make.&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Chairman, the major constraint to&#13;
&#13;
 sustainable development, as I said, in Africa is the&#13;
&#13;
 capacity limitation in critical areas such as markets,&#13;
&#13;
 productive factor, administrative and institutional&#13;
&#13;
 structure in the public and private sector.         Therefore, I&#13;
&#13;
 think that I could try to associate two elements in your&#13;
&#13;
 pillars.    One would be enhancing governance to strengthen&#13;
&#13;
 administration and reducing administrative costs.        This&#13;
&#13;
 is one element that if you put into the regional&#13;
&#13;
 integration framework will be extremely useful.&#13;
&#13;
             And secondly, creating a critical mass in range&#13;
&#13;
 of areas.    I think that a strong need for cooperation to&#13;
&#13;
 strengthen administration and reduce costs through joint&#13;
&#13;
 and shared operations in areas such as customs&#13;
&#13;
 administration, in banking regulation could also help&#13;
&#13;
 reduce poverty.    It is not visible as it would be in&#13;
&#13;
 education or other areas, but the impact that it will&#13;
&#13;
 have in employment will be tremendous.&#13;
&#13;
             On creating critical mass in a range of areas,&#13;
&#13;
 I think that the need for creating this critical mass in&#13;
&#13;
 areas like provision of tertiary education, capital&#13;
&#13;
 markets, public and private retirement systems, security&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 and legal systems could be very useful and also providing&#13;
&#13;
 services and programs to fight, for example, issues like&#13;
&#13;
 HIV/AIDS.&#13;
&#13;
             In this process of creating the critical mass,&#13;
&#13;
 I think women should be at the center.          You know, in&#13;
&#13;
 Africa now people recognize that if you increase the&#13;
&#13;
 revenue of women, you will see immediately the impact on&#13;
&#13;
 consumption for education and health.          If we increase the&#13;
&#13;
 revenue of men, well we all know where the money goes.&#13;
&#13;
 And I don't say I don't do that; I react like that but I&#13;
&#13;
 am part of the problem too.&#13;
&#13;
             And the solution will be really to increase the&#13;
&#13;
 revenues for women, and I would really encourage you to&#13;
&#13;
 have that at the center.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, Mr. Chairman, Chapter 10, I think we&#13;
&#13;
 support entirely the view expressed in this chapter, and&#13;
&#13;
 we look forward for a more deeper discussion during the&#13;
&#13;
 annual meeting.&#13;
&#13;
             On Chapter 11, Reforming Development Assistance&#13;
&#13;
 to Fight Poverty, well, I am skeptical, very skeptical.&#13;
&#13;
 We had a discussion yesterday in the CODE Subcommittee.&#13;
&#13;
 And although the CDF would be very useful in this&#13;
&#13;
 coordination of the donors, I don't think that we have&#13;
&#13;
 managed really to convince the donors to have a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 coordinated action toward fighting poverty, in assisting&#13;
&#13;
 countries that are committed to fight poverty.       There is&#13;
&#13;
 still bilateral interest that really is disturbing the&#13;
&#13;
 system.&#13;
&#13;
            So, I think that beyond the CDF approach, a&#13;
&#13;
 code of conduct may be required with regard to the issue&#13;
&#13;
 of donor coordination.      And we have to say that very&#13;
&#13;
 clearly.&#13;
&#13;
            And finally, on the issue of debt, I would have&#13;
&#13;
 wanted to see it earlier in the report and not at the end&#13;
&#13;
 of the report, let me say that we continue to support the&#13;
&#13;
 link between debt and poverty, but we should not forget&#13;
&#13;
 that at the same time as the debt relief is implemented,&#13;
&#13;
 industrialized countries must reverse their long-term&#13;
&#13;
 decline in aid flows and start to increase their&#13;
&#13;
 development assistance.      Otherwise, the value of the debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief stands to be nullified by diminished aid.&#13;
&#13;
            Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the team.&#13;
&#13;
 I think they had a very, very difficult job to do and, as&#13;
&#13;
 I said again, this document will be useful if our&#13;
&#13;
 countries could articulate some of the main ideas to&#13;
&#13;
 their own agenda.     We need our own agenda, and we need to&#13;
&#13;
 give them room to digest their own agenda before bringing&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 more and more recommendations that sometimes end up being&#13;
&#13;
 conditionalities.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much; very good&#13;
&#13;
 comments.&#13;
&#13;
             Let's turn back to the team, and we will do it&#13;
&#13;
 in the same order as we started.         And I think that will&#13;
&#13;
 then bring us to lunch.&#13;
&#13;
             Nick, please.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. STERN:   I will try to be brief in the&#13;
&#13;
 interest of your own hunger and ours.&#13;
&#13;
             Let me start by saying something about&#13;
&#13;
 hierarchies and emphases.       We have tried to offer a&#13;
&#13;
 multi-dimensional approach both to the concept of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 itself and to the measures for overcoming it.        And we&#13;
&#13;
 think that those things are important as a group.&#13;
&#13;
             Now there are strong complementarities between&#13;
&#13;
 those elements; for example, investment in health and&#13;
&#13;
 education have strong development outcomes in their own&#13;
&#13;
 rights.   They help directly on poverty, but at the same&#13;
&#13;
 time they lay the basis for future growth.&#13;
&#13;
             We have just heard the same is true in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 as far as possible channeling incomes to women.        That can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 have an immediate effect on poverty and also be a strong&#13;
&#13;
 investment in future growth.&#13;
&#13;
           So, a lot of things that we talk about affect&#13;
&#13;
 directly the elements of poverty that are under&#13;
&#13;
 discussion and have a future payoff.         So, it is for this&#13;
&#13;
 reason that one has to be cautious about saying, well,&#13;
&#13;
 there are three things here, but actually the full&#13;
&#13;
 priority should be on the first one.         So, it is because&#13;
&#13;
 of the interactions that we are cautious.&#13;
&#13;
           It is also that we are cautious about laying&#13;
&#13;
 priorities because the actual choices that are involved,&#13;
&#13;
 which will be there, how much you do allocate to&#13;
&#13;
 education, how much you do allocate to social protection,&#13;
&#13;
 how much you do allocate to improving administrations,&#13;
&#13;
 those are all kinds of choices which governments have to&#13;
&#13;
 make in their expenditures will be, as many people out,&#13;
&#13;
 taken differently by different countries.          And that is as&#13;
&#13;
 it should be.&#13;
&#13;
           So, the second reason for being cautious about&#13;
&#13;
 hierarchy is because some of the key decisions which can&#13;
&#13;
 be different and will involve different weights, if you&#13;
&#13;
 like, on growth and poverty reduction have to be taken at&#13;
&#13;
 the local level, the level of the country.&#13;

&#13;
           But we did want to have to come through&#13;
&#13;
 strongly here -- and this is the last thing I want to say&#13;
&#13;
 on this -- the importance of growth in the whole story so&#13;
&#13;
 that an overemphasis on choices between growth and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction are actually distorting the argument.&#13;
&#13;
 The question is how you integrate these various different&#13;
&#13;
 elements in a country strategy -- health, education,&#13;
&#13;
 participation and the environment for growth.&#13;
&#13;
           I personally attach high weight to the&#13;
&#13;
 improvement of the business environment in generating&#13;
&#13;
 growth, that what you are looking for is reforms in&#13;
&#13;
 government and administration and the legal system which&#13;
&#13;
 enable people to do business and, in particular, enable&#13;
&#13;
 small firms to do business.      That I think is a key part&#13;
&#13;
 of the story.   And if you get that right, you both&#13;
&#13;
 involve the poor and you generate growth.          So, I think we&#13;
&#13;
 have to think of reforms in terms of improving the&#13;
&#13;
 investment climate.&#13;
&#13;
           The second point I wanted to turn to was the&#13;
&#13;
 pacing and sequencing of the reforms, as was expressed in&#13;
&#13;
 the last intervention, and I think that is a very helpful&#13;
&#13;
 way of articulating the issues.       At the same time, you&#13;
&#13;
 have got to be reasonably confident; we should not be too&#13;
&#13;
 hesitant about where you want to go.         I think we do know&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 that trade liberalization is good for growth.            I think we&#13;
&#13;
 do know that a positive environment for private business&#13;
&#13;
 is good for growth and, in general, both those things are&#13;
&#13;
 at least neutral, possibly better for the distribution of&#13;
&#13;
 income.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think we have to have some confidence&#13;
&#13;
 where we are going, but also have some careful&#13;
&#13;
 understanding of the pacing and sequencing issues.             We do&#13;
&#13;
 I think know quite a lot; I am not saying there is a lot&#13;
&#13;
 we don't know.     But we do know quite a lot; there are&#13;
&#13;
 some things that should be done quickly.             I think macro&#13;
&#13;
 stability is one thing which you have to get on with.            A&#13;
&#13;
 gradualistic approach to macro stability I don't think&#13;
&#13;
 gets you very far.&#13;
&#13;
           I think opening to trade is an area where you&#13;
&#13;
 can move pretty quickly.       There are other issues, like&#13;
&#13;
 institution building, reform of administration, pension&#13;
&#13;
 reform, treatments of capital accounts, financial sector&#13;
&#13;
 reform which in the nature of the exercise are going to&#13;
&#13;
 take longer.     If they are going to take longer like&#13;
&#13;
 planting oak trees, you have to get on it and plant it&#13;
&#13;
 now.   But we have to recognize that they do take longer&#13;
&#13;
 and we have to, therefore, be cautious about some things&#13;
&#13;
 which depend very much on the building of institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           So, we do understand I think something of those&#13;
&#13;
 relationships, but they are complicated.             It is difficult&#13;
&#13;
 to sort of articulate them in simple forms.            But I think&#13;
&#13;
 the reform does try to point to the issues in a&#13;
&#13;
 constructive way.     And it does try to avoid the idea that&#13;
&#13;
 until you get everything do nothing, which is a recipe&#13;
&#13;
 for inaction, and that is not a position that the report&#13;
&#13;
 takes.&#13;
&#13;
           For example, you cannot say that we won't do&#13;
&#13;
 any reform until everybody is protected and all the&#13;
&#13;
 losers are compensated.      That is just going to stop you&#13;
&#13;
 doing anything at all.&#13;
&#13;
           So, we try to get in what we say a balance&#13;
&#13;
 between what things can be done quickly, what things take&#13;
&#13;
 longer, what the interactions are, and the importance of&#13;
&#13;
 getting on with it and not trying to solve everything&#13;
&#13;
 ahead of time.    So, we do say these things about pacing&#13;
&#13;
 and sequencing.&#13;
&#13;
           I think Mike will say a little more about&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, but I do think -- let me just say one thing&#13;
&#13;
 briefly -- there are lots of things that you can do like&#13;
&#13;
 reforming legal systems, anti-corruption, improvement of&#13;
&#13;
 public delivery systems by involving the customers more,&#13;
&#13;
 a lot of things which you can do which are political at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 one level but are not a kind of intense politics of the&#13;
&#13;
 party and big interest group kind that some of the&#13;
&#13;
 interventions were referring to.&#13;
&#13;
             We do have to be careful, but there is a lot&#13;
&#13;
 that we can do on empowerment which should be welcome and&#13;
&#13;
 is not as sensitive as actions in other areas of&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment.&#13;
&#13;
             Briefly on the measurement of social variables,&#13;
&#13;
 political variables, it does involve some kind of&#13;
&#13;
 judgment.    Actually too does measurement of economic&#13;
&#13;
 variables.     It involves a lot of judgment, as anyone who&#13;
&#13;
 has tried to do it will know.        But I think if you have&#13;
&#13;
 properly structured judgment of social political&#13;
&#13;
 variables, based on careful survey evidence of, for&#13;
&#13;
 example, what enterprises are doing and how far are they&#13;
&#13;
 prevented from acting by bureaucratic harassment, what&#13;
&#13;
 sort of bribes they have to pay to do what, how does the&#13;
&#13;
 legal system work, you can with carefully structured&#13;
&#13;
 questions and survey evidence I think get some serious&#13;
&#13;
 quantitative evidence.&#13;
&#13;
             It doesn't look quite as hard as economic&#13;
&#13;
 evidence, but I think nevertheless it is something which&#13;
&#13;
 we should use.     We are often asked to go beyond economics&#13;
&#13;
 to the other social sciences, rightly so.            And I think&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 when you do that, you can also use structured&#13;
&#13;
 quantitative evidence.&#13;
&#13;
             Use it with care, emphasize the elements of&#13;
&#13;
 judgments that are involved, but I think we nevertheless&#13;
&#13;
 should use it if we are looking at a broader approach to&#13;
&#13;
 what creates economic growth and poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
             I, of course, welcome with enthusiasm the&#13;
&#13;
 importance of involving DEC more closely and still more&#13;
&#13;
 closely in the operational and strategic activities of&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank.    That is indeed what was argued I think in the&#13;
&#13;
 paper which Jo Ritzen presented to you not so long ago&#13;
&#13;
 and it is certainly a theme which I embrace with some&#13;
&#13;
 enthusiasm.&#13;
&#13;
             So, let me pass over to Nora.&#13;
&#13;
             MS. LUSTIG:   Thank you, Nick.&#13;
&#13;
             I will complement some of your comments.       First&#13;
&#13;
 of all, let me thank everybody that has participated so&#13;
&#13;
 far for all your very useful observations and also a&#13;
&#13;
 number of specific comments that we will be taking into&#13;
&#13;
 account as we prepare the final draft of the report.         I&#13;
&#13;
 found them very important and I am sure the rest of the&#13;
&#13;
 team did.&#13;
&#13;
             I want to talk about four issues.       There was a&#13;
&#13;
 question raised about what have we learned from past&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 experience, particularly in the area of labor-intensive&#13;
&#13;
 growth, and what have we learned in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation of the WDR 1990.       I think Mike will refer&#13;
&#13;
 specifically to the OED study that has looked at this.&#13;
&#13;
 But I just wanted to say one thing and related to one of&#13;
&#13;
 the gaps that Mr. Singh mentioned in his gap analysis of&#13;
&#13;
 what happens to developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
            I think that there is evidence that labor-&#13;
&#13;
 intensive growth and skill labor-intensive growth has not&#13;
&#13;
 been pervasive, particularly when you look at the fact&#13;
&#13;
 that the wage premia to higher scales has been on the&#13;
&#13;
 rise.   And this is a result that is pretty general in&#13;
&#13;
 many, many countries, whether they have or not undertaken&#13;
&#13;
 reforms.   In some cases, it has been identified that some&#13;
&#13;
 of the reforms in the process of being implemented could&#13;
&#13;
 have contributed to that; particularly where you had a&#13;
&#13;
 trade system that protected labor-intensive&#13;
&#13;
 manufacturing, the liberalization of labor-intensive&#13;
&#13;
 manufacturing could have contributed to some extent to&#13;
&#13;
 this widening gap.&#13;
&#13;
            However, what seems to be occurring is a&#13;
&#13;
 nominal shift in technological change that is skill&#13;
&#13;
 biased, and that is not only affecting developing&#13;
&#13;
 countries but also rich countries.        That puts an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 increasing burden in the catching up on the education and&#13;
&#13;
 skill creation front in order for countries to be part of&#13;
&#13;
 the opportunities that greater integration in the world&#13;
&#13;
 may bring.&#13;
&#13;
           The other thing that we have learned -- I&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned it briefly in my presentation -- to the extent&#13;
&#13;
 that we can look at information is on the investment in&#13;
&#13;
 human development, particularly investing more in&#13;
&#13;
 education and health, is that, first of all, there hasn't&#13;
&#13;
 been a systematic collecting of the information that&#13;
&#13;
 would allow you to make a thorough assessment, and that&#13;
&#13;
 is a very important thing to note because it already&#13;
&#13;
 signals something to us.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, if you look at the information that is&#13;
&#13;
 available, it has been growing but less than GDP in&#13;
&#13;
 developing countries.    So, there hasn't been particular&#13;
&#13;
 emphasis in this kind of investment.         And thirdly, that&#13;
&#13;
 it continues to be quite regressive in some countries on&#13;
&#13;
 what percentage of the spending in education and health&#13;
&#13;
 reaches actually the bottom 10 or 20 percent.        It tends&#13;
&#13;
 to be well below the 20 percent if you were in an equal&#13;
&#13;
 distribution of the spending.&#13;
&#13;
           And finally, the fact that this is more based&#13;
&#13;
 on case specific studies that not necessarily spending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 delivers outcomes.   Therefore, there has to be more to be&#13;
&#13;
 done in order to actually ensure that if you put more&#13;
&#13;
 resources to some areas, you are going to have better&#13;
&#13;
 results.   And this leads us to the discussion of&#13;
&#13;
 improving the institutions, particularly through local&#13;
&#13;
 monitoring and involving much more the communities in the&#13;
&#13;
 design, implementation, monitoring, evaluation of the&#13;
&#13;
 systems that deliver social services.&#13;
&#13;
            The second sort of comments I wanted to make is&#13;
&#13;
 to complement what Nick was saying on economic reforms.&#13;
&#13;
 I don't know if the messages do not come out clear&#13;
&#13;
 enough, but what we would like to see come out from the&#13;
&#13;
 messages in the WDR is that the evidence shows that on&#13;
&#13;
 average economic reforms deliver better growth outcomes&#13;
&#13;
 and that these reforms include the basic elements that&#13;
&#13;
 are outlined here as part of the Washington consensus in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of macroeconomic stability, greater openness to&#13;
&#13;
 trade, and privatization of state enterprises and&#13;
&#13;
 eliminating growth over regulation that stifles the&#13;
&#13;
 development of private enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
            Also, evidence seems to show that on average&#13;
&#13;
 there is no impact on income distribution of reforms.&#13;
&#13;
 They are not necessarily more unequalizing or more&#13;
&#13;
 equalizing, although in specific cases we will find they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 are unequalizing and sometimes they are equalizing.              But&#13;
&#13;
 what the report also wants to emphasize is that failed&#13;
&#13;
 reforms are very costly.     They are very costly in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of growth collapses; they are costly in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 resources, that if you have to allocate 20 percent of GDP&#13;
&#13;
 to rescue the banking sector because it went awry, those&#13;
&#13;
 are resources you can use for other purposes.            And,&#13;
&#13;
 therefore, careful attention has to be placed to the way&#13;
&#13;
 in which reforms that are more prone, if you want, to get&#13;
&#13;
 into trouble are contextualized, have the institutional&#13;
&#13;
 foundations and you have the regulatory framework to&#13;
&#13;
 ensure that the benefits will be there.            That is the&#13;
&#13;
 second important message.&#13;
&#13;
           This doesn't mean that you have to go more&#13;
&#13;
 gradually.   In some cases, you may actually have to speed&#13;
&#13;
 up the pace of reforms.    Rent-seeking opportunities&#13;
&#13;
 emerge often because reforms are half baked and,&#13;
&#13;
 therefore, proceeding more quickly might be an answer to&#13;
&#13;
 address this issue.&#13;
&#13;
           The third point that we want to make in this&#13;
&#13;
 relation to economic reforms is that an assessment of the&#13;
&#13;
 distributive implications and who would be the losers and&#13;
&#13;
 how much to some extent the reforms will produce in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of losses has to be an inherent part of the reform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 agenda, and that to the extent that it is feasible within&#13;
&#13;
 the context of public resources, institutional capacity,&#13;
&#13;
 et cetera, compensatory schemes have to be set in place.&#13;
&#13;
            There was a comment made that we are putting&#13;
&#13;
 this in the context of a moral imperative.          I think that&#13;
&#13;
 maybe our entire report is based on a moral imperative,&#13;
&#13;
 which is attacking poverty.       So, to that extent we are&#13;
&#13;
 not doing differently when we discuss how to deal with&#13;
&#13;
 the losers of reforms and how we deal with poverty&#13;
&#13;
 overall.&#13;
&#13;
            The third point I want to mention is I think it&#13;
&#13;
 has been raised by several of you whether we deal with&#13;
&#13;
 the issue of inequality to the extent that we should or&#13;
&#13;
 are we maybe trying to go into areas that are more&#13;
&#13;
 difficult to address such as imbedded in inequalities.             I&#13;
&#13;
 think the report offers a wide array of areas of action&#13;
&#13;
 where you can address inequality in ways that are not&#13;
&#13;
 necessarily disruptive and that using existing resources&#13;
&#13;
 you could do so.&#13;
&#13;
            Also, there are areas in which you are going to&#13;
&#13;
 have to add resources, but maybe a decision to relocate&#13;
&#13;
 may be the right thing to do.       And, as Nick mentioned,&#13;
&#13;
 there are things that can be done that do not require&#13;
&#13;
 resources that have to do more with legislation, the way&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 legislation is applied, the way certain patterns of, if&#13;
&#13;
 you want, unequal treatment in society to the socially&#13;
&#13;
 disadvantaged have to do more with customary practices,&#13;
&#13;
 norms and values.     They may be harder to change because&#13;
&#13;
 they are not necessarily the result of applying&#13;
&#13;
 resources, but nonetheless it is an area that we think&#13;
&#13;
 has to be given emphasis.       And we bring this to the fore&#13;
&#13;
 in the report.&#13;
&#13;
           And finally, a comment on the issue of&#13;
&#13;
 decentralization.     I think that the report tried to take&#13;
&#13;
 a realistic approach towards decentralization without&#13;
&#13;
 celebrating it in an idealistic way, but noting the&#13;
&#13;
 advantages that this can bring, but what kind of rules&#13;
&#13;
 you need to have in order to make sure that&#13;
&#13;
 decentralization really delivers to poor people and does&#13;
&#13;
 not become captured by local elites and what are the&#13;
&#13;
 rules that are necessary or what are the resources that&#13;
&#13;
 are necessary to make decentralization effective in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of availability of resources and capacity building;&#13;
&#13;
 otherwise, you might not be able to succeed in actually&#13;
&#13;
 achieving what you set out to do through the process of&#13;
&#13;
 divesting power to the local.&#13;

&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:      I think we should get started&#13;
&#13;
 again.   We will start with Mike, the few remaining points&#13;
&#13;
 to be made from our side.       And then, I have eight names -&#13;
&#13;
 - Brandt, Davidse, Oya, Pickford, Almofadhi, Sayed, Lvin&#13;
&#13;
 and Moulin.   That should cover it.&#13;
&#13;
           Mike.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WALTON:     Thank you.      I just wanted to pick&#13;
&#13;
 up on a few of the questions concerning the operation&#13;
&#13;
 implications.     As I said initially, we will be working on&#13;
&#13;
 this in the coming months.       DEC, the networks and the&#13;
&#13;
 regions will be working with senior management on this.&#13;
&#13;
           A few things, one clarification.           A couple of&#13;
&#13;
 people asked about why there wasn't an assessment of&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank experience.      As is customary, we don't usually&#13;
&#13;
 go into that in any structured way in World Development&#13;
&#13;
 Reports, but we did have the OED major review that we&#13;
&#13;
 discussed I think in March, as well as the ongoing&#13;
&#13;
 poverty progress reports.       And as we turn to the&#13;
&#13;
 operational implications, we will very much use those&#13;
&#13;
 assessments of the World Bank experience in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 formulating them.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
             On the substance, the main thing I would like&#13;
&#13;
 to talk a little bit about is the implications under the&#13;
&#13;
 area of empowerment because a number of Executive&#13;
&#13;
 Directors raised that.     Perhaps as a point of departure,&#13;
&#13;
 I could pick up on part of Nora's response to the&#13;
&#13;
 question of how countries did in implementing the 1990&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.    And she referred to the fact that in the&#13;
&#13;
 domain of the social sectors, while the experience over&#13;
&#13;
 the last ten years does show that indeed schools, health&#13;
&#13;
 centers, water are indeed important for improving well-&#13;
&#13;
 being, that what we have learned is that the strategy&#13;
&#13;
 laid out in 1990, which was fundamentally one of&#13;
&#13;
 expanding investment in social services, especially&#13;
&#13;
 expanding public investment in social services, was too&#13;
&#13;
 limited; that there are extraordinarily varied&#13;
&#13;
 experiences in the consequences of even public investment&#13;
&#13;
 in social services.    And this is as we interpret it and&#13;
&#13;
 as the sector experts and practitioners in this area&#13;
&#13;
 interpret this, it is very much linked to institutional&#13;
&#13;
 functioning.&#13;
&#13;
             You can even have, as we have results from&#13;
&#13;
 different countries, different states, extraordinarily&#13;
&#13;
 effective schooling in one area and very ineffective&#13;
&#13;
 schooling in another area.      It can only be understood in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 terms of how the public sector functions, in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 interface between the public sector and the communities&#13;
&#13;
 that they are serving.     And this is a central theme of&#13;
&#13;
 the report.    It comes into both the question of how to&#13;
&#13;
 build up assets, but it relates to the point of why the&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank should be concerned in an operational what is&#13;
&#13;
 grouped under empowerment.&#13;
&#13;
             Within that, I would like to reiterate the&#13;
&#13;
 point that Nick made, that, of course, the areas under&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment are often intrinsically political, just as&#13;
&#13;
 very many policy decisions are.        And, as we all know,&#13;
&#13;
 there are domains of politics which the World Bank cannot&#13;
&#13;
 get into.    As development practitioners, it is often&#13;
&#13;
 important that we are cognizant of these broader&#13;
&#13;
 genuinely political developments, but as the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
 we cannot take any intrusive position in that; we cannot&#13;
&#13;
 get involved in that.&#13;
&#13;
             Having said that, as Nick already suggested,&#13;
&#13;
 there are a number of important central practical domains&#13;
&#13;
 under the empowerment area that we judge to be essential&#13;
&#13;
 for development effectiveness.        And many of these areas&#13;
&#13;
 we are already involved in.&#13;
&#13;
             If we take the area of participation, there are&#13;
&#13;
 many aspects of participation that are central to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 effective implementation.     As the report refers, there is&#13;
&#13;
 work in the water sector, for instance, that shows where&#13;
&#13;
 you have effective participation in terms of rural water&#13;
&#13;
 supply, you get better returns, better water systems, and&#13;
&#13;
 this is a strong empirical result.&#13;
&#13;
           There is considerable work summarized in here&#13;
&#13;
 about the central role of community participation in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of getting effective schooling.         These are just&#13;
&#13;
 illustrations of the broader point that the participation&#13;
&#13;
 agenda is an aspect that we see as central to our core&#13;
&#13;
 work and does not necessarily take us into areas that go&#13;
&#13;
 beyond our mandate.&#13;
&#13;
           There is a whole set of other areas which have&#13;
&#13;
 been referred to about the broader question of how to&#13;
&#13;
 make institutions effective.      And I would like to pick up&#13;
&#13;
 on a point that Mr. Zhu made about the Chinese&#13;
&#13;
 experience.   I think we would strongly feel that we&#13;
&#13;
 learned from East Asia and in particular about aspects of&#13;
&#13;
 the Chinese experience, as you said, about the importance&#13;
&#13;
 of effective and the importance of responsive&#13;
&#13;
 institutions.&#13;
&#13;
           As many scholars of the East Asian experience&#13;
&#13;
 argue that it was abundantly true that growth, and&#13;
&#13;
 especially in some of the countries, not all of them,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 equitable growth was crucial to income poverty gains and&#13;
&#13;
 also underpinned some of the gains in other dimensions of&#13;
&#13;
 well being.&#13;
&#13;
           A central aspect of that was the institutional&#13;
&#13;
 that allowed such a growth and management of aspects of&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability to take place.&#13;
&#13;
           I specifically would like to get back to some&#13;
&#13;
 question raised on the Voices of the Poor.          We see this&#13;
&#13;
 as important.   Indeed, we see this in many cases critical&#13;
&#13;
 input to a process of engagement to discover the nature&#13;
&#13;
 of poverty, discover what matters for poor communities&#13;
&#13;
 and also as a means to have poor communities involved in&#13;
&#13;
 the design, tracking and getting greater accountability&#13;
&#13;
 in implementation.&#13;
&#13;
           We would fully agree that there are issues of&#13;
&#13;
 sampling, issues that this will refer to only specific&#13;
&#13;
 communities and that this does not constitute a&#13;
&#13;
 structured evaluation of an intervention.          It is often a&#13;
&#13;
 subjective impression of the conditions of life and a&#13;
&#13;
 subjective impression of what does and does not work.          I&#13;
&#13;
 would add an extraordinarily well-informed subjective&#13;
&#13;
 impression because these are coming from the lives of&#13;
&#13;
 poor people.&#13;

                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           But in our work, we see this as essentially&#13;
&#13;
 complemented by other instruments, instruments of inquiry&#13;
&#13;
 such as household surveys and instruments of evaluation&#13;
&#13;
 of what does and does not work and a whole direction of&#13;
&#13;
 the techniques that we are advising on in terms of how to&#13;
&#13;
 discover what does and does not work is moving in the&#13;
&#13;
 direction of systematically integrating quantitative and&#13;
&#13;
 qualitative methods, that these are complementary tools&#13;
&#13;
 and not substitutes.&#13;
&#13;
           Two other quick points on this area of&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, I would like to certainly recognize the&#13;
&#13;
 point that Mr. Singh made that within this area,&#13;
&#13;
 especially for highly disadvantaged groups it can be very&#13;
&#13;
 important deal with the complex question of how to build&#13;
&#13;
 the capacity to engage in the development process.     And&#13;
&#13;
 some of our ongoing work, especially in the community&#13;
&#13;
 development area, is already directly engaged with this.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, there was a question on the complexity&#13;
&#13;
 of dealing with questions of social barriers, social&#13;
&#13;
 norms.   I think we have to recognize that that is a very&#13;
&#13;
 complicated position for a development institution that,&#13;
&#13;
 on the one hand, is committed to an overall approach to&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction and, on the other hand, recognizes the&#13;
&#13;
 existence of cultural diversity.&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           What I would say on that is that we are&#13;
&#13;
 escapably already within that situation -- and I would&#13;
&#13;
 illustrate that with gender -- that as an institution, we&#13;
&#13;
 like many institutions, are strongly committed to gender&#13;
&#13;
 equity.   And we are committed to that both as an end in&#13;
&#13;
 itself and, as has been mentioned this morning, because&#13;
&#13;
 there is increasing empirical evidence that greater&#13;
&#13;
 gender equity brings instrumental benefits for other&#13;
&#13;
 aspects of development and poverty reduction.      This&#13;
&#13;
 involves a rather complicated relationship where with&#13;
&#13;
 societies, including local societies, where the local&#13;
&#13;
 norms involve inequities between genders.&#13;
&#13;
           Now the only thing I would say here, and I&#13;
&#13;
 think it flows directly from the report, is we have to&#13;
&#13;
 recognize that complexity and work within this.     And one&#13;
&#13;
 of the techniques for working within that that was&#13;
&#13;
 actually a technique used within the Voices of the Poor&#13;
&#13;
 is when we engage to recognize that there are different&#13;
&#13;
 groups within a society and, for example, seek ways of&#13;
&#13;
 giving voice for women's groups, that was a technique in&#13;
&#13;
 the Voices of the Poor to make sure that there was not&#13;
&#13;
 only a broad investigation of what mattered but&#13;
&#13;
 separately meeting with men and women and men's and&#13;
&#13;
 women's groups, and it is a technique that we are&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 familiar with, for example, in the Grameen Bank's work on&#13;
&#13;
 microcredit, which has a systematic bias for working with&#13;
&#13;
 women, partly with the objective of empowerment, however&#13;
&#13;
 we use that phrase.&#13;
&#13;
           Another area I quickly would like to comment&#13;
&#13;
 on, a lot of people commented on the point this is&#13;
&#13;
 extraordinarily complex; what does one do in practice?&#13;
&#13;
 Here let me make three points:        first, to strongly&#13;
&#13;
 support the view made by Mr. Gomes that we would very&#13;
&#13;
 much see this as an input to the domestic formulation of&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategies, as we have been discussing in the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP, that we do see a role for the design of our own&#13;
&#13;
 analytical work.   There was a comment made on the role of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty assessments in helping sift through what the&#13;
&#13;
 priorities are within a particular context.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it is perfectly consistent to say that&#13;
&#13;
 these three pillars are strongly complementary, will to&#13;
&#13;
 some degree always apply.      But when we get into a&#13;
&#13;
 particular context, there will be very sharp priorities.&#13;
&#13;
           Some of the priorities one can generate about&#13;
&#13;
 and on some one cannot.     And we do see analytical as a&#13;
&#13;
 way of underpinning that where countries have a weak&#13;
&#13;
 capacity in that case.     We will be discussing that&#13;
&#13;
 further when we come back to discuss how we go about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 poverty diagnosis.    The general direction that we are&#13;
&#13;
 advocating and already moving is to link poverty&#13;
&#13;
 diagnosis much more firmly to the evaluation of&#13;
&#13;
 alternative choices over public actions and to the&#13;
&#13;
 structure of an economy.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, I would add that following this&#13;
&#13;
 report, again working across the Bank, there will be&#13;
&#13;
 considerable work working through the implications in&#13;
&#13;
 practice.    And I would again cite the poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy source book as one of the areas where this will&#13;
&#13;
 be fleshed out.    As we have mentioned before, that source&#13;
&#13;
 book is very much Internet work and a DEC, PREM and WBI&#13;
&#13;
 collaboration.    In our next round we are trying to both&#13;
&#13;
 use that to give kind of a thirty-page account about how&#13;
&#13;
 to think of these issues in a very aggregate form, as&#13;
&#13;
 well as a much deeper account of, for example, how would&#13;
&#13;
 you design a public works' scheme to manage natural&#13;
&#13;
 disasters or how to do that to reach the truly&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
             And a final specific comment concerns the&#13;
&#13;
 development assistance.     We certainly recognize that&#13;
&#13;
 getting coordination across donors is very difficult.     I&#13;
&#13;
 think we would be a little bit more optimistic about some&#13;
&#13;
 of the progress in some countries about how we are moving&#13;
&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 in that, especially under the PRSP countries and we have&#13;
&#13;
 seen that the early CDF countries that are implementing&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSP have the best experience so far.&#13;
&#13;
            The one thing I would add to that is about the&#13;
&#13;
 code of conduct.     I think that is a very good point.      The&#13;
&#13;
 OECD DAC are in the middle of developing guidelines for&#13;
&#13;
 development assistance in the poverty arena, and we hope&#13;
&#13;
 that over time that will be a useful contribution, as you&#13;
&#13;
 suggested.&#13;

            Thank you.&#13;

            MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you, Mike.&#13;
&#13;
            Anna Brandt, please.&#13;
&#13;
            MS. BRANDT:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            I would like to thank Nick Stern and Nora and&#13;
&#13;
 Mike for their responses to some of the interventions&#13;
&#13;
 that have been given so far.        I think that has been very&#13;
&#13;
 helpful.     And I was especially pleased to hear Mike's&#13;
&#13;
 comments just right now.       I think there were a lot of&#13;
&#13;
 good things there that I can fully support.&#13;
&#13;
            I want to start by truly commending the team&#13;
&#13;
 for a path-breaking, impressive report which highlights&#13;
&#13;
 the complex nature of poverty and the interlinkages&#13;
&#13;
 between economic, social and political factors.       We&#13;
&#13;
 particularly appreciate the integration of the political&#13;

&#13;
 institutional analysis with the economic analysis and the&#13;
&#13;
 attention paid to political economy.&#13;
&#13;
           I think this report is answering numerous calls&#13;
&#13;
 for more comprehensive analyses of poverty that have been&#13;
&#13;
 directed towards the Bank in the last decade.         And it&#13;
&#13;
 really represents a lot of new thinking that we hope will&#13;
&#13;
 shape the development debate over the coming years.&#13;
&#13;
           We, therefore, believe that it is very&#13;
&#13;
 important that we have a clear strategy for promoting and&#13;
&#13;
 discussing the WDR in the coming year.         I noted in Mike's&#13;
&#13;
 initial intervention that he talked a bit about how he&#13;
&#13;
 hoped this WDR will spur follow-up debates, and that I&#13;
&#13;
 think we very much support.&#13;
&#13;
           I would also be interested in hearing a bit&#13;
&#13;
 more about the strategy for targeting key audiences with&#13;
&#13;
 this report and how you are planning to move ahead with&#13;
&#13;
 that.&#13;
&#13;
           We believe that the consultative process in&#13;
&#13;
 developing this WDR has been exceptional.          It has&#13;
&#13;
 admittedly not made life easy for the team, but it has&#13;
&#13;
 contributed immensely to the breadth of the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
 And we would hope that there now are mechanisms in place&#13;
&#13;
 to institutionalize participatory consultative processes.&#13;
&#13;
 And like Mr. Biskup, I would hope that the WDR is not&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 just a one-off in this respect but that we will find ways&#13;
&#13;
 in using this experience in other relevant circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
           Just like Mike recently said, we believe that&#13;
&#13;
 the Voice of the Poor was a critical input in developing&#13;
&#13;
 this WDR, and we think that the many quotations from the&#13;
&#13;
 Voices of the Poor and the many country examples given&#13;
&#13;
 throughout the report contribute to the unusual richness&#13;
&#13;
 of it.&#13;
&#13;
           We also appreciate that this report is truly&#13;
&#13;
 global.   There are numerous examples from all over the&#13;
&#13;
 world, including the ECA Region which we particularly&#13;
&#13;
 appreciate, and actually also some examples from the&#13;
&#13;
 developed countries like the U.S., and I think this shows&#13;
&#13;
 that poverty is not only a developing country problem.&#13;
&#13;
           The report's comprehensiveness is, however,&#13;
&#13;
 also somewhat problematic.     Because of the length of the&#13;
&#13;
 report, it is extremely important that all the relevant&#13;
&#13;
 findings and the main messages and policy recommendations&#13;
&#13;
 be reflected in the overview.      We have to admit that the&#13;
&#13;
 overview is actually what most people will read.&#13;
&#13;
           Therefore, we feel that it needs to be worked&#13;
&#13;
 on more to integrate all these findings.           And likewise,&#13;
&#13;
 we feel that the President's cover letter, the foreword,&#13;
&#13;
 we would hope that that could capture the importance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the WDR's findings and the relevance they have for the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank's operations.&#13;
&#13;
           Another presentational issue is the conclusions&#13;
&#13;
 ending each chapter.     We feel that these aren't really&#13;
&#13;
 proper conclusions but rather a sort of bridge to the&#13;
&#13;
 following chapter.     And we believe that further work&#13;
&#13;
 needs to be done on these conclusions to really make them&#13;
&#13;
 into true conclusions.     As they stand now, we don't feel&#13;
&#13;
 that they do justice to the richness of the analyses in&#13;
&#13;
 the main text.&#13;
&#13;
           On substance, my authorities have been closely&#13;
&#13;
 involved in the process of developing the WDR, from&#13;
&#13;
 contributing to the financing of the Voices of the Poor&#13;
&#13;
 study to hosting consultations in two of our capitals.&#13;
&#13;
 We have been very supportive of the general thrust of the&#13;
&#13;
 WDR and specifically the three-pronged approach to&#13;
&#13;
 attacking poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           Comments were submitted on the consultation&#13;
&#13;
 draft, and I am pleased to note that a number of them&#13;
&#13;
 have been taken into account.      However, I have been asked&#13;
&#13;
 by my authorities to convey for the record that they are&#13;
&#13;
 somewhat disappointed that the order of the three pillars&#13;
&#13;
 has been changed in the new version.         I am well aware of&#13;
&#13;
 the fact that there is no ranking between these pillars&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 and appreciating Nick Stern's clarification on why there&#13;
&#13;
 should be no hierarchy, and I fully agree on that, they&#13;
&#13;
 still feel that the previous order was more logical and&#13;
&#13;
 beneficial.&#13;
&#13;
           Indeed, testimony from the Voices of the Poor&#13;
&#13;
 confirmed that empowerment and security are prerequisites&#13;
&#13;
 for poor women and men to be able to grasp economic&#13;
&#13;
 opportunities.   I know a number of speakers have argued&#13;
&#13;
 for the opposite, but I think one can also argue for this&#13;
&#13;
 case.&#13;
&#13;
           I think in paragraph 3.26 there is argument to&#13;
&#13;
 the tune of the fact that social barriers need to be&#13;
&#13;
 eliminated in order to make growth more broad-based.     And&#13;
&#13;
 furthermore, my authorities feel that it would be&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate to present the new and more innovative&#13;
&#13;
 approach first in the report and then the more familiar&#13;
&#13;
 aspects of poverty at a later stage.&#13;
&#13;
           Now I would like to turn to some more specific&#13;
&#13;
 comments of the report, and I think we have somewhat&#13;
&#13;
 different views, as do many of the speakers that have&#13;
&#13;
 spoken before me.     So, I beg for your indulgence of being&#13;
&#13;
 a bit detailed here in my comments.&#13;
&#13;
           We welcome the message on the importance of&#13;
&#13;
 economic growth with equity for poverty reduction, but we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 do feel that the equity dimension and the distributional&#13;
&#13;
 aspects of growth could have been brought even more to&#13;
&#13;
 the fore.    And I think that was what Mr. Singh was trying&#13;
&#13;
 to say also earlier this morning, and I agree with him on&#13;
&#13;
 that aspect.&#13;
&#13;
             We also believe that this chapter should&#13;
&#13;
 address the intra-household poverty effects of growth.&#13;
&#13;
 How growth affects women and children differently from&#13;
&#13;
 men is an important question that needs to be answered if&#13;
&#13;
 we are to understand the links between growth and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.    And this also points to the need for gender and&#13;
&#13;
 age disaggregated data.     We would hope that the WDR could&#13;
&#13;
 make a contribution to the development of data on the&#13;
&#13;
 basis of individuals rather than households.        And I know&#13;
&#13;
 this is a difficult endeavor and it will take time, but&#13;
&#13;
 we are hoping that we could move towards individually&#13;
&#13;
 disaggregated data, at least over the medium and long-&#13;
&#13;
 term.&#13;
&#13;
             We also feel that this chapter, Chapter 3,&#13;
&#13;
 could be more explicit on the interrelationship between&#13;
&#13;
 the three pillars and growth.       Increased empowerment and&#13;
&#13;
 security provide poor people with the opportunity to&#13;
&#13;
 contribute to economic growth, and I think these&#13;
&#13;
 interlinkages could have been more explored.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           On the effects of reforms on the poor -- and&#13;
&#13;
 this is Chapter 4 -- we feel that the previous version&#13;
&#13;
 painted a more balanced view by highlighting differences&#13;
&#13;
 in outcomes due to differences in social, political and&#13;
&#13;
 economic contexts.    The new version focuses on aggregate&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes, and these tend to iron out differences and&#13;
&#13;
 seems to be trying to avoid talking about the negative&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes that do exist in some instances.&#13;
&#13;
           Thus, we feel it is not as helpful in guiding&#13;
&#13;
 us to understand why some reforms and which reforms&#13;
&#13;
 benefit the poor most, because in our mind we have to&#13;
&#13;
 remember that to reduce poverty, we cannot just be&#13;
&#13;
 satisfied that economic reforms do not hurt the poor more&#13;
&#13;
 than the less poor.   We strongly believe that we have to&#13;
&#13;
 design economic reforms so they especially benefit the&#13;
&#13;
 poor if we are to make a difference in terms of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction in the long run.&#13;
&#13;
           And in relation to this, it is stated on&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph 2.28 on page 2.9 that a relatively neglected&#13;
&#13;
 areas if market reform, especially targeted to poor&#13;
&#13;
 people.   And I am wondering where this issue is then&#13;
&#13;
 being developed in the report later.         I couldn't find it,&#13;
&#13;
 but if you can point me to the right place, I would be&#13;
&#13;
 very happy.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
             In Chapter 5, there is a section on public&#13;
&#13;
 spending, but here the importance of transparent and&#13;
&#13;
 predictable budget allocations and an accountable budget&#13;
&#13;
 system is not developed.      And we feel it would be&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate in that context to discuss the role of public&#13;
&#13;
 expenditure reviews.     But this important instrument is&#13;
&#13;
 not mentioned until Chapter 9 and thus it is only in the&#13;
&#13;
 context of responding to a crisis that the PER is&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned.    And we feel that it is important to address&#13;
&#13;
 this issue more upfront in a general public spending&#13;
&#13;
 context.&#13;
&#13;
             The negative effects on the poor of introducing&#13;
&#13;
 cost recovery through user charges in health and&#13;
&#13;
 education should also be recognized in this context, not&#13;
&#13;
 just indirectly by reference to Box 5.3 but also&#13;
&#13;
 explicitly in the text.&#13;
&#13;
             We feel Chapter 6 goes a long way in addressing&#13;
&#13;
 a number of non-economic issues and we strongly welcome&#13;
&#13;
 this.   We also like the discussion on social capital in&#13;
&#13;
 Chapter 7, although we think that more elaboration could&#13;
&#13;
 have been given on how to support these positive forces.&#13;
&#13;
 And the discussion now is more focused on the social&#13;
&#13;
 barriers.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           This chapter also deals with gender more&#13;
&#13;
 explicitly, although gender aspects are mainstreamed in&#13;
&#13;
 all chapters, and that is a fact we very much appreciate&#13;
&#13;
 and I want to underline that.      And this is also a clear&#13;
&#13;
 improvement I think over the red cover version.&#13;
&#13;
           But the placing of the section on gender&#13;
&#13;
 discrimination and poverty is somewhat puzzling.            We&#13;
&#13;
 actually would have preferred that to be earlier in the&#13;
&#13;
 report.   And there are several reasons for this&#13;
&#13;
 preference of ours of wanting to bring it more upfront.&#13;
&#13;
 The first one is that gender discrimination actually&#13;
&#13;
 affects more than 50 percent of the world's population.&#13;
&#13;
           The second is that it involves intra-household&#13;
&#13;
 differentials in assigning value to people and allocating&#13;
&#13;
 values accordingly.   And this is a big difference in&#13;
&#13;
 comparison, for instance, to ethnic discrimination.&#13;
&#13;
           Thirdly, gender inequity has negative effects&#13;
&#13;
 on economic growth which is recognized in the report but&#13;
&#13;
 I think could be even more underscored.&#13;
&#13;
           Notwithstanding this, the analysis on gender we&#13;
&#13;
 think is good.   What we are lacking is a conclusion on&#13;
&#13;
 policy action to reduce gender discrimination and promote&#13;
&#13;
 greater equality between men and women.            And that we&#13;
&#13;
 would like to be highlighted in the overview, in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 overview conclusion, or whatever you want to call it.        It&#13;
&#13;
 is actually not very clear in the overview as it stands&#13;
&#13;
 right now.&#13;
&#13;
           We strongly welcome the chapter on global&#13;
&#13;
 actions and we recognize that some additional work has&#13;
&#13;
 been done over the previous version.         We very much like&#13;
&#13;
 that the discussion has been expanded to cover also trade&#13;
&#13;
 barriers, global financial stability and conflict&#13;
&#13;
 prevention.   And if possible, like some others have&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned, we would like to see these sections even more&#13;
&#13;
 elaborated upon, emphasizing the impact of developed&#13;
&#13;
 countries' actions on developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
           In particular, I think efforts in the post-&#13;
&#13;
 financial crisis area to strengthen the international&#13;
&#13;
 financial architecture could be elaborated upon as well&#13;
&#13;
 as the need for greater policy coherence of developed&#13;
&#13;
 countries' policies.&#13;
&#13;
           On Chapter 11, we feel that there is a need to&#13;
&#13;
 present a more balanced view on the support for&#13;
&#13;
 development cooperation.     The latest estimates that we&#13;
&#13;
 have from the DAC show that not only did we see a slight&#13;
&#13;
 increase in aid volumes between 1997 and 1998, but it&#13;
&#13;
 also looks as though the estimates for 1999 are pointing&#13;
&#13;
 to an increase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
             This means that if these estimates are&#13;
&#13;
 confirmed, we would actually be seeing two years of&#13;
&#13;
 consecutive growth in aid volumes.         In Chapter 11 there&#13;
&#13;
 is quite some elaboration on some donors decreasing aid,&#13;
&#13;
 but I want to emphasize that a number of donors are also&#13;
&#13;
 increasing their volumes.      Therefore, we feel that&#13;
&#13;
 sweeping terms like "aid fatigue" do not seem justified&#13;
&#13;
 and a more balanced picture should be presented.&#13;
&#13;
             We would also prefer to substitute the term&#13;
&#13;
 "development assistance" for the more up-to date&#13;
&#13;
 "development cooperation".      I think that better reflects&#13;
&#13;
 the underlying principles of the CDF and the PRSP, for&#13;
&#13;
 instance.&#13;
&#13;
             We fully support the suggestions made in&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph 11.45 for donor actions to improve development&#13;
&#13;
 cooperation, and I think very much linking to what Mike&#13;
&#13;
 said, these are also in line with what the DAC is trying&#13;
&#13;
 to promote.    And it would go a long way in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 satisfying Paulo's call for a code of conduct on donor&#13;
&#13;
 actions if we all could live up to what is said in&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph 11.45.&#13;
&#13;
             One thing that we lack in general in the report&#13;
&#13;
 -- and I don't know where it should be placed, so that is&#13;
&#13;
 why I am mentioning it towards the end -- that is the&#13;

&#13;
 linkages between poverty reduction and environmental&#13;
&#13;
 issues.   We feel that they should have been dealt with&#13;
&#13;
 more extensively somewhere in the report.          There is&#13;
&#13;
 admittedly recognition that environmental degradation&#13;
&#13;
 hurts the poor but we believe that the WDR also presents&#13;
&#13;
 an opportunity to emphasize the positive message that&#13;
&#13;
 environmental concerns need to be considered as a&#13;
&#13;
 component conducive to poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, the red cover version of the WDR had&#13;
&#13;
 some concluding suggestions and for reference these were&#13;
&#13;
 in paragraph 10.62 of the old version, four principles to&#13;
&#13;
 guide development cooperation based on the findings&#13;
&#13;
 throughout the report, and I interpreted these to be&#13;
&#13;
 principles to guide both the donor community but also&#13;
&#13;
 developing country governments in designing policies, and&#13;
&#13;
 we felt that these were very bold and innovative&#13;
&#13;
 suggestions and we supported them a lot.&#13;
&#13;
           We would suggest reinstating them in the&#13;
&#13;
 overview and would appreciate comments from the team on&#13;
&#13;
 that aspect.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, since I did say quite a lot and spoke&#13;
&#13;
 for some length, I would ask for your apologies.          I think&#13;
&#13;
 I am in good company today, but I would also like to&#13;

&#13;
 offer to circulate my statement in written form after the&#13;
&#13;
 meeting.&#13;
&#13;
            Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much.   You&#13;
&#13;
 certainly have a lot of company in this and we have some&#13;
&#13;
 way to go still.&#13;
&#13;
            Shin Oya, please.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. OYA:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            As other colleagues, I would like to&#13;
&#13;
 congratulate the WDR team for this excellent draft.         And&#13;
&#13;
 I have some comments but I would like to restrict my&#13;
&#13;
 comments to five major points.        We also will relate to&#13;
&#13;
 the paper which covers technical issues later.&#13;
&#13;
            And my comments are, first, on concept on&#13;
&#13;
 poverty; second, disaggregated data; third, on growth;&#13;
&#13;
 fourth, on sector-wide approach; fifth, on donor/NGO&#13;
&#13;
 relations.   And if I go beyond six minutes, Mr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
 please let me know.&#13;
&#13;
            First, on the concept of poverty, this WDR&#13;
&#13;
 examines and redefines the concept of poverty from&#13;
&#13;
 income, education and health to the one that includes&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability, voicelessness and powerlessness.       And&#13;
&#13;
 Voices of the Poor clearly showed last year that the poor&#13;
&#13;
 themselves consider the vulnerability of voicelessness&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 and powerlessness are the integral part of poverty.    As&#13;
&#13;
 the Chair mentioned, we have to be careful how to&#13;
&#13;
 effectively get the voices of the poor without bias.     And&#13;
&#13;
 it is also true that we have to improve the method to&#13;
&#13;
 measure these elements.&#13;
&#13;
           But I believe that the difficulty to capture or&#13;
&#13;
 measure these elements does not mean we can disregard&#13;
&#13;
 these important concepts.     As the WDR indicates, in order&#13;
&#13;
 to fight against poverty effectively, we have to deal&#13;
&#13;
 with the intrinsic battle of vulnerability, voicelessness&#13;
&#13;
 and powerlessness as well as the instrument battle of&#13;
&#13;
 these concepts.   So, we highly appreciate and fully&#13;
&#13;
 support the WDR's enlargement over the poverty concept.&#13;
&#13;
           And second, on the disaggregation of the&#13;
&#13;
 numbers -- and this was mentioned by Ms. Anna Brandt and&#13;
&#13;
 I share her view -- we support the point which is raised&#13;
&#13;
 in this WDR on the importance to disaggregate the various&#13;
&#13;
 numbers, especially that even in the same countries the&#13;
&#13;
 situation of poverty is different between the rural area&#13;
&#13;
 and urban area, between the coastal area and the inner&#13;
&#13;
 area, or among different ethnic groups.&#13;
&#13;
           Furthermore, inequality in households based on&#13;
&#13;
 gender, even though it is difficult to capture by&#13;
&#13;
 household surveys.   So we cannot overemphasize the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 importance of disaggregation and we appreciate the WDR's&#13;
&#13;
 clear recognition on this issue.&#13;
&#13;
           Third, on growth, we have to avoid the simple&#13;
&#13;
 dichotomy such as growth versus anti-growth, as many&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues indicated.    Growth is the engine and necessary&#13;
&#13;
 condition of poverty reduction but it is not a sufficient&#13;
&#13;
 condition.   We need sustainable and proper growth, and in&#13;
&#13;
 order to achieve that, we have to be careful about the&#13;
&#13;
 quality of growth and pattern of growth.&#13;
&#13;
           For example, in a society under which income&#13;
&#13;
 distribution is very unequal, first, growth cannot reach&#13;
&#13;
 the poor and, second, growth itself is not sustainable&#13;
&#13;
 due to the instability of the society.         Therefore, we&#13;
&#13;
 have to go beyond this dichotomy.&#13;
&#13;
           The important thing is to consider what is the&#13;
&#13;
 sustainable and proper goal based on the country's&#13;
&#13;
 specific condition.   In this regard, we are happy about&#13;
&#13;
 Mr. Stern's explanation at the beginning of the Board&#13;
&#13;
 discussion that the revision of the report from the&#13;
&#13;
 previous one on this matter is just to avoid the&#13;
&#13;
 impression of the Bank's downgrading growth.         I believe&#13;
&#13;
 it is important that we continue to pay attention on the&#13;
&#13;
 quality of the growth and pattern of the growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           And fourth, on sector-wide approach, we have to&#13;
&#13;
 use donor resources more efficiently and we support the&#13;
&#13;
 concept of sector-wide approach in this sense.       For&#13;
&#13;
 example, the cooperation with the donor community is very&#13;
&#13;
 successful I think.&#13;
&#13;
           We, however, do not believe that the sector-&#13;
&#13;
 wide approach necessarily means the common approach.       We&#13;
&#13;
 would like to mention this.&#13;
&#13;
           And fifth, with respect to donor/NGO relation&#13;
&#13;
 which is mentioned in Chapter 11, we support the idea of&#13;
&#13;
 continuous running about how to work effectively with&#13;
&#13;
 NGOs.   The WDR raises some issues like the scarcity of&#13;
&#13;
 good data on the extent and effectiveness of donor/NGO&#13;
&#13;
 relationship and the long-term impact of NGO projects.&#13;
&#13;
 So, we have to learn more about these issues, but we&#13;
&#13;
 believe that we can benefit a lot from good relation with&#13;
&#13;
 NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:      Thank you very much.   We may be&#13;
&#13;
 speeding up here.&#13;
&#13;
           Koen Davidse, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. DAVIDSE:      Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           I am afraid you are going to listen now to a&#13;
&#13;
 less eloquent rendition of Anna Brandt's statement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 because we have a lot of things in common.         But I think&#13;
&#13;
 you having heard her statement can help me cut some&#13;
&#13;
 corners.&#13;
&#13;
            This report depicts poverty as the complex&#13;
&#13;
 developmental problem it is.      Through the equal and&#13;
&#13;
 complementary mantras, as they were called this morning,&#13;
&#13;
 of empowerment, opportunity and security, it provides an&#13;
&#13;
 excellent overview of the current state of the art on&#13;
&#13;
 poverty alleviation.     And if there is a focus on&#13;
&#13;
 political or governance issues, it is in our view only as&#13;
&#13;
 far as they are an integral part of the difficult&#13;
&#13;
 development process.&#13;
&#13;
            We commend the team that has worked under&#13;
&#13;
 sometimes difficult circumstances under the able guidance&#13;
&#13;
 of Nora Lustig, Mike Walton and Jo Ritzen, and we also&#13;
&#13;
 commend them and Ravi Kanbur and Deepa Narayan on the&#13;
&#13;
 impressive consultative process.&#13;
&#13;
            This version has clearly provided us with a&#13;
&#13;
 more integrated concept of poverty reduction, but we do&#13;
&#13;
 have some suggestions.     On some points, the message of&#13;
&#13;
 change should be conveyed more broadly, like Matthias&#13;
&#13;
 Meyer and also Anna Brandt suggest.        Overall, the punch&#13;
&#13;
 line should be clarified in the conclusions and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 introductions of chapters, and this makes the overview&#13;
&#13;
 crucial.&#13;
&#13;
            I could focus on the many points we like about&#13;
&#13;
 the document, including the text on reform of aid, the&#13;
&#13;
 focus of institutions and governance, on empowerment and&#13;
&#13;
 participation, on decentralization with accountability&#13;
&#13;
 and the call for the removal of trade barriers by&#13;
&#13;
 developed countries.    But I am afraid instead I will&#13;
&#13;
 focus on some of the suggestions we have for further&#13;
&#13;
 changes on the basis of, of course, the views of my&#13;
&#13;
 authorities.&#13;
&#13;
            And I will focus on Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 7.   On&#13;
&#13;
 Chapter 3, I think it is clear that our recent review of&#13;
&#13;
 various HIPC cases has clearly demonstrated that growth&#13;
&#13;
 alone is not enough.    Good social policies and&#13;
&#13;
 redistribution of assets are key too.&#13;
&#13;
            Chapter 3 in the overview suggests so, but the&#13;
&#13;
 first part of the chapter should reflect the multi-&#13;
&#13;
 dimensional character of poverty better and, in our view,&#13;
&#13;
 just like the Nordic statement, also reflect the&#13;
&#13;
 interlinkages better.    To some extent, I feel this is a&#13;
&#13;
 presentational issue which Mr. Stern referred to at the&#13;
&#13;
 beginning of our discussion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            Opportunity was moved up and highlighting&#13;
&#13;
 growth more than the previous opener empowerment did.&#13;
&#13;
 And I think moving up issues from later in the chapter,&#13;
&#13;
 as well as strengthening the introduction and that&#13;
&#13;
 conclusion, 3.37, would help.&#13;
&#13;
            On Chapter 4, we feel that the beginning of&#13;
&#13;
 this chapter on market reforms creates the impression of&#13;
&#13;
 business as usual, and the conclusion of Chapter 4, which&#13;
&#13;
 is paragraph 4.54, strikes us as too ambivalent on&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.   The chapter should convey a stronger proactive&#13;
&#13;
 commitment to pro-poor growth.&#13;
&#13;
            The basic conclusion one could draw from&#13;
&#13;
 Chapter 4 is that market reforms are easier said than&#13;
&#13;
 done.   Therefore, we would have welcomed more thorough&#13;
&#13;
 guidance on how to make them tailor-made and pro-poor at&#13;
&#13;
 the same time, which of course is a very tall order.&#13;
&#13;
            In the view of my authorities, the chapter is&#13;
&#13;
 less critical and less balanced than Chapter 8 of the&#13;
&#13;
 previous draft, and this, of course, will be noticed.&#13;
&#13;
 Recent studies have emphasized that different strategies&#13;
&#13;
 of economic growth with different combinations and&#13;
&#13;
 sequencing are possible, and this could perhaps be better&#13;
&#13;
 reflected and a reference was made in the comments I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 received to the interventions at the ABCDE conference&#13;
&#13;
 actually in Paris.&#13;
&#13;
             One specific issue we raised with staff&#13;
&#13;
 bilaterally already is the different messages between the&#13;
&#13;
 drafts on openness to trade and the consequences for&#13;
&#13;
 developing countries.     While we, of course, support&#13;
&#13;
 openness to trade, we hope the present presentation does&#13;
&#13;
 justice to the material, and in particular if you compare&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph 4.36 in the new draft and paragraph 8.20 in the&#13;
&#13;
 old one, the change is significant.&#13;
&#13;
             On Chapter 5, the report and also the&#13;
&#13;
 presentation of Nora Lustig justified attention to&#13;
&#13;
 inequality as an obstacle to the proper distribution of&#13;
&#13;
 growth.   But how to tackle these equalities is stated&#13;
&#13;
 very well in Chapter 5 in principle but in practice it&#13;
&#13;
 remains a little vague and relies too much perhaps on&#13;
&#13;
 social policies.     I was referred to studies by White and&#13;
&#13;
 Anderson and also by Guo Li which could provide further&#13;
&#13;
 material.    A discussion of successful cases of&#13;
&#13;
 redistribution would also add value.&#13;
&#13;
             On the potentially damaging effects of cost&#13;
&#13;
 recovery, which several other speakers have already&#13;
&#13;
 raised, especially in primary girls' education, we hope&#13;
&#13;
 that consistency can be achieved between the text in Box&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 5.3 and Box 5.4.    That is also a point we raised&#13;
&#13;
 bilaterally.&#13;
&#13;
             One specific point which the Swiss chair also&#13;
&#13;
 raised is that we are very happy with the attention paid&#13;
&#13;
 to land reform, but the only comment is that there needs&#13;
&#13;
 to be a little more balance because the focus is very&#13;
&#13;
 much on negotiated market-based approaches, which do have&#13;
&#13;
 a good future, but there, of course, are forces outside&#13;
&#13;
 of our institution which are critical and perhaps simply&#13;
&#13;
 that balance could be reflected with a few lines.&#13;
&#13;
             On Chapter 7, I first would like to welcome&#13;
&#13;
 very much that a lot of people have focused today on&#13;
&#13;
 gender.   We welcome this and also the attention paid in&#13;
&#13;
 the document.    We felt it was underplayed at the start of&#13;
&#13;
 the WDR discussion.&#13;
&#13;
             But the specific part of the text on gender&#13;
&#13;
 comes a bit late and the main messages need to be put&#13;
&#13;
 more upfront.    I think also here it is a question of&#13;
&#13;
 reordering.    For instance, paragraph 7.75 and paragraph&#13;
&#13;
 7.72 could be moved up and reflected more strongly in the&#13;
&#13;
 overview.&#13;
&#13;
             Then, some issues which could have received&#13;
&#13;
 more attention, and, of course, that is the risk of&#13;
&#13;
 writing a comprehensive report; we will always find&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 things you didn't mention.       There was a suggestion to&#13;
&#13;
 focus more on conflict and war, which, of course, has to&#13;
&#13;
 do with the fact that millions of people on this earth&#13;
&#13;
 today are internally displaced or are refugees.      Then&#13;
&#13;
 also, commodity price risk management, HIV/AIDS, I think&#13;
&#13;
 we would support the point on family planning and&#13;
&#13;
 population growth by the Chinese chair and, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 environment which several people raised.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, as Mike Walton indicated very clearly,&#13;
&#13;
 and we would not expect anything less of him,&#13;
&#13;
 implementation is crucial.       And I feel it is very&#13;
&#13;
 important that we already take the issues in this WDR up&#13;
&#13;
 when we discuss the reviews of ESW and SSPs, since these&#13;
&#13;
 are, of course, the instruments which are vital vehicles&#13;
&#13;
 for new thinking.&#13;
&#13;
           I would once again like to thank the team.&#13;
&#13;
 Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:      Thank you, Koen.&#13;
&#13;
           Stephen Pickford, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PICKFORD:      Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Like others, let me welcome Nick to the Board&#13;
&#13;
 and look forward to seeing him on many other occasions,&#13;
&#13;
 and thanks very much to the team who have worked very&#13;
&#13;
 hard and produced what we think is an excellent document.&#13;

&#13;
           Our department in London has been very much&#13;
&#13;
 involved with the team and have been feeding our comments&#13;
&#13;
 in at various points.    So, we have relatively little to&#13;
&#13;
 add on this draft.&#13;
&#13;
           We will give some detailed comments in writing&#13;
&#13;
 to the team.   I will say a few things about the main&#13;
&#13;
 points that we would like to comment on.&#13;
&#13;
           On the central question that Nick touched on&#13;
&#13;
 about the reordering, I have to say my authorities are&#13;
&#13;
 relatively relaxed about the reorder since there is no&#13;
&#13;
 right way or wrong way it seems to us to portray this.&#13;
&#13;
 Nevertheless, what is really important is the content.&#13;
&#13;
           Nevertheless, it has created quite a storm and&#13;
&#13;
 there are a couple of suggestions we would make in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of trying to cope with that.      One is since there is a lot&#13;
&#13;
 of mistrust about what the latest draft will look like,&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps we could put this one on the web as well.     And&#13;
&#13;
 secondly, to play up in the report itself the&#13;
&#13;
 consultative process that has been followed.&#13;
&#13;
           The reality is that there has been a great deal&#13;
&#13;
 of consultation both with the poor themselves through the&#13;
&#13;
 Voices of the Poor, which in fact has been very&#13;
&#13;
 effectively deployed to influence the content and to&#13;
&#13;
 illustrate the content, and also a consultative process&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 in terms of the drafting.      The fact is that taking two&#13;
&#13;
 years to write it rather than the normal one has allowed&#13;
&#13;
 relevant research to be commissioned and to feed into the&#13;
&#13;
 process, and there has been quite a lot of discussion and&#13;
&#13;
 consultation through the Internet and other fora.&#13;
&#13;
           This is a message that I think could be&#13;
&#13;
 recorded more prominently in the report itself, because I&#13;
&#13;
 think it would actually act to diffuse some of the&#13;
&#13;
 criticism.&#13;
&#13;
           I have said already I think the three elements&#13;
&#13;
 are very well chosen and very well integrated.&#13;
&#13;
           A few niggles at the margin, if you like.&#13;
&#13;
 Firstly, like Mr. Biskup, we think the narrowness of the&#13;
&#13;
 bibliography in terms of the focuses is disappointing.&#13;
&#13;
 The focus on Anglo-American social scientists is not&#13;
&#13;
 exactly the image of the knowledge bank that I think we&#13;
&#13;
 want to project.&#13;
&#13;
           On the international development targets, we&#13;
&#13;
 like the way in which higher profile has been given to&#13;
&#13;
 the targets compared to the previous draft.         It also&#13;
&#13;
 makes the all-important link to poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategies but we still think it could perhaps be given&#13;
&#13;
 more prominence as the core of the development agenda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           On opportunity, we think the new Chapter 3 is&#13;
&#13;
 helpful and demonstrates how essential pro-poor growth&#13;
&#13;
 is.   We think the discussion could be strengthened&#13;
&#13;
 somewhat by placing it within a global context, a broad&#13;
&#13;
 context, for example, to bring out the linkages between&#13;
&#13;
 domestic trade policy, regional trading agreements and&#13;
&#13;
 the WTO itself.&#13;
&#13;
           The latest version we also think gives a much&#13;
&#13;
 more balanced approach to the role of markets and&#13;
&#13;
 economic liberalization.     Some others have criticized it,&#13;
&#13;
 but we actually think that the approach is really quite&#13;
&#13;
 well balanced now.&#13;
&#13;
           On Chapter 4, we think the main message that&#13;
&#13;
 trade openness is good for growth comes across correctly&#13;
&#13;
 and strongly, although we would like to suggest there may&#13;
&#13;
 be a little bit more put in about the links between trade&#13;
&#13;
 and poverty specifically.&#13;
&#13;
           On empowerment, we broadly welcome the new&#13;
&#13;
 Chapter 6 as well, and we think the key messages again&#13;
&#13;
 come across clearly and well.&#13;
&#13;
           On security, Chapters 7 and 8, my authorities&#13;
&#13;
 have asked me to say excellent, which is not often a word&#13;
&#13;
 we use in this Board.    However, conflict features&#13;
&#13;
 relatively little in this section, and we think it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate to give more prominence to this as one of the&#13;
&#13;
 most significant obstacles to poverty reduction in many&#13;
&#13;
 important African countries.&#13;
&#13;
           On the international dimensions, we think it is&#13;
&#13;
 entirely right that the report should address the issue&#13;
&#13;
 of global public goods and we think it covers most of the&#13;
&#13;
 key points.   It would have been nice to see more concrete&#13;
&#13;
 recommendations coming out of that.        And we also have&#13;
&#13;
 some suggestions which we will put in writing for how it&#13;
&#13;
 might slightly reorganized.&#13;
&#13;
           On debt, we felt that this draft was more&#13;
&#13;
 complacent about the Enhanced HIPC than the predecessor&#13;
&#13;
 version, which incidentally did pinpoint rather better&#13;
&#13;
 the particular problem for HIPCs coming out of conflict.&#13;
&#13;
 And we think it would be appropriate to reintroduce some&#13;
&#13;
 of those thoughts.&#13;
&#13;
           And finally, like many others, we think that&#13;
&#13;
 Chapter 11 would benefit more from stressing the need for&#13;
&#13;
 harmonization of donor procedures.        This is clearly a big&#13;
&#13;
 issue which is going to be around for some time, and has&#13;
&#13;
 been really prompted by the introduction of PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 processes, which has highlighted some of the problems&#13;
&#13;
 caused there.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            Finally, to simply echo the words of others&#13;
&#13;
 that it is now very important to work on implementation.&#13;
&#13;
 Implementation is key is a very good phrase that I would&#13;
&#13;
 echo.   The concepts in the WDR I think are very important&#13;
&#13;
 and the Bank needs to make sure that the lessons and&#13;
&#13;
 conclusions are fully implemented into its activities and&#13;
&#13;
 operations.&#13;
&#13;
            But once again, congratulations and thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. SANDSTROM:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
            Mr. Almofadhi, please.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. ALMOFADHI:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            Like others, we welcome the opportunity to&#13;
&#13;
 comment on this long awaited and very informative report&#13;
&#13;
 which addresses issues that go to the heart of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 mission.   We had a useful bilateral discussion with Ms.&#13;
&#13;
 Lustig on some specific points.       So, I will be selective&#13;
&#13;
 in my comments, especially since we have already had a&#13;
&#13;
 far-ranging discussion before lunch and colleagues have&#13;
&#13;
 already covered some of the points we wished to make.&#13;
&#13;
            My first point concerns the three areas of&#13;
&#13;
 recommended actions -- promoting opportunity,&#13;
&#13;
 facilitating empowerment and enhancing security.       The&#13;
&#13;
 draft indicates that advances in these areas are&#13;
&#13;
 complementary and there is no hierarchy in importance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 However, given the variety of levels of development in&#13;
&#13;
 different countries, there may be a need for some&#13;
&#13;
 prioritization in the individual country context.       I&#13;
&#13;
 think this point has been made during this morning's&#13;
&#13;
 discussion by a number of speakers.&#13;
&#13;
            I will return later to the broader issue of&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, although I would emphasize there is much to&#13;
&#13;
 agree with in the draft regarding promoting opportunity&#13;
&#13;
 and enhancing security.&#13;
&#13;
            A second separate point is to note that the&#13;
&#13;
 chart on page 7 of the overview makes it clear that only&#13;
&#13;
 in East Asia and the Middle East has poverty been&#13;
&#13;
 falling.   I think the report might further clarify the&#13;
&#13;
 reasons for such success in these two regions.        Perhaps&#13;
&#13;
 an additional box would be helpful in this area.&#13;
&#13;
            A third point going forward concerns the&#13;
&#13;
 implications of the report for involving the strategy of&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank itself in this area.        Here I am mindful that the&#13;
&#13;
 recent OED report evaluating the effectiveness of the&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank's existing poverty reduction strategy made two&#13;
&#13;
 basic criticisms.     The first one is the Bank has found it&#13;
&#13;
 difficult to operationalize broad-based growth, and the&#13;
&#13;
 second one says that the Bank's implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 strategy was insufficiently focused on measuring and&#13;
&#13;
 monitoring results linked to Bank's assistance.&#13;
&#13;
           We must all consider these issues as the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 moves ahead for the WDR to look at its own policies.&#13;
&#13;
           As a fourth and final point, I would like to&#13;
&#13;
 comment on the relationship of some of the language of&#13;
&#13;
 the report to the Bank's non-political mandate.       Here, I&#13;
&#13;
 associate myself with the reservation expressed by many&#13;
&#13;
 speakers this morning, including those representing&#13;
&#13;
 important borrowing countries who cited a number of&#13;
&#13;
 relevant examples.&#13;
&#13;
           The same comment might be made of the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion of political regimes in Chapter 6.        Indeed,&#13;
&#13;
 the whole issue of empowerment seems a little unclear in&#13;
&#13;
 the report.   Empowerment of some might imply&#13;
&#13;
 disempowerment of others, which gets us to the heart of&#13;
&#13;
 political issues.     They are no doubt interesting but we&#13;
&#13;
 continue to have doubts as to the appropriateness of the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank taking up this issue.&#13;
&#13;
           I listened carefully to what Mr. Stern said&#13;
&#13;
 before lunch about focusing on what I might call micro&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment and avoiding the big political issues that&#13;
&#13;
 involve political parties.       However, as someone once&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 said, all politics are local and political issues&#13;
&#13;
 involving the poor are no exception in my opinion.&#13;
&#13;
             For the reasons stated by the Brazilian and the&#13;
&#13;
 Chinese chairs, amongst others, the Bank has to be&#13;
&#13;
 careful in these areas, not least because of possible&#13;
&#13;
 reputational risk.       And despite Mr. Stern's reassurances,&#13;
&#13;
 I still have reservations about the use of indicators&#13;
&#13;
 which assess what many regard as political issues.&#13;
&#13;
 Again, the issues of the Bank's mandate and reputational&#13;
&#13;
 risk arises also.&#13;
&#13;
             All in all, I guess these examples are part of&#13;
&#13;
 a larger trend of what many are seeing as an increased&#13;
&#13;
 politicization of the Bank, a matter that is of concern&#13;
&#13;
 to my authorities and on which they will no doubt express&#13;
&#13;
 their views in due course.&#13;
&#13;
             In conclusion, returning to the report before&#13;
&#13;
 us, we found this on balance to be a rich and interesting&#13;
&#13;
 staff report.    We hope it will contribute to the ongoing&#13;
&#13;
 public debate and the formulation of the Bank's own&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             The close attention given to the draft today&#13;
&#13;
 demonstrates the importance of these issues.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;

&#13;
            Haneed Sayed, please.&#13;
&#13;
            MS. SAYED:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            Like others, we want to congratulate everyone&#13;
&#13;
 on the team for such a thorough and extensive report.&#13;
&#13;
 The production of any WDR is a challenge and this one&#13;
&#13;
 clearly must have been a very challenging experience,&#13;
&#13;
 given the fundamental nature of the subject.        So, we&#13;
&#13;
 commend everyone who was involved in this.&#13;
&#13;
            This WDR does two things:       first, it reviews&#13;
&#13;
 experience of the past decade in poverty alleviation; and&#13;
&#13;
 secondly, it sets out or should set out the direction for&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank in the next ten years.       It has taken a very&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive view of poverty, one which we support,&#13;
&#13;
 which encompasses economic, social, cultural,&#13;
&#13;
 institutional and political, the public, privatize and&#13;
&#13;
 then on the other side of three dimensional matrix, if&#13;
&#13;
 you will, the global, national and the local.&#13;
&#13;
            So, immediately we realize the level of&#13;
&#13;
 complexity here but this, of course, is not a criticism.&#13;
&#13;
 I think this report will be debated for years.        There is&#13;
&#13;
 something here for everyone probably, whichever side you&#13;
&#13;
 come on.&#13;
&#13;
            But this complexity I think was probably --&#13;
&#13;
 even though I was not around -- was probably debated in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the 1990 WDR, even before that.       The issue always comes&#13;
&#13;
 down to what are you going to do about it and how will&#13;
&#13;
 you address these and then, more specifically, what the&#13;
&#13;
 role of the Bank would be.&#13;
&#13;
           We do feel that there needs to be more guidance&#13;
&#13;
 on how to prioritize the poverty reduction activities.&#13;
&#13;
 We take the point that Nora made at the beginning that&#13;
&#13;
 this was done on purpose because prioritization has to&#13;
&#13;
 happen on the country level and we agree with that.         But&#13;
&#13;
 I think that impression will still be seen when people&#13;
&#13;
 read the WDR.&#13;
&#13;
           And we certainly look forward to the&#13;
&#13;
 operational note and the implementation work that will be&#13;
&#13;
 done.&#13;
&#13;
           On the subject of Chapter 3 in terms of growth&#13;
&#13;
 and redistribution, we think that the chapter comes out&#13;
&#13;
 in the right kind of balance.      Certainly, growth is&#13;
&#13;
 important and there is a lot of that.         But also, as Mike&#13;
&#13;
 Walton mentioned in the beginning, it is also stressing&#13;
&#13;
 that redistribution is important.&#13;
&#13;
           And Box 3.7 which says that redistribution need&#13;
&#13;
 not compromise efficiency and growth is something we were&#13;
&#13;
 happy to read, that there could be such a win/win&#13;
&#13;
 situation.   I think the question here is:         How do you&#13;

                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 ensure that redistribution does not compromise efficiency&#13;
&#13;
 and growth?   I think more guidance in the report on this&#13;
&#13;
 would be helpful.&#13;
&#13;
            On Chapter 4 about the well-functioning markets&#13;
&#13;
 and the fact that they do create opportunities for the&#13;
&#13;
 poor to escape poverty, but it also says that too often&#13;
&#13;
 market reforms fail entirely or have unintended&#13;
&#13;
 consequences for the poor, again we find this message to&#13;
&#13;
 be balanced and realistic.       But we are somewhat&#13;
&#13;
 disappointed that the chapter does not address more&#13;
&#13;
 deeply the issues of the sequencing of reforms.        It does&#13;
&#13;
 point to it along with the need to support institutions&#13;
&#13;
 and how political motives come into play to derail&#13;
&#13;
 reforms.   But I think the issue of sequencing is&#13;
&#13;
 something the Bank has been struggling with for some&#13;
&#13;
 time, and this is just very superficially touched upon in&#13;
&#13;
 the current draft.&#13;
&#13;
            On the issue of empowerment, we do think that&#13;
&#13;
 is an important element in poverty reduction.        There are&#13;
&#13;
 many elements there, as Mr. Stern has pointed to, on&#13;
&#13;
 participation, on corruption, governance, institutional&#13;
&#13;
 issues, and these are all clearly very important.        I&#13;
&#13;
 think the trouble that we have and others have pointed to&#13;
&#13;
 is more on passing judgment on the nature of political&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 regimes.    This is basically the last bit of Chapter 6&#13;
&#13;
 which we feel may have strayed a bit far.&#13;
&#13;
             Again, it is not because of what is being said&#13;
&#13;
 there and that democratic politics may not foster stable&#13;
&#13;
 environments for growth.      But our question is:       What will&#13;
&#13;
 this imply for the Bank and the kind of slippery slope&#13;
&#13;
 that this may bring the Bank to?&#13;
&#13;
             I think we must recognize that this is a risky&#13;
&#13;
 business, and staff are already becoming more risk averse&#13;
&#13;
 in the aftermath of projects like the experience of the&#13;
&#13;
 China Western Poverty Project and others.           So, we remain&#13;
&#13;
 to be convinced how such endeavors could play out within&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
             We welcome the discussion in Chapter 10 on&#13;
&#13;
 giving voice to poor people in the global fora and the&#13;
&#13;
 call for mechanisms to ensure that developing countries&#13;
&#13;
 contribute more forcefully to global decisions.&#13;
&#13;
             On investing in measurement and monitoring,&#13;
&#13;
 again we also think that is very important and that is&#13;
&#13;
 discussed briefly in the report.        It is a little&#13;
&#13;
 dismaying to read that it took twenty years to cover 86&#13;
&#13;
 percent of the world's people via two household income&#13;
&#13;
 expenditure surveys and on the health and education&#13;
&#13;
 indicators, obviously we are still lagging a lot on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 quality and so on.   We think this is absolutely&#13;
&#13;
 fundamental and for our region, the MENA Region, not&#13;
&#13;
 enough has been done in this area.        And we absolutely&#13;
&#13;
 encourage and would be happy to work in any way we can to&#13;
&#13;
 push this agenda further.&#13;
&#13;
            But it also makes us think that if we don't&#13;
&#13;
 have the economic, health and education indicators, how&#13;
&#13;
 are we going to get those indicators on vulnerability and&#13;
&#13;
 voicelessness and powerlessness which are going to be&#13;
&#13;
 much harder?&#13;
&#13;
            A few words on the MENA Region.         My Saudi&#13;
&#13;
 colleague has already actually said the main point.            MENA&#13;
&#13;
 stands out as the region with the lowest poverty of all&#13;
&#13;
 the regions, and along with East Asia the only other one&#13;
&#13;
 where poverty has declined between 1987 and 1998.             So, it&#13;
&#13;
 begs the question of what has brought this and how does&#13;
&#13;
 this fit with the three pillars posed in the report.&#13;
&#13;
            In fact, there is a paragraph on Jordan which&#13;
&#13;
 says that there was negative GDP growth, yet there was&#13;
&#13;
 reduction in poverty.    So, are there some specific&#13;
&#13;
 lessons there to be drawn from MENA?&#13;
&#13;
            Finally, about the process of the WDR, this&#13;
&#13;
 clearly was a first, particularly in the consultation&#13;
&#13;
 process.   For two years the whole world in a sense was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 debating the issues in this report.         And we would like to&#13;
&#13;
 hear more from the team about what worked and what did&#13;
&#13;
 not.   And this is not about the Ravi Kanbur issue.        Much&#13;
&#13;
 larger for the next WDR is what do you recommend as the&#13;
&#13;
 things to do and not to do?&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Boris Lvin, please.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. LVIN:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             Being so late, I can skip my formal statement&#13;
&#13;
 and safe this nice sounding voice for the Prague&#13;
&#13;
 meetings.&#13;
&#13;
             I just want to congratulate the staff with this&#13;
&#13;
 huge achievement, this unusual report which is so broad,&#13;
&#13;
 so over-arching.    I think we are now too close to&#13;
&#13;
 evaluate its achievements and particularly weaknesses.&#13;
&#13;
 So, probably after a few years, we can see it in the&#13;
&#13;
 proper light.&#13;
&#13;
             So far, I think in our next exercises, it would&#13;
&#13;
 be better to have more focused, more compact, more&#13;
&#13;
 sector-oriented reports which convey probably deeper&#13;
&#13;
 knowledge in a narrow setting.&#13;
&#13;
             So far, in the report before us, I am afraid&#13;
&#13;
 almost every assertion is accompanied by a softening&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 qualification, which often dilutes the main message.             So,&#13;
&#13;
 as many said, too many things for all and every reader in&#13;
&#13;
 this report.&#13;
&#13;
           It is now a bit fashionable to speak sort of&#13;
&#13;
 despairingly to speak about the so-called Washington&#13;
&#13;
 consensus.     And we seem to move from solid and measurable&#13;
&#13;
 concepts developed within the framework of this&#13;
&#13;
 consensus, which is probably quite wrongly called this&#13;
&#13;
 way, toward vague notions of institutions and governance&#13;
&#13;
 which are probably easy to discuss but very hard to&#13;
&#13;
 measure and independently evaluate.&#13;
&#13;
           It looks as though the objectives of the&#13;
&#13;
 Washington consensus already achieved and desired&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes failed to materialize, which is not the case.&#13;
&#13;
 That is why we are somewhat concerned about extensive&#13;
&#13;
 discussions of the concept of empowerment, which is quite&#13;
&#13;
 murky, and there are as many understandings of this&#13;
&#13;
 notion as there are reticent speakers in this auditorium.&#13;
&#13;
           And obviously, it is probably better to talk&#13;
&#13;
 about liberation, freeing up of poor, as is demonstrated&#13;
&#13;
 in the statement of Mr. Garcia.         And if we talk about&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, there are inevitably some incursions in the&#13;
&#13;
 area of political and governance issues.             And I can only&#13;
&#13;
 join other speakers which expressed their concerns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            And I can add one more dimension to this&#13;
&#13;
 concern.   Besides the fact that it is very close to be&#13;
&#13;
 beyond our mandate, it is not clear both from this&#13;
&#13;
 document and from the other valuable research that&#13;
&#13;
 political developments in terms of democratization and so&#13;
&#13;
 on can and may in fact assist in poverty eradication and&#13;
&#13;
 development.&#13;
&#13;
            We have some correlations but it is not clear&#13;
&#13;
 where the causality is, and probably it is either weak or&#13;
&#13;
 a reversed one.   Probably when development reaches an&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate level, some political developments may be&#13;
&#13;
 ripe or otherwise that maybe pushing for them may be&#13;
&#13;
 counterproductive.   And this issue is not addressed in&#13;
&#13;
 the document.&#13;
&#13;
            Some people talked about equity and poverty.&#13;
&#13;
 It seems that we must be concerned more about absolute&#13;
&#13;
 poverty not about relative poverty.        In this aspect,&#13;
&#13;
 redistribution looks probably more like sort of a luxury&#13;
&#13;
 which some affluent nations can afford rather than a&#13;
&#13;
 necessary factor of development in poverty eradication.&#13;
&#13;
            Historical analysis will show that those&#13;
&#13;
 nations which are now rich achieved their wealth during a&#13;
&#13;
 period of very low redistribution and began&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 redistributing only after they became affluent and not&#13;
&#13;
 the other way around.&#13;
&#13;
           I was somewhat surprised to see issues of land&#13;
&#13;
 reform discussed in this document because I think it is&#13;
&#13;
 not entirely a correct issue to discuss.            I think in a&#13;
&#13;
 sense there are no successful or unsuccessful land&#13;
&#13;
 reforms at all.    All successful land reforms are sort of&#13;
&#13;
 by-products of successful urbanization and industrial&#13;
&#13;
 development.   There is no such thing as modern affluent&#13;
&#13;
 society based entirely on agriculture and densely&#13;
&#13;
 populated agricultural territory.         And our focus should&#13;
&#13;
 be on industry, on urban areas, and not on&#13;
&#13;
 redistribution, existing land within existing population.&#13;
&#13;
 It doesn't look to be a correct answer to agricultural&#13;
&#13;
 over-population.&#13;
&#13;
           One issue of concern is constant embellishment&#13;
&#13;
 of the report with Voices of the Poor.          It may sound&#13;
&#13;
 descending, but I must confess that I found in these&#13;
&#13;
 quotations, numerous quotations nothing new for me.            I&#13;
&#13;
 grew up in a relatively affluent society and still&#13;
&#13;
 everything which poorer people said in these quotations&#13;
&#13;
 is well known from the literature.         So, I am afraid in&#13;
&#13;
 seemingly worshipping the poor, extensively quoting them&#13;
&#13;
 and describing some unique knowledge to them, we, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 fact, assume and promote sort of paternalistic approach&#13;
&#13;
 which should be avoided.&#13;
&#13;
           I think our main message -- probably not&#13;
&#13;
 everybody will agree with this -- should be not&#13;
&#13;
 empowering the poor, not learning from the poor but&#13;
&#13;
 liberating the poor and creating opportunities for them&#13;
&#13;
 to become rich.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           We may be at the name list on my list, Emmanuel&#13;
&#13;
 Moulin, who will wrap it all up.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MOULIN:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Actually, in preparing my statement, I felt it&#13;
&#13;
 might exceed six minutes.      So, during the long day I had&#13;
&#13;
 plenty of time to cut some parts with some enthusiasm&#13;
&#13;
 that if I speak fast enough, I might even reach this&#13;
&#13;
 idealistic goal.&#13;
&#13;
           France, as a member of the Board as well as a&#13;
&#13;
 bilateral donor, has already stated on several occasions&#13;
&#13;
 that we very much welcome and support the WDR 2000/01 at&#13;
&#13;
 each stage of its development.        We did so last September&#13;
&#13;
 when the Board discussed the approach and outline of the&#13;
&#13;
 report in an informal meeting chaired by Joe Stiglitz,&#13;
&#13;
 again in December when the WDR team presented the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 contours of this WDR, and finally in February at a&#13;
&#13;
 seminar we held in Paris where Ravi Kanbur presented the&#13;
&#13;
 first draft of the report to an audience composed not&#13;
&#13;
 only of French officials but NGOs and academics.&#13;
&#13;
            That meeting in Paris closed on a note of&#13;
&#13;
 strong and general support for the shift or at least the&#13;
&#13;
 clear evolution of the World Bank's thoughts on&#13;
&#13;
 development as reflected by the draft report.&#13;
&#13;
            Once again, we have to take a stand on the WDR&#13;
&#13;
 2000/01.   We now have before us the new draft, which is&#13;
&#13;
 likely to become the final version, but this report&#13;
&#13;
 should be seen in context and we want to be consistent in&#13;
&#13;
 substance with our previous statements.&#13;
&#13;
            Had nothing transpired between the previous&#13;
&#13;
 draft and this presentation, it would have been very easy&#13;
&#13;
 for us to confirm our prior opinion and stop the&#13;
&#13;
 statement here.   But we had some hesitation for, as&#13;
&#13;
 everyone knows, between this draft and the previous one,&#13;
&#13;
 when the Director of WDR resigned.        We surmised that he&#13;
&#13;
 had serious reasons to make such a decision.         The press&#13;
&#13;
 gave all kinds of explanations for it.&#13;
&#13;
            And, at the same time, we are told both by&#13;
&#13;
 management and the rest of the WDR team that nothing has&#13;
&#13;
 substantially changed in the report.         It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 understandable that observers may be puzzled or even&#13;
&#13;
 suspicious when confronted with such a situation.&#13;
&#13;
           So in order to form our opinion, we had two&#13;
&#13;
 questions which we needed to address.         What has changed&#13;
&#13;
 in this draft WDR compared to the first one?         Is this&#13;
&#13;
 second draft true to the main messages of the previous&#13;
&#13;
 one?&#13;
&#13;
           After comparing this version to the January one&#13;
&#13;
 and, most of all, having very fruitful meetings with Nora&#13;
&#13;
 Lustig and her team, we have arrived at the conclusion&#13;
&#13;
 that notwithstanding a few more specific comments, on&#13;
&#13;
 which I will get back to later, we can give our full&#13;
&#13;
 support to the draft submitted to us today.&#13;
&#13;
           In particular, we confirm with other speakers&#13;
&#13;
 our strong interest in the three pillar approach to&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction.   We understood that the order of&#13;
&#13;
 presentation of the three themes is the only change here,&#13;
&#13;
 a sort of cosmetic one.    We appreciate that the report&#13;
&#13;
 preserved the position that empowerment, security and&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity are equally important for success in fighting&#13;
&#13;
 poverty, as was constantly stated in the outline and the&#13;
&#13;
 first draft.&#13;
&#13;
           We welcome the comprehensive first chapter on&#13;
&#13;
 the evolution of poverty and we are deeply concerned by&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the evolution of poverty in Africa, which justifies&#13;
&#13;
 making this continent the Bank's main priority.           We&#13;
&#13;
 understand that more emphasis has been put on the link&#13;
&#13;
 between growth and poverty reduction, taking into account&#13;
&#13;
 the conclusions of recent works on that subject.            Yet, we&#13;
&#13;
 believe that the underlying conditions in terms of human,&#13;
&#13;
 natural, financial and social assets, political&#13;
&#13;
 structures and the structure of inequities are important&#13;
&#13;
 in trying to explain poverty, and this constitutes one of&#13;
&#13;
 the major break-throughs of this WDR.&#13;
&#13;
           We welcome the analysis on institution,&#13;
&#13;
 particularly in order to promote good governance, which&#13;
&#13;
 as we know is part of fighting poverty.            As we already&#13;
&#13;
 said during our bilateral meeting with the team and as&#13;
&#13;
 already stated in several written statements, we would&#13;
&#13;
 have appreciated more emphasis on the issue of tax reform&#13;
&#13;
 and on its impact on poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           Regarding the theme of reforms, we acknowledge&#13;
&#13;
 that the stance is more balanced in this draft, showing&#13;
&#13;
 that reforms can do a lot for both growth and poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction if the institution framework and the political&#13;
&#13;
 economy of the reforms are adequately taken into account.&#13;
&#13;
           There are winners and losers in reform designs&#13;
&#13;
 and processes.   Public action is necessary to protect the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 interest and well-being of the poor and those who could&#13;
&#13;
 become poor.&#13;
&#13;
             We welcome Chapter 10 on global actions to&#13;
&#13;
 promote the three pillars.      We believe that more emphasis&#13;
&#13;
 could have been put on the need for international rules&#13;
&#13;
 to support these global actions, particularly to tackle&#13;
&#13;
 what Larry Summers called the dark side of capital&#13;
&#13;
 mobility and on the environment.&#13;
&#13;
             On trade, we fully support the comments made on&#13;
&#13;
 the need to open wealthy country markets to exports from&#13;
&#13;
 developing countries.     The renewed Lome Convention builds&#13;
&#13;
 towards this direction.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, we are convinced that we should think&#13;
&#13;
 further about the incentives we could create perhaps in&#13;
&#13;
 our pricing policy to make client countries focus even&#13;
&#13;
 more strongly on poverty based on the work already&#13;
&#13;
 advanced in this WDR.&#13;
&#13;
             In this context, we feel that this version of&#13;
&#13;
 the WDR remains substantially consistent to the previous&#13;
&#13;
 one and still reflects what some have called the new&#13;
&#13;
 paradigm.    However, we must be aware that others,&#13;
&#13;
 especially outside the Bank, may feel some distress&#13;
&#13;
 towards our institution.      It would be a pity if this&#13;
&#13;
 crucial report had become so popular even before being&#13;

&#13;
 finalized.   We are now under suspicion as symbolizing any&#13;
&#13;
 conservatism inside and outside the Bank.          This could&#13;
&#13;
 undermine all that management together with the Board&#13;
&#13;
 have tried to achieve in the last two years in their&#13;
&#13;
 fight against poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           We must step up to the doubts that have been&#13;
&#13;
 raised in the general public.      Therefore, it seems to us&#13;
&#13;
 that the dissemination of the WDR 2000/01 must be&#13;
&#13;
 accompanied by a special and candid communication effort&#13;
&#13;
 aimed at reconciling the Bank with those who might still&#13;
&#13;
 be concerned by what they read in the news last month.&#13;
&#13;
           And I want to thank Nick Stern for his very&#13;
&#13;
 detailed presentation of what happened last month in his&#13;
&#13;
 initial intervention.&#13;
&#13;
           In our view, the WDR team should participate in&#13;
&#13;
 both the design and the execution of this effort.&#13;
&#13;
 Moreover, we think that the best advocates of the WDR&#13;
&#13;
 would be independent and critical observers who are not&#13;
&#13;
 subject to suspicion, namely certain well-known NGOs and&#13;
&#13;
 academics.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you very much.&#13;

&#13;
           Your last point on dissemination goes back to&#13;
&#13;
 Anna's question earlier also.      The team will come back to&#13;
&#13;
 that.&#13;
&#13;
           Jan.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:   Actually, Mr. Moulin has just made&#13;
&#13;
 much of the intervention that I wanted to make.     It is&#13;
&#13;
 looking beyond to this point about dissemination.     But&#13;
&#13;
 let me link it to a point that Anna Brandt made in her&#13;
&#13;
 point that we have a modest turning in development&#13;
&#13;
 assistance figures and on this point of aid fatigue, I&#13;
&#13;
 wanted to agree with her.     Let's not create a self-&#13;
&#13;
 fulfilling prophecy and let's not underestimate the&#13;
&#13;
 capacity that a WDR like this strategically leveraged&#13;
&#13;
 through discussion and broad translation and&#13;
&#13;
 dissemination can have in reversing those aid flow&#13;
&#13;
 trends.&#13;
&#13;
           I know it won't do it in and of itself, but&#13;
&#13;
 there is a great deal here which is tremendously eloquent&#13;
&#13;
 and which makes a powerful case for why the international&#13;
&#13;
 community has a strong self-interest and stake in&#13;
&#13;
 investing to reduce poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I do think that a very well-designed&#13;
&#13;
 communications strategy to overcome the issue of what&#13;
&#13;
 changes there may be and to refocus this on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 tremendous substance in this report as a call to action&#13;
&#13;
 for all of us globally is tremendously important.&#13;
&#13;
           And I wanted to ask just two process questions.&#13;
&#13;
 One, we are in a formal Board meeting, but, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 this is a research product that is not formally approved&#13;
&#13;
 by the Board.   So, I just wanted to sort of ask the&#13;
&#13;
 question of why we do this in a formal session.&#13;
&#13;
           And then, to reflect that for the future, as we&#13;
&#13;
 end this discussion, I wonder if we might not want to&#13;
&#13;
 think about organizing such discussion where a range of&#13;
&#13;
 views exist on the Board around key points.          As I have&#13;
&#13;
 listened to all the interventions there were clusters of&#13;
&#13;
 topics, for example, about the pillars, about&#13;
&#13;
 decentralization, about participation, and just for the&#13;
&#13;
 future I wonder if we might be having a more cogent&#13;
&#13;
 discussion if we could organize it along those lines so&#13;
&#13;
 we could hear in greater juxtaposition the diversity of&#13;
&#13;
 views among us as a group.     But that is a small process&#13;
&#13;
 point.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we all agree that there may be more&#13;
&#13;
 effective ways of having this discussion.          Some have&#13;
&#13;
 suggested that we might want to consider circulating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 notes or statements in an e-mail and then try to pull out&#13;
&#13;
 the major themes and then have a discussion.          I don't&#13;
&#13;
 know if we should think about that for similar occasions&#13;
&#13;
 in the future.&#13;
&#13;
           The idea with the written statements was&#13;
&#13;
 similar but they become rather formal.          So, maybe there&#13;
&#13;
 is a way of getting around this.&#13;
&#13;
           But let's think about that later.         First, we&#13;
&#13;
 have to finalize this WDR.&#13;
&#13;
           Are there any other comments at this stage?&#13;
&#13;
           Jaime.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. ALVAREZ:     If I may, Mr. Chairman, off the&#13;
&#13;
 record, I was given instruction to speak off the record.&#13;
&#13;
 It was only ten years ago that we were talking about the&#13;
&#13;
 Washington consensus being the right way to go.         Today we&#13;
&#13;
 are before a document full of doubts about the markets.&#13;
&#13;
 We need a better filter to define what needs to be the&#13;
&#13;
 true development agenda.      We are convinced that the&#13;
&#13;
 intellectual battle has been won.&#13;
&#13;
           So, if the intellectual battle is over, it is&#13;
&#13;
 time for the poor to empower themselves, the prescription&#13;
&#13;
 in the document, and win the political battle around this&#13;
&#13;
 table.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           The voices of the poor around this table are&#13;
&#13;
 not being listened to.     Maybe it is because we need&#13;
&#13;
 affirmative action.    That is the only solution on the&#13;
&#13;
 topic of minorities, gender, race, et cetera gives us.&#13;
&#13;
           The way in which the frustration was put to us&#13;
&#13;
 is that we are not a sack, we are not a punching bag.&#13;
&#13;
 Every time there is a political swing, which seems to be&#13;
&#13;
 moving the target, as our Russian colleague has said, the&#13;
&#13;
 results of the reform process hasn't been given the time&#13;
&#13;
 to mature and to show what the results may be.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Should we turn back to the team for the final&#13;
&#13;
 round?   We will start with Nick.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STERN:   Let me thank you again for the very&#13;
&#13;
 rich comments that you have given us and that will be&#13;
&#13;
 very valuable guidance in the last hectic few days before&#13;
&#13;
 the report has to go to the printer.         But we have got&#13;
&#13;
 some time and we will do our best to do justice to the&#13;
&#13;
 comments that have been made.&#13;
&#13;
           They will certainly reflect -- because a lot of&#13;
&#13;
 them were about strategic approaches to the report --&#13;
&#13;
 they will certainly reflect the way in which we present&#13;
&#13;
 it and the dissemination process, as well as this report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 that affects the process and the written word of the next&#13;
&#13;
 report which is, of course, about institutions and where&#13;
&#13;
 we will be trying to get to grips more specifically with&#13;
&#13;
 some of the difficulties of that idea.&#13;
&#13;
            It is a difficult idea but it is a very&#13;
&#13;
 important idea, and some of the comments that you have&#13;
&#13;
 given us today I think will feed directly into that&#13;
&#13;
 report too.&#13;
&#13;
            So, I hope your remarks today will have many&#13;
&#13;
 what the economists call joint products, we will have&#13;
&#13;
 many different kinds of products beyond the immediate of&#13;
&#13;
 influencing the written word of this report.        So, thank&#13;
&#13;
 you very much on behalf of us all for all those comments.&#13;
&#13;
            It is very encouraging to me right at the&#13;
&#13;
 beginning to see how seriously you take a document which&#13;
&#13;
 we take very seriously.     And that is a great source of&#13;
&#13;
 encouragement to us.&#13;
&#13;
            Now I will go very quickly through some points&#13;
&#13;
 and then Nora and Mike will take up things which I leave&#13;
&#13;
 out.&#13;
&#13;
            We take very strongly the notion that the&#13;
&#13;
 overview needs special attention, and it is a long report&#13;
&#13;
 and it is vital that we get that right and punchy and so&#13;
&#13;
 on.    So, we will indeed pay special attention to that.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Secondly, there were a number of issues on data&#13;
&#13;
 and disaggregation and also in relation to Voices of the&#13;
&#13;
 Poor.   That is something which I think is very important&#13;
&#13;
 going forward.   I have worked on detailed micro data for&#13;
&#13;
 the best part of my adult life, and it is expensive to&#13;
&#13;
 collect, but it is very important to do it.          And I think&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank's record on this in the past has been very good,&#13;
&#13;
 particularly, for example, in the living standards&#13;
&#13;
 measurement study, the LSMS.      The Bank has led the charge&#13;
&#13;
 on many of these issues, and I think it has to go on&#13;
&#13;
 leading the charge.&#13;
&#13;
           You can have very good household data set of a&#13;
&#13;
 size of a few thousand, say, 5,000 or 10,000; you can get&#13;
&#13;
 lots of information out of a data set that size.             But as&#13;
&#13;
 soon as you start disaggregating by region, urban and&#13;
&#13;
 rural, then that 5,000 -- if you have got five regions in&#13;
&#13;
 urban and rural, that 5,000 becomes 500.           And from a data&#13;
&#13;
 set of 500, it is very difficult to say much that is&#13;
&#13;
 solid on distribution.&#13;
&#13;
           So, this is an expensive, technical, very&#13;
&#13;
 important area which we have to think carefully about.&#13;
&#13;
 There are very real problems about consistency between&#13;
&#13;
 household data and national income data.           That is&#13;
&#13;
 particularly true of a country whose data I know quite&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 well, which is the data for India.        And India's data are&#13;
&#13;
 pretty good.   If they have got problems, I suspect they&#13;
&#13;
 are deeper elsewhere, even deeper elsewhere, although&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps less deep in other places.&#13;
&#13;
           So, those areas of consistency are very&#13;
&#13;
 important to feeling that we are on secure ground and&#13;
&#13;
 knowing where we are.    Now we have to use the data we&#13;
&#13;
 have got, and we have tried to use it with judgment and&#13;
&#13;
 care.   And we have to say where we stand now, and that is&#13;
&#13;
 what the report tries to do.&#13;
&#13;
           But one has to remember the complications of&#13;
&#13;
 these data issues.   And it is international institutions&#13;
&#13;
 like this that have a special responsibility in making&#13;
&#13;
 sure that information is as good as it can be and that we&#13;
&#13;
 are in the intellectual and practical lead on the issues.&#13;
&#13;
 So, I welcome very much those comments.&#13;
&#13;
           One or two people said that the Voices of the&#13;
&#13;
 Poor actually reflect what you might have heard from the&#13;
&#13;
 not so poor.   I think that is actually right.      When we&#13;
&#13;
 talk about what well-being means, we are also talking&#13;
&#13;
 about what poverty means.     It means being deprived or&#13;
&#13;
 doing badly relative to our criteria of well-being.       So,&#13;
&#13;
 I think it is good that there is some natural&#13;
&#13;
 understanding in terms of experience of the voices of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 poor.   Poverty is the absence or the low achievement on&#13;
&#13;
 the dimensions which we think of as well-being.             So that&#13;
&#13;
 part of the thing I think is natural.&#13;
&#13;
           On conflict, I think we have to have another&#13;
&#13;
 look to what we can say on that.         Obviously, conflict is&#13;
&#13;
 devastating to standards of living, a fundamental cause&#13;
&#13;
 of poverty.    I think the report does reflect it but we&#13;
&#13;
 can go back and see whether we can reflect it a little&#13;
&#13;
 more strongly.&#13;
&#13;
           Now on the political statement, here I had a&#13;
&#13;
 slightly funny experience because the political&#13;
&#13;
 counselors at the EBRD were in my department as the Chief&#13;
&#13;
 Economist, and I was often chastised for not saying&#13;
&#13;
 enough about politics.      Now I have come here and you&#13;
&#13;
 start to get something of the opposite.              It was a&#13;
&#13;
 poignant experience from that point of view.&#13;
&#13;
           If you ask about how we are trying to respond&#13;
&#13;
 to the very important insight that -- and I say this as a&#13;
&#13;
 card-carrying economist -- that other social sciences&#13;
&#13;
 have a great deal to contribute to the understanding of&#13;
&#13;
 development, I believe that sincerely, then you have to&#13;
&#13;
 get into them.     And you have to get into them in a&#13;
&#13;
 serious way.     Political science is one of the very&#13;
&#13;
 important aspects of trying to understand development.&#13;

&#13;
 So is anthropology which is reflected here, law which is&#13;
&#13;
 also reflected here and others also.&#13;
&#13;
           When you get into them, you have to try to be&#13;
&#13;
 analytical and sometimes, where it is appropriate,&#13;
&#13;
 quantitative.   There are hazards in doing that, but they&#13;
&#13;
 are hazards which are intrinsic to that approach.&#13;
&#13;
           Now that doesn't mean that we are careless or&#13;
&#13;
 we accept any old hazards.       It just means that we have to&#13;
&#13;
 embark on this, but we have to do it with care, and we&#13;
&#13;
 owe you the obligation to do it with care.             But I think&#13;
&#13;
 we have to do it.&#13;
&#13;
           But we will again go back over it to see&#13;
&#13;
 whether we have discharged our responsibility to embark&#13;
&#13;
 on these non-economic aspects with care.             And so, we will&#13;
&#13;
 check very carefully on that side.&#13;
&#13;
           The process of consultation many people&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned, and I can say this as an outsider looking at&#13;
&#13;
 the people for whom I have some fondness who are working&#13;
&#13;
 on the WDR, it is the very heavy price that is paid for&#13;
&#13;
 that process of consultation in terms of the way in which&#13;
&#13;
 you do your work.     If somebody was standing over your&#13;
&#13;
 shoulder every time you revised a paragraph on your word&#13;
&#13;
 processor, you would find life very difficult.             That&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 doesn't mean that we don't do it; we have to do it, and&#13;
&#13;
 it is a tremendous achievement how far that is gone.&#13;
&#13;
           But we are going to have to look very carefully&#13;
&#13;
 as to how you do that, not with any reduction of&#13;
&#13;
 enthusiasm but with some care in trying to understand how&#13;
&#13;
 best to do what is an essential process, bearing in mind&#13;
&#13;
 the cost to actually producing the WDR with live people&#13;
&#13;
 at the end of that process.&#13;
&#13;
           I congratulate them on many things, but not the&#13;
&#13;
 least on their survival in all of this.&#13;
&#13;
           Now the last thing I want to say -- I will&#13;
&#13;
 leave implementation as before to Mike -- the process of&#13;
&#13;
 dissemination, which is indeed extremely important and&#13;
&#13;
 there are opportunities, of course, electronically now&#13;
&#13;
 which we didn't have before.      But that is not a total&#13;
&#13;
 substitute for face-to-face discussion with people.&#13;
&#13;
           In that process of consultation, as was&#13;
&#13;
 emphasized at the very end, there will be people with&#13;
&#13;
 their magnifying glass trying to identify the differences&#13;
&#13;
 between January and September versions of the WDR.      That&#13;
&#13;
 is fine, but our emphasis would be on presenting the WDR&#13;
&#13;
 that is there, not on earlier drafts, which were good&#13;
&#13;
 drafts, but we will present the WDR that was there.     That&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 is what we will try to articulate and we will try to draw&#13;
&#13;
 the implications from.&#13;
&#13;
            My own view -- and I think it has been&#13;
&#13;
 reflected around the table -- is that the difference&#13;
&#13;
 between the one that will be published and January, given&#13;
&#13;
 the length of time and given everything that we have&#13;
&#13;
 heard, was not the resigning issue.         I have said that to&#13;
&#13;
 Ravi.    He was one of my students in Oxford in the early&#13;
&#13;
 1970s.    So, there are some things that graduate&#13;
&#13;
 supervisors can say to their former graduate students,&#13;
&#13;
 and we understand each other very well.             And he has taken&#13;
&#13;
 his decision which I respect.&#13;
&#13;
            But I think not think it was a resigning issue,&#13;
&#13;
 and I still don't think it was a resigning issue.            But,&#13;
&#13;
 as I say, he is a very decent man and a fine academic,&#13;
&#13;
 and that is the decision he took.         So be it, we live with&#13;
&#13;
 it.   But we don't let it drive what we do.&#13;
&#13;
            Now on the reaction of NGOs, could I just make&#13;
&#13;
 one specific observation from my own experience?             Just&#13;
&#13;
 ten days or so ago, I met with the Director and the&#13;
&#13;
 senior policy advisors, and these two senior policy&#13;
&#13;
 advisors and the Deputy Director of Oxfam, we having sent&#13;
&#13;
 them the gray covered version.        And they have sent us&#13;
&#13;
 some very useful comments, but starting with "this is an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 excellent report" and certainly they were pretty&#13;
&#13;
 comfortable then that the main messages had been carried&#13;
&#13;
 forward from the earlier version.        Now that is just one&#13;
&#13;
 observation, but Oxfam is a very serious organization,&#13;
&#13;
 and so I was encouraged that they at least did recognize&#13;
&#13;
 some continuity there between the ideas.&#13;
&#13;
           We will have to see what, as it were,&#13;
&#13;
 organizations with slightly less graver tasks than Oxfam,&#13;
&#13;
 see what they say.     We don't know, but that we will find&#13;
&#13;
 out down the track.    It was at least encouraging that&#13;
&#13;
 Oxfam came back in this very constructive way.&#13;
&#13;
           On dissemination, this is something, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 which we are already thinking about and Nora may want to&#13;
&#13;
 add a little more on the details.        But it is something&#13;
&#13;
 which we depend very much on the collaboration of country&#13;
&#13;
 authorities where we go to give talks and so on.        So, I&#13;
&#13;
 think it will be an exercise where we certainly will want&#13;
&#13;
 to be working with many of you around this table.&#13;
&#13;
           So, let me finish as I began with thanking you&#13;
&#13;
 very much for very constructive and very encouraging&#13;
&#13;
 comments, not just for this WDR, but for future WDRs.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you, Nick.&#13;
&#13;
           Nora.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           MS. LUSTIG:    Thank you, Sven.&#13;
&#13;
           Again, I want to join Nick in thanking&#13;
&#13;
 everybody for the very useful comments.             And I want to&#13;
&#13;
 say that there were a number of specific mentions of&#13;
&#13;
 countries that you felt uncomfortable with.             We are&#13;
&#13;
 taking those very seriously and we will look at them when&#13;
&#13;
 we revise the document to prepare the final version of&#13;
&#13;
 the publication.&#13;
&#13;
           We also are hearing you in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 emphasis that you think that some of the topics have not&#13;
&#13;
 been given as much because of the location of them.              So,&#13;
&#13;
 we are going to revisit that because we have tried to put&#13;
&#13;
 gender issues very much at the top of the agenda, but we&#13;
&#13;
 framed them within a chapter in which we thought they&#13;
&#13;
 would be better served.&#13;
&#13;
           Likewise, a discussion on conflict now as in&#13;
&#13;
 Chapter 3 related to growth, maybe we need to do more&#13;
&#13;
 cross-referencing.     So, we will look at that and make&#13;
&#13;
 sure that people don't come out with the impression that&#13;
&#13;
 there are certain topics that should be given top&#13;
&#13;
 priority and they have been overlooked.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that Nick has mentioned pretty much&#13;
&#13;
 everything on what we are going to do regarding the&#13;
&#13;
 substantive matters.     Let me just add a word on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 dissemination.    Right now, we are in the midst of&#13;
&#13;
 planning the process of dissemination, and we hope it&#13;
&#13;
 will actually cover the different groups that we have&#13;
&#13;
 involved also during the consultation process, not&#13;
&#13;
 necessarily the same people but the same time of audience&#13;
&#13;
 which incorporated policymakers, representatives of civil&#13;
&#13;
 society, academics.     So, we will be moving forward in the&#13;
&#13;
 next two weeks to actually set up a plan for the&#13;
&#13;
 dissemination that we will be very happy to share with&#13;
&#13;
 whomever would be interested to see more detail&#13;
&#13;
 development of.&#13;
&#13;
           And some of the meetings have already been&#13;
&#13;
 organized or are in the process of being organized by a&#13;
&#13;
 few governments, as you are aware of, and we are very&#13;
&#13;
 happy to participate in them.       And I think that now Mike&#13;
&#13;
 might complement my presentation by commenting to you how&#13;
&#13;
 this might be linked also to activities of the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
 Institute in disseminating the WDR findings and integrate&#13;
&#13;
 it in the training and other activities of the Institute&#13;
&#13;
 in the future.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WALTON:    I won't say anything else about&#13;
&#13;
 the issues of implementation because we have heard the&#13;
&#13;
 emphasis that the Board has placed on that.         I sketched&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 our approach and we will be coming back to you to discuss&#13;
&#13;
 that in the future.&#13;
&#13;
           The one thing I would add on dissemination is&#13;
&#13;
 beyond dissemination of what is in this report and trying&#13;
&#13;
 to get a good discussion, the way we are beginning to&#13;
&#13;
 think about this in the Bank and in the Poverty Board and&#13;
&#13;
 with the WBI is to go beyond the question of what does&#13;
&#13;
 the World Bank have to say in this WDR to foster debate&#13;
&#13;
 about how you reduce poverty and to do that at different&#13;
&#13;
 levels in which WDR is a very useful instrument, but only&#13;
&#13;
 one amongst many and in which we would get beyond the&#13;
&#13;
 mold of the kind of World Bank coming and having a&#13;
&#13;
 discussion with some distinguished academics or&#13;
&#13;
 distinguished NGOs, but incorporate it into some of the&#13;
&#13;
 emerging work in terms of developing cost work, that the&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank Institute is developing very much in a&#13;
&#13;
 partnership mode with a range of institutions around the&#13;
&#13;
 world, offering either regions or countries the&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity of using this as one amongst many instruments&#13;
&#13;
 to get either public debate about broad issues, like how&#13;
&#13;
 do you confront the challenge of poverty reduction in&#13;
&#13;
 Africa, or where it is relevant to a country-specific set&#13;
&#13;
 of issues and debates that are relevant to the country&#13;
&#13;
 program, using it in that context as well.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            I just wanted to flag that this is the way we&#13;
&#13;
 are beginning to think about it.        We will be working on&#13;
&#13;
 it in the coming months and we will be happy to report to&#13;
&#13;
 you on that.&#13;
&#13;
            Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
            Let me also thank all of you for the effort&#13;
&#13;
 that you have put into this, and all the hours you put in&#13;
&#13;
 personally but also the effectiveness with which you have&#13;
&#13;
 gotten your contributions and inputs from your capitals.&#13;
&#13;
 It has really been a very intense and very helpful&#13;
&#13;
 process.&#13;
&#13;
            Now several of you said that you might&#13;
&#13;
 circulate your statements after the meeting, your talking&#13;
&#13;
 points.    And I think that would be very helpful for the&#13;
&#13;
 team.   So, even if you don't want to clean up or&#13;
&#13;
 circulate them widely, maybe you would share them with&#13;
&#13;
 the team, because we will now go through them in quite&#13;
&#13;
 some detail and make sure that we now get the final&#13;
&#13;
 version right both in terms of substance but also the way&#13;
&#13;
 it is read and what you drew out of it in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 messages and conclusions.&#13;
&#13;
            And in doing this, in reflecting on the WDR, I&#13;
&#13;
 think it is very important to keep in mind that this is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 not a document that is focused on the Bank per se, but we&#13;
&#13;
 are stepping out of the Bank and taking a very broad view&#13;
&#13;
 of development.   And that is partly also why we go beyond&#13;
&#13;
 what is the Bank's normal business lines in many areas.&#13;
&#13;
 And we really truly step back.&#13;
&#13;
           And then, it is up to each institution and each&#13;
&#13;
 country, including the Bank, to draw out of this report&#13;
&#13;
 what is relevant for that institution and that country.&#13;
&#13;
 I think that was said very well upfront in the&#13;
&#13;
 introduction, that the report reflects a comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
 way of thinking about poverty reduction, and then it is&#13;
&#13;
 up to each of us to take out of it what is relevant for&#13;
&#13;
 us.&#13;
&#13;
           Now it may be that we should give some thought&#13;
&#13;
 to whether one could add some principles for how one&#13;
&#13;
 would draw out of this report what is relevant in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of priorities and sequencing.      Because we will go through&#13;
&#13;
 that ourselves when we do the implementation note.      So,&#13;
&#13;
 we will give some thought to whether there are some&#13;
&#13;
 principles one could introduce.&#13;
&#13;
           Then, as Nick and many of you have said, the&#13;
&#13;
 overview is the key.    So, we will give special attention&#13;
&#13;
 to that and the President's foreword also.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            Then, there are these two sensitive themes in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of empowerment and the indicators that several have&#13;
&#13;
 brought up.    I agree with Nick; we will take a look at&#13;
&#13;
 them and make sure that we convey the right messages, we&#13;
&#13;
 are clear on the methodology and the judgments that would&#13;
&#13;
 go in to applying those aspects of the report.&#13;
&#13;
            We will in particular take a look at some of&#13;
&#13;
 the country references including Pakistan and make sure&#13;
&#13;
 that they are fair and that nobody is unfairly singled&#13;
&#13;
 out in the document.&#13;
&#13;
            Then there are a number of points, and this&#13;
&#13;
 list is certainly not complete -- we are going to have to&#13;
&#13;
 go through the notes more carefully -- but the question&#13;
&#13;
 of redistribution of growth, the question of market&#13;
&#13;
 reform for the poor, the broader issue of trade and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty that several of you brought up, tax reform and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty, the environment and poverty links, the conflict&#13;
&#13;
 within the population dimension, HIV/AIDS, family&#13;
&#13;
 planning, gender to be brought up certainly more clearly&#13;
&#13;
 upfront.&#13;
&#13;
            We would also take a look at regional&#13;
&#13;
 integration.    Several of you in the written statements&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned the small states.       We will take a look at that&#13;
&#13;
 as well.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
           Regional diversity, particularly the Middle&#13;
&#13;
 East, we will take a look at that and see whether we can&#13;
&#13;
 bring that out more clearly including lessons;&#13;
&#13;
 development cooperation rather than calling it&#13;
&#13;
 development assistance, we will look at this, including&#13;
&#13;
 the code of conduct suggestions, bibliography, we will&#13;
&#13;
 see what we can do about that at this stage.&#13;
&#13;
           We will also take a look at the consultative&#13;
&#13;
 process and see whether we can build in more information&#13;
&#13;
 and clarity on the process for preparing the WDR and&#13;
&#13;
 combine that also with the dissemination strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           That is on the paper.      Then, clearly, on the&#13;
&#13;
 operationalization and implementation for the Bank, Mike&#13;
&#13;
 and many of you have said much about this.         I don't have&#13;
&#13;
 anything to add except that we have a number of papers, a&#13;
&#13;
 number of work items coming to you into which this&#13;
&#13;
 document will feed.   One is the document going to the&#13;
&#13;
 Development Committee on country programs, also the one&#13;
&#13;
 on global public goods that we have to link now to the&#13;
&#13;
 WDR.&#13;
&#13;
           Then also, for later, after the annual&#13;
&#13;
 meetings, we have the strategic framework and action plan&#13;
&#13;
 into which the WDR clearly will feed as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think we have quite an agenda ahead.              We&#13;
&#13;
 know what needs to be done.      We just have to make sure we&#13;
&#13;
 do it with some discipline now.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that about covers it.            We will also&#13;
&#13;
 circulate Mike Walton's statement which Mr. Biskup asked&#13;
&#13;
 for upfront, the slides also.      They are already in the&#13;
&#13;
 back.   Okay, very good.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that does it.      Is there anything you&#13;
&#13;
 would like to add or adjust?&#13;
&#13;
           [No response.]&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    If not, let's thank the team,&#13;
&#13;
 both those who are here and those who are not, including&#13;
&#13;
 Jo Ritzen also for helping guide the effort and for not&#13;
&#13;
 saying anything today, saving us some time.&#13;
&#13;
           [Laughter.]&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    So, thanks to all of you; it&#13;
&#13;
 has been a good day but long.&#13;
