2. Progress on WSP Key Projects&#13;
&#13;
This section presents brief summaries of the largest projects under implementation by each of the&#13;
WSP regions and headquarters (HQ). These summaries focus on the project objectives,&#13;
implementation progress, and intermediate outcomes achieved. For further details, please refer to&#13;
the corresponding project implementation sheets in Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Global: The Domestic Private Sector Participation Initiative (DPSPI): Launched in June&#13;
2005, this DFID-funded, 3-year, US$12 million project aims at supporting client countries and&#13;
multilateral initiatives to leverage greater financial and technical inputs from the domestic&#13;
private sector. The DPSPI places particular focus on finding ways to unlock the potential of&#13;
small and medium service providers and to alleviate constraints to accessing market finance for&#13;
sector development by developing the supply and demand sides of the market and promoting an&#13;
enabling environment. Since the DPSPI launch, activities have started in 20 projects in 13&#13;
countries that include, among others, activities to: (a) explore alternative management models&#13;
involving domestic in rural areas (Africa) and urban areas (India); (b) improve the capacity of&#13;
local providers and their legal recognition (Nicaragua, Kenya, Burkina Faso, Cambodia); (c)&#13;
support regulatory changes that favor pro-poor utility reforms and involvement of the domestic&#13;
private sector (Benin, Kenya, Burkina Faso, India, Pakistan, Cambodia); (d) encourage sanitation&#13;
practices and behavioral change and increase demand for private sector services (Cambodia,&#13;
Vietnam, Niger, Senegal); (e) provide a comprehensive overview of the situation of small-scale&#13;
providers to develop an understanding of key factors of success (Latin America); (f) develop&#13;
case studies of successful small-scale providers (Peru, Nicaragua); and (g) improve access to&#13;
finance of small-scale providers (Kenya, Senegal). Outcomes achieved at this early stage&#13;
include: (a) pro-poor units are in place in utilities or local governments in Kisumu and Nairobi&#13;
(Kenya); (b) Goa and (Greater) Bangalore have initiated steps towards creating institutional&#13;
arrangements for community participation/ grievance redressal, as a first step towards a shift in&#13;
the power relationships between consumers and providers (public and private); (c) in Cambodia&#13;
technical training was given to 62 hitherto unlicensed private water supply providers, leading to&#13;
an increase in applications for licenses.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 2&#13;
WSP Global: The Public-Private Partnership to Promote Hand washing (PPP-HW)- The PPP-&#13;
HW works with private soap companies (Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble),&#13;
development agencies (World Bank, BNWP, USAID) and research organizations (LSHTM,&#13;
AED and CDC) to develop handwashing campaigns to reduce the incidence of diarrheal&#13;
diseases. WSP is the secretariat of the PPP-HW and one of its main implementing partners.&#13;
Activities implemented in the first half of FY06 included: (a) supporting existing country&#13;
programs and establishing new ones in additional countries; (b) fund-raising and partnership&#13;
building; and (c) knowledge sharing and mainstreaming of handwashing programs into projects.&#13;
During FY06, the handwashing program in Peru was launched where capacity building efforts&#13;
also continued as well as provision of technical assistance in procurement in Senegal and&#13;
recruitment of a HW Coordinator for Madagascar. WSP has been successful in raising awareness&#13;
on the importance of hand washing, resulting in a greater than anticipated demand for support&#13;
from countries in which programs exist (Peru, Senegal, Madagascar and Ghana) and in&#13;
establishment of new programs in Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Paraguay, Tanzania and&#13;
Vietnam. Serious interest has also been expressed in Bolivia, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Benin,&#13;
Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Bangladesh but WSP does not have the funding to respond to this&#13;
group of countries. WSP support in awareness-rising is also strengthening existing partnerships&#13;
with Unilever and USAID for which an agreement for US$450,000 is being finalized. A wide&#13;
range of other institutions have joined the effort at different stages, for instance the IRC which is&#13;
in the process of translating the School Sanitation Toolkit (completed last fiscal year) into&#13;
Spanish and French. The Handwashing Secretariat also played a key role in raising awareness of&#13;
the importance of hand washing in preventing Avian Flu epidemics. Efforts to mainstream&#13;
handwashing into projects are also experiencing results, for example in Ecuador where the&#13;
Handwashing Secretariat is working to incorporate a handwashing component in a $48-million&#13;
World Bank-funded project that is under preparation.&#13;
&#13;
WP Global: 2006 Development Marketplace (DM) on Water, Sanitation and Energy: WSP and&#13;
ESMAP (the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program) are the technical partners for this&#13;
year's DM2006 whose theme is "Innovations for Water, Sanitation and Energy Services to the&#13;
Poor". The DM looks for innovative solutions from a range of development innovators - civil&#13;
society groups, social entrepreneurs, private foundations, government agencies, academia, the&#13;
private sector, and international organizations. Over 2,500 proposals were received from 155&#13;
countries (25% from Africa) along four sub-themes: (a) Service Delivery: Sustainable delivery of&#13;
water supply, sanitation and/or energy services to poor households; (b) Environment: Renewable&#13;
energy, clean energy technologies, energy efficiency, and/or environmentally sustainable&#13;
solutions to poor households and to small enterprises; (c) Health: Protecting health from&#13;
environmental risk factors (indoor air pollution, contaminated drinking water, unsafe sanitation),&#13;
including innovative programs hygiene promotion and behavioral change; (d) Natural Resources:&#13;
Sustainable management of natural resources (land, water, forest) specifically for the provision&#13;
of water supply, sanitation and energy to the poor. A total of 45% of the applications that were&#13;
submitted relate to water supply and 27% to sanitation. This is a result of the active outreach in&#13;
WSP's focus countries which attracted a more diverse pool of proposals than in previous years.&#13;
Fundraising efforts succeeded in raising $4 million out of a target of $6 million.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Africa: Developing Sanitation Knowledge ­ This four-year, US$1.2 million project aims to&#13;
develop and disseminate sanitation knowledge across Africa with full programs to be piloted in&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 3&#13;
at least three countries. Under the project, WSP has developed a sanitation marketing framework&#13;
which includes (a) subsidy policy, (b) learning from the market, (c) over-coming barriers to&#13;
sanitation demand, and (d) developing the right products and supporting a sanitation industry.&#13;
The project has also supported networking for knowledge development and sharing through&#13;
regional and sub-regional conferences (Africasan, Africasan South, East and West/Central) to&#13;
promote sanitation issues and coordinate responses to sanitation demands. WSP has also&#13;
provided investment support to Niger, Senegal and Tanzania under which over 60,000 facilities&#13;
have been constructed and development of condominial system initiated in Senegal. An urban&#13;
pilot sanitation project has been completed in Niamey (Niger) and lessons learnt are being&#13;
documented and published. WSP support has contributed to improved access to sanitation&#13;
products including EcoSan solutions, driven by a better understanding of sanitation drivers. The&#13;
project is now in a follow-up phase to consolidate and translate the knowledge that has been&#13;
generated into actions which will mainly include: (a) rolling out sanitation marketing in selected&#13;
countries; (b) continued and enhanced investment support to Niger, Senegal and Tanzania; and&#13;
(c) developing sanitation advocacy toolkits to be implemented in the 2-3 countries in which the&#13;
SanMark program will be rolled out. Other planned key activities include: (a) analytical work on&#13;
economic and financial aspects of Ecosan, (b) comparative study on SanMark Implementation&#13;
approaches; and (c) strengthening advocacy and knowledge sharing through regional and sub-&#13;
regional high-level conferences to raise the profile of sanitation in the policy and cross-country&#13;
dialogues and lesson sharing. The project has recently received additional funding from SIDA&#13;
for an expanded phase.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-Africa: MDGs in Africa: This 3-year, US$5.5 million Sida-funded project is now in its final&#13;
year. The project aims to assist 4 WSP focus countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Burkina Faso and&#13;
Uganda) meet the MDGs through supporting: (a) development of country owned MDG&#13;
roadmaps, (b) key regional institutions, (c) sector coordination, and (d) analyses and knowledge&#13;
sharing on sanitation marketing and Ecosan. During FY06, partnership and coordination&#13;
mechanisms were started with AMCOW, AFDB and NEPAD. WSP also submitted a proposal to&#13;
AFDB for setting up a WSP liaison office in Tunis. A partnership office has been established for&#13;
the AMCOW president and WSP seconded a full time staff member to provide continuous&#13;
support to AMCOW's work program. WSP has strengthened support to the implementation of&#13;
this project by opening country offices in Tanzania and Burkina Faso and recruiting senior WSS&#13;
specialists for Kenya and Uganda. A Water and Sanitation MDG roadmap development toolkit&#13;
(includes MDG process guide and TORs, financial flows analysis framework, M&amp;E model,&#13;
coordination guide, reporting format) has been completed. WSS MDG roadmaps have also been&#13;
completed for all WSP focus countries. In addition, draft Water and Sanitation MDG Country&#13;
Status Overview (WSS MDG CSO) have been prepared for 20 countries in which stakeholder&#13;
consultation is ongoing to ensure national ownership and to put in place, capacity and processes&#13;
for updating the roadmaps and CSOs and for supporting M&amp;E. Key outcomes resulting from this&#13;
project are that WSS roadmap processes are under implementation in Benin, Burkina Faso,&#13;
Ghana, Niger, Senegal and Ghana while CSO processes are under implementation for Benin,&#13;
Burkina, Cape Verde, DRC, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal. The focus for the&#13;
remaining part of FY06 will be to finalize CSO consultations at country level, organize regional&#13;
CSO conferences, organize training and capacity building for participating countries, and&#13;
develop M&amp;E systems.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   4&#13;
WSP-East Asia: Water Supply and Sanitation Policy and Action Planning (WASPOLA II) in&#13;
Indonesia- The goal of this four-year, US$6.2 million phase of the project is to support the&#13;
Government of Indonesia (GOI) adopt, implement and monitor a comprehensive water and&#13;
sanitation sector policy framework encompassing both community- and institutionally-managed&#13;
services. During the review period, WSP supported GOI to increase efforts in policy&#13;
implementation and broadening the policy framework to incorporate institutionally managed&#13;
services by: (a) operationalizing the national policy at district level, (b) preparing national&#13;
strategies and local actions to achieve the MDGs, (c) carrying out field trials to generate&#13;
knowledge on options for delivering WSS services at affordable costs, (d) increasing capacity&#13;
implementation of institutionally managed WSS services, and (e) increasing emphasis on&#13;
environmental sanitation. Field trials in Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) have been&#13;
completed, results disseminated and stakeholder consensus built through workshops involving&#13;
national and local government and NGOs; field trials in 6 district-level governments; and rapid&#13;
expansion over a few months from the first few communities to about 30 by end 2005. Other&#13;
outcomes include: (a) Guidelines and Tools for Policy implementation and scale up to achieve&#13;
local MDG targets completed and endorsed and are now being disseminated by local&#13;
governments (LGs); (b) Financing strategy for LGs to achieve the MDGs and operationalize&#13;
sector policy completed; (c) Training of national and district teams completed to disseminate and&#13;
build capacity and dialogue on the new policy. The focus over the remaining period will be to&#13;
develop an M&amp;E strategy, continued dissemination of the national policy and incorporation of&#13;
lessons from field trials into a national sanitation and hygiene strategy.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-East Asia: Indonesia Sanitation Sector Development Project (ISSDP): This is a new 3-year,&#13;
US$7 million component of a $22 million Dutch-funded project under which WSP will assist the&#13;
Government of Indonesia (GOI) develop an enabling environment to stimulate investments and&#13;
improve services in sanitation through strengthened policy framework, strategies, regulation,&#13;
institutions and building capacity of all key national and local institutions mandated. Under the&#13;
project, WSP will: (a) assist in building awareness on the need for improved sanitation and&#13;
capacity of key stakeholders; (b) elaborate a comprehensive sanitation policy and regulatory&#13;
framework, (c) test the financing, technical, poverty and capacity building strategies to&#13;
operationalize the policy, and (d) clarify the institutional framework for sanitation at national,&#13;
provincial and local levels.. WSP support has contributed to the formation of GOI Sanitation&#13;
Working Group to coordinate ministries and resources for sanitation development. It has also&#13;
initiated an important study The State of Sanitation in Indonesia: the Cost of Doing Nothing to&#13;
raise awareness on the dire state of sanitation and mobilize the support and resources needed.&#13;
Good collaboration has been established with donors such as the World Bank, Ausaid, SIDA,&#13;
ADB, USAID that are active in the sanitation field and a good foundation for implementing the&#13;
project had been laid, with strong leadership from the planning agency (BAPPENAS). WSP will&#13;
continue to support development of an enabling investment framework for sanitation, create&#13;
sanitation demand and build the capacity of key agencies such as LGs and water utilities&#13;
(PDAMs), in the implementation of the sanitation policy including strategies for providing&#13;
sanitation to poor urban communities. The project is in its first year where the focus has been on&#13;
relationship and foundation-building and mobilization of needed resources to ensure successful&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 5&#13;
WSP-Latin America: Strengthening WSS services in small towns: The objective of this 3-year,&#13;
US$4 million project is to develop new water supply and sanitation management models in 10&#13;
small towns, using a public-private-social approach. The implementation of this project is in its&#13;
third year, and it is currently focusing on: (a) improving local government capacity to monitor&#13;
service quality, (b) finalizing and validating management models, (c) developing sector&#13;
information systems, and (d) conducting studies to evaluate users' payment capacity and&#13;
supporting three municipalities in service rehabilitation. The socio-economic studies in three&#13;
municipalities, the preparation of sector assessment, and the development of intervention&#13;
guidelines are under way. The focus for the rest of the fiscal year will be to finalize the process&#13;
of contracting specialized operators for the small towns, disseminate and replicate lessons learnt&#13;
at national level and incorporate them into government policy, and finally, to develop a sector&#13;
information system.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-South Asia: Utility/City Level Reforms: WSP had been a driving force in the Delhi Jal&#13;
Board (DJB) reform program, a 4-year, US$1.5m. project to improve WSS services in Delhi, one&#13;
of the largest utilities in the world, by re-introducing 24/7 water supply, focusing on&#13;
management, robust communications and interactions with parliamentarians. The key activity&#13;
planned for FY06 was the development of institutional, regulatory and technical options for&#13;
reforms in Delhi though preparation of a performance agreement with Delhi government, and an&#13;
incremental approach to partnerships with the private sector. This activity, the key one under this&#13;
project for this FISCAL YEAR, has been put on hold pending a review of the partnership with&#13;
the private sector as the approach to improving services in Delhi and determination of a way&#13;
forward by the government. In the meantime, however, WSP has completed a demand&#13;
assessment study and is continuing to support mechanisms for reaching the poor and to advocate&#13;
for reforms that will ensure 24/7 services to users.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-All regions: The Global Practice Teams (GPTs): In an initiative to strengthen global&#13;
learning and knowledge management, WSP established GPTs, which are virtual teams of experts&#13;
in a given subject area/topic that are: (a) taking the lead in generating knowledge in specific&#13;
thematic areas, (b) ensuring quality enhancement of WSP products, and (c) the main thematic&#13;
interlocutors with the World Bank and other IFIs and donor agencies. Five GPTs on strategic&#13;
communications for Reform, Finance, Rural Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, and Urban Poor and&#13;
Domestic Private Sector were established and are in the process of implementing their work&#13;
programs. GPT projects include activities to: (a) enhance WSP's capacity to support strategic&#13;
communication initiatives of institutions in client and other countries (Communications GPT);&#13;
(b) improve public financial management practices in the use of WSS relater public/donor&#13;
resources by stakeholders and leverage additional local/domestic resources for WSS (Finance&#13;
GPT); (c) develop and implement a global strategy of communication and dissemination for&#13;
sanitation and hygiene knowledge resources (Sanitation and Hygiene GPT); (d) develop&#13;
improved management models for RWSS and carry out analytical work on productive use of&#13;
water and the link with poverty reduction (Rural GPT); and (e) help utilities to develop and&#13;
implement roadmaps for institutional reforms including options for increasing access to the poor&#13;
(Urban GPT). The activities of the urban GPT are closely linked to many of the DPSPI activities.&#13;
The GPTs have successfully built their cross-regional teams and launched many of the activities&#13;
in their work plans. They are also building vital linkages with the World Bank through the&#13;
various Thematic Groups and with other partners as well as identifying national/regional/global&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  6&#13;
fora in which they can share and disseminate their work. WSP will continue to maintain a&#13;
balance between country and regional/global activities to ensure that the focus remains at&#13;
country level where new knowledge generated by the GPTs is expected to enhance our clients'&#13;
efforts at increasing access to sustainable WSS.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Delivery Status&#13;
&#13;
One of the main objectives of the Mid-Year Review is to identify projects: (i) that are delayed&#13;
and require corrective measures, (ii) whose scope of work requires modification, and (iii) that&#13;
can be expanded based on additional funding received during the first half of the fiscal year or&#13;
through budget re-allocations. The mid-year review focuses not only on the project outputs, but&#13;
also on progress towards achievement of intermediate milestones in an effort to improve&#13;
monitoring and documentation of project impacts.&#13;
&#13;
The MYR analysis indicates that 65% of the 114 projects were progressing well on target. Only&#13;
2% of the projects were dropped due to difficulties with implementation. For purposes of the&#13;
MYR, projects are defined to be delayed if the delivery of their intermediate outputs is delayed&#13;
by more than two months and this delay may jeopardize on-time delivery of FY06 outputs. The&#13;
MYR has given an opportunity to WSP management to review the reasons for project delays. In&#13;
order of importance, these reasons include:&#13;
&#13;
   a)       Difficulties with trust fund set up, project accounts, and hiring of personnel were&#13;
            underestimated by task managers who were used to plan outputs for projects already&#13;
            under implementation. While these delays are normal, the original project plans were&#13;
            too optimistic for a large number of projects initiated in FY06;&#13;
   b)       Change in focus/topics (e.g. the Delhi Jal Board in India) and government processes&#13;
            that contributed to delays for 12 projects, mainly affecting South Asia and East Asia;&#13;
   c)       Staff changes especially Task Managers that contributed to delays for 8 projects,&#13;
            particularly affecting East Asia and South Asia regions;&#13;
   d)       Complex procurement processes and deficiencies in procurement processes&#13;
            contributed to delays for 7 projects; and&#13;
   e)       Delayed funding and receipt of donor contribustions, that contributed to delays for 4&#13;
            projects and mainly affected South Asia and East Asia.&#13;
&#13;
As part of the MYR, task managers, regional team leaders, and the program manager have&#13;
identified actions to accelerate implementation progress to improve the delivery status of the&#13;
delayed projects. Several measures have been already implemented, including: (i) completion of&#13;
a comprehensive human resources hiring program; (ii) establishment of a procurement systems&#13;
task force and implementation of recommendations; (iii) hiring of a global administration&#13;
coordinator and senior resource management officer; and (iv) realism analysis of project sheets.&#13;
In addition, WSP management will take the following actions to strengthen business planning&#13;
and implementation:&#13;
&#13;
   · finalize the revision of the HR plan to more adequately respond to an expanding program;&#13;
   · staff training to strengthen procurement planning and to streamline the business planning&#13;
        process; and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                      7&#13;
    · develop a system for more rigorous quality review of projects at entry in particular to&#13;
       ensure realism in new projects.&#13;
&#13;
4.     FY06 Operating Budget&#13;
&#13;
As Table 1 shows, WSP had initially budgeted US$26.7million in the FY06 Business Plan. The&#13;
FY06 budget was launched with a $23.4 million allocation. The revisions at mid-year increased&#13;
this budget by $3.0 million bringing it to a current revised operating budget of $26.4 million.&#13;

5.     FY06 Mid-year Operating Budget and Expenditure&#13;
&#13;
As can be seen in Table 2 below, at mid-year (12/31/2005), US$8.8million or 38% of the&#13;
operating budget has been disbursed. Commitments1 as of December 31 2005 stood at US$4.6&#13;
million. Overall budget utilization (expenditures plus commitments) stood at 57% which is&#13;
within a reasonable range at mid-year.&#13;

&#13;
Table 3 below shows that at MYR06 (12/31/2005), a total of US$8.8 million had been disbursed&#13;
compared to US$7.4 million at MYR05 (12/31/2004). This increase is the result of WSP&#13;

implementing more and larger projects than in FY05. Based on the disbursement trend of FY05,&#13;
the use of funds of the revised operating budget is proceeding well.&#13;

7.       Fund Raising Activities&#13;
&#13;
Since the FY05 End-year Report, two agreements are now under preparation for the East Asia&#13;
Region with SIDA: one for Sustainable Sanitation in East Asia (SUSEA) targeted to Indonesia&#13;
and the Philippines (estimated US$ 8.03 million over 4 years), and the other for sanitation and&#13;
water for the Mekong region (estimated US$ 4.45 million over 2 ½ years), in partnership with&#13;
the Stockholm Environment Institute and International Development Enterprises (in an effort to&#13;
implement the WSP Funding Strategy reviewed and endorsed by the WSP Council in its 2005&#13;
meeting). The Mekong region program is planned to be established as a multidonor trust fund,&#13;
kicking off this new mechanism proposed at the last WSP Council meeting in 2005.&#13;
&#13;
There have been advances on a number of other fronts as well in the area of fund-raising. The&#13;
Gates Foundation has indicated strong interest in providing US$ 1.2 million to support the&#13;
Development Marketplace competitive grant program for 2006, and an agreement is being drawn&#13;
up. Advanced discussions are also underway with other potential new funding partners, including&#13;
Google Foundation for the Development Marketplace and USAID for the Global Handwashing&#13;
Partnership.&#13;
&#13;
As part of the reporting commitments associated with the WSP Funding Strategy approved by&#13;
the WSP Council in June 2005, this MYR includes a table of indicators to be used for semi-&#13;
annual reporting. Table 4 below provides the first such monitoring report based on the indicators&#13;
in the Funding Strategy.&#13;
&#13;

                                                             beyond&#13;

                                                                       Google Foundation, USAID)&#13;

&#13;
The first indicator, which read "total funding commitments" in the Funding Strategy document,&#13;
has been restated as "total funds available" to the program for the current fiscal year and beyond.&#13;
This precision facilitates comparable data collection going forward. Funds are considered&#13;
available to the program on the basis of cash on hand at the start of a fiscal year plus receipts&#13;
expected on formally signed agreements at the prevailing US dollar rates of exchange.&#13;
&#13;
"Untied Core funding" has been defined to include funds without specific restrictions to support&#13;
the overall work program of WSP but excludes funds specified to a subset of countries within a&#13;
region or specific themes or activities.&#13;
&#13;
The difference in total funds available in the last six-month period relates to the signing of new&#13;
multi-year agreements with France (Agence Francaise de Développement, a new partner for&#13;
WSP), Sweden (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency - SIDA) and&#13;
Switzerland (Swiss Agency for Development Corporation), although these funds had already&#13;
been agreed in principle at the time of the last Council.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Human Resources&#13;
&#13;
In order to implement effectively the expanded program of activities, the human resources of&#13;
WSP are increasing. WSP decided to coordinate its recruitment efforts with the World Bank for a&#13;
comprehensive search across regions. WSP and the World Bank have joined forces to share costs&#13;
and increase the reach of the announcement, particularly to developing countries. The job&#13;
vacancy announcements were posted in the World Bank's intranet, the Economist, Jeune Africa,&#13;
East Africa, Wall Street Jounal ­ ASia InfoBae (Argentina), Reforma (Mexico) and the Gazeta&#13;
Mercantil (Brazil). Information about the cluster requirement was also circulated in a number of&#13;
internet magazines and e-newsletters. In addition, all members of the World Bank's Water Sector&#13;
were notified about the ongoing exercise and were asked to inform their peers about the pipeline&#13;
building effort in the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
At the moment, WSP has 40 GE+ (professional level) staff members and 41 extended term&#13;
consultants (ETCs). These two categories are part of the full-time staff working in WSP projects.&#13;
They are complemented by a team of administrative staff and highly specialized short-term&#13;
consultants. In the first six months of the FY06, 5 staff/ETCs departed and 22 have been hired.&#13;
&#13;
The senior staff recruited during the first semester of FY06 includes:&#13;

            This summary presents the main points
            and statistics from the mid-year implementation progress
            review of the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP). The
            Mid-Year Report (MYR) includes, in addition to this summary,
            detailed project-level implementation progress sheets (Annex
            1) and new project sheets for new and expanded projects that
            received additional funding at mid-year (Annex 2). This MYR
            summary provides an overview of the WSP's key projects,
            a summary of project delivery status, budget and
            expenditures, and human resources.
