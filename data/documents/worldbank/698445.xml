        <abstracts>
            Mass privatization is a viable
            alternative to conventional case-by-case privatization
            methods. Recent experience in Eastern Europe and the former
            Soviet Union shows that mass privatization programs are an
            effective way to privatize large numbers of enterprises in a
            short period of time. In addition, because these programs
            have spurred the development of capital markets and
            therefore the ability to buy and sell shares of enterprises,
            in some cases mass privatization has proven to be effective
            in subjecting enterprises to the test and rigor of the
            market. Results from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
            Union suggest that the privatization process should be as
            decentralized as possible. Setting deadlines for completion
            is useful. Public relations campaigns are important to
            educate the public about privatization in general and about
            specific selling mechanisms. This Note looks at key
            decisions in the design of mass privatization programs. The
            supply-side issues deal with the bundle of firms to be
            privatized demand-side issues address the buyer side of the
            transactions. Country examples are illustrative and not comprehensive.
