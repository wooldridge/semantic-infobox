FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report.     The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family  planning   programs.    They  include   several  country  and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis  and  research,   and  on reports   of other   organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.        The&#13;
papers   are   the   work   of   individuals   and   the  views   and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and development issues among students and practitioners of&#13;
development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
Indian fertility has declined by at least 25 percent in the last&#13;
twenty years. The current total fertility rate is 4.8, which is lower than&#13;
that in any other country at the same or a lower level of socioeconomic&#13;
development, as measured by per capita income, infant mortality, female&#13;
education, and the like. Since 1975, however, decline in the the birth rate&#13;
has shown a tendency to stall. This is partly due to an emerging unfavorable&#13;
age structure (increase in the proportion of women of childbearing age) and&#13;
partly due to stagnation in the family planning acceptance rate.&#13;
Nearly 90 percent of the fertility decline in the period 1961-81&#13;
can be accounted for by the increase in family planning practice, and the&#13;
balance by an increase in the age at marriage. Although family planning&#13;
practice can account for much of the fertility differences, family planning&#13;
input variables--manpower, budget, etc.--were much less important than&#13;
socioeconomic factors such as female education and children's health in&#13;
explaining the practice of family planning. About 60 percent of the inter-&#13;
state variation in family planning practice (and hence fertility decline)&#13;
can be attributed to socioeconomic differences, 10 percent to differences&#13;
in family planning inputs, and the remaining 30 percent to their interaction.&#13;
Our interpretation of the extent, pattern, and socioeconomic&#13;
correlates of fertility decline in India is that, in the changing socio-&#13;
economic situation, the increase in the cost of bringing up children creates&#13;
a situation in which a smaller family size is becoming an economic necessity&#13;
to an increasing number of couples. The family planning program served not&#13;
only this emerging demand for small families, but created additional demand&#13;
for contraception through information and incentives.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Condense&#13;
Au cours des vingt dernieres ann6es, la fecondite a baiss6 d'au&#13;
moins 25 % en Inde. Actuellement, le taux de fecondite totale est de 4,8,&#13;
c'est-a-dire inferieur a celui de tout autre pays se situant au meme&#13;
niveau que l'Inde ou a un niveau inferieur pour ce qui est du&#13;
d6veloppement socioeconomique mesur6 d'apres le revenu par habitant, la&#13;
mortalite infantile, l'6ducation des femmes, et autres criteres analogues.&#13;
Toutefois, depuis 1975, ce flechissement du taux de natalit6 semble&#13;
stoppe. Cela est da en partie a l'apparition d'une structure defavorable&#13;
de la pyramide des ages (accroissement de la proportion des femmes en age&#13;
de procreer) et en partie a la stagnation du taux d'acceptation du&#13;
planning familial.&#13;
Le declin de la fecondite qui s'observe au cours de la periode&#13;
1961-81 peut etre attribu6 pour pres de 90 % au d6veloppement de la&#13;
pratique du planning familial et, pour le reste, au fait que le mariage&#13;
est contract6 a un age plus avanc6. Si la pratique du planning familial&#13;
explique en grande partie les differences de taux de f6condite, les&#13;
variables du programme de planning familial - personnel, budget, etc. -&#13;
ont contribu6 de facon beaucoup moins importante que les facteurs&#13;
socioeconomiques tels que l'education des femmes et la sant6 des enfants a&#13;
cette pratique. Les diff6rences entre Etats dans la pratique du planning&#13;
familial (et par cons6quent dans la baisse de la fecondite) peuvent etre&#13;
attribuees pour environ 60 % aux differences socioeconomiques, pour 10 %&#13;
aux differences dans les variables du planning familial et pour les 30 %&#13;
restants a l'interaction entre les unes et les autres.&#13;
Notre interpretation de l'ampleur, des caracteristiques et des&#13;
causes socioeconomiques du declin de la fecondite observ6 en Inde est que,&#13;
dans une situation socioeconomique en 6volution, comme il devient de plus&#13;
en plus coateux d'elever un enfant, un nombre croissant de couples se&#13;
voient obliges pour des raisons economiques de limiter la taille de leur&#13;
famille. Non seulement le programme de planning familial a permis de&#13;
repondre a ce nouveau besoin de se contenter d'une petite famille, mais il&#13;
a suscite, par le biais de l'information et des encouragements, un regain&#13;
de la demande de contraception.&#13;
&#13;

Extracto&#13;
La fecundidad en la India ha disminuido por lo menos en un 25%&#13;
en los 6ltimos veinte anos. La tasa total de fecundidad es actualmente de&#13;
4,8, mas baja que la de cualquier otro pais de igual o menor nivel de&#13;
desarrollo socioecon6mico, medido en funci6n del ingreso per capita, la&#13;
mortalidad infantil, la educaci6n femenina y otros parametros similares.&#13;
Sin embargo, desde 1975 la declinaci6n de la tasa de natalidad ha mostrado&#13;
tendencia a detenerse. Esto se debe en parte al surgimiento de una desfa-&#13;
vorable estructura de la poblaci6n por edades (aumento de la proporcion de&#13;
mujeres en edad de procrear) y en parte al estancamiento de la tasa de&#13;
aceptaci6n de la planificaci6n de la familia.&#13;
Cerca del 90% de la disminuci6n de la fecundidad en el periodo&#13;
de 1961-81 puede atribuirse al incremento en la practica de la planifica-&#13;
ci6n de la familia y el resto a la elevaci6n de la edad para contraer&#13;
matrimonio. Aunque a la planificaci6n familiar cabe achacar gran parte de&#13;
las diferencias en cuanto a fecundidad, las variables de estos programas&#13;
usadas como insumos --recursos humanos, presupuestos, etc.-- fueron mucho&#13;
menos importantes que ciertos factores socioecon6micos, tales como la edu-&#13;
caci6n de las mujeres y la salud infantil, para explicar la practica de la&#13;
planificaci6n de la familia. Alrededor del 60% de la variaci6n interesta-&#13;
tal en dicha practica (y, por ende, en la disminuci6n de la fecundidad)&#13;
puede atribuirse a diferencias socioecon6micas, el 10% a diferencias en&#13;
los insumos de planificaci6n de la familia y el 30% restante a la interac-&#13;
ci6n de esos factores.&#13;
Nuestra interpretaci6n del alcance, la configuraci6n y las&#13;
caracteristicas socioecon6micas conexas de la disminuci6n de la fecundidad&#13;
en la India es que, en las circunstancias socioecon6micas cambiantes, el&#13;
aumento del costo de la crianza y la educaci6n de los hijos crea una&#13;
situaci6n en la que el tener una familia mas reducida esta volvi6ndose una&#13;
necesidad econ6mica para un numero cada vez mayor de parejas.    El programa&#13;
de planificaci6n de la familia no solamente fue de utilidad para atender&#13;
esta naciente demanda de familias pequefias, sino que cre6 una demanda adi-&#13;
cional de anticoncepci6n por medio de informaci6n e incentivos.&#13;

Summary and Conclusions&#13;
This paper is concerned with an analysis of the determinants of&#13;
fertility decline in India. Inasmuch as facts about the extent and&#13;
patterns of fertility trend in India are not well documented this paper&#13;
also attempts to present available information on fertility trend at the&#13;
national and state level.&#13;
The Indian birth rate is now around 34 per 1,000 population and&#13;
the total fertility rate (TFR) is about 4.8. Prior to 1950 the birth rate&#13;
was about 45 and the TFR about 6.5. Thus, India has definitely experienced&#13;
a fairly significant fertility decline in recent years; a decline of at&#13;
least 25 percent in the last 20 years.&#13;
Much of the decline in the birth rate took place before 1976.&#13;
Since then, the birth rate has shown a tendency to stall. The factors&#13;
underlying this stalling have also been analysed in this paper.&#13;
All the Indian states have experienced some degree of fertility&#13;
decline in recent years. The extent of the decline varied from as little&#13;
as 4 to 5 points in the birth rate in some of the northern states to 15 to&#13;
18 points in some of the southern states. In 5 states, mostly in the&#13;
south, with a combined population of 200 million, the birth rate has&#13;
already declined below 30, but in 4 other states, mostly in the north, with&#13;
a combined population of over 250 million, the rate is still only&#13;
marginally below 40. Sustainable fertility decline of a significant&#13;
magnitude is yet to begin in some of these north Indian states.&#13;
Much of the fertility decline since 1960 could be accounted for&#13;
by increase in contraceptive practice. The other proximate variables --&#13;
nuptiality, abortion, and lactation -- played relatively minor roles. The&#13;
effect of increase in age at marriage or decrease in proportion married at&#13;
younger ages, was partly offset by increase in age at widowhood or increase&#13;
in proportion married at older ages. The effect of increase in the&#13;
practice of abortion was counterbalanced by the effect of decrease in&#13;
breast feeding or a decrease in the period of lactation infecundity&#13;
period. Ignoring abortion and lactation for which needed data at the&#13;
national level are not available, a rough calculation indicates that 90&#13;
percent of the fertility decline in India during 1971-81 was attributable&#13;
to increase in contraceptive practice and the balance 10 percent to changes&#13;
in nuptiality rates. The proportion of couples protected by the official&#13;
family planning program increased by about 12 points during 1961-71 and&#13;
1971-81 and the TFR declined by 0.8 points in both the decades. The&#13;
nuptiality factor had slightly larger influence in 1971-81 than in 1961-71,&#13;
but inspite of this increase, its relative contribution to fertility&#13;
decline was only about 10 percent.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- wiii -&#13;
Nearly all the state-wise variation in fertility rate (91&#13;
percent) and in family planning practice rates (81 percent) can be&#13;
explained by a few socio-economic variables and family planning program&#13;
input variables. The socio-economic variables which had statistically&#13;
significant association with fertility rates were female literacy (which&#13;
accounts for 64 percent of the explained variance) infant mortality rate&#13;
(16 percent of the variance) female agricultural wages (9 percent) and per&#13;
capita cropped area (7 percent). Those which had significant association&#13;
with family planning practice were: literacy rate of the state (49 percent&#13;
of the explained variance) and per capita domestic product (15 percent of&#13;
the variance). Female wages did not show a statistically significant&#13;
association with family planning practice rate.&#13;
On the whole, socio-economic variables have had a relatively&#13;
larger effect on family planning practice rate than family planning input&#13;
variables. A rough breakdown is: socio-economic variables 60 percent,&#13;
family planning variables 10 percent, and the interaction between them 30&#13;
percent. The principal program variable was per capita expenditure on&#13;
family welfare which accounted for about 24 percent of the explained&#13;
variance of family planning practice rate.&#13;
The stalling of the birth rate since 1975 is related to two&#13;
factors. One is a demographic factor. Between 1961 and 1971 the changes&#13;
in age-sex composition in India was conducive to a decline in the birth&#13;
rate. However, between 1971 and 1981 this was no longer true. If the&#13;
age-sex composition had remained unchanged, the decline in the birth rate&#13;
would have been higher by 19 percent during 1971-81. Since the reversal&#13;
took place between these decades, its effect would have to be much higher&#13;
in the latter half of the decade (i.e., during 1976-81). Thus, the full&#13;
effect of the decline in fertility rate is not translated into birth rate&#13;
in this period.&#13;
A second factor involved in the stalled birth rate is the&#13;
stalling of the contraceptive acceptance rate. Between 1971 and 1976 the&#13;
proportion of couples effectively protected by the official program&#13;
increased by 13 points, but between 1976 and 1981 the proportion hardly&#13;
changed at all. The reasons behind the stalled contraceptive practice rate&#13;
are likely to be both demand and supply related.&#13;
There is little that can be done to reverse the demographic&#13;
trend.  The proportion of women in the reproductive ages is likely to&#13;
increase for several more decades. However, the problem of stagnation in&#13;
family planning acceptance rate is amenable to policy interventions.&#13;
Our analysis has indicated that family planning is a feasible&#13;
option to reduce fertility in the Indian setting. For about 200 million&#13;
people living in 5 separate states, the fertility has declined to&#13;
relatively low levels and for these states the prospects of a replacement&#13;
level fertility by the year 2000 is within easy reach. The analysis has&#13;
also indicated that inspite of the dominant part played by the family&#13;
planning program as a means of fertility reduction, socio-economic factors&#13;
have been much more important than program input variables in explaining&#13;
interstate variation in fertility rate and family planning use. Given the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xi)V -&#13;
socio-economic conditions, the fertility level in India is relatively low,&#13;
lower than that of the any other country in the world with the same or&#13;
lower level of socio-economic development. Thus, it appears that a major&#13;
requirement for a further increase in contraceptive prevalence rate in&#13;
India is improvements in socio-economic conditions. This means principally&#13;
further reduction in infant mortality rates and increase in female&#13;
education especially in states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Rajastan&#13;
and Madhya Pradesh, where the IMR is above 100 and female literacy rate is&#13;
below 20 percent.&#13;
The family planning program input variables examined in this&#13;
study were too few to give any definite conclusion regarding the exact&#13;
contribution of program variables in relation to that of socio-economic&#13;
variables. Our estimate is likely to be on the low side. Other studies&#13;
have indicated that family planning programs can be used and in fact used&#13;
to reduce the desired family size and strengthen the demand for family&#13;
planning services. What is important is to develop the right information&#13;
and communication strategy.&#13;
Marital status composition was not a factor in the stalled birth&#13;
rate, as its contribution to the decline in birth rate was marginally&#13;
higher in 1971-81 than in 1961-71. However, barely 10 percent of the&#13;
fertility decline in India in 1971-81 was contributed by increase in age at&#13;
marriage. At the present low average age at marriage of women in India,&#13;
the potential for fertility reduction through increase in age at marriage&#13;
is much larger. This is a means of fertility reduction which is very much&#13;
untapped in most states of India and deserves as much attention and&#13;
financial backing as the family planning program.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
The Indian birth rate is now around 34 per 1,000 population and&#13;
the TFR is about 4.8.1/ Prior to 1950 the birth rate was about 45 and the&#13;
TFR was about 6.5. Thius India has definitely experienced a fairly&#13;
significant fertility decline in recent years.&#13;
Recent data show that the decline in the birth rate is not&#13;
continuing as fast as it did in the past; the rate has stalled somewhat at&#13;
a level of about 34. Although such a stalling has been observed in a few&#13;
other developing countries in recent years, it was not expected on the&#13;
basis of historical experience of developed countries.     In the past, at a&#13;
level of 34, a birth rate usually declined rapidly. For example,&#13;
international data on birth rates for the 195U's and 1960's show that there&#13;
were few countries with birth rates in the. range of 30-34; most of the&#13;
national birth rates were either above 35 or below 25.2/ The Indian birth&#13;
rate is in this range, and therefore, it should have b7een declining more&#13;
rapidly. Yet the decline is slow; the rate appears to have stalled. There&#13;
appear to be some basic differences between the factors which moderated&#13;
fertility in the 1950's and earlier, and those which seem to be operating&#13;
in India and in some of the other developing countries at present. What&#13;
are the factors which caused the Indian fertility to decrease in recent&#13;
years? In what ways do the determinants of the recent fertility decline in&#13;
India differ from those of other countries in earlier times?     This paper is&#13;
concerned mainly with these questions.&#13;
The paper begins with a general framework for explaining fertil-&#13;
ity trend in India. Inasmuch as this framework was developed largely on&#13;
the basis of the work done by the author on determinants of fertility&#13;
decline in Kerala,3/ this section gives a brief description of the Kerala&#13;
framework of fertiTity decline and its relevance in the Indian context.&#13;
The paper later proceeds to a description of fertility levels and trends by&#13;
states in India, and relates the Indian experience in fertility decline&#13;
with the world experience. This is followed by an analysis of the role of&#13;
the family planning program and increase in age at marriage in the decline&#13;
in fertility. The last section takes up the interstate variation and&#13;
socio-economic differentials in fertility and family planning practices and&#13;
examines the factors related to their differences in a multivariate&#13;
context.&#13;

II. Determinants of Fertility Decline - A General Framework&#13;
In a recent reappraisal of theories of fertility decline, Ronald&#13;
Freedman4/ has suggested that for less developed countries today,&#13;
motivation for fertility decline can arise from fewer changes than those&#13;
that characterized the West. Under modern conditions, ideas and aspiration&#13;
for a different way of life are also important in motivating lower&#13;
fertility. The concept and means of family limitation within marriage&#13;
produce an independent effect on fertility decline, once motivation is&#13;
present.&#13;
The author's analysis of fertility decline in Kerala suggests that&#13;
the concept and means of family planning have independent effects on&#13;
fertility decline not only when motivation is present, but also when the&#13;
motivation is weak or even absent. Official intervention in population&#13;
matters is a relatively new phenomenon. This has altered somewhat the&#13;
pattern of fertility decline and its relationship with socio-economic&#13;
factors. In evaluating the determinants of fertility decline in India, it&#13;
is necessary to take into consideration not only the socio-economic factors&#13;
which are involved in demographic transition, but also this new element of&#13;
official involvement and financial incentive for family planning practice.&#13;
Emperical support for such a reappraisal of the demographic transition&#13;
theory is given by the Kerala study.&#13;
Kerala Framework of Fertility Decline5/&#13;
Kerala has experienced an unexpectedly rapid decline in fertility&#13;
under seemingly unfavorable circumstances--low per capita income, low&#13;
degree of urbanization, industrialization, etc. At the same time, the&#13;
population is well-developed with respect to education and mortality&#13;
decline, two very important factors in the classical transition theory.&#13;
The theoretical framework assumed to explain fertility decline in Kerala&#13;
includes not only these elements from the transition theory but also the&#13;
new element of the influence of state policies and programs on fertility.&#13;
The fertility decline in Kerala was assumed to be a result of historical&#13;
developments as well as recent policy interventions.&#13;
Historical developments eroded the economic value of inherited&#13;
characteristics (caste, religion, etc.) and inherited wealth (land), and&#13;
enhanced the economic value of personal characteristics (education and&#13;
health). Fueled by inter-communal rivalry in developing human capital, the&#13;
State experienced a sharp decline in mortality and an accelerated&#13;
improvement in educational attainment. The low mortality conditions and&#13;
high educational attainment provided the necessary milieu for a fertility&#13;
decline. The low mortality enabled couples to attain their desired&#13;
(surviving) family size with fewer children ever-born. The high&#13;
educational attainment enabled parents to make rational decisions about&#13;

family size, taking into consideration mortality risks and their given&#13;
socio-economic perspective; it enabled couples to utilize family planning&#13;
services effectively and limit or postpone births as and when they feel&#13;
desirable; it increased the cost of bringing up children as education&#13;
became a necessity for economic survival, it increased the opportunity&#13;
costs of women and reduced the economic benefits from children; and it&#13;
increased the risk of unemployment especially at critical younger ages.&#13;
While these long-term socio-economic changes produced the&#13;
necessary milieu and caused the age at marriage to increase, the sharp&#13;
decline in marital fertility was precipitated by more recent policy&#13;
interventions--land reforms, agrarian reforms, and the official family&#13;
planning program in particular.&#13;
The land reforms and other redistributive policies operated on&#13;
fertility in different ways. The economic realignment has caused some&#13;
socio-economic groups to suffer loss of land, status, income, etc., with no&#13;
hope of immediate recovery, forcing them to make demographic adjustments&#13;
toward later marriages and fewer children. The increase in wages decreased&#13;
the income of land owners, even those who have not lost any land, forcing&#13;
them also to adopt fertility control. Wage increases boosted the cash&#13;
income of female daily wage earners, raising the opportunity cost of their&#13;
time spent in bringing up children. The increase in wages also reduced&#13;
employment opportunities, forcing children out of the job market and making&#13;
them economically less valuable. Even the hutment dwellers who undoubtedly&#13;
gained by the land reforms and wage legislation began to feel the need for&#13;
birth control, as their children found it impossible to obtain a place for&#13;
a hut of their own.&#13;
The official family planning program came at an opportune time to&#13;
serve the manifest demand, strengthen the latent demand, and create new&#13;
demand for birth control, especially among the poor.&#13;
Applicability of Kerala Framework to other States of India&#13;
The socio-economic situation in the other states is somewhat&#13;
different from that in Kerala, and yet the fertility decline in these other&#13;
states can also be explained in the same general framework, namely:&#13;
- increase in cost of bringing up children in relation to the&#13;
benefits from them; and&#13;
- family planning education and services.&#13;
In Kerala, the cost increase came about because of increase in the&#13;
proportion of children surviving in a family, the economic necessity to&#13;
invest in children's education and health, and through a series of policies&#13;
related to land distribution, wages, etc. These changes are relevant in&#13;
the other states also, but the degree of change and their relative&#13;
importance vary significantly from state to state. It is our hypothesis&#13;
that interstate variation in the extent of fertility change in recent years&#13;
can be explained by the differences in the family planning program and in&#13;
the changes in the socio-economic factors which determines the cost of&#13;
bringing up children in these states. The principal among these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
socio-economic factors are mortality, education, agricultural density,&#13;
female wages, and land redistribution.&#13;
III. Fertility Trend in India by States&#13;
Fertility Trend in India. There is some uncertainty about the&#13;
fertility level and trend in India. Recent data are more reliable and they&#13;
indicate that the birth rate is about 34 and the total fertility rate is&#13;
about 4.8.&#13;
Working backwards on the basis of expected decline due to family&#13;
planning program and changes in proportion married, an estimate of 6.5 can&#13;
be taken as the TFR for India as a whole before 1960. These figures&#13;
indicate a fertility decline of 26 percent in recent years.&#13;
Substantial declines took place before and after 1971. Rough&#13;
estimates are: a decline of 0.8 in TFR before 1971 (12%) and a decline of&#13;
0.9 during 1971-81 (16%).&#13;
Since 1976 the decline in birth rate has slowed down. In fact,&#13;
birth rate seems to have stalled (Table 2 and Figure 1), although the&#13;
fertility rate continues to decline, but at a slower rate.&#13;
An approximate decomposition of the decline in birth rate during&#13;
1961-71 and 1971-81 is given Table 1:&#13;
Table 1:  Decomposition of birth Rate 1961-71 and 1971-81&#13;

3. Due to changes in marital&#13;

5. Due to fertility reduction&#13;
within marriage:                1.25 (31)      6.40 (106)     7.64 (76)&#13;
1/   4 = 44 - 40; 6 = 40 - 34; 10 = 44 - 34.&#13;
It shows that during 1961-81, the birth rate declined by about 10&#13;
points. Nearly three-fourths of this decline was due to declines in&#13;
marital fertility. The age-sex composition contributed 10 percent to the&#13;
decline and marital status composition 14 percent. Thus the three factors&#13;
reinforced each other.&#13;

This was however not the case in the most recent decade. In&#13;
1971-81 changes in age-sex distribution was highly unfavorable to a decline&#13;
in birth rate (i.e., the proportion of women in child bearing ages&#13;
increased). Had there been no change in marital status distribution and&#13;
marital fertility, the birth rate would have increased by 1.1 points&#13;
because of the age-structure effect. On the other hand, in the earlier&#13;
period, 1961-71, changes in age-sex composition were highly favorable to a&#13;
decline in the birth rate. Had there been no change in the marital status&#13;
and marital fertility the birth rate would still have declined by 2.1&#13;
points.&#13;
The shift in the direction between 1961-71 and 1971-81 is very&#13;
instructive. It shows that 1971-81 could be the beginning of a longer&#13;
period in which increasing proportion of women in child bearing ages would&#13;
tend to dampen the decline in the birth rate or make it increase even when&#13;
fertility falls. The "age effect" has to be much stronger towards the end&#13;
of the decade than in the beginning (evident from the change in the sign).&#13;
This is one explanation of the stalling of the Indian birth rate since 1976&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
However, this is not the only explanation. Although changes in marital&#13;
status composition do not seem to have been a factor in the stalling,&#13;
changes in the proportion of couples effectively protected by the official&#13;
family planning program was a major factor. Between 1970-71 and 1976-77&#13;
the proportion of couples effectively protected increased by 13 points, but&#13;
between 1976-77 and 1981-82 the proportion hardly changed at all (Table&#13;
10). Family planning use from non-official sources could have increased,&#13;
and it is likely that marital fertility continued to decrease slightly even&#13;
when the birth rate was stalling. Even otherwise, proportion married&#13;
continued to decrease at younger ages and TFR experienced some decrease.&#13;
Thus, increasing proportion of females in the prime fertile ages and the&#13;
decreasing demand for family planning services are the principal factors&#13;
underlying the stalling of the Indian birth rate since 1976.&#13;
Fertility Trend by States&#13;
The States are very heterogeneous with respect to levels and&#13;
trends in the birth rate. Table 3 indicates that in five of the major&#13;
states, the crude birth rate was below 30.1 These states are inhabited by&#13;
190 million people, more than the population of Indonesia. Such a&#13;
significant decline among such a large population is worth noting while&#13;
comparing the Indian family planning program with other countries in Asia.&#13;
Ten years ago there was no state in India with a birth rate below&#13;
30, and twenty years ago there was none with a birth rate below 35.&#13;
In comparison to these relatively successful states are several&#13;
other states, six among the major ones, with a combined population of 314&#13;
million and a birth rate above 35 even in 1982. These states have also&#13;
experienced some decline in the birth rate, but the effect of the family&#13;
planning program was not large enough to make a major impact on the birth&#13;
rate.&#13;
Table 4 gives the reported fertility rates by states in 1972 and&#13;
1978 for urban and rural areas separately. These rates are not very&#13;
accurate, but can be used for comparative purposes.6/ The heterogeneity&#13;
shown by the birth rate is also evident in the fertility rate, both in the&#13;
urban and rural areas.&#13;
There are a few other sources of fertility data for inter-state&#13;
comparison. These are from the 1971 and 1981 census. The principal&#13;
indices are child-women ratio (children 5-9 years/women 20-49 years) and&#13;
average number of children ever-born. On the basis of all these indices&#13;
an assessment of the relative ranks of the various states are made with&#13;
respect to (i) fertility level around 1980 (Column A below) and (ii)&#13;
fertility decline during 1970-80 (Column B below).&#13;
6/ Some of these rates are clearly underestimates although the number of&#13;
births used in the calculations are fairly accurate. The total marital&#13;
fertility rates (TMFKs) are more reliable.&#13;

Geographic Patterns: Fertility rates and birth rates are lower&#13;
in the southern States of India than in the northern States. In the north,&#13;
the central States have in general higher fertility rates than those in the&#13;
east or west (See Map 1).&#13;
Assuming that fertility rates were not very much different in the&#13;
past, the relatively lower rates in the south must imply a relatively more&#13;
rapid fertility decline in these states. The path of fertility decline in&#13;
India seems to follow the path of the south-west monsoon. The monsoon&#13;
reaches India first in Kerala and then spreads northwards. On the way, it&#13;
splits into two, covering northwest and northeast before reaching the north&#13;
central states, namely, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and&#13;
Rajasthan. These states are yet to experience a good shower of fertility&#13;
decline.&#13;
Indian Fertility in the International Context&#13;
Is a birth rate of 34 or a TFR of 4.8 too high, too low, or just&#13;
average for a population like India's? In one respect, this is a very low&#13;
level. When its development indicators are taken into consideration, there&#13;
is no other country in the world with a fertility rate lower than India's&#13;
(see Figures Al and A2 in the Annex). For example, at the level of income&#13;
per capita in India, the expected TFR is 5.8, but the rate for India is&#13;
4.8. Similarly, for its literacy rate, the expected TFK is 6.6, and for&#13;
its IMR the expected TFR is 6.1. Thus, with respect to each one of these&#13;
socio-economic indicators, the Indian fertility rate is lower than expected&#13;
on the basis of international or less developed country experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Not only that, at these levels of development, no other country&#13;
has a lower fertility rate. For example, there is no country with an IMR&#13;
higher than India's but fertility rate lower than India's.     Similarly there&#13;
is no country with a female literacy rate lower than India's, but with&#13;
lower TFK. Thus, the Indian fertility rate is relatively low when its&#13;
developmental indicators are taken into consideration. But this is hardly&#13;
comforting for the Indian planners. The Indian population growth rate is&#13;
too high from the point of the country's developmental needs.&#13;
Fertility Trend in India and Indonesia&#13;
One interesting comparison of Indian fertility trend is with the&#13;
Indonesian rates. As is shown in Figure II, demographic transitions in&#13;
India and Indonesia are practically indistinguishable. Fertility and&#13;
mortality decline in Indonesia are no higher than those in India during the&#13;
period 1960-8U, yet the family planning program in Indonesia is considered&#13;
to be a "success" while that in India is referred to as a "failure". In&#13;
this connection the following observation by McNicoll and Singarimbun7/ is&#13;
worth quoting:&#13;
It is a curious reflection on the capriciousness (or short&#13;
attention span) of the international population community that,&#13;
although Indonesia's demographic transition has roughly&#13;
paralleled India's over the last two decades (with East Java's&#13;
present fertility on a par with Kerala's or Tamil Nadu's),&#13;
Indonesia is hailed as a population policy success story while&#13;
India is typically portrayed as a failure. The demographic&#13;
similarity may well extend to the bases for some of the regional&#13;
fertility differentials: the likelihood that most other&#13;
Indonesian provinces will soon reach East Java's present&#13;
fertility level may be no greater than that of the northern&#13;
states of India soon reaching Kerala's.&#13;
The fact that the Indian fertility is not too high when its&#13;
socio-economic development is taken into consideration, or that the Indian&#13;
fertility decline has been as fast as that of Indonesia, which is hailed as&#13;
a success story with respect to its family planning program, do not&#13;
minimize the grave implications of the high fertility rate in India. The&#13;
fertility rate and the consequent rate of population growth are too high&#13;
from the point of the country's developmental needs.&#13;
The Indian population is growing at an unprecedented 15 million&#13;
per year, higher than in any other country in the world, including China.&#13;
The Indian rate of population growth has not declined a bit even after 30&#13;
years of family planning: the growth rate in 1971-81 was the same as that&#13;
in 1961-71. The demographic targets set by the Indian planners have rarely&#13;
been reached or even approached. The births in 1984 would be 6.3 million&#13;
more than the target (based on an actual rate of 34 and a target of 25 set&#13;
in 1973).&#13;
7/ Fertility Decline in Indonesia. Analyses and Interpretation Committee&#13;
on Population and Demography. Report No. 20. National Academy Press,&#13;
Washington, D.C., 1983, p. 112.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
The built-in momentum for population growth in India is such that&#13;
even if the impossible target of a replacement level fertility is reached&#13;
in 1984, the Indian population will grow Ly 80 percent.     In reality, it is&#13;
extremely difficult to contain the annual growth in India's population to&#13;
under 16 million per year through the remaining years of the century.&#13;
Thus, although the Indian fertility rate is not too high by&#13;
international standards, and is lower than that in any other country of&#13;
comparable socio-economic development, yet, because of the large base&#13;
population, high population density, and the need to develop fast from its&#13;
low level of development, the fertility rates in most states of India are&#13;
much too high and the need to accelerate the decline in the birth rate is&#13;
very urgent. For this purpose, we need to know what factors have caused&#13;
the fertility to fall in India, what are the reasons why the birth rate has&#13;
begun to stall, and what are the policy options at the disposal of the&#13;
planners to accelerate fertility decline. The remaining sections of the&#13;
paper are concerned with these questions.&#13;
IV. Proximate Determinants of Fertility&#13;
The principal proximate determinants of fertility are:&#13;
a. proportion married;&#13;
b. proportion using contraception;&#13;
c. rate of induced abortion; and&#13;
d. length of lactation infecundity period.&#13;
Although all four are important, we will take up only two of them, namely,&#13;
proportion married and proportion protected by contraception. Very little&#13;
reliable information is available at the national level on the trend in&#13;
either the number of induced abortions or the length of lactation&#13;
ammenorrhea. It is likely that the abortion rate would have increased and&#13;
lactation ammenorrhea decreased. The former would have decreased the&#13;
fertility rate and the latter would have increased it. Thus, their net&#13;
effect on fertility change is not likely to be very large.&#13;
Age at Marriage and Proportion Married&#13;
Age at marriage of females has been relatively very low in most&#13;
states of India and one of the reasons for the high fertility in the&#13;
country is that by the time a woman becomes old enough to recognize the&#13;
problems of a large family, she already has too many children; there is&#13;
little she can do at that stage.&#13;
The mean age at marriage of females in 1961, 1971 and 1981 is given&#13;
in Table 5. The singulate mean age at marriage for females was 18.3 years&#13;
in 1981 and 17.2 years in 1971, representing an increase of nearly one year&#13;
in the 10-year period. Similar increases took place in the previous&#13;
decade. Thus, the age at marriage in India is increasing, but slowly.&#13;

Proportion Married&#13;
For fertility trend, what matters most is the proportion of women&#13;
married in each age group. These proportions change not only due to change&#13;
in age at marriage, but also due to change in the age at which marriages&#13;
are dissolved.&#13;
Proportions married among females in 1961, 1971 and 1981 are given&#13;
in Table 6. They decrease at younger ages, 15-19 years and 20-24 years, as&#13;
a result of the increase in age at marriage. At the 1972 fertility rates,&#13;
these decreases in proportion married should result in a decrease in TFR by&#13;
0.198 between 1961 and 1971, by 0.143 between 1971 and 1981 and by 0.341&#13;
between 1961 and 1981. This decrease was partly compensated by increases&#13;
in proportion married at older ages which is a reflection of the increase&#13;
in the age at marriage dissolution, especially through widowhood. The&#13;
effect of this increase was an increase in the TFR by 0.119 during 1961-71,&#13;
0.047 during 1971-81 and 0.166 during 1961-81. The net effect of changes&#13;
in age at marriage formation and marriage dissolution was a decrease in TFR&#13;
of 0.079 during 1961-71, a decrease of 0.097 during 1971-81 and 0.176&#13;
during 1961-81 (Table 7). Thus, although increase in age at marriage has&#13;
been a factor in the fertility decline in India in recent years, part of&#13;
the effect of increase in age at marriage was nullified by the simultaneous&#13;
increase in the age at widowhood leaving only a relatively small net&#13;
decrease in fertility due to marital factors.&#13;
Results of the calculations done at the state level is given in&#13;
Table 8. The highest impact was in Punjab where the TFR had declined by&#13;
0.295 during 1961-71 and 0.207 during 1971-81 due to marriage factor&#13;
alone. On the other hand, there are a number of other states, where the&#13;
effect is very negligible. In 1971-81 Kerala shows the lowest effect.&#13;
This can be explained in terms of the relatively very high average age at&#13;
marriage in Kerala in 1971.&#13;
Family Planning Program&#13;
The Indian Family Welfare Program has an excellent evaluation&#13;
program which collects and publishes service statistics. They include:&#13;
i) family planning acceptors by methods;&#13;
ii) cumulative acceptance of family planning by methods since the&#13;
inception of the program;&#13;
iii) couples currently and effectively protected by the various&#13;
family planning methods; and&#13;
iv) number of births averted.&#13;
These statistics (primary and derived) are found to be quite accurate as&#13;
ascertained by independent sample surveys in the various states by research&#13;
organizations and by the Operations Research Group (ORG) at the national&#13;
level. Selected family planning statistics for India and for the states&#13;
are given in the Annex Tables Al to A7.&#13;

Since the inception of the program, 36.2 million sterilizations&#13;
were performed (21.8 million vasectomies and 14.4 tubectomies); 9.5 million&#13;
IUD's were inserted and a large number of condoms and pills were&#13;
distributed. It is estimated that as a result of this program, 49.3&#13;
million births were averted and currently 24% of the eligible couples are&#13;
effectively protected.&#13;
An analysis done by the Director of Evaluation (Government of&#13;
India) concluded that the births averted by the program could account for&#13;
all the decline in the birth rates. If the pre-program birth rate was&#13;
about 45.0, the estimated rate in 1981-82 on the basis of the births&#13;
averted by the program would be 34.9 (1981-82); if the pre-program rate was&#13;
only 42.5, the 1982-83 rate would be 32.8. The SRS rate for that year was&#13;
33.2. Thus, the program could account for almost the entire decline in the&#13;
birth rate (Table 9).&#13;
In 1971-72, the proportion of couples effectively protected was&#13;
12.4 (Table 10). The fertility impact of such protection in terms of birth&#13;
rate was a reduction to a level of about 38.4 (Table 9). The effect on TFR&#13;
was a reduction of 0.79 of a child per woman (Table 13). By 1981-82 the&#13;
proportion of couples protected increased to 23.7. The additional&#13;
reduction in the birth rate during 1971-81 due to family planning program&#13;
was 3.5 points. The effect on TFR was 0.8 of a child per woman (Table 13).&#13;
We have seen that the fertility effect of increase in age at&#13;
marriage during 1971-81 was about 0.1. Thus, a rough estimate of the&#13;
relative contribution of family planning in the fertility decline during&#13;
1971-81 would be 89%; the other 11% can be attributable to changes in&#13;
proportion married.&#13;
Interstate Variation&#13;
As could be expected from the interstate variation in fertility&#13;
rates, family planning performance varies considerbly from state to state&#13;
(Table 11). By far the best performance was in Maharashtra where both the&#13;
cumulative sterilization rate (492 per 1,000 married women aged 15-44) and&#13;
percent of couples protected were the highest (37%). At the other extreme&#13;
is Uttar Pradesh with a cumulative sterilization rate of only 128 per 1,000&#13;
married women aged 15-44 and a protection rate of 11%.&#13;
The state-wise impact of the program on birth rate and TFR was&#13;
not readily available in published reports. An approximate estimate was&#13;
obtained using the regression relation between percent of couples protected&#13;
in a year (in India) and the corresponding expected program birth rate.&#13;
The results are shown in Table 12.    In some states the observed decline in&#13;
the birth rate was close to that estimated on the basis of couples&#13;
protected (e.g. Kerala, Maharashtra) while in others they are very much&#13;
different, (e.g., Assam). The disagreement between the two sets need not&#13;
be due to errors in estimated births averted or in percent of couples&#13;
protected.   It can as well arise from errors in the birth rate, especially&#13;
the rate in the earlier of the two years. This is likely to be the main&#13;
reason for the large difference in Assam.&#13;

In Gujarat, Maharashtra, and haryana the TFR decline by more than&#13;
two children per woman during 1961-81.    Next in order comes Kerala, Andhra&#13;
Pradesh, Punjab and Karnataka.    Fertility decline due to family planning&#13;
was least in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Bihar. On the whole&#13;
fertility decline since 1971 was slightly higher tiian that before 1971.&#13;
This was true in all states except Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir.&#13;
Table 14 gives the combined effect of contraceptive practice and&#13;
changes in marital status distribution. It also gives the contribution of&#13;
family planning to the combined total. In 1971-81, the relative&#13;
contribution of family planning varied from 89 percent in Andra Pradesh and&#13;
Tamil Nadu to 65 percent in Punjab. Between the two periods 1961-71 and&#13;
1971-81, the percent contributea by family planning has decline in most&#13;
states. This was not due to an absolute decline, but more due to a&#13;
relatively larger increase in the contribution of the nuptiality factor.&#13;

Characteristics of Family Planning Acceptors&#13;
The effectiveness of family planning practice depends not only on&#13;
the number of persons who practice, but also on the characteristics of the&#13;
acceptors, especially their age distribution and parity.&#13;
The majority of the family planning acceptors are in their&#13;
thirties; nearly a third are in the age group 30-34 years. More than 80% of&#13;
the acceptors are in the age group 25-39 years. The average age of&#13;
acceptors was 31.6 in 1973-74 but decreased to 30.5 by 1980-81. Thus, over&#13;
the years, the average age has decreased somewhat, indicating that the&#13;
fertility impact of family planning acceptance has increased.&#13;
By the time an average Indian woman reaches 30 to 35 years, she&#13;
already has produced most of her children. The average number of living&#13;
children at the time of acceptance was more than 3.5 for acceptors of&#13;
sterilization. This is the average desired number of children as expressed&#13;
by women in most of the surveys conducted in India in recent years. Thus&#13;
when couples in India accept terminal methods of family planning they have&#13;
achieved or surpassed their desired family size.&#13;

V. Socio-Economic Factors Related to Fertility Decline&#13;
The previous section has shown that much of the fertility decline&#13;
in India in recent years (as much as 89% in 1971-81) was due to the&#13;
increased contraceptive practice. States which have shown a high accep-&#13;
tance rate have experienced high fertility decline also. As a result, the&#13;
factors underlying fertilty decline in India are to a large extent the&#13;
factors which determine contraceptive practice. In this section, there-&#13;
fore, we begin with an analysis of the factors related to the interstate&#13;
differences in family planning practice.&#13;
Family Planning&#13;
Family planning acceptance rate varies considerably by&#13;
socio-economic factors. It is higher in the urban areas than in the rural&#13;
areas, higher among the Hindus than among the Muslims, etc.&#13;
Factors related to family planning use are analysed in a&#13;
multivariate context using two measures of family planning performance.&#13;
They are:&#13;
i. percent of couples effectively protected, 1981-82&#13;
ii.  cumulative equivalent sterilization up to 1982 per 10UU&#13;
population&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
A simple regression between percent of couples effectively&#13;
protected in 1981-82 and program variables indicated that expenditure on&#13;
family welfare in 1981 can explain 32 percent of the variance. Other input&#13;
variables are highly correlated with expenditure and did not add much to&#13;
the total variance explained.&#13;
Dependent variable: percent couples effectively&#13;
protected in 1981-82&#13;
Independent Variables                  B     F Ratio      R2&#13;
1. Expenditure on F.W. (1980-81)&#13;
per capita                           +.636     6.4      32.1&#13;
2. Field workers (1981-82)&#13;
per capita                           -.418     0.4       2.0&#13;
TOTAL      34.1&#13;
When socio-economic variables alone were used in the regression,&#13;
the total explained variance increased to 74.0 percent. The variables&#13;
which had statistically significant association are:&#13;
- female literacy&#13;
- per capita domestic product of the state&#13;
- female agricultural wages&#13;
Additional variables added little to the total explained variance. The&#13;
results of the regression are shown below:&#13;
Dependent variable: percent couples effectively&#13;
protected in 1981-82&#13;
Independent Variables                  b    F Ratio      K2&#13;
1. Female literacy rate 1971             +.67b    17.0     48.0&#13;
2. Per capita domestic product 1970-71 +.376       5.7      12.4&#13;
3. Female agricultural wages 74-75       -.391     6.4      13.6&#13;
4.  Per capita cropped area 197U-71      +.1409    0.5       0.0&#13;
TOTAL     74.0&#13;
Female literacy has the highest explanatory power. The&#13;
association is positive; that is, the higher the literacy rate in a state&#13;
the higher is its proportion of couples effectively protected. There is a&#13;
similar relationship with the per capita domestic product of the state.&#13;
In the conceptual framework, we put forth the hypothesis that one&#13;
of the reasons why women accept family planning is because their wages have&#13;
gone up and therefore their opportunity cost has also increased. We should&#13;
therefore expect a positive association between wages and family planning&#13;
acceptance. The data shows the opposite pattern; there is a negative&#13;
relationship between the proportion of couples effectively protected and&#13;
female agricultural wages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
When family planning program variables and socio-economic&#13;
variables are both introduced in the regression, the total variance&#13;
explained was 83.5. Taking all the three analyses together, we can draw&#13;
the following conclusions:&#13;
- Socio-economic variables have a relatively higher impact on&#13;
the use of family planning methods. The independent contribution&#13;
of socio-economic variables was 59 percent of the explained&#13;
variance of 83.5 percent.&#13;
- Family planning expenditure has a statistically significant&#13;
independent effect on family planning use. Their independent&#13;
contribution was 11 percent of the explained variance.&#13;
- The interaction between socio-economic variables and family&#13;
planning variables was quite substantial, as much as 3) percent&#13;
of the explained variance.&#13;
Cumulative Sterilization Rate&#13;
The cumulative sterilization rate is a fairly good index of the&#13;
overall effectiveness of the program from its very beginning. This rate is&#13;
regressed against program and socio-economic variables (average for the&#13;
decade 1971-81). The conclusions are more or less the same.&#13;
Among the program variables, expenditure on family welfare (per&#13;
capita) is the one which has the highest correlation. All the other&#13;
variables are highly correlated to the expenditure variable.&#13;
Among the socio-economic variables three showed statistically&#13;
significant association. They are the same (dates different) as those&#13;
which showed significant association with proportion of couples effectively&#13;
protected, namely:&#13;
- average literacy rate, 1971-81&#13;
- average domestic product per capita, 1971-81&#13;
- average female agricultural wages 1964-74&#13;
The results of the regression are shown in Table 17. This table also shows&#13;
that socio-economic variables played a more significant role than the&#13;
family planning input variables. An approximate descomposition is:&#13;
socio-economic variables 54 percent, family planning variables 15 percent,&#13;
and interaction between socio-economic and family planning variables 31&#13;
percent.&#13;
Fertility&#13;
Although much of the fertility trend and differentials could be&#13;
accounted for by the family planning program acceptance rate, since the&#13;
latter is highly associated with socio-economic conditions, we should&#13;
expect statistically significant relationships between fertility and&#13;
socio-economic variables. In the conceptual framework described earlier,&#13;
the principal socio-economic variables enumerated are mortality, education,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
agricultural density, female wages and land redistribution. We have no&#13;
useable data on land redistribution. We shall take up other factors one by&#13;
one and examine how they are related to fertility level and trend. We will&#13;
begin with a discussion of education.&#13;
Education&#13;
In general, educated women have fewer children than the&#13;
illiterate. The lndian data support this negative relationship between&#13;
fertility and years of schooling as shown in Tables 18, 19 and 20. In&#13;
1972, the difference in TFR between the least educated and the&#13;
most-educated was 1.8 in urban areas and 1.9 in rural areas. By 1978,&#13;
these differences had decreased to U.92 in urban areas and 0.81 in rural&#13;
areas. Fertility decline in India during 1972-78 was stronger among the&#13;
illiterate women than among the matriculates.&#13;
Annex tables A.11 and A.12 give similar relationships at the&#13;
state level. In all the states both in rural and urban areas there is a&#13;
general negative relationship between years of schooling and the level of&#13;
fertility. There are, however, a tew breaks in the regularity of the&#13;
pattern. In a few instances, the marital fertility among the illiterates&#13;
is lower than that among the literates with less than primary education,&#13;
e.g., Assam, Bihar, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka. Similarly, in a few&#13;
cases, women with primary education (less than matriculate) have higher&#13;
fertility than women with less than primary education, e.g. Gujarat,&#13;
Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka and Kerala. On the whole, such irregularities&#13;
are exceptions.&#13;
One reason for the observed higher fertility among women with&#13;
less than primary education compared to the illiterate is the deficiency of&#13;
the data (illiterates under-reporting births more than the literates). But&#13;
this need not be the case always. The fertility rate of literates or those&#13;
with primary education could as well be higher than those of the&#13;
illiterates. Such patterns are observed in other studies in India and&#13;
elsewhere.&#13;
The negative relationship between fertility and education is not&#13;
evident in all age specific fertility rates, but is confined to ages above&#13;
30 years (Table 19 and 20) . At younger ages, the fertility of more&#13;
educated women is even higher, due evidently to their higher age at&#13;
marriage and shorter duration of marriage.&#13;
Regression Analyses&#13;
Macro-analysis of the relationship between educational attainment&#13;
and fertility at the state level using regression technique gives&#13;
statistically significant negative relationship. The 1978 TFR and literacy&#13;
rate of 1971 gives a zero-order correlation coefficient of -.759 which is&#13;
statistically significant. When controlled for other variables, the total&#13;
variance explained by the regression was 90.5 of which 57.5 (63%) was&#13;
explained by literacy. The other variables which showed significant&#13;
association were per capita female agricultural wages, infant mortality,&#13;
and agricultural density (per capita cropped area).&#13;

Literacy was also regressed against decline in TFK between 1972&#13;
and 1978. The zero-order correlation was -0.279 which was not&#13;
statistically significant. When all the variables were included in the&#13;
regression, the total variance explained was 63.1 of which only 0.08 was&#13;
explained by literacy. None of the regression coefficients was&#13;
significant.&#13;
Thus, although fertility level is closely associated with&#13;
literacy, recent change is not very much related to the literacy level of&#13;
the state.&#13;

Mortality. Mortality decline, especially infant and child&#13;
mortality decline, has a depressing effect on fertility in more ways than&#13;
one:&#13;
-    through the biological effect on interval between births;&#13;
and&#13;
-    through behavioral effect prompted by increase in the&#13;
proportion of children surviving and consequent pressure on&#13;
household resources.&#13;
Statewise data on IMR in 1978 indicates that states with higher&#13;
IMR have, on the whole, a higher fertility rate also. Both in the rural&#13;
and urban areas, lower IMRs are associated with lower TFRs.&#13;

Regressions based on statewise data indicate a zero-order&#13;
correlation of +0.7U9, confirming the results from the cross-tabulation.&#13;
When other variables were introduced, the regression coefficient became&#13;
+0.542. IM accounted for 16% of the total explained variance.&#13;
As in the case of literacy, the association between IMR and&#13;
fertility decline was weaker than that between IMR and fertility level.&#13;
The zero-order correlation was +0.194 and the partial regression was&#13;
-0.191. None of the regression coefficients was statistically significant.&#13;
IMR and literacy rate are highly correlated (-.491). When IMR&#13;
and literacy are introduced in a step-wise regression, the regression&#13;
coefficients of literacy and IMR remained statistically significant. The&#13;
total variance explained by these two variables was 72.3. Both the&#13;
coefficient and the F ratio of literacy were higher. While literacy has&#13;
both a direct effect on fertility and an indirect effect through IMR, the&#13;
latter's influence on fertility through literacy cannot be that important.&#13;
A similar analysis conducted on change in fertility during the&#13;
period 1972-78 indicated that neither literacy nor IMR is statistically&#13;
significant.&#13;
Female Wages.&#13;
In the conceptual framework described earlier, employment of&#13;
females and their wage rates are important factors which determine&#13;
fertility through a woman's opportunity cost and her status in the&#13;
household. The higher the average female wages, the lower should be the&#13;
fertility rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
The zero-order correlation between the 1978 TFR and female&#13;
agricultural wages was -0.085 and that between change in TFR (1972-78) and&#13;
agricultural wages was -0.531. The relationship between TFR in 1978 and&#13;
female agricultural wages was not statistically significant. However, when&#13;
other socio-economic variables were introduced the relationship became&#13;
significant with a B-coefficient of +0.4025 and an F ratio of 8.5.&#13;
However, the sign was not in the expected direction. States with higher&#13;
female wages tend to have higher fertility.     A similar conclusion was&#13;
reached when the relation between female wages and family planning practice&#13;
was analysed.&#13;
As mentioned above, the zero-order correlation between fertility&#13;
decline (1972-78) and female agricultural wages was -0.531 which was&#13;
statistically significant. This again is contrary to our hypothesis of a&#13;
faster decline in fertility where the agricultural wages are higher.&#13;
However, when other variables are introduced the statistical significance&#13;
disappears.&#13;
Thus, the data do not support the hypothesis that increased&#13;
female agricultural wages have played a role in the recent fertility&#13;
decline.&#13;
Other Variables&#13;
The zero-order correlation coefficient between per capita cropped&#13;
area and the 1978 TFR was positive (0.537) and statistically significant,&#13;
and remains significant when other socio-economic variables are introduced&#13;
in the equation. In the case of per capita net domestic product, neither&#13;
the zero-order correlation nor the partial regression was statistically&#13;
significant.&#13;
Thus the empirical analysis supports only part of our&#13;
hypothesis. On the basis of our conceptual framework we were expecting a&#13;
strong positive association between education and family planning use, a&#13;
strong negative association between education and fertility rate. This is&#13;
supported out by the state-wise data as well as other micro-studies in&#13;
India. We were also expecting a strong negative association between infant&#13;
mortality and fertility and strong negative relationship between mortality&#13;
and family planning use. The data support the negative association between&#13;
fertility and IMR, but that with family planning is very weak. The&#13;
state-wise data also support the hypothesis regarding a positive&#13;
association between agricultural density and fertility. Contrary to our&#13;
expectation, female agricultural wages in a state were negatively related&#13;
to family planning use.&#13;

            Determinants of fertility decline in India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Indian fertility has declined by at
            least 25 percent in the last twenty years. The current total
            fertility rate is 4.8%, which is lower than that in any
            other country at the same or a lower level of socioeconomic
            development, as measured by per capita income, infant
            mortality, female education, and the like. Nearly 90 percent
            of the fertility decline in the period 1961-81 can be
            accounted for by the increase in family planning practice,
            and the balance by an increase in the age at marriage. The
            authors interpretation of the extent, pattern, and
            socioeconomic correlates of fertility decline in India is
            that, in the changing socioeconomic situation, the increase
            in the cost of bringing up children creates a situation in
            which a smaller family size is becoming an economic
            necessity to an increasing number of couples. The family
            planning program served not only this emerging demand for
            small families, but created additional demand for
            contraception through information and incentives.
