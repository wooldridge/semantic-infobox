1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. HEALTH STATUS&#13;
1. 1       In certain respects, the health issues confrontinig the Russian population are similar to those&#13;
found in other industrialized countries.  Like other countries which have progressed through the&#13;
epidemiological transition, the major health problems are related to chronic, non-infectious diseases and&#13;
traumas. However, in sharp conitrast with patterns in almost all developed and developing countries, the&#13;
health status of the Russian populationi is worsening. This deterioration is perhaps most visibly reflected&#13;
in the alarming trend in life expectancy.&#13;
Life Expectantcy&#13;
1.2        Until the mid-1960s, health status and life expectanicy in Russia were roughily comparable to&#13;
the rest of Europe. However, life expectancy stagnated through the ntext two and a half decades, then&#13;
wenlt into sudden declinie with the social upheavals ot the 1990s. Froml 1990 to 1994, life expectancy for&#13;
men declined from 63.9 years to 58.2 years and for woienii fronm 74.4 years to 71.6 years. The 13-year&#13;
gap between male and femiale life expectancy is the largest anywhere in the world. Men are two and a&#13;
half times as likely as women to die at an economically productive age.&#13;
Table 1.1: Life Expectancy at Birth (in years)&#13;
1965        1 98(       199(         1991         1992        1993        1994&#13;
Men             64.3        61.5         63.9         63.5        62.0         58.9        58.2&#13;
Women           73.4         73.1        74.4         74.3        73.8         71.9        71.6&#13;
Adult Healtht&#13;
1.3       In 1993, the leading causes of death in Russia were cardiovascular disease (52 percelnt),&#13;
trauma and poisoning (16 percent) and cancer (13 percent). Infectious diseases accounted for only about&#13;
I percent of deaths. Over the past 30 years, mortality from infectious diseases has fallen steadily, while&#13;
deaths from cardiovascular disease have nearly doubled.  This pattcrni differs markedfly from  that in&#13;
Western Europe, Japan and North America, where mortality rates fromii cardiovascular disease declined&#13;
by 35 to 50 percent during the same period. More recently, there hias also been a dramatic increase in&#13;
deaths due to trauma and poisoninig. In 1992, the sinigle most signiiicanit cause of death in this category,&#13;
responsible for 18 percent of such deaths, was su:cide. Another 13 percent were murders and a further&#13;
10 percent were due to alcohol poisoning. This pattern strongly suggests a population unable to cope&#13;
with the stresses of the transition.&#13;
1.4        Both morbidity and mortality reflect distinot gender patterns. In 1992, for example, the&#13;
incidence of cancer in men was 1.8 times as high as in women, with lung cancer accounting for 30&#13;
percent of all cases. The most common form of cancer in women, accounting for 17 percent of cases,&#13;
was breast cancer. At comparable ages, men are over twice as likely to die from cancer as women, three&#13;
times as likely to die from respiratory diseases, andl five times as likely to die from trauma and poisoning.&#13;

Maternal and Child Health&#13;
1.5       The declines in life expectancy also reflect a worsening in infant mortality. Infant mortality,&#13;
which dropped from 22.0 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 17.4 in 1990, rose to 19.9 in 1993, before&#13;
declining to 18.6 in 1994. This rate is two to three times as high as in OECD countries. Maternal&#13;
mortality, at 52 per 100,000 live births (1993), is five to ten times as high as in other industrialized&#13;
countries. The main causes are complications from abortions, post-partum bleeding and toxemia.&#13;
Contraceptive prevalence is low. The official rate for modern methods was 22.8 percent in 1993.&#13;
Although rates of over 40 percent have been reported, these include a high proportion, perhaps as much&#13;
as half, of non-modern methods (e.g., rhythm, withdrawal). This low rate of contraceptive use is&#13;
compensated for by reliance on abortion; in Russia, there are more than two abortions per live birth.&#13;
Maternal health is further complicated by high rates of anemia.&#13;
1.6       Children also suffer from anemia. A recent survey found the prevalence of anemia for&#13;
children under age two at between 10 and 15 percent in major cities and at about 25 percent in the&#13;
surrounding oblasts. Immunization rates ranging from 60 to 80 percent are fairly comparable to those&#13;
in other industrialized countries. The availability of vaccines is not a major problem in Russia, as, in&#13;
the past, Russia was the main source of vaccines for all of the USSR. Children who survive to their first&#13;
birthday are likely to reach adulthood, but then have a one in four chance of dying before age 60.&#13;
Demographic Crisis&#13;
1.7       The convergence of increased mortality and declining birth rates since 1988 has led to what&#13;
Russian health officials speak of as the "demographic crisis."  In fact, this issue is highlighted as the&#13;
most significant concern in the 1992 "State Report on the Status of Health of the Population in the&#13;
Russian Federation" (1992 State Report).&#13;

Risk Factors&#13;
1.8       The main risk factors in terms of adult health are alcohol, tobacco and diet. Among the&#13;
republics of the Former Soviet Union (FSU), Russia is second only to Belarus in per capita consumption&#13;
of alcohol. Recent surveys indicate a dramatic increase (over 100 percent) in the quantity of alcohol&#13;
consumed by male drinkers during the period September 1992 to December 1994, while alcohol&#13;
consumption by female drinkers increased only slightly.&#13;
&#13;

Introduction                                                                                    Page 3&#13;
1.9        Smoking is very prevalent in Russia, with approximately 60 percent of adult men and 15&#13;
percent of adult women smoking. The difference in smoking prevalence is a major factor contributing&#13;
to the gender patterns in morbidity and mortality. While male smoking trends have remained stable at&#13;
fairly high levels, the prevalence of smoking among women, particularly young women, is increasing and&#13;
will undoubtedly be reflected in health status in the future.&#13;
1.10       Household surveys reveal a marked change in diet between 1989 and 1992, including&#13;
significant decreases in the consumption of fruits and vegetables, fish, meat and milk and dairy products,&#13;
and sharp increases in the consumption of bread and potatoes. These changes were, in part, beneficial.&#13;
Prior to 1989, fat consumption was 10 to 15 percent higher than the recommended levels, while by 1992&#13;
calories from fat represented 31 percent of daily caloric intake, although a high proportion still comes&#13;
from animal fats. Undernutrition is not a significant problem; however, the prevalence of obesity is high,&#13;
particularly among women, and contributes to the high incidence of cardiovascular disease.&#13;
1.11       Adult morbidity and mortality are adversely affected by unhealthful and often dangerous&#13;
working conditions. Industrial pollution is also a significant problem, leading to regional variations in&#13;
respiratory diseases and various forms of cancer, although hard data linking causes and effects are not&#13;
readily available. Similarly, high levels of radiation resulting from nuclear accidents require long-term&#13;
epidemiological monitoring.&#13;
B. ORGANIZATION OF HEALTH SERVICES&#13;
1.12       The Russian health care system  as it now exists reflects both the positive and negative&#13;
attributes of the Soviet system from which it evolved. On the positive side, access is universal and the&#13;
system  is extensive.  On the negative side, the system  is not sufficiently funded to support the&#13;
comprehensive service it attempts to provide, and the quality of care suffers as a consequence.&#13;
Furthermore, the theoretical universality of access is seriously compromised, with marked inequities in&#13;
real access, particularly to better quality or highly-specialized services, among regions and among various&#13;
social and economic groups.&#13;
1.13       The public health system in Russia comprises 12,000 hospitals and maternity homes (2.8&#13;
million beds), 15,500 polyclinics and women's consultations, and 3,500 ambulatories. There are 48&#13;
medical academies, 117 research institutes and 34 major diagnostic centers. In parallel, some 600&#13;
hospitals and 1,700 outpatient clinics are operated under the auspices of the Ministries of Defense,&#13;
Interior, and Railways and other ministries and agencies. Large enterprises may also operate their own&#13;
health care facilities for the benefit of their employees and (sometimes) families and residents of the&#13;
immediate community. Facilities in this "parallel system" are often superior to public facilities because&#13;
they are better financed.&#13;
1.14       Since 1992, provision and financing (see next section) of health care have been decentralized&#13;
to the oblasts1'. At the oblast level, a typical health care system would comprise a central oblast hospital&#13;
(a tertiary-level general hospital with perhaps 1,000 beds, usually the best equipped, staffed and financed&#13;
facility in the oblast), several specialty hospitals, e.g., pediatric, emergency, psychiatric, tuberculosis,&#13;
I'  Here and in the rest of this document, the term oblast is used interchangeably with the more accurate term for the second&#13;
administrative level in the Federation: "subjects of the Federation" (i.e., Republics, krai, oblasts, and the cities of Moscow&#13;
and St. Petersburg). The term "region" is also sometimes used to refer to this level. The rayon is the administrative level&#13;
next down from the oblast.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4                                                                                     Introduction&#13;
one or two maternity homes, several free-standing polyclinics, one of which might be attached to and&#13;
serve as the outpatient department for the central oblast hospital. Each rayon typically has a central rayon&#13;
hospital (200 to 300 beds) with attached polyclinic and possibly a maternity home, one or more district&#13;
hospitals (25 to 50 beds), one or more ambulatories (small polyclinics) and numerous feldsher stations&#13;
(primary health care facilities usually staffed by medical personnel known as feldshers, whose level of&#13;
training falls between that of a nurse and a physician).&#13;
1.15       Although the vast majority of health services are provided by the public system at the oblast&#13;
level and below and the parallel system, there is a thin layer of federally financed health facilities.&#13;
Federal institutions are generally highly specialized health facilities, often associated with research&#13;
institutes, and account for less than 2 percent of inpatient admissions and 1 percent of outpatients treated.&#13;
Health promotion is the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Health (MOH)1' and the State&#13;
Committee on Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance (SCSES) within the MOH. The latter has broad&#13;
public health responsibilities in sanitation, hygiene, epidemiology and some aspects of environmental&#13;
protection.&#13;
1.16       The number and capacity of health care facilities is not only adequate, but excessive.&#13;
Hospital beds-to-population and physician-to-population ratios are much higher than in OECD countries,&#13;
as are lengths of stay and admission rates. In recent years, there has been a gradual reduction in the&#13;
number of hospital beds, and in 1992 the MOH reduced the intake of new students into medical&#13;
academies by 27 percent. However, given the large stock of physicians already in the system, it will take&#13;
considerable time before this intervention has a significant impact on the total number of physicians.&#13;

which does not contain categories included in the Russian definition. such as inactive physicians, dentists, sanitary-epidemiological physicians&#13;
and physiotherapists.&#13;
1.17       While physical capacity is in excess, quality is an entirely different matter. The 1992 State&#13;
Report indicates that 23 percent of hospitals have no running water; 33 percent have no sewerage system;&#13;
60 percent do not have hot running water; 23 percent of buildings need major repairs; and 2 percent are&#13;
considered unsafe. The state of equipment in health facilities is equally appalling. Much of the&#13;
equipment is run-down, out-of-date, or unusable for lack of spare parts. Most facilities make heroic&#13;
efforts to maintain their equipment, often cannibalizing other pieces for spare parts. However, budget&#13;
shortages for maintenance or new investment are chronic and these efforts eventually become futile.&#13;

C. HEALTH CARE AND MEDICAL PRACTICE&#13;
1.18      Health care in Russia is characterized by excessive reliance on curative and inpatient care.&#13;
Although there is a strong tradition of preventive medicine, the evolution from prevention of&#13;
communicable disease (e.g., through immunization and infection control) to non-communicable disease&#13;
(e.g., through changes in lifestyles) has not kept pace with the epidemiological transition in the country.&#13;
The preference for specialist and inpatient care, still considered to represent better quality medicine,&#13;
generates a self-perpetuating system where the better medical students specialize, upward referral by&#13;
primary caregivers is almost automatic, and diagnostic capacity is concentrated in hospitals, which get&#13;
preference in allocation of investment and recurrent budgets. This penchant for specialization results in&#13;
medical practice that is extremely fragmented and compartmentalized with little cross-referral among&#13;
specialties and much duplication of services. This fragmentation leads to longer hospital stays and&#13;
generally results in poor patient care.&#13;
1.19      Medical practice is dominated by a complex, inflexible, and often outdated set of norms and&#13;
standards covering a broad range of items from the management of specific medical conditions to&#13;
standards for the layout of rooms in hospitals. These norms and standards, which are strictly enforced&#13;
by the MOH or the SCSES, serve as the principal mechanism for quality "control" (backed by a strict&#13;
punitive system) leaving little room for professional judgement or accountability by individual&#13;
practitioners, their peers or their managers. There is little evidence that costs or affordability have been&#13;
factored into the norms and standards in application.&#13;
1.20      The ultimate result of the current culture of care is a highly cost-ineffective, unresponsive&#13;
system unable to produce the maximum benefits possible from an already extremely limited resource&#13;
envelope.&#13;
D. HEALTH FINANCING&#13;
Sources of Financing&#13;
1.21      The Russian health care system is largely publicly funded. Until 1992, the main sources of&#13;
health financing were the federal budget and enterprises. Household expenditures for health were&#13;
minimal, mainly going to purchase of drugs for outpatient services. In 1992, responsibility for health&#13;
financing was decentralized to the oblasts. In 1993, a 3.6 percent payroll tax for compulsory health&#13;
insurance was introduced. The payroll tax is collected by a Territorial Health Insurance Fund (THIF)&#13;
at the oblast level which retains 3.4 percent, and remits 0.2 percent to the Federal Health Insurance Fund&#13;
(FHIF) which is responsible for oversight and for providing equalization payments to economically&#13;
disadvantaged oblasts.&#13;
1.22      Decentralization, the introduction of the payroll tax, and the entry of private insurers and&#13;
providers have radically changed the pattern of financing for health. Although data on the private sector&#13;
may not be completely accurate, it is estimated that private expenditures on health, by enterprises and&#13;
households combined, constituted 18 percent of total health expenditures in 1994. In the same year, 71&#13;
percent of total government expenditures for health were financed out of local (oblast and rayon) budgets,&#13;
and 18 percent out of THIF revenues. Only 10 percent of government health expenditures came from&#13;
the federal budget.&#13;

1.23    As enterprises are privatized, many of them are choosing to shed the responsibility for social&#13;
services they provide. By 1994, enterprise spending on social services was estimated to have dropped&#13;
to less than half the 1992 level in real terms. However, most of the parallel system of health facilities&#13;
are related to government agencies or ministries (e.g., Ministry of Railways) and are not affected by&#13;
privatization.&#13;
1.24    The majority of household spending on health is for outpatient pharmaceuticals. Certain&#13;
categories of patients receive free or subsidized pharmaceuticals. These include diabetics, epileptics,&#13;
psychotics, veterans, pensioners and very young children. Inpatient pharmaceuticals, to the extent they&#13;
are available, are provided to patients free of charge. As from January 1, 1994, all price controls on&#13;
pharmaceuticals have been removed. Most manufacturers have been privatized and private distributors&#13;
and retail outlets have been allowed to enter the market. Because prices at the retail level now reflect&#13;
market forces, prices are much higher than in the past, and affordability has become a significant issue,&#13;
both for individual consumers and inpatient health care facilities.&#13;
1.25    Although the private practice of medicine is now permitted, relatively little is being spent on&#13;
privately provided health care. The Russian Constitution adopted in December 1993 guarantees free&#13;
health care to all citizens. Current legislation only imprecisely defines the guaranteed package of&#13;
services. However, certain non-essential services, such as cosmetic surgery and, in some places, dental&#13;
services, are provided as "paid services. " In 1994, reported household expenditures on medical services&#13;
amounted to 2.9 percent of total health spending. This figure includes privately provided and "paid"&#13;
publicly provided health services. In addition, it is a widely held practice to offer gifts or gratuities to&#13;
providers in the public sector, with the value/amount of the gift varying with the nature of the service.&#13;
It is uncertain to what extent such gratuities are reported in the household expenditure data.&#13;

Introduction                                                                            Page 7&#13;
Health Expenditures&#13;
1.26    During the recent period of economic transition, the Government has made considerable efforts&#13;
to protect social expenditures. The level of health spending has been more or less preserved in real&#13;
terms. With real GDP declining, total health expenditures are estimated to have risen from 2.2 percent&#13;
of GDP in 1990 to 4.9 percent in 1994. Introduction of the earmarked payroll tax for health has been&#13;
an important factor in maintaining the level of health financing.&#13;
1.27    At 4.9 percent of GDP, health spending in Russia is slightly higher than the level that would&#13;
be expected for a country at its income level. However, it is substantially lower than in OECD countries&#13;
which Russia looks to as comparators. Per capita health expenditure in Russia in 1994 was estimated to&#13;
be $91 at market exchange rates or $261 adjusted for purchasing power parity (ppp), compared with the&#13;
OECD average of $1660 at market exchange rates and $1500 adjusted for ppp (1993 data). At this level&#13;
of expenditure, it would be difficult if not impossible for Russia to provide universal access to the&#13;
complete range of available medical technologies that it aims to offer its entire population.&#13;
1.28    Within this total resource envelope, the allocation of health sector resources is heavily skewed&#13;
toward hospitals and other inpatient facilities as illustrated by the following breakdown of expenditures&#13;
in 1991.&#13;

Although current national level information is not available, reports from the oblast level indicate that&#13;
the allocation for inpatient care has probably been maintained or even increased.&#13;
1.29    Since 1990, there has been a significant shift in the allocation of health spending by&#13;
category.&#13;

Wages and payroll taxes, which accounted for 50 percent or more of total health expenditures from&#13;
1960 through 1991, declined to 36 percent in 1993. This is because salaries have continued to be&#13;
controlled through a system of federal norms managed by the Ministry of Labor, and have not risen&#13;
as rapidly as other costs which have been subject to market forces. In fact, a physician's salary at&#13;
present is equivalent to about 70 percent of the wages earned by an industrial worker.&#13;
1.30    Physician remuneration is only part of a larger issue that lies at the heart of much of the&#13;
inefficiency in the health care system. Under the Soviet system, hospitals and polyclinics were paid on&#13;
the basis of fixed budgets that were determined largely by the facilities' staffing and infrastructure. In&#13;
turn, salaries, numbers of personnel, and numbers of beds were dictated by Federal quantitative input&#13;
norms which bore little relationship to service levels or the relative cost-effectiveness of various services.&#13;
The result of this payment system was constant pressure from facilities to expand capacity and a serious&#13;
lack of incentives to providers to either use resources efficiently or offer quality care.&#13;
E. REFORMS&#13;
1.31    In the late 1980s, dissatisfaction with the health system's performance led to a search for new&#13;
ways to organize and manage care. Three oblasts - St. Petersburg, Kemerovo, and Samara - were the&#13;
sites of experiments with a New Economic Mechanism that partially decentralized health care&#13;
management and introduced new payment mechanisms.  Instead of receiving budgets determined&#13;
principally by input levels, health facilities were paid on the basis of performance. Polyclinics became&#13;
"fundholders" responsible for managing a capitation-based allocation on behalf of the registered&#13;
population, in return for which they would guarantee all necessary care. This was an encouragement to&#13;
minimize unnecessary use of services and excessively high-cost care. Hospitals were reimbursed for&#13;
treating patients according to the type and complexity of illness, classified into Clinical Statistical Groups&#13;
(CSG), much like the DRG system in the United States. Although the system contained serious flaws,&#13;
including the absence of quality assurance mechanisms to counteract the incentive to reduce service levels&#13;
and the lack of a cap to contain total hospital costs, the experiment succeeded in reducing hospital&#13;
admissions and length of stay, as well as bed capacity.&#13;
1.32    The series of laws and decrees passed from 1991 through 1993 brought sweeping changes to the&#13;
health sector. They confirmed the new Government's intent to guarantee universal access to health&#13;
services, created the framework for both mandatory and voluntary health insurance, introduced a 3.6&#13;
&#13;

percent payroll tax paid by employers to fund mandatory health insurance, decentralized management and&#13;

1.33    There were great hopes on the part of its proponents that "insurance medicine," as it was called,&#13;
would produce major improvements in Russian health care. In actual fact, the results of the recent&#13;
changes have been disappointing, for a number of reasons. First, the system was adopted without&#13;
sufficient preparation. Although the earlier experiments on provider payments taught valuable lessons,&#13;
there had been no experience in the management of compulsory health insurance funds. Implementing&#13;
regulations were insufficient and appropriate regulatory bodies did not exist. Private health insurance&#13;
companies which were expected to be the principal insurers were initially few in numbers. Although&#13;
hundreds of new companies emerged in just a few years, they were largely inexperienced. At the oblast&#13;
level, the respective responsibilities and authorities of Oblast Health Authorities and THIFs were not&#13;
clearly delineated. Neither the Federal Ministry of Health nor the FHIF were in a position to offer&#13;
guidance to local authorities or to the newly constituted THIFs in implementing the law.&#13;
1.34    It is increasingly recognized that the process of reform will require years, even decades, to&#13;
complete. In addition to filling the regulatory and institutional gaps in the health financing system, closer&#13;
attention needs to be given to the service delivery system, to enable it to respond effectively to the new&#13;
financing environment. System-wide as well as at the level of the facility and the individual practitioner,&#13;
efficient and cost-effective organizational and managerial systems and clinical practices need to be&#13;
introduced. The introduction of the practice of Family Medicine in 1992 was an important first step in&#13;
restructuring the delivery system in favor of primary care, but much more is required. In the process&#13;
of restructuring, massive investments will be needed to upgrade the quality of physical and human capital&#13;
in the system to make up for years of under-investment, particularly at those levels of the system that&#13;
promise to be the most cost-effective.&#13;
1.35    The current fluid state of governance in the health sector is one of the most difficult factors to&#13;
contend with in undertaking health reform. The decentralization of health care, the introduction of&#13;
compulsory health insurance and the entry of private insurers and providers have changed governance&#13;
relationships fundamentally. The MOH has lost virtually all responsibility for management and financing&#13;
of care. The oblasts, which have inherited this authority are eager to take charge of their health systems&#13;
and make important policy decisions. However, given the limited access to information on alternative&#13;
health systems and a lack of the necessary expertise at this level, oblast authorities are largely unprepared&#13;
to do this. At the same time, there is clearly a need to maintain a basic regulatory framework for the&#13;
entire Federation including both medical and financial aspects of health care, as well as to build&#13;
leadership and guidance to facilitate reform in all 89 oblasts ("subjects of the Federation") and avoid&#13;
wasteful duplication. This latter role, for which the MOH and other federal-level institutions are well-&#13;
placed, requires a fundamental change in orientation and a new skills mix not yet found in these&#13;
institutions.&#13;
1.36    As Russia proceeds with the difficult challenge of formulating and implementing strategies for&#13;
health reform, the following areas of reform are expected to dominate:&#13;
* The Regulatory Environment for Health Insurance. The legislative and regulatory framework&#13;
needs to be modified and/or further developed.  Still to be clarified are: the level of&#13;
contributions to be made on behalf of the non-working population; the financial entitlement&#13;
per capita, adjusted for risk, to be transferred to insurance companies on behalf of each&#13;
insured; the minimum package of services guaranteed under the compulsory system. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 10                                                                              Introduction&#13;
oversight and regulatory framework for HIFs and private insurance companies must be&#13;
defined and the relevant regulatory agencies established.&#13;
*  Provider Payments. Problems with early experiments in new provider payment mechanisms&#13;
are not surprising given the intricacies involved in crafting payment systems that try to meet&#13;
often conflicting objectives: improving quality, capping costs, reducing reliance on high-tech&#13;
medicine, motivating physicians, protecting consumers. Further experiments should be&#13;
encouraged, with appropriate technical guidance. Ongoing experiments should be assessed&#13;
and their findings widely disseminated.&#13;
*  Clinical Practices and Other Norms. Clinical practices must be brought up-to-date and made&#13;
more cost-conscious across all fields of medicine. In particular, guidelines for managing&#13;
different disease categories must give greater emphasis to preventive interventions, the role&#13;
of the primary care provider, and outpatient diagnosis and treatment. High-tech, high-cost&#13;
interventions must be evaluated with respect to both cost-effectiveness and affordability.&#13;
Corresponding norms for staffing, technology and infrastructure requirements at all levels of&#13;
the system must be adjusted as new clinical norms are developed.&#13;
*  Restructuring the Health Care Industry.  Cost-effective health care delivery will require&#13;
significant reorientation in the structure of the health services network, away from specialized&#13;
inpatient facilities and in favor of outpatient facilities. The network of family physicians will&#13;
form the foundation of outpatient services, supported by appropriate (affordable) diagnostic&#13;
and referral services. Massive investments in retraining of health personnel as well as&#13;
investments in physical capital to strengthen outpatient capacity are necessary. Downsizing&#13;
of the hospital sector should proceed in parallel.&#13;
*  Autonomy of Health Providers. As a real market for health services emerges, with providers&#13;
no longer unconditionally guaranteed their budgets and incomes, managers of health facilities&#13;
and individual providers can be expected to absorb a larger share of autonomy as well as&#13;
accountability. Health service institutions from hospitals down to the solo practitioner will&#13;
need to function more like free-standing economic units, subject of course to appropriate&#13;
regulations and financing arrangements. Stable financing sources and well-defined provider&#13;
payment systems, complemented with modern quality assurance mechanisms, are&#13;
prerequisites for provider autonomy. Professional associations also have a role to play, in&#13;
re-education of practitioners and eventually in setting up self-policed quality assurance&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
*  Development of Public Institutions. Public institutions, including the Ministry of Health, the&#13;
Sanitary Service, research and academic institutions, and oblast and local authorities will need&#13;
to redefine their roles vis-a-vis provision, regulation and support of other health institutions.&#13;
Among the key tasks of public institutions will be to provide political leadership in the drive&#13;
to promote healthier lifestyles. Appropriate regulatory bodies to oversee operations of&#13;
insurance companies and providers, as well as effective fora for negotiation between insurers&#13;
and providers need to be established. Consumer interest groups should also be encouraged.&#13;
Consumers must learn to exercise their rights and obligations and take greater responsibility&#13;
for their own health.&#13;

The Project Context                                                                Page 11&#13;
II. THE PROJECT CONTEXT&#13;
A. Project Evolution&#13;
2. 1      This project evolved from contacts with the Federal Ministry of Health (MOH) and the&#13;
Federal Ministry of Finance (MOF) in 1992 when Bank assistance was provided under the Technical&#13;
Cooperation Program to develop and implement health reform in Russia. TA granted under that program&#13;
assisted with the amendment of the Health Insurance Law in 1993. These contacts led to discussions of&#13;
further Bank assistance to finance badly-needed investments in the sector. Project preparation initially&#13;
focused on nine priority program areas that had been identified by the MOH: pharmaceutical manufacture&#13;
and distribution; implementation of the health insurance law; maternal and child health, including family&#13;
planning; immunization; medical education; public health and health care management training;&#13;
emergency care; catastrophic care; and facilities upgrading. Working Groups consisting of Russian and&#13;
foreign specialists were formed on each of these topics, on the understanding that only some of the&#13;
programs could eventually benefit from a first health project.&#13;
2.2       As preparation progressed, it became apparent that many of the programs on the list - and&#13;
in fact much of the effort for health reform in Russia - could only be successfully implemented with full&#13;
involvement of oblast-level authorities who had been granted substantial autonomy for health&#13;
administration and financing under the newly-adopted laws. It also became evident, given the vast needs&#13;
in the sector, that any health reform program was going to be a complex undertaking that could only be&#13;
implemented in a step-wise fashion. In early 1994, a decision was made to focus the project on a small&#13;
number of project oblasts that would serve as pilot areas for testing new approaches to reform.&#13;
2.3       A short list of six oblasts was drawn up jointly by the MOF, the MOH and the World Bank&#13;
team on the basis of the following criteria: the oblasts were to have "average" income levels and health&#13;
patterns, ready accessibility, demonstrated interest in establishing new provider payment mechanisms,&#13;
oblast administrations committed to health reform, and willingness to share the debt service burden with&#13;
the Federal Government and provide counterpart funds related to project costs. These oblasts were&#13;
invited to present their respective programs at a workshop held in October 1994. Three oblasts were&#13;
initially selected for participation in the project on the strength of their presentations. The number was&#13;
eventually reduced to two (Kaluga and Tver Oblasts) when it became apparent that a project which in&#13;
effect consisted of three separate sub-projects, would be too difficult to prepare and supervise.&#13;
2.4       The process of oblast selection has been proven especially valuable for building ownership.&#13;
The two oblast sub-projects, though considerably evolved from the original proposals, are essentially the&#13;
oblasts' own projects. In addition, preparation itself has been highly participatory, with separate working&#13;
groups fully involved for each component and, in the case of Kaluga, with participation from managers&#13;
of facilities directly affected by the proposed health system restructuring.&#13;
2.5       Of the nine original Working Groups at the federal level, two have had direct influence on&#13;
the project. The Working Group on Maternal and Child Health has prepared a completely updated set&#13;
of protocols for MCH and has tested these out successfully in a clinic in Lubertsy Oblast near Moscow.&#13;
These new protocols form the backbone for MCH components in Kaluga and Tver. The Working Group&#13;
on Family Medicine has prepared and will now implement a national program in Family Medicine, now&#13;
a component of the project.&#13;
&#13;

Page 12                                                                      The Project Context&#13;
B. The World Bank's Assistance Strategy for Russia&#13;
2.6        The Health Reform Pilot Project (HRPP) is part of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
presented to the Board on September 25, 1996. A major objective of the CAS is to support human&#13;
resource development and poverty alleviation. It aims to do this by, among other things, facilitating&#13;
health reform to improve the quality and efficiency of health care provision. The CAS also aims to&#13;
develop public sector institutions and procedures supportive of open and competitive markets. The health&#13;
service sector, with its dual objectives of efficiency and equity and its inherent market imperfections, is&#13;
not a typical economic sector. Its development requires a balance between public sector involvement and&#13;
market-type operations that is difficult to achieve. This challenge, combined with the large investments&#13;
needed to maintain and upgrade these critical social services, make the health sector a high-priority area&#13;
for World Bank assistance.&#13;
2.7        The HRPP is one of four operations in the proposed lending program that address the health&#13;
sector.  The Medical Equipment Project and the Community Social Infrastructure Project address&#13;
investment needs in medical equipment and physical infrastructure respectively3'. Both projects target&#13;
investments to primary care and basic referral facilities where health services are more cost-effective than&#13;
in the currently-preferred specialized hospital-based care.&#13;
2.8        The HRPP represents an integrated approach to reform focussed at the oblast level, combining&#13;
investments in equipment and physical facilities with fundamental reorganization of health services,&#13;
changes in clinical practice, and new provider payment and quality assurance mechanisms. These priority&#13;
areas for systemic change in health were identified in the Social Sector Strategy Note used as a&#13;
background document to the above-mentioned CAS. A small technical assistance loan to support the&#13;
reform of governance structures, increase long-term capacity for policy development and address high-&#13;
priority policy reform in such areas as health insurance legislation and regulation or general norms and&#13;
standards in health care delivery is planned for FY98. Assuming implementation proceeds satisfactorily&#13;
and the policy environment evolves positively, the intention is to support more HRPP-type projects on&#13;
a larger scale, expanding beyond the two pilot oblasts covered in the project.&#13;
C. Lessons From Experience&#13;
2.9        While not the first project involving the health sector in Russia, this is the first operation to&#13;
attempt broad, system-wide reform. With respect to project concept and design, it draws valuable lessons&#13;
from health reform efforts that have taken place in middle-income and industrialized countries over the&#13;
past two decades. Although the Russians look particularly to OECD country experience to guide their&#13;
reforms, perhaps the most relevant lessons come from the countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).&#13;
Since the onset of glasnost and perestroika in countries in the Soviet sphere, and particularly after the&#13;
start of the full transition in these countries, health reform has been attempted in every one of them.&#13;
Their experience is relevant both because they present the unique precedent of countries attempting health&#13;
reform in the vortex of fundamental social and political transformation, and because many of these&#13;
countries' health systems were closely patterned after the "Soviet model".&#13;
2.10       Many lessons emerging from the early years of reform in the CEE have had strong impact&#13;
on the approach to reform  applied in the present project.  First is recognition of the primordial&#13;
importance of changing incentives within the system. Until providers of health care are paid on the basis&#13;
3 The latter project also treats the education, and water and sanitation sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project Context                                                                   Page 13&#13;
of services rendered or risks shared rather than on input levels, efficiency problems cannot be resolved.&#13;
Financial and other incentives are also needed to instill professional responsibility and to replace old-style&#13;
enforcement mechanisms. Second is the need to maintain some form of public sector involvement in&#13;
health, even as the rest of the economy moves towards market competition. For reasons of equity as well&#13;
as efficiency, public intervention is most needed in the form of public financing and regulation, with&#13;
elements of competition introduced wherever possible. Third, despite these countries' well-deserved&#13;
reputation for ensuring universal access to care and providing the most medically advanced care at the&#13;
highest levels, the quality of care leaves much to be desired. The extent of deterioration in both physical&#13;
and human capital that permeates these systems calls for massive investments in retraining of personnel,&#13;
purchase of new equipment, renovation of buildings, information systems, etc., and a parallel&#13;
streamlining of an overextended network of health care providers. The focus needs to change from&#13;
quantity to quality and to the most cost-effective, affordable package of services. Fourth is the need to&#13;
have the orientation of care evolve as the burden of disease has evolved. This is particularly true for&#13;
preventive measures which, notably successful in fighting infectious disease, have lagged seriously behind&#13;
in fighting non-communicable disease. Fifth, and perhaps the most positive lesson, is the great potential&#13;
for quick improvement that could result from much-needed exposure to information and training of a&#13;
professional cadre that is exceptionally well-educated and dedicated to their professions.&#13;
2.11      The project builds on the experiments on incentive-based provider payment systems&#13;
introduced under the New Economic Mechanisms in the late 1980s (para. 1.31). This experience showed&#13;
that while case-based provider payments can increase efficiency in hospitals, there is need to balance these&#13;
incentives with a mechanism to cap overall hospital expenditures such as direct budget caps for hospitals&#13;
and/or incentives at outpatient facilities to reduce referrals to hospitals. The importance of incentives,&#13;
financial or otherwise, to assure service quality was also highlighted. Ongoing experiments in provider&#13;
payments, management information systems and quality assurance in Siberia under the USAID-funded&#13;
Zdrav Reform Program, in family physician education in St. Petersburg and Moscow, in emergency&#13;
services organization in Vladivostok and Moscow, and in maternal and child car service protocols in&#13;
Lubertsy (para. 2.5) are all contributing to project design and creating local expertise that can be tapped&#13;
for the present project.&#13;
2.12      With respect to implementation, Russia is experiencing problems typical of first-time&#13;
borrowers, exacerbated by its lack of familiarity with the workings of competitive local and international&#13;
economies and complexities arising from its federal structure. The 1996 Country Portfolio Performance&#13;
Review (CPPR) highlighted the need to set up project management arrangements early during preparation&#13;
and to clarify terms of on-lending sufficiently early to avoid delays in project effectiveness. Submission&#13;
of a proposal for the legal status of the CSU as well as agreement between federal and oblast governments&#13;
on terms of on-lending are conditions of negotiations. The 1995 CPPR also stressed the importance of&#13;
ensuring ownership of the project by those agencies/individuals who would be directly responsible for&#13;
implementation. The preparation process of this project has worked strongly in favor of building&#13;
ownership especially at the oblast level (para. 2.4). Finally, the quality of accounting of project funds&#13;
is emerging increasingly as a concern. An expert in project accounting familiar with current Russian&#13;
practices and the areas needing attention, will be advising the CSU on establishment of project accounts.&#13;

III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
3.1       The project's objective is to achieve improvements in the quality and efficiency of health care&#13;
and in reproductive and cardiovascular health outcomes in two pilot oblasts sufficient to make decisions&#13;
about national adoption of specific reform measures.&#13;
3.2       The project focuses on three high-priority reform measures:&#13;
*  changing incentive systems through the introduction of output-driven, cost-&#13;
conscious provider payment mechanisms, accompanied by information-based&#13;
quality assurance schemes;&#13;
*  reorienting health care by strengthening primary care services, centered on a&#13;
network of Family Physicians, and correspondingly reducing inpatient care&#13;
services; and&#13;
*  improving practices in two important areas of care -- maternal and child health&#13;
and cardiovascular health -- with an emphasis on promoting healthy lifestyles and&#13;
offering better-quality, cost-effective, and affordable prevention, diagnosis and&#13;
treatment.&#13;
In keeping with the decentralized structure of health administration, the project is organized around the&#13;
oblast as the principal operational unit for implementing reform.&#13;
3.3       Most project activities are experimental in nature, hence the project approach of testing them&#13;
in two pilot oblasts, Kaluga and Tver. Monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of project outcomes&#13;
constitute an important component of the project's development objectives.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.4       The project consists of four parts: two independent sub-projects, each consisting of a package&#13;
of reform measures to be undertaken in a participating oblast; one component to strengthen national and&#13;
regional training programs in Family Medicine; and one component to monitor, evaluate, disseminate and&#13;
replicate project results. Although the underlying principles of reform are the same, each oblast sub-&#13;
project is unique, having been shaped by local oblast priorities, institutional capacities, and other local&#13;
conditions.&#13;
Part I: Kaluga Oblast Health Reform (Base Cost US$44.2 million)&#13;
Delivery System Restructuring (Base Cost US$25.3 million)&#13;
3.5       This component aims to increase the range, volume, quality and accessibility of services&#13;
offered at outpatient facilities and correspondingly reduce the share of inpatient services. Specifically,&#13;
it would expand the role of primary care providers and shift most diagnostic procedures and about 30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Objectives and Description                                                           Page 15&#13;
percent of treatment procedures currently done in hospitals to outpatient facilities. To do this it would&#13;
undertake a major restructuring of the delivery system.&#13;
3.6        Structure of the New System. The introduction of family physicians as the principal provider&#13;
of primary care constitutes a central pillar of the restructuring. The family physician replaces the present&#13;
cadre of "therapists" and shifts the emphasis away from medical specialization. At present the therapist&#13;
is trained at a rudimentary level in the discipline of internal medicine but in practice does little more than&#13;
screen patients for referral to specialists. Specialists tend to emphasize hospitalization and are trained to&#13;
be technology dependent. In contrast, the family physician is trained to emphasize health promotion and&#13;
prevention services and is able to treat the bulk of common ailments and injuries without the need for&#13;
high technology. The family physician (together with medical assistants and nurses trained in family&#13;
centered health care) will constitute the point of entry into the health system and function as "gatekeepers"&#13;
for the system. Except in emergency cases, all admissions to higher levels of the system will require&#13;
referral from primary care providers. The current practice of self-referral by patients directly to higher&#13;
levels of the system will no longer be permitted. Family physicians will also increasingly receive patients&#13;
who are referred back from higher levels of the system for follow-up care.&#13;
3.7        Family physicians in solo and small group practices (with three or fewer doctors) will be&#13;
located in ambulatories where therapists are currently found as well as in existing smaller polyclinics or&#13;
district hospitals. In higher density areas (e.g., in Kaluga city) family physicians will be organized into&#13;
group practices consisting of four or more physicians. These group practices will offer the same services&#13;
as family physicians, similarly acting as primary caregivers and gatekeepers. In the initial stages, group&#13;
practices could consist of groups of sub-specialists (e.g., pediatricians, obstetrician-gynecologists,&#13;
internists) offering primary care but without specialist training in family-oriented care. Over time, these&#13;
same specialists could be trained to function as full-fledged family physicians, although with a particular&#13;
strong field of practice related to their earlier specialization. Primary care group practices will be&#13;
established at large polyclinics attached to rayon or municipal hospitals, in existing smaller polyclinics,&#13;
or in a limited number of new facilities in Kaluga Municipality.&#13;
3.8        The family physician will have access to Consultation, Diagnostic and Treatment Centers&#13;
(CDTC) to which referrals can be made on an outpatient basis. The CDTC would replace the polyclinic&#13;
as the multi-disciplinary outpatient referral facility, providing services in about 15 medical disciplines.&#13;
CDTCs will be endowed with diagnostic and treatment capacity greater than that currently found in&#13;
polyclinics. This would allow them to carry out many more tests on an outpatient basis prior to or in&#13;
lieu  of hospitalization.   They  would  also  gradually  develop  capacity  to  offer day  surgery.&#13;
Polyclinics/CDTCs attached to rayon or municipal hospitals, at present administratively part of the&#13;
hospital, will become independent functional units. They will, however, also provide diagnostic services&#13;
to hospitals, reducing the need for maintaining duplicative diagnostic capacity in hospitals. In turn, day&#13;
surgery centers in CDTCs will have access to surgical and related facilities in hospitals.&#13;
3.9        Inpatient capacity will be significantly reduced. District hospitals, most of which are too&#13;
small to function efficiently, will be gradually closed or reorganized into nursing homes under the&#13;
responsibility of other social services. In a few cases parts of the district hospitals will be transformed&#13;
into general or group practices. In the larger hospitals, changes in the scope and capacity of outpatient&#13;
services should lead to reductions in inpatient admissions as well as in length of stay. Organizational&#13;
improvements within hospitals and upgrading of the physical capital would also reduce length of stay.&#13;
3.10       Oblast, municipal and rayon management teams will be constituted to provide guidance to&#13;
health practitioners and facility managers during the period of transition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 16                                                       Project Objectives and Description&#13;
3.11      The restructured delivery system will thus consist of seven organizational and operational&#13;
building blocks which will constitute a model for the entire oblast: (i) feldsher stations in low-density&#13;
areas; (ii) family physician offices; (iii) group practices of primary care givers in high-density areas; (iv)&#13;
CDTCs; (v) general and "emergency" hospitals; (vi) specialist referral hospitals; and (vii) oblast,&#13;
municipal and rayon management teams. Annex 2 summarizes the differences in structure and in patient&#13;
flows between the existing system and the proposed new system.&#13;
3.12      Proiect Areas. Such far-reaching restructuring will take years to accomplish, and will need&#13;
to continue beyond the life of the project. The project will support the start of the restructuring in a&#13;
limited area - in Kaluga Municipality and in the rayons of Maloyaroslavsky, Ferzikovsky, Baryatinsky,&#13;
Zhizdrinsky and Medynsky - covering a population of about 450,000 people, over 40 percent of the&#13;
oblast's total population. The component will be implemented in a phased manner, starting with Kaluga&#13;
Municipality in the first year of the project. Maloyaroslavsky and Ferzikovsky rayons will follow in year&#13;
two, with the remaining three rayons starting reforms in year three. This restructuring covers only levels&#13;
of the system at and below the rayon/municipal level. It does not affect oblast-level specialty hospitals.&#13;
3.13      The restructuring plan for the project areas, prepared on the basis of a needs assessment,&#13;
involves establishment of a total of 30 family physician offices in solo or small group practices (with a&#13;
total of 35 physicians), 23 primary care group practices (162 physicians), and nine CDTCs. The number&#13;
of feldsher stations will be reduced from 125 to 97, with four stations to be upgraded to family physician&#13;
offices and the remaining 24 to be closed. All ambulatories will be converted to family physician offices.&#13;
Two district hospitals will be closed (partly converted to family physician offices) with the remaining two&#13;
to be converted to nursing care facilities by the end of the project. A day surgery center will be&#13;
established in the CDTC attached to the Emergency Hospital in Kaluga; this will serve as a pilot for the&#13;
eventual introduction of day surgery centers in other CDTCs in the oblast.&#13;
3.14      Under the project, the Kaluga Emergency Hospital will be used as a pilot for establishing&#13;
more efficient and cost-effective operations in inpatient care facilities, with the objective of reducing&#13;
admissions and length of stay, and improving the quality of care. It is expected that 30 percent of&#13;
inpatient surgery will be transferred to day surgery resulting in closure of 50 beds. An additional 80 beds&#13;
(one floor of the hospital) will be closed by the end of the third project year as a result of reduced length&#13;
of stay.&#13;
3.15      The total number of planned bed closings under this component is 352 out of a total of 1600,&#13;
or a little over 20 percent, in the facilities involved in the restructuring. Annex 2 presents a detailed&#13;
schedule of all restructuring activities planned under the project.  Timely implementation of this&#13;
restructuring plan will constitute a key component of the project's benchmarks.&#13;
3.16      Proiect Costs. To support the above restructuring, the project would finance the costs of:&#13;
(i) minor civil works, equipment, and medical vehicles for 30 family physician offices, 23 primary care&#13;
group practice offices, 9 CDTCs, and 1 day surgery center; minor civil works and equipment for 2&#13;
district hospitals (during the transition to nursing care beds) and 1 rayon hospital; and equipment for the&#13;
Kaluga Emergency Hospital; (ii) study tours and TA to prepare training programs for family physicians,&#13;
group practices and other facility managers on the new structure and on office/facilities management; and&#13;
(iii) the incremental recurrent costs of the new system (including drugs and operation and maintenance&#13;
of buildings and equipment) in the project areas. Basic training/retraining for family physicians is taking&#13;
place under ongoing programs, both in Kaluga and at the Moscow Medical Academy. The oblast training&#13;
program will be improved with support from the Academy to allow training to take place on a larger&#13;
scale and at a lower cost to the oblast.&#13;
&#13;

3.17      Incremental Recurrent Costs. The expansion of outpatient care capacity is expected to result&#13;
in an increase in operating costs of the system. This will be only partially offset by reductions in the&#13;
operating cost of hospitals, given that some of the savings generated within hospitals would be needed&#13;
to fill the current funding gap in these facilities. Estimates indicate that, by the end of the project period&#13;
when all project investments under this component will be in place, a net increase of 43 percent in real&#13;
recurrent budgets compared to 1995 levels will be required in the project areas (consisting of a 56&#13;
percent increase in Kaluga Municipality and 13 percent increase in the five project rayons) to bring the&#13;
restructured system to full operation. Assuming that rayon and municipal health budgets grow at the&#13;
same rate as real output in the oblast - currently projected to grow by 37 percent between the years 1995&#13;
and 20034' - it is not unrealistic to expect that these additional recurrent costs can be absorbed by the&#13;
rayons and municipality if accompanied by further reductions in inpatient care and continued&#13;
improvements in overall efficiency in the long run.&#13;
3.18      To help bridge the financing gap, the IBRD loan will finance incremental recurrent costs&#13;
during the life of the project. In addition, to ensure that appropriate shares are allocated to outpatient&#13;
facilities in the oblast in support of delivery system restructuring, the oblast agreed (as a legal covenant&#13;
of the project) to increase recurrent expenditures for outpatient services as a share of total oblast&#13;
recurrent expenditures for health (including THIF and oblast budget expenditures) to at least the&#13;
following levels: in 1999, to 35 percent; in 2000, to 40 percent; in 2001, to 45 percent, and in 2002,&#13;
to 50 percent. In addition, the oblast agreed to ensure that (i) during each year the health budget&#13;
as a share of the total budget (including oblast budget, rayon budgets and municipal budgets) shall&#13;
be no less than during the previous year; (ii) the actual health expenditures as a share of total&#13;
expenditures shall be no less than the health budget as a share of the total budget for the respective&#13;
year; and (iii) furnish to the Project CSU adequate information to monitor compliance with points&#13;
(i) and (ii).&#13;
Restructuring Provider Incentives (Base Cost US$6.0 million)&#13;
3.19      Provider Payment. Kaluga is proposing to fundamentally change the current systems of&#13;
payment to hospitals and polyclinics and replace them with systems that encourage provision at the least&#13;
costly, medically appropriate level. The reforms proposed are designed to promote primary care,&#13;
eliminate unnecessary referrals to specialists, reduce hospital admissions, and reduce lengths of stay in&#13;
hospitals. These payment system changes will reinforce the above Delivery System Restructuring&#13;
Component and, conversely.&#13;
3.20      The proposed reforms are based on the concept of the primary care physician being a&#13;
fundholder, paid on a capitation basis for each patient enrolled, but at financial risk for referrals and&#13;
admissions. The basic features of this system are:&#13;
* Family physicians based either in group- or in free-standing practices will&#13;
become fundholders and be paid on a capitation basis for each patient enrolled.&#13;
Since primary care physicians will be at risk for referrals to specialists and&#13;
hospitals, they will have incentives to treat the patient rather than to refer.&#13;
Various models for this primary care fundholding approach are being considered&#13;
and will be developed for implementation. Given the proposed strong incentives&#13;
4/ In the absence of oblast-specific growth projections, the Bank's projections for changes in real&#13;
output in Russia as a whole are used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 18                                                     Project Objectives and Description&#13;
not to refer to the next highest levels of care, systems to monitor quality and&#13;
access will be needed to assure that patients receive medically necessary specialist&#13;
and hospital services.&#13;
*  Outpatient specialists who will be practicing in CDTCs under the reformed&#13;
system will likely be paid on the basis of completed cases (e.g. a diagnosis-based&#13;
case payment) or fees.&#13;
*  The Clinical Statistical Group (CSG) system for hospitals will be reassessed.&#13;
Other possible hospital payment systems to reinforce incentives for&#13;
deinstitutionalization and cap overall hospital expenditures (including global&#13;
budgeting adjusted for case-mix, severity and volume of services), will be&#13;
considered.&#13;
3.21      While the basic conceptual design has been elaborated, the precise details of the new payment&#13;
systems are being developed with assistance from the United States Agency for International Development&#13;
(USAID). The design and preparation phases of the pilot are ongoing in each of the six pilot sites, and&#13;
are expected to be completed in the most advanced sites by end-September 1996.&#13;
3.22      The project will provide the necessary training, computers, equipment, and software to&#13;
implement these systems initially in Kaluga Municipality and the five rayons included under the System&#13;
Restructuring component and in tandem with that component (para 3.12), and then oblast-wide in the last&#13;
year of the project.  An interactive computer network of facilities, the THIF, and the Health&#13;
Administration will be established, with the computer center located at the Oblast Information Processing&#13;
Center and jointly managed by the THIF and the Oblast Health Authority. One computer per facility and&#13;
several for the THIF will be purchased to support the new payment system.&#13;
3.23      All primary care physicians will receive training in management and finance to help them&#13;
understand and use the new payment system.  Each facility manager will be trained in modern&#13;
management principles in order to manage his/her facility under the new payment arrangements. Two&#13;
staff persons per facility will be trained to implement and operate the new payment mechanisms at the&#13;
facility level.&#13;
3.24      Under the project, an "incentive payment pool" of US$1.4 million will be established for&#13;
primary care physicians. This fund will be used for incentive payments to primary care physicians and&#13;
nurses to reward cost-reducing behavior and expanded levels of service. Payments could enable&#13;
physicians and nurses to earn up to 2.5 times their current salaries, basically putting their compensation&#13;
on par with comparable physicians and nurses in hospitals. The incentive payments will be earned as a&#13;
result of performance and will not be used simply to increase salaries.  For each participating&#13;
rayon/municipality, project support for incentives will cover only the first year of implementation of the&#13;
new payment system. Precise mechanisms and conditions for management and disbursement of funds&#13;
under the incentive pool will depend on the nature of the new payment system to be detailed with USAID&#13;
assistance. Because the introduction of new provider incentives is at the core of the oblast's efforts&#13;
to improve the efficiency and quality of health services, completion of detailed plans acceptable to&#13;
the Bank for the pilot phase of the Provider Incentives Component, including plans for&#13;
implementation and regulation of the incentive payment pool, is a condition of disbursement on all&#13;
components of the Kaluga Oblast Sub-project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.25      Quality Assurance. To ensure that service quality improves even as costs are controlled,&#13;
Kaluga plans to undertake a major reform in its quality assurance systems. Quality will be enhanced by&#13;
incorporating quality-based performance standards in the new payment systems, by establishing quality&#13;
coordination functions at the oblast level and in each hospital, through the introduction of structure- and&#13;
process-related quality standards (including modern medical treatment standards) for hospitals, polyclinics,&#13;
and physicians, and through information dissemination. Kaluga also intends to establish new accreditation&#13;
standards for facilities and training of personnel. The intent is to replace the current system with modern&#13;
standards of care that rely more on education, continuous quality improvement techniques, and tracking&#13;
of consumer satisfaction than on punitive measures. USAID TA is also being provided to design and&#13;
pilot new quality assurance mechanisms prior to implementation under the project.&#13;
3.26      To coordinate the wide range of activities involved in upgrading quality assurance, the oblast&#13;
will appoint a Quality Coordinator whose office will receive support under the project. In hospitals, three&#13;
new positions will be created: hospital quality coordinator, an infection control coordinator, and a&#13;
pharmacologist. Project funds will be used to help establish these new coordinating structures in the&#13;
oblast and individual institutions with support for: training, TA, study tours and dissemination of&#13;
informational materials; salaries for oblast and hospital QA officers; establishment of a Drug Quality&#13;
Control lab, and incremental operating costs of the Drug Control Lab.&#13;
Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning (Base Cost US$11.2 million)&#13;
3.27      With a view to improving the quality of care and promoting efficiency, a review of current&#13;
organizational structures and protocols for maternal and child health care was undertaken at the federal&#13;
level by a Working Group on Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning. This analysis highlighted&#13;
the importance of changing practices in antenatal care, of upgrading care in the perinatal period, and of&#13;
introducing a wider menu of family planning and reproductive health services, including alternatives to&#13;
abortion as a family planning method and diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections&#13;
(STIs). It also indicated that existing organizational structures hamper the provision of optimal care. For&#13;
instance, separating delivery in the maternity home from the provision of acute neonatal care in children's&#13;
hospitals inhibits the prompt treatment of sick babies. Similarly, the separation of diagnosis of STIs in&#13;
women's consultations from their treatment in highly stigmatized venereology clinics lessens the&#13;
likelihood that women and their partners will in fact be treated.&#13;
3.28      This component will implement selected reforms in (i) antenatal care; (ii) perinatal care; (iii)&#13;
family planning and reproductive health; and (iv) health promotion and professional education. The aim&#13;
is to increase efficiency and effectiveness of organization and service delivery, and emphasize health&#13;
promotion, a cost effective strategy that has been identified as crucial in improving maternal and child&#13;
health.&#13;
3.29      The component will be implemented oblast-wide, except for investments in perinatal care&#13;
which will be concentrated in municipal and oblast maternity homes in Kaluga city and in eight selected&#13;
rayons (Kirovsky, Ljudinovsky, Kozelsky, Dzerginsky, Zchukovsky, Borovsky, Suhinitchesky, and&#13;
Maloyaroslavsky). Out of the 23 rayon maternity departments, these eight were chosen because of the&#13;
quality of their physical infrastructure, geographic distribution, and the volume of deliveries. It is&#13;
planned to close lesser maternity departments over time.&#13;
3.30      Antenatal Care. In Russia, more appropriate and effective antenatal care would require&#13;
improving counseling for future parents, revising the content of antenatal visits to reflect modern&#13;
practices, and improving maternal health (including reducing rates of anaemia among pregnant women).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 20                                                       Project Objectives and Description&#13;
To achieve these goals, the oblast authorities will conduct a review of protocols in antenatal care and&#13;
provide training in updated methods of antenatal counseling and care for all obstetrician-gynecologists&#13;
and midwives in the oblast (about 100 providers). Additional training in specific aspects of antenatal care&#13;
will also be provided for selected personnel. Twelve women's consultations will be provided with&#13;
improved diagnostic capacity , and three will add psychologists/social workers to their staff. Routine&#13;
vitamin and iron folate supplementation will be introduced. Health promotion will be incorporated into&#13;
routine antenatal care, with the support of the Health Promotion Unit to be set up under the sub-&#13;
component described below (para. 3.36).&#13;
3.31      Perinatal Care. Optimal care of women and infants during labor, delivery and the post-&#13;
partum  period requires both appropriate medical care and a supportive environment.  Creating a&#13;
supportive environment in the maternity home is at the heart of the principles of mother-baby-friendly&#13;
hospitals (modeled after the WHO/UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative). These hospitals are built&#13;
on a concept of perinatal care that promotes rooming-in of mother and baby, encourages early&#13;
breastfeeding, provides individualized delivery rooms where possible, facilitates the presence of a&#13;
supportive father, and encourages the use of analgesics when necessary.&#13;
3.32      This approach to care improves both psychological and physical well-being of mother and&#13;
child and leads to a nurturing relationship that lays the basis for long-term family-centered health. It must&#13;
also be supported by adequate medical care including the capacity to respond to emergencies and adequate&#13;
referral and transport systems for high-risk patients. In Russia, immediate resuscitation of sick newborns&#13;
in the delivery room has been identified as a priority, as has management of obstetric emergencies.&#13;
3.33      This sub-component will provide minor civil works and furniture to support rooming-in in&#13;
the 10 target maternity homes mentioned above. TA will be provided to help introduce the principles&#13;
of the Baby Friendly Initiative. A foreign midwife will be recruited to be in residence in Kaluga for three&#13;
months to provide day-to-day guidance on improving care in maternity homes, as well as small training&#13;
courses on specific topics. Training in management of labor, anesthesiology, reanimation and other&#13;
clinical interventions will be provided for staff in these facilities. In addition, a system of training of&#13;
trainers for basic neonatal resuscitation will be developed and implemented oblast-wide. The project will&#13;
finance basic equipment, and necessary drugs and supplies to upgrade services in the 10 maternity homes.&#13;
In addition, the position of psychologist/social worker will be introduced. To improve the referral and&#13;
transport systems for emergencies, one ambulance will be provided and all target maternity homes will&#13;
be provided with communications equipment.&#13;
3.34      Improving Family Planning and Reproductive Health Services. In Kaluga, only 19.3 percent&#13;
of women of reproductive age use modern forms of contraception, according to official statistics.&#13;
Increasing numbers of sexually active teenagers is a special concern. A major effort is needed to&#13;
encourage women to shift to safer and surer methods of contraception and reduce reliance on abortion.&#13;
This will require a two-pronged approach of: (i) increasing public awareness of the dangers of repeat&#13;
abortions and the benefits of contraception; and (ii) increasing health providers' skills in family planning&#13;
counseling and management of contraceptive users. In addition, with increasing incidence of STIs,&#13;
women's consultations should have the capacity to diagnose and treat patients in-house, without referral&#13;
to venerology clinics.&#13;
3.35      To address these problems, more than 1200 medical personnel (obstetrician-gynecologists,&#13;
nurses, midwives, feldshers, school nurses, and family physicians) will be trained in FP methods and&#13;
counseling through the Oblast Family Planning Center (FPC). The Center will receive equipment and&#13;
supplies for its training and counseling activities. Free contraceptives will be provided to target groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Objectives and Description                                                   Page 21&#13;
(teens, low-income women) through the FPC and women's consultations. Two laparoscopes for&#13;
sterilization and the requisite supplies and training will be provided. Training, TA, laboratory equipment&#13;
and drugs will also be provided in four women's consultations in Kaluga city to allow them to routinely&#13;
offer diagnosis and treatment of STIs. Health promotion activities for family planning and reproductive&#13;
health will be implemented by the Health Promotion Unit, with a budget of US$750,000.&#13;
3.36      Health Promotion and Professional Education. Only limited health promotion and health&#13;
education materials are currently available in Russia and there is little experience in implementing&#13;
educational programs that reach out effectively to the population. Under the project, a Health Promotion&#13;
Unit will be established in the oblast with responsibility to prepare communication strategies, identify&#13;
priorities, design specific campaigns, prepare and disseminate educational materials, and train&#13;
communication agents both within and outside the health system in health education. Project support for&#13;
health promotion activities will take two forms: institutional support for the HPU (including office&#13;
equipment, training of HPU staff and staff salaries), and funds reserved to cover the costs of strategic&#13;
planning, materials development and production, dissemination, and other field costs (US$250,000 for&#13;
antenatal care and US$750,000 for family planning). Disbursement of these latter funds will be&#13;
conditional on preparation of a five-year strategy for health promotion in MCH and an action plan&#13;
with detailed budget for the first year of implementation acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Part II: Tver Oblast Health Reform (Base Cost US$38.0 million)&#13;
Restructuring Cardiovascular Health Services (Base Cost US$12.6 million)&#13;
3.37      This component aims to develop a cost-effective package of interventions to reduce&#13;
cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most common cause of adult deaths in Tver Oblast. The component's&#13;
focus is on prevention. Component activities represent only the first steps in a long-term program to&#13;
change unhealthy lifestyles that result from difficult and sometimes despairing economic circumstances&#13;
and a lack of a sense of personal responsibility for one's health. The component also addresses the&#13;
immediate need for improved basic emergency care to cope with cardiovascular events when they do&#13;
occur, and provides limited diagnostic equipment at the Central Oblast Hospital. Although the focus is&#13;
on CVD, investments undertaken under this component would also enhance prevention, diagnosis and&#13;
treatment of other major health problems, especially accidents and trauma.&#13;
3.38      Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease. The oblast will begin its campaign against unhealthy&#13;
lifestyles will use all available channels for reaching the population. Primary and secondary prevention&#13;
programs will be based primarily at the level of the district therapist and family practice physician. The&#13;
campaign will focus on educating providers on the value of prevention and training them to deliver&#13;
effective preventive services. The campaign will also develop ways to directly inform and educate the&#13;
general populace with respect to cardiovascular risk factors and a healthy lifestyle. Targeted programs&#13;
aimed at enterprise employees and at diabetics (a high risk group for CVD) will also be included.&#13;
Program design and strategic development will be based on surveys on awareness and behavior of both&#13;
the population-at-large and providers. The following activities will be pursued:&#13;
(a) A health awareness survey to be carried out in the first project year will provide&#13;
a baseline and guide regarding awareness, general knowledge, and special&#13;
concerns about cardiovascular health and a healthier lifestyle. The Canadian&#13;
Government-financed project Health Canada has and will continue to participate&#13;
in the development and implementation of the survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 22                                                         Project Objectives and Description&#13;
(b) The existing Oblast Health Information Center will be expanded to serve several&#13;
new functions. The Center will assist in identifying priorities and designing four&#13;
or five major campaigns directed toward prevention of CVD.  The initial&#13;
campaign will address cigarette smoking in men. Both adults and teenagers will&#13;
be included in the target population.   Project support for health promotion&#13;
activities will take two forms: institutional support for the Center (including&#13;
office equipment, training of Center staff and staff salaries), and funds reserved&#13;
for materials developpment and production, dissemination, and other field costs&#13;
(US$1.0 million). Disbursement of these latter funds will be conditional on&#13;
preparation of a five-year strategy for promotion of cardiovascular health&#13;
and  an  action  plan, with  detailed  budget,   for the first year of&#13;
implementation, acceptable to the Bank. Health Canada will provide assistance&#13;
in long-range planning and campaign design and implementation of initial phases.&#13;
The Center will also assist representatives of various other subcomponents&#13;
(described below) such as the Ambulance Center, the Diabetes Center and the&#13;
Tver Medical Academy in preparation of teaching materials for patients and&#13;
students.&#13;
(c) Training and support for primary care providers. Conferences, seminars, and&#13;
faculty workshops will be held to create and implement changes in the&#13;
undergraduate curriculum and the continuing education programs for physicians,&#13;
as well as for feldshers and nurses. To help in the design of training programs,&#13;
practicing physicians will be assessed with respect to their health awareness&#13;
through a questionnaire and focus groups. Risk reduction courses for physicians&#13;
will be developed in order that they might experience first hand the techniques&#13;
of risk reduction, and in addition, better act as exemplars for their patients and&#13;
for the community in which they serve. Publications will be developed on&#13;
healthy life style and risk factors and will be made available as teaching aides.&#13;
The primary care physician's office will be a regular point of distribution.&#13;
(d) A health status inventory will be carried out on 3000 individuals in five&#13;
demonstration districts (the rayons of Rzhev, Kuvshinovo, Vyshny Volochek, and&#13;
two of four districts in the city of Tver) - including height, weight, blood&#13;
pressure, lipid profile, and blood sugar. The inventory will be repeated near the&#13;
end of the project to measure changes in health awareness and health status.&#13;
(e) A program to detect and reduce health risks in the enterprises has been developed&#13;
with the technical assistance of the WHO-sponsored CINDI Program. The&#13;
project will support a pilot effort at the carriage (railroad car) factory - the&#13;
largest employer in the oblast - which will include examining workers for&#13;
traditional risk factors and facilitating appropriate interventions such as smoking&#13;
cessation, hypertension treatment, and diet counseling.   The enterprise has&#13;
agreed to contribute one third of the cost of new equipment (estimated equipment&#13;
cost is US$70,000) and will pay additional salaries needed for the project and&#13;
provide necessary computer software.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Objectives and Description                                                  Page 23&#13;
(f) A Diabetes Center will be created and equipped. The Center's functions would&#13;
include outpatient treatment of high risk and severely affected diabetics and&#13;
coordination and development of educational programs for patients and physicians&#13;
at the rayons on detection and early effective treatment.&#13;
(g) Equipment for the early detection of cardiovascular risk factors (lipid measuring&#13;
equipment, EKGs, glucometers and portable ultrasound) will be placed in&#13;
hospitals and polyclinics throughout the oblast. EKGs and glucose meters will&#13;
also be provided to Family Physicians under a separate component of the project&#13;
(para. 3.49). In the five demonstration sites, additional training and equipment&#13;
(cycle ergometers, pulsometers, and Holter monitors) as well as computers and&#13;
software will also be provided to further upgrade prevention, detection, and&#13;
treatment.&#13;
3.39      The Tver Medical Academy, which will implement this sub-component, will create a new&#13;
position of Director of education for primary and secondary prevention to coordinate the above activities.&#13;
The TMA will work closely with the Oblast Health Information Center, which will produce educational&#13;
materials for providers and for patients and help prepare communication strategies. The Project would&#13;
provide support for the office of the Director for Prevention in the TMA to help him carry out his new&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
3.40      Emergency Care. Delivering appropriate care within the first hour after onset of acute&#13;
cardiovascular events can make a significant difference in the fatality or long-term consequences of such&#13;
events. This sub-component is directed towards the definitive treatment of these events at the lowest&#13;
possible level in the health care system.  The subcomponent focuses on two concepts: (a) the&#13;
reorganization and modernization of the ambulance service, and (b) the provision of training and&#13;
equipment needed to assure that appropriate treatment can be provided at the local level. Both of these&#13;
strategies will be implemented oblast-wide. Improvements under this subcomponent will also benefit&#13;
victims of other emergencies such as accidents and trauma.&#13;
3.41      Ambulance services are currently inefficiently organized, with various specialties each&#13;
maintaining separate ambulances. In addition, ambulances are used both for transporting patients in non-&#13;
emergency situations as well as for emergencies. Under the project, the ambulance service will be&#13;
restructured to provide two levels of service. The first level will be devoted to house calls and will&#13;
involve simple transport units supplied with the equipment and drugs needed to provide basic care. The&#13;
second level will respond to emergencies and will require more sophisticated ambulances supplied with&#13;
monitors, defibrillators, oxygen, and other appropriate equipment and drugs. These latter will be used&#13;
for all types of emergencies, excepting those with unusual requirements (e.g., neonates and psychiatric&#13;
patients). Forty-four reanimation ambulances will be purchased and distributed to each of 36 rayons and&#13;
the city of Tver. An additional 40 already in use will be reequipped to the same standards. Other (older)&#13;
ambulances in the oblast will be used as transport vehicles.  Communication equipment for the&#13;
Ambulance Dispatch Center will be supplemented or partially replaced. Purchase of the ambulances and&#13;
equipment will be done in two lots, separated by the shortest interval to reaffirm that the training program&#13;
is in place and the structural reforms have been implemented.&#13;
3.42      Almost 2000 emergency response physicians, feldshers, and nurses will be trained in&#13;
emergency care based on modules developed for Russia by the American International Health Alliance&#13;
(under an ongoing USAID-funded project). These emergency support teams will in turn train police and&#13;
firemen with respect to basic life support. All training will be organized by the Ambulance Center in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 24                                                      Project Objectives and Description&#13;
Tver City. The Oblast Health Information Center (para. 3.38(b)) will help develop training and&#13;
informational materials.&#13;
3.43      The issue of hospital emergency rooms is deliberately not addressed in the project because&#13;
of the complexities that would be involved in reorganizing hospital emergency services-'. Under the&#13;
present project, monitors, defibrillators, and temporary pacemakers will be placed in Intensive Care Units&#13;
in hospitals that are currently under-equipped. Mechanical ventilators and blood gas analyzers will be&#13;
placed in rayon/district hospitals in the ten most populous areas.&#13;
3.44      Diagnostic Enhancements. One ultrasound unit for the evaluation of peripheral blood vessels&#13;
and one CT scanner will be provided to the Central Oblast Hospital. These items of special equipment,&#13;
though expensive, are felt to be important for diagnosing and treating both CVD and other health care&#13;
needs of the population. The Oblast has neither a functioning CT nor an MRI. Such a piece of&#13;
equipment, with a suitable maintenance contract, is clearly necessary for a population base of 1.5 million.&#13;
The equipment would be used for the usual wide range of medical problems including oncology,&#13;
infectious disease, and head injury.&#13;
Family Medicine (Base Cost US$9.2 million)&#13;
3.45      This component would facilitate the introduction of family physicians as principal primary&#13;
caregivers, gradually replacing the "therapist". Building on a strong tradition of teaching at the Tver&#13;
Medical Academy (TMA), the component would (i) strengthen teaching capacity in the Academy, (ii) help&#13;
establish clinics for graduates of the retraining program for family physicians initiated in 1993, and (iii)&#13;
develop a network of Consultation, Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (CDTCs) to provide outpatient&#13;
referral support to the new family physicians.&#13;
3.46      Development of Family Medicine Education. The Tver Medical Academy is one of the oldest&#13;
and most highly respected medical education centers in Russia. Like other Russian medical schools, the&#13;
Academy has historically concentrated on preparing medical specialists rather than general practitioners.&#13;
However, in 1993, a curriculum in family medicine was launched with the assistance of a team of&#13;
Canadian advisors. The Academy is now one of an estimated 10 medical schools in Russia actively&#13;
involved in changing its emphasis toward preparing doctors in family medicine. In spite of its progress,&#13;
TMA still faces a number of challenges in developing its program in family medicine:&#13;
*  A "Chair of Family Medicine" needs to be established at a level comparable to&#13;
other academic departments within the Academy.&#13;
*  The curriculum in Family Medicine needs to be refined, especially through the&#13;
introduction of advanced methods and materials for teaching family medicine.&#13;
*  Faculty from the Academy need to become better qualified to serve as teachers&#13;
and trainers in family medicine.&#13;
5' At present, hospitals in Russia do not have emergency rooms as they are known in other&#13;
countries. Rather, there are admission rooms where triage is performed. Patients are then sent&#13;
directly to the relevant specialty department. The Bank-funded Community Social Infrastructure&#13;
Project (para. 2.7) addresses emergency room restructuring on a pilot basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Objectives and Description                                                  Page 25&#13;
3.47      The project would provide support for development in these three areas. International experts&#13;
in family medicine practice and education will provide technical assistance for organizational development&#13;
of the Chair, elaboration of the conceptual model of practice, design of demonstration clinics for training,&#13;
curriculum design and preparation of teaching faculty. Local experts will also be invited to lecture,&#13;
advise, and generally support the Chair's activities. Foreign and local training will be offered for select&#13;
faculty. Funds will also be made available for acquisition and dissemination of professional literature and&#13;
participation in professional conferences. The Tver Medical Academy will work closely with the Moscow&#13;
Sechenov Medical Academy which is receiving project support to strengthen a national training program&#13;
in Family Medicine (paras. 3.70-3.76).&#13;
3.48      A Family Medicine Teaching Clinic will be organized as part of a CDTC to be located on&#13;
the same premises as the Chair's offices. A second teaching clinic will be established at another site still&#13;
to be determined but likely within an existing polyclinic. Cost of construction and furnishing of the&#13;
Chair's offices constitute part of the local contribution to the project. Equipment will be provided to&#13;
support the activities of the Chair and its teaching clinics.&#13;
3.49      Establishment of Family Medicine Clinics. The first doctors qualified in family medicine will&#13;
graduate in late 1995, with about ten graduates expected each year over the next few years. Over the&#13;
life of the project, Tver Medical Academy and the Tver Regional Health Authority plan to establish up&#13;
to fifty family medicine clinics at locations throughout Tver Oblast. To achieve these objectives, the&#13;
project will support: clinic renovation; technical assistance for development of training workshops on&#13;
clinic organization and management and for offering direct advice to the first few graduates setting up&#13;
offices: a basic package of medical equipment and limited supplemental equipment for doctors in remote&#13;
rural areas or where diagnostic support is not readily available. There are no plans under the project to&#13;
transfer ownership of assets in these clinics to family practitioners. Hence the equipment will remain&#13;
public property.&#13;
3.50      Given the importance of maintaining a stable, adequate source of financing for primary care&#13;
services, the oblast agreed (as a legal covenant of the project) to increase recurrent expenditures for&#13;
outpatient services as a share of total oblast recurrent expenditures for health (including THIF and&#13;
oblast budget expenditures) to at least the following levels: in 1999, to 35 percent; in 2000, to 40&#13;
percent; in 2001, to 45 percent, and in 2002, to 50 percent. In addition, the oblast agreed to ensure&#13;
that (i) during each year the health budget as a share of the total budget (including oblast budget,&#13;
rayon budgets and municipal budgets) shall be no less than during the previous year; (ii) the actual&#13;
health expenditures as a share of total expenditures shall be no less than the health budget as a&#13;
share of the total budget for the respective year; and (iii) furnish to the Project CSU adequate&#13;
information to monitor compliance with points (i) and (ii).&#13;
3.51      Establishment of Consultation, Diagnostic, and Treatment Centers (CDTCs). Family doctors&#13;
need ready access to supportive diagnostic services and easy referral links with medical specialists.&#13;
Accordingly, funds will be provided for the medical equipment necessary to upgrade six polyclinics to&#13;
CDTCs, with preference given to those associated with teaching clinics of the TMA and rayon hospitals&#13;
in the project demonstration sites. (See para. 3.8 for further discussion of CDTCs).&#13;
Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning (Base Cost US$11.2 million)&#13;
3.52      This component would introduce changes in clinical practice standards, building on the&#13;
recommendations of the federal-level MCH/FP Work Group, and create the physical environment to&#13;
support these changes. It is similar in concept to the MCH/FP component of the Kaluga Oblast Sub-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 26                                                         Project Objectives and Description&#13;
project described in paras. 3.27-3.36, with project inputs tailored to local conditions and priorities in Tver&#13;
Oblast. It has five sub-components: antenatal care; Baby-Friendly Hospitals; the Rzhev Inter-rayon&#13;
Perinatal Center; and Family Planning and Reproductive Health.&#13;
3.53       Antenatal Care. A center to coordinate health promotion and professional training activities&#13;
in antenatal care will be established in Maternity Home #5. The center will develop patient education&#13;
materials and mass media campaigns, offer antenatal classes for expecting parents, and train obstetrician-&#13;
gynecologists and midwives in antenatal care and counseling.  Routine vitamin and iron folate&#13;
supplementation for pregnant women will be introduced in the oblast. The supplements will be procured&#13;
through the project. A budget of US$700,000 is reserved under this subcomponent for development,&#13;
production and dissemination of health promotion materials. Disbursement of these funds as well as&#13;
similar funds reserved under the Family Planning Subcomponent (para. 3.60) will be conditioned&#13;
on preparation of a five-year strategy for health promotion in MCH and preparation of an action&#13;
plan, with detailed budget, for the first year of implementation acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.54       Baby-Friendly Hospitals.  Baby-friendly hospitals will be created in 20 rayons and five&#13;
maternity homes in Tver City through provider training, field visits, and provision of necessary&#13;
equipment. Training in basic neonatal resuscitation and basic equipment for resuscitation will be provided&#13;
to all participating maternity homes/departments, and further upgrading will be provided in the Neonatal&#13;
ICU of the Oblast Children's Hospital and Tver Municipal Children's Hospital #1, which serve as referral&#13;
centers for seriously ill babies.&#13;
3.55       Rzhev Inter-rayon Perinatal Center. This Center will bring together obstetric and neonatal&#13;
functions in one facility that will serve as the primary maternity home and perinatal center for Rzhev city&#13;
and as a referral center for nine neighboring rayons. The Center introduces a new organizing concept&#13;
of care for high-risk deliveries and seriously ill neonates, with mother and child kept together in the same&#13;
facility rather than transferring the sick child from maternity home to children's hospital (para. 3.27).&#13;
This approach increases survival chances of new-borns, and reduces duplication of facilities.&#13;
3.56       The Center also introduces a regionalized approach to perinatal care that encourages the&#13;
treatment of low risk pregnant women and infants in local rayon centers and referral of high risk patients&#13;
to perinatal centers. A regionalized system of perinatal care includes:&#13;
* Rayon maternity departments.&#13;
* Inter-rayon/oblast perinatal centers.&#13;
* High-level specialized care in one or two facilities nationwide (not included in the project).&#13;
3.57       Once the perinatal center is established (end of year two), about 80 obstetric beds (out of 193&#13;
total) will be closed in the surrounding rayons, including closure of three obstetric departments. It is also&#13;
expected that as a result of the creation of this center, length of stay for routine pregnancies will decline&#13;
and referral rates to Tver city will drop.&#13;
3.58       The project will finance necessary civil works, equipment, training, drugs, and supplies for&#13;
the establishment and operation of the facility. Civil works have been underway using local funds to&#13;
build a new maternity home building in Rzhev, which would be linked to the current facility which dates&#13;
to the 1930s. At present, the shell of the new building is in place, but interior works have been stopped&#13;
to allow for a redesign of the entire complex.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Objectives and Description                                                     Page 27&#13;
3.59      The project will finance the completion of civil works at Rhzev according to a new design&#13;
that is compatible with western concepts of hospital design as well as modern concepts of perinatal care.&#13;
This includes the construction of a small new building to house reception and day-care facilities to&#13;
provide diagnostic and follow-up treatments in a low-cost setting. In addition to the integration of&#13;
obstetric and neonatal functions, the new design will accommodate rooming-in on a large scale. The new&#13;
design will also end the practice of duplicating labor, delivery, surgical, and post-delivery facilities for&#13;
"pathology" and normal patients in exchange for several isolation rooms to care for infectious patients.&#13;
Equipment and personnel will be shared between the obstetric units to the extent that modern practices&#13;
allow, greatly increasing allocative efficiency. In the nursery, capacity will be enhanced to care for all&#13;
but the most severely ill babies, the practice of cohorting infants in the nursery will be ended, and the&#13;
duplication of facilities for premature and sick, full-term babies will be eliminated. As in the obstetrics&#13;
functions, equipment and personnel will be shared between nursery units.&#13;
3.60      Family Planning and Reproductive Health. A center to coordinate health promotion and&#13;
professional education activities in family planning and reproductive health will be created in Maternity&#13;
Home #2. The center will prepare patient education materials and mass media campaigns and organized&#13;
training programs for obstetrician-gynecologists and, later in the project, for family physicians and other&#13;
providers. A budget of US$700,000 is set aside for health promotion activities under this sub-component,&#13;
subject to the same conditionalities as those for antenatal care (para. 3.53). Laboratory capacity will be&#13;
enhanced in the same facility for testing for sexually transmitted disease and infertility. A teen center&#13;
will be established in the multiprofile polyclinic attached to Municipal Hospital #4, where free&#13;
contraceptives will be made available to teens aged 15-21.&#13;
Restructuring Provider Incentives (Base Cost US$3.1 million)&#13;
3.61      This component would provide support for development and implementation of improved&#13;
provider payment, quality assurance and management information systems.&#13;
3.62      Provider Payment.  In January 1994, the old budget-based system in hospitals and the&#13;
polyclinics attached to them was replaced by a system of paying for finished cases and visits for facilities&#13;
financed through the THIF. Because the system was not capped and incentives to promote outpatient care&#13;
were not introduced, inpatient expenditures have increased substantially.&#13;
3.63      To correct these problems, the Fund has focused on improved recording of cost information&#13;
to refine its pricing structure and to better ascertain 'efficient' costs so that limits could be established&#13;
on various cost elements. However, both the Oblast Health Authorities and the Fund now recognize that&#13;
these changes would not be far-reaching enough to get at the major problem of the hospital-based&#13;
orientation of the system and would like to broaden provider payment reform to attain a more balanced&#13;
package of incentives for in- and out-patient services. They have now begun working with international&#13;
and Russian experts provided through USAID funding and hope to identify their choices and test them&#13;
in pilot facilities over the coming year.&#13;
3.64      Five pilot sites have been selected to represent conditions at oblast-wide, municipal, and rayon&#13;
levels: the Children's Hospital, Polyclinic #1 ("Medsanchast"), and City Hospital and polyclinic #6 in&#13;
Tver City; and Central Hospitals and Polyclinics in the Rayons of Kuvshinovo and Vyshny Volochek.&#13;
Four of the five sites (excluding the Oblast Children's Hospital) are paid by the THIF. Rayon-wide pilots&#13;
are envisaged in Kuvshinovo and Vyshny Volochek Rayons. All these facilities have progressive reform-&#13;
minded managers and the capacity and interest to implement payment reforms. Pilot design and testing,&#13;
with assistance from USAID-funded experts, is expected to be completed by October 1996. Pilot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 28                                                       Project Objectives and Description&#13;
activities will be implemented through the first three years of the project. An evaluation of pilot activities&#13;
will be carried out in Year 4. By the fifth year of the project, the system will be implemented oblast-&#13;
wide.&#13;
3.65      Oblast and Fund officials are also receiving TA, training and software under the USAID&#13;
program to improve their quality assurance systems. They are particularly interested in developing&#13;
quality indicators that can be combined with financial information, and that can be used to assess quality&#13;
within individual hospital departments, and for individual institutions, both hospitals and polyclinics. The&#13;
computer hardware and software as well as assistance for systems development needed to implement&#13;
provider payment and quality assurance systems will be procured as part of the MIS activities in this&#13;
component. The project also includes funds for additional TA and training to take place during&#13;
implementation, after the USAID project is ended.&#13;
3.66      Management Information Systems (MIS). The Territorial Fund, in collaboration with the&#13;
Oblast Health Authority, would like to develop a consolidated information system that merges financial,&#13;
utilization, practice and demographic information from the level of the individual patient and individual&#13;
practitioner up to the oblast level. An Information Processing Center (IPC) in the oblast (to be&#13;
established in a facility owned by the Oblast Health Authority) will link the Territorial Fund, the Oblast&#13;
Health Authority, and individual facilities in a parallel processing client server network patterned after&#13;
similar systems in Samara, St. Petersburg and Kemerovo Oblasts. The system would cover the following&#13;
applications: territorial fund financial tracking; provider payment processing; utilization and practice&#13;
management; quality assurance; actuarial modeling for development of service and payment norms;&#13;
ambulatory care patient registration; hospital discharge; and monitoring project activities.&#13;
3.67      Project funds would be used to develop and test the individual applications in 14 different&#13;
sites and link them through the IPC. The full set of applications will be tested in the five sites designated&#13;
for testing of new provider payment mechanisms (para. 3.64). A more limited set of applications&#13;
including mainly administrative functions will be tested in the remaining nine sites. Pilot testing will take&#13;
place during the first four years of the project, in parallel with testing of new provider payment and&#13;
quality assurance systems. USAID-funded TA has been provided for MIS development, particularly for&#13;
design of the pilot phase, but additional funds (US$400,000) are available in the project for development&#13;
of custom  application programs.   Project funds will also be used to procure hardware and&#13;
telecommunications equipment for the IPC and the 14 participating facilities.&#13;
3.68      Once pilot testing is completed, probably starting in the fifth project year, full implementation&#13;
of the system in 86 major institutions is planned. Project funds will be used to procure hardware and&#13;
software for around 200 workstations in these institutions, and any additional TA for systems&#13;
development that may be needed at that time as well as for training of system users.&#13;
3.69      Development and implementation of such comprehensive, interactive information systems that&#13;
combine clinical, economic, and demographic data and are designed for different uses by multiple&#13;
stakeholders in the health system (e.g. governments, insurers, physicians, hospital administrators, etc.)&#13;
have often resulted in costly and difficult technical obstacles. The oblast's decision to intensively&#13;
experiment in a number of sites prior to more widespread adoption of the system is a sensible one.&#13;
Because the introduction of new provider incentives is at the core of the oblast's efforts to improve&#13;
the efficiency and quality of health services, completion of detailed plans acceptable to the Bank for&#13;
the pilot phase of the Provider Incentives Component, including provider payment and MIS pilots,&#13;
will be a condition of disbursement on all components of the Tver Oblast Sub-project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Project Objectives and Description                                                 Page 29&#13;
Part III: National Training Program in Faniily Medicine (Base Cost US$2.8 million)&#13;
3.70      An enhanced role for primary care providers is at the heart of restructuring health care&#13;
delivery in Russia. To this end, Russia will need to carry out massive retraining of physicians and nurses&#13;
already in place, of which there are a few hundred thousand, to upgrade their skills in providing family-&#13;
centered health care at the primary level. The study of Family Medicine will also be promoted as a&#13;
specialty area open to new graduates in medical faculties. This component would support development&#13;
of training programs in family-centered care at the Moscow Sechenov Medical Academy (MMA), the&#13;
country's leading training institution in the field of Family Medicine, and in Kaluga and Tver. The&#13;
MMA will coordinate closely with the Tver Medical Academy which is responsible for training in Family&#13;
Medicine in the Tver Oblast Sub-project. In addition, the MMA will assist Kaluga Oblast in developing&#13;
a Training Center for Family Medicine to support implementation of the Family Medicine program under&#13;
the component "Delivery System Restructuring" in the Kaluga Oblast Sub-project. The MMA's&#13;
association with Tver and Kaluga would help them develop methods of cooperation with oblasts of two&#13;
different profiles: those that have Medical Universities with full teaching faculties and facilities (as in&#13;
Tver); and those without such Universities (as in Kaluga) where training programs will need to be&#13;
adopted to local circumstances and resources.&#13;
3.71      The component will have four subcomponents: designing models of family practice well&#13;
adopted to Russian circumstances, curriculum and faculty development, including the establishment of&#13;
teaching clinics in selected areas throughout the country; establishing standards for quality improvement&#13;
and certification; and creating a supportive environment for the practice of Family Medicine in Russia.&#13;
All subcomponents will be developed in close conjunction with the two pilot oblasts during the first three&#13;
years of the project. After the mid-term evaluation in Year 4, these activities will be disseminated to an&#13;
additional six oblasts, either with or without Medical Academies.&#13;
3.72      Updating Models of Practice. A conceptual model of professional practice for doctors and&#13;
nurses in the field of Family Medicine has been proposed under MOH order number 237 of 26 August&#13;
1992 which creates the practice of Family Medicine in Russia. This model draws heavily from&#13;
international experience and now needs to be further adapted to Russia's unique cultural and economic&#13;
conditions on the basis of practical experience. This experience will be gained as the first graduates of&#13;
(re)training programs in Family Medicine return to their practices in 1997 and the next years. The&#13;
revised conceptual model would describe the populations to be served by family practitioners, the services&#13;
they will provide, their referral relationships with other primary care physicians and with specialists, and&#13;
their roles within polyclinics and hospitals. Once defined, revised models of family practice can be used&#13;
as guides for developing appropriate training programs, designing supportive work environments,&#13;
identifying needed equipment, providing supportive staff, creating appropriate financing mechanisms, and&#13;
even shaping public policy.&#13;
3.73      Curriculum and Faculty Development. Based on the models of family medicine practice,&#13;
model programs for the training and retraining of family doctors and nurses at the undergraduate and&#13;
graduate levels will be developed. The training models will define guidelines that can be used by&#13;
educational institutions throughout Russia and adapted to local needs and conditions. Guidelines would&#13;
include criteria for determining admission policies, educational goals, curricula, teaching materials and&#13;
methods, financing mechanisms, and relationships with other medical school faculties. Teaching faculty&#13;
who are proficient in the theory and practice of family-centered health care will be prepared. Teaching&#13;
materials and resources will be collected, translated, and adapted to local requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 30                                                      Project Objectives and Description&#13;
3.74      Ouality Improvement and Certification.  A program  will be established to encourage&#13;
continuous improvement in the quality of training and the care provided by family doctors and nurses.&#13;
The program will include: evaluation of the professional proficiency of family doctors and nurses through&#13;
a system of accreditation and certification; accreditation of educational programs; and creation of a&#13;
professional association of family practitioners.&#13;
3.75      Creating a Supportive Environment.  The task of expanding family-centered health care in&#13;
Russia faces numerous challenges, not least of which is raising the status of primary care physicians. To&#13;
create a political and social environment that encourages and supports family centered health care, The&#13;
MMA will organize a public awareness campaign to popularize family medicine among the public and&#13;
health care workers. This campaign will be patterned after similar successful campaigns carried out in&#13;
other countries, adopted to Russian circumstances.&#13;
3.76      Through the project, the Academy will establish a "partnership" arrangement with a&#13;
prominent training institution abroad. This partner institution will of necessity be located in a country&#13;
where the teaching of family medicine is considered to be an appropriate model for Russia. During&#13;
appraisal, MMA and Tver Medical Academy which also plans to contract international technical&#13;
assistance for its Family Medicine Component (para. 3.47) agreed to jointly contract one partner&#13;
institution to ensure consistency in their programs and minimize costs. The costs of TA under the&#13;
partnership arrangement and smaller free-standing consultancies, study visits and participation in local&#13;
and international conferences by faculty in the MMA and other training institutions, and acquisition of&#13;
scientific literature and teaching materials will be financed under this component. Finally, support will&#13;
be provided for equipment in one teaching clinic each in Moscow and Kaluga. Support for two teaching&#13;
clinics in Tver is included under the Family Medicine Component of the Tver Oblast Sub-project.&#13;
Participating institutions are expected to take responsibility for renovation of these clinics as part of local&#13;
contribution to the project.&#13;
Part IV: Monitoring, Evaluation and Dissemination (Base Cost US$1.4 million)&#13;
3.77      This component provides the resources to maximize the multiplier effect expected from the&#13;
pilot experience. To fully realize the expected returns to investments in this project, monitoring,&#13;
evaluation and dissemination of project results are essential. In such an exercise, three target audiences&#13;
are involved. First, the primary beneficiaries of the investment itself, namely the two oblasts and the&#13;
MMA, which have an interest in following progress with implementation and the effectiveness of their&#13;
investment, most importantly to signal any need for adjustments and corrections as and when it arises.&#13;
Second, the MOH which has a responsibility for overall coordination of health reform efforts in the&#13;
country, for offering support and guidance to the initiators of reform and for facilitating exchange of&#13;
information among the various actors in the sector. Third, other oblasts, organizations, institutions, etc.&#13;
in the country, that will want to benefit from the experience of the project's pilot activities and share their&#13;
own experiences.&#13;
3.78      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E).  The M&amp;E scheme for the project consists of a&#13;
combination of activities including routine data collection and review carried out principally by project&#13;
beneficiaries; periodic assessments of project activities and their outcomes carried out jointly by&#13;
beneficiaries, the World Bank and third party observers; and population-based surveys to evaluate project&#13;
outcomes. Project outcomes will be evaluated in terms of their impact on: (i) quality of services; (ii)&#13;
consumer and provider satisfaction with the reforms; (iii) health status; and (iv) cost effectiveness. M&amp;E&#13;
activities include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Objectives and Description                                                  Page 31&#13;
(a) Routine Monitoring. An implementation plan and a list of indicators to track&#13;
progress in implementing activities under each component has been developed.&#13;
These lists are attached to the individual component reports and will be included&#13;
in the Project Operating Manual. They will be used by component and project&#13;
managers on a routine basis to ensure progress and make necessary adjustments.&#13;
(b) Monitoring of Key Indicators. A short list of key indicators (Annex 5.1) to be&#13;
tracked annually will form the basis for measuring project success. These&#13;
indicators have been identified as best representing the most important targets of&#13;
individual project components, whether process, output or outcome. All project&#13;
beneficiaries agreed (as a legal covenant of the project) to report on the&#13;
status of these key indicators to the World Bank on an annual basis.&#13;
(c) Year 1 Evaluation. After the first year of implementation, the first complete&#13;
review of project activities is planned, to coincide with the Bank's supervision&#13;
mission. Questions of implementation capacity and project management will be&#13;
the focus of this review.  If any serious problems resulting from  project&#13;
complexity have emerged at this stage, project restructuring could be considered.&#13;
(d) Mid-Term Evaluation. At the mid-point of project implementation (around three&#13;
years after start-up) a more fundamental assessment of overall as well as&#13;
component-specific project design, implementation, feasibility, replicability and&#13;
sustainability will be carried out. This evaluation would determine (i) the extent&#13;
to which the project is meeting its stated objectives; (ii) whether or not the&#13;
project design continues to be the appropriate means of achieving those&#13;
objectives; and (iii) whether specific implementation issues need to be addressed.&#13;
This can serve as another point for restructuring the project if necessary.&#13;
(e) Final Evaluation. During the sixth year of project implementation, overall&#13;
achievements of the project will be reviewed and its shortcomings assessed. The&#13;
evaluation will focus on lessons learned for future projects. In Tver Oblast, the&#13;
health status inventory planned for the first year of the project under the CVD&#13;
Component will be repeated during the fifth or sixth year to measure changes in&#13;
health awareness and health status (para. 3.38(a)).&#13;
3.79      Given the critical implications of the mid-term and final reviews for country-wide health&#13;
reform, the MOH will take direct responsibility for these activities and has designated the Public Health&#13;
Institute NPO MedSocEconomInform (MSEI) to carry this out on its behalf. The mid-term review will&#13;
be carried out by a joint-team of local and foreign experts, with the MOH or its representatives (MSEI&#13;
and/or others as designated by the Ministry) participating on the local side. MSEI, in consultation with&#13;
project beneficiaries and in agreement with the Bank, will organize a team of international experts that&#13;
will participate in the mid-term review. MSEI will also participate in the first year review, and carry out&#13;
the final project review. TA and related costs for the mid-term and final evaluations of the project are&#13;
included under this component.&#13;
3.80      Costs of data collection of routine and key project indicators are included in the respective&#13;
components and sub-projects as well as the respective Project Management Units, as an indication that&#13;
primary responsibility for these activities rests with these units. To unify and standardize M&amp;E activities&#13;
in the project as a whole, MSEI will develop a data base for project evaluation (combining monitoring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 32                                                         Project Objectives and Description&#13;
indicators with data from surveys and other data sources) and organize a training workshop on monitoring&#13;
and evaluation methodologies for relevant oblast and MMA staff and annual workshops to review the&#13;
status of key indicators and to upgrade evaluation skills. Study visits for oblast, MMA, and MSEI staff&#13;
on project evaluation methods will also be organized under this component. Finally, building on its&#13;
experience in guiding and participating in M&amp;E activities for this project, MSEI will offer similar&#13;
services for other health projects in the country during the second half of the project.&#13;
3.81       Dissemination and Replication (D&amp;R). D&amp;R activities have the following objectives: (a) to&#13;
disseminate results of pilot activities undertaken under the project to other territories in the Federation;&#13;
these activities could include dissemination of results from similar pilots taking place elsewhere in the&#13;
country; (b) on the basis of findings of M&amp;E activities, as well as reviews of related activities taking&#13;
place in other similar experiments, to determine whether parts or all of the interventions undertaken under&#13;
the project or elsewhere can and should be replicated in other parts of the country; and (c) if so, to design&#13;
appropriate mechanisms (organizational, financial, technical) by which such replication should take place&#13;
and, if appropriate, prepare proposals, or assist interested oblasts/territories in preparing proposals for&#13;
funding through federal, local or external funds including a possible follow-up World Bank-assisted&#13;
project.&#13;
3.82       Dissemination of project experience will be carried out through a series of dissemination&#13;
workshops on: (a) the proposed new protocols for MCH developed in Lubertsy during project preparation&#13;
(para. 2.5) and adapted for the two pilot oblasts (Year One); (b) preliminary results of provider payment,&#13;
MIS and QA pilot activities in Kaluga and Tver (Year Two); (c) workshops on individual project&#13;
components and on the project as a whole following the mid-term review. Component support will also&#13;
include a semi-annual project bulletin and publications of workshop proceedings. The MOH, through&#13;
MSEI, will be directly responsible for these activities. In all cases, MSEI will ensure participation by&#13;
project implementing units as well as other research or operational units involved in related projects, so&#13;
as to create an environment of collaboration (as well as open debate) in the development of a health&#13;
reform program in the country.&#13;
3.83       To strengthen its institutional capacity and help it carry out the above M&amp;E and D&amp;R&#13;
responsibilities, MSEI will develop a partnership with an international institution with expertise in&#13;
monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of similar health reform projects. In addition, it will receive&#13;
support for the purchase of computers, software, and internet link-up and library materials.&#13;
C. Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.84       This is a category "C" project. No adverse environmental impacts are anticipated.&#13;
Participating facilities would be required to certify that physical plant meets established federal safety&#13;
standards before ordering equipment which is subject to such standards.&#13;

IV. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
4.1       The Borrower (the Russian Federation) is represented by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and&#13;
the Ministry of Health (MOH). The MOF and the MOH would delegate the management and&#13;
implementation responsibilities over the Project to the Oblast Administrations of Tver and Kaluga,&#13;
Moscow Sechenov Medical Academy (MMA) and to the Public Health Institute MedSocEconomIlnform&#13;
(MSEI) of the Federal Ministry of Health (MOH). All project Sub-borrowers are juridically independent&#13;
from each other and are located at geographically different parts of the country, which makes it extremely&#13;
important to set up a proper structure for overall project coordination and management.&#13;
4.2       To provide overall coordination among the four sub-projects, a Project Advisory Committee&#13;
(PAC), headed by the First Deputy Minister of MOH, was set up in September 1995. All Sub-borrowers&#13;
were represented on this committee and played an active role during the final stage of the project&#13;
preparation. In April 1996 a Central Support Unit (CSU), based in Moscow, was established to&#13;
coordinate day-to-day project activities and to address jointly issues and problems that may arise regarding&#13;
the Bank rules and procedures which are unfamiliar to the project beneficiaries.&#13;
4.3      In August 1996, the MOF informed the Bank of Government's decision to merge the&#13;
management units for the Medical Equipment Project and for the Health Reform Pilot Project. The&#13;
management restructuring process is almost completed. Both units are part of the Russian Health Care&#13;
Foundation which was registered at the Federal Ministry of Justice as an independent legal entity on&#13;
November 29, 1996. The Director of the CSU is a Deputy to the General Director of the Foundation&#13;
with signing authority on HRPP documents. The Foundation would have two Special Accounts, one for&#13;
each project. The CSU would be responsible for the day-to-day coordination of project activities with the&#13;
participating oblasts, MMA and MSEI; coordinating and managing procurement; arranging TA for&#13;
supervision of all civil works contracts financed out of the loan proceeds under ICB and NCB procedures;&#13;
maintaining the HRPP Special Account and managing all disbursements under the proposed project; and&#13;
complying with the reporting and auditing requirements detailed in the Loan Agreement. Given the&#13;
geographic dispersion of the beneficiaries, the CSU would also serve as a common liaison channel with&#13;
the World Bank and generator of the project reports to be submitted to the Bank. Terms-of-Reference of&#13;
the CSU are described in detail in Annex 3. A draft of the Foundation Organizational Manual, an internal&#13;
document describing the relationship between the two units; division of responsibilities between the&#13;
General Director of the Foundation and the HRPP Director; Foundation staffing, including the shared&#13;
services (accounting, disbursement) has been prepared by a consultant financed out of PHRD funds and&#13;
is currently under Bank and Government review. The mechanism of CSU financing, including payment&#13;
of taxes, has been discussed with the Ministry of Finance and it was agreed that the MOF would&#13;
reimburse the CSU for taxes and duties expenditures related to Project implementation. Draft of Project&#13;
Coordination Agreement between the Russian Health Care Foundation and the Federal Government was&#13;
discussed at negotiations. Signing of the Project Coordination Agreement between the Russian Health&#13;
Care Foundation and Federal Government is a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
4.4       The Advisory Committee has been renamed the Health Reform Steering Committee and would&#13;
act as an advisory body for the Project. It consists of the representatives of the following agencies: MOH&#13;
Division of Medical Care for the Population, MOH Division of Cooperation with WHO and other&#13;
International Organizations, MedSocEconomInform, Moscow Sechenov Medical Academy, Federal Health&#13;
Insurance Fund, Chairman of the Tver Oblast Project Coordination Committee, Chairman of the Kaluga&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 34                                              Project Management and Implementation&#13;
Oblast Project Coordination Committee, Tver THIF, Kaluga THIF and Tver Medical Academy. Terms&#13;
of Reference are described in Annex 3.2.&#13;
4.5       The project management structure is shown on Chart 4.1.&#13;
B. Management in the Project Oblasts&#13;
4.6       Implementation of the Kaluga and Tver sub-projects would be the responsibility of the Oblast&#13;
Administration of each oblast. Management teams in each oblast consist of a Project Coordination&#13;
Committee (PCC) and a Project Management Unit (PMU). The PCC would carry out general supervision&#13;
of sub-project implementation. Committee membership consists of high-ranking oblast health officials&#13;
who led respective component teams in the design and preparation of sub-project components. They&#13;
would be responsible for the development of methodology, resolving conceptual questions and any&#13;
necessary updating/adjusting of component design as sub-project implementation proceeds. The PCC&#13;
would be chaired by the Deputy Governor responsible for the social and/or health sector of each Oblast.&#13;
4.7       PMUs would coordinate the day-to-day implementation of sub-project components. Each&#13;
PMU would be established based on the Governor's decree and would have independent juridical status.&#13;
The PMU Director would report to the Chairman of the PCC. PMU staff, all working full time on the&#13;
project, would consist of component coordinators (one per component), civil engineers for the period&#13;
of construction works carried out under the project, an accountant and support staff. Component&#13;
coordinators would work closely with and under the supervision of the corresponding members of the&#13;
Oblast Project Coordination Committee.&#13;
C. Management at the Federal Level&#13;
4.8       Federal level sub-projects, viz. the National Family Medicine Program and the Monitoring,&#13;
Evaluation, and Dissemination Component, would be implemented respectively by the Moscow Sechenov&#13;
Medical Academy and MedSocEconomIlnform. Implementation of the National Family Medicine Program&#13;
is based in the Faculty of Family Medicine and would be carried out in close cooperation with Tver&#13;
Medical Academy and Kaluga Health Department. The MMA's Component coordinator would manage&#13;
the Family Medicine Sub-project. MMA staff would be reassigned to carry out all the activities planned&#13;
for this component, no additional staff is required for Sub-project management. Similarly, MSEI has&#13;
sufficient institutional capacity to implement the MED Component, and only one full time coordinator&#13;
would be appointed as a consultant to MSEI for overall component coordination and management. MSEI&#13;
staff involved in component development and preparation would continue to be responsible for its&#13;
'implementation.&#13;
D. Project Implementation Responsibilities&#13;
4.9       Institutional as well as individual responsibilities for implementation of project components&#13;
and activities are summarized in Annex 3.&#13;

E. Status of Preparation&#13;
4.10      During technical discussions held in March 1997 prior to negotiations, an agreement was&#13;
reached on the final design and estimated cost of all project activities and the project's financing plan.&#13;
At negotiations, MOF, MOH and Project Beneficiaries have agreed on the terms of the loan funds&#13;
transfer. Drafts of on-lending agreements for both oblasts have been prepared and discussed at&#13;
negotiations. The Federal Government has confirmed that loan funds would be passed on as grants to&#13;
federal level beneficiaries (including the CSU).&#13;
4.11      All key actions required to ensure timely start-up of implementation of the Project have been&#13;
completed prior to negotiations. The Project Preparation Facility (PPF) approved by the Bank in July&#13;
1996 was countersigned by the Government and authorization from the MOF for opening of the Special&#13;
Account for the PPF has been obtained. The Central Support Unit and oblast Project Management Units&#13;
have been established as independent juridical entities and recruitment of key personnel is underway.&#13;
Three major contracts for in-country training during the first year of implementation have been signed&#13;
between the Oblast Health departments and respective national training institutions. Short list and bidding&#13;
documents for selection of the procurement consulting firm have been prepared by the Borrower and&#13;
submitted to the Bank for no-objection. Letters of Invitation for two major institutional partnerships&#13;
scheduled to start during the first year of implementation (for the Family Medicine, and Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation components) have been sent to the short listed firms and institutions. Proposals for the latter&#13;
component have already been received. Technical documents for civil works on the Rzhev Inter-rayon&#13;
perinatal center in Tver Oblast have been prepared by the Borrower and passed to the Bank for no-&#13;
objection. The complete bidding documents would be prepared by the procurement consulting firm after&#13;
its selection and contract signing.&#13;
4.12      Equipment and drug lists for the various project activities have been prepared by the project&#13;
Beneficiaries and now are being reviewed by the Bank. According to the project's implementation&#13;
schedule, procurement of goods would start only in the second year of the project. Preparation of the first&#13;
set of bidding documents is not anticipated until March-April, 1998.&#13;
4.13      A Japan Grant Facility has been available for project preparation. It will continue to be used&#13;
to speed up project start-up activities. A PPF in the amount of US$ 729,000 is available to start the&#13;
project implementation.&#13;

Page 38                                  Project Costs, Financing,Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
5.2       Project costs have been estimated in US dollars because of the difficulty in forecasting&#13;
inflation rates for local currency. The costs for Civil Works, Goods (medical, laboratory, office&#13;
equipment, pharmaceuticals, furniture, vehicles and supplies) and Services, including local and overseas&#13;
training have been based on current prices and recent fees paid in similar projects financed by the Bank&#13;
and other donor agencies in the Russian Federation. Costs for foreign consulting and technical services&#13;
have been estimated on the basis of the cost of fees, accommodation and subsistence in the Russian&#13;
Federation and include fees, subsistence, transportation, and other miscellaneous fees. Cost estimates for&#13;
local fees and salaries, translation and interpretation services, health promotion programs, local training&#13;
and other operating costs have been based on current costs or costing standards provided by the Moscow&#13;
Sechenov Medical Academy (MMA) and the Health Administrations of the Oblasts participating in the&#13;
project which were found acceptable by Bank staff. Base cost estimates reflect prices in August 1996.&#13;
Foreign Exchange Component&#13;
5.3       The foreign exchange component was estimated as follows: (a) civil works, 25 %; (b) medical&#13;
and computer equipment; spare parts and supplies, 90 %; (c) pharmaceuticals, 80 %; (d) foreign consulting&#13;
and technical services, overseas study tours and fellowships, 100%; (e) local consulting services and&#13;
locally conducted training, 0%; (f) local health promotion programs, 25%; (g) local seminars and&#13;
workshops, 10%; and (h) incremental operating costs, 40%. The foreign exchange component is&#13;
estimated at US$48.6 million including contingencies, or 49% of total project costs.&#13;
Contingency Allowances&#13;
5.4       Physical contingencies, representing about 5 % of the total base cost of the project, were based&#13;
on 15% for civil works and 5% for goods and services (except for funds for local health promotion&#13;
programs, incentive payments and pharmaceuticals for which no contingencies were allocated). Price&#13;
contingencies represent about 6% of the base cost plus physical contingencies. Contingencies are&#13;
expressed in US dollars with the following annual inflation rates: 1997, 3.8%; 1998, 3.0%; 1999, 2.5%;&#13;
2000, 2.3%; 2001, 2.5%; and 2002, 2.0%.&#13;
Taxes and Customs Duties&#13;
5.5       The proposed project would be subject to taxes and duties at the rates in effect at the time&#13;
of delivery of goods and/or services provided. Medical equipment, ambulances and drugs are currently&#13;
exempt from Value Added Taxes (VAT) but subject to 5 % import taxes. Other goods financed under the&#13;
project would be subject to customs duties and taxes as follows: 24.5% on civil works and goods (office&#13;
and other equipment, vehicles and other supplies); 41 % on local salaries including health and&#13;
unemployment insurance and pension contribution; and 40.5% personal income tax on short term local&#13;
consulting services. For foreign consultants, due to the short term assignments (less than 183 days per&#13;
annum), local tax is not expected to be applicable.&#13;
5.6       The current tax liability of the project (US$15.2 million) is based on the above described&#13;
expectations. However, it is recognized that the current tax legislation may change. The CSU would&#13;
monitor changes, if any, in rates and collection procedures related to duties and taxes. All Sub-borrowers&#13;
would have full responsibility for financing all duties and taxes related to the their respective sub-projects&#13;
including any increase in project tax liabilities above the current estimated amount.&#13;

B. Project Financing&#13;
5.7        The total project cost is estimated at US$98.4 million including duties and taxes estimated&#13;
at about US$15.2 million equivalent. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$48.6 million&#13;
representing about 49% of the total project cost or 58% of the project cost net of duties and taxes. The&#13;
proposed loan of US$66.0 million would finance 93 % of the foreign exchange cost and 59 % of local cost&#13;
excluding duties and taxes. The two participating oblasts and the Federal Government would finance a&#13;
total of US$32.4 million equivalent (or about 33 % of total project costs which include the estimated duties&#13;
and taxes). Table 5.2 is the proposed financing plan for the project.&#13;

cost and 83% of expenditures for locally procured medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and reagents;&#13;
office equipment and vehicles; 100% of consulting and technical services, training (including overseas&#13;
study tours and fellowships); seminars and conferences; health promotion programs; incentive payments&#13;
to medical care providers in Kaluga Oblast; all investment and operating costs to set up and run the CSU;&#13;
and investment costs to set up oblast PMUs. Sub-borrowers would finance all duties and taxes and would&#13;
also contribute 100% of local staff salaries; office fuirniture; operating and maintenance costs for facilities,&#13;
vehicles and office equipment; and civil works with the following exceptions which would be financed&#13;
out of the proceeds of the loan:&#13;
(a) Kaluga Sub-project, Delivery System Restructuring component: construction of&#13;
11 new offices for family physicians in Kaluga City ( 7 % of all civil works under&#13;
the Project);&#13;
(b) Kaluga Sub-project, MCH component: renovation of Kaluga Municipal and&#13;
Oblast maternity homes ( 5 % of all civil works under the Project);&#13;
(c) Tver Sub-project, MCH component: construction and remodeling of Rzhev&#13;
Inter-rayon Perinatal Center (23% of all civil works under the Project).&#13;

Incremental Operating Costs&#13;
5.9       The loan would finance incremental recurrent costs for: (a) operation and maintenance of&#13;
medical equipment and ambulances acquired under the project (US$5.2 million); (b) the CSU (US$2.8&#13;
mnillion) for staff and consultant fees, office rent, minor office renovation and maintenance, minor office&#13;
equipment and supplies, office furniture, staff training and operational travel, training materials,&#13;
translation of training materials and project documents, maintenance of office equipment, communications&#13;
(including international telephone, electronic mail and facsimile transmissions), and a vehicle operation&#13;
and maintenance; and (c) Kaluga and Tver oblasts PMU (US$1.7 million each) for staff and consultant&#13;
fees, minor office equipment and supplies, furniture, staff training and business travel, training materials,&#13;
translation of training materials and project documents, and a vehicle operation and maintenance.&#13;
5.10 The respective Sub-borrowers would finance incremental operating cost for: (a) operation and&#13;
maintenance of office equipment and vehicles acquired under the project (US$13.2 million); (b) salaries&#13;
of additional personnel of medical facilities, health promotion and information centers involved in&#13;
implementation of project activities in Kaluga and Tver oblasts (US$2.5 million).&#13;
Counterpart Funds&#13;
5.11   To ensure timely budgetary provision of adequate counterpart funds, the oblast contributions&#13;
would be monitored as part of project reviews (i.e., quarterly progress reports and during Bank&#13;
supervision missions). Since successful and timely implementation of the sub-projects in the oblasts&#13;
depends, to a large extent, on the timely availability of budgetary resources to finance local contributions,&#13;
including customs duties and taxes, special arrangements would be made for the advance deposit of&#13;
counterpart funds. Kaluga and Tver Oblast authorities have agreed to transfer to the CSU Project&#13;
Account on the 25th of each month the amount required for the next following month; the amount&#13;
due would be notified by the CSU to the Oblast PMU on the 25th of the previous month. Monthly&#13;
replenishment of the CSU Project Account by both participating oblasts is a legal covenant of the&#13;
project. The first oblast to sign a subsidiary loan agreement (Oblast Agreement) is to deposit&#13;
US$15,000 equivalent into the CSU Project Account as a condition of loan effectiveness. This is to&#13;
ensure that sufficient local funds are available for the first quarter of project implementation.&#13;
Further, each oblast first quarter deposit is a condition of disbursement on all components of&#13;
respective sub-projects.&#13;
On-Lending Arrangements&#13;
5.12   The Government, through the Ministry of Finance, would on-lend Bank funds to the Kaluga and&#13;
Tver Oblast Administrations. On-lending arrangements would be reflected in Oblast Agreements between&#13;
the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health and the two oblasts. Each oblast would be responsible for&#13;
repaying 50% of the funds received at a variable rate of interest of 2.5 percent above the World Bank's&#13;
lending rate in fourteen years, including six years of grace. Repayment obligations are denominated in&#13;
US dollars. Drafts of Oblast Agreements have been reviewed at negotiations. Signing of at least one&#13;
Oblast Agreement acceptable to the Bank between a participating oblast and the Federal&#13;
Government and signing of an administrative agreement acceptable to the Bank between the RHCF&#13;
and the respective Oblast Administration are conditions of loan effectiveness. These actions will also&#13;
satisfy the conditions of sub-project disbursement. The oblast not completing these actions prior to&#13;
effectiveness would have to meet these requirements as disbursement conditions.&#13;

C. Procurement&#13;
Implementing Agencies&#13;
5.13   The Central Support Unit (CSU) would be responsible for the administration of all procurement&#13;
financed from the loan proceeds on behalf of the two oblasts, MMA and MSEI. The CSU, as a single&#13;
channel liaison with the Bank, would communicate with the Bank on procurement matters and actions&#13;
requiring Bank review. A Procurement Consulting Firm (para. 5.22) would assist the CSU in all aspects&#13;
of the procurement of civil works, goods, and services (as applicable), including assisting the CSU in&#13;
arranging for the customs clearance and distribution of the goods to the end users.&#13;
Summary of Procurement Procedures&#13;
5.14   All Civil Works, Goods and Services to be financed under the loan would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines - Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated January&#13;
1995 (revised January and August 1996) and Guidelines - Use of Consultants by the World Bank and&#13;
by the World Bank as an Executing Agency dated August 1981. Standard Bidding Documents for Works,&#13;
Goods, and Form of Contracts (Services) issued by the Bank would be used as appropriate. The Bank'&#13;
Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works, National Competitive Bidding (Small Works), dated&#13;
September, 1995 would be used for all NCB packages, and for Pharmaceuticals procured utilizing ICB&#13;
procedures the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines,&#13;
dated September, 1993 would be used. Civil works, goods and services would be grouped to the extent&#13;
possible to encourage-competitive bidding. All arrangements related to procurement of services (TA and&#13;
training) would be administered by the CSU with assistance and input from oblasts PMUs. Procurement&#13;
procedures are outlined in Table 5.3 and described below.  Initial packaging is reflected in the&#13;
procurement plan in Annex 3.6 and would be further refined after the Procurement Consulting Firm is&#13;
mobilized.&#13;
5.15   Procurement of civil works, goods and services not financed from the loan proceeds (i.e. Not&#13;
Bank Financed - NBF), estimated at US$7.9 million equivalent, would be carried out in accordance with&#13;
project beneficiaries' respective procedures.&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
5.16   Civil works with financing from the proceeds of the loan (US$4.8 million, including US$3.8&#13;
million loan financing) would be procured as follows:&#13;
(a) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be used for the construction, remodeling&#13;
and equipping the Rzhev Inter-rayon Perinatal Center (Tver Sub-project, MCH&#13;
Component). It was agreed that a combined contract for civil works and supply of&#13;
appropriate goods would be used to avoid coordination problems and delays. This one&#13;
contract would represent about 63% of total civil works (US$2.3 million) and 5%&#13;
(US$2.2 million) of total goods financed from the loan.&#13;
(b) National Competitive Bidding (NCB) would be used for the procurement of civil works&#13;
under US$1.0 million equivalent. Included would be two bid packages of two contracts&#13;
each as follows: 2 contracts for construction of 11 family physician offices (Kaluga Sub-&#13;
project, Delivery System Restructuring component) with an estimated cost of US$0.4&#13;
million equivalent per contract; and 2 contracts for renovation of oblast and municipal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 42                                Project Costs, Financing,Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
maternity homes (Kaluga Sub-project, MCH component), with an estimated cost of&#13;
US$0.3 million equivalent per contract. These four bid packages at an estimated cost of&#13;
US$1.7 million would represent about 37% of the civil works financed from the loan.&#13;
International contractors are unlikely to be interested in such small contracts, but if&#13;
interested could participate.&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
5.17   Goods (US$43.3 million) consisting of medical equipment and supplies; pharmaceuticals;&#13;
computer, office equipment and software for medical facilities and health promotion centers; ambulances&#13;
and other medical vehicles; training materials, etc. would be procured as described below. All lists of&#13;
goods and proposed grouping for procurement purposes would be subject to review by the Bank. A&#13;
preliminary schedule and packaging of goods is given in Annex 3.6&#13;
(a) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be used for packages&#13;
above US$300,000 equivalent for an estimated total cost of US$36.2 million&#13;
(90% of total goods). Thirteen bid packages are planned under ICB, including&#13;
four for pharmaceuticals and two for ambulances and other vehicles.&#13;
b) Limited International Bidding (LIB) procedures would be permitted for purchases&#13;
estimated to cost an aggregate of US$2.1 million (5 % of total goods). LIB would&#13;
be used for specialized purchases such as endoscopic and ultrasonic medical&#13;
equipment where few qualified suppliers are available. About four bid packages&#13;
are anticipated using LIB procedures with an average value of US$0.5 million.&#13;
(c) International Shopping (IS) procedures may be used for contracts up to&#13;
US$300,000 for an estimated aggregate total cost of US$0.8 million (2% of total&#13;
goods). IS would be used for the procurement of medical training equipment (2&#13;
contracts totalling US$60,000); a specialized software compatible with locally&#13;
available equipment for Provider Payment Components in Kaluga and Tver sub-&#13;
projects; office and computer equipment and 5 office vehicles for the CSU, and&#13;
oblast PMUs (4 contracts totalling US$290,000, including US$60,000 for&#13;
vehicles for PMUs); and radio dispatch equipment for an Emergency Ambulance&#13;
Center in Tver and oblast maternity home in Kaluga (one bid package,&#13;
US$280,000).&#13;
(d) National Shopping (NS) procedures may be used for contracts up to US$50,000&#13;
equivalent for an aggregate total of US$1.3 million (3% of total goods) for the&#13;
procurement of locally available, off-the-shelf items of small value. Items to be&#13;
procured would consist of office equipment; training materials; supplies; spare&#13;
parts and other maintenance items. In case of training materials a refined estimate&#13;
of each contract would be determined at the time of Bank's review of semi-&#13;
annual action plans for training with detailed budgets.&#13;

a/  Includes Limited International Bidding (US$2.2 million) for endoscopic and ultrasonic equipment.&#13;
b/  It is estimated that a total of US$1.0 million for preparation, publishing, copying and dissemination of training materials&#13;
would be procured under NS procedures. A refined estimate of each contract would be determined by the Bank on an&#13;
annual basis at the time of Bank's review of project components's annual action plans with detailed budgets.&#13;
c/  Includes International Shopping for US$0.22 million for procurement of a specially designed software compatible with&#13;
locally available equipment (Kaluga and Tver Provider Payments components), and US$0.28 million for a procurement&#13;
of a radio dispatch equipment for Tver Ambulance Center.&#13;

Academy to continue activities related to establishment of a training center for family medicine in Kaluga.&#13;
e/  Includes US$1.2 million (approximately 35 contracts) for study tours and 2 fellowships (US$0.1 million). In-country&#13;
training (totally US$4.0 million) would be arranged by the CSU and oblast PMUs, reimbursement by SOE;&#13;
f/   A refined estimate, nature of each contract and procurement method would be determined at the time of Bank's review&#13;
of annual plans and detailed budget for Health Promotion Programs.&#13;

(d) Direct Contracting (DC) procedures may be used for the procurement of goods,&#13;
where required goods are proprietary and obtainable from only one source and&#13;
after review by the Bank. Goods, yet to be identified, consisting of certain&#13;
medical supplies, reagents, consumables, spare parts and training materials (up&#13;
to an aggregate of US$3.0 million, 7% of total goods) are expected to be&#13;
included under this procedure.&#13;
(e) Procurementfrom  UN Agencies. Should it be determined that procurement of&#13;
medical equipment, and supplies and pharmaceuticals could be carried out in a&#13;
more efficient and effective way from UNICEF or other UN Agencies, then such&#13;
procedure could be used, subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
5.18        Procurement of goods, financed from  the proceeds of the loan to be provided to the NBF&#13;
facilities (civil works), would be coordinated with the scheduled completion of those facilities. The CSU,&#13;
assisted by the Procurement Consulting Firm and oblast PMUs would be responsible for maintaining an&#13;
up-to-date schedule for completion of required work for each NBF facility and, based upon this&#13;
information, would closely monitor and adjust the schedule of equipment procurement and final delivery&#13;
to the facilities.&#13;
5.19        Special attention would be required to the procurement of pharmaceuticals included in the&#13;
project since they would be procured once every two years with financing from the loan (US$5.5&#13;
million). The list of eligible drugs, to be reviewed by the Bank, would specify only generic names of the&#13;
drugs required, and all drugs would require registration in the Russian Federation. Also, the drugs&#13;
financed under the proposed project would have to be registered in their own country of manufacture and&#13;
authorization certificates from all original manufactures would be required. Drugs would be in standard&#13;
formulation in agreed packages and no non-standard pack and mini powder bulk materials will be&#13;
permitted.&#13;

Preference for Domestic Manufactured Goods&#13;
5.20      For contracts for goods to be awarded on the basis of ICB, the Borrower may, as set forth&#13;
in the Loan Agreement, grant a margin preference of 15% or the amount of applicable customs duties,&#13;
whichever is lower, to qualified domestic manufactures of goods in accordance with the World Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines (January 1995 - revised January 1996). Where appropriate, the technical&#13;
specifications of the equipment and the procurement packages would be designed so as not to preclude&#13;
domestic manufacturers from competing. It is anticipated that Russian suppliers and/or manufactures&#13;
would be competitive for the supply of goods.&#13;
Procurement of Consulting, Technical and Contractual Services&#13;
5.21      The proposed project includes about 125 person-years for consulting services (US$7.1&#13;
million) for Consulting and Technical Services and about US$6.9 million for Contractual Services related&#13;
to the medical equipment maintenance. All consultants would be hired on terms and conditions (including&#13;
review of their qualifications) in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Details of proposed consulting services and drafts of TORs would be included in the Project Operational&#13;
Manual which is being prepared by the project beneficiaries.&#13;
5.22      Procurement Services. A Procurement Consulting Firm would be hired based on competitive&#13;
bids from short listed finns. The selected firm would be represented by a full time manager for the&#13;
project who would report to the CSU Director and would assist in the administration of the procurement&#13;
of the works, goods (and services where applicable). Responsibilities of the Procurement Consulting Firm&#13;
would include, inter alia, establishment of a computerized management and monitoring reporting system;&#13;
finalization of preparation of all bidding documents for works and goods financed under the loan and&#13;
including assistance in arranging for customs clearance and in-country transportation to the end-users.&#13;
This firm would maintain the management and information system and would record all procurement&#13;
(works, goods and related services) included in the project, including the consolidation of quarterly&#13;
progress reports.&#13;
5.23      Architectural and Engineering (AIE) Services. For civil works in Kaluga and Tver Oblasts,&#13;
the Procurement Consulting Firm, as part of its services, would provide the necessary specialists for the&#13;
preparation of bidding documents for civil works (financed from the loan). An Engineer/Advisor would&#13;
be contracted by the CSU to assist oblasts in civil works supervision to the completion of the works.&#13;
Kaluga and Tver oblast PMUs would be staffed with a civil engineer to ensure a close monitoring and&#13;
quality control over the construction works. In the case of the Rzhev Perinatal Inter-rayon Center, the&#13;
design is being done by the local Architectural/Engineering Institute under the Tver oblast financing.&#13;
During contract execution the same firm could provide supervision/advisory assistance to the PMU&#13;
financed under the loan on a sole source basis, assuming satisfactory performance during the&#13;
preparation/design phase, and if the oblast chooses to do so.&#13;
5.24      Academic and Institutional Partnership. Consultants for the academic partnership under the&#13;
Family Medicine component of Tver oblast Sub-project and National Family Medicine Component would&#13;
be limited to established Medical Teaching Institutions with academic programs similar to those to be&#13;
established under the proposed project. Moscow Medical Academy (MMA) which has been establishing&#13;
an institutional partnership with Kaluga oblast to set up a training center for family medicine would be&#13;
contracted on a sole source basis ($100,000). Consultants for the institutional partnership under the&#13;
Monitoring, Evaluation and Dissemination Component would be limited to academic, research or similar&#13;
institutions with in-house experience in monitoring and evaluation of health projects or health reforms.&#13;

Training&#13;
5.25      For locally conducted and overseas training, and study tours (US$4.6 million) financed from&#13;
the proceeds of the loan, the qualifications of candidates along with their course of study, proposed&#13;
training institutions and costs would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Candidates would be&#13;
selected on the basis of established criteria, to be prepared by the project beneficiaries with assistance&#13;
from the CSU, and to be agreed upon with the Bank.The CSU would administer all overseas training and&#13;
study tours and assist project beneficiaries in arranging in-country training. Local (within oblast) training&#13;
would be administered by the respective PMUs. Annex 4.1 describes training to be financed under the&#13;
project.&#13;
Incentive Payments to Medical Providers&#13;
5.26      Under the Provider Incentives component, Kaluga Sub-project, an "incentive payment pool"&#13;
of US$1.4 million equivalent would be established for primary care physicians and nurses. Kaluga Oblast&#13;
would develop detailed plans for the new payment system, including regulations on the implementation&#13;
and management of the incentive pool, which would be subject to Bank review (para 3.24).&#13;
Health Promotion Programs&#13;
5.27      The Health Promotion Programs (US$3.3 million equivalent) would be financed from the&#13;
proceeds of the loan, using National Shopping procedures up to a limit of US$3.3 million. The funds&#13;
would be reserved for antenatal care and family planning sub-components under MCH components in&#13;
both Tver and Kaluga Oblasts (US$ 2.3 million), and for health promotion campaigns directed towards&#13;
prevention of CVD under the Cardiovascular Health Services Component in Tver Oblast (US$1.0&#13;
million). The funds would be used to cover costs (including TA) of development, production and&#13;
dissemination of health promotion materials and purchase of TV/radio broadcasting time. Should&#13;
equipment items under the health promotion campaigns be required, such as video cameras, projectors,&#13;
LCD panels, etc., the list would be submitted to the Bank at the time of annual action plans and budget&#13;
reviews, including proposed procurement procedures, a refined estimate and nature of each contract.&#13;
Notification of Business Opportunities&#13;
5.28      A General Procurement Notice (GPN) is scheduled to be published in the April 30, 1997&#13;
edition of the UN publication "Development Business" and, as appropriate, would be updated and&#13;
published annually thereafter. For goods and civil works to be obtained by ICB, individual bidding&#13;
opportunities would be advertised in a major local newspapers 30 days prior to availability of bidding&#13;
opportunities and transmitted to potential bidders who expressed interest in bidding in response to the&#13;
published General Procurement Notice. These advertisements would be in the English language.&#13;
Assistance to Contractors and Suppliers&#13;
5.29      The CSU would organize and conduct workshops as necessary for all interested contractors&#13;
and suppliers that have purchased bidding documents on the methodology of completing bidding&#13;
documents.&#13;

Project Preparation Facility (PPF)&#13;
5.30      A PPF in the amount of US$729,000 (No.P295-0-RU of July 11, 1996) has been provided&#13;
to the Government to advance project preparation consisting of: (a) setting up of the CSU and the Oblast&#13;
PMUs; (b) consulting services and training; and (c) initial payment for a Procurement Consulting Firm&#13;
to assist in the preparation of bidding documents for civil works to be financed from the proceeds of the&#13;
loan during the first year of the project.&#13;
Review By The Bank of Procurement Decisions&#13;
5.31      Scheduling of Procurement. Prior to the issuance of any invitation for bidding, the proposed&#13;
procurement plan (Annex 3.6) for the project would be reviewed by the CSU and PMUs, and the Bank&#13;
would be advised of any proposed modifications for its review in accordance with the provision of&#13;
paragraph 1 of Annex 1 of the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Procurement of all works, goods and&#13;
services would be undertaken in accordance with the agreed procurement plan which would be adjusted&#13;
as appropriate and included as a part of the quarterly progress reports and would be subject to Bank&#13;
review.&#13;
5.32      Prior Review: (a) Civil Works and Goods. Prior review of bidding documents, including&#13;
review of evaluations and recommendations for award of contracts, would be carried out for all&#13;
procurement utilizing ICB, LIB and NCB procedures; and for all documents and recommendations&#13;
involving direct contracting. Accordingly, 100% (US$3.8 million) of procurement of civil works and&#13;
about 96% (US$35.8 million) of procurement of goods transactions would be subject to prior review by&#13;
the Bank. The list of goods and drugs to be procured would also be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
(b) Consulting and Contractual Services. Terms of reference of all consulting assignments would be&#13;
subject to prior Bank review. Terms and conditions of contracts, invitation packages and evaluation&#13;
reports of assignments costing more than US$50,000 each for individual consultants, and US$100,000&#13;
each for firms would be subject to prior review by the Bank. All documents and recommendations&#13;
involving sole source contracting would also be subject to prior review as well. Accordingly, about 96%&#13;
(US$19.7 million) of these transactions would be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
5.33      After award of contract, should any material modifications or waiver of terms and conditions&#13;
of a contract result in an increase above 15% of the original price, the Bank would reserve the right to&#13;
the prior review of such modifications (including the modifications in contracts for Consulting Services).&#13;
5.34      Post review. In respect of each contract not covered by the above, review would be carried&#13;
out in accordance with para 4 of Appendix 1 of the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement and would also&#13;
be reviewed during the Bank's supervision missions.&#13;
Procurement Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
5.35      Procurement information would be collected and recorded as follows: (a) the Procurement&#13;
Consulting Firm would be responsible under the direction of the CSU for preparing a master procurement&#13;
plan (updated quarterly), and establishing and maintaining a computerized monitoring and reporting&#13;
system that would provide an up-to-date inventory of goods and works procured under ICB, LIB and&#13;
NCB, consolidated and delivered to the end-users; (b) the CSU would prepare comprehensive quarterly&#13;
reports to the Bank on behalf of and with inputs from the Sub-borrowers indicating, inter alia: (i) revised&#13;
cost estimates for individual contracts; (ii) revised timing of procurement actions, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 48                                Project Costs, Financing,Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
advertisements, bids dates, contract awards, and completion dates for individual contracts; and (iii)&#13;
compliance with aggregate limits on specific methods of procurement.&#13;
5.36      All project Sub-borrowers would prepare semi-annual schedules for training programs with&#13;
appropriate details. The CSU would consolidate the reports and submit them to the Bank to facilitate the&#13;
review process.&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)&#13;
5.37      A draft of CPAR for the Russian Federation was prepared in December, 1996 and is currently&#13;
being discussed with the Government. For this proposed project, the Borrower would follow agreed Bank&#13;
procurement procedures (in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines) as described above and as set forth&#13;
in the Loan Agreement.&#13;
D. Disbursement&#13;
5.38     The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of six years which includes six months&#13;
for finalization of accounts and submission of withdrawal applications. As there is no standard&#13;
disbursement profile for the Russian Federation, the disbursement forecast is based on the Bank's&#13;
experience in financing similar health projects in other countries and is based on a detailed work program&#13;
which Bank staff consider realistic. The Project Completion Date would be October 31, 2003 with a&#13;
Loan Closing Date of April 30, 2004. The estimated disbursement schedule and chart are given in&#13;
Annex 3.8.&#13;
Disbursement Percentages&#13;
5.39      The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed in accordance with procedures described in the&#13;
Bank's "Disbursement Handbook". The Disbursement Categories and Percentage of Expenditures to be&#13;
Financed and the Estimated Schedule of IBRD Loan Disbursements are shown in Tables 5.4 and 5.5&#13;
below.&#13;
5.40      Disbursement of funds for health promotion programs would be carried out based on a&#13;
detailed plan and budget for annual activities prepared by the health promotion centers in each&#13;
participating oblast and approved by the Head of the Oblast Project Coordination Committee and the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
5.41      Disbursements for all the contracts would be made against full documentation with the&#13;
following exceptions where certified statement of expenditures (SOE's) would be used:&#13;
*  expenditures under contracts for goods valued at or less than US$100,000;&#13;
*  expenditures under contracts for individual consultants valued at or less than&#13;
US$50,000;&#13;
*  expenditures under contracts for consulting firms valued at or less than&#13;
US$100,000;&#13;
*  in-country training and study tours valued at or less than US$10,000 per trip per&#13;
person;&#13;
*  operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Cost, Financing, Procurement and Disbursement                            Page 49&#13;
5.42      Disbursement/procurement documents using SOE procedures would be retained by the CSU&#13;
for a period of at least two years after disbursement and made available to Bank staff and external&#13;
auditors. Oblasts PMUs may keep a set of copies for their respective sub-projects for easier reference.&#13;
The CSU would be handling all financial issues on behalf of and based on authorization from the Moscow&#13;
Medical Academy and MSEI, and would retain a full set of supporting documentation for their&#13;
respective sub-projects.&#13;
Special Account&#13;
5.43      To facilitate payments of small and medium size amounts in foreign currency and all&#13;
payments in local currency, a Special Account (SA) in US dollars would be opened in a commercial bank,&#13;
selected by the Government on the basis of competitive shopping, acceptable to the Bank. The selection&#13;
process and criteria would follow the Bank's standardized procedure (i.e. competitive shopping). The&#13;
SA would be in the name of the Borrower and would be administered by the CSU of the RHIF which&#13;
would be designated to be a coordinating agency to gather documents, reconcile the SA and submit&#13;
applications for replenishment to the Bank. During the early stage of the project implementation, the&#13;
initial allocation of the Special Account would be limited to US$1.0 million. However, when the&#13;
aggregate disbursement under the Loan have reached the level of US$5.0 million, the initial allocation&#13;
may be increased up to the authorized allocation of US$1.5 million by submitting the relevant Application&#13;
for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months, and must&#13;
include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents. The CSU would&#13;
establish an appropriate accounting system to provide information on the project on the proper receipt&#13;
and use of funds in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The CSU would be responsible for providing&#13;
assistance to the PMU's accountants in maintaining sub-project accounts for counterpart funds and&#13;
appropriate financial documentation.&#13;
5.44      Though signing authority for all contracts would rest with respective Sub-borrowers, the&#13;
CSU, upon request and based on written authorization of Sub-Borrowers, may sign contracts on their&#13;
behalf. In all cases the CSU would make appropriate payments for the goods and services procured out&#13;
of the loan funds and/or authorize the Bank to pay some contractors directly and would manage all&#13;
disbursements under the proposed project. The minimum application size for payments directly from the&#13;
loan account or for issuance of Special Commitments is 20% of the special account authorized allocation.&#13;
Minimum application size until aggregate disbursements reach US$5.0 million would be US$200,000;&#13;
thereafter, it will be US$300,000. In case of small payments in local currency (i.e. travel advances for&#13;
in-country training, monthly operating costs) a respective Sub-Borrower would either make payments&#13;
in full out of its own funds and would send a request for reimbursement with a full set of supporting&#13;
documents to the CSU or the CSU would transfer an advance in local currency to the PMU account&#13;
against provided cost estimates. The CSU would check the claimed expenditures for the compliance with&#13;
the project's tasks and would process a reimbursement from the SA or arrange an advance payment from&#13;
the CSU Project Account (in local currency) to the PMU account.&#13;
E. Reporting&#13;
Quarterly Progress Reporting&#13;
5.45      Quarterly progress reports covering all project components would be prepared by the PMUs&#13;
and consolidated by the CSU, which would send them to the Bank within one month of the end of each&#13;
quarter. The format of the reports would be mutually agreed upon prior to the date of the first submission&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 50                                          Project Costs, Financing,Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
and would be modified as necessary during implementation of the project. The purpose of the reports&#13;
would be to provide the Bank and the Sub-Borrowers with timely information on implementation of all&#13;
project components and lessons learned. The CSU would set up reporting guidelines and deadlines for&#13;
the receipt of information from all project PMUs in order to prepare a consolidated report. The first&#13;
report would be issued before the first Bank supervision mission. The reports would include, inter-alia:&#13;
(a) progress achieved against agreed implementation and disbursement schedules and key performance&#13;
indicators, including number of contracts awarded and status of all contracts; (b) work programs and cost&#13;
estimates for the coming quarter; (c) status of compliance with covenants and major agreements under&#13;
the project; (d) update on monitoring and evaluation indicators; (e) a description of issues and problem&#13;
areas along with recommended corrective actions; (f) a description of progress in resolving previous&#13;
problems and addressing earlier recommendations; and (g) status of the Special Account.&#13;
5.46        The CSU would be responsible for translation of all reports into English for submission to&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
5.47        The CSU would establish an accounting and control system which would have the capability&#13;
to record and retrieve all financial transactions associated with the project in a timely manner and comply&#13;
with internationally accepted accounting standards. The CSU would maintain consolidated accounts for&#13;
the project and would ensure appropriate accounting of the funds provided under the loan separate for&#13;
each Sub-Borrower. Each PMU would be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the funds provided&#13;
by the respective Sub-Borrower. The CSU would prepare quarterly financial reports, and ensure that&#13;
audits of the financial statements or reports are submitted to the Bank on time. The accounts would be&#13;
maintained for all loan funds. The CSU would be responsible for providing assistance to the PMU's&#13;
accountants in maintaining sub-project accounts and appropriate financial documentation.&#13;

including a separate opinion, by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, for SOEs against&#13;
which disbursements have been made or are due to be made from the loan and SOEs which would&#13;
be included in the audit reports accompanying the financial statements. The audited financial&#13;
statements for the Special Account, project accounts, and SOEs of the preceding fiscal year,&#13;
including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made against certified statements of&#13;
expenditures, would be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the Government's fiscal&#13;
year. Timely submission of audit reports would be a covenant of the project. Funds to carry out the&#13;
audits have been included in the project.&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR)&#13;
5.49      The CSU would prepare in conjunction with the Bank, an ICR upon completion of the Project&#13;
and in any event not later than six months after final disbursement of the loan proceeds. Included in the&#13;
ICR would be an assessment on the execution and initial operation of the project, costs and benefits&#13;
derived or to be derived, the performance of the Borrower, the Bank and other agencies involved in the&#13;
project regarding their respective obligations and accomplishments, and including lessons learned. The&#13;
ICR would also include plans for the future operation of the facilities which had been financed under the&#13;
project, including the indicators for monitoring and evaluating future operations.&#13;

VI. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Justification&#13;
Project Concept&#13;
6.1       This project is built on the premise that health outcomes and client satisfaction can improve&#13;
significantly in Russia, even with health expenditures remaining within current and expected resource&#13;
constraints. These improvements could be attained through selective investments to renew the stock of&#13;
physical and human capital in the system and through major restructuring of the health system in all its&#13;
aspects - clinical, financial, organizational and managerial - in such a way as to use the available&#13;
resources more efficiently. Experience has shown that a health system that favors prevention over cure,&#13;
general (or primary) care over specialized care, and outpatient over inpatient care, performs more&#13;
efficiently in the long run. This fundamental principle drives the investment choices that have been made&#13;
in the project and shapes the reform that is being undertaken.&#13;
Choice of Project Components&#13;
6.2       The project concentrates on three generic types of components: (i) changing provider&#13;
incentives; (ii) restructuring the health care system in favor of outpatient care and Family Medicine; and&#13;
(iii) improving clinical practices. The underlying strategic choice was to focus on systemic interventions&#13;
that could trigger changes whose benefits would extend beyond the immediate reach of project&#13;
investments and beyond the project lifetime.&#13;
6.3       Changing Provider Incentives. The new provider payment systems to be introduced under&#13;
the project would aim to promote primary care, eliminate unnecessary referrals to specialists, reduce&#13;
hospital admissions, and reduce lengths of stay in hospitals. This would be accomplished by changing&#13;
current input-based payment methods to performance- or output-based methods. A fundholding system&#13;
with the primary provider as fundholder - either for outpatient services only or for all services including&#13;
hospital care - would encourage family physicians to offer as broad a range of services as possible and&#13;
cut down unnecessary referrals to diagnostic facilities or to hospitals. Case-based hospital payment&#13;
systems would reduce average length of stay and encourage overall efficiency.&#13;
6.4       Experiments in the late 1980s in Kemerovo Oblast and St. Petersburg showed that&#13;
fundholding combined with case-based hospital payments successfully reduced hospital admissions and&#13;
average length of stay, and allowed a reduction in the number of hospital beds. In Kemerovo, hospital&#13;
admissions were ten percent lower in 1989 than in 1987. Bed capacity declined by 1,500 beds, with a&#13;
substantial shift in structure of hospital units. In St. Petersburg, hospital admissions fell by five percent&#13;
during the same period. About 2,500 beds became unnecessary, and some hospitals were restructured&#13;
into nursing homes. The average length of stay fell from 19 to 17 days. Bed allocations by unit also&#13;
changed. In the Kemerovo and St. Petersburg experiments, fundholding was done by the polyclinic&#13;
(which included primary care providers and outpatient specialists), rather than the primary care provider.&#13;
The present project would experiment with bringing fundholding one level further down in the system,&#13;
hopefully encouraging further reductions in referrals. Case-based hospital payment schedules would also&#13;
be refined to further encourage cost-effective case management.&#13;
6.5       An alternative payment mechanism for hospitals - global budgeting adjusted for case-mix,&#13;
severity and volume of services - will also be tested under the project. This would combine the&#13;
advantages of a global budgeting system that puts a direct cap on overall hospital costs with a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Justification and Risks                                                                  Page 53&#13;
performance-based system which encourages cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Applied in tandem with&#13;
a fundholding system for outpatient care, this would prevent the potential loss of cost control often&#13;
identified with a shift to performance-based payment systems.&#13;
6.6       Investments in institutional structures to strengthen quality assurance would help ensure that&#13;
the quality of care is protected under the pressures of cost-cutting. New management information systems&#13;
would support these QA systems as well as financial and other management requirements of payment&#13;
reform and a restructured delivery system.&#13;
6.7        Restructuring the Delivery System. Quality of care in Russia cannot improve substantially&#13;
unless physical and human capital are restored after years of neglect. Project investments in equipment,&#13;
training and civil works would improve the effectiveness of care and, therefore, both outcomes and&#13;
consumer satisfaction. Given limitations on available resources in the system, selectivity in the choice&#13;
of investments is an essential feature of the project. Because these investments are concentrated on&#13;
primary and secondary levels of care, they address a wider range of health needs and reach a larger share&#13;
of the population than past investments which tended to favor specialist and inpatient services. The focus&#13;
on Family Medicine is especially crucial to building a credible primary care system that could keep a&#13;
larger number of clients at the lowest-cost end of the system, while still satisfying quality requirements.&#13;
The concept of the Consultation, Diagnosis and Treatment Center (CDTC) as support to the primary&#13;
provider would reinforce the latter's role.  In addition, better-equipped (though not excessively&#13;
sophisticated) CDTCs would keep patients out of hospitals as long as possible. Training of staff and&#13;
managers of the concerned facilities will include not just new techniques related to new equipment, but&#13;
also the new relations that need to exist among facilities and caregivers, and the corresponding flow of&#13;
patients and flow of funds that should differ significantly from the current situation. Training for primary&#13;
providers, combined with the new incentive system, will encourage a greater reliance on preventive&#13;
measures.&#13;
6.8       Improving Clinical Practice. Clinical practices that are out-of-date and/or not cost-conscious&#13;
are a critical systemic problem in Russia, cutting across all fields of medicine. Besides the direct benefit&#13;
to the quality and effectiveness of specific services, the collective exercise of improving clinical practices&#13;
in all fields is an essential step in designing restructured incentive systems, delivery networks, and many&#13;
other components of health reform. The tasks of updating standards of clinical practice and undertaking&#13;
the necessary investments in human and physical capital to retool the system accordingly are immense.&#13;
They can only be accomplished over years or even decades. Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and&#13;
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) have been selected as illustrative cases for this exercise and it is hoped&#13;
that the approach applied under the project to these two selected fields will stimulate similar initiatives&#13;
in other fields of clinical practice. In this respect, project investments are justified not just for their direct&#13;
effects on maternal, infant, or cardiovascular health, but also for their value in demonstrating approaches&#13;
to changing clinical practice.&#13;
6.9        The choice of MCH and CVD was the result of informed judgement that took into account&#13;
a variety of factors: the overall burden of disease; the scope for improving current clinical approaches;&#13;
the potential costs of these improvements per Disability-Adjusted Life-Year (DALY) saved; the potential&#13;
for packaging groups of relatively cost-effective interventions in a shared delivery mechanisms (as with&#13;
reproductive health services for women); and the opportunity to establish patterns of change that could&#13;
transfer to other areas of care (especially the shift of emphasis to preventive measures, the stress on basic&#13;
emergency services, and the limited use of high-tech equipment or interventions).&#13;

6.10        Statistics on causes of mortality in Russia place cardiovascular disease as the primary cause&#13;
of death in Russia and perinatal mortality at ninth position.   Adjusting for years-of-potential-life-lost&#13;

mortality to fourth position (after neoplasms).t'&#13;

Although maternal mortality is not among the top ten on the list, women's reproductive health has a direct&#13;
(though unmeasured) impact on infant health. In addition, because the available studies rely on mortality&#13;
statistics, they do not take account of the effects on women's mental and physical health of the excessive&#13;
reliance on abortion as a means of family planning nor of their effect on infertility, a major health issue&#13;
in Russia. Hence infant mortality and cardiovascular disease are major elements of the burden of disease&#13;
in Russia, with maternal morbidity probably playing an important role.&#13;

6.11      To complete the cost-effectiveness analysis needed to assess priorities for investment,&#13;
information on the costs of specific interventions per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) saved would&#13;
be needed. Such information is not currently available for Russia. Even if actual cost data were&#13;
available, valid cost-effectiveness comparisons cannot be done using cost information derived from&#13;
delivery systems that are patently inefficient. However, both MCH and CVD represent areas of care in&#13;
Russia where known lower-cost approaches to care (e.g., prevention, contraception, ante-natal services,&#13;
basic emergency services) are often bypassed for expensive, sophisticated approaches on the one hand&#13;
or approaches that are simply out-of-date on the other hand. Hence the new clinical practices could&#13;
reasonably be expected to result in better quality care at lower cost than current practices are providing.&#13;
It should be noted that interventions selected for the CVD component - in particular the support for&#13;
preventive interventions as well as the restructuring of the emergency system - are multi-purpose&#13;
interventions that affect other priorities in the disease burden, notably traumas and poisoning which is&#13;
at the top of the list.&#13;
Rationale for Public Sector Involvement&#13;
6.12      Imperfections and failures in the health care market (externalities, uncertainty, asymmetry of&#13;
information, market power) as well as societal equity considerations are arguments used to justify public&#13;
sector involvement in health care. The form of involvement by the public sector differs among countries&#13;
- with varying degrees of involvement in financing, provision and regulation - and there is not always&#13;
clear evidence for preferring one form over another. In most cases, the historical context out of which&#13;
the contemporary system evolved plays a dominant role in determining reform priorities and possibilities.&#13;
But there is growing convergence towards certain models that have proven more robust than others.&#13;
6.13      Public financing of health care is primarily motivated by equity considerations. Russia has&#13;
made the choice to continue funding health through government budgets and an earmarked payroll tax,&#13;
and through these sources, to guarantee universal access to a certain standard of care. The significance&#13;
of this social/political choice cannot be underestimated. Although the Soviet system was noted for its&#13;
wide geographic access, rationing did take place particularly at the higher end of the system where&#13;
"informal" cash payments tended to be larger and where one's place on the queue was determined by&#13;
one's connections. A public guarantee of universal access under a new economic regime that tends to&#13;
widen economic inequality would represent a major pillar in any new system of social protection. In&#13;
making the choice for public financing the public sector also takes on responsibility for ensuring that these&#13;
funds are used cost-effectively and that the costs of guaranteed entitlements are sustainable within fiscal&#13;
limits and within limits set on the payroll tax burden. Provider-payment mechanisms, if appropriately&#13;
designed, are potent tools to accomplish both the equity and efficiency objectives of public financing.&#13;
In Russia, provider payment is particularly important because of the lack of financial and other incentives&#13;
for efficiency and accountability under the old Soviet system.&#13;
6.14      Many personal health services can be provided efficiently by the private sector once an&#13;
appropriate incentive structure and regulatory framework are in place. The Russian Government has&#13;
taken the first steps in the long road to privatization by separating the functions of financing and provision&#13;
within the health care system, introducing elements of competition into the market (e.g., choice of&#13;
provider and insurance company) and decentralizing certain budget decisions to the level of the facility.&#13;
In order for providers to function as fully independent economic units, further reforms are required to&#13;
stabilize the new financing sources, clarify provider payment rules, develop accountability and managerial&#13;
skills among providers, and create the appropriate regulatory framework for both the health insurance&#13;
industry and providers. Reforms supported by the project would further these goals. Beyond these&#13;
changes, and outside the scope of the present project, mechanisms for transferring ownership of facilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 56                                                                Justification and Risks&#13;
from the public to the private sector (or transferring responsibility for asset management and financing&#13;
to the semi-public sector, as in the case of the self-governing Hospital Trusts in the UK) will eventually&#13;
need to be developed.&#13;
6.15      Finally, although provision of public health services are often considered the domain of the&#13;
public sector, this project introduces an approach to the funding of health promotion activities - through&#13;
the establishment of health promotion funds for MCH and CVD - that opens the possibility for sub-&#13;
contracting such activities to the private sector.&#13;
Focus on the Oblast&#13;
6.16      The choice of the oblast as the focus of the project was both strategic and opportunistic. The&#13;
initial focus of project preparation was a set of nine priority programs organized under the initiative of&#13;
the MOH, with each effectively approached as a vertical program under separate leadership within the&#13;
federal structure. However, within a few months of preparation, it became evident that decentralization&#13;
of financing and management of care to the oblasts had shifted the locus of reform from the federal to&#13;
the local level. In addition, while federal institutions like the MOH struggled to redefine their new roles&#13;
(especially with the MOH having lost responsibility for service delivery but gained new responsibility for&#13;
medical industries), oblast authorities had no choice but to continue services under highly unstable&#13;
circumstances and were hence more receptive to reform.&#13;
6.17      The choice to work with the oblasts having been made, a number of high-priority issues are&#13;
wholly or largely excluded from this project because they require significant intervention at the federal&#13;
level. Among them are: regulation of the health insurance industry; development of federal level&#13;
institutions; financing, distribution and use of pharmaceuticals; and multi-sectoral public health programs.&#13;
They would, however, be high priority choices for future Bank funding.&#13;
Choice of Pilot Approach&#13;
6.18      Almost every intervention in the project involves a change in the way of doing business in&#13;
the health sector. Although studiously drawn from successful experience in other countries, and carefully&#13;
adapted to local conditions, there is little real-world experience to judge how they would turn out when&#13;
actually applied in Russia. In addition to uncertainties about implementation feasibility and expected&#13;
effectiveness, there is little real-world (i.e., in Russia) basis for predicting the costs or sustainability of&#13;
the interventions proposed. Best efforts have been made to estimate recurrent costs of the new outpatient-&#13;
based system to be introduced in Kaluga, using common international standards (para 6.24), and&#13;
assumptions are made about how providers will change behavior in response to new incentives.&#13;
However, these assumptions need to be verified by actual experience.  Hence the choice of the pilot&#13;
approach.&#13;
6.19      The project also tests an approach to health reform that is centered on local-level authorities.&#13;
The experience of two oblasts managing broad-ranging reform, and the types of support required to help&#13;
them accomplish their objectives, should provide valuable lessons that could be replicated in other parts&#13;
of the country. The two national-level components in the project - the National Family Medicine&#13;
Program and the Monitoring, Evaluation and Dissemination Component - demonstrate ways in which&#13;
assistance from federal level institutions can help enhance the oblasts' chances of success, and hopefully&#13;
would lead to a better definition of roles for federal-level institutions in the decentralized system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Justification and Risks                                                                  Page 57&#13;
6.20       The Monitoring, Evaluation and Dissemination (MED) Component of the project is an&#13;
essential element of the pilot approach. Lessons learned from this pilot could form the basis for future&#13;
projects. If the pilot experience is successful and concrete criteria can be defined for future selection of&#13;
projects, subsequent projects could be financed through a funding facility that would be more flexible and&#13;
easier to implement than the present project. It is hoped that preparation and supervision costs, as well&#13;
as initial start-up and overhead costs of subsequent projects would be reduced and that a larger number&#13;
of oblasts could be included under such a funding mechanism. The role of the MOH (represented by&#13;
MSEI) as implementing agency for the MED Component is thus critical not just for purposes of the&#13;
present project but as a vehicle to channel lessons from the pilot to the rest of the country.&#13;
Summary of Project Benefits&#13;
6.21       Project benefits will accrue at two levels.  At the oblast level: (a) better quality health&#13;
services, greater consumer satisfaction, and improvements in health outcomes both during and after the&#13;
project for the populations of Kaluga and Tver; (b) more stable and transparent mechanism for public&#13;
financing of services to improve equity of access especially at the primary and secondary levels of care;&#13;
(c) more cost-effective health care systems able to produce better outcomes at current and expected&#13;
resource levels; and (d) stronger, more efficient health institutions, including individual health facilities,&#13;
Oblast Health Authorities, and Territorial Health Insurance Funds. For the country as a whole: (a) the&#13;
experience of two oblasts in implementing experimental reform measures in an internally consistent,&#13;
integrated fashion; (b) a stronger national capacity to monitor, evaluate and disseminate similar&#13;
experiments in health reform; and (c) a stronger national capacity to train Family Physicians.&#13;
6.22       The full impact of the project on health outcomes, both during and after the project life, is&#13;
impossible to quantify or predict. Targets for measurable changes in health outcomes in MCH and CVD&#13;
have been set (Annex 5.1) but, for reasons noted above, these are theoretical targets not based on actual&#13;
experience. The effects of system restructuring on cost-effectiveness is also difficult to quantify. In&#13;
Kaluga oblast, a 20 percent reduction in the number of beds in participating hospitals is planned during&#13;
the life of the project. However, focus group discussions with physicians in two participating rayon&#13;
hospitals in Kaluga indicated that up to 43 percent of cases could be moved to an outpatient setting,&#13;
assuming the appropriate care is made available on an outpatient basis. Hence the potential for continued&#13;
restructuring beyond the project lifetime is substantial, assuming that the improved and expanded&#13;
outpatient services are maintained. In effect, the full project impact is expected to exceed the direct&#13;
benefits from specific investments (in MCH, CVD, Family Practices, etc.) as a result of systemic changes&#13;
introduced through the project and the demonstration effect they would have within and beyond the two&#13;
pilot oblasts.&#13;
Sustainability and Fiscal Impact of the Project&#13;
6.23       The sustainability of health services in Russia is a central focus of the Project. Output-driven&#13;
incentive systems (with built-in caps to contain overall costs), outpatient-oriented care, and more efficient&#13;
and cost-conscious clinical practices all aim at defining a publicly-guaranteed package of services that is&#13;
affordable in the long run. However, while the restructuring from inpatient to outpatient care or from&#13;
ineffective to more cost-effective clinical practices takes place, the health system will go through a&#13;
transitional period of increased recurrent cost requirements. These increased costs result because: (i)&#13;
outpatient services must expand in range and improve in quality to replace inpatient care; (ii) badly-&#13;
needed quality improvements in inpatient services will involve higher recurrent costs and (iii) the fixed&#13;
costs of inpatient services are high and reductions in bed-days do not easily convert into full potential&#13;
savings until corresponding facility closings and staff retrenchment can take place.&#13;

Source: Memo from Dan Sherman and Victoria Golding re "Analysis of Data Obtained in Kaluga", April 13, 1995&#13;
6.24       Estimates prepared for the Kaluga Oblast Delivery System Restructuring Component indicate&#13;
a net increase. - by the end of the project period - of 43 percent in recurrent cost requirements in the&#13;
project areas (consisting of a 56 percent increase in Kaluga Municipality and a 13 percent increase in the&#13;
five project rayons) resulting directly from project investments. This reflects the net effect of increased&#13;
operating costs of enhanced outpatient services and limited quality enhancements in inpatient services,&#13;
and reduced operating costs resulting from bed closures. Increased requirements in Kaluga Municipality&#13;
are especially high because project investments include improvements in the Kaluga Municipal Hospital,&#13;
which accounts for 40 percent of the projected total recurrent cost requirements for the Municipality.&#13;
In addition, the Municipality requires a larger number of new primary care practices to attain the target&#13;
level of coverage and reduce dependence on specialists, which has been high historically because of the&#13;
wide presence of specialists in the oblast capital. Assuming that rayon and municipal health budgets grow&#13;
at the same rate as real output in the oblast - currently projected to grow by 37 percent between the years&#13;
1995 and 20032' - it is not unrealistic to expect that these additional recurrent costs can be absorbed by&#13;
the rayons and municipality if accompanied by further reductions in inpatient care and continued&#13;
improvements in overall efficiency in the long run.&#13;
6.25       From an oblast-wide perspective, the project's fiscal impact is less problematic. Table 6.3&#13;
shows the estimated fiscal impact of incremental recurrent costs generated by each oblast sub-project,&#13;
including all sub-project components but excluding sub-project management costs. These estimates&#13;
2'  In the absence of oblast-specific growth projections, the Bank's projections for changes in real output in Russia as a&#13;
whole are used.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Justification and Risks                                                              Page 59&#13;
indicate that by 2002, when the full impact of project investments would be in effect, incremental&#13;
recurrent costs would constitute 3.40 percent of Kaluga's total projected health expenditures from public&#13;
sources (including expenditures from the Health Insurance Fund). In Tver, incremental recurrent costs&#13;
would be 0.82 percent of total health expenditures. There is clearly much room for reallocation of&#13;
resources from within the overall health budgets of the oblasts to sustain the project in the long run.&#13;
6.26      Finally, Table 6.4 and Table 6.5 show the projected impact on oblast budgets of debt&#13;
repayment obligations resulting from the project.  These estimates are made using the following&#13;
assumptions on on-lending conditions: (i) only half of the loan amounts ($15 million per oblast) will be&#13;
on-lent to the oblast by the federal government; (ii) the repayment period is 14 years, with a grace period&#13;
of six years and the on-lending rate is 9.48% (a 2.5 percentage points spread over the Bank's rate).&#13;
These terms have been agreed upon between MOF and participating oblasts during the loan negotiations.&#13;
The tables show that, under these terms, repayment obligations would at no time exceed one percent of&#13;
projected total oblast budgets, with or without Health Insurance Fund revenues, for Kaluga and Tver&#13;
Oblasts.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
6.27      This is a high risk project. It is experimental in nature, involving substantial changes in&#13;
multiple dimensions of health care delivery, and taking place in a highly uncertain social, political and&#13;
economic context. The evolving situation with respect to governance structures in the sector is an&#13;
important part of this uncertain environment. The unstable fiscal positions of the participating oblasts&#13;
present the risk of shortfalls in resources to pay for additional recurrent costs required to improve the&#13;
quality of care. In addition, although individual sub-projects have been pared down in size and&#13;
complexity, the project's overall structure remains complex, with essentially two separate (sub)projects,&#13;
plus two federal-level components. The beneficiary institutions' lack of experience with standard project&#13;
procurement, accounting, and management procedures will add to the difficulties of implementation.&#13;
6.28      Risks associated with the experimental and reform-oriented nature of the project are mitigated&#13;
by strong ownership at the two oblasts where the project enjoys full support of oblast leadership including&#13;
managers of the Ob!ast Administration, Oblast Health Authorities and Territorial Health Insurance Funds.&#13;
The participatory process applied during preparation, with active involvement of the various teams that&#13;
would implement project activities, increases the chances of achieving well-coordinated projects and a&#13;
committed constituency. In addition, a close, mutually supportive, relationship has developed between&#13;
the two oblasts, resulting from jointly held activities during preparation (preparation workshops, training&#13;
seminars). The oblasts are now exploring possibilities for sharing TA experts and continuing joint&#13;
training programs during implementation. At the same time, because each oblast sub-project would be&#13;
implemented by different management teams, the managerial load would be reduced. The CSU is&#13;
designed in such a way as to support oblast PMUs without depriving them of their autonomy in both&#13;
project and loan management. Finally, first-year and mid-term project reviews will focus on any&#13;
problems resulting from project complexity and/or limited implementation capacity and may recommend&#13;
project restructuring if necessary.&#13;

ANNEX 1.1: Socioeconomic and Health Status in Kaluga and Tver&#13;
1.        This annex provides a brief picture of the socioeconomic and health conditions of Kaluga and Tver&#13;
oblasts. Additional information on the oblasts can be found in the project files.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.        Both Kaluga and Tver oblasts are located in Central Russia, within 200 kilometers of Moscow. The&#13;
capital city of each oblast has a long history, dating to the Middle Ages. Kaluga oblast covers 29,900 square&#13;
kilometers, and had a population of approximately 1,085,000 in 1994. It is smaller than Tver oblast, which&#13;
has a total land area of 84,200 square kilometers and a population of about 1,655,000. Tver is the largest oblast&#13;
in central Russia, with a low population density. Almost 75 percent of the citizens of Kaluga and Tver reside&#13;
in what are considered urban areas, with a large number living in the capital city (33 percent, or 360,400 in&#13;
Kaluga city; 28 percent, or 470,000 in Tver city).&#13;
3.        These oblasts have seen significant population decreases in recent years, steeper than that in Russia&#13;
as a whole, through a combination of steeply falling birth rates and slightly rising death rates. As a result, the&#13;
populations of both oblasts are aging. In 1994 the crude birth rate was 8.2 per 1,000 population in Kaluga and&#13;
the crude death rate 17.4 per 1,000 population. About 20 percent of the oblast's population is over age 60.&#13;
Prior to World War II, Tver Oblast reached its peak population of 2,900,000, about 75 percent larger than&#13;
today. Overall, about 18.7% of the population is over age 60, with an even higher proportion of aged (28.9%)&#13;
in rural areas. In 1994 the birth rate had fallen to 7.7 per 1,000 population, the lowest level since World War&#13;
Two. The death rate in 1994 was 21.0 per 1,000.&#13;
Socioeconomic Situation&#13;
4.        Although Kaluga and Tver share similar geographic and demographic characteristics, their economic&#13;
base varies. The economy of Kaluga oblast, especially before the break-up of the Soviet Union, was dominated&#13;
by the military-industrial complex. Kaluga was one of the centers of rocket technology as well as a center for&#13;
the production of engines for military use. The dominant sector is industry, which employs 34 percent of the&#13;
working population. The major industrial products are engines, turbines, electronics and railway machinery.&#13;
The social sector places second, with 20 percent of the work force, while agriculture accounts for 13 percent&#13;
of employment.&#13;
5.        Tver's economy has been built on trade, timber, textiles, cattle, and heavy manufacturing. In&#13;
addition to lumber, much of Tver's timber has been used to produce pulp paper, with a prominent parallel&#13;
industry emerging in printing and publishing. Beef and dairy cattle, as well as hog and chicken production,&#13;
continue to be important products. Tver has a national reputation for its linen and cotton fabrics. For over 100&#13;
years, Tver has manufactured over half of all the railroad cars used in Russia. Glass products, for both&#13;
industrial and home use, are also produced here.&#13;
6.        The economies of both regions have been hard hit by the break-up of the Soviet Union. Several&#13;
key industries in Tver oblast, especially textiles and manufacturing, have been dependent on historical trade&#13;
links with other geographic regions now considered independent states. In Kaluga oblast, many industrial&#13;
enterprises and military industries have slowed or stopped production. In both regions, high inflation and the&#13;
scarcity and high cost of consumer goods, including food and energy, has undermined the economy of most&#13;
families. Unemployment is on the rise and an increasing number of people are living below the official poverty&#13;
line.&#13;

Health Status&#13;
7.        As can be seen in Table 1, the health status of the populations of Kaluga and Tver reflects many&#13;
of the same characteristics found throughout Russia, and especially Central Russia. Life expectancy at birth&#13;
in Kaluga in 1994 declined to 60.1 for men, and 72.5 for women, a decrease of about two years from 1992.&#13;
In Tver, average life expectancy for males is 57 years and for females 71 years - with much lower figures&#13;
reported in rural villages. Both regions have suffered deteriorating health status for some years.&#13;
8.        Among adults, mortality from major chronic non-communicable diseases has increased considerably,&#13;
particularly cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. In addition, accidents and trauma have increased dramatically.&#13;
Underlying reasons for these increased mortality rates include three major factors. First, unhealthy lifestyles,&#13;
including diets high in fat, smoking, alcohol consumption increase rates of chronic disease. Second, high levels&#13;
of stress associated with the social and economic transition influence both health status and accident rates.&#13;
Third, the deterioration in the quality of health care services and the shortage of financing limit the ability to&#13;
respond to these problems.&#13;
9.         The health status of pregnant women and their infants is somewhat better in Kaluga than Tver,&#13;
although it is low in both oblasts when compared to other industrialized countries. In 1994, infant mortality&#13;
was 17.1 per 1,000 live births in Kaluga, a rate two times higher than in the countries of Europe and North&#13;
America. The corresponding figure for Tver was 19.5 per 1,000. In both oblasts, abortion remains the&#13;
primary means of fertility regulation, with almost two abortions for every live birth. According to official&#13;
statistics, only about one in five women in these regions use modern forms of contraception (19.3 percent in&#13;
Kaluga and 23 percent in Tver). Repeat abortion is a potential cause of infertility; abortion is also responsible&#13;
for at least 25 percent of maternal deaths nationwide. In Tver and Kaluga maternal mortality is four to five&#13;
times higher than in OECD countries (56 and 50.6 per 100,000 live births, respectively). A trend toward&#13;
increasing incidence of sexually transmitted infections also jeopardizes both reproductive health and infant&#13;
health.&#13;
Health Services&#13;
10.       Following the Russian pattern, both oblasts have a number of specialty and referral hospitals under&#13;
the direction of the Oblast Health Authority, with local authorities responsible for district hospitals, village&#13;
dispensaries, and feldsher stations. As a general rule, oblast and lower level institutions consist of both a&#13;
hospital and polyclinic, under the joint direction of the head doctor. In addition, in both Tver and Kaluga,&#13;
additional facilities are operated independently by the federal ministries of railroads, defense, nuclear energy,&#13;
and by some industrial enterprises.&#13;
11.       There are 12,500 hospital beds in Kaluga oblast, or about 115 beds for every 10,000 people. The&#13;
distribution of beds includes 5,100 beds in rayon and district hospitals; 1,280 at the Central Oblast Hospital;&#13;
2,765 in oblast specialist institutions; 2,500 beds in Kaluga municipality; 780 beds in sanitariums and 75 beds&#13;
for nursing care. There are 21,580 acute hospital beds in Tver Oblast, with an additional 1,171 beds located&#13;
in sanitariums or convalescent facilities. The ratio of acute beds to population is about 110 beds per 10,000 -&#13;
notably higher than ratios of 45 to 70 beds per 10,000 common in Europe and America, although slightly lower&#13;
than in Kaluga.&#13;
12.       The average length of stay in Kaluga oblast is 18.5 days, although it varies by specialty. In Tver,&#13;
the average hospital stay is in excess of 15 days. An additional period of recuperation in a sanitarium follows&#13;
most hospitalizations. Admission rates in both oblasts also seem excessive, strongly suggesting there is room&#13;
for more rational utilization of hospitals and beds. Both oblasts have taken initial steps to decrease capacity.&#13;
Because of continuing economic hardship, maintenance and repair of health facilities have suffered. Health&#13;
authorities also report extensive shortages of usable medical equipment and supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 1.1                                                                                 Page 67&#13;
Medical Education&#13;
13.       There is no medical academy in Kaluga oblast. Students wishing to study medicine must go to&#13;
Moscow, Smolensk, Tver, Rezan or elsewhere. There are, however, two medical colleges in Kaluga City. One&#13;
of them trains nurses and provides basic medical education for future doctors and paramedical workers. The&#13;
other college provides post-graduate training for all categories of health workers, now including doctors in&#13;
training for general practice.&#13;
14.       By contrast, the Tver Medical Academy is one of the oldest and highly respected medical education&#13;
centers in Russia. Tver Medical Academy has an enrollment of about 2,000, drawing students from nine&#13;
surrounding oblasts. Like other Russian medical schools, the Academy has historically concentrated on&#13;
preparing medical specialists rather than general practitioners. After successfully passing a state certification&#13;
exam, graduates pursue further specialization in one or more years of postgraduate residency at one of nine&#13;
larger hospitals in the oblast. A second certification exam is required after residency before a doctor is qualified&#13;
to practice in his or her selected specialty.  However, in recent years, the Academy has actively sought to&#13;
develop a program in family medicine.&#13;
Health System Financing&#13;
15.       As elsewhere in Russia, the financing of health services in Kaluga and Tver is complex and&#13;
dynamic. Historically, health services have been provided to the population free of charge. Prior to the break-&#13;
up of the Soviet Union, they were financed through allocations from the federal government. With the&#13;
decentralization of responsibility for health care to the oblast and local levels (beginning in the late 1980s), both&#13;
financing and allocation of resources for the vast majority of health services are local responsibilities. Today,&#13;
medical care provider payments are complicated both by multiple sources of funding and the different methods&#13;
used to pay hospitals, polyclinics, and physicians.&#13;
16.       Kaluga and Tver have both begun implementing the compulsory health insurance scheme mandated&#13;
by the federal government in 1991. Under that law, an earmarked tax of 3.6 percent is collected on all wages,&#13;
with 3.4 percent deposited in the Territorial Health Insurance Fund (THIF) and 0.2 percent transferred to the&#13;
Federal Compulsory Health Insurance Fund. Contributions to the THIF on behalf of the non-working&#13;
population (children, the unemployed, pensioners, etc.) come from local rayon and municipal governments.&#13;
The THIFs in both Kaluga and Tver have experienced shortfalls because rayon and local governments have&#13;
made lower contributions than planned, due to their own difficult financial situations.&#13;
17.       Additional funds come directly from the oblast consolidated budget, which in the case of Kaluga&#13;
includes substantial federal transfers. In 1994, 13 percent of the Kaluga oblast consolidated budget was spent&#13;
on health; the corresponding figure for Tver was 27 percent. Both oblasts fund the health care facilities that&#13;
are directly under their control from the consolidated oblast budget using the historical budgeting norms. Total&#13;
per capita spending on health care in 1994 was estimated at about 116,000 Roubles ($53) for Kaluga, and&#13;
138,000 Roubles ($63) for Tver. Private spending on health care is limited, but higher than in Soviet times.&#13;
In Kaluga, approximately 11 percent of health expenditures are estimated to be private; for Tver, this figure&#13;
is not available.&#13;
18.       Reforms in the Russian health care system began on an experimental basis before the break-up of&#13;
the Soviet Union. Based on early experiments in St. Petersburg, Kemerovo, and Novosibirsk, Kaluga developed&#13;
plans to establish general practice fundholding arrangements in the early 1990s. As a result of the rapid changes&#13;
occurring during the break-up of the Soviet Union, these plans were not implemented, although elements of&#13;
these reforms can be found in the project design for Kaluga. In recent years, Kaluga oblast has moved quickly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 68                                                                                             ANNEX  1.1&#13;
to implement the federal health insurance legislation and develop some expertise in payment options and&#13;
information systems. The THIF began operating in September 1993 and virtually all individuals in the oblast&#13;
are covered through the THIF. Except for two small insurance companies covering 20,000 people, the THIF&#13;
enters into contracts with medical care facilities and makes payments directly to these facilities. Doctors are&#13;
salaried employees of polyclinics and hospitals. Beginning in 1991, Kaluga began to pay hospitals on a per-&#13;
case basis, using a variant of the Clinical Statistical Groups (CSGs) developed in Kemerovo, St. Petersburg,&#13;
and other early experiences in provider payment reforms. Unfortunately, this attempt to control costs was&#13;
countered by an increase in the number of admissions in subsequent years. As a result, spending on inpatient&#13;
hospitals services increased from 45 percent of the total in 1991 to 59 percent in 1993.&#13;
19.         The THIF in Tver began collecting revenues in 1993. The Fund began to phase-in payments to&#13;
providers in January 1994; in January 1996, 26 out of 36 rayons were receiving payments from the THIF. In&#13;
the rayons not paid by the THIF, health facilities are reimbursed through the rayon budgets with payments based&#13;
on the historical budgeting system. The THIF reimburses hospitals on the basis of finished cases and polyclinics&#13;
on a per visit basis. In all facilities, doctors are salaried employees. A number of innovative provider&#13;
reimbursement arrangements have begun in Tver. The rayon hospital in Vishniy Volochok, for example, has&#13;
signed a contract with the THIF that includes incentives to economize: the hospital may retain any payments&#13;
it receives in excess of costs (up to 20 percent variance) if its patients are discharged earlier than the prescribed&#13;
norms. In addition, one oblast facility, the Children's Hospital, is being reimbursed on the basis of finished&#13;
cases.&#13;

ANNEX 3.1: Project Management and Implementation&#13;
A. Agreements Between Borrower and Implementing Agencies&#13;
1.         The Borrower (the Russian Federation) would be represented by the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MOF). MOF would on-lend Bank funds to the Kaluga and Tver oblasts, which are participating in the&#13;
project, except for the amounts which are allocated to finance two federal level components - the National&#13;
Program in Family Medicine, which would be conducted by the Moscow Sechenov Medical Academy&#13;
(MMA) and the Monitoring, Evaluation and Dissemination Component which would be carried out by&#13;
the MedSocEconomlnform (MSEI). Both Institutes belong to the Federal Ministry of Health (MOH).&#13;
On-lending arrangements would be reflected in:&#13;
(a)  subsidiary loan agreements (Oblast Agreements) between MOF, MOH and&#13;
the administrations of the participating oblasts;&#13;
(b)  appropriate agreements between MOF and MOH to channel the loan funds&#13;
to the Moscow Sechenov Academy and MSEI;&#13;
(c)  Project Coordination Agreement between MOF, MOH and the CSU of the Health Care&#13;
Foundation to delegate the responsibilities for overall project management and&#13;
implementation and utilization of loan funds;&#13;
(d)  appropriate agreements between the CSU (within the RHCF) and respective&#13;
Sub-borrowers to authorize the CSU to carry out procurement transactions&#13;
and process payments related to project activities out of the loan proceeds&#13;
on behalf of Sub-borrowers.&#13;
These agreements would (i) cover implementation responsibilities, (ii) provide a legal basis for the timely&#13;
flow of loan funds to the project beneficiaries, (iii) lay down the repayment obligations of the&#13;
beneficiaries, and (iv) articulate assurances from the Sub-borrowers to provide local funding for the&#13;
respective sub-projects.&#13;
B. Responsibilities of Implementing Agencies&#13;
2.         A Steering Committee, chaired by the Minister of Health, would carry out overall project&#13;
supervision. The Committee has already been established (for list of members and Terms-of-Reference&#13;
refer to Annex 3.2).&#13;
3.         A Central Support Unit (CSU) has been set up in Moscow to carry out day-to -day project&#13;
management and implementation. In August 1996, the MOF informed the Bank of Government's decision&#13;
to merge the management units for the Medical Equipment Project and for the Health Reform Pilot&#13;
Project. The CSU has become a part of the Health Care Foundation which was registered at the Federal&#13;
Ministry of Justice as an independent legal entity on November 29, 1996. To reduce the cost of both&#13;
projects, it was decided that both management units of the Medical Equipment Project and Health Reform&#13;
Pilot Project respectively would have a shared group of staff with skills and qualifications indispensable&#13;
for both projects. This group would include four sub-groups: (i) Accounting and Disbursement, (ii)&#13;
Procurement, (iii) Personnel and Legal Issues and (iv) Administrative Support. In addition, a Procurement&#13;
Consulting Firm would be contracted by the CSU to carry out procurement of goods and works under&#13;
ICB and NCB procedures. The CSU staff would be hired as individual consultants and paid locally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

            The Health Reform Pilot Project's
            objective is to achieve improvements in the quality and
            efficiency of health care and in reproductive and
            cardiovascular health outcomes in two pilot oblasts
            sufficient to make decisions about national adoption of
            specific health reform measures. The project consists of
            four parts: two independent sub-projects, each consisting of
            a package of reform measures to be undertaken in a
            participating oblast; one component to strengthen national
            and regional training programs in Family Medicine; and one
            component to monitor, evaluate, disseminate and replicate
            project results. Although the underlying principles of
            reform are the same, each oblast sub-project is unique,
            having been shaped by local oblast priorities, institutional
            capacities, and other local conditions.
