Performance improvement planning helps service providers in bringing about incremental improvements&#13;
in services by applying the principles of commercial orientation and financial viability. This overview paper&#13;
discusses the context for performance improvement plans in India, and the key elements and objectives&#13;
that such strategies should constitute.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  Performance improvement plans must be based on cost recovery, operational&#13;
  efficiency, and improved demand management. They should be supported by&#13;
  a robust financial model and a strong performance monitoring system.&#13;

     Box 1: Why is Performance Improvement Necessary?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The basic aim of the performance improvement series is to help water utilities and service providers understand and&#13;
     adopt mechanisms that promote compliance with adequate service standards, cost recovery, and sustainable revenue&#13;
     strategies, as well as help achieve financially viable and sustainable improved services. The objective is to be able to&#13;
     focus not only on specific performance improvement areas by advancing technical, commercial, and operational&#13;
     efficiency--such as leak reduction, billing and collection, customer service, and tariff setting, among others--but also&#13;
     ensure that such improvements remain sustainable and viable in the long term through arrangements such as&#13;
     performance agreements, monitoring and evaluation, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
     Performance improvement planning helps service providers in bringing about incremental improvements in services by&#13;
     applying the principles of commercial orientation and financial viability. They must be supported by institutional reform&#13;
     with appropriate incentives and broader financial accounting reforms if they are to remain sustainable in the long run.&#13;
&#13;
     Issue No. 1 is an overview paper that discusses the context for performance improvement plans in India, and the key&#13;
     elements and objectives that such strategies should constitute. Subsequent field notes will focus on the identified and&#13;
     important elements of such plans.&#13;

     Principle                                       Description&#13;
&#13;
     Cost efficiency and cost recovery               Revenue stream generated from tariffs should be relatively stable and not&#13;
                                                     cause cash flow or financing difficulties for the utility.&#13;
&#13;
     Economic efficiency                             Signal to consumers the financial and other costs that their decision to use&#13;
                                                     water impose on the rest of the system.&#13;
&#13;
     Resource conservation                           Discourage excessive or wasteful uses of water, thus promoting the&#13;
                                                     conservation of depleting sources or the sustainable use of renewable&#13;
                                                     water sources.&#13;
&#13;
     Affordability                                   Affordable for poor people and low income communities.&#13;
&#13;
     Equity and fairness                             Treats similar customers equally and customers in different situations&#13;
                                                     differently, and may mean some policy measures to subsidize poor people and&#13;
                                                     low income communities.&#13;
&#13;
     Acceptability                                   Free from public criticism and not objectionable to political leaders.&#13;
&#13;
     Simplicity                                      Easy to understand.&#13;
&#13;
     Feasibility                                     Administratively, the tariff should be such that its implementation can be&#13;
                                                     undertaken at minimum cost.&#13;
&#13;
     Transparency                                    Implementation, including the structure of the tariff, should be transparent.&#13;

    Each aspect has a set of objectives that are to be achieved on a yearly basis.                 be used by the central and state&#13;
    A set of indicators are measured for each objective. For instance, for                         governments to put in place mandatory&#13;
    monitoring financial aspects, the company has set itself a target of maximizing                disclosure norms for water service&#13;
    revenue generation from water supply within the Jamshedpur service area.                       providers to report on performance,&#13;
&#13;
    To ensure that this objective is met, the company is continuously monitoring                   which could then be used as indicators&#13;
&#13;
    revenue generation from five sources: revenue from potable water in                            for delivering intergovernmental&#13;

    Each indicator or benchmark is monitored against the previous year's data&#13;

Training and development of the&#13;

workforce and operating staff is a&#13;
&#13;
key element that helps staff implement&#13;
&#13;

performance improvement plans.&#13;
&#13;
Given that such plans would be&#13;
targeting improvements within&#13;
service delivery, and there may be&#13;
new ways to undertake these&#13;
improvements, it is important to develop&#13;
a comprehensive, ongoing,&#13;
and consistent training program that&#13;
keeps staff motivated during the period&#13;
when performance improvement plans&#13;
are being undertaken as well as help&#13;
staff learn new concepts so that they are&#13;
able to implement new work practices&#13;
and procedures for improving&#13;
performance. In addition, workforce&#13;
training and development will not go too&#13;
far unless it is supported by proper         Consultation and                           of the potential benefits of such plans.&#13;
incentives that can persuade staff to                                                   These programs should commence&#13;
undertake such activities. Operating staff   Communication                              very early on in the change process&#13;

and given suitable incentives to                                                        community during the implementation&#13;

            Performance improvement planning :
            Upgrading and improving urban water services
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The water supply and sanitation sector
            in India continues to be plagued with severe deficiencies in
            the availability, quality, and equity of services. Though
            access to infrastructure may be increasing in some cases,
            access to reliable, sustainable, and affordable water supply
            and sanitation services remains poor in general. Services
            remain deficient, with water available for only few hours a
            day; many remain unconnected to the network, and wastewater
            is disposed of without adequate treatment. Consumers often
            spend large sums of money on expensive and unsafe
            alternatives to cope with poor services. Performance
            improvement planning helps service providers in bringing
            about incremental improvements in services by applying the
            principles of commercial orientation and financial
            viability. This overview paper discusses the context for
            performance improvement plans in India, and the key elements
            and objectives that such strategies should constitute.
            Performance improvement plans must be based on cost
            recovery, operational efficiency, and improved demand
            management. They should be supported by a robust financial
            model and a strong performance monitoring system.
