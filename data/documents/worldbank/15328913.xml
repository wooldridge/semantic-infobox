CHAIRMAN:        Gentlemen, shall we come to order?           We have only the approval of the&#13;
&#13;
                 mirmtea on the formal agenda.         You have    al~    seen those, but before we&#13;
&#13;
                 ask for approval of them, I want to introduce some nell figures around&#13;
&#13;
                 the Board.      Sir Gordon llunro has introduced to me this morning, his new&#13;
&#13;
                 a~te:rna.te,   Mr. Figgurea.    Mr. Figgures, will you stBJXl up and take a bow?&#13;
&#13;
                 We also have not exactly a new figure but an old figure in Mr. Michalski,&#13;
&#13;
                 lIho is the alternate for Mr. Baranski, and this is his last meeting with&#13;
&#13;
                 us.   'Mr.   Micha~ski,   we want to say goodbye to you, and thank you very much&#13;
&#13;
                 for your     ~oyal   service to theÂ· Bank.     'Mr. Baranski haa     a~so   jntroduced to&#13;
&#13;
                 me his new alternate, Mr.       Ko~ovic.     We are very sorry to see Yr. Michalski&#13;
&#13;
                 go, and are glad to       we~come   the nell - I was about to say figures - but I&#13;
&#13;
                 shall not.      Oh, one thing more, I want to introduce Mr. Iliff', the new&#13;
&#13;
                 Loan Director, to those of you who have not already met him - Mr. llif'f.&#13;
&#13;
                 Are there any comments on the minutes of the 120th Reguhr Meeting of the&#13;
&#13;
                 Executive Directors?        If not, I   dec~re      them approved.&#13;
&#13;
                 Unless there is something on the formal agenda that anyone wants to bring&#13;
&#13;
                 up, I think, i f I may, I will pass          ri~t    to the informal meeting.       In that&#13;
&#13;
                 connection I want to make a statement about the proposed                ~oan   to Poland.&#13;
&#13;
                  There has been a good bit of comment in the press about it, and a&#13;
&#13;
                 situation has developed in connection with it.               I think we should bring&#13;
&#13;
                 it before the Board at this time in: order to keep you fully advised of what&#13;
&#13;
                 the status is.        I dictated a statement here, which I am going to read,&#13;
&#13;
                 because I want to be sure to get all the points in it.&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAIRMAN:              Poland submitted a loan application to the International Bank in&#13;
(C   'd)&#13;
             September 1946, for $600,000,000 to finance import requirements over a&#13;
&#13;
             period of three years for the general reconstruction and development of&#13;
&#13;
             Poland as outlined in a Plan of Economic Reconstruction in Which, in a&#13;
&#13;
             general wa:y, future production targets in industry and agriculture were&#13;
&#13;
             set.   Initial studies by the Bank indicated that application of loan monies&#13;
&#13;
             to the Polish coal industry would probably yield the largest and quickest&#13;
&#13;
             results qy assisting in the increase of Polish coal production, which in&#13;
&#13;
             turn, would be of speedy and essential benefit, not only to Poland, but&#13;
&#13;
             also to the Bank's members in Europe.      The Polish authorities were asked&#13;
&#13;
             to submit and submitted further more detailed data on Polani's coal industry.&#13;
&#13;
                         In the summer of 1947, the Bank, at the invitation of the Polish&#13;
&#13;
             Government, sent a fact-finding group of four to Poland to study the Polish&#13;
&#13;
             economy on the ground; the group included an engineering consultant retained&#13;
&#13;
             for the purpose of examining the operations of the Polish coal industry.&#13;
&#13;
             On completion of its studies, the International Bank proposed to the Polish&#13;
&#13;
             authorities for discussion a short-term loan, of moderate amount, in line&#13;
&#13;
            . with its available loan funds and designed to assiSt. in increasing coal ship-&#13;
&#13;
             ments as quickly as possible to its members in Western Europe over the next&#13;
&#13;
             few years.     At the outset of such discussiollB, the Bank emphasized that&#13;
&#13;
             this was the onl.y type of loan which, under existing conditions, would be&#13;
&#13;
             feasible.     It was made clear that the Bank could not, at this time, con-&#13;
&#13;
             sider a long-term loan for the long range modernization and rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
             of the Polish coal industry, nor for general reconstruction purposes in&#13;
&#13;
             Poland.     The Bank, in accordance with the views of the engineering consultant,&#13;
&#13;
             proposed a list of imports of mining machinery and equipment designed to&#13;
&#13;
             eliminate bottlenecks, and thus to aid in a quick increase in coal production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 677 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CHftTtlMAN:   Included in the list were items to replace machinery am equi.pment worn&#13;
(c.   J'd)&#13;
              out and not replaced because of shortages during the war, soma replacement&#13;
&#13;
              equipment and facilities for related industries such as coke; ovens, steel&#13;
&#13;
              mills, and electric power, and a general reserve for mining supplies and&#13;
&#13;
              for "bits and pieces" to assist in maintaining the pipeline of these items&#13;
&#13;
              and thus to prevent the frequent production stoppages occurring because of&#13;
&#13;
              sudden breakdowns of relatively inexpensive but key machinery- installations.&#13;
&#13;
              The question of financing new mines to add to existing capacity was not&#13;
&#13;
              considered.&#13;
&#13;
                       The Bank felt that a loan for the above purposes should be&#13;
&#13;
              amortized in the shortest practicable time.     The Bank estimated that,&#13;
&#13;
              with the aid of such a loan, Poland should be able to increase its coal&#13;
&#13;
              exports to western Europe substantially over the next few years.     Because&#13;
&#13;
              of the high current prices and the great demand for coal in Europe, it was&#13;
&#13;
              also estimated that the proceeds of only a relatively small i'raction of&#13;
&#13;
              Poland's scheduled increase in coal exports would be required to repay the&#13;
&#13;
              loan being discussed.   Since the current price level for coal is considered&#13;
&#13;
              abnormally high and profitable, the Bank considered that Poland should&#13;
&#13;
              retire the loan 'While such conditions exist.&#13;
&#13;
                      ,The Bank also asked that, anxmg the terms of the loan, there should&#13;
&#13;
              be guarantees that the essential purposes of the financing would be fuJ.-&#13;
&#13;
              filled, and that a major portion of Poland's increased coal exports, in&#13;
&#13;
              agreed amounts, should, during the life of the loan, go to Bank members&#13;
&#13;
              in Europe, and to Sweden, SWitzerland,   ~d   Austria, and that no more than&#13;
&#13;
              a specified anount would go to aI\V of such countries without the approval&#13;
&#13;
              of the Bank.   Several protective features were requested of Poland by the&#13;
&#13;
              Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           - 678 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CH     "MAN:            The suggested amount of the loan was between $53,250,000 and&#13;
(Ct. â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ " 'd)&#13;
                $58,250,000, to be repaid in seven years, with reduced amortization pay-&#13;
&#13;
                ments in the first two years to allow for the shipment and installation&#13;
&#13;
                in Poland of some of the machinery and equipment.    While substantial&#13;
&#13;
                agreement was reached with the Polish negotiator on many of the terms and&#13;
&#13;
                conditions of the proposed loan, the Polish Government has countered our&#13;
&#13;
                proposed term of seven years with a request for a fifteen year loan with&#13;
&#13;
                no amortization for the first five years.   We have advised the negotiator&#13;
&#13;
                that a term longer than seven years would not be in keeping with the special&#13;
&#13;
                nature and purposes of the financing.&#13;
&#13;
                         However, aside from the question of satisfactory terms, develop-&#13;
&#13;
                ments have brought the management of the Bank: to the conclusion, and I&#13;
&#13;
                have so stated in press conferences and elsewhere, that it is impraotioal&#13;
&#13;
                for us to make any substantial loans in Europe pending developments and&#13;
&#13;
                olarification of the European Recovery Program.     Even though Poland is&#13;
&#13;
                not one of the nations partioipating in this program, the question of her&#13;
&#13;
                ability to obtain dollars for repayment of a loan from the Bank would appear&#13;
&#13;
                to be equally involved in the recovery program.&#13;
                         Moreover, I made inquiries quite informally from some of the&#13;
&#13;
                higher officials of the United states Government as to the effect which&#13;
&#13;
                the pendency of the E. R. P. J:n Congress might have on their attitude toward&#13;
&#13;
                a loan to Poland.   I gained the definite impression from them that the&#13;
&#13;
                approval on the part of the U. S. of a loan to Poland at this time raised&#13;
&#13;
                serious questions in their minds.   While these officials made it quite&#13;
&#13;
                clear that they wished in no way to suggest the course which the Bank or&#13;
&#13;
                its staff should take in the matter, they did feel that if a proposal were&#13;
&#13;
                put forward an approval on the part of the U.S. of such a loan would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 679 -&#13;
&amp;#12;         doubtful at this time.   In view of this I concluded that it would be unwise&#13;
&#13;
         to proceed further with the negotiations 'Without notifying the represent-&#13;
&#13;
         atives of Poland of these facts.   After giving the matter very careful con-&#13;
&#13;
         sideration I have felt also that it would be undesirable fran the point of&#13;
&#13;
         view of the Bank itself to present the matter of such a loan to the Board&#13;
&#13;
         at this time.&#13;
&#13;
                  I have, therefore, informed the Polish representative, as well&#13;
&#13;
         as the Polish Executive Director, that I am not prepared to recommend a&#13;
&#13;
         loan at the present time.   However, I have told the Polish representative&#13;
&#13;
         that we would be prepared to continue negotiations concerning the various&#13;
&#13;
         terms of a loan, with a view to being in a position to take prompt action&#13;
&#13;
         if and when conditions are so altered as to justify or make desirable the&#13;
&#13;
         presentation of the matter of a loan to Poland to the Board.&#13;
&#13;
         Now as I said in that statement, I made some approaches quite informally.&#13;
&#13;
         I scarcely consider them approaches as a matter of fact, because they were&#13;
&#13;
         unofficial and informal, to members of the U.S. Government and because I&#13;
&#13;
         think it is more appropriate that any official contact should be made&#13;
&#13;
         through the U.S. Executive Director.     I told the U.S. Executive Director&#13;
&#13;
         of the information I bad about it, and I asked him to communicate himself&#13;
&#13;
         with the U.S. C-overnment officials in order to clarify the relationShip&#13;
&#13;
         and the position.   Mr. Black, do you want to add anything to what I have&#13;
&#13;
         said?&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:   My Government has no objection to the International Bank Management&#13;
&#13;
         continuing negotiations on this loan with the Polish Government.     I 'WOuld&#13;
&#13;
         like to make it clear that my Government has not attempted in any way to&#13;
&#13;
         dissuade the Management of the Bank from carrying on these discussions or&#13;
&#13;
         from making any recommendation that the President of the Bank wanted to&#13;
&#13;
         make to the Board about this loan.     However, I think that the 'Management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        - 680 -&#13;
&amp;#12;BL.           of the Bank is wise in not submitting this loan to the Directors at this&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
              time, because it would be very difficult for my Government to vote in&#13;
&#13;
              favor of such a loan without being accused of inconsistenc,y.     We have said&#13;
&#13;
              that we do not expect to make any advances to any European Government until&#13;
&#13;
              the Marshall Plan is enacted, and it would therefore be quite difficult for&#13;
&#13;
              the U.S. Government to give approval to the loan to Poland, particularlT&#13;
&#13;
              in view of the fact that Poland was one of the countries that.did not join&#13;
&#13;
              up with the Marshall Plan.   I   thin~urther,   that if a loan t.o Poland. was&#13;
&#13;
              made at this time by the Bank, and the U.S. Government gave :i. ts approval,&#13;
&#13;
              it might well jeopardize the enactment of the Marshall Plan.      You probablT&#13;
&#13;
              have noticed a recent article in a Washington paper, and I think that is&#13;
&#13;
              the type of publicity ;you would get allover the country.      It. certainly&#13;
&#13;
              would not be helpful as far as the enactment of the Marshall Plan is&#13;
&#13;
              concerned.   Still further, we have been making earnest efforts to build&#13;
&#13;
              up our credit, and build up our bond market.     I can assure you that if a&#13;
&#13;
              loan to Poland were announced at this time, a lot of those efforts would&#13;
&#13;
              have been in vain.   I think t.bat is about all I have to say, sir.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIffi4AN:   :Mr. Baranski?&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKIs     Mr. Chairman, as TOU know, I have participated in some cOllVersations with&#13;
&#13;
              you and with:Mr. Zoltowski, in which TOU have raised the theme before us,&#13;
&#13;
              and we appreciate the friendliness with which you have approached us in&#13;
&#13;
              this delicate matter.   WE;' took notice of your remarks, l'Ihich were sub-&#13;
&#13;
              stantiallT the same as were read by you today, and we have transmitted&#13;
&#13;
              them to the Polish Government for the final decision as to what to do&#13;
&#13;
              now.   I know that Mr. Zoltowski suggested agreement with your proposal&#13;
&#13;
              and continuing the negotiations.      The matter of presenting the loan to&#13;
&#13;
              the Board is a difficult question now, because the negotiations have not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 681 -&#13;
&amp;#12;been concluded.   While it is a cautious way in which you have approached&#13;
&#13;
the matter, materially it does not change the situation that we are not&#13;
&#13;
ready with the negotiations.    So I want to reserve for   D\1seli your per-&#13;
&#13;
mission to come back to this question again when the Polish answer comes&#13;
&#13;
back, or at any time when we might have the impression that Polam is&#13;
&#13;
being discriminated against by the Bank or by azv Director or the Bank&#13;
&#13;
in respect of the other CÂ«)vernments who are participating in the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
activity.    For the moment I can say that such a moment has not arrived&#13;
&#13;
in my opinion, and I am very glad to express our entire satisfaction with&#13;
&#13;
the impartiality and friendliness with which you have always treated the&#13;
&#13;
matter of our loan.    That does not mean that I personally" agree with the&#13;
&#13;
material decision that the Bank has taken as to the condi tiona of the loan.&#13;
&#13;
For instance, I have alread;y had the opportunity to raise in the Financial&#13;
&#13;
Policy Committee, the question whether it is wise for the Bank to grant&#13;
&#13;
one countr,y loans for articles, such as investment goods on short term,&#13;
&#13;
and on the other hand be very liberal in granting loans to ot.her countries&#13;
&#13;
for raw materials or for fuel, on long term.    It may be said that it depends&#13;
&#13;
on the position of the Bank, but it is very dangerous for the Bank to change&#13;
&#13;
its entire policy because of its changed position.    Only remember that I&#13;
&#13;
have raised this subject.    While the matter is still in negot.iations, I&#13;
&#13;
would not like to go further in the subject.    May I only refer to one thing&#13;
&#13;
that does not occur in the Bank, but frequently in the Press.     It criticized&#13;
&#13;
Poland for not participating in the Marshall Plan and therefore it is,&#13;
&#13;
so to say, breaking the Marshall Plan.    I think that this is the   ri~t    place&#13;
&#13;
to say that all the advantages, all the assets which Poland could bring into&#13;
&#13;
the Marshall Plan are still available for Western Europe under the present&#13;
&#13;
situation.    The Polish Government has accepted the Bank's suggestion to&#13;
&#13;
give the Bank a statement about the coal export countries.     As Mr. McCloy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 682 -&#13;
&amp;#12;SA   SKI:        has said, the benefit would be the same as Poland would be able to con-&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
                 tribute under the Marshall Plan.    Poland I s participation in European&#13;
&#13;
                 recovery is practically the same.    All that is lost are the benefits&#13;
&#13;
                 Poland would have from the Marshall Plan, aIXl for that, Poland cannot be&#13;
&#13;
                 reproached.   For the moment, I repeat that I would ask you to put the&#13;
&#13;
                 matter before the Board again if necessary.     I thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
BASYN:           Am I to uIXlerstand from Mr. Black I s remarks that the Bank wouJ..d oppose&#13;
&#13;
                 any loan made to Europe before the implementation of the Marshall Plan?&#13;
BLACK:           The United states Government is not making any grants through the Export-&#13;
&#13;
                 Import Bank until the Marshall Plan is resolved.     I was talking about the&#13;
&#13;
                 Uni ted states Government.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        I have said on the other hand that we could make no substantial loans peJXl-&#13;
&#13;
                 ing clarification of the European Recovery Program.&#13;
&#13;
VA.. ARESSOS J   Mr. Chairman, I want to stress the fact that in this Bank there was no wish&#13;
&#13;
                 and no tendency, to ShOlf a1\V discrimination towards any country which&#13;
&#13;
                 participates in the Bank.    Any country which is a member of the Bank, has&#13;
&#13;
                 contributed its direct contribution, aIXl has undertaken to guarantee the&#13;
&#13;
                 80% of its shares is in the same position as all other countries.        1nde-&#13;
&#13;
                 pendently of the other activities of the Bank I don't think the Bank has&#13;
&#13;
                 the intention to show discrimination.    I should like however, to     stress&#13;
&#13;
                 the fact that it will be impossible, if not inconceivable, that whilst&#13;
&#13;
                 the Bank declares that it is not prepared to make loans to partiCipating&#13;
&#13;
                 countries whilst the Marshall Plan is pending, the Bank should decide to&#13;
&#13;
                 make a loan to a country because it is not a member of the 'Marshall Plan.&#13;
&#13;
                 This would not be diSCrimination, but it would discriminate against the&#13;
&#13;
                 Marshall Plan countries, which the Bank has no intention of doing.         I am&#13;
&#13;
                 sure that so long as this declaration is there, no loans can possibly be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 683 -&#13;
&amp;#12;VAf--' RES$OS :   made.   Otherwise it mIl be interpreted that participation in the 'Marshall&#13;
(Cu: .. Jd)&#13;
                  Plan is not advantageous, and that the Bank mIl restrict their activities.&#13;
&#13;
                  I think there is no question at all of discrimination.    You remember I&#13;
&#13;
                  have stated here that I come from a country which might make it an induce-&#13;
&#13;
                  ment to think otherwise.   In the development of policies, we work towards&#13;
&#13;
                  collaboration between Western and Eastern Europe, and I will be surprised&#13;
&#13;
                  if we shall not attain some success.     So the Bank will not mix itself.     I&#13;
&#13;
                  want to make a remark about the attitude of non-participating countries&#13;
&#13;
                  to the Marshall Plan.   I don't think it is enough to say that a country&#13;
&#13;
                  was prepared to help as if it really participated.     The idea of the Marshall&#13;
&#13;
                  Plan was a complete collaboration, not only in the sense that some surplus&#13;
&#13;
                  goods might be sold to the lJestern coliJ1tries, but collaboration towards,&#13;
&#13;
                  the reconstruct.ion, and the revival of the economy of Europe.    We must&#13;
&#13;
                  admit that many difficulties encountered now are due to the f'act that all&#13;
&#13;
                  the countries of Europe are not participating in this field of concerted&#13;
&#13;
                  economic and financial policies.   So I don't think it is enough to say that.&#13;
&#13;
                  It is a pity, ani it is a very bad thing for the whole effort, that some&#13;
&#13;
                  countries have decided not to participate.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:         Are there any comments?&#13;
&#13;
BRESCIANI:        May I ask in connection with the problem of financing loans by the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                  for an explanation, for my personal infonnation, since I do not know the&#13;
&#13;
                  fundamental prinCiples in connection with loans.     In the memorandum on&#13;
&#13;
                  loan policy I read that the current policy of the Bank must be one of&#13;
&#13;
                  making successive advances to individual borrowing countries to meet their&#13;
&#13;
                  most important needs as they arise; that the Bank will help in the initial&#13;
&#13;
                  phases and assist a country to develp its own self help, as the project&#13;
&#13;
                  progresses.   Now I feel a bit perplexed about this,since, for instance,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 684 -&#13;
&amp;#12;BR't"   ~tANI:   a borrowing country might make a project concerning agricultural develop-&#13;
(C6_ ... 'd)&#13;
                 ment or extension of electric power plants and so forth.     The development,&#13;
&#13;
                 or the execution of this project will take perhaps two or three years.&#13;
&#13;
                 In Italy, for instance, the problem concerning the develppmant of electric&#13;
&#13;
                 power forecasts a period of five or six years.     A borrowing country must&#13;
&#13;
                 be sure that it will get the money for the entire project.      Otherwise i f&#13;
&#13;
                 it gets only the first installment and is not sure that it will get further&#13;
&#13;
                 installments, no program is possible.      The loan made by the Bank requires&#13;
&#13;
                 a very complicated pro gram of internal financing, since most of the entire&#13;
&#13;
                 costs, will be represented not by external expenses to be expended for the&#13;
&#13;
                 importation of foreign goods, but by internal costs, so that it is very&#13;
&#13;
                 complicated.     I do not know what will be the policy of the Bank only to&#13;
&#13;
                 give the first installment.     I should like to have an interpretation of&#13;
&#13;
                 this.     A borrowing country will present to the Bank several. independent&#13;
&#13;
                 projects, for instance, concerning electric power developments, a maritime&#13;
&#13;
                 fleet, a project on agricultural development, and so on.      The Bank will&#13;
&#13;
                 begin by financing one or two of these projects.Â· In the event that the&#13;
&#13;
                 loan is approved by the Bank, i f the economic consequences are approved,&#13;
&#13;
                 the Bank will pay the next year for the second project, but as it concerns&#13;
&#13;
                 one and the same project it must be financed from the beginning entirely.&#13;
&#13;
                 That is    ~   impression.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRtdAN:       That is right.     We would not want to build a bridge half way across the&#13;
&#13;
                 river and leave it suspended there without prospects of reaching the other&#13;
&#13;
                 side.     We cannot on the other hand, cozmnit ourselves to a large five year&#13;
&#13;
                 plan of financing.      We have not the money in the Bank and we are dependent&#13;
&#13;
                 upon the market.      We do not know when we can raise money and men we cannot.&#13;
&#13;
                 We hope to have continuity, but it would be foolish f or us to commit our-&#13;
&#13;
                 selves i f we did not see the money in hand.     Vihat we try to do is to get&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 685 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHl.   AAN:   an integrated project and finance that in its complete entirety.           That may&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
              mean we have to take rather smaller bites than some people would like to&#13;
&#13;
              have us take, but we are alive to other projects which in a period of years&#13;
&#13;
              will represent a substantial. plan.      I think everybody agrees tJ:1at is our&#13;
&#13;
              policy.    I do not think of anything else.        I think we might just leave&#13;
&#13;
              this, if it is agreeable to the Board.       I put it on the informal agenda,&#13;
&#13;
              but if there is any reason to put in on the formal agenda we "Will be happy&#13;
&#13;
              to put it there.    We can always refer back to this.        I do not think it&#13;
&#13;
              calls for arry action on the part of the Board at this time.         The only&#13;
&#13;
              other think I can think of is that we might have a general report from&#13;
&#13;
              Mr. Black on the status of the market and perhaps a little bit about&#13;
              Massachusetts.     We would not feel the meeting was complete without a&#13;
&#13;
              report from him.&#13;
&#13;
BLAtiK:       The market for our bonds, I think, is in some respects in the best shape&#13;
&#13;
              it has been for some time.     The bonds are at a discount from their original&#13;
&#13;
              offering price, but after the bonds were first sold and when they declined,&#13;
&#13;
              there was a very unsatisfactory market position.          That was undesirable&#13;
&#13;
              and we have made every possible effort to undo that situation.          We have&#13;
&#13;
              accomplished that job and the bonds have gone out of the hands of these&#13;
&#13;
              dealers into real investment hands, insurance companies,         sav~ngs   banks,&#13;
&#13;
              and commercial. banks.    So at this time I think the market is barer of&#13;
&#13;
              our bonds than it ever has been.      It would be difficult for anyone to&#13;
&#13;
              buy a sizeable alOOunt of our bonds without pushing the market up rather&#13;
&#13;
              substantial.1y.    Last week our bonds went up a point, went from 9S to 96,&#13;
&#13;
              and that was in spite of the fact that practical.ly all other bonds went&#13;
&#13;
              down.     So our bonds went contrary to the rest of the market, and at the&#13;
&#13;
              moment we feel very pleased with the whole situation.          In cormection with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                             - 686 -&#13;
&amp;#12;,   .                                                       (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BL      :   Massachusetts, we are having quite a battle.        The bill legalizing our bonds&#13;
(Cont1d)&#13;
            was approved by the Committee unanimously; it was introduced in the House,&#13;
&#13;
            and   wa~   passed unanimously.   It came up yesterday in the Senate and we&#13;
&#13;
            discovered at the last minute that there was going to be real opposition.&#13;
&#13;
            We did a little wire pulling and I think we stopped the oppOSition, and post-&#13;
&#13;
            poned the debate until today.       The bill comee up for debate today in the&#13;
&#13;
            Senate and we are hopeful it will go through.        If it does it will have a&#13;
&#13;
            good effect on the market.        I have a letter here.   I think you might like&#13;
&#13;
            to hear partof this.      It is a letter from Lord Balfour, of Ll.oyds Bank&#13;
&#13;
            of London.      I saw him last Fall.   It says, "You will be glad to know that&#13;
&#13;
            it has been agreed, in principle, between the Standard Bank of South Africa&#13;
&#13;
            and the South African Reserve Bank that each institution will apply for&#13;
&#13;
            dollar bonds of the International Bank to the amount of $1 million.&#13;
&#13;
            Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) the other principal South&#13;
&#13;
            African bank has, I understand, decided not to make a similar application.&#13;
&#13;
            I am very glad indeed that you are likely shortly to be able to inscribe&#13;
&#13;
            an additional country on your list of bondholders."        That is very interest-&#13;
&#13;
            ing and very important, because that represents the first time I knOw that&#13;
&#13;
            any central bank has been willing to buy any of our bonds.         The amount is&#13;
&#13;
            not very much, but I think that we could use this to great advantage in&#13;
&#13;
            this market.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   South Africa has been ver:f partial and very vigorous in helping us in our&#13;
&#13;
            securities.      The legislation is very favorable and I hope that similar&#13;
&#13;
            action and attitu:les can be made      general~.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUNRO:      I should like, if I may, to ask our American colleague if he can give us&#13;
&#13;
            any more information.      For instance, I know that 'Massachusetts is an&#13;
&#13;
            extremely important centre because so many insurance companies are there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 687 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                             (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
}l   ):             On the assumption that this approving legislation is passed, and our bonds&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
                    are legal, just what do you eII'lisage from that?    Do you envisage that a&#13;
&#13;
                    number of institutions will start looking around to get some of our bonds,&#13;
&#13;
                    or do you eII'lisage that you regard them really as being potential buyers&#13;
&#13;
                    of our bonds the next time we make an issue.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:              Well, I have envisaged several things.     The first is that insurance companies&#13;
&#13;
                    at the present time may not have much surplus funds.       They are fully invest-&#13;
&#13;
                    ed.   If they were not, I would think that when this legislation is enacted,&#13;
&#13;
                    they would try immediately to bW some of our bonds.        I feel sure they 'Will,&#13;
&#13;
                    to the extent of any surplus funds they have, try to buy some at this time.&#13;
&#13;
                    They will find it rather difficult to buy them, and if they try to buy ver:r&#13;
&#13;
                    lDEI.Dl' they will probably make the market go up.   I 'WOuld imagine that the&#13;
&#13;
