&amp;#12;&#13;
A.    BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMIENTS&#13;
1.    Repeated conflicts and their aftermaths. The Republic of Congo is emerging from a&#13;
war with three rounds of violent conflicts between 1993 and 1999. At the height of the crisis in&#13;
late 1999, approximately one-third of the Congolese population was displaced. Poverty, in both&#13;
absolute and relative terms, is widespread. In 1994, unemployment was estimated to be close to&#13;
50 percent and remains at this level. Before the first civil war in 1993, an estimated 30 percent&#13;
of the population of Brazzaville, which is generally better off than the rural population, lived on&#13;
less than one UJS dollar a day. After three civil wars, the situation has deteriorated substantially&#13;
in both urban and rural areas. After the recent conflict in 1999, approximately 70 percent of the&#13;
population is estimated to be living below the poverty line. Per capita Gross National Product&#13;
(GNP) in 1999 was estimated at US$670; while relatively high in comparison to most Sub-&#13;
Saharan African countries, it disguised a highly skewed income distribution. For the majority of&#13;
the Congolese population, the combined effects of civil war and neglect have been disastrous.&#13;
2.    The Bank prepared a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for the Republic of Congo to&#13;
guide operations over the coming two years. The TSS was discussed by the Board on January&#13;
16, 2001. The principal objective of the TSS is to support the Government by using a five-&#13;
pronged approach: (i) strengthening economic stability and equitable growth and supporting&#13;
reforms; (ii) reestablishing basic economic and social services; (iii) building capacity of&#13;
government and civil society; (iv) fighting the growing threat of HIV/kIDS; and (v) providing&#13;
assistance to war-affected and vulnerable population groups.&#13;
B.    IMPACT OF THE CONFLICT&#13;
3.    Humanitarian plight.   Whereas the wars of 1993/94 were essentially limited to&#13;
Brazzaville, the 1997 and 1998/99 wars brought large-scale destruction to southern areas of the&#13;
Republic of Congo, with the exception of the area around Pointe-Noire. This war created a&#13;
humanitarian catastrophe with about 300,000 Brazzaville residents, representing almost 35&#13;
percent of the city's population, fleeing the capital and seeking refuge in forests where they lived&#13;
under very difficult conditions for almost one year. At the height of the humanitarian crisis (in&#13;
late 1999), an estimated 800,000 people, or almost one-third of the population of the Republic of&#13;
Congo were displaced.  Thirty thousand of ithese either sought refuge in Gabon or the&#13;
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Severity percent of those internally displaced were&#13;
malnourished. Many lost all their belongings and suffered great physical and psychological&#13;
hardships. The country was pillaged, (e.g., iron sheets were stolen from churches and houses,&#13;
farms were burned, and health centers, schools and public buildings were looted). With the&#13;
return of most displaced people, needs have shifted away from emergency humanitarian&#13;
interventions toward social reintegration, infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction.&#13;
4.    Economic Impact. The preliminary estimate of damage inflicted by the last two civil&#13;
wars is approximately US$2.6 billion, well exceeding the size of the 1999 Gross Domestic&#13;
Product (GDP). Non-oil GDP, a better indicator in assessing the impact of the war on domestic&#13;
productive capacity (as oil is produced essentially offshore), declined by 19 percent between&#13;
1996 and 1999. By the time of the outbreak of the 1997 civil war, the Republic of Congo's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
economy had already been weakened by years of poor economic management and governance&#13;
and by the bloody conflict of 1993/1994 and the resulting social unrest. It is estimated that 50&#13;
percent of agricultural tools were destroyed and 75 percent of livestock lost. Many archives&#13;
were either destroyed or looted. The banking sector was strongly affected and commercial banks&#13;
came out of the events insolvent and illiquid. Most deposits were de facto frozen and banks had&#13;
no resources to contribute to rebuilding economic activity.&#13;
5.    Macroeconomic Developments. Since independence, in 1960, the Republic of Congo&#13;
has experienced ethnic strife, civil wars, institutional instability and poor governance. This has&#13;
brought economic decline and the country's economic performance is well below its potential&#13;
because of three decades of poor economic management, which was designed under a Marxist-&#13;
oriented, single-party government. The GDP per capita declined by more than half, from&#13;
US$1,300 in 1982 to US$630 in 2000. The GDP growth has been erratic; declining by 2.4&#13;
percent in 1997, rebounding by 3.7 percent in 1998, then again declining by 3.2 percent in 1999.&#13;
After the 1999 cease-fire accord and successful implementation of the peace process, the GDP&#13;
grew to 7.6 percent. Due to relatively higher oil prices, the fiscal balance moved from a deficit&#13;
(-20 percent of GDP in 1998 and -6.2 percent in 1999) to a surplus in 2000 (1.2 percent of GDP)&#13;
for the first time in several years.&#13;
6.    The Government has taken emergency measures to boost the economy, including&#13;
investing in post-war reconstruction efforts and resuming rail transportation service between&#13;
Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville. As a result of these emergency measures, productive activities&#13;
have resumed and annual inflation levels have remained marginal.&#13;
7.    Social Indicators. Some social indicators have consistently declined over the years (but&#13;
are no worse than indicators of other Sub-Saharan African countries). Gross primary school&#13;
enrollment rates dropped from 125.2 percent in 1987 to 78.6 percent in 1998, while gross&#13;
secondary enrollment rates dropped from about 70 percent in the early 1980s to 35.7 percent in&#13;
1998. As a result, literacy rates have also dropped from about 65 percent in the mid 1980s to&#13;
59.5 percent in 1998. The scarcity of qualified teachers, high student-teacher ratio, low-quality&#13;
education and grade repeat-rates have been identified as the main weaknesses of the school&#13;
system. The student-teacher ratio in Brazzaville is 80, compared to the established threshold of&#13;
60, which is the consequence of the limited number of classrooms and teachers. Twenty-eight&#13;
school facilities have been rehabilitated, but 325 classrooms need to be rehabilitated or&#13;
constructed. According to the Ministry of Education, 915 teachers in Brazzaville, representing&#13;
40 percent of all teachers in the city, are holding administrative positions instead of teaching.&#13;
Parent-Teacher associations are very active in financing the maintenance of school facilities,&#13;
including latrines, water points and electricity.&#13;
8.    Most health indicators are still above the average of Sub-Saharan African standards&#13;
because the country has enjoyed a higher GDP per capita than many countries on the African&#13;
continent. Infant mortality is 81 per thousand, compared to an average of 106 per thousand&#13;
elsewhere. Nevertheless, health services have declined steadily. Infant vaccination rates for&#13;
measles have dropped from 99.4 percent in 1979 to 58 percent in 1999. Incidences of&#13;
tuberculosis have almost quadrupled, from 32 per 100,000 in 1985 to 113 per 100,000 in 1999.&#13;
IV/AIDS has become an increasing threat to the country's development outlook although sero&#13;
prevalence in the general population is estimated at 7 percent. This figure is certainly&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
underestimated, considering the total destruction of pre-war database, the poor reliability of the&#13;
present database, and the lack of comprehensive epidemiological studies. A recent survey,&#13;
conducted by the Ministry of Health, showed that 14.9 percent of pregnant women are infected&#13;
with HIV/AIDS in Pointe-Noire and 5.5 percent in Brazzaville. Combined HIV/AIDS spread,&#13;
violent deaths (due to repeated conflicts) and worsening health services have reduced life&#13;
expectancy from 53 years in 1993 to 48.6 years in 1999. Life expectancy at birth in the Republic&#13;
of Congo is now very close to the average in Sub-Sahara Africa, which contrasts with statistics&#13;
of two decades ago when the country was among leading African countries in terms of longer&#13;
life expectancy.&#13;
9.    Institutional and Capacity Impact. The civil unrest and insecurity created by the&#13;
conflicts have severely weakened Congo's institutional and human capacities. Disruption of the&#13;
country's administrative capacity and institutional memory has been severe, with loss of&#13;
manpower (particularly qualified staff), records, and Information Technology (IT) equipment for&#13;
most institutions. Many professionals either left the country or were killed, thus leaving a&#13;
vacuum in critical areas of service delivery, planning and management. Most public offices were&#13;
burned down, destroyed, vandalized or pillaged in eight of the country's I I regions.&#13;
Government vehicles were stolen as well as vehicles belonging to individuals and private&#13;
institutions.&#13;
10.   Road Infrastructure: The existing road network is in a poor state. The road network is&#13;
composed of 1,875 km of national roads (11 percent), 3,574 km of secondary roads (21 percent),&#13;
and 9,310 km of tertiary roads (53 percent). Only 7 percent of the country's road network is&#13;
paved and paved stretches are scattered. Many regional capitals do not have reliable access&#13;
roads. National and secondary roads are in disrepair as a result of years of insufficient&#13;
maintenance aggravated by years of war. Secondary and agricultural feeder roads were already&#13;
impassable before the war as maintenance was neglected during peacetime. The situation&#13;
worsened during war times as bridges were destroyed for strategic reasons. Maintenance of roads&#13;
was no more a priority and could not take place for security reasons and lack of funding since&#13;
financial resources were diverted for military purposes and staff left their positions and hid in&#13;
secluded areas. Existing equipment was looted and archives and technical documents were&#13;
destroyed. It is not rare to spend over seven hours on an 80 km national road because of its state.&#13;
Inaccessibility to the interior is due to lack of roads that strangles the rural sector and agriculture.&#13;
The resulting high transport costs contribute to both rural and urban food insecurity. While roads&#13;
crumble, reports of rotting food have been received. Many agricultural zones are inaccessible&#13;
and their inhabitants remain isolated, thus making it impossible for them to market their produce&#13;
'and obtain necessary technical assistance to augment their agricultural production.&#13;
11.   The urban road network in Brazzaville is estimated to include 200 km of asphalted roads&#13;
and 530 km of dirt roads, according to information provided by the technical services of the City&#13;
of Brazzaville. Asphalted roads are limited to the main roads, and the share of asphalted roads in&#13;
comparison to the size of the city is quite limited. Seventy percent of asphalted roads are&#13;
considered to be in a severe state of degradation and will need immediate and massive&#13;
rehabilitation. Paved roads will be lost forever if rehabilitation does not take place in the near&#13;
future. Many neighborhoods are inaccessible and public transportation is no more available in&#13;
those areas and the population has to walk over long distances to reach their houses.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12.   Railway infrastructure. Adequate transport between the seaport of Pointe-Noire and&#13;
Brazzaville is critical for the Republic of Congo's economy, as well as for land-locked Central&#13;
African Republic and Chad. The railway line between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville is presently,&#13;
and will remain in coming years, the only high capacity, all weather, transport mode on this&#13;
route. Railway infrastructure and service facilities were damaged during the civil war. The&#13;
railway line between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville, the econornic umbilical cord of the country,&#13;
was destroyed at several points. Rail and road traffic were interrupted in September 1996 and&#13;
resumed only in July 2000, after reconstruction of bridges destroyed during the war. At present,&#13;
transport capacity is severely constrained by inadequate locomotive power, and train movement&#13;
safety is at risk due to a poor telecommunication system and damaged railway tracks in some&#13;
areas of a major tunnel. Accidents on the railway line, apart from the human toll, had dramatic&#13;
impacts on the economy. After the last derailment of October 2001, the city of Brazzaville&#13;
almost completely stopped functioning as the supply of gasoline was interrupted for two days.&#13;
Cab drivers had to wait at gas stations all night so as to ensure the purchase of fuel in the&#13;
morning and car queues at gas stations reached 300 to 400 meters.&#13;
13.   Drainage. Brazzaville is traversed by many perennial streams, such as Djiri, Kelekele,&#13;
Mikalu, Tsieme, M'Foa, M'Filou and Djoue all flowing into the Congo River. The primary&#13;
drainage system is principally made up of gutters, drains and streams that join the Congo River,&#13;
which flows from east to west. This drainage system, built during the colonial period, has&#13;
severely degraded, partly because of the wars and partly because of the lack of appropriate&#13;
maintenance, which can also be attributed to the war situation. This system, according to the&#13;
technical services of the City of Brazzaville, comprises about 410 kilometers of secondary drains&#13;
and 10 kilometers of primary drains. The drainage network is unevenly distributed in&#13;
Brazzaville and older sections of the city barely have basic drainage infrastructure. The little that&#13;
exists is mainly concentrated in primary roads, and most secondary road networks are not&#13;
drained. The primary drainage system and streams are hampered by a high level of silt and&#13;
rapidly growing aquatic plants, which result in frequent flooding during heavy rainfalls. In&#13;
addition, the limited hydraulic capacity of the drains and increased soil impermeability has led to&#13;
frequent flooding of the busiest sections of the city.&#13;
14.   Due to the lack of sufficient drainage facilities and the poor quality of soils in areas with&#13;
high slopes, most of the southern districts of the city experienced severe soil erosion that has&#13;
destroyed many houses in recent years. Erosion represents a large threat to buildings, roads and&#13;
the water distribution network.&#13;
15.   Water. In Congo, having reliable access to water depends largely upon whether you live&#13;
in an urban or rural area. The high urbanization rate favored public financing of water to urban&#13;
centers. Water is delivered to urban centers by Soci6te Nationale de Distribution d'Eau (SNDE),&#13;
which is a national public corporation. Thirty six percent of the population is connected to the&#13;
water supply network, while the remaining population relies on water sold by neighboring&#13;
households connected to the network, or from other unsafe water sources. Access to water&#13;
services was estimated to be around 50 percent in urban areas in 1998. Recent figures showed&#13;
that only 11 percent of the rural population has access to adequate water supply and most of the&#13;
population relies on water of dubious quality from streams and rivers. Despite favorable&#13;
hydrological conditions (with many high flows, perennial rivers and streams), only 46 percent of&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the country's population has access to reliable quality water. This figure is below the average&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa standard of 55 percent.&#13;
16.   Sanitation. In 1996, a survey conducted in Brazzaville by the Ministry of Health found&#13;
that 15 percent of households had septic tanks, 23 percent had water closets, 42 percent had&#13;
traditional latrines, and 15 percent did not have toilet facilities and used neighbors' or nearby&#13;
clearings as toilets. Brazzaville has only three solid waste collection trucks, even though the&#13;
need is three to four times greater; therefore, available waste collection trucks cannot meet the&#13;
demand. This has resulted in poor solid waste collection with large quantities of domestic waste&#13;
being dumped into ditches, thus blocking streams and drains and further complicating the&#13;
drainage issue. Inappropriate excreta and sludge removal arrangements, as well as discharge of&#13;
wastewater in open spaces and drains compound this situation. Also, inappropriate disposal of&#13;
sewage and wastewater leads to pools of polluted water, which conveys hydro fecal related&#13;
diseases and provides breeding grounds for mosquitoes, especially in densely populated&#13;
neighborhoods, such as Poto Poto, Ouenze, Moungali and Talangai.&#13;
C.    GOVERNMENT RESPONSE&#13;
17.   In response to the crisis, the Government has prepared, in a participatory way with&#13;
representatives from the local NGO community, a three-year Interim Post-Conflict Program&#13;
("Programme Interimaire Post-Conflit") for the period 2000-02, which aims at helping the&#13;
Republic of Congo move from a humanitarian crisis to a sustainable economic and social&#13;
development, and from a state-dominated to a market-based economy. Sectoral strategies were&#13;
prepared for basic sectors (energy, road and railway infrastructure, telecommunications); support&#13;
sectors (agriculture and livestock, forestry, petroleum, tourism, environnment and mines); social&#13;
sectors (health, water, sanitation and drainage, education, youth, shelter); and the private sector&#13;
(small- and medium-scale enterprises, trade, handicraft, informal economy).  The donor&#13;
community reviewed the proposed program, for which the Government seeks donor support,&#13;
during a multi-donor mission to Brazzaville in April 2000. The program has two major elements:&#13;
emergency and growth.&#13;
18.   Emergency. With the signing of agreements with key military commanders of the main&#13;
fighting groups to cease fire and end hostilities, the security situation has improved significantly&#13;
in Brazzaville and throughout the entire country. The devastation of the economy and&#13;
infrastructure assets is huge. Restoring the economy and rebuilding the dilapidated infrastructure&#13;
are enormous challenges for the Government, while public finances are still in a weak condition.&#13;
Rebuilding infrastructure, bringing the administration and its staff back and rebuilding their&#13;
capacity, paying the salaries of civil servants, increasing public revenues, creating job&#13;
opportunities for unemployed youth, demobi]lizing and reinserting former militiamen,&#13;
strengthening the economy and coordinating with donors are all priority actions facing the&#13;
Government. Support from donors has been very limited and concentrated on humanitarian&#13;
needs, leaving almost all the burden of rehabilitating the infrastructure and rebuilding the&#13;
economy to the Government. One of the main issues faced by the Government is defining its&#13;
priorities and drawing support, on a coordinated basis, from its external partners. The&#13;
Government seeks to improve access to the country's interior and provide basic road&#13;
infrastructure, health, education, and improve sanitary conditions for the urban population. It&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
aims at ensuring the free circulation of persons and transfer of goods through improved&#13;
Government maintained security, effective road infrastructure and resumption of railway service&#13;
between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville, which is vital for jump-starting economic activities in&#13;
Brazzaville and the country. Rehabilitation of dilapidated roads in Brazzaville and rural areas is&#13;
a key objective, as is the demobilization and reintegration of ex-militias in an impartial, equitable&#13;
and balanced manner, and providing short-term employment to demobilized combatants and&#13;
youths. In order to improve food security, the relaunching of agricultural and livestock&#13;
activities, including agro-industry, is another priority.&#13;
19.   Growth. The relaunching of the productive sector is an essential component toward&#13;
poverty reduction and econornic and sustainable development. Support to the private sector and&#13;
diversification of the economy are central elements thereof, fighting unemployment another. The&#13;
program includes efforts aimed at increasing competitiveness through, among others, progressive&#13;
elimination of non-tariff barriers and modernization of the labor law. The Government further&#13;
intends to deepen subregional integration, through improvements in the transport infrastructure,&#13;
which will stimulate the exchange of goods and services. Reinforcement of administrative and&#13;
institutional capacities of the State and strengthening the rule of law are considered important&#13;
elements to overcoming dysfunctional economic and financial management processes.&#13;
20.   Rehabilitation activities performed. The Government has financed (out of its own&#13;
modest resources) quite a large capital investment program to rehabilitate the railway line&#13;
between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville (mostly the bridges). Railway traffic, which stopped for&#13;
more than a year following the 1999 war, resumed in August 2000. After the recent war, some&#13;
of the water production capacity and distribution system have been reestablished in Brazzaville.&#13;
The Government, supported by different NGOs and with its own resources, has reestablished&#13;
water production and distribution by rehabilitating some electric transformers to run treatment&#13;
plants and boreholes, and has purchased limited chemical products for water treatment. The&#13;
Government has also financed partial rehabilitation of devastated office buildings and equipment&#13;
in order to resume activities in the administration. Many schools and health centers were&#13;
rehabilitated in Brazzaville and in rural areas. The Government has embarked on a limited road&#13;
rehabilitation program in Brazzaville aimed at easing transportation in the capital city. Main&#13;
electricity production centers and their supporting infrastructure were rehabilitated, but are still&#13;
inadequate in coping with demand. Even with those efforts, a lot remains to be done to bring&#13;
infrastructure services back to pre-war level. Growing demand from inhabitants and resumption&#13;
of economic activities are far from being satisfied. Significant financial resources will be needed&#13;
to rebuild destroyed and dilapidated infrastructure and donors' resources, as well as private&#13;
sector financing will be required to complement the Government's limited financial means.&#13;
21.   Structural reforms, Governance and Transparency. To lay the foundation for higher&#13;
and sustainable growth in years to come and under a market-based economy, Congolese&#13;
authorities have engaged in full-fledged privatization efforts of the three commercial banks, key&#13;
public utilities (water, electricity and telecommunications), railway operations and oil products&#13;
distribution. The government is currently pursuing options to privatize the railway through a&#13;
concession, and has recruited a consulting firm to provide support to the Privatization&#13;
Committee. A comprehensive rehabilitation program for infrastructure and equipment will be&#13;
implemented as part of the concession and according to the bidding documents.  The&#13;
concessionaire, who will also be responsible for putting together the needed funds, will design&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
this program in order to meet its performance obligations spelled out in the concession contract&#13;
to be signed between the operator and the Republic of Congo. However, the benefits of this&#13;
program are not expected to materialize before 2005. Bids for the selection of operators and&#13;
concessionaires have been sent out. Related investments to increase capacity and manage the&#13;
sectors will be left to the private sector. The Government is also engaged in improving&#13;
governance and increasing transparency, by strengthening the overall budget performance and&#13;
tracking the use of revenues generated by the oil sector. A framework agreement, clarifying the&#13;
financial relationships between Societe Nationale des Petroles du Congo (SNPC) and the State&#13;
(oil revenues represented 78 percent of Government revenues in 2000), was signed on June 29,&#13;
2001. Other actions the Government will carry out include regular audits of SNPC, public funds&#13;
managed by public institutions, logging permits, and review of the national procurement code.&#13;
D.    INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE&#13;
22.   Donors have shown support to the Republic of Congo's Government in its rehabilitation,&#13;
recovery, peace and national reconciliation process. In this context, UNDP and UN OCHA&#13;
organized a humanitarian donors' meeting and consolidated appeal in Geneva in July 2001.&#13;
Eleven UN agencies are in the country and actively involved in various areas, e.g., revival of&#13;
productive activities, emergency needs, reestablishing basic social services and infrastructure,&#13;
and promoting democracy and human rights. UNDP launched an Arms Collecting and&#13;
Reintegration Program, under the implementation of IOM and financed by a Post Conflict Grant&#13;
provided by the World Bank. After six months of operation, this program has reintegrated 3,400&#13;
ex-combatants. UNDP and IOM aim at reaching about 12,000 more ex-combatants within the&#13;
next 12 months when the program ends. France, the United States, and Italy, are actively&#13;
involved in diverse social and humanitarian activities. Resources of the 6t, 7th and 8th European&#13;
funds are still available, and the European Union (EU) has allocated 43 million Euros to the&#13;
country under the 8th European Fund. AfDB is maintaining dialogue with the Republic of Congo&#13;
while at the same time reviewing its reengagement strategy in the country with respect to the&#13;
clearance of arrears due to this institution.&#13;
23.   Response on the Infrastructure Sectors. The EU has been very active in the country&#13;
since the end of the last conflict. It has financed US$5 million in urban and rural infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitation projects, urban sanitation and solid waste management activities. The EU is&#13;
financing feasibility and detailed technical studies for the reconstruction of the road between&#13;
Brazzaville, Kinkala and Matoumbou, and intends to finance the construction of this road. The&#13;
EU has already financed rehabilitation of the Avenue de la Tsieme and the Ceinture maraichaire&#13;
in Brazzaville, the road between Kinkala and Boko and the cleaning of drainage facilities in&#13;
Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire by using remaining funds from previous aid packages not fully&#13;
disbursed. The EU approved the 8th European Development Fund package of 43 million Euros&#13;
to the Government on May 17, 2001. The bulk of this aid package (66 percent) will finance&#13;
construction of the road between Brazzaville and Kinkala, about 250 km rural roads&#13;
rehabilitation works in the northern, central and southern areas of the country and the national&#13;
transportation plan. The EU may also finance construction of the connection road between the&#13;
southern exit of the city of Brazzaville and the hinterland. The 9th European Development Fund,&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a total amount of 117 million Euros, is being discussed and will be used to finance roads in&#13;
addition to support democracy, human rights and state of law.&#13;
24.   The French Development Agency had intended to finance different projects; these&#13;
include rehabilitation of the roads connecting Kinkala to Loutete; an Urban Rehabilitation&#13;
project for Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire, including drainage and road rehabilitation works and&#13;
municipal capacity building for US$18 million; and an employment and reinsertion project in the&#13;
same cities, including a labor-intensive works component for US$5 million. Detailed design&#13;
studies for the Urban Rehabilitation project and preliminary studies for the Employment and&#13;
Reinsertion Project have been prepared and are available. These projects cannot be implemented&#13;
because the Republic of Congo is in a non-accrual status regarding its debt arrears with AFD.&#13;
The agency is financing studies to define rehabilitation works to be carried out on the Port of&#13;
Pointe-Noire, and the privatization scheme for the Port of Brazzaville and secondary ports with&#13;
remaining funds from previous structural adjustment programs. In the meantime, AFD financed,&#13;
on an account sharing arrangement with IDA, feasibility and preliminary studies on roads,&#13;
drainage works and capacity building activities. These studies are available and have been used&#13;
to define and cost components of the proposed project.&#13;
25.   The French Ministry of Cooperation has been active in the country since 1999 and&#13;
support programs related to school rehabilitation, teacher training and health sector technical&#13;
assistance. The French ministry is preparing a new assistance program aimed at strengthening&#13;
Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire municipalities.&#13;
26.   In 1998, the African Development Bank prepared a US$10 million emergency recovery&#13;
credit, with particular focus on infrastructure rehabilitation, aimed at improving drainage and&#13;
roads in Poto Poto and Ouenze districts in Brazzaville while using, whenever possible, labor-&#13;
intensive methods, rehabilitation of school facilities, microfinance and capacity building&#13;
activities. AfDB could not continue this operation because the Republic of Congo has not cleared&#13;
its arrears with AfDB.&#13;
E. IDA RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
I.    Elements of IDA Response&#13;
27.   The proposed Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation  and Living  Conditions&#13;
Improvement Project is an integral part of the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy and will&#13;
address unemployment issues through labor-intensive projects, infrastructure rehabilitation to&#13;
assist the Republic of Congo in the transition from war to sustainable peace, and the resumption&#13;
of economic and social development. The TSS guides the Bank's engagement over the next 24-&#13;
months in support of the Government's Interim Post Conflict Program, in areas where the Bank&#13;
has a clear comparative advantage. The principal objective of the Bank's TSS is to support the&#13;
Government in facing the four simultaneous challenges of consolidating its home-grown peace&#13;
process: laying and solidifying the foundation for the democratization of political life, physically&#13;
reconstructing the country, improving economic management through increased transparency&#13;
and good governance in public resource management. Achievement of this objective will be&#13;
based on:&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a) Strengthening economic stability and equitable growth and supporting reforms to&#13;
facilitate the transition to a market-based economy; this would be closely linked&#13;
with the IMF program;&#13;
b) Reestablishing basic economic and social services, including rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of small- and large-scale infrastructure;&#13;
c) Building capacity of government and civil society so as to help the Republic of&#13;
Congo face the challenges of designing and implementing effective programs,&#13;
improve governance, and undertake public transactions transparently;&#13;
d) Fighting the growing threat of HIV/AIDS; and&#13;
e) Providing assistance to war-affected and vulnerable population groups.&#13;
28.   There are five projects being prepared under the strategy. The proposed project is the&#13;
fourth operation of the TSS. It would respond to the emergency of reestablishing basic economic&#13;
and social services, rehabilitating and maintaining small- and large-scale social infrastructures to&#13;
help jump-start the economy. This will be achieved by rehabilitating the railways infrastructure,&#13;
improving sanitary conditions in the Brazzaville neighborhoods, facilitating transportation in&#13;
Brazzaville while reestablishing connections between the rural areas and the cities, and providing&#13;
job opportunities for the urban youth.&#13;
29.   Other operations under the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy include: (i) a US$37.5&#13;
million Post Conflict ERC, approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on July 31, 2001,&#13;
following the implementation of structural reforms to strengthen economic stability, expand the&#13;
private sector's role by privatizing all commercial banks, forestry companies, key public utilities&#13;
and increase transparency in the use of oil revenues; (ii) a US$5 million Emergency&#13;
Demobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration Credit (Cr 3561 COB), approved on July 31,&#13;
2001, aimed at providing sound post-conflict reintegration options to currently unemployed ex-&#13;
combatants and rehabilitating physical and social infrastructures in their original communities;&#13;
(iii) a US$7 rnillion Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project, approved on&#13;
February 7, 2002, to accompany reforms envisaged under the Post-Conflict Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation Credit (Post Conflict ERC), and to enhance transparency of decision making in&#13;
the oil and gas sectors, in public finance, particularly the Ministry of Economy, Finance and&#13;
Budget (MoFFB), and in government's disengagement from the productive sectors of the&#13;
economy, focusing on the privatization program; and (iv) an HIV/AIDS project to address the&#13;
growing threat of AIDS.&#13;
30.   The Bank is also in the process of engaging in non-lending activities. These activities will&#13;
include public expenditure reviews, a social assessment, a labor market analysis and studies on&#13;
natural resources management. The public expenditure reviews will aim at rationalizing&#13;
revenues and expenditures and make the budgetary process and management of public resources&#13;
more transparent and more effective to the country's development objectives. Given the huge&#13;
unemployment situation facing the country, a better knowledge of the labor market is key to&#13;
developing strategies and approaches to facilitate and increase employment opportunities. The&#13;
Bank has, through a US$1 million Post-Conflict grant and a US$0.5 million Institutional&#13;
Development Grant, supported activities related to promotion of youth and women, and studies&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
aimed at defining an enabling environment for private sector participation in the&#13;
telecommunications sector.&#13;
II.   Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
31.     The proposed Emergency Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Living Conditions&#13;
Improvement Project will help address the country's immediate rehabilitation needs. The&#13;
rebuilding of basic and social infrastructure, using labor-intensive methods, will help create jobs.&#13;
The Bank chaired the Donors' consultation, held in Paris in October 2000, and was asked to lead&#13;
the donor community by providing a framework for mobilizing donor resources, strengthening&#13;
the Government's aid coordination capacity and sharing its post-conflict experience. During the&#13;
Paris meeting, it was stressed that support from the international community may help avert the&#13;
creation of a lost generation of uneducated youth with a bleak future, who could be a danger to&#13;
the society in the future as the social systems further fall into disarray. Finally, the Bank has also&#13;
developed valuable experience in implementing labor-intensive public works.&#13;
III.  Lessons Learned&#13;
32.   Previous and current Bank operations on emergency reconstruction in post-conflict&#13;
countries (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda, Bosnia-Herzegovina) have provided us with&#13;
valuable lessons, which have been included in the design of this project. One lesson is to&#13;
establish dialogue on a wide range of technical issues, implementation arrangements and&#13;
management decisions. This has been achieved by assessing the potential for saving by using&#13;
local materials. The Government has agreed to include local materials for the construction of&#13;
tertiary roads and drainage networks and to use labor-intensive methods for infrastructure works.&#13;
The municipality of Brazzaville has also agreed to move away from its traditional approach and&#13;
to contract out operation and maintenance of urban roads and drainage facilities to the local&#13;
private sector and earmark appropriate funds for maintenance purposes.&#13;
33.   Another lesson is that implementation arrangements should be kept simple to&#13;
accommodate limited capacity and avoid unrealistic expectations because the process of&#13;
rehabilitation is lengthy and complex. Including too many components and too many activities in&#13;
such a project can create excessive complexity that can be detrimental to project objectives. Even&#13;
if the project is relatively large, project interventions are limited in comparison to the needs&#13;
identified in the Government Emergency Reconstruction Program presented to the donor&#13;
community. Activities related to water supply, electricity and telecommunications, which are&#13;
very important, are not part of the project. Even if commitment is high, and when capacity is&#13;
low, (which is normally the case in post-conflict situation), project designs should remain&#13;
relatively simple while additional capacity should be ensured through continued technical&#13;
assistance and training of project staff. Even if the number of stakeholders involved in the project&#13;
is quite important, implementation will lie with only one unit.&#13;
34.   A third lesson is that procurement and disbursement procedures should be kept in line&#13;
with the post-conflict context. In order to speed up disbursement, streamlined and expeditious&#13;
procurement arrangements should be used to avoid late delivery of goods and commissioning of&#13;
work. The project has embraced this lesson and procurement procedures under the project will&#13;
not follow national regulations, which are known to be cumbersome, unclear and lengthy.&#13;
Contract signing responsibilities have been limited to the project coordinator.&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35.   The fourth lesson is that Government ownership is essential to reduce blockage and&#13;
opposition from vested interests and accept the "bypassing" of existing procedures to consider&#13;
the project as a first step on which to build future collaboration between the Government and the&#13;
Bank. Those lessons have been incorporated in the design of the project. The Government has&#13;
agreed to give full implementation responsibility to the PIU to run the project.&#13;
F.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
I.    Project Objective&#13;
36.   The objective of the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Living Conditions&#13;
Improvement Project is to contribute to reestablishment of basic economic activities and social&#13;
services by rehabilitating primary, secondary and urban roads, railways, drainage, and school&#13;
facilities.&#13;
37.   This will be the basis for long-term reconstruction and economic recovery. Particular&#13;
attention will be paid to long-term sustainability, so that actions taken during the emergency&#13;
situation do not have long-term adverse consequences on institutions and programs.&#13;
II.   Project Costing and Financing&#13;
38.   The Project includes five major components: (i) primary and secondary infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitation; (ii) employment generation; (iii) railway rehabilitation; (iv) HIV/AIDS&#13;
sensitization; and (v) institutional strengthening and capacity building.&#13;
39.   The project is a first attempt to tackle part of the larger reconstruction and rehabilitation&#13;
of infrastructure needs of the country that cannot be solved under an emergency operation. The&#13;
urban water, telecommunication and electricity sectors, which are more prone to private sector&#13;
participation, are not addressed under this project as the Government is engaged in a process of&#13;
developing public-private partnerships in the above-mentioned sectors. Private operators will be&#13;
responsible for financing rehabilitation works and investments related to additional capacity to&#13;
meet actual and future demands in those sectors. AFD and the Bank are actually supporting the&#13;
Government in securing private sector participation on those sectors. Future Bank operations,&#13;
participation of other donors and financing from Government will address remaining&#13;
reconstruction needs and works related to expansion of infrastructure services in the future.&#13;
40.     Project Costing: The total cost for the proposed project has been estimated at US$40&#13;
million. Details can be found in Annex I.&#13;

Aid Coordination&#13;
41.   In spite of the country's arrears situation with AFD, AfDB and OPEC Fund, they have&#13;
indicated their willingness to support the Government's rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts.&#13;
Previous contributions from donors have been organized through the Ministry of Public Works&#13;
and Equipment, and this Ministry handles most road rehabilitation programs. The capacity&#13;
building component will complement efforts already in place or in the process of being&#13;
implemented by the French Ministry of Cooperation (Cooperation fran,aise). Feasibility and&#13;
preliminary design studies of some urban roads and drainage facilities in Brazzaville, included in&#13;
the proposed project, have been financed by AFD. Discussions are underway among the&#13;
Government, AFD, AfDB and OPEC Fund for developing programs and projects that can be&#13;
supported with new resources to be provided by these donors. At the same time, the Bank keeps&#13;
informing these important partners on progress made during project preparation and will&#13;
continue to keep them informed during project implementation.&#13;
III.  Detailed Project Description&#13;
42.   Component 1 - Primary and Secondary Infrastructure Rehabilitation: This component&#13;
will finance:&#13;
(i)   Reconstruction of 190 km of roads in the primary inter-urban road network&#13;
damaged during the conflict in the Pool, Bouenza and Plateaux regions; and&#13;
(ii)  Rehabilitation of 15 km of badly damaged primary roads in the city of&#13;
Brazzaville.&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43.   Component 2 - Employment Generation: This component will help create temporary&#13;
employment and, in the process, develop skills to help provide income to unemployed youths&#13;
and demobilized combatants, thereby helping to stabilize the peace process. This component&#13;
will finance the following activities:&#13;
- Social and Environmental Infrastructure: (a) Rehabilitate 124 classrooms in&#13;
13 primary schools in Brazzaville and provide needed equipment; and (b)&#13;
construct 7 km of tertiary drainage facilities in Brazzaville (Moungali and&#13;
Makelekele districts);&#13;
- Infrastructure to prevent further damage: Protect 12,000 m2 of eroded sites in&#13;
the Makelekele district in Brazzaville to prevent further collapse of roads, houses,&#13;
water lines that can seriously disrupt public and economic activities; and&#13;
- Transport Infrastructure: (a) Rehabilitate 290 km of rural roads from rural&#13;
agricultural producing areas to secondary urban centers in the Pool, Bouenza, and&#13;
Plateaux regions; and (b) construct 9.5 km of tertiary paved roads in Brazzaville.&#13;
44.   Component 3 - Railway Rehabilitation: Emergency railway rehabilitation, limited in&#13;
scope, is aimed at improving (in the short-term) the transport capacity of this critical railway&#13;
line, as well as the safety of train movements. The main activities to be financed under the&#13;
emergency railway rehabilitation component are the following:&#13;
(i) Reinforcing the radio-telecommunication network between stations and trains;&#13;
(ii) Strengthening locomotive power capacity through spare parts acquisition (for&#13;
rehabilitation of existing but presently not running locomotives);&#13;
(iii) Acquiring railway materials (rails, sleepers, fastenings) for emergency track&#13;
repairs (after derailments), and spare parts for track maintenance equipment&#13;
(lorries, tamping machine);&#13;
(iv) Improving security conditions in the Mayombe tunnel (lighting, ventilation,&#13;
track repair.); and&#13;
(v) Acquiring essential spare parts for freight wagons and passenger coaches.&#13;
45.   Component 4 - HIV Sensitization: This component will support the fight against the&#13;
spread of HIV/AIDS by complementing existing programs and assist local NGOs working on&#13;
HIV/AIDS sensitization. This component will also support the strengthening of the ability of the&#13;
Municipality of Brazzaville to focus on HIV/AIDS sensitization. Work programs to be funded by&#13;
this component have been agreed upon with the NPHIV/AIDS (the executing agency of the&#13;
National Strategy against HIV/AIDS) and will closely follow the national strategy for HIV/AIDS&#13;
prevention. Activities to be funded include (i) general sensitization programs at the national&#13;
level, to local authorities in Brazzaville and in rural areas, specific sensitization activities on&#13;
work sites, primary and high schools, condom distribution, treatment of sexually transmitted&#13;
diseases of infected workers and sexual workers on work sites and areas surrounding works sites&#13;
in Brazzaville, along rehabilitated rural roads and railway line; (ii) construction of two diagnostic&#13;
centers in two districts in Brazzaville, with appropriate equipment for testing for the virus,&#13;
chemicals and supplies; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46.   Component 5 - Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building: This component aims&#13;
at giving limited institutional support to certain ministries and municipalities by providing&#13;
technical assistance and training.  It will finance restoration and upgrading of destroyed&#13;
equipment and databases to ensure that rehabilitated infrastructure and services are being&#13;
properly managed and maintained. It will also finance communication and information activities&#13;
related to the project and develop community awareness about the project on how the population&#13;
can participate in the maintenance of future rehabilitated roads, drainage and school facilities.&#13;
Consistent with that approach, the project will finance the following activities:&#13;
In the Ministry of Public Works and Equipment&#13;
(a) Computerization of the Project Implementation Unit and units in charge of&#13;
planning and maintaining primary and rural roads and develop appropriate&#13;
procedures to contract out maintenance activities to the private sector and monitor&#13;
performance;&#13;
(b) Development of a MIS to monitor employment creation in labor intensive public&#13;
works and track project implementation progress;&#13;
(c) Computerization and updating of the road database and development of&#13;
procedures to update the database on a continuous and systematic basis; and&#13;
(d) Training staff from the Ministry of Public Works in maintenance planning,&#13;
monitoring and procurement of maintenance activities and in administration of&#13;
labor-intensive public works.&#13;
In the municipality of Brazzaville&#13;
(a) Computerization of the technical unit and development of procedures to contract&#13;
out operations and maintenance of drainage and roads to the local private sector;&#13;
and&#13;
(b) Capacity building in maintenance planning, procurement, monitoring of&#13;
maintenance activities and performance of private sector contractors, and&#13;
provision of some limited training to selected local consultants and contractors in&#13;
the design and implementation of labor-intensive public works and administration&#13;
of contracts.&#13;
G. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
I.    Project Coverage and Implementation Period&#13;
47.   The project will be implemented over four years (June 2002 to July 2006). This period is&#13;
requested to implement the project in a smooth way considering the relatively weak capacity of&#13;
local consulting firms and contractors who will be involved in the execution of a large share of&#13;
the project. Activities will essentially be concentrated in Brazzaville and in the regions hardest&#13;
hit by the 1999 conflict and food and agricultural commodities producing areas.&#13;
48.   Progress made under the project will be reviewed during supervision missions, held twice&#13;
a year, by appropriately staffed Bank teams in order to cover the scope of the project.&#13;
Environmental, procurement and financial management issues will be reviewed during those&#13;
missions. Supervision will be jointly conducted with the Borrower and in collaboration with&#13;
various stakeholders. A mid-term review will take place at the end of the second year of the&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
project during which corrective measures will be recommended and adopted as needed. Donors&#13;
active in the country will be invited to participate in supervision missions and the aide memoire&#13;
will be sent to them. The first annual implementation review will take place 12 months after&#13;
credit effectiveness.  Subsequent reviews will assess implementation  arrangements,&#13;
achievements on physical outputs, procurement processes and disbursement levels. Detailed&#13;
progress reports will be prepared by the Project Implementation Unit and transmitted to IDA one&#13;
month before the review, and quarterly reports will also be prepared by the PIU and submitted to&#13;
IDA.&#13;
II.   Implementation Arrangements.&#13;
49.   In an attempt to build institutional capacity and speed up implementation, the project will&#13;
be coordinated and implemented by a Project Implementation Unit, which will be based at the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works and Equipment. The PIU will report to the Minister of Public Works&#13;
and Equipment and to the Project Steering committee. The PIU will function autonomously and&#13;
will have full responsibility for implementing all project components. The PIU will be assisted&#13;
by short-term technical assistance to handle the expected large flow of procurement activities for&#13;
the first two years of the project. This arrangement to reinforce the capacity of the PIU&#13;
concerning procurement will be evaluated every year and during the mid-term review and if&#13;
changes are needed, they will be implemented. The Government has signed a decree exempting&#13;
the PIU from using national procurement procedures. The PIU will therefore use its own&#13;
procurement procedures, which will be detailed in the Project Implementation Manual. The PIU&#13;
will be staffed by a Project coordinator, two technical specialists, a procurement specialist, a&#13;
financial management specialist who will be the Chief Finance Officer (CFO) and an&#13;
Infornation and Communication Officer. All PIU staff were selected on a competitive basis and&#13;
will be paid with credit resources. The steering committee, composed of representatives from&#13;
ministries (Ministry of Public Works and Equipment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health,&#13;
Ministry of the Interior, Security and Administration of the Territory, Ministry of Agriculture,&#13;
Ministry of Environment, Ministry in charge of Employment and Youth, and Ministry in charge&#13;
of demobilization) and the municipality of Brazzaville, will also include NGO representatives&#13;
and the private sector. This committee will oversee project execution and ensure consistency&#13;
between sector approaches and project implementation and ensure that issues and points raised&#13;
by NGOs are heard. The PIU will set up five technical committees with the main stakeholders&#13;
who are the city of Brazzaville, the Directorate of Public Works of the Ministry of Public Works,&#13;
the National Program for the fight against HIV/AIDS of the Ministry of Health, the railways&#13;
company (CFCO) and the Directorate for Studies and Planning of the Ministry of Education.&#13;
These committees will be briefed on technical designs and participate in the procurement process&#13;
(without interfering with it), and supervision of works and reception of goods.&#13;
50.   The railways component has been totally defined and goods to be acquired are well&#13;
identified. Bidding documents will be sent out and goods can be deliverecl in four to five months&#13;
after credit effectiveness. Detailed technical studies and bidding documents for primary and&#13;
secondary urban roads and drainage, tertiary urban roads and drainage, interurban and rural&#13;
roads, and erosion prevention will start by May 2002, and schools rehabilitation and HIV/A1DS&#13;
related activities would start by November 2002. Detailed technical studies and bidding&#13;
documents will be prepared by consultants recruited on a competitive basis. Other consultants&#13;
will be recruited to assist the PIU in evaluating bids, preparing works contracts and supervising&#13;
works. ILO will provide support to build capacity of local contractors to carry out labor-intensive&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
public works related to paving tertiary urban roads, drainage and rehabilitation of rural roads.&#13;
Annual technical audits will be conducted by auditors of experience and qualification acceptable&#13;
to IDA to review compliance with procurement procedures detailed in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual and quality of works undertaken.&#13;
III.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
51.   Procurement. Particular care has been given to procurement arrangements under this&#13;
project to ensure an immediate but transparent response to the emergency and recovery situation.&#13;
Implementation should be fast, efficient and transparent throughout the project.  The&#13;
Government has signed a decree exempting the PrU from following the national procurement&#13;
code in order to give full authority to advertise, evaluate and sign contracts to the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit. This decision is particularly sensitive and will expedite procurement&#13;
processes. The signing and publication of this decree was a condition of negotiation.&#13;
52.   In consulting assignments, national procedures (consistent with IDA guidelines) will be&#13;
used. Short-term assignments will be awarded using consultant qualifications selection method.&#13;
"Quality and Cost-Based" selection will represent the most used approach and will be limited to&#13;
long-term, time-based assignments and recruitment of international firms. Prior review by the&#13;
Bank will be limited to higher cost contracts (equivalent and more than US$100,000 for goods,&#13;
equivalent and more than US$400,000 for works, equivalent and more than US$100,000 for&#13;
consulting firms and US$50,000 for individual consultants). Procurement procedures and&#13;
methods are detailed in Annex G. In addition, procurement post reviews and SOE reviews will&#13;
be carried out, at least, once a year.&#13;
53.   Disbursement. The IDA credit will finance 100 percent of all expenditures. The&#13;
disbursement schedule will be as follows: 5 percent in FY02; 25 percent in FY03; 40 percent in&#13;
FY04; 20 percent in FY05; and 10 percent in FY06.&#13;
54.   Effectiveness Conditions: The conditions for credit effectiveness include the following:&#13;
(i) The Borrower has adopted the Project Implementation Manual, in form and substance&#13;
satisfactory to the Association; and&#13;
(ii) The Borrower has submitted the first year's procurement plan, satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
IV.    Financial Management, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
55.   Accounting and financial management of project funds will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Finance section of the PIU under the CFO. The project has selected a CFO and an Accountant&#13;
with adequate qualifications and experience to undertake their respective tasks.  Project&#13;
management and IDA will monitor developments, and recruitment of additional financial staff&#13;
will take place as soon as this becomes necessary with increase in project transactions volume.&#13;
56.   The Finance Section will (i) develop appropriate procedures, acceptable IDA, for&#13;
recording project expenditures, internal controls to be spelled out in the Project Implementation&#13;
Manual and manage of the Special Account, ensuring that project expenditures are incurred for&#13;
the purposes intended under the project, in accordance with established procedures, and that&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
adequate supporting (locumentation is retained for verif'ication by supervision missions and&#13;
extemnal auditors.&#13;
57.   IDA's requirement, as regards to submission of quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports&#13;
(FMRs), has been briefly explained to Government staff preparing the project. This will need a&#13;
more in depth dialogue with the financial staff once recruited. It is expected that the project will&#13;
commence submitting FMRs beginning with the first full (calendar) quarter after effectiveness.&#13;
IDA will provide further guidance to improve and bring these FMRs to a level acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The Bank's FMS has also indicated to the Government that the financial staff (soon after&#13;
their recruitment) will need to conmmence work on establishing an adequate accounting system,&#13;
acquiring an appropriate accounting software capable of maintaining project accounts and&#13;
generating financial data and periodic reports required by IDA.&#13;
58.   Financial statements of the project will be audited by independent external auditors,&#13;
under terms of reference acceptable to IDA. The Finance Section will establish the procedures to&#13;
ensure that project expenditures incurred are submitted and consolidated in time for external&#13;
audits. Audit reports will include a management report and separate opinions on use of SOEs and&#13;
Special Account will be submitted to IDA within six months following the end of each financial&#13;
year. It is expected that the first audit will be undertaken for financial statement as of December&#13;
31, 2002, and at the end of every six months thereafter. The Borrower has established a financial&#13;
management system satisfactory by IDA, to ensure adequate financial management of the&#13;
project.&#13;
59.   Special Account. The Project will have ore Special Account managed by the PIU. This&#13;
Special Account will be operated in accordance with the Bank's operational guidelines.&#13;
V.    Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
60.   Monitoring implementation progress of the proposed Project will be carried out through a&#13;
computerized Management Information System (MIS) established in the PIU. The MIS will&#13;
provide baseline informnation for quarterly and annual financial and activity reports. The&#13;
quarterly and annual reports will include information on project performance indicators. Project&#13;
impact will be related to the quantity of merchandise transported by the railways. This&#13;
information will be collected by the CFCO. Output indicators will be prepared by the PIU, based&#13;
on information and data provided by consultants supervising the different components. Output&#13;
indicators will be related to length of roads and drainage facilities built as well as number of&#13;
employment generated by the project. Impact and output indicators are presented in Annex H.&#13;
Technical audits performed by independent consultants will take place every year and will&#13;
review procurement efficiency and effectiveness as well as the quality of the works.&#13;
VII. Environmental Aspects&#13;
61.   The project is classified as environmental category B, based on the ISDS approved&#13;
January 9, 2002 and submitted to the Infoshop. Most of the works will be on rehabilitation of&#13;
existing roads and fixing existing drainage. Railway activities will not require land acquisition,&#13;
as most activities will consist of replacing radio-telecommunication equipment, sleepers and&#13;
fasteners and acquiring spare parts for track maintenance equipment. Existing railway transport&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
capacity will be more secured and no additional capacity of the railway is foreseen. Higher&#13;
logging, as a consequence of improved railway security, will not happen because no additional&#13;
transportation capacity will be financed by the project. The Transparency and Govemance&#13;
Project and the Economic and Sector Work on Natural Resource Management, to be financed by&#13;
the Bank, will help the Government strengthen its capacity to monitor logging and better&#13;
implement the new forestry law. These supports will reduce the risk of increased logging. The&#13;
project will improve the overall environmental condition in Brazzaville as construction and&#13;
rehabilitation of ditches will limit flooding and drain stagnant water. An Environmental&#13;
Assessment (EA) and, as appropriate, a Resettlement Framework or Plan (in the event of any&#13;
permanent or temporary land acquisition, displacement of people or loss of access to resources in&#13;
accordance with OP 4.12) for the entire project will be completed six months after credit&#13;
effectiveness. Because this operation is being processed under OP 8.50, the safeguards&#13;
documentation will be prepared during implementation (rather than prior to appraisal). In&#13;
addition, detailed technical studies will assess specific environmental impacts and address them&#13;
through environmental management plans. The EA process will entail public consultations.&#13;
The EA and Resettlement Framework (or documentation within the EA that shows no need for a&#13;
Resettlement Framework) will be submitted to the Africa Safeguards Policy Enhancement&#13;
(ASPEN) team for review and clearance prior to disclosure of the EA and Resettlement&#13;
Framework (if any) at the Infoshop and to affected groups and local NGOs in country.&#13;
VII. Sustainability&#13;
62.   Under the proposed project, responsibility for operation and maintenance of drainage&#13;
facilities will rest with the Municipality of Brazzaville, who will subcontract cleaning activities&#13;
to private enterprises. These companies will be selected on a competitive basis, for two to three-&#13;
year renewable contracts. Government has overhauled the maintenance system by clarifying the&#13;
lines of authority and responsibility and by dismantling the unit in charge of maintaining the road&#13;
network on a force account basis. Government is also in the process of selling the remaining&#13;
equipment of this unit. Under this new approach, urban road maintenance will be carried out by&#13;
the Municipality of Brazzaville and contracted out to private operators, while national roads will&#13;
continue to be the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works and Equipment. Interurban&#13;
road maintenance will be under the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works and&#13;
Equipment, who will use private contractors to carry out activities. For rural roads, the existing&#13;
arrangement involving beneficiaries and small enterprise contracting will be continued. Financial&#13;
resources needed for maintaining national, secondary and urban roads are collected and managed&#13;
by a Road Fund. The European Union will provide support to the Road Fund to better collect&#13;
funds, improve its operational capacity, financial management and transparency in the use of its&#13;
financial resources.&#13;
VIII. Government Ownership and Participatory Approach&#13;
63.   Government ownership of the proposed Emergency Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and&#13;
Living Conditions Improvement Project is adequate and will ensure its successful&#13;
implementation. Despite the lack of support from international donors (since 2000), the&#13;
Government has demonstrated its ability to rehabilitate infrastructure by using its own resources.&#13;
The Government had rehabilitated and reconstructed many urban roads and major social&#13;
infrastructure. During project identification and appraisal missions, discussions were carried out&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
with trade unions, local and international NGOs, the private sector, as well as donors in the field.&#13;
The Government has agreed to waive the project from the use of the national procurement code&#13;
to help expedite the implementation of the project. The Government established a Project&#13;
Preparation Unit just after the identification mission and has selected the PIU staff before&#13;
negotiations. The Government is in the process of signing the contracts of staff recruited on a&#13;
competitive basis to fill all the positions in the PIU. The municipality of Brazzaville has agreed&#13;
to substantially increase budget allocations for roads and drainage maintenance and to contract&#13;
out maintenance activities to the private sector. Particular care has been given to procurement&#13;
arrangements under this project to ensure an immediate but transparent response to the&#13;
emergency and recovery situation. Implementation should be fast, efficient and transparent&#13;
throughout the project. The Government has adopted and published a decree exempting the PIU&#13;
from following the national procurement code in order to give full authority to advertise,&#13;
evaluate and sign contracts to the Project Implementation Unit. This decision is particularly&#13;
sensitive and will expedite procurement processes.&#13;
H.    BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
I.    Benefits&#13;
64.   Potential benefits of support to the Republic of Congo in the form of the proposed Project&#13;
largely outweigh the risks. By focusing its financing priority areas (e.g. infrastructure, such as&#13;
roads and railways, social infrastructure and private sector rehabilitation), the project will&#13;
eventually jump-start the economy and create conditions for long-term development, while at the&#13;
same time tackling immediate economic and social needs of the most vulnerable people by&#13;
creating employment. Reestablishing a well functioning railway system between Pointe-Noire&#13;
(the port and the oil producing center) and Brazzaville is paramount to any economic&#13;
development and industrial activity in Brazzaville and in the country. In addition, a well&#13;
functioning railway system will increase availability of petroleum products to the Central&#13;
African Republic (CAR), and help reduce erratic variations of gasoline price and repeated&#13;
shortages of petroleum products in this country. Spill over effects will help create a more stable&#13;
economic and political environment in CAR, in particular, and security in Congo and in the&#13;
region as a whole. More specifically, the project will benefit local entrepreneurs and national&#13;
consulting firms, and improve living conditions in densely populated districts of Brazzaville and&#13;
in the regions. Benefits encompassing the Republic of Congo (and spread over the region) are&#13;
expected from the project because greater stability and peace in the Republic of Congo, as a&#13;
consequence of the project, will constitute a good example to follow for countries embattled in&#13;
conflicts in the troubled Central and Great Lakes region.&#13;
II.   Risks and Mitigation Measures&#13;
65.   In light of the Republic of Congo's fragile political situation and its relatively weak&#13;
implementation capacity, the proposed credit is at considerable risk. The first risk is political&#13;
and social, and can be associated with the failure of the transition process to democracy and to&#13;
building a political system that would resolve differences without recourse to violence. Such&#13;
failure could lead to renewed conflict, destruction of rebuilt infrastructure and slippage in project&#13;
implementation.  Faced with continued political and social instability, the Government's&#13;
determination to sustain implementation of emergency rehabilitation may be questioned. The&#13;
national dialogue on a new constitution and the convention for peace and national reconciliation,&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
held in April 2001, provides reassurances and illustrates the Government's commitment to&#13;
building a stable and peaceful political system. A constitution was approved on January 20,&#13;
2002, and Presidential elections took place on March 10, 2002.&#13;
66.   The second risk is the weak institutional and administrative capacity that could lead to&#13;
delays in project implementation. To mitigate this risk, the proposed Project would use (i)&#13;
simplified implementation arrangements to accommodate the limited capacity with only one&#13;
PIU, staffed with personnel selected on a competitive basis and assisted by short-term technical&#13;
assistance; and (ii) streamlined procurement processes by giving full responsibility to the PIU&#13;
and up front adoption of standard bidding documents. A third risk is linked to the difficulty of&#13;
the Government to service its debt with the Bank on time and the suspension of disbursements&#13;
for the project. Support provided by the Bank through future Public Expenditure Reviews and&#13;
increased transparency in the collection and use of national resources that is foreseen from the&#13;
implementation of the Transparency and Government Project financed by the Bank, will help&#13;
mitigate this risk.&#13;
67.   While the risks are considerable in the Republic of Congo, the cost of no support from&#13;
the international community would exacerbate the violence, which has been under control since&#13;
the end of 1999. A lack of support from the international community would also create a lost&#13;
generation of uneducated youth who could be a danger to the society in years to come, as social&#13;
systems further fall into disarray. Uncontrolled violence and continued instability in the&#13;
Republic of Congo would also have severe implications for peace in the delicate Great Lakes&#13;
region and the entire Central Africa.&#13;

ANNEX E- STATUS OF BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN REPUBLIC OF CONGO&#13;
Since 1997, the Republic of Congo has been in non-accrual status. As a result, all project&#13;
disbursements came to a halt in 1997. The last project in the portfolio, the Privatization and&#13;
Capacity Building Project, approved by the Board in 1995, was closed at the end of 1999. An&#13;
IDF Post Conflict emergency grant, amounting to US$0.9 million, to finance technical assistance&#13;
in support of reconstruction and on-going economic reform efforts, was approved in June 1998,&#13;
but could not be implemented as a new cycle of violence resurged in December 1998. With a&#13;
return to normalcy, the signing at the end of 1999 of a peace accord, and cessation of hostilities,&#13;
which are holding very firmly, another IDF Post Conflict emergency grant, amounting to US$1&#13;
million,   was    approved     in  February     2001.      In   addition,   a  US$5     million    Emergency&#13;
Demobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration Credit (Cr 3561 COB), and a US$37.5 million&#13;
Post Conflict ERC, were approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on July 31, 2001. The&#13;
Transparency and Governance Transparency Credit was approved on February 7, 2002.&#13;

ANNEX F- PROCUREMENT&#13;
GENERAL&#13;
1.1   A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) for the Republic of Congo has not&#13;
been carried out since 1987. The country's procurement procedures do not conflict with Bank&#13;
Guidelines. No special exceptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in the Credit&#13;
documents, since the Republic of Congo's procurement practices allow IDA procedures to take&#13;
precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations. The Country's Procurement&#13;
capacity has been weakened substantially following the civil war in 1997.&#13;
1.2.  Substantial capacity rebuilding will be needed to recreate procurement proficiency at the&#13;
central and sector levels. It is anticipated that during the Transparency and Governance Capacity&#13;
Building Project (TGCBP), capacity of the public procurement system will be assessed and an&#13;
action plan prepared to develop a training program to strengthen capacity and help reduce the&#13;
procurement risk level for Government and future IDA-financed investments. In 1982, a legal&#13;
text created a procurement committee (Commission Nationale des Marches) under the&#13;
responsibility of the Presidency and chaired by a representative of the MEFB.&#13;
1.3.  Several Committee members are reportedly not familiar with Bank guidelines and&#13;
procedures on procurement and disbursement. Since Committee members will not be involved&#13;
in the project as TGCB project will help build the required capacity. PIU Staff will also receive&#13;
intensive training in procurement procedures under the current project. In order to strengthen&#13;
capacity to handle procurement activities, a Procurement Specialist will be recruited to work&#13;
under the supervision of the PIU coordinator. The procurement specialist will be assisted by&#13;
short-term consultants.&#13;
1.4.  Goods and Works, financed by IDA, will be procured in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 revised in January&#13;
and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999). The Bank Standard Bidding Documents,&#13;
and Standard Evaluation Reports will be used for ICB. National Competitive Bidding (NCB),&#13;
advertised locally, will be carried out in accordance with the Republic of Congo's procurement&#13;
laws and regulations acceptable to IDA provided that: (i) methods used in evaluation of bids and&#13;
the award of contracts are made known to all bidders and not be applied arbitrarily; (ii) any&#13;
bidder is given adequate response time (four weeks) for preparation and submnission of bids; (iii)&#13;
bid evaluation and bidder qualification are clearly specified in bidding documents; (iv) no&#13;
preference margin is granted to domestic manufacturers and domestic contractors; (v) All firms&#13;
are not precluded from participation; (vi) award will be made to the lowest evaluated bidder, in&#13;
accordance with pre-determined and transparent methods; and (vii) bid evaluation reports will&#13;
clearly state the reasons for rejecting any non-responsive bid. Sample bidding documents for&#13;
NCB (works and goods) were prepared and agreed upon during negotiations and will be used as&#13;
standard documents during project implementation.&#13;
1.5.  Consultant Services Contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank borrowers&#13;
(January 1997, revised in September 1997, and January 1999). The Standard Request for&#13;
Proposal, as developed by the Bank, will be used for appointment of consultants as well as the&#13;
Sample formn of Evaluation Report for the Selection of Consultants. Simplified contracts will be&#13;
28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
used for short-term assignments, i.e. those not exceeding six months, carried out by firms&#13;
or individual consultants.&#13;
1.6.  A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in the United Nations&#13;
(UN) Development Business before credit effectiveness, to advertise for any Goods, and&#13;
Works to be procured through ICB and for major consulting assignment to obtain&#13;
Expression of Interest (EOI). The GPN will also be published in the national press for&#13;
contract to be executed under NCB. The GPN will be updated every year. Specific&#13;
Procurement Notices (SPN) for contracts for 'Works (above US$400,000) and Goods&#13;
(above US$100,000) and Expressions of Interest (EOI) for large contract for consultant&#13;
services (above US$ 100,000) will also be advertised in UN Development Business and&#13;
sufficient time will be allowed for responses to such notice (minimum 30 days) before&#13;
developing the short list.&#13;
Procurement Implementation Arrangement&#13;
1.7   Responsibility for all procurement will rest with the PIU, which shall be legally&#13;
established by July 31, 2002. The PIU will continue preparation of the project and will&#13;
be responsible for project implementation. A procurement specialist will be recruited. In&#13;
order to ensure that the PIU staff are fully aware of all procuremient Guidelines, a&#13;
procurement session will be organized during the project launch, which, is scheduled to&#13;
be conducted before September 30, 2002.  During the first 18 months of project&#13;
implementation, the PIU will be assisted by short-term internationally recruited&#13;
procurement consultants. This arrangement will be evaluated every year and during the&#13;
mid-term review and if needed, appropriate actions will be implemented in order to&#13;
strengthen the PIU's capacity to handle effectively and efficiently procurement activities.&#13;
1.8   Information regarding procurement adm:nistration will be collected, recorded and&#13;
sent to IDA through quarterly reports. These reports will include information about (i)&#13;
complaints/disputes; (ii) performance of contractors/consultants; (iii) procurement issues;&#13;
(iv) revised cost estimates for contracts; (v) revised timing of procurement actions and&#13;
completion times; (vi) updated procurement plan for the year; and (vii) compliance with&#13;
aggregate limits on specified procurement methods.&#13;
Procurement Capacity Assessment of the PIU&#13;
1.9   An assessment of PIU's capacity to implement project procureiment in accordance&#13;
with the criteria outlined in Annex 3 of LACI Implementation Hand Book was completed&#13;
(detailed report is in the project files). The review addressed the legal aspects,&#13;
procurement cycle management, organization and function of the procurement staff in the&#13;
actual Project Preparation Unit (PPU), support and control systems, record keeping and&#13;
staffing of the PIU. The review assessed the risks (institutional, procedural) that may&#13;
negatively affect the ability of the PIU to carry out procurement activities. The risks&#13;
identified in the assessment are the following: (i) abusive use of sole source/direct&#13;
contracting; (ii) inadequate submission period for bids; (iii) lack of sufficiently qualified&#13;
procurement specialists in the country; (iv) lack of training of staff handling procurement&#13;
matters; (v) long contract signing delays; and (vi) inconsistency of the country&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
procurement legislation, which has not been revised since 1983. A portfolio review of&#13;
IDA financed investment projects completed before 1997 has confirmed that procurement&#13;
capacity is generally weak in the country. This has led, among other factors, to slower&#13;
disbursements, in some cases to misuse of funds. In addition, the economic and political&#13;
atmosphere in the country, in which the law operates, is not conducive to fair and&#13;
transparent procurement processes. Therefore, the Republic of Congo appears as a "high&#13;
risk" country from a procurement point of view.&#13;
1.10 The prior review thresholds recommended are those applicable to a "high risk"&#13;
country. In collaboration with the actual Project Preparation Unit, an action plan to&#13;
address deficiencies has been prepared to strengthen the PIU's capacity to administer&#13;
procurement in an effective and transparent way. The plan includes: (i) the recruitment of&#13;
a procurement specialist (to be adequately trained to effectively handle procurement); (ii)&#13;
the provision to the PIU of the Bank's standard procurement documents during project&#13;
negotiations; (iii) organization of procurement training sessions during the project launch&#13;
workshop that will take place before credit effectiveness; (iv) participation of a Bank&#13;
procurement specialist in supervision missions twice a year during the first 18 months of&#13;
the project to conduct post reviews and to provide guidance and support to the PIU in&#13;
carrying out procurement activities; (v) preparation of a Project Implementation (PIM)&#13;
which will cover procurement activities; (vi) development of a procurement and contract&#13;
management information system to be integrated in the computerized financial&#13;
management system to be set up for the project; (vii) organization of a filing system to&#13;
ensure availability of, and easy access to procurement records; and (viii) review of a&#13;
minimum of one in every three contracts representing different procurement methods (not&#13;
subject to prior review) during supervision missions on an ex-post basis.&#13;
Procurement Plan&#13;
1.11  The procurement plan for the first year was prepared during appraisal and will be&#13;
finalized before effectiveness. The exact mix of procurement will be determined on an&#13;
annual basis during annual joint reviews between the PIU, and IDA, where a draft&#13;
procurement plan for the following financial year will be developed and submitted to IDA&#13;
for review and approval. The plan will include relevant information on goods, civil works&#13;
and consulting services under the project, as well as the timing of the procurement&#13;
process. The procurement schedule will be updated semi-annually for the first 18 months&#13;
and quarterly thereafter for PMR based disbursement. This plan will be reviewed by IDA&#13;
during each supervision mission.&#13;
1.12  The conditions for effectiveness related to procurement is that a procurement plan&#13;
for the first year of the project acceptable to IDA should be produced.&#13;
1.13 The Government assured IDA during negotiations that it will: (i) use the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents, for ICB, the Standard Request for Proposals for the&#13;
selection of consultants, and the Standard Bid Evaluation Report; (ii) apply procurement&#13;
procedures and arrangements outlined in the above documents; (iii) update the&#13;
procurement plan on a regular basis during the annual review with IDA, compare target&#13;
dates and actual completion, and transmit it to IDA during implementation; and (iv) carry&#13;
30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
out (during annual reviews) an assessment of the effectiveness of the bidding procedures&#13;
and performance as they relate to project procurement experience, and propose for IDA's&#13;
consideration any modifications to the current procedures to the extent that would&#13;
accelerate procurement, while still maintaining compliance with the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines, adequate contract award and payments.&#13;
1.14 The Government agrees to use NCB documents acceptable to IDA and&#13;
streamlined procedures for contracts signing.&#13;
2.    Procurement Methods&#13;
2.1   The methods to be used for procurement (described below) and estimated&#13;
amounts for each method, are summarized in Table A. The threshold contract values for&#13;
the use of each method are fixed in Table B.&#13;
2.2   Civil Works. Civil work contracts estimated to cost more than US$400,000 will&#13;
be procured through International Competitive Bidding procedures in accordance with&#13;
World Bank Guidelines.&#13;
2.3   Civil work contracts estimated to cost less that US$400,000, up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$9.22 million, will be procured through National Competitive Bidding procedures in&#13;
accordance with procedures described in the PIM and acceptable to IDA.&#13;
2. 4. Goods. The total cost of goods for the project is estimated at US$14.33 million.&#13;
Procurement of goods will be bulked, where feasible, into packages valued at&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent or more per package and will be procured through International&#13;
Competitive Bidding. Contracts for goods and equipment for railways, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$0.44 million, which can only be provided by the specific manufacturers of&#13;
the trains, will be procured through direct contracting in accordance with paragraph 3.7 of&#13;
the Bank's Guidelines. Goods and equipment, locally available, which cannot be grouped&#13;
together into packages of at least US$100,000 equivalent, will be awarded on the basis of&#13;
NCB in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$0.48 million equivalent.&#13;
2.5. Procurement for small quantities of items, such as office equipment, furniture,&#13;
printed materials and other instructional material normally considered to be standard&#13;
items which cannot be grouped into packages of at least US$30,000 equivalent, will be&#13;
procured through prudent National Shopping and in accordance with paragraph 3.5 of the&#13;
Guidelines, provided that the aggregate amount of such contracts does not exceed&#13;
US$0.36 million equivalent. International shopping, in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
paragraph 3.6 of the guidelines up to an aggregate amount of US$ 0.55 million&#13;
equivalent, will be used for the supply of specialized equipment, Lab material and&#13;
railway equipment for the HIV/AIDS and Railway components. Solicitations will be&#13;
issued in writing to at least three reputable suppliers in order to receive price quotations.&#13;
Solicitation will give specifications and the delivery time. Written quotations will be&#13;
opened at the same time for evaluation, and records of award decisions will be kept for&#13;
31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the Bank's supervision missions and audits. Specific shopping procedures to be followed&#13;
will be reflected in the procurement section of the PIM.&#13;
2.6   Subject to the agreed limits, the aggregate values for NCB or other non-ICB&#13;
procurement methods for goods cannot be exceeded without the prior no-objection of the&#13;
Bank. The PIU will maintain a tracking system to monitor such procurement in order to&#13;
inform the Bank in a timely manner when this may occur.&#13;
2.7 The total aggregate amounts and the procedures followed for all&#13;
shopping methods under the project will be reviewed during project supervision;&#13;
depending on performance, and the result of the review, the total aggregate amount may&#13;
be adjusted where necessary.&#13;
Domestic Preference&#13;
2.8   The provisions of paragraphs 2.54 and 2.55 of the Guidelines and Appendix 2&#13;
thereto shall apply to goods manufactured in the territory of the Borrower and to works to&#13;
be carried out by domestic contractors.&#13;
Consultants Services and Training&#13;
2.9.  Consulting services to be financed by IDA (totaling, US$3.25 rnillion equivalent)&#13;
would be for detailed technical studies, supervision of works and hiring of individual&#13;
consultants. Consultants will be hired through competition based on Quality-and Cost-&#13;
Based Selection (QCBS) among qualified short-listed firms; by evaluating the quality of&#13;
the proposals before combining quality and cost evaluations; and by weighting the quality&#13;
and cost scores. Least-Cost Selection (LCS), in accordance with para.3.1 and 3.6 of the&#13;
Consultant Guidelines, will be used for audit contracts costing less than US$50,000. The&#13;
firm with the lowest price will be selected, provided its technical proposal receives the&#13;
minimum mark. Services for training and supervising local contractors to prepare and&#13;
implement labor-intensive public works to cost not more than US$90,000 may be&#13;
procured to ILO in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3.13 of the Consultant&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
2.10  The selection of Individual Consultants Services for small studies and specialized&#13;
advisory service (special assignments, technical assistance to the municipalities, the&#13;
NMinistry of Public Works and the PIU) will be on the basis of comparison of curriculum&#13;
vitae in accordance with para.5.1 through 5.3 of the Consultant Guidelines. The PIU will&#13;
ensure widely publicized procurement notices to candidacy from consultants (firms and&#13;
individuals). The PIU will maintain and update a list of consultants which will be used to&#13;
establish short-lists.&#13;
2.11  Short-lists for contracts estimated under US$50,000 may be comprised of national&#13;
consultants (in accordance with paragraph. 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines) provided&#13;
that a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are available at competitive&#13;
costs. However, if foreign firms express interest, they will not be excluded from&#13;
32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
consideration. The Standard Request for Proposal (RFP), as developed by the Bank, will&#13;
be used for requesting proposals and for selection and appointment of consulting firms.&#13;
Simplified contracts will be used for short-term assignments, simple missions of standard&#13;
nature (i.e. those not exceeding six months) carried out by individual consultants or firms.&#13;
The Government were briefed during negotiations about the special features of the&#13;
guidelines and the RFP, in particular with regard to advertisement, public bid opening,&#13;
and evaluation criteria.&#13;
2.12  Training, workshops, and study tours will be carried out on the basis of approved&#13;
annual work programs that identify the general framework of training or similar activities&#13;
for the year, including the nature of training/study tours/workshops, the number of&#13;
participants and cost estimates.&#13;
3.    IDA Prior Reviews&#13;
3. 1.  Contracts financed by IDA, above the threshold value of US$400,000 and US$&#13;
100,000 equivalent for civil works and goods respectively, will be subject to IDA prior&#13;
review. Contracts below these specified thresholds will be subject to post review during&#13;
IDA's supervision missions with the exception of the first three NCB contracts, the first&#13;
three contracts awarded under national shopping, and all contracts awarded under&#13;
international shopping.&#13;
3. 2.  With respect to consultant services, prior IDA review will apply to contracts for&#13;
the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost US$100.000&#13;
equivalent or more and US$50,000 equivalent or more, respectively. Prior review will&#13;
also apply to the Terms of Reference of contracts (regardless of the value), to single-&#13;
source hiring, to all contracts for PIU staff and contracts for audits, or to amendments of&#13;
contracts rising the contract value above the prior review threshold. For consultant&#13;
contracts (firms) estimated above US$100,000, opening of financial envelopes will not&#13;
take place prior to receiving the Bank's no objection to the technical evaluation. For&#13;
contracts with consulting firms, estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and more than&#13;
US$50,000, the Borrower will notify IDA of the results of technical evaluation prior to&#13;
opening financial proposals. Prior review will apply for the first three contracts under&#13;
Individual Consultants.&#13;
3.3.  All out of country training will be subject to prior review by IDA. Post reviews&#13;
will be conducted from time to time to review the selection of institutions/course,&#13;
contents/trainees, justifications, and costs incurred.&#13;
3.4   Documents related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be&#13;
maintained by the PIU for ex-post review by auditors and IDA supervision missions.&#13;
33&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.      Project Implementation Manual: Procurement&#13;
4.1     The PIM, to be prepared by the Borrower, as a condition of effectiveness will&#13;
include a specific section on Procurement detailing: (i) procedures for planning, calling&#13;
for bids, selecting contractors, consultants, and vendors, and awarding contracts; (ii)&#13;
internal organization for supervision and control of works; and (iii) procedures for&#13;
handing over completed works.&#13;
4.2     The Government will also give assurance at negotiations that it will take&#13;
necessary measures to ensure that procurement phases do not exceed the following target&#13;
time periods:&#13;

ANNEX G: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
Overall Project Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Arrangements and Flow of&#13;
Funds&#13;
1.    One Special Account will be established in local currency in a commercial Bank&#13;
and will be managed by the PIU according to normal procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
2.     Financial management, as well as disbursement of the project, will be&#13;
implemented by the PIU.&#13;
Basic Principles&#13;
3.    The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the PIU team will be entrusted with the&#13;
Project's overall financial management and reporting and will serve as the principal&#13;
contact for Bank disbursement purposes. Payments to beneficiaries will flow from the&#13;
Special Account (SA) and will be made according to predetermined disbursement&#13;
schedules, to be specified in respective proposals. Transfer payments will be effected&#13;
expeditiously when due, and fund management will follow transparent procedures that&#13;
will be standardized and detailed in the Project ][mplementation Manual.&#13;
Use of Statements of Expenses (SOEs)&#13;
4.    Use of SOEs will be contingent upon a satisfactory assessment of the PIU's&#13;
financial management capacity, including the maintenance of proper accounts,&#13;
preparation of project progress reports, the ability to process and maintain SOE&#13;
documentation, and satisfactory annual auditingi arrangements. Provided these conditions&#13;
are met, SOEs will be used for all expenses. Furthermore, all expenses related to&#13;
contracts below prior-review thresholds would be claimed on the basis of SOEs and the&#13;
supporting documentation underlying all SOEs will be made available for review by&#13;
Bank supervision missions at any time. Supporting documentation will be retained by the&#13;
PIU. The primary responsibility of maintaining records rests on the CFO. The&#13;
satisfactory assessment of the financial management system will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
5.    The Government would open a Special Account (SA) in the name of the PIU with&#13;
a commercial bank, to which project funds will be deposited. The objective of the&#13;
Special account is that most credit funds be disbursed through this procedure. Only&#13;
amounts exceeding 25 percent of the amount advanced to the Special Account could be&#13;
claimed through the direct payment procedure. The PIU will receive an initial advance to&#13;
commence operations. The advance will initially be kept to a limited amount while the&#13;
project activities get underway, but would be increased once full execution begins and&#13;
cumulated disbursements reach a predetermined threshold. The initial amount, the&#13;
disbursement threshold, and the maximum special account amount were agreed upon&#13;
during negotiations. For subsequent disbursements, the PIU would submit appropriate&#13;
37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
justification on the use of amounts disbursed earlier (bank reconciliation statements and&#13;
other reasonable documentation) to IDA. An external auditor acceptable to IDA will&#13;
audit the Special Account annually. At the time replenishment of the SA is requested, the&#13;
PIll will indicate on their reconciliation statement the location and amounts outstanding&#13;
in any other project account.&#13;
38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX H: MONITORING AND EVALUATION; SOCIAL AND&#13;
ENVIRONM1ENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
Environmental and Social Aspects&#13;
1.    The Project is classified as environmental category B because no component is&#13;
expected to have a significant environmental impact. The only construction that is&#13;
envisaged is the reconstruction and rehabilitation of war-damaged roads, bridges, and&#13;
community infrastructure. In addition, the Project is expected to have a major positive&#13;
environmental impact through the drainage work and rehabilitation of roads and bridges.&#13;
2.    The social and environmental assessment will evaluate potential environmental&#13;
impacts associated with roads being rebuilt and potential impacts of the construction of&#13;
roads linking agricultural production areas to Brazzaville. However, given that most of&#13;
the rehabilitation and reconstruction will be on previously existing facilities, very few&#13;
people are expected to be displaced. An environmental impact assessment will be carried&#13;
out within six months of project effectiveness to evaluate any negative impact the railway&#13;
rehabilitation or other components of this project may have on the environment.&#13;
Relevant mitigation measures will be translated into implementation guidelines. The&#13;
social and environmental assessment will also be used to establish a baseline from which&#13;
to evaluate the success of the Project in reestablishing people's livelihoods.&#13;

            Congo, Republic of - Emergency

            Improvement Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Emergency
            Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Living Conditions
            Improvement Project in Congo, is to contribute to the
            re-establishment of basic economic activities, and social
            services, by rehabilitating primary, secondary, and urban
            roads, drainage and school facilities. By prioritizing areas
            in infrastructure, such as roads, social infrastructure and
            private sector rehabilitation, the credit will benefit the
            jump-start of the economy, and create conditions for
            long-term development, while tackling immediate economic and
            social needs of the most vulnerable, i.e., employment
            creation. Specifically, the project will benefit local
            entrepreneurs, and national consulting firms, and improve
            living conditions. Nonetheless, political and social risks,
            associated with the failure of the transition process to
            democracy, and to building a political system that will
            resolve differences without recourse to violence, may hinder
            success, in addition to weak institutional, and
            administrative capacities, and the Government's
            inability to service its debt with the Bank. However, the
            project will use simplified implementation arrangements, and
            streamline procurement processes, as well as provide support
            to the upcoming Public Expenditures Review, to mitigate risks.
