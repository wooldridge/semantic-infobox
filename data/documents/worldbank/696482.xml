UTTAR PRADESH RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:           India, acting by its President&#13;
Executing Agency:  Department of Rural Development&#13;
Beneficiary:        The State of Uttar Pradesh&#13;
Amount:             IBRD loan of US$59.6 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:              Loan repayable in twenty years, including five years of grace, at&#13;
standard variable interest rate.&#13;
On-lending Terms:  From GOI to Government of Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) under&#13;
standard arrangements for developmental assistance to the states&#13;
of India. GOI would assume the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Project Objectives:  The project has two main objectives. The first objective is to&#13;
deliver sustainable health and hygiene benefits to the rural&#13;
population, through improvements in water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation services, which will increase rural&#13;
incomes through time savings and income opportunities for&#13;
women, test an alternative to the current supply driven service&#13;
delivery mechanism and promote sanitation and gender awareness.&#13;
The second objective is to promote the long-term sustainability of&#13;
the rural water supply and sanitation sector by providing assistance&#13;
to GOUP to identify and implement an appropriate policy&#13;
framework and strategic plan.&#13;
Project Description: The project is conceived to support a package of demand-driven&#13;
investments in selected districts in the State of Uttar Pradesh and a&#13;
process of policy reform in the State. The proposed project would&#13;
have three main components. The first is the strengthening and&#13;
operation of the Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMiU&#13;
would be responsible for selecting support organizations, using&#13;
transparent eligibility criteria, helping communities to prepare&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
and implement rural water supply and environmental sanitation&#13;
schemes (schemes); appraising, selecting, and financing schemes&#13;
that fulfill eligibility criteria, and monitoring major scheme-&#13;
related activities. The second component is the selection and&#13;
construction of water supply and environmental sanitation&#13;
facilities for single and regional schemes. This component&#13;
would finance improvements of water supply and environmental&#13;
sanitation services for about 1,000 communities for a design&#13;
population of about 1.2 million. Single schemes include a&#13;
maximum of two villages, and regional schemes include more&#13;
than two villages. This component would include community&#13;
development activities and the construction of water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation schemes. Community development&#13;
activities would promote active participation of the communities&#13;
in all stages of decisions about the planning, construction, and&#13;
management of their scheme, to increase local ownership and&#13;
effective use and sustainability. These activities comprise&#13;
capacity building such as community mobilization and&#13;
organization and nonformal education; hygiene and&#13;
environmental sanitation awareness, and women's development&#13;
initiatives including orientation and training. Construction of&#13;
water supply and environmental sanitation schemes includes&#13;
financing for pre-feasibility studies, design, construction, and&#13;
construction monitoring for water supply schemes, human waste&#13;
disposal, drainage, environmental management, and catchment&#13;
protection. The third component is studies and sector&#13;
development. This component would support a major policy&#13;
study whose objective would be to help the GOUP identify the&#13;
issues affecting sector performance and formulate appropriate&#13;
policy reforms for the sector. The component will also support a&#13;
major statewide awareness campaign on sanitation and gender&#13;
issues and selected studies on sectoral issues.&#13;
Poverty:              Over half of project beneficiaries would be in the poverty group.&#13;
However, the project is not specifically targeting poverty as it&#13;
operates with entire communities, based upon their demand for&#13;
rural water supply and environmental sanitation services rather&#13;
than their poverty.&#13;
Environment:          The project is rated Category B. Several environmental mitigation&#13;
measures have been included in the project design, and the project is&#13;
expected to have a net positive effect on the environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- jjj -&#13;
Scheme prefeasibility and feasibility studies will be carried out prior&#13;
to construction and will include an environmental assessment. One&#13;
of the scheme funding eligibility criteria requires that scheme&#13;
proposals include adequate provisions to mitigate any identified&#13;
adverse environmental impact.&#13;
Benefits:              Direct project beneficiaries would be approximately 1.2 million&#13;
rural inhabitants who would benefit from improved water supply&#13;
and environmental sanitation services through both time savings in&#13;
collecting water and better health from more and cleaner water,&#13;
improved health knowledge, and better hygiene practices. Women&#13;
would also be major beneficiaries. In addition, they would benefit&#13;
through being full members of the Village Water and Sanitation&#13;
Committees responsible for the project at community level and&#13;
through specific components designed to empower them. The&#13;
process of policy reforms promoted under the project would bring&#13;
lasting benefits to rural communities throughout the State of Uttar&#13;
Pradesh.&#13;
Risks:                 The principal risks of the project are: there may be resistance to the&#13;
approach promoted by the project, particularly in carrying out the&#13;
demand-led approach envisaged; more time and effort than now&#13;
foreseen may be required to build capacity in support organizations,&#13;
communities, and the Project Management Unit (PMU), implying a&#13;
shortfall in implementation from the current forecast; and financial&#13;
sustainability of the schemes may not materialize. For the first risk,&#13;
considerable effort and resources have been allocated under the&#13;
project to provide training to PMU/District Project Management&#13;
Units (DPMUs) as well as support organization (SO) staff and&#13;
project beneficiaries. In addition, the project's monitoring system&#13;
.Will carefully review PMIU/DPMU, SO, and beneficiary&#13;
performance in this respect. This issue would also be closely&#13;
monitored by supervision missions. Should the second risk&#13;
materialize, the main consequence would be that fewer schemes&#13;
would be financed during the project period. Intensive monitoring&#13;
and evaluation are intended to highlight any problems as they arise,&#13;
and to enable the PMU to fashion appropriate solutions. For the&#13;
third risk, the strict application of transparent and objective&#13;
eligibility criteria should ensure that only those villages that&#13;
demonstrate a strong commitment to contributing to costs are&#13;
selected. To mitigate this risk, a strong monitoring system is&#13;
proposed under the project. In addition independent audits will be&#13;
carried out to ensure strict adherence to agreements regarding&#13;
application of eligibility criteria.&#13;

UTTAR PRADESH RURAL WATER SUPPLY&#13;
AND ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
I. RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
Country Background&#13;
1.01      In spite of significant government investments in rural water supply in India, almost&#13;
half (43%) of the country's predominantly rural population does not have access to an adequate&#13;
supply of safe drinking water. Sanitation is even worse, with less than 10 % percent of the rural&#13;
population having access to sanitary latrines. In addition, public facilities for drainage are poor.&#13;
As a result, water-related diseases are a major health problem in India, particularly for infants and&#13;
children. There are unofficial estimates that as many as 80% of all children have some form of&#13;
diarrheal disease (including common diarrhea) each year. There are area-specific problems of&#13;
water-related diseases such as guinea worm and fluorosis. Also, villagers spend a considerable&#13;
amount of time in collecting water for domestic use, averaging 1-3 hours per day; in arid or hilly&#13;
locations they spend even more time. The problem is aggravated by underdesigned water supply&#13;
systems and poor operation and maintenance (O&amp;M). Therefore, a reliable, safe source of&#13;
domestic water supply linked to improved environmental sanitation is a necessary precondition for&#13;
improving health standards and economic productivity in Indian villages.&#13;
1.02      According to the 1991 census, India's population was 845 million, of which 627&#13;
million (74%) lived in the rural areas. The rural population living in over 1.3 million habitations'&#13;
(586,000 revenue villages2) is growing at 2% per annum. Overall infant mortality rate has fallen&#13;
from 116 per 1,000 births to about 80 per 1,000 births in 10 years but remains very high&#13;
compared to most countries. Similarly, maternal mortality at 550 per 10,000 births is three times&#13;
that of Sri Lanka and ten times that of China. The productivity of the population is reduced by&#13;
high incidence of diseases. In 1991, overall literacy for people above the age of seven stood at&#13;
52%; for women, the rate was 39%. In 1986-87, 70% of rural females and 43% of rural males&#13;
above six years of age had never enrolled in any educational institution. In 1987-88, it was&#13;
estimated that over 33% of the rural population lived below the poverty line.&#13;
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Service Levels&#13;
1.03      The Government of India (GOI) norm3 for providing drinking water supply facilities in&#13;
rural areas requires 40 liters of potable water per person per day in all areas for human beings and&#13;
I     "Habitation" refers to a hamlet within a village.&#13;
2     Section 3 (25) of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition Land Reform Act, 1950, defines a revenue village&#13;
as "any local area whether compact or otherwise recorded as a village in the revenue records of the&#13;
District concerned and includes an area which the State Government may, by a general or special order&#13;
declare to be a village". The revenue village may comprise several hamlets, but the entire village is&#13;
treated as one unit.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
an additional 30 liters per person per day in Desert Development Program areas for drinking&#13;
water requirements of cattle. Habitations that are not getting a full supply of 40 lpcd are treated as&#13;
partially covered and require augmentation facilities to bring them to the 40 Ipcd level. If the&#13;
habitations are not getting safe drinking water within a distance of 1.6 km in plains and within 100&#13;
meters elevation difference in hilly areas, these are treated as not covered. The habitations having&#13;
more than 40 lpcd of potable water are termed fully covered. According to the norm, one source&#13;
should be provided for 250 people. The norm is more liberal for schedule castes, schedule tribes&#13;
and hilly areas depending on actual needs.&#13;
1.04     GOI carried out an extensive nationwide survey4 in 1994 to reassess the water supply&#13;
and sanitation situation in the country's 1.3 million habitations. The survey found the following:&#13;
Not covered habitations          10.69%&#13;
Partially covered habitations    32.64%&#13;
Fully covered habitations        56.67%&#13;
It was found that, of the 430,400 partially covered habitations, some 45% had lower than a 20&#13;
Ipcd supply.&#13;
1.05     About 80% of the existing water supply systems are based on handpumps, and only&#13;
about 20% are based on piped water systems tapped either from surface or ground water sources.&#13;
H-ill states usually adopt piped systems since drilling for handpumps in these areas is generally not&#13;
possible. Rivers, rivulets, and springs are tapped for drinking water to these regions.&#13;
1.06     Because of the wide geographic diversity and range of incomes among and within&#13;
states, rural water supply service levels range from traditional open wells and handpumps to&#13;
urban-style piped water supply schemes with treatment plants and a small proportion of private&#13;
connections. Due to poor power supply and lack of water, piped water is available only a few&#13;
hours a day. Many Indian villages often have small hamlets that are located at some distance from&#13;
the main village. Field studies indicate that use of safe water sources is minimal beyond about 150&#13;
meters if alternative water source, even polluted ones, are available. Thus, even if a safe source is&#13;
provided, a much smaller population will actually use the source because of distance to the source&#13;
or social factors such as caste (members of high and lower castes may not share the same water&#13;
source).&#13;
1.07     In addition to use, poor O&amp;M of facilities is a major problem. About one-third of&#13;
rural water sources are out of operation at any one time. Taking into consideration the distance&#13;
which people are willing to walk to obtain water, social factors, and likely down time, it is&#13;
estimated that one-half or more of the rural population are still using traditional, polluted sources&#13;
of water.&#13;
1.08     Rural environmental sanitation facilities are defined in broad terms to include private&#13;
and community latrines, public sullage and storm drainage systems, soak pits (private household&#13;

disposal of sullage water), washing platforms, bathing cubicles (for women), cattle troughs,&#13;
garbage and dung disposal. The lack of these facilities, especially in larger villages (populations&#13;
over 1,000), combined with inadequate hygiene practices and polluted water sources, contribute&#13;
to the spread of water-related diseases.&#13;
1.09     It is estimated that less than 10% of the rural population have access to sanitary&#13;
latrines. In many cases where latrines have been provided under government-sponsored&#13;
programs, they are not used because of individual preferences for open fields. However, demand&#13;
for latrines is increasing, in more densely populated areas where privacy and security, particularly&#13;
for women, are a problem.&#13;
1.10     Uttar Pradesh. According to the 1991 census, the State of Uttar Pradesh had a&#13;
population of 139 million, of which over 80% live in rural areas. Uttar Pradesh is also one of the&#13;
poorest states in India, with an annual per capita income in 1991-92 of only Rs. 4,012 ( current&#13;
prices), 29% below the average for the country. In 1988, an estimated 41.2% of the population&#13;
was below the poverty line, a proportion surpassed only in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa.&#13;
1.11     Hydrology. The Gangetic alluvial plain, situated between the Himalayan zone in the&#13;
north and the Bundelkhand and Vindhayan Regions in the south of Uttar Pradesh contains the&#13;
richest and the largest water resources. A series of aquifer horizons underlie it within the&#13;
maximum achieved drilling depth of 750 meters. Individual aquifer systems vary in thickness from&#13;
30-100 meters. There are also extensive entrapped brackish to saline aquifers in depths of 180-&#13;
250 meters in the region. In the north, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks underlie the rugged&#13;
Himalayan zone, and groundwater occurs in isolated patches and emerges in numerous perennial&#13;
springs. The Vindhayan and Bundelkhand Regions in the south have sand, limestone and granite&#13;
formations with very poor groundwater resources. In the regions between the plains and the&#13;
Himalayan zone are sub-zones created by sediments of emerging streams from the Himalayas that,&#13;
in general, have good ground-water resources.&#13;
1.12     Rivers. The whole of Uttar Pradesh lies in the catchment area of the Ganges, which&#13;
divides the state into northern and southern parts. At the Bangladeshi border, the Ganges&#13;
discharges at average 38,000 cubic meters per second at peak and 2,000 cubic meters per second&#13;
at the low flows. The Rivers Chambal, Betwa, and Yamuna are major tributaries from the&#13;
southern side of Ganga, and Ramganga and Gomti Rivers are from the northern side. All these&#13;
major rivers have perennial flows.&#13;
1.13     Climate. The climate in Uttar Pradesh is subtropical except in the Himalayas, where it&#13;
approaches the humid, temperate type. Average maximum temperatures in May vary between&#13;
43°C in the south and 33°C in the north, and average minimum temperatures in January vary&#13;
between 20C in the south to below zero in the hill regions in the north. Monsoon rains start in&#13;
mid-June and end mid-September. They come from either south east or south west. The normal&#13;
rainfall ranges from 550-3300 mm. The lowest rainfall areas are those in the belt, formed by the&#13;
districts from Mathura, Agra and Jalaum with only 600-800 mm. annually, followed by the belt in&#13;
the south, stretching from Jhansi to Allahabad with 800-1000 mm., then the belt in the south east&#13;
stretching from Sonebhadra to Deoria with 1000-1200 mm. The hill area in the north receives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1400-1600 mm: but the Dehradun and Nainital districts have over 1600 mm. At higher elevations&#13;
there is snowfall in winter.&#13;
1.14     Uttar Pradesh was one of the first states to provide at least one safe drinking water&#13;
source for all villages. However, water consumption is still quite low, particularly during the dry&#13;
seasons, and there are strong regional differences within Uttar Pradesh. Out of a total of 275,000&#13;
habitations or 112,566 revenue villages (villages) in Uttar Pradesh, some 12% are still not&#13;
covered, and over 38% are only partially covered. Only about 15% of the habitations are provided&#13;
with piped water systems. Multi-village piped water systems face many operational problems, and&#13;
many of the villages they are intended to serve do not receive water at all. These systems also&#13;
need rehabilitation and augmentation to cope with population growth.&#13;
1.15     Sanitation levels are below the national average, with 2.5% of the population using&#13;
latrines. Many of the latrines built under government programs are not being used by the&#13;
villagers. Apart from low availability of water, a target-oriented, top-down delivery system has&#13;
been the main reason for the inappropriate supply of facilities. There is lack of proper drainage in&#13;
most villages, and household wastewater on village pathways, lanes, and streets is a common&#13;
sight. Furthermore, in most villages no effective system of garbage or cattle-dung disposal is&#13;
followed.&#13;
Sector Organization&#13;
1.16     Under India's constitution, rural water supply and environmental sanitation are state&#13;
governments' responsibility. However, the GOI does have an important function in setting the&#13;
general policy direction and providing funds and technical assistance through the Ministry of&#13;
Rural Areas and Employment. State-government-led delivery systems generally fit into three&#13;
generic models: (a) Model 1: Fully state-run. A single state-owned agency or a government&#13;
department (e.g., Kerala Water Authority, Public Health Engineering Departments of Punjab and&#13;
Haryana, UP Jal Nigam and Jal Sansthans of Uttar Pradesh); (b) Model 2: Partly state-run. A&#13;
large government organization carries out planning, construction, and O&amp;M, but the local or&#13;
district government institutions for single/multi village schemes (e.g., Maharashtra Water Supply&#13;
and Sewerage Board, Zilla Parishads and Gram Panchayats) oversee O&amp;M; and (c) Model 3:&#13;
Decentralized system. Here a small state level agency is responsible for macro-planning and&#13;
formulation of the state budget, but district governments carry out micro-planning and&#13;
construction, and the Gram Panchayats (e.g., Kamataka Public Health Engineering Department,&#13;
Zilla Parishad and Gram Panchayats), O&amp;M. In the three models both Central and State&#13;
Governments finance 100% of the capital costs and subsidize O&amp;M. The involvement of&#13;
voluntary organizations or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in water supply delivery is&#13;
still only marginal in India.&#13;
1.17     Responsibility for sanitation is usually shared by several government agencies, but&#13;
details vary from state to state. Typically, the Departments of Rural Development and/or&#13;
Panchayati Raj are responsible for carrying out low-cost sanitation programs. The Gram&#13;
Panchayats plan and institute sullage drainage programs generally with the funds received from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
the Government under the Jawahar Rojgar Yojana (JRY) Program5. At the field level, multi-&#13;
purpose workers and health guides under the Health and Medical Departments are responsible for&#13;
environmental improvements and health education. The NGO community also plays an active&#13;
role in rural health and sanitation in a number of states. Under the 73rd Constitutional&#13;
Amendment Act, 1992, responsibility for the management and operation of rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation is to be devolved to the Gram Panchayats.&#13;
1.18     A government agency, the Central Groundwater Board under the Ministry of Water&#13;
Resources, is responsible for the production of water resource inventories and maps, and for the&#13;
monitoring of groundwater levels and rates of depletion. The Ministry of Health supports a&#13;
number of health education programs, but the prevention of water-related diseases has not been a&#13;
priority during the past decade.&#13;
1.19     Uttar Pradesh. There are five departments concerned with rural water supply,&#13;
sanitation, health education, and watershed development programs in Uttar Pradesh: the&#13;
Departments of Urban Development, Rural Development, Panchayati Raj, Health and Family&#13;
Welfare, and Agriculture, respectively. All rural water supply programs are under the Department&#13;
of Urban Development and are carried out through the UP Jal Nigam. The three Regional Jal&#13;
Sansthans (Kumaon, Garhwal and Bundelkhand) maintain and operate rural water supply systems&#13;
for hills and Bundelkhand regions, and UP Jal Nigam does so in the remaining districts and also&#13;
maintains over 200,000 handpumps in the State. The overall standard of O&amp;M is low. Under the&#13;
Rural Development Department at the district level, the Chief Development Officer coordinates&#13;
and monitors all developmental activities in the district, including rural water supply. The&#13;
Department of Panchayati Raj is responsible for constructing latrines in the rural areas of the state&#13;
through its field offices headed by the District Panchayat Raj Officers. UP Jal Nigam runs the&#13;
rural sanitation program under Dutch assistance. The State Health Education Bureau under the&#13;
Department of Medical, Health, and Family Welfare is responsible for health education. Under&#13;
the Department of Agriculture, the Soil Conservation Division oversees soil conservation, water&#13;
harvesting structures, and watershed development programs. Soil Conservation Units (one or&#13;
more in a district) are operational in every district. The District Soil Conservation Officer heads&#13;
these units. In addition to the Soil Conservation Division under the Department of Agriculture,&#13;
the Department of Minor Irrigation also carries out water sources recharge programs.&#13;
Government Policies and Programs&#13;
1.20  The GOI Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-97) gives highest priority to those villages without&#13;
an adequate number of safe water sources. However, increasing the service levels of those&#13;
villages covered with only one water source under previous plans and with supply levels of less&#13;
than 40 Ipcd gets equal importance. The plan stresses the following principles:&#13;
* water should be managed as a commodity;&#13;
5     A rural employment program (named after India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru) which is&#13;
primarily intended to generate additional employment for the unemployed and under employed, men and women,&#13;
in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
*  water supply should be based on effective demand, that is, standard of service&#13;
corresponds to willingness to pay;&#13;
*  local bodies should be free to levy charges to cover, as a minimum, O&amp;M costs with&#13;
eventual full cost recovery;&#13;
*  private sector should be mobilized for construction and O&amp;M of systems,&#13;
*  local organizations should be strengthened and assume full responsibility for O&amp;M of&#13;
systems; and&#13;
*  state governments should address the need for a comprehensive water management&#13;
plan to balance competing demands for water by irrigation, industry, and domestic use.&#13;
1.21     For sanitation, the Eighth Plan has adopted a new strategy of linking health education,&#13;
sanitation, and water supply and developing a demand-based approach to promoting latrine use.&#13;
The Eighth Plan also widens the definition of sanitation beyond latrine use to include personal&#13;
hygiene and the disposal of refuse and human water. Primary responsibility for the environmental&#13;
sanitation program has been given to district and village authorities.&#13;
1.22     In 1986, GOI set up a Technology Mission (renamed the Rajiv Gandhi National&#13;
Drinking Water Mission) to provide scientific and cost -effective content to the Accelerated Rural&#13;
Water Supply Program. The Government provides funding for sanitation through the Central&#13;
Rural Sanitation Program. State or Union Territory outlay for sanitation is through the Minimum&#13;
Needs Program under the Ministry of Rural Development. In the allocation of funds to villages,&#13;
priority is first given to "no source" villages, followed by those with water quality and/or quantity&#13;
(less than 40 lpcd) problems.&#13;
1.23     Of the total expenditures for rural water supply under the Eighth Plan, some 51% is&#13;
from GOI. The remainder is from state budgetary sources, with a small contribution (less than&#13;
5%) from foreign funding. The central and state allocations for rural sanitation are significantly&#13;
smaller.&#13;
1.24     Uttar Pradesh. The rural water supply and environmental sanitation policies and&#13;
strategies in the Uttar Pradesh Eighth Five Year Plan follow closely those of GOI. Villages that&#13;
have not been previously provided with adequate safe water sources get priority. Recognizing the&#13;
growing demand for house connections in rural areas, piped water supply schemes would be&#13;
designed to allow for service levels up to 70 Ipcd. The proposed allocation for rural water supply&#13;
and sanitation in Uttar Pradesh's Eighth Five Year Plan is about Rs. 7,200 million, including funds&#13;
from GOI, the state government, and IBRD under the proposed project and bilateral assistance&#13;
from the Netherlands.&#13;
Sectoral Issues&#13;
1.25     Policy reform is urgently required, in particular to: (a) replace the current supply-&#13;
driven approach that results in inefficient service delivery and poor quality of construction with a&#13;
demand-driven approach where decision-making responsibility is given to beneficiaries; (b)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
integrate rural water supply, environmental sanitation, environmental management, catchment&#13;
protection, and health and hygiene; (c) introduce cost recovery to increase sector sustainability;&#13;
and (d) develop a state water resource management policy.&#13;
1.26     Adoption of a Demand-Driven Approach to Service Delivery. In most states,&#13;
including Uttar Pradesh, the planning, design, and construction of water facilities are the&#13;
responsibility of centralized public sector agencies, such as the Public Health and Engineering&#13;
Departments and Water Boards. Water supply schemes are typically designed to satisfy the norm&#13;
of 40 lpcd and do not take into account user preferences, needs, demand, and willingness to pay&#13;
for different service levels or of future demand from increasing incomes and/or expectations. This&#13;
results in wasted investments because the augmentation, rehabilitation, and replacement of&#13;
existing systems to accommodate these demands can be extremely costly. Lack of accountability&#13;
of the service provider to users also results in poor design, construction, and costly overall service&#13;
delivery.&#13;
1.27     Alternative systems for planning and delivering services that take into account user&#13;
demand and preferences are needed. Experience with community participation in water supply&#13;
and sanitation through the programs of donors, NGOs and other countries and regions indicate&#13;
that community involvement can improve the sustainability of investments. Community-based&#13;
organizational structures, such as village water groups, would enable users to express their&#13;
preferences and set tariff rates and other community contributions. In practical terms, this implies&#13;
more flexibility in the design of water systems to accommodate individual preferences and&#13;
willingness to pay. Similarly, communities would take a more active role in the management of&#13;
the O&amp;M of such facilities, thus improving sustainability. However, organizing community&#13;
participation on a large scale for multi-village schemes is difficult and requires further work.&#13;
1.28     Integration of Rural Water Supply, Environmental Sanitation, Environmental&#13;
Management, Catchment Protection, and Health and Hygiene. An integrated approach&#13;
towards water supply, environmental sanitation, and health and hygiene is necessary to maximize&#13;
the health benefits to the population. While water supply has been given a high priority in India,&#13;
fewer resources have been allocated for environmental sanitation or to develop awareness about&#13;
the link between health and hygiene. Without proper sullage drainage facilities, the increased&#13;
volume of wastewater resulting from improvements in water supply will contribute to a high&#13;
incidence of water-borne diseases. This lack of integration in service delivery stems in part from&#13;
the existing institutional framework that channels assistance for rural water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation through separate progranis. Moreover, sullage drainage projects in&#13;
villages are undertaken as part of a general program of community improvement such as the JRY&#13;
Program, with the resulting work typically being poorly designed and executed. The&#13;
implementation of this approach requires modifications in the existing institutional and funding&#13;
arrangements for these services.&#13;
1.29     Introduction of Cost Recovery. At present, water supply systems are provided by&#13;
the Government based on the norm of 40 Ipcd, with 100% grant financing. Systems are typically&#13;
designed to meet this norm (handpumps and standposts) and do not take into account the demand&#13;
for higher levels of service (private connections). In reality, economically better-off households&#13;
usually have private connections. Since their consumption is much greater than 40 Ipcd, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
poor at the end of the distribution system receive little or no water. As a result, better- off&#13;
households indirectly benefit from subsidies intended for the poor. Such systems are likely to fail&#13;
because they are not designed for house connections. The basic systems usually provide few&#13;
opportunities for expansion. Past under-designing of rural water supply systems and increasing&#13;
population growth will require relatively large investments that govemment, faced with competing&#13;
priorities and fiscal constraints, will be unable to mobilize. Given the magnitude of demand and&#13;
the limitations of public resources, there is a need to ensure that the subsidy is limited and well-&#13;
targeted to the poor.&#13;
1.30     In most states in India, including Uttar Pradesh, cost recovery for the O&amp;M of rural&#13;
water supply schemes is unacceptably low. In all of the states, capital investment costs are&#13;
financed from central and state funds. Lack of political will to promote cost recovery, poor&#13;
water supply service, and the notion that water is a "public good" have been used to justify fully&#13;
subsidized services. Handpumps and standposts, which are water sources for the low income&#13;
groups, have been provided through grants from Central and State Governments. Policies for&#13;
cost recovery apply only to O&amp;M expenditures for piped schemes; revenues collected come&#13;
primarily from private connections and industrial and commercial users. Local government&#13;
agencies undertake collection of water charges in many states. It is thus difficult to estimate the&#13;
actual levels of collection, but indications are that it is very low.&#13;
1.31     For sullage drainage, the Gram Panchayats construct facilities with JRY funds. Thus,&#13;
the beneficiaries do not share in the investment costs for sullage drainage works. In contrast to&#13;
water and drainage, where primary infrastructure is commonly shared by the community,&#13;
individual households contract for latrines. Subsidies of up to 80% of the cost of constructing&#13;
latrines to the plinth level is provided to socio-economically weaker households. People are often&#13;
unaware of available low-cost technologies, making them hesitant to pay for latrines. Creating&#13;
awareness of options is important in stimulating demand for this service.&#13;
1.32     State Water Resource Management Policy. Excessive mining of groundwater has&#13;
led to reduced yields or drying up of wells in certain parts of India, including Uttar Pradesh. The&#13;
reported number of failed wells in the entire country is over 14 million, and the unplanned&#13;
exploitation of groundwater may increase this number further in the years to come. A policy to&#13;
guide public decisions on control and regulation of water resource allocation and associated&#13;
investment programs is needed to ensure that the objectives of efficiency, environmental&#13;
sustainability, economy, and poverty alleviation are adequately addressed.&#13;
External Financing of Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation&#13;
1.33     A number of donors ( UNICEF, DANIDA, the Netherlands, UNDP, SIDA, ODA,&#13;
KFW and EEC) have assisted the development of rural water supply in India. The financing made&#13;
available by these donors, however, has been fairly small in terms of the overall investment&#13;
program in the country. UNICEF has been one of the most influential through its assistance for&#13;
the development of the India Mark II handpump and its maintenance system, and for a tubewell&#13;
drilling program. Further research and development of India Mark II resulted in an improved&#13;
model, the India Mark III. The UNDP/World Bank Global Water and Sanitation Program with&#13;
UNICEF, DANIDA, and The Netherlands have supported rural water supply programs in a few&#13;
states (Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat) with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
emphasis on an integrated approach to water supply, sanitation and health education, and&#13;
community-based approaches. The Technology Advisory Group of the UNDP/World Bank&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program successflilly developed and promoted low-cost, twin-pit-pour-flush&#13;
latrine technology in India. All these initiatives have influenced the government's sector policies&#13;
in varying degrees.&#13;
Bank's Prior Experience in India&#13;
1.34      The Bank has financed fourteen projects in the urban and rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation sector. Of these, six are active with two in rural water supply and sanitation. Further,&#13;
more than half of the investments financed under urban projects have had some rural water supply&#13;
and sanitation. In general, World Bank assistance for the sector has gone for particularly difficult&#13;
areas that could not be tackled under the Government's own programs because of their high per&#13;
capita investment costs. Although the Bank's combined outlay of about Rs. 7,500 million under&#13;
its two ongoing rural water supply and sanitation projects in Karnataka and Maharashtra (see&#13;
para. 1. 35)6 is small compared to GOI's outlay, at the state level these projects have helped&#13;
introduce cost recovery policy reforms, an integrated approach to service delivery, and&#13;
strengthening of community-based management of water supply and sanitation investments.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Past Bank Lending&#13;
1.35      To maximize health benefits, the Bank's two ongoing projects provide an integrated&#13;
program of rural water supply, community participation-health education, and environmental&#13;
sanitation. To promote sustainability, project design has provided for beneficiary participation in&#13;
the planning, construction and O&amp;M phases of the projects; training and institutional&#13;
strengthening; improved construction quality, and support of policy initiatives to decentralize&#13;
service delivery to the lowest appropriate level (the 73rd Constitutional Amendment).&#13;
1.36      Experience from these two projects has been mixed. In Maharashtra, the Government&#13;
adopted some features of the project design in its own program (introducing capital cost sharing,&#13;
permitting private connections, improved procurement procedures, and construction supervision&#13;
practices). However, project supervision reports that the project indicates many deviations from&#13;
original plans:&#13;
(a)    schemes were constructed without community participation,&#13;
(b)   the environmental sanitation and health education activities were&#13;
perpetually delayed;&#13;
(c)   the Project Management Unit (PMU) was inadequately staffed, and staff&#13;
did not possess the necessary skills and resisted using private sector&#13;
resources,&#13;
6      Karnataka Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project (Credit 2483-IN) approved by the&#13;
Board on April 20, 1993 and effective on February 23, 1994. Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Environmental&#13;
Sanitation Project (Credit 2234-IN), approved on May 2, 1991 and effective on July 31, 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
(d)   the nodal Rural Development Department did not have management&#13;
capacity to implement a project of this size and complexity;&#13;
(e)   bureaucratic delays and insufficient counterpart funds were a regular&#13;
feature; and&#13;
(f)   the District Project Management Units (DPM-Us) were not set up.&#13;
1.37        In Karnataka, the project's policy and institutional sustainability objectives are&#13;
being fully adopted. However, it is too early to judge if the project can achieve its objectives&#13;
because project implementation only began in 1994. Both the pilot and Phase 1 of the project&#13;
have achieved meaningful popular participation, an integrated approach, cost recovery policies,&#13;
and user management of services. The main problems pertain to delays in procurement, decision&#13;
making, and preparation of engineering designs for Phase 2. The Government's failure to fully&#13;
staff the District Level PMUs may affect the project's performance.&#13;
1.38     Building on past experiences, the proposed project will seek to:&#13;
O  develop a coherent community participation approach that provides for a major&#13;
decision-making role for the communities in the identification, planning, design,&#13;
construction and O&amp;M of schemes;&#13;
o  enhance the role of women, the key stakeholders in the sector, by focusing the&#13;
community development activities of the project on them;&#13;
3  introduce partial capital cost recovery and full cost recovery for O&amp;M; and&#13;
o  integrate water supply service delivery with environmental sanitation by developing&#13;
beneficiary awareness of the link between health and sanitation.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Support and Link to the CAS&#13;
1.39     The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India is dated May 17, 1995 and&#13;
was discussed at the Board on June 20, 1995. It focuses on the need for state-level reform&#13;
interventions. It recognizes the important role played by the states in India's development&#13;
process, and the fiscal problems and institutional weaknesses faced by state governments in&#13;
carrying out development programs. Sector lending should therefore support the long-term,&#13;
state-level reform process.&#13;
1.40     The CAS states that Bank assistance will be channeled to areas where it can directly&#13;
alleviate poverty and accelerate the development of human resources. It also states that poverty&#13;
reduction, private sector development, environmental protection, increasing the role of&#13;
beneficiaries and support organizations (SOs) in project design and implementation, and enabling&#13;
women to participate more fully in the development process are all important objectives of the&#13;
Bank's activities in India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
1.41     Bank support for the proposed project would allow GOUP to initiate the necessary&#13;
state-level sector reform process to meet the CAS objectives and put into practice similar&#13;
important principles stated in GOI's Eighth Plan. The proposed project supports the CAS by&#13;
initiating efficient and economic service delivery, increasing user financing of drinking water and&#13;
environmental sanitation facilities, and supporting development of an alternative, more demand-&#13;
driven and user-responsive service delivery mechanism. The proposed project will pilot-test an&#13;
innovative approach to service delivery that includes participatory decision making.&#13;
1.42     During project preparation, GOUP has pursued policy reforms such as the&#13;
introduction of capital cost-sharing from beneficiaries, the provision of differentiated service&#13;
levels based on demand, and the transfer of policy formulation responsibility for the rural water&#13;
supply sector from the Urban Development Department to the Rural Development Department.&#13;
Finally, GOUP has proposed a major policy study for a 10-1 5 year strategic plan that will identify&#13;
and define further major policy reforms required for the sector.&#13;
Il. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Origin&#13;
2.01      Project identification began in 1989. In March 1991, GOUP sent a preliminary project&#13;
proposal to the Bank. The project was then intended to cover some 3,000 villages from twenty-&#13;
eight districts at an estimated cost of about US$135 million. Though the Bank was supportive of&#13;
the project approach, project preparation stalled during 1991-1993 because of disagreements over&#13;
major policy and institutional issues.&#13;
2.02      As part of project preparation, the Bank required completion of a small pilot project to&#13;
test the feasibility of the tentatively agreed upon capital cost recovery policy and participatory&#13;
approach. The pilot project demonstrated that: (a) the project design was weak because it did not&#13;
promote a coherent demand-driven and participatory approach to service delivery; (b) the&#13;
introduction of a cost recovery policy required a significantly different service delivery mechanism&#13;
than the existing one or the one proposed under the project; (c) the performance of the sector&#13;
could not be improved unless the failures of the existing service delivery mechanism were fully&#13;
addressed; and (d) significant policy work and reforms were needed to improve sector&#13;
performance.&#13;
2.03      Pre-appraisal took place in December 1995. By then the project design had been&#13;
significantly revised to support a more demand-driven approach, and a fully participatory process&#13;
in service delivery. It was also agreed that new service delivery mechanisms needed to be&#13;
developed and tested before committing large resources to an investment program. The project&#13;
was reduced to cover only 1,000 villages from the areas most in need in the hills, foothills, and&#13;
Bundelkhand regions. A major policy study was to identify the issues affecting sector&#13;
performance and recommend policy reforms that would be implemented as part of a 10-15 year&#13;
strategic plan. The strategic plan would be formulated in consultation with the Bank, and could&#13;
constitute the policy framework for subsequent investments by the Bank.&#13;

2.04     The project-supported Statewide Media Campaign on gender and sanitation issues will&#13;
cover the entire State of Uttar Pradesh. The Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation&#13;
component of the project, however, would cover about 1,000 villages, with a present population&#13;
of about 0.8 million and a design population of 1.2 million distributed in fifteen districts, nine&#13;
(Dehradun, Tehri, Chamoli, Pauri, Pithoragarh, Uttarkashi, Nainital, Udham Singh Nagar, and&#13;
Almora) in hill and foothill areas in the north and six districts (Jhansi, Lalitpur, Banda, Hamirpur,&#13;
Mahoba, and Jalaun) in the Bundelkhand region in the south of the State.&#13;
Project Development Objectives&#13;
2.05     The project has two main objectives. The first objective is to deliver sustainable health&#13;
and hygiene benefits to the rural population through improvements in water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation services, which will increase rural incomes through time savings and&#13;
income opportunities for women, test an alternative to the current supply driven service delivery&#13;
mechanism and promote sanitation and gender awareness. This will be achieved by strengthening&#13;
the operation of the project management unit and by investing in the selection and construction of&#13;
water supply and environmental sanitation facilities for single and regional schemes. The second&#13;
objective is to promote the long-term sustainability of the rural water supply and sanitation sector&#13;
by providing assistance to GOUP to identify and implement an appropriate policy framework and&#13;
strategic plan. This will be done through sectoral studies and sectoral development and special&#13;
studies, as required, to improve the capacity of the sector to deliver services.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
2.06     The project would support a package of investments and a process of policy reform to&#13;
deliver sustainable health and hygiene benefits to the rural population. The investments are&#13;
designed to test various policy options and to improve knowledge, attitude and practices about&#13;
the linkages between health and hygiene; provide higher water supply service levels (quantity,&#13;
quality, reliability, equity and access); and to improve environment through satisfactory disposal&#13;
of human waste. In addition, to ensure that the investments are sustainable, the project would&#13;
follow a demand-driven approach to service delivery. Since most communities lack the&#13;
organizational and technical skills to design and construct schemes on their own, communities&#13;
will be assisted by SOs (NGOs, community-based organizations, and private sector firms). The&#13;
project would also support a major policy study whose objective would be to help GOUP identify&#13;
the issues affecting sector performance and formulate appropriate policy reforms. The policy&#13;
reforms would provide the framework for a 10-15 year sector strategic plan that would identify&#13;
individual policy reform decisions and their timing, and define the corresponding package of&#13;
investments required for the sector. The strategic plan and GOUP's commitment to its&#13;
implementation would also provide the background for future Bank support to the sector. A&#13;
detailed description of the project is given at Annex 1. The three components of the project are&#13;
summarized below:&#13;
* Strengthening and operation of the Project Management Unit (US$8.31 million&#13;
or 12% of total project costs). The PMU would be responsible for overseeing the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
project. Funding would be provided through the project to support operating and&#13;
capital costs for the PMU and its DPMUs. This component would finance all PMU&#13;
and DPMW materials and equipment, all recurrent costs, training, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, technical assistance and audit costs. It would also finance capacity-&#13;
building training for SOs and service agencies.&#13;
* Selection and construction of water supply and environmental sanitation&#13;
facilities for single and regional schemes (US$60.21 million or 85% of total project&#13;
costs). This component would finance improvements of water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation services for 1,000 communities serving about 1.2 million&#13;
people. Single schemes are for one or two villages, and regional schemes are for more&#13;
than two villages. This component would include community development activities&#13;
and the construction of water supply and environmental sanitation schemes.&#13;
Community development activities would promote the active participation of the&#13;
communities in all stages of decision making for the planning, construction, and&#13;
management of their scheme, to increase local ownership and effective use and&#13;
sustainability. These capacity-building activities would include community&#13;
mobilization and organization through workshops, group discussions, information&#13;
campaigns, participatory community action planning, and non-formal education and&#13;
hygiene and environmental sanitation awareness training. Women's development&#13;
initiatives include orientation and training to help women develop skills required to&#13;
realize the health and hygiene benefits of improved water supply, improve their access&#13;
to the formal credit system, plan and carry out water supply and environmental&#13;
sanitation schemes including environmental resource enhancement initiatives, and&#13;
participate in resource mobilization activities, such as the collection of user charges&#13;
and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Construction of water supply and environmental sanitation schemes includes:&#13;
*  financing for surveys, design, and provision of construction assistance;&#13;
*  construction, augmentation, and rehabilitation of water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation schemes, including spring and stream gravity,&#13;
tubewells with handpumps or electric pumps, and stream pumping;&#13;
*  protection of the catchment area through activities including the establishment&#13;
of tree nurseries, reforestation, alternative energy sources to fuel wood,&#13;
erosion control, and other site specific programs;&#13;
*  construction of village drains;&#13;
* construction of demonstration and household human waste disposal facilities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
*  carrying out of environmental management activities including construction of&#13;
filtration structures for community ponds, solid waste disposal, and mosquito&#13;
and fly control; and&#13;
*  monitoring of construction activities. The design criteria for these&#13;
technologies are described in Annex 2.&#13;
* Studies and sector development (US$2.46 million or 3% of total project costs).&#13;
This component would support preparation of a water supply and environmental&#13;
sanitation policy and long-term strategic plan, preparation of a development plan for&#13;
regional schemes, a major statewide awareness campaign on sanitation and gender&#13;
issues, a water-quality and leak-detection study, preparation of a follow-up project, a&#13;
study on expanding technology options for rural water supply and environmental&#13;
sanitation, and special studies, as required, to improve the capacity of the sector to&#13;
deliver services. At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that the water-quality and&#13;
leak-detection study and the study on expanding technology options for rural water&#13;
supply and environmental sanitation will be carried out in accordance with terms of&#13;
reference agreed with the Bank. An assurance was also obtained that study findings&#13;
will be discussed with the Bank by June 30, 2000, and June 30, 2001, respectively.&#13;
Terms of reference for the other studies have been prepared (Annex 3).&#13;
2.07     An estimated 70% of the water to be piped and used under this proposed project will&#13;
be groundwater, and 30% will be surface water to be drawn from existing springs, rivulets,&#13;
irrigation dams and canals, and, in a few cases, rivers that are tributaries of the Ganges. The&#13;
villages where the 30% surface water will be used are located upstream from barrages that divert&#13;
water into existing irrigation schemes. This diverted water that will be used for the project. The&#13;
proposed project, therefore, will not use water that contributes directly to the low flow of the&#13;
Ganges.&#13;
2.08     Because a large number of project beneficiaries are expected to be tribal people, and&#13;
the project supports a participatory process that encourages the active participation of all&#13;
community members, a tribal development plan is not needed in accordance with paragraph 13 of&#13;
Operational Directive 4.20. No resettlement for single schemes will take place under the project,&#13;
and only minimal land acquisition is anticipated. Land acquisition for single schemes would be&#13;
done on a voluntary basis through an agreement satisfactory to the Bank between the land&#13;
occupant and the Village Water and Sanitation Committee (VWSC). As part of the project, a&#13;
development plan for regional schemes will be prepared. The development plan will include a&#13;
policy framework for addressing negative project impacts on affected persons, in conformity with&#13;
the Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 on Resettlement. At negotiations, an assurance was&#13;
obtained to this effect.&#13;
2.09     A PMNU has been created to manage the project and will be assisted by seven DPMUs.&#13;
The project would finance the operations of both the PMU and the DPMUs. The PMU/DPMU&#13;
would have no direct service delivery responsibilities but would sub-contract these responsibilities&#13;
to SOs and communities being assisted. Through grants, the PMIJ would allocate resources to&#13;
selected partnerships between SOs and communities to finance the construction of rural water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
supply and environmental sanitation schemes. The project would emphasize building the capacity&#13;
of local communities to lead the decision-making process in all phases of scheme identification,&#13;
design, construction, operation, and maintenance. The project would thus support activities to&#13;
promote participation of community members, particularly women, at all stages of the scheme&#13;
cycle The PMU would ensure that SOs and schemes meet agreed eligibility criteria, provide&#13;
funding to the partnerships between SOs and communities, and monitor performance. To keep its&#13;
staffing down to a few highly qualified staff, the PMU would be assisted by service agencies.&#13;
Service agencies are apex or resource NGOs and firms, training organizations, and other private&#13;
or professional associations or entities with the requisite qualifications. Service agencies would&#13;
be used to build overall capacities and provide training, some monitoring, all auditing of SOs and&#13;
PMU/DPMUs, all studies, and other specialized services and expertise.&#13;
2. 10    Role of women. Women are the main users and managers of water resources. They&#13;
influence family sanitary habits through their central role in family hygiene, child care, and food&#13;
preparation. Because women are the ones who fetch water, they value improvements in water&#13;
supplies more than men and so have a vested interest in keeping the systems functioning.&#13;
Primarily women and female children carry water and it is one of the most arduous tasks in rural&#13;
areas of Uttar Pradesh. Women are responsible for all household chores related to water such as&#13;
collecting and storing it, taking care of sources and distribution points, and working to construct&#13;
them. Women also decide whether or not to use a specific water point, given its distance and&#13;
accessibility. They do not participate much in development, however, because household&#13;
activities take up too much time, there is a low level of awareness, and they have limited control&#13;
over resources The project implementation strategy would focus on strengthening the role of&#13;
women in all stages of scheme cycle to increase their capacity and to ensure they fully participate&#13;
in project benefits. A summary of the social assessment findings is presented in Annex 4.&#13;
2. I1    The community development activities of the Water Supply and Environmental&#13;
Sanitation Schemes component will promote the role of women in five important areas: (a)&#13;
wvomen will be guaranteed representation in VWSCs, which must have at least 30% women&#13;
members, (b) hygiene and environmental sanitation awareness and non-formal education activities&#13;
will focus on women, (c) women will be encouraged to take advantage of the women's&#13;
development initiatives program, which would provide specific skill and management training to&#13;
increase the scope of income-generating activities and would help women gain access to formal&#13;
credit systems; (d) women will be encouraged to form female tapstand groups to collect monthly&#13;
operation and maintenance fees and to maintain tapstands, and (e) the selection of female scheme&#13;
maintenance workers will be encouraged. Women will be trained in operation and maintenance,&#13;
including collection of user fees, monitoring, and reporting.&#13;
2.12     Community Participation. The basis for community participation is a legal&#13;
representative and responsive VWSC elected by all the project beneficiaries within a village. The&#13;
project focuses on providing the means for users to take the lead in decision-making at critical&#13;
stages, in carrying out their decisions, and in collective sharing of benefits. To involve users in&#13;
their schemes the community action planning process provides opportunities for small groups of&#13;
villagers to investigate, analyze problems, resolve conflicts, and build consensus. The process&#13;
builds confidence among women and disadvantaged groups who otherwise would shy away from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
expressing their opinions in large groups or in front of authoritative figures. The project design&#13;
enables women to have a larger role in the analysis of their water supply and sanitation problems,&#13;
in identifying least-cost solutions to these problems, and in carrying out and managing their rural&#13;
water supply and environmental sanitation schemes.&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
2.13      The total cost of the project, including taxes and duties and physical and price&#13;
contingencies is estimated at Rs.3,007.6 million or US$71.0 million equivalent. The foreign&#13;
exchange component is Rs. 74.1 million (US$1.9 million), or about 3% of total project cost.&#13;
Taxes and duties are estimated at Rs. 165.7 million (US$3.9 million), or about 5% of total project&#13;
cost.&#13;
2.14      The base cost estimates reflect prices in January 1996 and were based on actual cost of&#13;
recent similar work carried out. Total contingencies amount to Rs. 930.1 million (US$ 11.1&#13;
million) or about 15% of the total project cost and include physical contingencies of 10% on civil&#13;
works and price contingencies of 10% of the total project cost, respectively. To provide for&#13;
inflation during project implementation, the following escalation rates have been used: (a) for&#13;
local expenditures, 8.5% in FY1996, 8.0% in FY1997, 7.5% in FY1998, 7.0% in FY1999, and&#13;
6% thereafter; and (b) for foreign expenditures, 3.3% for FY1996, 2.3% for FY1997, and 2.5%&#13;
thereafter. Foreign exchange conversions have been calculated in accordance with World Bank&#13;
guidelines, using projections prevailing at the time of appraisal. A summary of cost estimates is&#13;
given in Table 2.1. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Annex 5.&#13;

of total project costs, including taxes and duties. The Loan would be made available to GOI,&#13;
which would make the proceeds available to the GOUP in accordance with GOI's standard&#13;
arrangements for developmental assistance to the states of India. The balance of the financing of&#13;
the total project costs will be in the form of a community contribution of about US$7.6 million,&#13;
equivalent to about 11% of total project cost and a GOUP grant to the PMU of about US$3.8&#13;
million, equivalent to about 5% of total project cost. The community contributions may be in&#13;
cash or kind. The financing plan is provided in Table 2.2 below:&#13;

HI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Status of Project Preparation&#13;
3.01    Project preparation was partly financed by a Japanese Grant Facility. Preparatory&#13;
activities have permitted the creation of a PMU, completion of an assessment of SOs, definition of&#13;
village and SO eligibility criteria, identification of twenty-one eligible SOs, preparation of a social&#13;
assessment and preparation of a draft Implementation Manual that defines all PMU/DPMU&#13;
operating procedures. The draft Implementation Manual consists of: (a) an operations manual&#13;
including a PMU/DPMU accounting manual and an SO accounting manual; (b) a training manual;&#13;
(c) a monitoring and evaluation manual; (d) a technology manual; and (e) a standard prices and&#13;
rates schedule. In addition, detailed engineering designs for over 200 schemes have been&#13;
prepared and used to estimate project costs.&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
3.02    A PMU was created on November 7, 1994, as a society under the Society Registration&#13;
Act and is responsible for overseeing implementation of the project. The PMU's Memorandum of&#13;
Association and Rules are presented at Annex 6. The Department of Rural Development will be&#13;
the line department for the PMU.&#13;
3.03    PMU is governed by a general body which meets once a year, and an executive&#13;
committee which meets at least once every quarter, and is responsible for approving PMU's by-&#13;
laws, annual budgets and programs, and overseeing PMIJ operations. Detailed PMU operating&#13;
procedures are defined within the PMU Implementation Manual. At negotiations, an assurance&#13;
was obtained that the completion by PMNU of a technology manual, under the Implementation&#13;
Manual, satisfactory to the Bank, will be a condition for disbursements for schemes.&#13;
3.04    The PMU is headed by a director and organized into five units: operations, monitoring&#13;
and evaluation; human resources development and communications; technology; finance and&#13;
administration, and management information systems. The PMU organizational structure appears&#13;
in Annex 7. PMIU will employ a total of thirteen higher level staff (including three long-term&#13;
local consultants for the positions of monitoring and evaluation specialist, women's development&#13;
specialist, and training and communications specialist) and seventeen support staff. Two long-&#13;
term international advisers focusing on the project's community development component and on&#13;
technical issues will assist the unit.&#13;
3.05    The PMUJ will be responsible for reviewing the eligibility of proposals from SOs and&#13;
villages. A two-stage procedure will be used. First, PMU will constitute a Staff Appraisal&#13;
Committee, composed of six members (all PMU unit heads and for SO selection only, a&#13;
representative from the State Institute of Rural Development) that will review all SOs and village&#13;
proposals and will recommend the appropriate course of action (approval, rejection of a proposal,&#13;
or request for additional information). Second, the proposals will be forwarded to the Finance&#13;
Committee of the Executive Committee for final decision. The Finance Committee is chaired by&#13;
the Secretary of the Rural Development Department and includes representatives from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Finance Department, the Planning Department, and the PMU director. Project SOs will elect&#13;
their representatives to an advisory committee to the PMU.&#13;
3.06    The PMU will be assisted by seven DPMIJs. DPMUs will be responsible for close&#13;
monitoring of field activities. Four DPMUs will be set in the hills and foothills (Pithoraragarth,&#13;
Almora, Srinagar and Dehradun) and three in the Bundelkhand (Jhansi, Mahoba and Banda).&#13;
Each DPMU will employ four higher-level staff and three support staff. Higher-level staff include&#13;
a community development specialist, a sanitary engineer, a health and hygiene specialist, and an&#13;
environmental specialist.&#13;
3.07    To begin work on its first batch of 124 villages, the PMU has created three DPMUs&#13;
(Pithoragarth, Dehradun, and Jhansi). The DPMU organizational structure is presented in Annex&#13;
8.&#13;
Implementation Strategy&#13;
3.08    Project Implementation Period. The project would be implemented over six years,&#13;
with a completion date of November 30, 2001. Given the duration of project preparation, it was&#13;
agreed that retroactive financing would be recommended for twelve months prior to Loan&#13;
signing. The project emphasizes institutional development and testing of an alternative service&#13;
delivery mechanism. It therefore does not intend to achieve full coverage of water and&#13;
environmental sanitation throughout Uttar Pradesh but, instead, covers a six-year slice of sectoral&#13;
investments. Annex 9 shows the project implementation schedule.&#13;
3.09    Strategic Plan. A draft Strategic Plan has been prepared (Annex 10). The draft Plan&#13;
recommends, inter alia, the transfer of all policy-making authority and related budgets for the rural&#13;
water supply sector from the Department of Urban Development to the Department of Rural&#13;
Development. This transfer will take place in two stages. First, as of March 31, 1996, a GOUP&#13;
Order (Annex I 1) transferred responsibility for the rural water supply sector to a committee&#13;
headed by the Agriculture Production Commissioner and composed of the Principal Secretary,&#13;
Finance; the Secretary, Rural Development; the Secretary, Urban Development; the Secretary,&#13;
Secretariat Administration, and the Special Secretary Rural Development. Second, a GOUP&#13;
Order dated March 27, 1996, (Annex 12) transfered all policy-making responsibility and related&#13;
budgets and administration to the Rural Development Department as of April 1, 1997. At&#13;
negotiations, an assurance was obtained that GOLJP will, not later than April 1, 1997, complete&#13;
the transfer of responsibility for the rural water supply sector from the Department of Urban&#13;
Development to the Department of Rural Development.&#13;
3.10    The PMIJ will be responsible for overseeing the rural water supply and environmental&#13;
sanitation policy study to be carried out over a nine-month period. The findings of the policy&#13;
study will provide GOUP with the basis for revising and finalizing the Strategic Plan. At&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that GOUP will forward to the Bank for its review and&#13;
comments a draft final Strategic Plan no later than December 31, 1999 and that the Strategic Plan&#13;
will be finalized, taking into consideration the Bank's comments, by June 30, 2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.11    Selection and Construction of Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation&#13;
Schemes. Scheme selection will follow a demand-driven approach through which communities&#13;
would confirm need, economic viability, technical feasibility, sustainability, and willingness to pay&#13;
before they are selected for inclusion in the project. Given the estimated village dropout rate of&#13;
about 13%, the project will need to prepare 1,150 villages divided into four batches of 124, 276,&#13;
375, and 375, respectively, to finance the construction of schemes for at least 1,000 villages in&#13;
four batches of about 108, 242, 325, and 325 villages, respectively. SOs should be able to absorb&#13;
the management of this number of villages. These schemes will serve a current population of 0.8&#13;
million corresponding to a design population of 1.2 million. Regional schemes would be&#13;
considered for financing by the project only if the findings of the development plan (para 2.06) for&#13;
regional schemes confirm their economic, financial, and institutional feasibility. Assuming the&#13;
concept and design adopted for the project are successful, funding has been provided for a follow&#13;
up-project to be prepared toward the end of the project implementation period. The follow-up&#13;
project, if it materializes, would seek to apply the lessons learned from the proposed project,&#13;
provide a vehicle to implement newly adopted policy measures, and substantially increase rural&#13;
water supply and environmental sanitation service coverage.&#13;
3.12    To increase ownership and sustainability, the communities, assisted by SOs, will plan,&#13;
design, implement, operate, and maintain their schemes. Beneficiary communities would be&#13;
represented by a VWSC, which would be formed as a sub-committee of the Village Panchayat&#13;
under Section 29 (6) of the United Provinces Panchayati Raj Act 1947. GOUP has issued an&#13;
Order (Annex 13) outlining the modalities of VWSC's formation. Each committee will consist of&#13;
7-12 members (the specific number is to be decided by the community) who will be elected by the&#13;
community. The Order specifies that there should be a minimum of 30% women and 20%&#13;
scheduled caste or scheduled tribe members on the Committee. All decisions will need to be&#13;
made by a majority vote of all members. The VWSC chairman and secretary will also be elected&#13;
by the community. The Order specifies that the Committee can collect from villagers a voluntary&#13;
contribution towards the capital and O&amp;M costs of the scheme.&#13;
3.13    Scheme Cycle. The sequence of actions required from scheme identification to&#13;
completion has been defined within the detailed scheme cycle (Annex 14). The cycle takes into&#13;
account seasons, harvests, holidays, and their influence on site accessibility, water source yield&#13;
measurement, availability of labor, and conditions and timing for construction work. It also&#13;
considers the time needed to process proposals. The cycle would span 33 calendar months and&#13;
includes three main phases (pre-planning, planning, and implementation). The three main phases&#13;
of the cycle, their objectives, and implementation details are described below.&#13;
3.14    The pre-planning phase of the scheme cycle lasts about seven months and begins in&#13;
December. Its main objective is to identify SOs and schemes that meet eligibility criteria for a&#13;
planning phase contract. The pre-planning phase includes three main activities:&#13;
(a)   Pre-qualification of SOs. The PMU will identify SOs through a media campaign&#13;
that requests they forward their expression of interest. Once applications are&#13;
received the PMU would assess whether SOs meet the SO eligibility criteria (para&#13;
3.24). PMU would also make field visits to assess SO performance in previous&#13;
activities. Once the assessment is completed, the PMIU would hold a Staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Appraisal Committee meeting to carry out a final check on the compliance with&#13;
eligibility criteria before sending its recommendation (approval, rejection, or request&#13;
for additional information) to the Finance Committee (para 3.05) for final decision.&#13;
Pre-qualification requires about 2.5 months and is completed by early March of the&#13;
first year. At this stage the PMU assigns one of its staff to follow all future&#13;
contacts with pre-qualified SO. This person is called a portfolio manager.&#13;
(b)  Pre-feasibility study preparation and assessment: Prequalified SOs receive&#13;
orientation and training on how to prepare prefeasibility studies. They then prepare&#13;
and submit their prefeasibility studies to the PM`U/DPMU for screening. This&#13;
process requires about seven weeks and is completed by the first week of May of&#13;
the first year. The PMU site appraises the proposed schemes and confirms the&#13;
source yield measurement. The portfolio managers review the site appraisal, the&#13;
technology unit certifies the technical feasibility of the schemes, and a Staff&#13;
Appraisal Committee meeting is held to propose a list of schemes that meet&#13;
eligibility criteria (para 3.26) for final approval by the Finance Committee. This&#13;
activity requires about 3.5 months and is completed by early July of the first year&#13;
(c)   Signing of planning phase contract. After the Finance Committee approves the&#13;
list of schemes, the PMU starts a series of activities to facilitate SO preparation of&#13;
satisfactory planning phase proposals. These activities consist of SO training in&#13;
proposal preparation, screening and evaluating proposed SO staff, using a system of&#13;
orientation and training programs. The planning phase contracts between PMU and&#13;
the SOs are then prepared and signed. These activities require about one month&#13;
and are completed by the end of July.&#13;
3.15     The planning phase lasts about twelve months and begins in early August of the first&#13;
year. The cost of the planning phase is about US$6,200 per community, with an average&#13;
population of about 784 per community (equivalent to about US$7.90 per capita). The planning&#13;
phase contract is about US$3 1,000 per SO (assuming that, on average, each SO works with five&#13;
communities simultaneously). This includes financing for staff, overheads, and a small lump sum&#13;
to reimburse prequalified SOs for their preplanning costs (equivalent to about US$150 per&#13;
scheme). SO staff inputs per village will vary depending on scheme size and complexity. Project&#13;
support will include the salaries of a community facilitator and a community worker (one for each&#13;
village), a community development supervisor (for about 3-5 months per village), a junior&#13;
engineer or overseer (for 3-6 months per village), a senior engineer (for about 1-3 months per&#13;
village), an accountant and a team leader (each for about 0.5 months per village). SO staff input&#13;
is highest during the planning phase, which is used to assist in the preparation of an&#13;
implementation phase contract agreement. The planning phase includes the following activities:&#13;
(a)   Orientation and training for SO staff. This includes training on preparation of a&#13;
Community Action Plan to help communities prepare an implementation phase&#13;
proposal; on survey, design, costs, and construction technologies for technical&#13;
staff, and for community development supervisors and workers in health education.&#13;
These training activities require about two months and are completed by mid-&#13;
October of the first year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(b) Community action planning. Community development activities, including&#13;
training in hygiene and environmental sanitation awareness; non-formal education;&#13;
election of a VWSC; and a community needs assessment. Technical and service&#13;
level options are discussed. Women's development initiatives are discussed and a&#13;
plan prepared, a village environment action plan is discussed and prepared,&#13;
environmental sanitation activities are discussed and a plan prepared, the scheme&#13;
layout plan is prepared and an O&amp;M plan is discussed and prepared. These&#13;
activities require about five months and are completed by mid-February of the&#13;
second year.&#13;
(c)  Finalization of implementation phase proposal. The community cash&#13;
contribution is collected, the community action plan is finalized, the detailed design&#13;
is completed, and the implementation phase proposal is completed. A joint VWSC&#13;
and SO bank account is opened to receive implementation phase financing. The&#13;
PMU/DPMU carry out site appraisals, hold a Staff Technical Appraisal Committee&#13;
(STAC) meeting to review the implementation phase proposals' compliance with&#13;
scheme eligibility criteria, and sends its recommendation to the Finance Committee&#13;
for final decision. These activities require about five months and are completed by&#13;
mid-August of the second year.&#13;
3.16    The planning phase would lead to a representative and legally created VWSC, a&#13;
Community Action Plan that would form the basis for the implementation phase proposal, and&#13;
community contributions to capital cost. In cases that meet all PMU eligibility criteria, a contract&#13;
agreement among the VWSC, the PMU and the SO for implementation phase financing will also&#13;
be in place.&#13;
3.17    The payment terms in the planning phase contract have been arranged to permit close&#13;
monitoring of SO performance and early identification of problems. All payments are linked to&#13;
the completion of specific tasks. The first payment is an advance of 30% of the total contract&#13;
amount (equivalent to about US$9,000 per SO). It is conditional upon the signing of the planning&#13;
phase proposal, evidence that the SO has opened a separate bank account for the planning phase&#13;
activities, and evidence that all SO staff have been appointed.&#13;
3.18    The second payment of 40% of the contract amount (equivalent to about US$12,000&#13;
per SO) is conditional on evidence that SO staff are working, the community action planning has&#13;
been completed, hygiene and environmental sanitation awareness activities are underway, a&#13;
progress report has been submitted and tapstand committees are formed. A representative VWSC&#13;
must also must have been created, the community action plan and scheme layout plan have been&#13;
approved by the community, and non-formal education and women development initiatives have&#13;
started. In addition to its regular field monitoring visits, the PMU would hire an independent&#13;
auditor to audit the planning phase contract after the second payment is made.&#13;
3.19    The third payment of 30% of the total contract amount (equivalent to about US$9,000&#13;
per SO) depends on evidence that the planning phase completion report has been submitted by the&#13;
SO, the financial report is submitted and acceptable, and the cash contribution to capital cost has&#13;
been collected and deposited in the VWSC/SO joint account. The implementation phase proposal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
must also have been submitted; the audit of the planning phase (up to the second payment) must&#13;
be satisfactory, and all planning phase activities must be completed. The process and performance&#13;
monitoring and evaluation report must be satisfactory.&#13;
3.20    The objectives of the implementation phase are to construct the scheme, complete&#13;
training of VWSC and community members, complete hygiene and sanitation awareness activities,&#13;
construct latrines, and complete the women's development initiatives. The implementation phase&#13;
contract is an agreement among the community, the SO, and the PMU. It contains detailed terms&#13;
of reference that identify twelve distinct sets of activities to be carried out by the SO. The&#13;
implementation phase begins in mid-August of the second year and requires about fourteen&#13;
months. The implementation phase contract will be signed on the condition that a satisfactory&#13;
audit of the planning phase (para. 3.17) has been conducted and the community cash contribution&#13;
to the scheme construction cost has been deposited in a joint community-SO bank account. The&#13;
implementation phase includes the following activities:&#13;
(a)   Training of SO staff. This includes a refresher course in hygiene and&#13;
environmental sanitation awareness, construction supervision training, training&#13;
of trainers for women's development initiatives, and training of SO&#13;
accountants. Training of community members. This includes holding a&#13;
VWSC workshop; training the VWSC treasurer; village maintenance worker&#13;
and VWSC training, hygiene and environmental sanitation awareness training&#13;
for school teachers, village health promoters and community leaders; and&#13;
mother and child health training for tapstand women's groups. The training&#13;
activities continue through the implementation phase.&#13;
(b)   Construction planning. This activity consists of planning construction&#13;
activities, procuring all materials and equipment, and transporting them to the&#13;
construction site. This activity requires about six weeks and is completed by&#13;
early November of the second year.&#13;
(c)   Construction of the scheme. All construction (water supply, latrines,&#13;
drainage, and environmental actions) is carried out by the communities in two&#13;
stages, with technical support and input from SOs and monitoring by the PMU.&#13;
This activity requires about six months and is completed by early May of the&#13;
third year.&#13;
3.21     The implementation phase costs, on average, about US$52,800 per community, of&#13;
which about US$7,600 is contributed by the community in cash and kind and about US$45,200 is&#13;
contributed by the PM1U. The average per capita cost (based on current population) of the&#13;
implementation phase is about US$67, of which about US$10 is contributed by the community&#13;
and US$57 by the PMU. The implementation phase contract averages US$50,800 per village&#13;
(construction monitoring costs of about US$2,000 per village are excluded from the&#13;
implementation phase contract because this activity is sub-contracted by PMU to Service&#13;
Agencies under separate contractual arrangements). This cost includes SO community&#13;
development and technical personnel (about US$6,100), the community contribution (about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
US$7,600), and the cost of materials and equipment required to construct the scheme (about&#13;
US$37,100).&#13;
3.22     The outcome of the implementation phase is the consolidation of all activities, a&#13;
completed and functioning water supply and environmental sanitation scheme, and a trained&#13;
VWSC and community members. The payment terms within the implementation phase contract&#13;
have also been set to monitor closely the performance of SOs and communities and identify&#13;
problems early. All payments are linked to the completion of well-defined tasks that can be&#13;
monitored. During the implementation phase, two bank accounts are used. The first is a joint&#13;
account operated by the community and the SO; the second is operated by the SO. Community&#13;
and PMU contributions to the schemes construction cost is deposited in the joint bank account,&#13;
while the PMU payment of the SO community development and technical personnel cost is&#13;
deposited in the SO account. Three payments are made to the SO account, and two payments are&#13;
made to the joint account as follows:&#13;
*  About 30% of the cost of the SO community development and technical personnel&#13;
(equivalent to about US$1,800 on average per contract) is paid in advance. This&#13;
payment is conditional upon signing of the implementation phase contract and&#13;
evidence that all SO personnel are recruited. About 50% (equivalent, on average, to&#13;
about US$18,500 per community) of the total PMU contribution to scheme&#13;
construction cost (materials, other skilled labor and transport) is paid to the joint&#13;
community-SO account upon submission of the corresponding pro-forma invoices for&#13;
7&#13;
the first stage of construction.&#13;
*  About 30% of the cost of the SO community development and technical personnel&#13;
(equivalent, on average, to about US$1,800 per community) is paid to the SO account&#13;
and about 50% (equivalent, on average, to about US$18,500 per community) of the&#13;
total PMU contribution to scheme construction cost (materials, other skilled labor and&#13;
transport) upon evidence that specific activities defined within the implementation&#13;
phase contract terms of reference (para 3.20) are underway, all training is completed&#13;
and all first-stage construction materials and equipment have been delivered on site&#13;
and are of the same brand names specified in the pro-forma invoices. The women's&#13;
development initiatives and household latrine funds must have been transferred to the&#13;
VWSC account; the statements concerning the joint VWSC/SO account must have&#13;
been received and be satisfactory; and pro-forma invoices for the second stage of&#13;
construction8 must have been received.&#13;
*  About 40% of the cost of the SO community development and technical personnel&#13;
(equivalent, on average, to about US$2,500 per community) is paid to the SO account&#13;
upon evidence that: all construction activities have been completed and all training&#13;
carried out in accordance with the implementation phase proposal; the scheme&#13;
7     The first stage of construction includes: the construction of the intake; all environmental source protection&#13;
work; the construction of all main line structures (excluding the reservoirs); and, the laying of all main line pipe.&#13;
8     The second stage of construction includes all remaining works specified in the implementation proposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
accounts have been submitted and are satisfactory; and the statement of the VWSC&#13;
account has been submitted and indicates that the community is contributing to the&#13;
scheme's operation and maintenance costs.&#13;
3.23    The PMU/DPMU would appraise the site for each scheme during the preplanning and&#13;
planning phases of the scheme cycle. In addition, PMU/DPMI will carry out field monitoring&#13;
visits before making payments under the planning and implementation phases. In preparing&#13;
program estimates, a 13% village dropout rate was assumed between the planning and&#13;
implementation phases. At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that the PMU will enter into&#13;
arrangements with each SO and villages under such terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.24     Support organization eligibility criteria. T he PM1U would select SOs using a media&#13;
campaign according to the following criteria:&#13;
*  evidence of legal registration;&#13;
*  constitutional provision to engage in rural water supply and environmental sanitation&#13;
service delivery and related activities,&#13;
-  audited and certified accounts,&#13;
-  proven track record of at least three years' experience in rural water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation or community development activities evidenced by the&#13;
satisfactory completion of a participatory and demand driven project; and&#13;
-  demonstrated staffing capacity to carry out the proposed services or ability to procure&#13;
such staffing capacity.&#13;
3.25     The SO eligibility criteria are presented in Annex 15. Each SO shall be further&#13;
evaluated by the STAC using a ranking system described in Annex 15. The STAC will use this&#13;
ranking system to recommend the number of SOs it needs to undertake the corresponding batch&#13;
of villages and schemes. The adequacy of the criteria will be formally reviewed and assessed at the&#13;
end of the implementation phase of each batch of schemes. Criteria would then be revised or&#13;
modified to reflect lessons learned. At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that SO selection&#13;
would be carried out in accordance with the above eligibility criteria. At negotiations, assurances&#13;
were also obtained that PMU would review the adequacy of the SO eligibility criteria at the end&#13;
of the implementation phase of each batch of schemes and that changes introduced would need to&#13;
be acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.26     Scheme eligibility criteria. Each scheme accepted for PMU financing would need to&#13;
meet scheme eligibility criteria. These criteria would be applied at each phase in the cycle using&#13;
information available at that phase. During the initial operations of the PMU, the three criteria of&#13;
need and economic viability, technical feasibility, and sustainability and willingness to pay would&#13;
apply. These criteria are discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
* Need and economic viability. This is satisfied if one or more of the following&#13;
conditions holds:&#13;
(1)  the benefit/cost ratio is at least 1.59. This would be approximated at the&#13;
preplanning phase by asking whether the average time saved each day per&#13;
household would be more than two hours and thirty minutes (for piped water&#13;
schemes), half an hour (for hand pump tubewells and other point sources) and&#13;
whether per capita scheme costs were below defined thresholds (Rs. 2000 for&#13;
piped schemes and Rs. 500 for handpump schemes); or&#13;
(2)  the average per capita water availability is less than fifteen liters per day and per&#13;
capita costs are within the thresholds referred to in (1) above; or&#13;
(3)  a majority of the households are dependent upon heavily polluted sources and a&#13;
scheme could provide cleaner water through protection of existing sources or&#13;
cost effective amelioration of existing sources and per capita costs are within the&#13;
thresholds of (1) above.&#13;
* Technical feasibility. This is satisfied if:&#13;
(4)   there is an undisputed perennial source(s), water quality at the tap meets Indian&#13;
Standards (World Health Organization guidelines), and the minimum yield of the&#13;
proposed source is sufficient to meet 40 Ipcd or demand (on the design&#13;
population and including leakage and wastage) and the house connection&#13;
demand of at least seventy liters, as per GOI norms. Only if there is no other&#13;
solution and existing sources are heavily polluted or provided under 15 liters per&#13;
day, would a source supplying twenty-five litres per day be accepted;&#13;
(5)   there is compliance of engineering standards and service levels with established&#13;
PMU standards; and&#13;
(6)   appropriate mitigation measures for any adverse environmental impacts, and&#13;
appropriate arrangements for protecting or enhancing the source(s) are&#13;
proposed.&#13;
* Sustainability and willingness to pay. This is satisfied if:&#13;
(7)  communities accept to pay prior to commencement of any construction work a&#13;
cash contribution of 1% of capital cost in the hills and foothills and 2% in the&#13;
Bundelkhand. In the hills and foothills, villages will also contribute all labor for&#13;
trench digging for all water supply pipelines. In the Bundelkhand communities&#13;
will make an additional cash payment to cover 10% of capital cost prior to&#13;
A benefit/cost ratio (on discounted cash flows) of 1.5 (rather than 1) is conservative and was chosen to&#13;
allow some benefits to cover nonquantified overhead PMU costs, and to allow for contingencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
commissioning the water supply system. Bundelkhand villages will also pay for&#13;
all the unskilled labor for the construction of drainage works. In all regions,&#13;
those choosing house connections will pay a fee of Rs. 1,000,&#13;
(8)  participating communities will bear 100% of the O&amp;M costs. This cost includes&#13;
the cost of replacement parts (i.e., pumps and valves) for a twenty years design&#13;
life. During the Community Action Planning process, detailed cost estimates&#13;
with calculated monthly O&amp;M costs will be presented to the community. The&#13;
O&amp;M costs will be based on actual design options. A detailed O&amp;M plan with&#13;
100% cost recovery will be part of the scheme proposal. The project cost&#13;
recovery policies are further detailed in Annex 16;&#13;
(9)  there is satisfactory evidence that there is complete coverage within the village,&#13;
and&#13;
(10) any land acquisition for single schemes will only be done on a voluntary basis and&#13;
will be documented.&#13;
3.27    The adequacy of the criteria will be formerly reviewed and assessed at the end of the&#13;
implementation phase of each batch of schemes. They would then be revised or modified to&#13;
reflect lessons learned. At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that scheme selection will be&#13;
carried out in accordance with the above criteria. At negotiations, assurances were also obtained&#13;
that PMU would review the adequacy of the scheme eligibility criteria at the end of the&#13;
implementation phase of each batch of schemes and that changes introduced would need to be&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
4.02     Selection and construction of water supply and environmental sanitation&#13;
facilities for single and regional schemes. The total estimated cost of water supply and&#13;
sanitation schemes for the project would be about US$60.2 million (including about US$2 million&#13;
for construction monitoring), including contingencies, taxes, and duties. About 1, 1 50&#13;
communities (assuming a 13% dropout rate between the planning and implementation phases)&#13;
would be contracted for the planning phase, resulting in 230 planning phase contracts (for an&#13;
average value of about US$3 1,000 per contract and assuming that each support organization, on&#13;
average, will simultaneously work with five communities). About 1,000 implementation phase&#13;
contracts would be required, one contract per village with an average value of US$50,800, of&#13;
which about US$6,100 would be for community development activities and US$44,700 for&#13;
scheme construction. Each planning phase contract would be primarily for community&#13;
development activities, while each implementation phase contract would include community&#13;
development activities and non-local materials (small diameter pipes, fittings, taps, handpumps,&#13;
cement, etc.), labor, portage, and locally available materials. These numerous small contracts&#13;
would be scattered over a large number of small villages and spread over the six-year&#13;
implementation period. Because beneficiary communities will contribute cash and all unskilled&#13;
labor for trench digging, the following procurement procedures would be followed: SOs (with&#13;
exception for the first batch of schemes) would be identified by the PMM through a media&#13;
campaign and prequalified based on transparent and widely disseminated eligibility criteria. SOs&#13;
would be recruited as service providers under competitive bidding whenever possible and also as&#13;
sole providers for both the planning phase contract and the implementation phase contract. The&#13;
PMU would ensure efficiency and economy by comparing an SO's cost proposal with a schedule&#13;
of standard unit costs and prices developed during project preparation, which it would update&#13;
from time-to-time; should regional (multi-village) schemes be required and found feasible (para&#13;
3.1 1), civil works, goods and related services contracts would be procured following National&#13;
Competitive Bidding procedures to implement such schemes.&#13;
4.03     Goods and equipment for the PMU. The total estimated cost of goods and&#13;
equipment to be procured for the PMU would be about US$0.7 million, inclusive of&#13;
contingencies, duties, and taxes. The only goods and equipment to be procured for the PMUIU are&#13;
vehicles, computers, office furniture, and miscellaneous equipment. These cannot be grouped into&#13;
packages of more than US$100,000, they can be grouped only into several homogenous contracts&#13;
to be procured under a separate time schedule, each estimated to cost the equivalent of about&#13;
US$100,000. For this reason it is proposed that goods and equipment costing more than&#13;
US$25,000 be awarded by the PMU following national competitive bidding procedures. Items or&#13;
groups of items not costing more than the equivalent of US$25,000, subject to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$350,000, will be procured by prudent national shopping, requiring quotations from&#13;
at least three reputed suppliers.&#13;
4.04     Technical assistance, training, studies, audits, monitoring, publicity. The total&#13;
estimated cost of these items for the project would be about US$8.3 million, including&#13;
contingencies and duties.&#13;
4.05         Contract review. All contracts for civil works for regional schemes valued at&#13;
US$300,000 and above, and all individual contracts for goods and equipment for the PMU and&#13;
water supply and environmental sanitation schemes estimated to cost the equivalent of&#13;

US$100,000 or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval. In addition, the&#13;
Bank will review the first fifty contracts of the first batch schemes. Contracts for consulting firms&#13;
in excess of US$100,000 equivalent (for individual consultants, in excess of US$50,000&#13;
equivalent) would be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval. Assurances to the above&#13;
were obtained during negotiations. All other contracts would be subject to random post review in&#13;
the field by visiting missions. This will allow prior review of contracts representing at least 10%&#13;
of the procurement under the project&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
4.06      The PMU would be responsible for preparing all reimbursement applications. On the&#13;
basis of the proposed implementation schedule (Annex 9), the proceeds of the Loan would be&#13;
disbursed as outlined in Table 4.2 below.&#13;

4.07     The water supply and environmental sanitation schemes component include two&#13;
contracts, one for the planning phase and the other for the implementation phase. The planning&#13;
phase contract provides funding for support organizations to provide the salaries of a community&#13;
facilitator and a community worker (one for each village), a community development supervisor&#13;
(for about 3-5 months per village), a community technician (for 1-3 months per village), a junior&#13;
engineer or overseer (for 3-6 months per village), a senior engineer (for about 1-3 months per&#13;
village), an accountant and a team leader (each for about 0.5 months per village). The&#13;
implementation phase contract specifies its total amount, how much will be contributed by the&#13;
community, and how much will be contributed by the PMU. The PMU contribution at the&#13;
implementation phase includes funding for SO staff and overheads as above, as well as skilled&#13;
labor and materials and equipment for the construction of water supply and environmental&#13;
sanitation schemes. Non-statutory audits of project accounts and scheme-SO financial and&#13;
technical audits will be carried out by a private audit firm recruited by the PMU. Disbursements&#13;
against expenditures on contracts exceeding US$300,000 for civil works for regional schemes,&#13;
US$100,000, for goods and equipment for the PMU and for water supply and sanitation schemes,&#13;
contracts exceeding US$100,000 for consulting firms, and contracts exceeding US$50,000 for&#13;
individual consultants would be fully documented. For all other expenditures, disbursements&#13;
would be made against statements of expenditure. This documentation would not be submitted to&#13;
the Bank but would be retained by the PMU and made available for inspection by auditors and&#13;
during the course of Bank project supervision missions. At negotiations, it was agreed that the&#13;
completion, by PMU, of the technology manual, under the Implementation Manual, satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, would be a condition of disbursement for schemes. At negotiations, it was also agreed&#13;
that the completion by PMU of the development plan for Regional schemes and agreement with&#13;
the Bank on a set of eligibility criteria would be a condition of disbursement for Regional&#13;
schemes. The loan closing date is May 31, 2002. A schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex&#13;
17.&#13;
4.08     Retroactive financing and Special account. Since GOUP has already incurred&#13;
expenditures to prepare the project and to commence field activities, retroactive financing is&#13;
provided for all eligible expenditures incurred after July 31, 1995 provided that procurement&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank were followed. The total amount of retroactive financing&#13;
would be up to US$ 1.0 million, or about 1% of the Loan amount. To facilitate and expedite&#13;
disbursements, a special account with an authorized allocation of US$4.0 million (representing&#13;
about four months of Bank-financed expenditures) would be established on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. At negotiations, assurances to the above were obtained. The special&#13;
account would be used to finance all eligible expenditures, and would be replenished from time-&#13;
to- time upon receipt and approval of withdrawal applications supported by the required&#13;
documentation.&#13;
Accounts, Audit, and Reporting&#13;
4.09     Accounts. A project accounting and record-keeping system for the PMU has been&#13;
developed during project preparation. This system meets the accounting and reporting&#13;
requirements of the Government as well as the PMU and project accounting requirements. The&#13;
project accounting system records:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
*  Expenditures for strengthening operation of the PMIU;J&#13;
*  Expenditures for selection and construction of rural water supply and environmental&#13;
sanitation systems for single and regional schemes, with a breakdown on a scheme&#13;
basis between planning phase and implementation phase costs;&#13;
*  Expenditures for studies and sector development .&#13;
4.10     A scheme accounting manual has also been developed for SOs. Each SO would be&#13;
required in its contract to maintain separate scheme accounts and records to support the PMU&#13;
scheme accounting system. The SO would have to provide a detailed breakdown of expenditures&#13;
on a scheme basis for each main item, categorized into community contribution (cash and kind),&#13;
other itemized construction costs, and iternized community development costs. At negotiations&#13;
assurances were obtained that the PMU would require SOs to keep separate accounts for each&#13;
scheme and to adopt and follow the above accounting system. Each SO would be required to&#13;
provide the PMU with updated actual scheme accounts on expenditures regularly. Receipt of&#13;
such satisfactory updated scheme accounts by the PMU would be a condition of further PMU&#13;
disbursements to an SO. At negotiations, an assurance to this effect was obtained. In particular,&#13;
signing of the implementation phase contract will be conditional upon receipt of a satisfactory&#13;
audit report, prepared by an independent commercial auditor recruited by the PMU, of the&#13;
expenditures undertaken up to the second payment under the planning phase contract. At&#13;
negotiations assurances to this effect were obtained.&#13;
4.11     Audit. The PMU would maintain records and accounts in accordance with sound&#13;
accounting practices to reflect the operations, resources, and all expenditures for the project.&#13;
Such records and accounts of the PMU (including statements of expenditure and the special&#13;
account) would be audited annually by a qualified independent auditor in accordance with&#13;
appropriate, consistently applied auditing principles. No later than six months after the close of its&#13;
fiscal year, the PMU would be required to send the Bank a copy of its audited financial statements&#13;
and audit reports. Any other such information concerning the records, accounts, and audit as may&#13;
be reasonably requested by the Bank would be furnished by the PMU. In addition to the&#13;
foregoing, the PMU would retain all records of withdrawals made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditure for at least one year after the Bank receives the audit report, for the fiscal year in&#13;
which the last withdrawal is made. Such records would be made available to the Bank's&#13;
representatives on request and would be included in the annual audit reports. The audit report&#13;
would contain an opinion by the auditors as to whether the statements of expenditure submitted&#13;
and the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation could be relied upon to&#13;
support the related withdrawals. At negotiations, assurances to the above were obtained. In&#13;
addition, scheme accounts kept by support organizations would be subject to audits carried out by&#13;
conmmercial auditors to be recruited by the PMU in consultation with the Bank. Such audits&#13;
would take place after the second payment of the planning phase contract and after completion of&#13;
the implementation phase contract. At negotiations, assurances to the above were obtained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Monitoring, Evaluation and Supervision&#13;
4.12     Monitoring and evaluation play a critical role in ensuring both that the overall&#13;
profile of PMU performance is in line with the aims and objectives and that the implementation of&#13;
specific schemes, facilitated by the PM-U, incorporate the required level of technical quality and&#13;
effective beneficiary participation to make them sustainable. Because the PMU is set up as a&#13;
facilitating instrument rather than as a delivery system with its own line of execution, the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation a]so must ensure that adequate information is provided to all the&#13;
relevant stakeholders and managers - the community, the VWSC, SOs, the PMU, and the Bank&#13;
- to enable each to exercise their respective management and supervisory functions.&#13;
4.13     The PMU will activate and rely on a network of independent SOs to provide technical&#13;
and financial support to isolated and weakly organized communities wanting to improve and&#13;
manage their own water supply and sanitation facilities. The operational procedures need to&#13;
allow for a judicious balance between flexibility and prescription. Monitoring and evaluation must&#13;
therefore enable the PMIU to strike the right balance between the necessary risks inherent in this&#13;
approach on one hand and the need for enforcing compliance with standards and rules on the&#13;
other.&#13;
4.14     Monitoring and evaluation will differ between the PM[U (or program) level and the&#13;
scheme level. Because the PNfU is a facilitating agency, it has to monitor the overall progress&#13;
and impact of the investments made and the quality and performance of the contracted delivery&#13;
system. The VWSCs and the SOs are the primary managers of specific schemes. Monitoring and&#13;
evaluation must consequently address their responsibilities and interests in terms of field&#13;
implementation and quality control. Contractual compliance will be the PMU's concern.&#13;
4.15     The PMU is preparing a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation system with five&#13;
distinct points:&#13;
* Compliance. Contracts between the PMU, support organizations, and Village Water&#13;
and Sanitation Committees will be the main point of reference. Checking compliance&#13;
involves routine and standardized follow-up (including audits) of financial&#13;
management, agreed activities, and quality of outputs. Its purpose is to trigger&#13;
corrective actions or sanctions to ensure compliance with core operational&#13;
requirements.&#13;
*  Process and development. This will focus on how the quality and thrust of the&#13;
services provided change over time and will involve a continuous assessment of how&#13;
roles and responsibilities are played out over the scheme cycle as well as over batches.&#13;
Its purpose is to allow revisions of the PMU's procedural frameworks and&#13;
instruments.&#13;
*  Community. This will focus on users' capacity to manage the assets and awareness&#13;
generated by participation in the PMU program. SOs will facilitate community&#13;
assessments of the need for and quality of services and facilities provided. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
purpose is to provide an informed basis for active community management and&#13;
involvement.&#13;
*  Impact. Changes generated by the activities, inputs, and services will be assessed in&#13;
terms of the long-term objectives of the PMU. Post-implementation community&#13;
management of assets and the benefits (health, time savings) likely to accrue on a&#13;
sustained basis will be assessed. The purpose is to provide the PMU, and the overall&#13;
sector policy-makers, with a continuous assessment of the economic, financial, and&#13;
social justification for the program of investment.&#13;
*  Strategy. This is geared to documenting, disseminating, and learning from&#13;
experience. The PMU's adaptive and programmatic approach requires feedback on&#13;
which approaches are working well and which are not. This feedback can be&#13;
incorporated into the project in a cyclic or programmatic way.&#13;
4.16      These issues would be monitored through regular scheme visits by PMU and service&#13;
agency staff, scheme completion reports prepared by SOs and service agencies or the PMU,&#13;
audits by independent auditors, and Completion Reports to be written by the PMU after one&#13;
season of operation for a sample of schemes. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices studies will be&#13;
conducted before and after schemes for a selected number of communities each year, as will ex-&#13;
post reviews of a small sample of schemes four years after completion to assess impact and&#13;
sustainability issues in particular.&#13;
4.17      The PMU's monitoring and evaluation indicators focus both on scheme-specific issues&#13;
over the scheme cycle and on program level issues. Scheme-specific issues include the rate and&#13;
quality of implementation, the performance and capacity of SOs and VWSCs, the extent to which&#13;
assumed benefits are being realized, cost-efficiency, and the degree of active management by the&#13;
community. The program-level issues include cost-effectiveness of service delivery through the&#13;
private sector, suitability of PMU policies and procedures (including support organization and&#13;
scheme selection criteria), impact of water and sanitation interventions under varying socio-&#13;
economic and environmental conditions, and relative efficiency of different technology options&#13;
and design criteria. Monitoring indicators developed by the PMU are shown in Annex 18.&#13;
4.18      The PMU will have a limited in-house capacity to pursue the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation undertaken (para. 3.05). The Operations and Monitoring and Evaluation Unit head&#13;
would coordinate overall monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the PMU will contract service&#13;
agencies institutionally or individually to carry out the necessary field investigations and analysis.&#13;
4.19      The PMU shall prepare yearly work programs as well as quarterly and annual progress&#13;
reports. The reports shall cover the progress of the PMU operations, including physical progress,&#13;
costs, disbursements, technical assistance, training, and other pertinent information, together with&#13;
results of monitoring and evaluation of processes, impacts, and lessons learnt. A copy of the draft&#13;
annual work program shall be submitted to the Bank for its review and comments not later than&#13;
December 31 of each year commencing December 31, 1996. Copies of the quarterly and annual&#13;
progress reports shall be submitted to the Bank, beginning in 1997, within one month of the end&#13;
of each quarter and within one month of the end of the fiscal year, respectively. The reports shall&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
highlight constraints as well as proposed remedies, based on the results of the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. At negotiations, assurances were obtained to the above.&#13;
4.20     Bank Supervision. The project's financing of dispersed investments will face&#13;
logistical challenges, and some SOs will be dealing with a new approach to community&#13;
participation in decision making. Accordingly, the project is expected to require about eighteen&#13;
staff weeks of Bank implementation supervision for each of its two first years, about twenty-two&#13;
staff weeks for its third year (mid-term review) and fourteen staff weeks thereafter; in total, about&#13;
103 staff weeks over the six-year implementation period. The supervision plan is presented in&#13;
Annex 19.&#13;
4.21     A mid-term project review will be carried out no later than June 30, 1999 (at the end&#13;
of the third year). GOUP would be responsible for carrying out the mid-term review. Resources&#13;
to this effect have been included in project costs. The GOUP and the PMU would review&#13;
progress and decide whether components, implementation arrangements, policy reforms, and&#13;
PMU operating procedures need adjusting, as defined in the PMU Implementation Manual. This&#13;
mid-term review will provide a forum among the GOUP, the PMU, and the Bank to discuss issues&#13;
identified and agree on remedial measures no later than December 31, 1999, and will be followed&#13;
by the remedial actions agreed upon. At negotiations, assurances to the above were obtained.&#13;
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS, BENEFITS, COSTS, AND RISKS&#13;
Financial Analysis&#13;
5.01     State Finances. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (1995) (paras. 1.38-1.40)&#13;
stresses the need for state governments to improve their finances and for project proposals to&#13;
consider this objective. Despite substantial transfers from GOI, deficits in the GOUP revenue&#13;
account have been large in recent years. Consequently, levels of plan expenditure have been&#13;
relatively low. The large deficits in the revenue account have resulted in interest payments and&#13;
payments of debt as percentages of total non-plan expenditures which are significantly above the&#13;
national average, at 22.8% in 1991/92 compared to the all-states average of 17.9%. GOUP's&#13;
finances are also much more dependent on GOI transfers than the average, and these transfers&#13;
have grown from 33% in the late 1960s to over 50% of total revenue value since the late 1980s.&#13;
It is evident that great importance needs to be attached to reducing the fiscal stress of the GOUP.&#13;
Since it is expected to rehabilitate a number of existing schemes, the proposed project will achieve&#13;
this in a modest way initially by introducing the concept of cost recovery into the rural water&#13;
supply and environmental sanitation sector.&#13;
5.02     GOUP Investment Levels. GOUP funding of recent rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation investments is shown in Table 5.1. These expenditures have been about Rs. 1,600&#13;
million per annum, with more in 1994-1995. The project cost represents about 25% of the sector&#13;
investment, assuming the same 1994-95 investments in water supply and sanitation over six years.&#13;

1992-93             1,499             13              95              1&#13;
1993-94             1,453             1 1             163             2&#13;
1994-95             1,588             15             378              4&#13;
5.03     Counterpart Funds. GOUP has recognized the importance of all externally aided&#13;
projects in its internal arrangements for financial management. Special accounts are established&#13;
for all externally aided projects that selected officers are empowered to access without reference&#13;
to the Finance Department of GOUP. It is proposed that this arrangement be adopted for the&#13;
project. Thus, despite the present overall poor fiscal state of affairs, GOUP has taken steps to&#13;
ensure that the project implementation would proceed without delay due to the unavailability of&#13;
financing. At negotiations, assurance was obtained that GOUP would forward for Bank review,&#13;
by December 31 of each year, PMU's proposed budget with counterpart funding for the following&#13;
year.&#13;
Willingness to Pay, Affordability, and Poverty Alleviation&#13;
5.04     Households included in this project would make a small initial contribution to capital&#13;
cost and then mobilize funds for all subsequent O&amp;M expenditures. The initial capital&#13;
contribution would total about 10% of estimated scheme construction costs and would comprise&#13;
at least 1% in cash in the hills and foothills and 2% in the Bundelkhand, plus in-kind contributions&#13;
(unskilled labor for trench digging). The cash contribution would include the fees paid for&#13;
individual house connections (Rs. 1,000 per household). Communities would also make cash&#13;
contributions equal to the average estimated annual O&amp;M expenditure. The monthly O&amp;M fee&#13;
for house connections will be at least three times the fee for standpost users. A 5% surcharge on&#13;
this cash contribution would be used to establish an O&amp;M fund from which replacement of assets&#13;
would be undertaken. The cash contribution to the O&amp;M expenditure would be made on a&#13;
monthly basis.&#13;
5.05     The up-front cash contribution to capital cost per household required in the hills and&#13;
foothills ranges from Rs. 51 for deep tubewell handpumps to Rs- 145 for stream gravity systems&#13;
with an average amount of Rs. 101, and, for the Bundelkhand, it ranges from Rs. 132 for deep&#13;
tubewell (hand pump) to Rs. 210 for deep tubewell (pumping) with an average figure of Rs. 171.&#13;
It is expected that this contribution will be paid by a village in one lump sum, before the beginning&#13;
of the implementation phase. However, households will be able to make this contribution through&#13;
the 12-months duration of the planning phase. For households in the lowest income decile, the&#13;
up-front cash contribution to capital costs per household would represent about 2% of annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
cash income in the hills and foothills and about 7% of annual cash income in the Bundelkhand.&#13;
The up-front cash contribution to capital costs is considered affordable.&#13;
5.06      For O&amp;M the monthly charge per household for the hills and foothills is expected to&#13;
range from Rs. 13 for deep tubewell handpumps to Rs. 38 for the stream gravity system with an&#13;
average figure of Rs. 27; and, for the Bundelkhand, it would range from Rs. 17 for deep tubewell&#13;
(handpump) to Rs. 28 for deep tubewell (pumping) with an average figure of Rs. 22. Rather than&#13;
include a specific capital charge, such as depreciation on a regular basis, a surcharge of 5% will be&#13;
used to establish a maintenance find. This fund will, in effect, be a sinking fund as it will be used&#13;
for replacement of assets at the end of their useful life. For households in the lowest income&#13;
decile, the average monthly charge represents 7% of monthly cash income in the hills and foothills&#13;
and 11% of monthly cash income in the Bundelkhand. These amounts would be high. However,&#13;
an element of cross-subsidization at the village level has been built into the cost recovery policy&#13;
adopted by the project whereby households with house connections will pay a monthly fee for&#13;
O&amp;M at least three times the fee for standpost users. Because preliminary figures indicate that at&#13;
least 20% of households would request house connections, it can be concluded that the O&amp;M fee&#13;
can be significantly lowered for households in the lowest income decile, thus making the operation&#13;
and maintenance fee affordable.&#13;
5.07      In the hill and foothill region, almost every household has one or more members&#13;
(usually male) who have migrated to the cities in search of employment, leaving women, children,&#13;
and the elderly. The hill and foothill region has also been a major source of recruitment for the&#13;
armed forces and the police service. As a result, the hill and foothill economy is often referred to&#13;
as the "money order" economy, with remittances and pension funds constituting a large part of&#13;
household income. The income from agricultural activities is generally smaller since&#13;
approximately two thirds of household members working on the farms are women and children.&#13;
According to a study (Bora 1996), there are nearly 1.5 migrants per household in the hill and&#13;
foothill region.'0 This results in large cash income flows among the households in this region.&#13;
Average monthly rural household income is show in Table 5.2.&#13;

5.08     In contrast to the hills and foothills, people in the Bundelkhand are largely dependent&#13;
on their own farm income or their income as sharecroppers. A very small proportion of the&#13;
population are in formal wage employment. Most households tend to keep a large part of their&#13;
agricultural produce for domestic consumption and the small surplus available for sale is barely&#13;
enough to meet cash expenditure requirements. Therefore, the proportion of cash income is much&#13;
smaller in the Bundelkhand.&#13;
5.09     Willingness and Ability to Pay. The issue of affordability is sensitive for all actors in&#13;
the project and especially for the villagers who must bear the ultimate responsibility of building&#13;
and operating a water supply system with associated sanitation and health components. The&#13;
issues are very complex, and what may be perceived as an "affordability" problem is simply one in&#13;
which the focus of attention has been on the cost side of the equation. What at first may appear&#13;
to be an expensive and therefore "unaffordable" scheme may indeed be significantly cheaper than&#13;
the existing sources that are quite distant from the consumer, and often polluted with serious&#13;
environmental degradation resulting in severe health problems such as high levels of water-related&#13;
illnesses and increased levels of infant mortality. When these issues are discussed, the question of&#13;
"'affordability" often becomes less significant compared to the long-term advantages that&#13;
investment in safe and reliable supplies of potable water will bring to a community. Communities&#13;
are usually astute enough to recognize such long-term benefits and welcome the opportunity and&#13;
challenge that projects, such as the current one provides through facilitating access to the&#13;
necessary levels of finance.&#13;
5.10     Because this project is adopting a demand-driven approach, the commitment of the&#13;
villages to be involved and to actively participate in all stages of the project -including a&#13;
commitment to provide operation and maintenance and replacement costs- will be unequivocal&#13;
evidence of peoples' willingness and ability to pay for a level of service they believe will&#13;
adequately meet their demand for water. There are a range of technologies available, depending&#13;
on the particular geographical and environmental conditions. However, the option of choice is&#13;
firmly planted with the community. The question of affordability has been decentralized to the&#13;
level where it will directly impact the village. The village will simply not adopt a technology or&#13;
scheme if it exceeds their willingness and ability to pay, or their ability to reallocate resources to&#13;
ensure sufficient funding to achieve their desired level of service. Under such circumstances, the&#13;
usual risk of imposing an unaffordable scheme is greatly reduced since all costs, commitments,&#13;
and obligations will be fully discussed and approved by the community before any work is&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
5.11     Poverty Alleviation. This project will not explicitly target poor communities.&#13;
Projects in other countries have found that SOs often seek out less favored communities for&#13;
assistance, implying some automatic antipoverty targeting built into the project's demand-led&#13;
project procedures. Moreover, better-off communities have already often benefited from&#13;
schemes, leaving poorer areas with major service gaps. Finally, many poor families are members&#13;
of larger communities. Since complete coverage within communities would be an eligibility&#13;
criterion, members of the poverty group should benefit at least in proportion to their share of the&#13;
total population. A relatively high percentage of households in the Bundelkhand are considered&#13;
below the poverty level.&#13;

Environmental Assessment&#13;
5.12     The project is expected to have a net positive effect on the environment. Positive&#13;
impacts from rural water supply and sanitation are expected to arise from: (a) improved&#13;
ecological conditions in watershed areas, which will increase the availability and quality of water;&#13;
(b) time and energy savings from a reduced need for women and children to fetch water, will&#13;
result in improved family health and the opportunity for women to use time saved for economic&#13;
and productive activities; (c) more effective use of water for bathing, washing, and cleaning will&#13;
benefit the environment; (d) expected lower fertility in rural women due to reduced disease&#13;
morbidity in children, reduced infant mortality, improvements in hygiene and sanitation practices,&#13;
and family health, (e) controlled disposal of human wastes will reduce bacterial contamination of&#13;
the environment, (f) better environmental management, including catchment protection;.and (g)&#13;
increased community capacity for self-reliance and independence&#13;
5.13     The potential negative environmental effects of rural water supply and sanitation&#13;
include:(a) erosion and water logging problems due to overflow or washout from water supply&#13;
system components (specifically from reservoirs), (b) pollution problems due to increased water&#13;
use without adequate wastewater disposal and groundwater pollution from inappropriate&#13;
sanitation units (latrines) or from improper well construction techniques (allowing surface&#13;
drainage into the wells); (c) bringing contaminated surface water closer to households and&#13;
polluted sources could present hazards; (d) increased water use for domestic purposes could deny&#13;
other users, such as agricultural, (e) rapid expansion of settlement areas due to availability of&#13;
improved water supplies, leading to over congestion and environmental pollution, and (f) erosion&#13;
due to construction activities such as quarrying and use of access roads. Many of the potential&#13;
adverse effects will be mitigated or avoided by activities planned under the project.&#13;
Notwithstanding these potentially adverse environmental problems, the net environmental impact&#13;
of the project is expected to be positive. Annex 20 describes potential environmental impacts of&#13;
the project and the mitigation measures that will be undertaken.&#13;
Promotion of the Private Sector&#13;
5.14      A major focus of this project would be to assist GOUP in reducing its role in providing&#13;
those services that can be undertaken more efficiently by others (private sector, non-governmental&#13;
organizations, community-based organizations, communities etc.). GOUP can then focus its&#13;
attention on those essential activities for which it has a comparative advantage. In the case of&#13;
rural water supply and sanitation, these activities include: policy formulation; subsidizing private&#13;
provision where appropriate, in this case through grants to SOs and communities; monitoring the&#13;
performance of different sector actors in accomplishing sectoral objectives (which would be&#13;
sought through the studies and institutional development component); and, research and&#13;
development of appropriate technologies. The project will also assist GOUP in the difficult and&#13;
sensitive process of redefining its policies to facilitate efficient service delivery by the private&#13;
sector. The most important immediate impacts on the private sector would arise from funding of&#13;
schemes initiated and implemented with the assistance of SO and by the communities themselves.&#13;
This will accelerate the delivery of water supply and sanitation services and provide a precedent&#13;
for other sectors. The training of SO staff under the project would enhance the capacity of the&#13;
private sector to carry out an expanded program in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
Impact on Women&#13;
5.15     The project would increase access of women and their young children to improved,&#13;
adequate, and safe water and sanitation facilities, which in turn would have a positive and direct&#13;
effect on their health and productivity. In addition to time and energy savings, direct impacts on&#13;
women include: (a) productivity gains due to improvements in health; (b) more privacy brought&#13;
about by improved sanitation facilities, (c) enhanced women's role and capability in management&#13;
of water supply and sanitation (WSS) schemes as well as in their health, social, and economic&#13;
welfare; (d) increased literacy through the non-formal education activities, and (e) increased&#13;
participation of women workers who could serve as role models and in turn raise women's&#13;
aspirations.&#13;
5.16     The project activities designed for the participation of women would instill a sense of&#13;
confidence through increased mobility and interaction around the community and increased access&#13;
to productive activities. This would result in institutional and social benefits, such as well-&#13;
fuinctioning water-user groups and enhanced status of women.&#13;
5.17     The most significant benefits to women are the development of skills for use in&#13;
income-generating activities and increased participation in community-organized activities such as&#13;
managing the water supply systems, made possible by the freeing up of time once spent collecting&#13;
water. Women's participation in water management is expected in: water regulation, collection&#13;
of user fees, maintenance; and reporting, monitoring, and evaluation.&#13;
5.18     One risk for the project is the negative attitude towards the move to a more equal or&#13;
active participation of women in RWSES activities, which may prove more difficult to overcome&#13;
and result in lower participation rates than expected. Such negative attitudes would be addressed&#13;
through specific information and education awareness programs targeting local government&#13;
officials, community leaders, and the community at large.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
5.19     Project Justification. The proposed project would be justified on the basis of the&#13;
direct benefits to about 800,000 rural inhabitants initially (rising to about 1.2 million as&#13;
populations rise to design levels). It would also generate unquantifiable benefits in the long term&#13;
through the enhanced operations of non-governmental agencies involved in the project. Project-&#13;
funded R&amp;D activities would result in improved practices and techniques for cost-effective supply&#13;
of water and sanitation services. By developing procedures for public funding of demand-driven&#13;
community-based development, this project would enable wider replication of sustainable rural&#13;
water and sanitation facilities than has been possible through top-down public programs.&#13;
5.20     Direct Benefits. Rural populations would save time and effort collecting water and&#13;
become healthier because of more and cleaner water, improved health knowledge, and better&#13;
hygiene practices. Many of these benefits are difficult or impossible to measure at present. The&#13;
only benefits that have been quantified are the value of time saved in water collection and the&#13;
value of increased water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
5.21       Time Savings. A household survey, commissioned by the PMU, was undertaken in&#13;
four districts in the project area (two in the hills and foothills and two in the Bundelkhand)&#13;
covering 20 villages with a sample size of 210 households. The principal aim of the survey was to&#13;
quantify the current time spent collecting water and to identify the potential time savings that may&#13;
result from the project. Surveys of this type are difficult because of the large range of variables&#13;
involved in the collection of water. Follow-up field checks in the project area, collection of&#13;
secondary data, and careful scrutiny of the raw data, allowed a reasonable estimate of time spent&#13;
collecting water being obtained.&#13;
5.22       Substantial time is now being spent collecting water from distant sources for all&#13;
domestic and other household needs, most notably water for animals but also for bathing and&#13;
washing clothes. The burden of this task overwhelmingly falls on women and children. As shown&#13;
in Table 5.3, the weighted average time spent collecting water per household per day in the&#13;
project area is about 4.6 hours (on average 4.9 hours per day per household in the hills and&#13;
foothills and 3.5 hours per day per household in the Bundelkhand).&#13;

2 This assumes that the weighted average time saved will be 78% of the time now spent before the&#13;
project This is derived as follows&#13;
80% standpost or wells will save 75% of current time&#13;
20% house connections will save 90% of current time&#13;
therefore weighted average time savings =&#13;
(0.8 x 0.75) + (0.2 x 0.9) = 0.78 (of time spent collecting water before the project)&#13;
5.23       Studies conducted in Nepal" (Annex 21, Table 2), where socio-cultural conditions&#13;
are similar to those in the hills and foothills in Uttar Pradesh showed considerable variation in time&#13;
saved, from -44% to -80%, depending on the unit of measurement. These figures refer primarily&#13;
to standposts. After examining conditions in the field, it is believed that both house and standpost&#13;
and well systems will achieve considerable savings. For house connections, an assumed 90% of&#13;
the existing time taken to fetch water will be saved though the project. For standposts and wells,&#13;
75% of the time currently taken to fetch water will be saved by the project. A sensitivity analysis&#13;
has been undertaken to assess the impact of using figures resulting from the project quantified&#13;
risks.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
5.24     The project design is based on 30% of households receiving a house connection and&#13;
consuming 70 Ipcd,and 70% of households receiving water from a standpost or well and&#13;
consuming 40 Ipcd. Because of technical problems, some villages will be able to utilize only&#13;
standposts or wells. When this is considered, the actual proportion of house connections will fall&#13;
to only 20% of total households served. Because current consumption is constrained by supply,&#13;
in terms of both physical and geographical limitations in obtaining water, it is difficult to estimate&#13;
what current demand would be if supply were unconstrained.&#13;
5.25     Based on assumptions and data set out above, an average beneficiary household is&#13;
expected to save 3.6 hours (216 minutes) per day (228 minutes in the hills and foothills and 162&#13;
minutes in the Bundelkhand) after the project (Table 5.3).&#13;
5.26     Reduced time in collecting water will increase consumption. As shown in Annex 21,&#13;
Table 2, the arc elasticity of demand was estimated to be -0.54, which indicates that on average&#13;
over the particular range of the demand curve indicated, a 10% reduction in time taken will&#13;
increase consumption by 5.4%. Because this incremental consumption presumably was not&#13;
considered worthwhile to collect before the project, the level of time savings obtained from this&#13;
additional consumption after the project will be lower. This also assumes, however, that such&#13;
quantity of additional water was indeed actually available before the project. In many cases in the&#13;
project area, especially in the dry season, this is not the case, and the supply constraint determines&#13;
the actual level of consumption. A common practice is to assume time savings of half the rate&#13;
that time savings accrue on the existing level of consumption. It is difficult to estimate what the&#13;
level of unconstrained demand is in the project area and hence what the after-project level of&#13;
demand would be. For the purposes of this analysis, a figure of 20% additional time savings has&#13;
been assumed to accrue to incremental consumption.&#13;
5.27     Value of Time Saved. The value of time saved is estimated by the opportunity cost&#13;
of labor, that is, what income is lost in foregoing other income-generating activities. The shadow&#13;
wage rate for unskilled labor is used as the basis for the monetary value of this opportunity cost.&#13;
The important point is that there are alternative income generating activities available, that is,&#13;
there is indeed an opportunity cost incurred. These need not necessarily be in the formal sector.&#13;
Significant income-generating activities can be undertaken in the non-formal sector. It is&#13;
irrelevant whether time saved is actually used for these other income-generating activities for&#13;
them to have economic value. For example, the fact that a woman may choose to spend the time&#13;
saved as a result of the project with her children rather than in income-generating activities does&#13;
not imply that time spent with children has a lower economic value. What this clearly illustrates is&#13;
that women place a value on this activity (time with children) which is at least as high as what&#13;
they could have obtained if they had engaged in formal or non-formal income generating&#13;
activities. A major component of the project will be women's development initiatives, which aim&#13;
to develop and encourage alternative income-generating activities.&#13;
5.28     The time spent collecting water and the opportunities for alternative income-&#13;
generating activities vary considerably throughout the year. During harvest time, substantial&#13;
alternative employment opportunities are more widely available compared to non-harvest times.&#13;
In the dry season, virtually all water must be obtained away from the residence; in many instances&#13;
long and difficult journeys are involved. In the wet season, almost all the household requirement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
for water for animals and market garden activities, etc., is obtained from rainwater. Water for&#13;
drinking and cooking is still mostly obtained from external sources because water from these&#13;
sources has a preferred taste and is considered to be cleaner and safer than drinking rainwater.&#13;
The highest opportunity cost of labor would therefore occur during those dry times when&#13;
harvesting activities occur. At these times all household requirements for water are obtained&#13;
away from the household, yet there are substantial alternative income-generating activities that&#13;
could be undertaken. The opportunity cost of collecting water is high. At other times, such as&#13;
the wet season, the opportunity cost of labor is lower. In an attempt to accommodate such&#13;
diverse circumstances, the opportunity cost of labor has been weighted to reflect the diversity of&#13;
opportunities throughout the year and the relative value that would accrue to consumers with&#13;
house connections and standposts. This gives a factor which can be used to apply to time saved&#13;
at any time during the year. This is shown in Annex 21, Table 3.&#13;
5.29      The value of unskilled labor in both formal and informal employment (the opportunity&#13;
cost of labor) when such employment is available, is currently approximately Rs. 35 per day on&#13;
average. This has been adjusted to reflect its average weighted economic value throughout the&#13;
year, resulting in a value of Rs. 19 per day or approximately Rs. 2.38 per hour, assuming an&#13;
eight-hour work day. This figure is further adjusted by the Standard Conversion Factor to&#13;
convert into border prices (Rs 2.14). The detailed calculations are shown in Annex 21, Table 3.&#13;
5.30      The reduced time saving accruing to incremental consumption incurs the same&#13;
opportunity cost and therefore its value will also be Rs. 2.38 per hour.&#13;
5.31      Costs. All costs used were estimated by the project and are expressed in constant&#13;
1996 prices, net of taxes. Community development costs for each type of scheme include the&#13;
development costs of the 13% of villages which drop out between planning and implementation&#13;
phases. A physical contingency of 10% is included where appropriate.&#13;
5.32      Benefit and Cost Analysis and ERRs.12 The economic rate of return (ERR) is&#13;
estimated to be 20% for the whole project and 26% if the cost of strengthening and operating the&#13;
PMU and studies and sector development are excluded. ERRs and switching values have been&#13;
calculated for each type of scheme, first, including all community development and scheme&#13;
construction expenses, and second, including only scheme construction costs. Both estimates&#13;
understate the true ERR, since there is no quantification of benefits of improved health, sanitation,&#13;
environmental and community development activities. For comparative purposes, each scheme is&#13;
assumed to commence in year one. The individual schemes are shown in Annex 21, Tables 4A to&#13;
4L. ERRs are then calculated for all schemes together according to an assumed mix of scheme&#13;
types (Annex 1, Table 2) and according to the implementation schedule shown in Annex 21, Table&#13;
5. A summary of the results by scheme and for the total project is shown in Table 5.3. The&#13;
detailed estimation of all ERRs is shown in Annex 21, Table 6 and for the total project in Annex&#13;
21, Table 4.7.&#13;
13.    Benefits and costs are cxprcssed in border prices and haxe becn forecast over a 24-year horizon from the&#13;
first year of the project in 1996. Border prices have been estimated by applying the Standard Conversion Factor&#13;
(SCF) of 0.9 to all domestic expenditures and benefits. Switching values have been calculated using the 12%&#13;
opportunity cost of capital for India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
5.33      Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity tests, based upon assessed risks, indicate that the&#13;
project is able to absorb substantial negative impacts yet still generate positive ERRs and net&#13;
present values (NPV). For example, the project can sustain:&#13;
*  a significant reduction in the number of house connections. The project ERR is&#13;
relatively insensitive to changes in this variable (Table 5.7) since only 20% of&#13;
households are expected to use this type of connection;&#13;
*  failure to realize time savings. If all villages were only able to achieve the minimum&#13;
time savings required in the eligibility criteria, the total project ERR would fall to 15%&#13;
(Table 5.6);&#13;
*  complete failure of a high proportion of schemes (71%) in year 10 before the project&#13;
ERR falls below 12% (Table 5.8);&#13;
*  significant decreases in benefits or increases in costs.&#13;
5.34      In most schemes, benefits are more sensitive than costs.&#13;

Risks&#13;
5.35     There are a number of risks which could adversely affect the successful&#13;
implementation and sustainability of the project. They can be divided into three broad categories.&#13;
5.36     Resistance to Change. The change from a supply-driven and top-down approach to&#13;
a demand-driven and bottom-up approach will be strongly resisted by many traditional actors in&#13;
the sector. Entrenched institutions and bureaucracies fail to see the need for paradigm shifts&#13;
despite the overwhelming evidence that the current approach is failing. The Bank has worked&#13;
closely with PMU staff and they now form a critical nucleus of highly committed and dedicated&#13;
personnel who are fully committed to the demand-driven approach of the project. They&#13;
understand and accept the need for appointing women to important decision-making positions in&#13;
the PMU/DPMU and the VWSC. They appreciate the need to monitor the situation closely and&#13;
to act decisively to isolate attitudes that are not conducive to the demand-driven approach.&#13;
Changes in personnel in these crucial organizations could change the situation, so the Bank will&#13;
undertake regular and careful monitoring and action will be requested to avoid this problem if or&#13;
when it is identified.&#13;
5.37     Some SOs may find it difficult to accept the need to conform to a set of standards and&#13;
a new way of implementing projects. Many SOs also adopt a top-down approach and may&#13;
attempt to revert to their entrenched ways of doing business. The project design has made&#13;
extensive provision for training and monitoring of SOs at every phase of the scheme cycle. SOs&#13;
that cannot accept the approach will be replaced.&#13;
5.38     At the village level, resistance to change can seriously impede the progress of a project&#13;
as people fail to absorb the innovations being introduced and revert to traditional ways. Poor&#13;
health and hygiene practices may continue despite the very strong education and community-&#13;
development programs that have been designed for the project. The programs to protect micro-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
watersheds and catchment protection may fail to deliver the promised benefits as villages continue&#13;
traditional farming, harvesting, and environmentally unsustainable land management practices.&#13;
5.39     Resistance to change would delay the implementation of the project, which would&#13;
delay the benefits. A reduction in benefits by 34% would reduce the ERR to 12%. In extreme&#13;
cases it could lead to the failure of schemes. If 71% of them fail in year 10, the ERR would fall&#13;
to 12%.&#13;
5.40     Absorptive Capacity. The absorptive capacity of the PMU/DPMU, SOs and the&#13;
villages will be critical to the successful implementation of the project. The project design has set&#13;
ambitious targets in terms of the numbers of schemes to be implemented and the PMU/DPMU&#13;
must be able to respond quickly and efficiently to the requests from SOs and villages. Delays in&#13;
establishing and managing the systems designed to facilitate smooth implementation will result in&#13;
a serious loss of credibility with the SOs and villages. Training of both PMU and DPMU staff is a&#13;
major component of the project and this will ensure that adequate absorptive capacity will be in&#13;
place.&#13;
5.41     SOs have varying technical abilities. The construction components of the project rely&#13;
on these abilities to deliver systems that provide clean water and sanitation facilities. The&#13;
Implementation Manual is designed to be a dynamic document updated regularly to enhance the&#13;
level of technical ability of SOs. The use of a number of different SOs will provide benchmark&#13;
data for PMU/DPMUs on SO performance. The management information system (MIS) planned&#13;
for the project is designed to provide early warning of SO problems so that they can be corrected&#13;
before they negatively impact on the project.&#13;
5.42     For the villages, the project will offer the first real hope in many years of obtaining safe&#13;
and reliable water and sanitation facilities close to residences. To capture the full benefits,&#13;
however, villages must be able to absorb and comprehend the process of project implementation&#13;
that they are being offered. The decision-making process will start with the villages but this will&#13;
work only if women, for example, are encouraged and take an active role in the VWSC. The&#13;
project has extensive community development components to assist the villages in the adoption of&#13;
new ideas, processes, and actions.&#13;
5.43     The failure to grasp the philosophy, ideals, and actions that the demand-driven&#13;
approach calls for will delay benefits and increase the likelihood of scheme failure. If benefits are&#13;
delayed by two years the ERR will fall to 12%.&#13;
5.44     Financial Sustainabilty. Villages will be carefully scrutinized in the selection&#13;
process, and only those which make a firm commitment to O&amp;M will be included. Evidence in&#13;
other areas indicates that the concept of ownership also bestows responsibility. The villages must&#13;
make a cash contribution towards the capital cost and invest considerable amounts of time and&#13;
energy in the selection, design, and construction of schemes. Such ownership will encourage&#13;
beneficiaries to contribute to O&amp;M. The project also provides for extensive community&#13;
development and training activities which will focus on the importance of O&amp;M and the cost of&#13;
not properly maintaining their system. If 71% of schemes fail in year ten then the project ERR&#13;
will fall to 12%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
5.45     The above risks are known and quantified to the extent that substantial adverse effects&#13;
can occur, yet a reasonable ERR, not falling below 12% in all cases, can still be maintained. The&#13;
project design has incorporated a high degree of flexibility to allow such risks to be identified&#13;
early and satisfactorily absorbed.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
h) All contracts for civil works for regional schemes valued at US$300,000 and above, all&#13;
individual contracts for goods and equipment for the PMU and water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation schemes estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or&#13;
more would be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval. The Bank will review&#13;
the first 50 contracts of the first batch schemes. Contracts for consulting firms in&#13;

INDIA&#13;
Uttar Pradesh Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project&#13;
Detailed Promect Description&#13;
1.    The Project includes the following three components:&#13;
(A)   Strengthening and Operation of the Project Management Unit&#13;
(B)   Selection and Construction of Water Supply and Environmental&#13;
Sanitation Facilities for Single and Regional Schemes&#13;
(C)   Studies and Sector Development&#13;
A. Strenffthening and Operation of the Proiect Manaaement Units (US$ 8.31 million)&#13;
2.    The overall responsibility for ensuring that all project components are implemented&#13;
according to agreed criteria would rest with the Project Management Unit under the Rural&#13;
Development Department (RDD). The RDD is appropriate for this role because the proposed&#13;
project is for rural areas.&#13;
3.    At the State Level a Project Management Unit (PMiU) has been established as a&#13;
Registered Society in 1994 to manage and coordinate project implementation. The PMU is an&#13;
intermediary responsible to facilitate Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation&#13;
service delivery with community participation at all stages of the decision-making process.&#13;
The PMU is constituted with an Executive Committee headed by the Agricultural Production&#13;
Commnissioner and a Staff Secretariat headed by a Director supported by 13 higher level staff&#13;
and 17 support staff. Given the size of the project, the PMU will be assisted in its functions at&#13;
the district level by seven District Project Management Units (DPMUs). Each DPMU will be&#13;
staffed with four higher level staff and three support staff.&#13;
4.    The main objective of the PMU/DPMUs is to facilitate demand-led rural water supply&#13;
and sanitation through studies and schemes managed at the lowest appropriate level. The&#13;
schemes, and lessons learned from their implementation, will assist in sector policy reform and&#13;
systemic changes in the RWSS sector in Uttar Pradesh. A related objective will be to facilitate&#13;
local capacities needed to ensure the long term sustainability of schemes. The PMU/ DPMUs&#13;
have no direct service delivery responsibilities and will sub-contract these responsibilities to&#13;
Support Organizations (SOs) and to communities. SOs consist of NGOs, Community Based&#13;
Organizations (CBOs), private firms, and institutions which have sufficient capacity to help&#13;
mobilize and assist communities. They are selected by the PMU on the basis of transparent&#13;
criteria. Since the proposed program is demand-led and community based, rural communities&#13;
themselves will be responsible for playing the major role in each of the three project phases&#13;
(Pre-planning, Planning and Implementation). Since many communities lack organizational&#13;
and technical skills to complete schemes on their own they will be assisted by SOs. The role&#13;
of SOs will be to assist communities by facilitating a decision-making and planning process at&#13;
the community level, and to provide technical support to ensure quality of construction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 2 of 13&#13;
Communities, with SO support, will implement single schemes directly. In the case regional&#13;
schemes, which may require other arrangements, a 12 month study will be conducted&#13;
beforehand to determine the most appropriate method of implementation for such schemes.&#13;
5.    Services Agencies (SAs) will be used to build overall capacities, provide training,&#13;
some monitoring, all auditing of SOs, as well as other specialized services and expertise.&#13;
These SAs will consist of apex/resource NGOs and firms, training organizations, and other&#13;
private, professional associations or entities with the requisite qualifications. The component&#13;
includes funding for the following activities.&#13;
6.    Operating Costs (US$3.81 million): Operating costs include administrative and&#13;
overhead costs, staff compensation, PMU and DPMU office and vehicle rental and traveling&#13;
allowances. Compensation includes salaries and benefits for a total of 79 staff and local&#13;
consultants for the PMU and seven DPMUs. In the PMU, costs cover salaries and benefits for&#13;
13 higher level staff/consultants and 17 support staff. At the DPMU level, 28 higher level&#13;
staff/consultants and 21 support staff are supported.&#13;
7.    Equipment and Vehicle (US$0.73 million!: This includes the purchase of one vehicle,&#13;
furniture, and fixtures for both PMU and DPMU offices. It also includes computer equipment&#13;
consisting of one terminal for each professional staff, and requisite software and multimedia&#13;
equipment.&#13;
8.    Technical Assistance (US$ 1.18 million): Approximately 48 person months of one&#13;
senior advisor is provided over a six year period, to help support the overall management&#13;
processes of the project, and in particular, to strengthen the community development&#13;
component of the project. Given the skill balance of the team, the advisors should be&#13;
specialists in working with the private and voluntary sector, and have strong skills in&#13;
community development and participatory methods. Also, 142 person months (either local or&#13;
international) of short term consultancies will include, but not be limited to: community water&#13;
and sanitation engineering, economic analysis, media/communications, social marketing, and&#13;
participatory development and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
9.    Audit (US$ 0.21 million): This includes funding for the cost of an audit to be carried&#13;
out by government auditors, the cost of an audit to be carried out by a private auditor as well&#13;
as the cost of a financial audit of the planning phase and the cost of a financial and technical&#13;
audit of schemes once completed.&#13;
10.   Impact. Site Appraisals and Water Ouality Testing (US$ 0.36 million): Includes the&#13;
cost of impact evaluation in 5% of the project villages, pre-planning site appraisals conducted&#13;
either by PMU or a SA for each village and the cost of purchasing water quality testing kits.&#13;
Water quality testing will be carried out by PMNU/DPMU staff&#13;
11.   SO/SA Training and Monitoring and Evaluation(US$ 1.78 million): This includes a&#13;
series of training programs for personnel of SOs and SAs to ensure that they can effectively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 3 of 13&#13;
carry out their terms of reference as catalysts of communities in completing the project cycle&#13;
in village schemes. It includes training in:&#13;
(a)   The preparation of prefeasibility studies during a 4 day workshop and planning&#13;
phase proposal preparation during a 5 day workshop. Both workshops are&#13;
taking place during the pre-planning phase,&#13;
(b)   Participatory Community Action Planning (CAP) and monitoring during 10&#13;
day workshop during the Planning Phase.&#13;
(c)    Survey, design, and costs (25 days workshop), construction technologies (25&#13;
days workshop), during the planning phase and construction monitoring (8&#13;
days workshop) during the implementation phase;&#13;
(d)   Monitoring and Evaluation methods and tools. This training is taking place&#13;
during the planning phase and consists of a 5 days workshop (for SAs);&#13;
(e)    Specialized training as needed for both the planning phase and implementation&#13;
phase,&#13;
(f)    District workshops, regional and annual review meeting,&#13;
(g)   Training of trainers for Women Development Initiatives (WDI) (3 days) during&#13;
the implementation phase, and training for community development supervisors&#13;
in health education, women's development (10 days) during the planning&#13;
phase,&#13;
12.   PMU/DPN/IU Training and Communications (US$ 0.24 million):In addition to the&#13;
above training, costs associated with Training Materials Production, and Staff training of the&#13;
PMU/DPMU are included in this sub-component. A description follows:&#13;
(a)   Supplemental training materials, including user-friendly participatory tools and&#13;
community action-planning kits, and audiovisual programs would be produced&#13;
and distributed for use by SOs. This will include the use of filmstrip and slide&#13;
projectors designed for village use.&#13;
(b)   A project information package will be designed, produced and distributed to&#13;
SOs, communities, and local government officials. This will include a&#13;
description of the project cycle, criteria and procedures for working with the&#13;
PMU/DPMUs.&#13;
(c)   PM-U/DPMU Staff training: This will include an initial 3 weeks intensive field-&#13;
based immersion with an NGO in participatory methods for community water&#13;
supply and sanitation. This training should be undertaken before launching&#13;
activities with SOs. Subsequent staff training at regional and international sites&#13;
I&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                         Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 13&#13;
will include cross visits to other community-based projects in Nepal, Bolivia,&#13;
Sri Lanka and similar programs. Specific skill training in computers, project&#13;
management, design of environmental components, participatory methods, and&#13;
gender sensitivity will be included.&#13;
B. Selection and Construction of Water Suiply and Environmental Sanitation&#13;
Facilities for Single and Re6ional Schemes (US$ 60.21 million)&#13;
13.   The scheme cycle spans 33 months and includes the following phases: pre-planning (7&#13;
months), planning ( 12 months), and implementation (14 months). The duration of each phase&#13;
would depend on scheme size and community capacity to organize for collective benefit. This&#13;
component provides funding for community development and construction activities.&#13;
14.   Community Development (US$ 9.71 million): Community development activities&#13;
includes funding for three components:&#13;
(a)   capacity building activities;&#13;
(b)   hygiene and environmental sanitation awareness (HESA); and&#13;
(c)   women's development initiatives (WDI).&#13;
These activities occur both in the planning and implementation phase. The main thrust of&#13;
community development activities is to encourage users, particularly women, to participate in&#13;
decision making to increase ownership for long term scheme sustainability.&#13;
15.   Capacity Building Activities: Activities in the first component include community&#13;
organization/ mobilization and complementary nonformal education (NFE) classes. These&#13;
include a series of small workshops, group discussions, information campaigns and&#13;
participatory community action planning (CAP) training to enable users to organize and elect&#13;
a representative and responsive Village Water and Sanitation Committee (VWSC). The&#13;
VWSC will have at least 30% women and will represent other minority groups such as the&#13;
scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. NFE will be integrated with the CAP process and will&#13;
focus on functional literacy, decision making and problem solving. The unit cost for capacity&#13;
building activities for a village with a population of 500 is estimated at Rs 65,000.&#13;
16.   HESA Activities: The second component HESA will focus in improving personal and&#13;
domestic hygiene and environmental sanitation. HESA would be conducted in informal&#13;
settings and by using real life situations and experiences. Women would be the focal point&#13;
for HESA, and activities would be conducted through tapstand and/or women's groups.&#13;
Women would be involved in monitoring and evaluation by measuring changes in hygiene&#13;
practices such as water use and management, and tapstand hygiene. The unit cost for a&#13;
village with a population of 500 for HESA activities is estimated at Rs 5,000.&#13;
17.   WDI Activities: The third component (WDI) provides support to help (i) women&#13;
develop skills required to realize the benefits of improved water supplies; (ii) improve access&#13;
to the formal credit system; (iii) promote women's role in planning and implementing water&#13;
supply and sanitation schemes including environmental resource enhancement initiatives; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(iv) encourage participation in resource mobilization activities such as collection of user&#13;
charges, and monitoring and evaluation. Project support would be in the form of training at&#13;
the rate of Rs 500/person. This component will focus its activities on NFE participants and&#13;
tapstand/women's groups.&#13;
18.   Pre Planning Phase. As part of the pre planning phase a social scientist and engineer&#13;
undertakes a prefeasibility study to assess need/demand for water supplies and source yields.&#13;
Need is measured in terms of time savings and demand in terms of user willingness to&#13;
contribute and participate. The cost of prefeasibility studies is presented in para 28.&#13;
19.    Planning Phase (US$ 5.70 million): The focus is on group building, self investigation,&#13;
problem solving and discussing options for water supplies and environmental sanitation&#13;
leading to the formulation of a community action plan (CAP) as a proposal for implementation&#13;
phase financing. The role of SO staff is to build capacity and facilitate the active participation&#13;
of women, confirm demand and willingness to contribute to project costs, and take&#13;
responsibility for operation and maintenance. During this phase 15% of the beneficiary&#13;
population would be trained in participatory CAP and monitoring in addition to training&#13;
targeted to women/tapstand groups and VWSC members (see Table I). Gender issues will be&#13;
incorporated in all project interventions. VWSC generally consists of 7-12 members, hence&#13;
on average 10 VWSC members will be trained per village. For HESA activities at least 2&#13;
women from each tapstand /women's group will be trained. The number of sessions/training&#13;
activity and intensity will vary from village to village and will depend on scheme size and&#13;
need. Project support covers the cost of SO staff for capacity building, HESA, and WDI&#13;
activities, training provided by the SO.&#13;

20.    SO staff inputs per village will vary depending on scheme size and complexity but the&#13;
mix of skills required will be the same for all. Project support will include the salaries of (i) a&#13;
Community Facilitator (CF) with a high school diploma and experience in community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 6 of 13&#13;
development work; (ii) a Community Worker (CW) with a high school diploma and&#13;
experience in hygiene and sanitation issues; (iii) a Community Development Supervisor (CDS)&#13;
with at least a graduate degree in social sciences and minimum 2 years experience in&#13;
community development and/or community water supply and sanitation; (iv) a team leader&#13;
with at least a graduate degree and minimum 2 years experience with community development&#13;
and! or community water supply and sanitation; and (iv) an accountant with a degree in&#13;
commerce and at least 2 years accounting experience. SO staff inputs on average include 12&#13;
months/village each of the CF and CW at Rs 500/month (recruited from project areas), 3-5&#13;
months/village of CDS at Rs 8000/month. The inputs of the team leader and accountant is&#13;
estimated at 0.5 months/village at Rs 10000 and Rs 6000 respectively. SO staff input is&#13;
highest in the planning phase.&#13;
21.   A 13% drop out rate is expected between the planning and implementation phase.&#13;
Hence the number of villages that will be developed during the Planning Phase each year is&#13;
124, 276, 375 and 375. The total SO staff cost for developing 1150 villages is US$ 2.22&#13;
million.&#13;
22.   Implementation Phase (US$ 4.01 million). The total number of villages that will be&#13;
supported for the Implementation Phase is 108, 242, 325 and 325 in 4 batches. In this phase&#13;
responsibility for community organization and strengthening is shared equally by the VWSC&#13;
and SO staff. In order to enable the VWSC to carry out its functions effectively trainings at&#13;
the village level focus on those skills needed to implement and manage schemes for long term&#13;
scheme sustainability; effective use of improved water supplies through HESA; and training&#13;
to enable women to take advantage of time savings through the WDI component.&#13;
23.   Training to VWSC members will focus on the roles and responsibilities of the VWSC&#13;
and SO, community monitoring and procurement issues. At least one village treasurer/village&#13;
will receive training on simple book/record keeping to enable the VWSC to maintain its book&#13;
of accounts. HESA activities will be targeted to traditional birth attendants, village elders and&#13;
school teachers with special emphasis on beneficiary women. The project provides funds for&#13;
training at least 3 primary school teachers/village, at least 2 women from each&#13;
tapstand/women's group or 2 women from each hamlet. HESA trainings and small&#13;
workshops will center on personal and domestic hygiene and environmental sanitation, latrine&#13;
options and drainages. SO staff will assist NFE participants and/or tapstand groups to&#13;
establish linkages with other organisations for income generation activities, explore options&#13;
and identify skill enhancement training. Project support includes the salaries of SO staff,&#13;
training to project beneficiaries (see Table I above). The cost of the training for the&#13;
Implementation Phase is US$ 2.03 million.&#13;
24.   Staff composition and qualification is similar to those specified for the planning&#13;
phase. SO role is expected to be phased down during the latter part of the implementation&#13;
phase (post implementation) as the VWSC assumes full responsibility for its water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation schemes and other complementary community development&#13;
initiatives. Total SO staff cost for assisting the communities in implementing schemes in&#13;
1000 villages is US$ 1.98 million.&#13;

25.   Construction of Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Facilities for&#13;
Sinele and Regional Schemes (US$50.50 million): Design activities occur in the planning&#13;
phase and all construction activities occur in the implementation phase. Each geographical&#13;
region (Hills, Foot hills and Bundelkhand) has costs for:&#13;
(a)   survey, design and construction assistance'&#13;
(b)   water supply system including spring/stream gravity, tubewells with&#13;
handpumps/electric pumps, and stream pumping in the Hills and Foothills, and&#13;
tubewells with handpumps/electric pumps in the Bundelkhand. As this&#13;
program develops, more options will be introduced,&#13;
(c)    catchment protection including establishing tree nurseries, reforestation,&#13;
alternative energy sources to fuelwood, erosion control, and other site specific&#13;
programs which protect the water sources and ensure long term yield;&#13;
(d)   drainage systems are included in each village as a means of source protection,&#13;
mosquito control and disease control;&#13;
(e)    human waste disposal based on latrine construction. Efforts to develop&#13;
alternative means of waste disposal will be explored;&#13;
(f)    environmental management to look at overall village cleanliness such as solid&#13;
waste disposal, mosquito control, and wasteland reclamation; and&#13;
(g)   construction monitoring by the Service Agencies (SAs).&#13;
26.   The first year program is based on single schemes covering one or two villages. The&#13;
construction activities in regional multi-village schemes will be defined in a regional&#13;
development plan during the first 12 months of this project. The program aims to expand the&#13;
technology options in all regions and develop new and innovative approaches to long term&#13;
water and sanitation services.&#13;
27.   The project would support village water supply schemes (built to a high standard of&#13;
works in adherence to the specifications as would be set in the technology manuals ) that meet&#13;
the Government of Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) basic service level which is : (i) an average of&#13;
250 houses per standpost, (ii) maximum horizontal carrying distance of 1.6 km and maximum&#13;
vertical carrying distance of 150 m, (iii) the per capita domestic daily water demand served&#13;
through a standpost /tubewell of 40 liters. Provision via private connections at the rate of 70&#13;
liters per capita is possible if the consumer is willing to pay Rs. 1000 as connection fees. The&#13;
design period for all systems is 20 years. Operation and Maintenance costs are based on&#13;
routine maintenance and all replacement costs over the 20 year design life of the scheme.&#13;
28.   Pre-Planning Phase (US$ .17 million). This includes the inputs from an engineer, a&#13;
junior engineer and a social scientist from the Support Organization to carry out a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 8 of 13&#13;
prefeasibility study for each village. As part of the Pre-Planning Phase, source flow rates will&#13;
be measured by the Support Organization to determine the low flow dependable yield which&#13;
will be confirmed by the Project Management Unit through site appraisals. The Support&#13;
Organization cost will only be reimbursed for those villages selected for the Planning Phase by&#13;
the Project Management Unit.&#13;
29.   During this phase it is estimated that 5 days per person for each village of the&#13;
following Support Organization staff would be required: (i) a community development&#13;
supervisor holding a graduate degree in Social Sciences with two years of community&#13;
development experience or having passed high school but with ten years experience in&#13;
community development and (ii) a Junior Engineer (overseer) with a Diploma in Civil&#13;
engineering with 5 years of experience in water supply and/or sanitation.&#13;
30.   Planning Phase (US$ 1.45 million). This covers the cost of Support Organization&#13;
staff to do a detail survey, design water and sanitation facilities, develop an environmental&#13;
management plan with the community, provide technical training and coordinate with the&#13;
community development supervisor and community facilitator to assist the community in&#13;
selecting appropriate technologies.&#13;
31.   The SO staff inputs and qualifications during this phase are: (i) 3 to 6 months per&#13;
village of a junior engineer/overseer with a diploma in Civil Engineering and at least 5 years&#13;
of experience in water supply and/or sanitation at Rs. 6,000 per month; (ii) I to 3 months per&#13;
village of a senior engineer with at least a graduate degree in Civil Engineering; preferably&#13;
with a post graduate Master's degree in public health or environmental engineering or in&#13;
environmental sciences, at Rs. 15,000 per month; and (iii) 20 to 90 days per village of a&#13;
Coommunity Technician from the community. Both the senior engineer and junior engineer&#13;
shall have a combined minimum of 10 years of experience in at least two of the following:&#13;
community development, public health or environmental sciences.&#13;
32.   A 13% drop out rate between the Planning Phase and the Implementation Phase is&#13;
anticipated. Therefore, 1150 villages serving an initial population of about 902,900 persons&#13;
are budgeted for development. Table 2 lists the number of villages and the population served&#13;
in each batch in the Hills, Foot hills and the Bundelkhand area.&#13;

33.   Detail construction activities and costs are as follows:&#13;
(a)  Construction Assistance by the Support Organization staff( US$ 2.04 million!.&#13;
The per village inputs, in single village schemes, of the SO staff during this phase&#13;
include: 3 to 6 months of a Junior Engineer, I to 2 months of a Senior Engineer&#13;
and 20 to 90 days of a community technician. The qualifications of these&#13;
personnel are the same as those specified under the Planning Phase.&#13;
(b) Water supply (US$ 28.80 million). During the Implementation Phase the&#13;
construction, augmentation and rehabilitation of all water supply scheme design&#13;
activities carried out in the Planning Phase are executed. Broadly, the type of&#13;
village schemes in the Hills and Foothills comprise largely of (a) gravity piped&#13;
water systems with spring/stream sources. A typical village piped water system&#13;
would have an intake structure, a roughing filter, a transmission main with break&#13;
pressure tanks, valve and valve chambers, a reservoir, distribution mains and&#13;
public standposts and/or private connections; (b) tubewells with handpumps or&#13;
electric pumps including the cost for drilling a well up to 120 meters, providing&#13;
drainage protecting the well head and installing a Mark III handpump or electric&#13;
pump for wells greater than 60 meters; and (c) Stream/river pumping including&#13;
intake structure, filtration, pump, distribution system, reservoir, public standposts&#13;
and/or private connections. In Bundelkhand, typical water systems would&#13;
include tubewell with handpumps and small scale piped water systems with&#13;
components similar to the Hill piped water system, except such system would&#13;
possibly have a larger number of ground water pumping than surface water&#13;
sources.&#13;
(c) Catchment protection (US$ 0.57 million). The objective of catchment protection&#13;
is to ensure that the water sources will provide long term yield. These activities&#13;
will protect the water source by preventing contamination from surface&#13;
pollutants, potentially recharging the source and preventing erosion and siltation&#13;
in surface sources. The costs for these activities are based on a quote from&#13;
Himalayan Study Circle Pithoragarh defining the cost for community tree&#13;
plantation on about 5 ha of land upstream of the source managed by the users.&#13;
The Bundelkhand and Foothill populations are larger and the cost per village has&#13;
been adjusted accordingly.&#13;
(d) Drainage (US$ 5.69 million). For proper disposal of the waste water from water&#13;
systems the project will support well designed and reasonable construction of&#13;
sullage drains and community drains. Costs are based on 0.5 kilometers of&#13;
drains per village in the Hills, 1 kilometer per village in the Foothills, and 2&#13;
kilometers of drains per village in the Bundelkhand. The project supports the&#13;
development of new techniques, in addition to standare sullage and community&#13;
drains, for safe disposal of drainage water. These techniques include but are not&#13;
limited to irrigating agriculture land, drainage to tree nurseries or cattle troughs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 11 of 13&#13;
and developing ponds for fisheries. All techniques will be integrated into the&#13;
Village Environmental Action Plan.&#13;
(e) Human waste disposal (US$ 9.42 million). The project is budgeted to support&#13;
the construction of demonstration latrines as well as the construction of&#13;
household latrines for a 50% coverage. Human waste disposal is very much&#13;
related to the HESA component. The project first uses the HESA activities to&#13;
inform and motivate the community on the issues of sanitation (including human&#13;
waste disposal). Sanitation is considered essential in protecting the water sources&#13;
and obtaining the health benefits from safe water supply. Because of this, this&#13;
project aims to ultimately achieve full coverage (waste disposal facilities for each&#13;
family) through the CAP process. The time to achieve this may extend past the&#13;
life of this project. This project will utilize the most appropriate sanitation&#13;
technology for the area, taking into consideration environmental issues such as&#13;
soil conditions, water table and distance to water source. The waste disposal&#13;
component cost is based on an average cost per latrine of Rs. 3700. The&#13;
community is not limited to latrine construction, however, latrines are considered&#13;
to be the facility upon which the base cost is derived. Beneficiaries will bear any&#13;
additional costs for more expensive facilities.&#13;
(f) Environmental management (US$ 0.32 million). Environmental management&#13;
includes the cost for environmental improvements and protection such as&#13;
constructing filtration structures before community ponds to prevent&#13;
eutrophication, tree planting around ponds to decrease the impact of evaporation,&#13;
mosquito and fly breeding control (such as removing places for water to pond&#13;
and introducing larvae feeding fish in the larger ponds), solid disposal such as&#13;
composting. Additional technologies shall be explored such as cooperative cattle&#13;
sheds with generation and resource recovery of wastes (biogas, compost, etc.),&#13;
and incorporating environmental projects with women groups for economic&#13;
activities (such as tree nurseries, fisheries, and kitchen gardens. Again, because&#13;
the population is larger in the Foothills and Bundelkhand, the cost for&#13;
environmental management has been adjusted accordingly. The project will&#13;
support this component by undertaking studies as required since information is&#13;
found to be very limited on this subject .&#13;
(g) Construction monitoring (US$ 2.04 million). The cost for Service Agencies to&#13;
monitor construction activities on behalf of PMU is estimated at 5% of the total&#13;

objectives;&#13;
(a) Project related studies necessary for project implementation,&#13;
(b) Studies necessary for long term strategic planning and Sector Development&#13;
36.    Project Related Studies ( US$  1.04 million):&#13;
(a) Regional Schemes: A study would be conducted to review the economic,&#13;
technical, financial and institutional feasibility of regional schemes. The study will&#13;
also identify the implementation model and scheme cycle to be followed for the&#13;
regional schemes to ensure their sustainable operations.&#13;
(b) Technical Options and Local Environmental Management: To expand and&#13;
improve on technical options in all construction activities. Review surface water&#13;
conservation and ground water recharge techniques currently followed in UP,&#13;
other Indian states and in other countries and recommend feasible technical&#13;
solutions and delivery systems for implementation in the project villages. Studies&#13;

will also be undertaken to determine how to achieve the greatest sanitation&#13;
coverage in a village.&#13;
(c) Support to Private Rural Initiatives: The project will support studies, pilots, field&#13;
testing and dissemination around particular themes such as women's development&#13;
in water and sanitation services, environmental management, O&amp;M and&#13;
organizing approaches for regional schemes.&#13;
(d) Time Saving Study: A short study will be carried out to assess whether significant&#13;
numbers of water supply schemes are likely to meet the initial viability criteria set&#13;
up for the Project.&#13;
(e) Other Studies: to be identified.&#13;
37.   Long term Strategic Planning &amp; Sector Development ( US $ 1.42 million)&#13;
(a) Next Project Preparation: towards the end of the project, GOUP will prepare a&#13;
follow-on project of a larger size for seeking a possible World Bank financing .&#13;
This will include identification of project area, the project design and&#13;
implementation strategy, cost estimates and undertaking pre- planning activities in&#13;
the first batch of villages.&#13;
(b) Long Term Policy Formulation: The development of rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation sector in Uttar Pradesh would require long term planning and significant&#13;
policy reform to improve sector performance. The project will undertake a major&#13;
policy study including analysis of experiences from the project to assist&#13;
formulation of policy and a long term development plan.&#13;
(c) Water Quality Monitoring and Leak Detection Studies: A study will be&#13;
undertaken to review the current water quality monitoring mechanisms in the rural&#13;
water supply schemes and recommend mechanism for pilot implementation which&#13;
should promote private sector capacity in water quality testing and identify&#13;
practical approaches to necessary corrective actions by the communities. The&#13;
project will also support a pilot operation to develop and demonstrate leak&#13;
detection and repairs techniques suitable for small rural piped water systems.&#13;
(d) Statewide Media campaign: A major media campaign will include production and&#13;
airing of a feature video film on gender issues and sanitation needs in a dramatic&#13;
format; 8 short video spots and 16 radio spots. those spots will focus on a number&#13;
of core sanitation behaviors and related social issues. In conjunction with&#13;
broadcasts on TV and radio, multimedia kits will be produced (in print and photo&#13;
format) for schools and distributed on a statewide basis, with intensive focus on&#13;
the Hills, Foot hills and Bundelkhand.&#13;

Uttar Pradesh Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project&#13;
Desien Criteria&#13;
Introduction: The project incorporates an interactive planning process involving&#13;
communities and support organizations and supports the&#13;
construction/rehabilitation of 1000 rural water and environmental sanitation&#13;
schemes serving a design population of about 1.17 million in the Hills, Foot hills,&#13;
and Bundelkhand regions.&#13;
2.    The design criteria represents the design parameters recommended in the Uttar&#13;
Pradesh Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project. The&#13;
Technology manuals (which will be completed satisfactory to the Bank before&#13;
planning phase contracts are signed) will contain detail designs for each technology&#13;
catagorized as water supply, drainage, human waste disposal, environmental&#13;
management and catchment protection. The design criteria relating to&#13;
environment, health, safety, operation and maintenance and technology will be&#13;
more clearly defined in the technology manuals. The design criteria in this annex&#13;
refers primarily to know water supply and sanitation technologies. Design Criteria&#13;
for catchment protection and environmental management require more&#13;
investigation. There will be on-going studies to expand the technology options&#13;
for all technology categories. All design criteria shall meet the environmental&#13;
criteria listed in Annex 18.&#13;
3.    Water Supply: The project supports the construction/rehabilitation (making use,&#13;
where feasible, structures/pipelines of existing systems that meet or are&#13;
rehabilitated to meet the technical standards) of schemes that meet the eligibility&#13;
criteria defined in annex 15. The broad types of schemes in the Hills and Foot hills&#13;
comprise of:&#13;
a)    gravity schemes (open/closed) with spring/stream sources designed and&#13;
operated for continuous supply;&#13;
b)    electric pumping schemes from spring/stream sources;&#13;
c)    hand pump schemes from groundwater sources; and&#13;
d)    catchment schemes from rainwater sources.&#13;
4.    The first year schemes in the Bundelkhand region shall be single village schemes.&#13;
A study will be conducted during the first year to determine the feasibility and&#13;
methodology for doing regional schemes. Typical schemes in the Bundelkhand&#13;

Electric Pump Schemes        Provide storage to minimize pump operation. Storage size&#13;
depends on the design population and pump capacity.&#13;
Rain Catchment Schemes       Those catchments which only augment the water supply&#13;
(Supplementing existing water  during the dry months should provide at least 2 months of&#13;
system)                      storage depending on the reliability of the existing water&#13;
system and the projected need.&#13;

17.   Catchment Protection: The project would support catchment protection like tree&#13;
planting to provide safeguards against erosion/surface water runoff due to tree&#13;
felling and pollution of sources. All of these technologies will be defined in detail&#13;
in the technology manuals.&#13;
18.   Environmental Management: This project would support environmental&#13;
management type projects including surface water protection, fuelwood&#13;
alternatives, mosquito control, solid waste management, and other projects. All of&#13;
these technologies will be defined in detail in the technology manuals.&#13;
19.   Drainage: Drainage systems in the Hills are limited to short drains to prevent&#13;
ponding and erosion or gully washing. Drainage in the flatter areas are more&#13;
substantial and will provide good drainage during the majority of the year.&#13;
a)     Runoff will be calculated by the rational method (Q= 10 cia)&#13;
b)     The drainage may be open channel or curtain drain type and the shape shall&#13;
depend on the hydraulics of the area.&#13;
c)    The slope and drain geometry shall be designed to maintain gravity flow&#13;
and a scouring velocity of at least 0.6 m/s in open drains.&#13;
d)    Where necessary, filters or screens shall be place to prevent debris from&#13;
clogging the drains.&#13;
e)    Curtain drains shall be filled with coarse sand or pea gravel. The will be an&#13;
advantage in areas which require deeper cuts, at road crossings or where&#13;
land is not available for open channel construction.&#13;
f)     The drains shall discharge through soakage trenches, ponds, and natural&#13;
water bodies.&#13;
g)    Treatment (i.e. filtration) maybe necessary if sullage is a potential threat the&#13;
drinking water supply.&#13;
20.   Sanitation: Sanitation construction shall depend on type and bearing capacity of&#13;
soil, soil porosity, rate of infiltration, depth of excavation possible using manual&#13;
means, and depth to groundwater table. Alternative methods of waste treatment&#13;
are being considered. Standard pit latrines shall be based on the following:&#13;
a)    they shall be lined with stone, brick or concrete rings where there is a&#13;
danger of collapse,&#13;
b)    slabs shall be directly over the pit or offset, and raised above ground level&#13;
on a stone or brick base to prevent surface water from entering the pit,&#13;
c)    slabs for simple pit or VIP latrines shall be constructed from stone with&#13;
mud bedding and pointing supported by timber or bamboo spanning the pit,&#13;
from planks cut from hard and insect resistant timber, or from ferrocement&#13;
or reinforced concrete;&#13;
d)    slab for pour-flush latrines shall be of standard design suitable for flushing&#13;
with one to tow liters of water;&#13;
e)    superstructures shall be built from local materials such as stone or bamboo&#13;

Terms of Reference for Development Plan for Regional Schemes&#13;
I.    The UP Rural Water Supply Project has identified a potential need for the&#13;
construction and or augmentation of regional piped water supply. There is a need to define&#13;
the institutional framework and viability of regional piped water. The primary objective is&#13;
to determine the feasibility of doing regional schemes area and, if these schemes are found to&#13;
be feasible, identify the best mechanisms and methodology for implementing them.&#13;
Approach&#13;
2.    The overall approach is determining the feasibility of regional piped water schemes&#13;
and ultimately developing a plan for their implementation is based on 12 month of&#13;
consultancy accomplishing the following activities:&#13;
Phase I - Gathering Information: (6 months)&#13;
(a)    Government Policy and Institutional Framework - Identify the government&#13;
policy and institutional history in the delivery of water systems to rural areas.&#13;
(b)    Case Studies - Look at 10 existing regional piped water schemes from both&#13;
surface and groundwater sources (attempts should be made to find both well&#13;
functioning and problematic systems). Describe the following:&#13;
*  General scheme description (i.e. system description, number of&#13;
villages served, number of persons served, liters per capita, capital&#13;
costs, and operational cost);&#13;
*  Institutional framework for the design, construction, and operational&#13;
phases including any obstacles and limitations of these institutions;&#13;
*  User reaction (i.e. do people find these systems to be affordable, are&#13;
they using them or are they using traditional sources, are the systems&#13;
reliable, do these systems create a net health improvement or is there a&#13;
negative impact from poor sanitation?);&#13;
*  Other water sources in the community and the reliability of these&#13;
systems. Are the local sources, if any, being depleted? If so, why?&#13;
*  Other options for water supply, if any, and the comparison with the&#13;
regional piped water schemes. The comparison will include system&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 14&#13;
reliability, affordability (during both the construction and operational&#13;
phases), environmental impact, social impact(including land&#13;
acquasition and affected persons issues), user preference and&#13;
willingness to pay.&#13;
(c)    Regional Schemes Feasibility Report - Based on the case studies, summarize&#13;
the findings. Identify weaknesses in the delivery of the regional piped water&#13;
schemes and suggest mechanisms to overcome these weaknesses. Determine&#13;
if the community can maintain these systems (such as through government&#13;
institution via tariffs, private maintenance contracts, or community&#13;
maintenance). Describe any characteristics of systems which seem more&#13;
sustainable (i.e. Does the number of villages per scheme make a difference?&#13;
Are there technologies which seem to minimize maintenance?). Identify any&#13;
elements which, under current policies or institutional framework, would&#13;
make these types of systems unfeasible. Identify the time requirements to&#13;
develop a sustainable regional program.&#13;
Phase II - Prepare a Development Plan for Regional Piped Water Schemes (6 months)- If&#13;
regional piped water schemes are deemed feasible, a development plan shall be prepared.&#13;
(a)    Development Plan - Identify a reasonable plan which fits with the overall&#13;
philosophy, goals and framework of the Rural Water and Environmental&#13;
Sanitation Project. Specifically identify:&#13;
* Institutional framework, rules of various government agencies and&#13;
private sector and mechanisms for strengthening these agencies so they&#13;
can implement regional schemes.&#13;
*  Feasible types of works (i.e. maximum number of villages per scheme)&#13;
*  Types of systems which are capable of being maintained either because&#13;
of affordability or simplicity in operation.&#13;
*  Eligibility criteria for local communities, contracting agencies, NGOs&#13;
and local government institutions. This includes environmental and&#13;
social measures required. Social measures shall include any&#13;
resettlement.&#13;
*  Develop a policy framework for addressing negative project impacts on&#13;
affected persons, in conformity with the Bank Guidelines on&#13;
Resettlement. This policy framework should include types of potential&#13;
impacts and categories of affected persons; their entitlements and&#13;
assistance by the project; and systems of consultation and grievance&#13;
procedures. Where indigenous groups are affected, particular measures&#13;
should be taken to ensure that tribals receive cultrually compatible&#13;
social and economic benefits.&#13;
* Methodology for implementation&#13;
&#13;

* Scheme cycles&#13;
(b)   Manuals - Prepare the following components to insert the program manuals.&#13;
The format shall follow the sarne format as the program manuals:&#13;
*  Operational Manual Component (the operations manuals should&#13;
incorporate a generic action plan for addressing social impacts,&#13;
particularly in relation to involuntary land acquisition and indigenous&#13;
groups.)&#13;
*  Technical Manual Component&#13;
*  Environmental Mitigation Component&#13;
*  Training Component&#13;

Terms of Reference for Study on Expanding Technology for the Supply or Water and&#13;
Environmental Sanitation Technical Options for Communities&#13;
1.    Study Objective: This study will investigate the variety of options for long term&#13;
sustainable water supply and sanitation by expanding the menu of technical options.&#13;
Currently the technology options are limited to traditional wells, spring, and surface water&#13;
catchment for water supply; latrine construction and lined drains for sanitation; and tree&#13;
planting for catchment protection. The goal is to provide the technical options which will&#13;
ensure long term sustainablility.&#13;
2.     Topics: The following will be the topics of study:&#13;
a)     Micro level Watershed Protection and Water Resources Management&#13;
i)    Reforestation - Methods of reforestation using indigenous species rather&#13;
than imported pine and eucalyptus. The use of grasses as a means of&#13;
primary succession and slope stabilization. Review incentives for&#13;
community management by looking at economic benefits from forest&#13;
products and the growth of commercial crops in forests (i.e. bee keeping,&#13;
lentil production, and fuel wood production).&#13;
ii)    Decreasing the dependence onfuel wood - Providing alternatives to fuel&#13;
wood use such as increasing propane distribution, biogas digester, solar, and&#13;
mini-hydro. Looking at more efficient stoves including solar cookers and&#13;
insulated ceramic or mud stoves.&#13;
iii)    Erosion control - Slope stabilization with riprap, gabions, and natural&#13;
vegetation such as grasses or trees.&#13;
iv)    Watershedprotectionfrom pollution - Protection of sources (both for&#13;
groundwater and surface waters) from agricultural and domestic pollutants&#13;
such as cattle waste, human waste, pesticides, fertilizers, and oil. This is a&#13;
non-hardware approach, for example using landscaping with specific plants&#13;
around agricultural areas to filter agricultural pollutants, using organic&#13;
farming techniques, or composting cow manure in appropriate places.&#13;
Hardware approaches such as latrine construction and biogas digesters&#13;
should be integrated with this component.&#13;
b)    Water supply technologies&#13;
i)    Rain Catchment - Rain catchment may be a viable alternative to expensive&#13;
pumping technologies. This study will explore the various options from roof&#13;
catchment in individual households to community systems. The advantages&#13;
and disadvantages of tank technology including water jars, ferro-cement&#13;
tanks, plastic tanks, underground tanks with hand pumps, and large land&#13;
catchment holding ponds will be considered. Issues such as mosquito&#13;
breeding in the clean water tanks and potential for fish rearing in the larger&#13;
ponds will be reviewed.&#13;
ii)    Alternative pumping technologies - Mini-hydro, solar, wind and biogas&#13;
pumping systems will be reviewed for their viability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
Page 5 of 14&#13;
iii)    Well headprotection - Construction techniques (i.e. drainage, concrete&#13;
covers, and well seals) which prevent contamination of sources will be&#13;
reviewed.&#13;
c)     Environmental protection and sanitation&#13;
i)     Toiletsfor specific types of environments - The environments where toilets&#13;
are installed might be in difficult environmental conditions with seasonally&#13;
high ground water, rocky soils, clay soils, or high population densities. The&#13;
construction of a typical latrine might contaminate water sources. This&#13;
study will look at appropriate technology options for specific environments&#13;
and develop guidelines and procedures for site evaluation. Soil investigation&#13;
procedures, site selection based on distance from water sources and soil&#13;
types, and in areas without adequate soil types technology options are the&#13;
focus of this component.&#13;
ii)    Drainage - Drainage water often contains contaminants from human waste,&#13;
livestock waste, and solid waste. Filtration systems (either vegetation or&#13;
media filters) prior to surface water ponds, streams, rivers, or other water&#13;
bodies will be investigated. Pond construction and integrated fisheries may&#13;
be an option in areas without adequate elevation change. These ponds could&#13;
provide a good drainage basin and possibly support fisheries.&#13;
iii)    Solid waste disposal - Solid waste can also impact water sources. As&#13;
communities grow and develop, solid waste problems will increase. Setting&#13;
up solid waste programs before they are a problem helps provide long term&#13;
sustainable environmental protection. Composting and cattle waste disposal&#13;
will be investigated. Recycling plastic, especially for environmental uses&#13;
such as composting bins, toilets, and erosion protection devices, will be&#13;
reviewed.&#13;
3.     Procedure:&#13;
a)     Divide the TA into two regions, Bundelkhand and Hills. Review all technologies&#13;
existing in Uttar Pradesh by interviewing NGOs, donor organizations, community&#13;
technologies, and government organizations. (2 months)&#13;
b)     Expand on these technologies with appropriate national and international&#13;
technologies. (I month)&#13;
c)     Develop pilot designs and monitoring parameters. Meetings with NGOs and&#13;
assessment of technology needs will be basis of technology selection. The pilots&#13;
will be implemented in existing schemes and introduced in the CAP process as&#13;
potential alternatives. (Imonth)&#13;
d)    Implement pilot projects with eligible communities based on the communities&#13;
willingness to use the new approach. The pilot will use the existing frame work of&#13;
the NGOs (including community development specialists) to integrate into the&#13;
Community Action Plan Process (CAP). (9 months)&#13;
e)     Develop technical and training manuals. (3 months)&#13;
&#13;

4.     Pilots: Each year, for two consecutive implementation phases, twelve pilots will be&#13;
implemented and tested for viability. There will be a total of 24 pilots. During subsequent years&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of the pilots will be carried out by the LJNDP water and sanitation&#13;
program. The pilots will be selected based on the sample technologies and community need as&#13;
expressed in the CAP. Only communities who want to try the new technologies and show they are&#13;
willing to pay for the system. Because the systems are new to the area, additional technical support&#13;
will be provided.&#13;
a)     Sample pilots: Some examples and approaches of pilot schemes include the&#13;
following.&#13;
i)     Areas with dwindling forestry and obvious impacts on the watershed:&#13;
*  review the existing vegetation and soil conditions;&#13;
look at alternative locations for fuel wood production, i.e. planting trees&#13;
in between agricultural spaces;&#13;
*  look at alternative fodder supply from forest litter and trees especially&#13;
with multiple uses i.e. planting fodder trees and plants in between&#13;
agricultural spaces. planting fodder trees in forests or fodder grasses to&#13;
protect against erosion;&#13;
e  look at alternative fuel supplies such as solar, propane, or mini-hydro.&#13;
*  decreasing cattle population; and&#13;
e  provide method of slowing down rainwater runoff so that water can&#13;
percolate to the aquifer and replenish the groundwater.&#13;
ii)    Areas with contaminated sources - protect the sources from contamination&#13;
by:&#13;
*  identifying and eliminating upstream sources of pollution;&#13;
e  providing drainage around the source to prevent runoff from&#13;
contaminating the source; and&#13;
*  providing the proper forms of sanitation.&#13;
iii)    Areas with groundwater sources with pollution potential from surface water&#13;
runoff:&#13;
*  provide a well seal; and&#13;
*  provide a well cover and ring for protection.&#13;
iv)    Areas without adequate water supplies or with only expensive options such&#13;
as pumping.&#13;
*  look at alternative means of pumping; and&#13;
*  look at rain catchment for individual housed or large communal systems.&#13;
v)     Sanitation pilots for areas with unsuitable soils.&#13;
5.     Output: Individual Reports on technology. Technical and Training Manuals for the&#13;
specific technologies with schedule costs. These manuals will be incorporated with the each of the&#13;
existing manuals including:&#13;

pictures and technology options should be prepared for the community.&#13;
b)    Prefeasibility Manual - This manual is a precondition for prefeasibility&#13;
training. The manual is a guide for the SOs in the field. A training module&#13;
for the Prefeasibility Manual should be prepared in addition to the manual.&#13;
The prefeasibility manual contains:&#13;
i)    Description ofprefeasibility Study - The purpose of the prefeasibility&#13;
study is to determine the scheme eligibility to enter into the planning&#13;
phase and provide the information necessary to write a planning phase&#13;
proposal.&#13;
ii)    Preliminary Map - This Section shows how to produce a basic&#13;
scheme map.&#13;
iii)   Source Flow Measurement and Evaluation - Describes how to do&#13;
source flow measurements for a variety of source types and a&#13;
procedure for determining the quality of the source.&#13;
iv)   Preliminary Designs and Costs - Based on the village map, a few&#13;
types of schemes are identified and costed. The costs are based on&#13;
simple costs for pipe per meter, number of tanks, number of wells,&#13;
number and types of pit latrines for the soil conditions, length of&#13;
drains, area of reforestation, etc. A form (spreadsheet available to SOs&#13;
with computers) with a simple format for quick costing for a particular&#13;
scheme type. This is a very basic method of costing based on very&#13;
simple calculations. This section will be updated with new estimated&#13;
costs for the new technologies.&#13;
v)    Examples of Prefeasibility&#13;
vi)   Planning Phase Proposal&#13;
c)    Feasibility Manual - The feasibility manual provides guidance for design and&#13;
decision making on the community level. The feasibility manual is the&#13;
technical component of the CAP process and enables the community and the&#13;
SO to continue on to the design phase. This manual is the basis for the first 25&#13;
day technical training and a technical training component should be prepared.&#13;

i)    Description of Feasibility Report - The purpose of a feasibility report&#13;
is to develop a list of options, with the participation of the community,&#13;
on a variety of community development issues including water supply,&#13;
sanitation, catchment protection, environmental management, and&#13;
economic development. With this the community can compare the&#13;
implications and their willingness to pay for a percent of the capital&#13;
costs, operation and maintenance, quality of service, time savings,&#13;
health benefits, economic benefit, and environmental improvement.&#13;
ii)    Detailed Survey and Mapping - Techniques on detailed survey and&#13;
mapping will be presented here.&#13;
iii)   Base Line Survey on Environmental Parameters for Village&#13;
Environmental Action Plan (VEAP)&#13;
*  Land use in the watershed (e.g. agricultural use, free grazing of&#13;
livestock, forest, etc.), and visual estimate of present erosion;&#13;
e  Vegetation cover: abundance per species, percent cover per&#13;
species;&#13;
e  Economic use of the watershed: fuelwood kg/ha and fodder kg/ha&#13;
and others;&#13;
-  Number of springs and dry season flows in liter per second (1/s) in&#13;
May;&#13;
*  Groundwater levels in May and after the monsoon in October;&#13;
-  Initial water quality and follow-up measurement on an annual or&#13;
bi-annual basis at the start of monsoon (water quality is reported to&#13;
be worst during this period).&#13;
e  An estimate should be made how much groundwater is available&#13;
and what are the sustainable groundwater and surface water yields&#13;
from the watershed; and&#13;
-  Rainfall and stream flows originating from the concerned&#13;
watershed ought to be measured by the communities, as a part of&#13;
the local environmental and micro level water resources&#13;
management component.&#13;
* Health Parameters&#13;
iv)   Community Design Process and Costing This is an overview of how&#13;
to develop designs for the community. It describes how to identify the&#13;
needs of the community and develop strategies for design. With the&#13;
detailed mapping, community participation, and better knowledge of&#13;
the area, community designs can be more accurately developed. The&#13;
designs include designs for the community water system, sanitation&#13;
program, environmental management, and catchment protection&#13;
program. The SO assists the community by increasing their awareness&#13;
of several technical options so the community can choose what is best&#13;
for them. Once three to five basic options have been designed the SO&#13;
shall recalculate the cost implications to the community. The method&#13;
of costing is the same as in the prefeasibility study. All schemes&#13;
&#13;

3.     Monitoring and Evaluation: Each system will be monitored and evaluated. The&#13;
evaluation will be based on the baseline survey in the Village Environmental Action Plan (VEAP),&#13;
changes to the community and cause and effect of the changes. They will document the institutional,&#13;
social, and physical conditions and compare with other technologies. Conclusions on what makes a&#13;
technology successful or causes it to fail will be documented. Adjustment to the program design will&#13;
reflect the successes and failures of the pilots.&#13;
* Year I and 2 (6 months total for 4 consultants, technical, social, environmental, and&#13;
health) - Collect data from the VEAP and establish a baseline for each village.&#13;
Document the social structure of the communities including literacy rate, women&#13;
participating in the program, number of SC/ST and how they fit in the community, and&#13;
other pertinent social parameters. Document the Institutional framework of the&#13;
community (i.e. was the community highly organized to begin with, what were there&#13;
institutional setup, who participated in the Village Water and Sanitation Committee, who&#13;
was responsible for maintenance, and how were collection of funds handled).&#13;
*  Year 2, 3 &amp; 4 (9 months total for 4 consultants; technical, social, environmental, and&#13;
health) - Update the baseline survey and monitor the quality of the systems and evaluate&#13;
how well they are integrated (i.e. does catchment protection, solid waste disposal,&#13;
erosion control, drainage and/or sanitation adequately protect the source?)&#13;
*  Year 5 - Write up conclusions and make recommendations to improve the technology&#13;
designs and the way they are implemented.&#13;

Terms of Reference for Study of Sector Policy and Strategic Plan&#13;
Background&#13;
I .    The Government of Uttar Pradesh (GOUP), through a Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU) under the Rural Development Department is planning to undertake a rural water and&#13;
sanitation project supported by the World Bank. A component of the project is to a prepare a&#13;
State wide Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Policy and Strategic Plan that will form the&#13;
basis for future development in the sector. It is intended that the Policy and Strategy Plan will&#13;
be issued as a draft policy paper by mid 1998 with a view to adoption by end 1998.&#13;
Objective&#13;
2.    The objective is to develop a rural water supply and sanitation development policy&#13;
and strategy for the State that would ensure sustainability of investments in services and&#13;
maximise both social and economic benefits. This would be based on shifting from the&#13;
present approach to a demand driven approach to service delivery. Central to this, is&#13;
increased community and non-government sector (NGOs, Community Based Organisations,&#13;
private sector, informal sector) participation in the development and operations and&#13;
maintenance of systems, decentralisation of management to the lowest appropriate level, cost&#13;
sharing, and a more effective facilitating and regulatory role for the State including water&#13;
quality monitoring.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.    The PMU will be responsible to prepare the strategy and policy document. The PMU&#13;
will be supported by national and international consultants as required. It is envisaged that&#13;
short term consultant inputs will be required from institutional, technical, social and&#13;
financial/ economic specialists. These consultants should be used to facilitate the preparation&#13;
process and drafting the various reports.&#13;
4.    The Department of Rural Development will establish an inter agency Steering&#13;
Committee consisting of representatives from the various sector interest groups including&#13;
Departments of Rural Development, Agriculture, Health, and Panchayati Raj, plus&#13;
representatives/stakeholders from the non governmental sector. The steering committee will&#13;
advise the PMU on important policy issues, review the inception, interim and draft final&#13;
reports and generally manage the preparation process. The composition of the Steering&#13;
Committee shall be discussed with the World Bank before inception of the study.&#13;

Scope of Works&#13;
5.    It is envisaged that the study would be undertaken in four steps;&#13;
a)    First, an in-depth review that will determine the existing situation, performance&#13;
and status of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation sector. This review will&#13;
include but not be limited to aspects related to; institutional, legal, and&#13;
regulatory frameworks, sustainability, service coverage, investments and&#13;
external support, technology, the role of communities, of the government and&#13;
the non governmental sector.&#13;
b)    Second, from the basis of the situation analysis a clear understanding of the&#13;
issues and bottlenecks constraining sector development would be established.&#13;
This will include but not be limited to regulatory issues, financial and&#13;
institutional arrangements, and inappropriate technical and social standards and&#13;
practice.&#13;
c)    Third, the development of a clear policy statement and strategy of how to&#13;
address these issue constraining sector development. This would include&#13;
proposals for sector reform and reorganization, and;&#13;
d)    Fourth, a prioritised plan of action to implement the policy and strategy. This&#13;
would establish a time frame and a plan of specific actions.&#13;
Reporting and Documentation.&#13;
6.    It is envisaged that the study would be completed in nine months. Within four weeks&#13;
of commencing the PMU should present an Inception Report that would set out a plan of&#13;
action for undertaking the study and schedule of activities. These would be reviewed by the&#13;
Steering Committee and the World Bank. After four months of study and deliberation the&#13;
PMU would prepare and present an Interim Report to the Steering Committee and the World&#13;
Bank, the Interim Report would set out progress and preliminary recommendations,&#13;
unresolved issues and a plan of action for completing the work. After seven months the PMU&#13;
will prepare a Draft Final Report, to which the Steering Committee and the World Bank will&#13;
respond and comment within one month.&#13;
Consultant Inputs&#13;
7.    Nine months of a sector planner/institutional specialist, technical and&#13;
financial/economist inputs. Forty months of a social, financial, legal and technical specialists.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
Uttar Pradesh Rural Water SuDIV and Environment Sanitation Proiect&#13;
Social Assessment&#13;
1.           Uttar Pradesh with a per capita income of Rs. 2698 remains one of the&#13;
poorest state in India, despite efforts to alleviate poverty. It lags behind most social&#13;
indicators, and in addition there exists wide variations between districts in terms of&#13;
population density, literacy levels, infant mortality rate, female age at marriage, female&#13;
work participation rate and per capita income. The low male: female ratio (882 females&#13;
for 1000 males) suggests girls and women have less access to health care and education&#13;
The majority of the population are Hindus (83%) followed by Muslims (16%) and the&#13;
remaining 1% are Christians, Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs etc. Of the total population in UP&#13;
the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes constitute 25% and 0.2% respectively.&#13;
2.           The total fertility rate (TFR) is 4 in the hills and corresponds to a high&#13;
female age at marriage (18) and high female literacy rate (36%) while Bundelkhand has&#13;
the highest total fertilty rate (5) in the state, lowest female age at marriage (15) and low&#13;
levels of female literacy.  Infant mortality rate per 1000 live births is 1 19 for the&#13;
Bundelkhand and 90 for the hills. Population density per square kilometer is 1 15 for the&#13;
Hills and 229 for Bundelkhand. The female share of the labor force is primarily&#13;
concentrated in the agricultural sector.&#13;
3.           The hill areas are sparsely populated and communication is difficult and&#13;
many areas are accessible only by foot. Settlements patterns are dispersed in small&#13;
clusters of hamlets and are located at a considerable distance from another. Each hamlet&#13;
has a predominance of a particular caste such that the general castes are found in one&#13;
hamlet and scheduled castes in another. In villages that are "not covered" by improved&#13;
water supplies the general and scheduled castes/tribes have their own source (s) of water,&#13;
usually traditional unprotected wells and/or spring sources. In the Bundelkhand&#13;
communication/interaction between the general castes and scheduled castes is minimal&#13;
compared to the hills.&#13;
4.           Differences in the roles of men and women are governed by gender division&#13;
of labor such that women not only perform more tasks than men but their work is more&#13;
labor intensive compared to men.. These norms of hierarchy and gender division of labor&#13;
is more pronounced among the upper castes of Bundelkhand because of the purdah (veil)&#13;
system, which confine women to activities relating to the domestic sphere and men to&#13;
public activities. In these areas children in particular girls and women over 35 years are&#13;
more involved in water fetching tasks. In the hills the lack of economic alternatives to&#13;
largely subsistence agriculture have necessitated at least one adult male in every household&#13;
to migrate for work. While outmigration of male family members have increased the&#13;
overall workload of women and girls it has also resulted in shifting the locus of decision&#13;
making to women in terms of household and farm management.&#13;

5.           In the project areas women and girls are responsible for collecting water&#13;
fodder, fuelwood; food processing, cooking, other domestic chores, and childcare in&#13;
addition to tending to agricutural and animal husbandry activities- As a result shortages&#13;
in water supply is felt more acutely by women. In the dry season (April-June) as the&#13;
pressure of household activities increase due to reduced availability of water children in&#13;
particular girls are the first to be pulled out of school to help with household tasks.&#13;
6.          Women in rural areas suffer more from malnutrition, anemia and loss of&#13;
energy due to their heavy workload of which water fetching constitutes a major task. (3-4&#13;
hours per day on average). Loss of energy due to women's heavy work burden is&#13;
directly related to depletion in health conditions of women who already suffer from&#13;
inadequate nutritional intake. Poor rural women spend most of their lives in pregnancy or&#13;
lactation which increase nutritional requirements, hence women are under nutritional&#13;
stress. Women undertaking arduous tasks are more likely to be exposed to malnutrition&#13;
and anemia.&#13;
7.           Constraints. Time constraints stemming from women's role in household&#13;
and farm managment may limit their ability to participate in RWSES activities and&#13;
trainings. In the hills, because of time constaints, participating in village meetings may&#13;
take a back seat to the priorities of fulfilling household susbsistence needs, tending to&#13;
social relations and child care. Women generally do not have extra time, and even if they&#13;
want to participate they may be able to do so only by short cutting other household and&#13;
economic activities.&#13;
8.           One major contraint that woud be encountered is caste distinctions and&#13;
attitudes which govern social relations between general castes and scheduled castes/tribes.&#13;
9.          The attitude of men towards women's involvment would influence the&#13;
degree and level of woman's participation, particularly in the Bundelkhand. Most men&#13;
believe that women will not be able to contribute in village meetings as they are illiterate&#13;
or are too busy with childcare and/or housheold chores. The dichotomy between the&#13;
public and domestic sphere forces women to conform to accepted gender roles.&#13;
10.          Norms of conduct between women and men and between upper and&#13;
scheduled castes/tribes create communication barriers between male field staff and&#13;
women, and between upper and scheduled caste/tribes, particularly in the Bundelkhand.&#13;
Women's lower literacy level, reduced mobility, and less ability to speak in public&#13;
meetings inhibit them from participating in public forums.&#13;
II.          Mitigation Measures. The project anticipated that most villages would&#13;
lack technical skills and experience in cooperative actions such as planning, constructing&#13;
and managing common facilities. The scheme cycle spans 33 months and moves at a pace&#13;
according to community pace planning phase, during which SOs build capacity and&#13;
faciltiate project beneficiaries to develop a community action plan (CAP), and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

implementation phase, during which VWSC with SO support implemnt the CAP The&#13;
CAP process which is integrated with the hygiene and environment sanitation awareness&#13;
component (HESA) would increase options, increase their awareness of filth borne&#13;
diseases and ensure that scheme design and cost corresponf to user needs. To ensure that&#13;
all sections of the community participate the project has included complete village&#13;
coverage, a legally formed VWSC as criterion for scheme eligibility. 3 months provides&#13;
Support Organizations (SOs) the flexibility to organize/mobilize villages at a pace&#13;
appropriate to the local beneficairy group leading to the election of representative and&#13;
responsive VWSC.&#13;

Annex 13&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
sections of United Provinces Panchayat Raj Act 1947. It is binding that only one Joint Committee will&#13;
be formed for a Regional Scheme.&#13;
4.    There will be following members in this Joint Committee:-&#13;
I.    Chairpersons of all the  Village Level Water Supply and Sanitation     Member&#13;
Committees covering all the Gram Panchayats of a Regional Scheme.&#13;
2.    One SC/ST Member from each Village Water and Sanitation Committee      Member&#13;
3.    One Woman Member from each Village Water and Sanitation Committee      Member&#13;
5.    Chairman and Secretary cum Treasurer of Joint Village Water and Sanitation Committee will&#13;
be elected by the members of the Village Water and Sanitation Committees included in the scheme.&#13;
Preference will be given to women while electing the Secretary cum Treasurer for the committee.&#13;
Members of the Joint Committee will have equal rights and all the decisions will be taken on a&#13;
majority basis. In case of a dispute between the constituent committees of the Joint Committee, the&#13;
matter will be referred to the Prescribed Authority whose decision in this regard will be final.&#13;
6.    In case of Regional Schemes having more than 25 members an Executive Committee, for&#13;
facilitating decision making and functioning, will be formed by electing one member from each Gram&#13;
Panchayat in such a way that there is a minimum of 30 percent representation of women and 20&#13;

7.    Both the above kinds of committees can collect from villagers a voluntary community share&#13;
(by way of cash or labour) of the capital cost of construction works (Water Supply, Sullage Drains&#13;
and Household Sanitary Latrines) and also voluntary contributions for the operation and maintenance&#13;
of the facilities. These committees will also endeavour to promote health education among the&#13;
villagers. These committees will discuss and agree on the designs of the construction works so that&#13;
the facilities created could match what the user community desires. Help of voluntary organisations&#13;
could be taken up for fulfilling the above tasks. These committees will also be authorised to sign&#13;
necessary agreements/ contracts for implementing the project.&#13;
8.    The amount collected in the form of the community's cash contribution against the capital&#13;
costs of works and for operation and maintenance of the facilities will be kept in a separate account&#13;
opened in a local Bank or Post Office in the name of Village Water and Sanitation Committee/ Joint&#13;
Village Water and Sanitation Committee (as the case may be). The account will be operated by joint&#13;
signatures of Chairperson and Secretary cum Treasurer of the committee concerned.&#13;
9.    The Project Management Unit will take assistance from the voluntary organizations for&#13;
forming these committees. The Voluntary Organisations will start a series of community consultation&#13;
meetings which would result in community choosing its representatives for the committee.&#13;

Uttar Pradesh Rural Water SUPDlV and Environmental Sanitation Proiect&#13;
Eligibility Criteria&#13;
A. SuiDort Org-anization Eligibility Criteria&#13;
I.     The PMU would select Support Organizations according to the following criteria:&#13;
(a)    legal status: evidence of legal registration;&#13;
(b)    constitution: constitutional provision to engage in rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation service delivery and related activites;&#13;
(c)    track record: proven track record of at least three years experience in rural&#13;
water supply and sanitation (RWSS) or community development activities&#13;
evidenced by satisfactory completion of a participatory/demand driven project;&#13;
(d)    finance: accounts audited and certified by a chartered accountant,&#13;
(e)    staff: demonstrated staffing capacity to carry out the proposed services or&#13;
ability to procure such staffing capacity. (This includes adequate community&#13;
development and design and construction field level and supervisory staffl.&#13;
2.     Support Organizations are identified and pre-qualified during the Pre-Planning Phase. The&#13;
PMU/DPMU staff will ensure that the above criteria are met.&#13;
3.     In addition, during field visits, PMUWDPMU staff will conduct a review which would&#13;
include a detailed manpower assessment (with reference to staff needed for implementing the TOR&#13;
of SOs), the type and availability of existing staff to work on the project, and an assessment of&#13;
other resources which the SO could bring to the project. Discussion of financial tumover and&#13;
expected conmnitmnents will also be reviewed to determine the impact and level of schemes which&#13;
the SO would be capable of implementing. In order to further rank SOs, the following qualitative&#13;
scale will be used to assign points. SOs not achieving at least 65 points should be disqualified from&#13;
those meeting basic criteria. The criteria must be independently assessed by at least two staff, with&#13;
the average score used as the basis for decision making.&#13;
4.     The PMU will be responsible to shortlist Support Organizations. This shordist along with the&#13;
eligibility criteria will subsequently forwarded to the Chief District Officer (CDO) for review and&#13;
commnents. Once the PMU receives the CDO's comments it will proceed with the final prequalification.&#13;

5. Staff proposed by a pre-qualified Support Organization will be thoroughly assessed and evaluated&#13;
during a training orientation. Support Organizations whose staff have been evaluated as weak would be&#13;
required to propose other staff for the project penod as a condition fbr Planning Phase contract signing.&#13;
Qualified Support Organizations would then be required to undertake training in orientation to rural&#13;
water supply and sanitation concepts, and procedures and methods of participatory development.&#13;
Support Organizations would initially be hired only for the Planning Phase during which their&#13;
performance would be carefully assessed before signature of an Implementation Phase contract.&#13;
Assessment of Support Organization's performance would include information from the client&#13;
communities as well. In addition, SO perfornance in scheme account keeping would be audited by a&#13;
private auditor during the Planning Phase. A satisfactory audit of the Planning Phase would be a&#13;
condition for Inplementation Phase Cortract signing. Finally, both a technical and financial audit of the&#13;
full cycle would be carried out by a private auditor. A satisfactory audit would be required for SO pre-&#13;
qualification of the next batch of schemes.&#13;

B. Scheme Selection&#13;
6.     The Process for Scheme Selection: The underlying principle will be to select schemes on the&#13;
basis of transparent criteria including those for scheme demand, need, technical feasibility, economic&#13;
viability, and social and environmental soundness.&#13;
7.     Support Organizations (SOs) would be trained to conduct prefeasibility studies, which provide&#13;
information about the local conditions and proposed schemes which meet eligibility critena. SOs will be&#13;
given a maximum number of prefeasibility studies to submit based on an estimnation of their capacity to&#13;
undertake water supply and sanitation schemes. Usually these will amount to 15% more than they will be&#13;
expected to undertake in each cycle to allow for scheme dropout. SOs will initially conduct such studies&#13;
within the range of their existing work areas, or at least within areas where they have existing links and&#13;
capacity to provide support to communities. Every village prefeasibility study will be confirmed by a site&#13;
appraisal by the PMU/DPMUs. Upon successful completion of the Planning Phase, eligibility of&#13;
communities will be confirmed before proceeding with the Implemrentation Phase.&#13;
8.     The Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission has identified "not covered" (NC) habitations&#13;
through a major initiative to identify those habitations which have no publicly provided source within&#13;
certain parameters. These represent approximately 4% of UP villages (12% habitations). SOs will be&#13;
given district-wise lists of no source and partially covered (PC) habitations. SOs will give priority to NC&#13;
habitations within their working areas. Existing lists of partially covered (PC) villages will also be&#13;
provided as a starting point to help guide the SOs. SOs will also be free to identify other villages that&#13;
meet the same cnrteria of need, demand, social, technical, and economic parameters. The cnteria below&#13;
incorporate the Rajiv Gandhi Mission Criteria and add additional parameters with adequate social and&#13;
economic justification for schemes. Schemes that do not meet the eligibility criteria shall be dropped.&#13;
This should ensure that GOI's mandate is met and also provide the basis to select viable schemes. The&#13;
list of villages shortlisted by the SOs, according to the eligibility criteria, will be shown to the CDO who&#13;
will provide comments to the PMU/DPMU.&#13;
9.     Scheme Eli2ibility Criteria. The following eligibility criteria would be applied at each&#13;
phase (Planning and Implementation) in the scheme cycle using the information available at that&#13;
phase. Each scheme accepted for PMU financing would need to meet these criteria. During initial&#13;
operations, the following criteria and indicators would apply:&#13;
(a) Need (and Economic Viability)&#13;
(i)   Felt Need: which would be determined at Pre-Planning Phase by&#13;
ascertaining whether the average time saving expected per household per&#13;
day would be greater than 2 hours and 30 minutes (for piped water&#13;
schemes), 1/2 hour (for hand pump tubewells and other point sources), and&#13;
per capita scheme costs were below defined thresholds (Rs2000 for piped&#13;
schemes and Rs500 for handpump schemes); or&#13;
(ii) average per capita water availability of safe water is less than 15 liters/day&#13;
and per capita costs are within the thresholds referred to in (i) above; or&#13;
(iii) a majority of the households are dependent upon heavily polluted sources&#13;
and a scheme could provide cleaner water through protection of existing&#13;
sources or cost effective amelioration of existing sources in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
Bundelkhand/Plains and per capita costs are within the thresholds of (i)&#13;
above or&#13;
(iv) benefit/cost ratio over 1.5, using value of time savings or cost savings and&#13;
value of incremental water produced as benefits. The value of time saved&#13;
should be based on the market wage rate for unskilled labor in the local area&#13;
during non-harvest times.&#13;
(b) Technical Feasibility&#13;
(i)   Undisputed perennial source(s), water quality at the tap meets Indian&#13;
Standard (WHO guidelines) and the minimum yield of the proposed source&#13;
is sufficient to meet 40 Ipcd or demand (on the design population and&#13;
including leakage and wastage) and the house connection demand of at least&#13;
70 Ipcd, per GOI norms. Only if there is no other solution, and existing&#13;
sources are heavily polluted or provide under 15 lpcd, would a source&#13;
supplying 25 Ipcd be accepted;&#13;
(ii)  compliance to engineering standards and service levels with established&#13;
PMU standards.&#13;
(iii)  Appropriate mitigation measures for any adverse environmental impacts,&#13;
and appropriate arrangements for protecting or enhancing the source(s).&#13;
(c) Sustainability and Willingness to Pay&#13;
(i)   Capital Cost-Sharing Rules in Hill Districts:&#13;
10.    The community will pay, prior to the commencement of any construction works, a cash&#13;
payment of 1% of capital cost as evidence of commitment and an indicator of demand for services.&#13;
The village will contribute also by paying for all labor (by providing their own labor, cash or a&#13;
combination) for digging of trenches for all water supply pipelines. Those choosing house&#13;
connections will pay a cash fee of Rs 1000, with at least half paid before construction begins and&#13;
the remainder prior to commissioning and commencement of system operations. This fee will&#13;
cover the incremental capital costs of providing for the additional capacity above the basic&#13;
minimum service level. Amounts collected for these fees, prior to beginning construction will be&#13;
considered in the required 1% of capital cost.&#13;
(ii) Capital Cost Sharing Rules in Non-Hill Districts:&#13;
11.    The community will pay, prior to the commencement of any construction works, a cash&#13;
payment of 2% of capital costs, as in the Hill Districts. The community will make an additional&#13;
cash payment sufficient to cover 10% of total capital cost prior to the commissioning of the water&#13;
supply system. Villages benefiting from the project will pay for all the unskilled labor for the&#13;
construction of drainage works (by providing labor, cash or a combination). Those choosing house&#13;
connections will pay a fee of Rs 1000, on the same basis and time schedule as in the Hill districts.&#13;
Amounts of this fee collected prior to beginning construction will be considered in the required up-&#13;
front payment of 2% of capital cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
(ii) Operation and Maintenance Costs:&#13;
12.    Participating villages will decide who operates and maintains the facilities, but will bear&#13;
100% of operation and maintenance costs. A monthly fee will be regularly billed for meeting these&#13;
costs, beginning at the time of system commissioning and continuing on a frequency of no longer&#13;
than every three months. The monthly fee for house connections will be at least three times the fee&#13;
for standpost users. In pumping schemes, those with house connection will pay a monthly fee of at&#13;
least Rs 30 per month per connection and those with standpost service will pay a monthly fee of at&#13;
least Rs 10 per household. There will be a 5% surcharge on the monthly fee to establish a&#13;
maintenance fund.&#13;
(iv) Exceptions to Agreed Cost Sharing Rules:&#13;
13.    All of the villages eligible to participate in this project, by agreement between GOUP and&#13;
the Bank. are relatively poor and have an inadequate current level of service (less than 40 lcpd) or&#13;
have current water supplies which are dangerous to health. Moreover, most of the eligible villages&#13;
are located where it is relativelv expensive to provide adequate, acceptable quality services.&#13;
Consequently, the existence of these conditions is an insufficient basis, by itself, to justify an&#13;
exception to the above cost sharing rules. The rules are intended to apply to the vast majority of&#13;
the cases so that fairness will be maintained across villages which will benefit from the project.&#13;
14.    The implications of this is that exceptions should only be granted in a few cases where the&#13;
following criteria are met:&#13;
-  The population served includes a higher proportion of people whose income is below&#13;
the poverty level than the average for the eligible villages or a higher proportion of&#13;
tribal people and scheduled castes than the average for the eligible villages by at least&#13;
one and a half standard deviations above these averages (for example, if the average&#13;
level of people whose income is less than the poverty level is 40% and the standard&#13;
deviation among eligible districts is 10%, a village would have to have 55% of its&#13;
population below poverty level (i.e. 40+10+5=55) to qualify on this criteria and the&#13;
calculation for the other criteria are done in the same way); or&#13;
*  have higher costs per capita by at least one and a half standard deviations above the&#13;
average per capita cost of eligible villages for which the project technical designs have&#13;
been completed; and have costs which have been determined by project management to&#13;
be the least cost solution for meeting the projected village demand.&#13;
15.    If one of these criteria is met, project management may negotiate a reduction up to 1% (in&#13;
Hill districts) and 2% (in non-Hill districts) in the up front cash contribution to capital cost, subject&#13;
to Bank approval. In no case, should the fee for extra service provided by house connections or the&#13;
labor requirement be reduced for digging trenches for water supply pipelines in the Hill Districts or&#13;
for providing unskilled labor for drainage works in the Non-Hill Districts be reduced.&#13;
(v)  establishment of a single/regional legally recognized, representative Village&#13;
Water and Sanitation Committee (VWSC), comprising of at least 30 percent&#13;
women and 20 percent scheduled castes/scheduled tribes;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
(vi)  assurance, before the Implementation Phase, through a signed document,&#13;
from the VWSC and the Support Organization that there is complete&#13;
coverage within the revenue village, including surrounding hamlets that wish&#13;
to participate, and that all habitations within the revenue village which are&#13;
not now served will be served, including Scheduled Castes (SC) and&#13;
Scheduled Tribes (ST) habitations;&#13;
(vii) Communities with a high degree of discord or who cannot reach consensus&#13;
on all aspects of participation before the prefeasibililty phase, would be&#13;
ineligible to participate. Such a community must demonstrate that it has&#13;
overcome such difficulties if they desire to participate in future scheme&#13;
cycles. Community willingness for all the sustainability indicators would be&#13;
appraised before the Planning Phase, and actual cash contributions would be&#13;
deposited and formation of a legally recognized VWSC would be completed&#13;
before the implementation contract.&#13;
16.    As per GOUP policy, there are two levels of subsidies (Rs 2375 and Rs 2250) for pit&#13;
latrines; one for SC/ST and one for below poverty line households. The mission agrees with&#13;
GOUP's present subsidy levels for SC/ST and below poverty line people. The project will provide&#13;
subsidy to other people also but at a reduced level of Rs 1500 per unit&#13;
(viii) Environment Protection and Catchment Protection&#13;
17.    For each component that is implemented, the village will contribute a minimum of 10% of&#13;
the capital cost (in either cash or in kind).&#13;
(ix) Land Acquisition:&#13;
18.    Where private land is to be acquired to obtain access to water source(s) and/or for siting of&#13;
facilities, an agreement must be obtained between the VWSC and the owner agreeing to the use of&#13;
the land. (The cost of private land will be counted as part of the village cash contribution). Land&#13;
acquisition for single schemes will only be done on a voluntary basis and will be documented.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
Uttar Pradesh Rural Water SuDPly and Environmental Sanitation Project&#13;
Cost Recoverv Policv&#13;
The GOUP and the Bank have agreed on the following general policy:&#13;
The villages whuch benefit from the proiect will be responsible for approximatelv 10% of the&#13;
capital costs of water supplv and draz.a: ar! fv. all of thz zc  ra:;on ard -aintenance costs Tli,&#13;
Project (including the GOUP share of proiect costs) will finance the residual capital costs.&#13;
The capital costs are sigrificantly different in villages in eligible Hill districts and In other&#13;
eligible distncts Consequently. implementation of this general policy agreement requires the&#13;
development of slightlv different cost-sharing rules for the two types of villages. The water supply&#13;
systems have been designed to allow house connections, by permitting users who are willing to pay&#13;
the extra costs of the higher level of service from house connections to select this option. Thus,&#13;
implementation of the general policy agreement also requires different cost-sharing rules for those&#13;
choosing house connections and those who will be served from standposts.&#13;
Capital Cost-Shannng Rules in Hill Distncts&#13;
The commuruty will pav, pnor to the commencement of anv construction works, a cash&#13;
payment of 1% of capital cost as evidence of conumutment and an indicator of demand for services.&#13;
The village will contnbute also by paying for all labor (by providing their own labor, cash or a&#13;
combination) for digging of trenches for all water supply pipelines. Those choosing house&#13;
connections will pav a cash fee of Rs 1000, with at least half paid before construction begins and&#13;
the remainder prior to commissioning and commencement of system operations. This fee will&#13;
cover the incremental capital costs of providing for the additional capacity above the basic&#13;
minimum service level. Amounts collected for these fees, prior to beginning construction will be&#13;
considered in the required 1% of capital cost.&#13;
Capital Cost Sharing Rules in Non-Hill Districts.&#13;
The communit- will pav, prior to the commencement of any construction works, a cash&#13;
pavment of 2% of capital costs. as in the Hill Districts. The community will make an additional&#13;
cash payment sufficient to cover 10% of total capital cost prior to the commissioning of the water&#13;
supply svstem. Villages benefiting from the project will pay for all the unskilled labor for the&#13;
construction of draunage *works (by providing labor, cash or a combination). Those choosing house&#13;
connections will pay a fee of Rs 1000, on the same basis and time schedule as in the Hill districts.&#13;
Amounts of this fee collected pnor to beginning construction will be considered in the required up-&#13;
front pavynent of 2% of capital cost.&#13;
Land Costs&#13;
All public land acquired to implement the project will be provided free. Private land&#13;
acquired will be purchased at market rates by the villages. The cost of the pnvate land w ill be&#13;
counted as part of the village cash contribution.&#13;
Operation and 191aintenance Costs.&#13;
Participating villages will decide who operates and maintains the facilities. but w6ill bear&#13;
100% of operation and maintenance costs. A monthly fee will be regularlv billed for meeting these&#13;
costs, beginning at the time of s% stcm comirussioning and continuing on a frequency of no longer&#13;

than every three months. The monthlv fee for house connections will be at least three times the fee&#13;
for standpost users. In pumpung schemes. those with house connection will pay a monthly fee of at&#13;
least Rs 30 per month per connection and those with standpost service will pay a monthlv fee of at&#13;
least Rs 10 per household. There %vill be a 5% surcharge on the monthly fee to establish a&#13;
maintenance fund.&#13;
Exceptions to Agreed Cost Sharing Rules.&#13;
All of the villages eligible to participate in this project, by agreement betveen GOUP and&#13;
the Bank. are relatively poor and have an inadequate current level of service (less than 40 lcpd) or&#13;
have current water supplies which are dangerous to health. Moreover, most of the eligible villages&#13;
are located where it is relatively expensive to provide adequate, acceptable qualitv services.&#13;
Consequently, the existence of these conditions is an insufficient basis, by itself, to justify an&#13;
exception to the above cost sharing rules. The rules are intended to apply to the vast majority of&#13;
the cases so that fairness will be maintained across villages which will benefit from the project.&#13;
The implications of this is that exceptions should only be granted in a few cases where the&#13;
following criteria are met.&#13;
(1)    The population served includes a higher proportion of people whose income is&#13;
below the povertv level than the average for the eligible villages or a higher&#13;
proportion of tribal people and scheduled castes than the average for the eligible&#13;
villagzes by at least one and a half standard deviations above these averages (for&#13;
example, if the average level of people whose income is less than the poverty level&#13;
is 40% and the standard deviation anong eligible districts is 10%, a village would&#13;
have to have 55% of its population below poverty level (i.e. 40+10+5=55) to&#13;
qualify on this criteria and the calculation for the other criteria are done in the&#13;
same wav); or&#13;
(2)    have higher costs per capita bv at least one and a half standard deviations above&#13;
the average per capita cost of eligible villages for which the project technical&#13;
designs have been completed. and have costs which have been deternined by&#13;
project management to be the least cost solution for meeting the projected village&#13;
demand.&#13;
If one of these criteria is met, project management may negotiate a reduction up to 1% (in&#13;
Hill districts) and 2% (in non-Hill distncts) in the up front cash contribution to capital cost, subject&#13;
to approval of the Bank Mission. In no case, should the fee for extra service provided by house&#13;
connections or the labor requirement be reduced for digging trenches for water supply pipelines in&#13;
the Hill Districts or for providing unskilled labor for drainage works in the Non-Hill Districts be&#13;

The possibilitv of establishing uniform policies for user financing and management in the&#13;
Rural Water and Sanitation sector bx transfer of responsibilitv for all Rural Water and Sanitation&#13;
activities to RDD would bc wclcomed and encouraged by the mission. The current lack of&#13;
consistencv between existin(g sector policies and the policies which have been agreed for the project&#13;
makes it unlikely that the implementation of the project and its performance would be as successful&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

as it can be. The problem will be particularly serious In the project districts. The mission believes&#13;
that the best solution to this problem would be uniforrn statewide policies. In the event that such&#13;
policies cannot be agreed in the short term, the mission would receive assurances from GOI that it&#13;
supports the principles of the project, particularly as they relate to the project proposals for capital&#13;
cost-sharing bv beneficiaries and commnumty responsibility for all O&amp;M costs These prnciples&#13;
are expected to be endorsed by the new State Government as well.&#13;
As per GOUP policy, there are two levels of subsidies (Rs 2375 and Rs 2250) for pit latrines; one&#13;
for SC/ST and one for below poverty line households. The mission agrees with GOUP's present&#13;
subsidy levels for SC/ST and below povertv line people. The project will provide subsidy to othcr&#13;
people also but at a reduced level of Rs 1500 per unit&#13;
Environment Protection and Catchment Protection:&#13;
For each component that is implemented, the village Will contribute a miniimum of 10% of the&#13;
capital cost (in either cash or in kind).&#13;

Uttar Pradesh Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Proiect&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
Background - The main objectives of this project are (a) the supply of sufficient&#13;
safe drinking water; (b) environmental sanitation; and (c) improvement of&#13;
environmental and public health in the villages of two of the poorest areas of Uttar&#13;
Pradesh: the Hills and the Bundelkhand. To achieve this objective the project&#13;
supports a comprehensive community development component and training&#13;
program, which includes environmental sanitation education, health training,&#13;
training on latrine construction, training in watershed management, including&#13;
nursery management, source protection and technical assistance. Environmental&#13;
improvements lead to improved social and economic improvements (quality of&#13;
life), especially for women and children. Some of the main environmental and&#13;
health improvements include:&#13;
a)    Supply of sufficient safe drinking water through construction of sustainable&#13;
water supply schemes and protection of the sources through micro-&#13;
catchment protection;&#13;
b)    Time and energy savings for women and children by bringing water, and on&#13;
the longer-term fuelwood and fodder closer to the home;&#13;
c)    Reduced bacterial contamination due to controlled and safe disposal of&#13;
human wastes, will have positive health impacts over-time;&#13;
d)    Increased water supply for bathing, washing and cleaning and possibly&#13;
water supply for livestock and small-scale irrigation for horticulture, which&#13;
will improve the family incomes. The major limitation for the two last&#13;
activities, which are not financed under the project, will be the availability&#13;
of water during the dry season;&#13;
e)    Improvements in hygiene and sanitation, which together with improved&#13;
environmental sanitation will result in less public health hazards and&#13;
decreased incidence rates of water related diseases. This will provide more&#13;
energy and time for altemative economic activities and a higher quality of&#13;
life,&#13;
f)  - Improved ecological conditions in the watersheds will increase the water&#13;
availability, and improve the quality of the drinking water sources;&#13;
g)    Watershed reforestation and/or spontaneous forest regeneration together&#13;
with improved community based watershed management, which should&#13;
include controlled access for fodder and fuelwood collection and control&#13;
access of free livestock grazing and altemative supply of energy (LPG,&#13;
solar cookers, biogas digesters, improved clay ovens (smokeless chulas),&#13;
and pressure cookers) will over time improve the fuelwood and fodder&#13;
situation, and provide opportunities for other marketable products such as&#13;
fruits and processed fruit products;&#13;

h)    Spontaneous forest regeneration and/or reforestation of watersheds&#13;
together with improved community based watershed management, which&#13;
includes controlled access for fodder and fuelwood collection and control&#13;
of free livestock grazing, will increase over-time biodiversity and increase&#13;
the economic, social and environmental sustainability of these ecosystems.&#13;
2.    In the no project scenario, under which deforestation and erosion will continue, the&#13;
availability of drinking water for people and livestock will become worse than at&#13;
present, since desiccation (drying out) of the project areas will continue. This will&#13;
also have negative impacts on the availability of fodder and fuelwood and&#13;
undermine the livelihood systems of the Hills, Foot hills and the Bundelkhand. The&#13;
undermining of livelihood of systems will even further stimulate rural-urban&#13;
migration, which is already high at present, especially in the Hills. The project will&#13;
have a positive impact on the restoration of the livelihood systems in the project&#13;
areas.&#13;
3.    The environmental component of the project will be implemented through a&#13;
demand driven approach. An awareness campaign will create demand, which has&#13;
already been demonstrated in the project areas. The environmental component will&#13;
be implemented through the preparation of Village Environmental Action Plans&#13;
(VEAPs), which will be part of the Community Action Plans (CAPs). The VEAP&#13;
will be prepared and implemented by the villagers themselves, by means of a&#13;
participatory planning process, with the assistance of Support Organization (e.g.&#13;
NGOs and Community Based Organizations), an Environmental Specialist from&#13;
the District Project Management Units (DPMUs) and other staff in the (DPMUs).&#13;
4.    Water Resources: The major environmental and public health issues in the Hills,&#13;
Foothills and Bundelkhand are the availability of sufficient quantities of safe&#13;
drinking water, especially during the summer months, and the lack of&#13;
environmental sanitation.&#13;
5.    Hills and Foot Hills Water Quality and Quantity - The hill region has a number&#13;
of perennial rivers fed by snow melt and groundwater seepage. Most of the smaller&#13;
rivers are drying out during the post-monsoon period and the summer months&#13;
(pre-monsoon: April-May-June). The drying out of small rivers seems to have&#13;
aggravated by massive deforestation in the hills during the last 30 years. This&#13;
deforestation was mainly caused by commercial logging of the Forest Department,&#13;
logging by villagers for timber and fuelwood, extension of agricultural land,&#13;
overgrazing and excessive fodder collection. This massive deforestation has upset&#13;
the regional hydrological cycle. According to information during the monsoon the&#13;
runoff has increased considerably, damages to infrastructure and property have&#13;
dramatically increased, while drinking water scarcity during the pre-monsoon&#13;
months had increased significantly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
Annex 20&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
6.    Not much information is available about the water quality, especially pathogenic&#13;
contamination of the larger and smaller rivers. The little data available for springs&#13;
show relatively high COD concentrations between 16 and 32 mg/I, which indicates&#13;
organic pollution. The Total Coliforms numbers (MPN) are around 2,400, which&#13;
can be considered unsafe drinking water Organic loading and pollution with&#13;
hazardous chemicals seems still limited. Some of the smaller streams seem to be&#13;
more polluted, mostly organic loading. Pesticides and fertilizers use in the hills is&#13;
still very limited. River sediment loads during the monsoon are very high, caused&#13;
by natural erosion and because of human impacts on the vegetation. The drinking&#13;
water supplied from the large and smaller rivers needs to be treated to be able to&#13;
supply safe drinking water, one of the main objectives of the project.&#13;
7      Chlorination is not recommended, since the large fluctuations in organic loads&#13;
makes adequate dosing by the communities extremely difficult. The accent should&#13;
be on preserving the water quality by upstream interventions and effective locally&#13;
available and manageable low cost treatment techniques e.g. filtration or other&#13;
viable structure techniques to be identified during technology development.&#13;
8.     The groundwater reservoir in the upper part of the hills is very limited and that&#13;
because of the relatively shallow soils the groundwater is mainly stored in the&#13;
superficial layers. In the valleys and Foothills the groundwater potential is higher,&#13;
because of thick sediment layers. Observed groundwater levels in the valleys&#13;
varied from 5 to likely 10 meters.&#13;
9.     Since groundwater in the hills is likely mainly stored at shallow depths under&#13;
phreatic conditions (no protective impermeable layer), it is especially vulnerable to&#13;
pollution from the surface. This implies that the project should pay adequate&#13;
attention to the protection of the upstream micro-catchment area to be able to&#13;
supply safe drinking water. This implies that the activities in the micro-catchment&#13;
area have to be limited e.g. no open pit latrines, no pesticide and fertilizer use, no&#13;
grazing, no open air human defecation, no small-scale industrial activities and&#13;
preferably no human habitation.&#13;
10.   Changes in the ecology of the hill system, caused by massive deforestation in the&#13;
last decades, has upset the delicate hydrological groundwater balance, which&#13;
caused according to local sources increased surface water runoff and decreased&#13;
infiltration and groundwater recharge. Resulting in significant reduction of&#13;
perennial springs, which served as the local drinking water supply sources. In a&#13;
number of cases, according to local sources, reforestation with local tree species,&#13;
e.g. oak, restored the perennial springs.&#13;
11.   The project engages in micro watershed reforestation activities and protection of&#13;
these micro catchments in order to increase the availability and quality of drinking&#13;
water. People will likely construct tanks for small-scale irrigation for horticulture&#13;
in the rainy season or for farm forestry. This enhances the sustainability of land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 20&#13;
Page 4 of II&#13;
use and provides considerable economic benefits. According to SO sources, there&#13;
is a high demand for catchment tanks. The major limit will be the availability of&#13;
sufficient water.&#13;
12.   Afforestation of the micro-catchments will also increase the availability of fodder&#13;
and fuelwood, which will lessen the actual heavy burden of women. Other&#13;
activities which will reduce the pressure on the renewable forest resource base and&#13;
protect the availability of drinking water sources, are the stimulation of adequately&#13;
designed and constructed biogas plants and the set-up of LPG distribution centers&#13;
in the project areas.&#13;
13.   The communities, with the help of NGOs, should monitor and evaluate the impacts&#13;
of project activities on vegetation cover, species composition, water availability&#13;
and water quality from springs and groundwater, fodder and fuelwood availability&#13;
and erosion control.&#13;
14.   Bundelkhand Water Quantity and Quality - The rainfall pattern is highly&#13;
variable in the Bundelkhand even in the same locality. Evaporation in the&#13;
Bundelkhand is very high, which causes the rapid drying up of open reservoirs&#13;
during the months of April-May. Methods of reducing evaporation and artificial&#13;
recharge of groundwater resources should be investigated, as well as other&#13;
technologies. At present more than 70% of the net irrigated area is by canals. As&#13;
the canals are taken from reservoirs on rivers with very little discharge during the&#13;
summer months, there is a shortage of irrigation water during the summer months.&#13;
There are numerous surface water retention structures in this region. Irrigation is&#13;
confined entirely to the (post-monsoon) crops. The availability of water decreases&#13;
sharply after December and most of the wells are more or less dry by February. In&#13;
relation to water quality no data are available.&#13;
15.  '-In the typical granite terrains of the Bundelkhand region (Jhansi and Lalitpur&#13;
districts), groundwater is generally stored under phreatic conditions in a mantle of&#13;
the upper weathered region of the granite layer. The thickness of this layer varies&#13;
from at times zero on the hillocks and ridges to 10 meter in the lower valleys. The&#13;
depth of the groundwater varies from around 3 to 18 meters. The capacity of the&#13;
geological formation to retain groundwater for a complete cycle of wet and dry&#13;
months is limited. The present groundwater extraction does not indicate mining.&#13;
16.   Groundwater should preferably be preserved for drinking water supply purposes&#13;
during the rather frequent drought years (1985, 1987 and 1988). Groundwater&#13;
levels respond quickly to rainfall, but decline rapidly after the monsoon ends, since&#13;
groundwater escapes by way of river base flow and groundwater outflow. During&#13;
drought year groundwater recharge is not complete. During a normal monsoon&#13;
year the groundwater resources are completely recharged. Also in the&#13;
Bundelkhand watershed conditions should be restored to facilitate and maximize&#13;
groundwater recharge, especially during dry years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
Annex 20&#13;
Page 5 of I I&#13;
17.    Since groundwater occurs under phreatic conditions, it is prone to pollution from&#13;
the surface. Surface activities in recharge areas and around wells should be non-&#13;
polluting. The use of open pit latrines in these areas should be prohibited. Dry&#13;
closed latrines are preferred. A water quality monitoring program for well water&#13;
will be implemented&#13;
18.   In the lower part of Banda district the groundwater situation is completely&#13;
different. Many wells are fitted with two pumps, pumping twice as much as is&#13;
allowed and use it for irrigation. It seems that overpumping of groundwater for&#13;
irrigation is a problem. There is need for stricter groundwater management and&#13;
enforcement of legislation. UP has no groundwater legislation. Groundwater in&#13;
this area is much deeper and is pumped from the third aquifer. Irrigation wells are&#13;
constructed without seals, so that water from the surface and the higher aquifers&#13;
can pollute the deeper third aquifer. The pollution status of the third aquifer is&#13;
unknown. The groundwater seems to have a high iron content, which makes it less&#13;
suitable as a drinking water source. Other water quality parameters are unknown.&#13;
Sources in the hills dry up during the post-monsoon months, likely because of&#13;
watershed degradation. To improve the situation a similar approach as in the UP&#13;
Hills of improvement of the infiltration and water holding capacities of the upper&#13;
watersheds can be followed.&#13;
19.    Hills: Sanitation - In the hills, sanitation is almost non-existent. The project&#13;
envisages a large scale sanitation intervention. Inappropriate technologies or&#13;
construction practices might cause serious groundwater pollution, which is a major&#13;
drinking water source. Appropriate sanitation technology and construction&#13;
supervision has to be applied to avoid groundwater pollution in areas where it is&#13;
used as a drinking water source. Groundwater velocities might be faster than&#13;
anticipated because of shallow soils, so that pollution might show up faster in&#13;
springs, groundwater and small rivers.&#13;
20.   Bundelkhand: Sanitation - In the Bundelkhand districts of Jhansi and Lalitpur&#13;
the situation is almost similar to the situation in the Hills with respect to the&#13;
vulnerability of groundwater to surface pollution. Groundwater will often be taken&#13;
from the weathered and fractured granite, subsequently, the groundwater velocities&#13;
might be higher than anticipated and pollution occurring at a greater distance from&#13;
the wells might show up in the drinking water. Appropriate sanitation technology&#13;
will be applied in areas close to the drinking water wells. A water quality&#13;
monitoring component will be implemented to guarantee a safe water supply.&#13;
21.   The situation in Banda district is very different. Drinking water is taken from the&#13;
third aquifer. When drinking water supplies are located sufficiently away and&#13;
upstream from pit latrines, there seems to be little danger of pollution of drinking&#13;
water sources by pit latrines.&#13;

22.   Potential Negative Environmental And Public Health Impacts From&#13;
Construction and Source Tapping - There are potential negative environmental&#13;
and public health impacts associated with the delivery of water and sanitation&#13;
services in addition to the impacts discussed above. Some of these impacts have&#13;
become evident in other World Bank supported rural water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation projects. These potential negative impacts include:&#13;
a)    Contamination of spring source during development and construction;&#13;
b)    Induced erosion caused by pipe laying, general construction activities,&#13;
deforestation and improper drainage,&#13;
c)    Improper construction of latrines leading to unsustainable sanitation and&#13;
groundwater contamination;&#13;
d)    Improper construction of spring intake structure leading to short lived&#13;
water supply and possible destruction of the source;&#13;
e)    Potential for cross contamination due to improperly joined pipes, broken&#13;
valves or leaky tanks;&#13;
f)    Source tapping may deny water to previous users of the source not&#13;
connected to the scheme;&#13;
g)    Tapping of entire streams and springs causes downstream river beds to dry&#13;
up with consequent negative impacts on downstream users and&#13;
biodiversity. The eligibility criteria for source selection avoid these&#13;
problematic sources. The villagers only can obtain support if there is no&#13;
conflict in relation to the water source;&#13;
h)    Construction activities may induce deforestation and encroach on&#13;
undisturbed natural habitats at the spring intake structure, quarry sites and&#13;
pipe trenches. This may have impacts on water availability and water&#13;
quality and on the remaining natural forest habitats.&#13;
23   -Mitigation and Monitoring Plans - This project has taken great care to&#13;
incorporate environmental improvement programs including sanitation,&#13;
environmental management and catchment protection as part of the long-term&#13;
strategy for each community. Each community will produce a Village&#13;
Environmental Action Plan (VEAP) specific to the communities environment and&#13;
needs. The VEAP is a long-term plan to mitigate against existing and future&#13;
environmental problems such as source depletion, source contamination, health&#13;
and hygiene programs, fodder depletion, fuelwood depletion and solid waste&#13;
management.&#13;
24.   More detailed environmental impacts and mitigation measures are included in the&#13;
various training and technical manuals. Subsequent training and technical manuals&#13;
will continue to improve due to the built in monitoring and evaluation component.&#13;
A summary of mitigation measures incorporated into the Village Environmental&#13;
Action Plan and to be specified in the training and technical manuals is listed&#13;
below.&#13;

25.   Site Clearance and Earth MovinLe: Site clearance, including tree cutting, and&#13;
earth moving during site selection and construction of intake structures, reservoirs,&#13;
and pipe laying can leave the affected area prone to erosion The steep slopes and&#13;
monsoons amplify the impact&#13;
a)    To avoid the monsoon season, the project has planned construction only&#13;
during the dry season,&#13;
b)    Vegetation and tree felling will be restricted to the minimum;&#13;
c)    Construction, tree cutting and removal of vegetation on steep slopes will&#13;
be avoided or minimized;&#13;
d)    Soils will be properly compacted after backfilling and replanted;&#13;
e)    Alternative siting will be considered for system components to avoid&#13;
encroachment on wildlife, natural habitats and sensitive ecosystems,&#13;
f)    The project includes tree planting or revegetation with other plants, e.g.&#13;
grasses, to protect intake structures from pollution and erosion. This will&#13;
be done at all sites prone to erosion or pollution, where earth moving and&#13;
site clearance occurs,&#13;
g)    Unstable slopes will be avoided for quarrying of construction materials,&#13;
because of the potential for landslides and damage to vegetation along&#13;
footpaths and hillsides, which increases erosion;&#13;
h)    Excavated material will be graded and replanted;&#13;
i)    Residues of construction materials will be taken back to the village;&#13;
j)    In case oil or other chemicals are used on the construction site, careful&#13;
handling is required and residues will be taken back to the village, in order&#13;
not to pollute the water source.&#13;
26.   Improper Drainare: Erosion and waterlogging due to improper drainage of&#13;
overflow from water supply systems and leakage water from leaking pipes might&#13;
occur. Improper drainage design and maintenance undermine the construction&#13;
components such as concrete tanks and pipes. Erosion around these concrete&#13;
structures destabilizes the foundation and exposes pipes and tanks to increased&#13;
weathering or possible decomposition by UV light in the case of PVC pipes, which&#13;
decreases the structural integrity and diminishes the lifetime of the water supply&#13;
system.&#13;
a)    Poor drainage from tapstands and handpumps increases localized ponding&#13;
of water, which increases the unhealthy conditions around the taps or&#13;
pumps and which augments the health risks of the population. Stagnant&#13;
drainage water is a breeding ground for bacteria and disease transmitting&#13;
mosquito vectors such as malaria, filariasis and others. Additionally, well&#13;
water is more susceptible to contamination from polluted surface water&#13;
run-off&#13;
b)    Adequate designed and constructed sanitary storm drains around the water&#13;
supply structures must be maintained. The community health and education&#13;
program as well as the village maintenance worker training incorporates&#13;
the need and the know-how for maintaining functional drainage systems,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 162 -&#13;
Annex 20&#13;
Page 8 of I I&#13;
c)    Washing and livestock drinking facilities will be installed a safe distance&#13;
down hill from the tapstand to avoid cross contamination. The Community&#13;
Action Plan will assess the need for such facilities and incorporates them in&#13;
the design,&#13;
d)    Adequate drainage for overflow and washouts from the water supply&#13;
system components should be provides;&#13;
e)    Drainage from tapstands and handpumps must drain to a safe place such as&#13;
near a field, kitchen garden or soakaway. They should be sufficiently long&#13;
to reduce the health risks and have an adequate capacity. By no means&#13;
should these drains discharge into village ponds, since they carry&#13;
pathogenic organisms, while village ponds are often used as source of food;&#13;
f)    New drainage routes will be avoided.&#13;
27.   Source Selection and Tapping: Source pollution due to improper design and site&#13;
selection poses a serious environmental health problem. Contamination may be&#13;
caused by bacteria and other pathogenic organisms, fecal matter disposed uphill or&#13;
upstream, agricultural chemicals, other hazardous chemicals such as oil and others.&#13;
a)    Other impacts of source tapping include changes in natural vegetation and&#13;
reduction of water availability downstream for humans, livestock and&#13;
wildlife. The occurrence of these impacts should be carefully evaluated at&#13;
the time of water source selection.&#13;
b)    Procedures for testing water quality, such as presence/absence of bacteria,&#13;
or the test tube total and fecal coliform tests, some basic drinking water&#13;
quality parameters such as iron or fluoride, arsenic, nitrate and others will&#13;
be investigated in conjunction with the sanitary inspection at the source;&#13;
c)    Proper location and design of intake structure to ensure protection from&#13;
pollution and the possible inclusion, if needed, of an effective basic, but&#13;
easy to maintain treatment system such as a filter;&#13;
d)    Sources must be non-disputed sources and the interests of downstream&#13;
users must be protected;&#13;
e)    Catchment recharge areas should be protected from deforestation and&#13;
certain uses of chemicals such as pesticides, oil and others, to protect water&#13;
quantity and quality. To avoid future water source depletion the recharge&#13;
catchment should be kept under an adequate vegetation cover, which&#13;
should include trees. These issues are explained in the training programs.&#13;
28.   Latrine Construction and Sanitation: Improperly designed latrines which do not&#13;
consider soil type, water table or drainage patterns, could pollute groundwater and&#13;
surface water sources. Poor soils for pit latrines include clay soils, which do not&#13;
drain and rocky soils, which drain too quickly. Since clay soils are impermeable&#13;
and do not drain, pits built in clay soils can be flooded, which transports sewage to&#13;
the surface. Pit latrines built in these soils form a health hazard, which is not the&#13;
objective of the project and have in general a much shorter lifetime. The impact is&#13;
two fold: First, pathogens are brought to the surface exposing persons to diseases;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 163 -&#13;
Annex 20&#13;
Page 9 of 11&#13;
second, persons who traditionally defecate in the open fields will have negative&#13;
connotations towards pit latrines and go back to unsanitary habits.&#13;
a)    In quick draining soils, like rocky soils, the liquid waste drains too fast,&#13;
which does not allow the bacteria enough time to effectively breakdown&#13;
the solid fecal matter. Moreover these soils, since the groundwater travels&#13;
fast and the resident time needed for pathogenic organisms to die off is&#13;
strongly reduced, which means that the groundwater downhill can become&#13;
seriously polluted with pathogenic organisms. This is a public health hazard&#13;
which has to be avoided, specially if the groundwater downhill is used as&#13;
drinking water source, but also if the pathogen loaded groundwater comes&#13;
at the surface downhill in the form of seepage water it forms a public health&#13;
hazard. The project has build in mechanisms to avoid these impacts.&#13;
b)    Siting of latrines and the selection of the technology must be based on a&#13;
site analysis, which should consider soil type, depth of the water table,&#13;
drainage patterns and the direction of groundwater flows in the area. The&#13;
golden rule is that no water sources should be selected downstream from&#13;
nearby latrines,&#13;
c)    Training on latrine siting and the choice of technology for different&#13;
environmental conditions will be carried out,&#13;
d)    The project incorporates environmental sanitation education to explain the&#13;
link between human waste and diseases and clarifies the need for proper&#13;
disposal.&#13;
29.   Desien and Construction: The quality of design and construction of systems is&#13;
paramount in delivering long lived schemes. If the intake structure collapses after&#13;
one year, the intended environmental health benefits are not sustained. The&#13;
breakdown of systems such as leaky tanks, broken or cut pipelines and broken&#13;
handpumps, usually means loss of available water per capita, which is in conflict&#13;
with the objective of the project.&#13;
a)    It is essential that the quality of the design and the construction remains at&#13;
the highest possible standards and that standards improve with time;&#13;
b)    The monitoring program will provide feedback on which system works best&#13;
and where, which problems were found and what were the reasons for&#13;
these problems, e.g. poor concrete mixture, improper curing, poor&#13;
maintenance, or lack of community involvement;&#13;
c)    The project has developed a set of technical manuals and technical training&#13;
manuals to improve design and construction quality. These manuals and&#13;
training modules must reflect lessons learned in previous construction&#13;
years, based on the monitoring program. This process of lessons learned&#13;
and feed back into the training manuals should be a continuous process;&#13;
d)    Location of livestock stalls shall be a minimum of 20 meters from any&#13;
water supply structure. in order to maintain sanitary conditions around the&#13;
water source.&#13;

30.   Induced Development and Water Use: Improved access and increased supply of&#13;
water, together with improved economic conditions, because of small-scale&#13;
irrigation, has resulted in induced development. People do not migrate out&#13;
anymore, but stay in their village and people who migrated before return. This will&#13;
result in higher population densities than actual carrying capacity of the project&#13;
areas. This will have impacts on water demand, and increased pressure on the&#13;
natural resource base, such as forest and fodder resources. The ultimate result is&#13;
that all scarce natural resources, including water, will be scarce. Community&#13;
education and planning must consider these issues.&#13;
31.   The Village Environmental Action Plan (VEAP): The VEAP is a long term&#13;
program for improving and protecting the community environment. The Support&#13;
Organizations (SOs) will assist the community in developing their VEAP during&#13;
the Community Action Plan (CAP) process. Each VEAP will reflect the&#13;
individual needs of the community and provide the bases for the environmental&#13;
management component and catchment protection component of this Project. The&#13;
VEAP includes the following components:&#13;
a)    a detailed Village Map of the existing situation;&#13;
b)    a base line survey of Environmental Parameters;&#13;
c)    detail environmental programs;&#13;
d)    detail designs, which will be constructed during the implementation phase;&#13;
and&#13;
e)    a projected Village Map with environmental improvements.&#13;
32.   Village Map: The Village map will show the existing environmental condition of&#13;
the community such as forested/deforested areas, ponds, rivers, streams, water&#13;
sources, agricultural land, hamlets, garbage dumps, manure drying, and general&#13;
gradients. The map will identify pollutants (i.e. from garbage, cattle manure, or&#13;
oil) and the impact to the environment (i.e. contaminated groundwater).&#13;
33.   Baseline Survey on Environmental Parameters: The baseline survey and the&#13;
Village Map represent the existing situation in the village and provide the&#13;
community with a record to compare any changes. The following parameters will&#13;
be surveyed:&#13;
a)    Land use in the watershed (e.g. agricultural use, free grazing of livestock,&#13;
forest, etc.), and visual estimate of present erosion;&#13;
b)    Vegetation cover: abundance per species, percent cover per species;&#13;
c)    Economic use of the watershed: fuelwood kg/ha and fodder kg/ha and&#13;
others;&#13;
d)    Number of springs and dry season flows in liter per second (1/s) in May;&#13;
e)    Groundwater levels in May and after the monsoon in October;&#13;
f)    Initial water quality and follow-up measurement on an annual or bi-annual&#13;
basis at the start of monsoon (water quality is reported to be worst during&#13;
this period).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

g)     An estimate should be made how much groundwater is available and what&#13;
are the sustainable groundwater and surface water yields from the&#13;
watershed, and&#13;
h)     Rainfall and stream flows originating from the concerned watershed ought&#13;
to be measured by the communities, as a part of the local environmental&#13;
and micro level water resources management component&#13;
34.    Baseline Survey on Health Parameters: Based on information from health clinics&#13;
and the community&#13;
a)     Diarrhea (various forms, including cholera and gastro-enteritis)&#13;
b)     Various worm diseases (e.g. Ascaris, Trichuris, Ancylostoma and others),&#13;
c)     Skin diseascs (e.g. skin infections caused by washing with polluted or insufficient&#13;
water: water wvashed diseases)&#13;
d)     Other diseases related to deficient water supply of low quality and lack of basic&#13;
sanitation. such as typhoid and hepatitis&#13;
e)     Malaria and other water-borne diseases.&#13;
3 5.   Detailed Environmental Programs: Once the community has gone through the&#13;
CAP process and decided on their action plan, they will develop a detailed&#13;
description of their environmental program. Programs define goals and a&#13;
framework on how to achieve them. Typical programs might include:&#13;
a)     clean-up campaigns;&#13;
b)     surface water protection;&#13;
c)     mosquito control;&#13;
d)     sanitation,&#13;

This also represents the maximum time savings, in terms of dry season equivalents,&#13;
that can be captured through the project.&#13;
Even in the wet season approximately 25% of all household water&#13;
requirements are still obtained away from the household. This is mainly for drinking&#13;
and cooking as water for animals and crops can be obtained from rainwater.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Uttar Pradesh Rural Water Supply and
            Environmental Sanitation Project has the following two main
            objectives: 1) to deliver sustainable health and hygiene
            benefits to the rural population through improvements in
            water supply and environmental sanitation services, which
            will increase rural incomes through time savings and income
            opportunities for women, test an alternative to the current
            supply driven service delivery mechanism and promote
            sanitation and gender awareness; and 2) to promote the
            long-term sustainability of the rural water supply and
            sanitation sector by providing assistance to the government
            of Uttar Pradesh to identify and implement an appropriate
            policy framework and strategic plan. The project's
            components are as follows: 1) strengthening and operation of
            the project management unit; 2) selection and construction
            of water supply and environmental sanitation facilities for
            single and regional schemes; and 3) studies and sector development.
