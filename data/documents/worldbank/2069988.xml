achieved by: (i) financing the non salary recurrent expenditures&#13;
of the core social service-delivery ministries of health,&#13;
education and higher education, and social affairs, as well as&#13;
other ministries whose operating non-salary budgets the&#13;
Ministry of Finance is unable to finance; and (ii) financing the&#13;
operating costs of the project implementation unit within the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, and any other essential technical&#13;
assistance needs identified by the participating ministries.&#13;

Second Emergency Services Support Project (ESSP II)&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
I.    Background&#13;
1.    With the launching of the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process in September 1993, the&#13;
hope of resolving one of the past centuries' most intractable conflicts was set in motion. An&#13;
ambitious reconstruction effort was initiated with broad donor economic support to underpin&#13;
the political process and jump-start the Palestinian economy. Because of its still unresolved&#13;
political status, however, the Palestinian govemance framework remains undetermined,&#13;
allowing for very limited Palestinian control of land, and lack of control over water, transport&#13;
of goods and people or access to extemal markets. Since the Oslo agreements, the Palestinian&#13;
Authority (PA) has begun to acquire jurisdiction in varying degrees, in the small areas under&#13;
its control, for delivery of public services, law enforcement and legislative power. It has not,&#13;
on the other hand, the full attributes of a state and is limited in its ability to authoritatively&#13;
allocate or mobilize resources.&#13;
2.    Reemergence of Conflict Sets Back Development &amp; Economic Growth. The&#13;
outbreak of the Palestinian Intifada in September 2000 and subsequent imposition of closures&#13;
and curfews by the Govemment of Israel on the West Bank and Gaza have caused many of&#13;
the development gains achieved over recent years to suffer severe setbacks. The nature of the&#13;
conflict has been one of low-level but protracted violence that has continued over a span of&#13;
more than two years. The Palestinian economic recovery that began in 1998 came to an&#13;
abrupt halt with the outbreak of violence, as political instability and security concems have&#13;
driven investors away, while closures and curfews have imposed significant transaction costs&#13;
on Palestinian businesses that have eroded their competitiveness.  Correspondingly,&#13;
Palestinian incomes have witnessed a sharp decline. Per capita real income in WBG declined&#13;
by 12 percent in 2000 and by a further 19 percent in 2001. Unemployment is now estimated&#13;
by the Bank to be just under 50 percent, and this does not include that portion of the labor&#13;
force that has ceased looking for work due to depressed economic activity.&#13;
3.    Fiscal Crisis. PA fiscal accounts have deteriorated markedly since September 2000,&#13;
causing a severe fiscal crisis. There are essentially three main causes of the present fiscal&#13;
deficit. First, there has been a sharp decline in PA revenue collections associated with the&#13;
decline in economic activity and the disruption of tax administration; second, transfers of tax&#13;
revenue collected on the PA's behalf by the Govemment of Israel were suspended during the&#13;
period December 2000-June 2002, and resumed in July 2002 only on an irregular basis'; and&#13;
third, expenditures associated with the emergency have increased over the past two years.&#13;
Central govemment revenue fell from a monthly average of US$83 million in 1999 to US$23&#13;
million by the First Quarter of 2002 and further declined to US$15.7 million in the Second&#13;
Quarter. Domestic tax revenue collection has shrunk to half the pre-Intifada monthly average&#13;
and, with the exception of transfers made since June 2002, clearance revenue, which had&#13;
'Three transfers in the amount of NIS 70 million each have been made in July, August and October for a total of&#13;
NIS 210 million since June. However, no formal agreement has been reached to resume transfers on a regular&#13;
basis and to reinstate the pre-existing transfer system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
averaged US$45 million per month prior to the crisis, has been withheld. Despite the severe&#13;
cutback in non-wage expenditures (Second Quarter 2002 non-wage spending was 63 percent&#13;
the level of the First Quarter, and 46 percent when compared with monthly non-wage&#13;
spending in 2001), the PA was running an average monthly deficit of approximately US$20&#13;
million, even after taking into account donor-provided budgetary support. This has been&#13;
managed through a combination of accumulating arrears to suppliers, borrowing from&#13;
domestic banks, and delaying the payment of salaries, pensions and welfare assistance. Since&#13;
July 2002, the Ministry of Finance has further reduced the PA austerity budget of US$90&#13;
million to US$70 million per month to reduce the further accumulation of arrears.&#13;
4.    By the end of June 2002, the PA had accumulated US$527 million in arrears, of which&#13;
US$295 million is due to suppliers and US$232 million in wages (including pensions). This&#13;
level of arrears has had a pernicious impact on the private sector, resulting in an acute&#13;
liquidity shortage, mounting non-performing loans in the banking system, and increasing&#13;
2&#13;
cases of insolvency . Vendors have felt compelled to continue providing credit, but many&#13;
have reached the point where they are no longer willing or able to do so. Settling these&#13;
arrears is a matter of top priority for the PA once Israel agrees to transfer the withheld&#13;
clearance revenue (estimated by the IMF to be US$681 million in gross terms owed as of end-&#13;
June 2002) and resumes regular transfers.&#13;
5.    Impact of the Crisis. Following nearly 18 months of protracted exchanges of&#13;
violence, the conflict intensified in the West Bank at the end of March 2002, causing severe&#13;
damages to physical and institutional infrastructure, including housing, public facilities, as&#13;
well as water, wastewater and electrical networks, particularly in the northern region of the&#13;
West Bank. This was coupled with a tightening of movement restrictions on the Palestinian&#13;
population.  A Damage Assessment was conducted with broad-based donor support&#13;
immediately following the intensified violence in March-April and developed an estimate of&#13;
damages to infrastructure and institutions of over US$330 million; this is in addition to an&#13;
estimate of damages of US$300 million, prepared by the Bank, that were incurred prior to&#13;
March, between September 2000 and December 2001. In addition, tightened closures have&#13;
increased travel time, which are now more than double the average prior to the Intifada when&#13;
closures and mobility restrictions were first imposed. Correspondingly, travel costs have also&#13;
dramatically increased during this period, as transport routes have been segmented within and&#13;
between areas.&#13;
6.    Vulnerability of the Palestinian People. The closures and movement restrictions&#13;
have had a profound impact on the lives and livelihoods of the Palestinian people. Monthly&#13;
household income decreased by 50 percent in the first 18 months of the Intifada, placing 66&#13;
percent of Palestinian households below the poverty line of US$2 per day. According to the&#13;
Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), as many as 84 percent of Gaza households&#13;
are now estimated to be below the poverty line. Nearly 55 percent of households lost more&#13;
than 50 percent of their income during the first half of this year, compared to 47 percent by&#13;
March 2001, signaling the deepening nature of the crisis. More than 55 percent of the&#13;
population has decreased the quantity of food consumed since the beginning of the Intifada.&#13;
This has invariably had its impact on the health status of vulnerable segments of the&#13;
2 See Fifteen Months -- Intifada, Closures and Economic Crisis: An Assessment, The World Bank, March 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
Palestinian population. A nutritional assessment carried out under the auspices of Johns&#13;
Hopkins University in July 2002 estimates the current rate of malnutrition among children&#13;
under the age of 5 to be about 20 percent, which is deemed an emergency in most parts of the&#13;
world. The study also found high levels of anemia among young children and women of&#13;
reproductive age. Food security is not only threatened by the population's lack of resources -&#13;
65 percent of households that cut back on food consumption reported lack of money as the&#13;
reason - but also by shortages of supplies in Palestinian shops. The Johns Hopkins study&#13;
found that movement restrictions have severely disrupted the availability of key high protein&#13;
foods like meat and dairy products, and in particular infant formula and powdered milk.&#13;
Palestinians have come to rely on informal social safety nets during economically depressed&#13;
periods, as most assistance is being provided by family, relatives or neighbors (60 percent of&#13;
food assistance and 11 percent of cash assistance). Many families have resorted to selling&#13;
gold and other household assets to survive the difficult times. But coping strategies such as&#13;
these, which have been relied on for the past two years, are unsustainable and quickly being.&#13;
exhausted.&#13;
Education services&#13;
7.    The Intifada has impacted the education sector in many ways. The quality of&#13;
education has suffered significantly. The top priority for education providers has been to&#13;
minimize disruptions to schooling and focus on keeping the schools running. Despite this,&#13;
and since the beginning of the school year in September 2002, 185 schools with 120,000&#13;
students (12 percent) are being closed, and an average of 40 percent of school days have&#13;
already been lost in Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarem and Hebron due to Israeli military curfews,&#13;
closures and home confinement. In addition, during last scholastic year 2001/2002, PCBS&#13;
reports that 60 percent of school children (542,000) were absent from school for at least one&#13;
day, with a median of ten days. During the period March 29 - May 1, 2002 the MOEHE&#13;
reports that about 500,000 students and 35,000 administrative and teaching staff were&#13;
confined to their homes.&#13;
8.    Physical damage to schools and institutes of higher education, restrictions on&#13;
movements and curfews have intensified since March 2002. Four Universities and 180&#13;
schools were partially or completely damaged with a total loss of US$7.8 million. In&#13;
addition, 274 students were killed, 2,698 injured and 190 arrested. Over 30 percent of&#13;
students are without textbooks and learning materials.&#13;
9.    This year, with the economy on the verge of collapse, many Palestinian parents are&#13;
unable to afford to send their children to school.' According to UNICEF, some 31-7,000&#13;
Palestinian school children are now in desperate need of assistance due to financial hardship.&#13;
10.   Institutions of higher education in WBG are facing serious financial difficulties. This&#13;
is mainly due to the socio-economic and political instability resulting from the conflict.&#13;
Human casualties stand at 119 students killed, more than 600 injured and 300 imprisoned:&#13;
Considerable physical damages were incurred during the latest Israeli incursion of April and&#13;
May 2002, and the severe economic recession has had a direct impact on the ability of&#13;
students to cover the cost of their higher education. Over the last twelve months an estimated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
US$6 million/month operating cost deficit has had to be absorbed by higher education&#13;
institutions (totaling US$72 million), added to it an estimated US$7.8 million of tuition loss.&#13;
The accumulated fiscal losses of the higher education sector amount to US$79.8 million.&#13;
11.   The World Bank currently supports the education sector in WBG through its ongoing&#13;
"Education Action Project (EAP) for US$7.00 million," which aims at improving the&#13;
management of the education system to deliver quality services, and at supporting the&#13;
Ministry in implementing the activities of the five-year plan. To cope with the current crisis,&#13;
the Bank has agreed to the Ministry's request to reallocate US$1.14 million within the project&#13;
to finance damage repairs resulting from the March/April 2002 incursions. In addition, a&#13;
Palestinian Higher Education Financing Strategy has been prepared by the Palestinian&#13;
Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHESR) with financial and&#13;
technical support provided by the Bank. The main purpose of the strategy is to create a more&#13;
effective, accessible, efficient, sustainable and accountable higher education system.&#13;
Health services&#13;
12.   Closures and curfews impose severe restrictions on access to health facilities for both&#13;
patients and medical personnel. All health programs including vaccinations, women's health,&#13;
child health, environmental health and preventive medicine are adversely affected, due to the&#13;
inability to deliver services and medicines to hospitals and health centers, and for&#13;
environmental, health insecticides and chlorine to water tanks - factors that may ultimately&#13;
result in the spread of epidemics.&#13;
13.   According to the OXFAM study "The Forgotten Villages in the West Bank," closures&#13;
deny village families access to basic services available in towns, cities, and villages. Health&#13;
and water are now for many households either too expensive or simply not available.&#13;
Increasingly, families are forced to use dangerous or inappropriate alternatives - such as&#13;
riding donkeys to the hospital, or unplanned home births - or to simply do without.&#13;
14.   Closures are creating a growing number of destitute families that are suffering from&#13;
malnutrition, chronic health problems, welfare dependency, and psychological stress. As the&#13;
main household managers, women are bearing the brunt of closure impact.&#13;
15.   The absence of regular monitoring, particularly in environmental health services, is&#13;
causing food and water born diseases, vector born diseases, and other environmental health&#13;
problems, including garbage, sewage vector, water, food, and animal (zoonotic) diseases&#13;
control. In July 2002, outbreaks of Shigellosis were reported in the Nablus area due to water&#13;
contamination arising from damaged sewage and water pipe infrastructure.&#13;
16.   The Palestinian Ministry of Health published recent data concerning the impacts of&#13;
closures and curfews on patients since September 19, 2000 to September 1, 2002.&#13;

17.   The Health Sector Bi-weekly Report, Number 2 (August 19, 2002), published by John&#13;
Hopkins University, Alquds University, MARAM and Care International/ ANERA, indicates&#13;
that access to services is more affected in the West Bank than Gaza, most likely due to the&#13;
greater restrictions of movement in the former. The emergency's impact on access to health&#13;
service facilities has significantly impacted health workers as well as patients. Staff in 46 of&#13;
the 94 clinics surveyed (49 percent of the total) reported having been unable to reach the&#13;
facility where they work at least once during the previous two weeks. The overwhelming&#13;
majority (45 out of 46 facilities) indicated that the primary factor in their inability to reach&#13;
work was curfews and closures.&#13;
18.   Forty of the 94 clinics surveyed since May 31, 2002, (44 percent) have had to suspend&#13;
or cancel one or more services for more than one day in the two weeks prior to the survey&#13;
interview. The proportion of clinics reporting such disruptions in services has remained&#13;
steady, within a range of less than five percent from round to round. Primary care, prenatal&#13;
care and emergency services in particular have been disrupted, followed by Pharmaceutical&#13;
services. All but three of the 40 facilities (92. percent), reporting having had to suspend&#13;
services, indicated that curfews/closures were a primary reason for suspension of services. At&#13;
the time of the survey interviews, 17 facilities out of the 40 (42 percent) had not yet resumed&#13;
those services.&#13;
19.   The World Health Organization (WHO) recently reported (Situation Report, Occupied&#13;
Palestinian Territories-July 2002) an alarming decline in the accessibility and affordability of&#13;
medical services:&#13;
*  UNRWA reports decreases in access to preventive services, including a 52 percent&#13;
decrease in women receiving post-natal care (of the 90 percent of women&#13;
attending pre-natal care pre-Intifada), and a 31 percent decrease in new&#13;
acceptances on their family planning scheme;&#13;
*  UNRWA reports from among its patients a 58 percent increase in the number of&#13;
still births (particularly in the Jenin and Hebron areas);&#13;
*  Hospitals report a decline in access to services. For example, St Luke's hospital in&#13;
Nablus reports a 49 percent decline in general practice patients, a 73 percent&#13;
decline in specialty services and a 53 percent decline in surgeries. The only&#13;
ophthalmic hospital in the West Bank is in Jerusalem;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
* The MOH also reports a 60 percent decline in implementation of school health&#13;
programs.&#13;
20.   Health services provided by the MOH have also deteriorated. The Ministry is unable&#13;
to finance the costs of operating and maintaining health facilities including communication,&#13;
fuel, water and electricity utilities, rent for health facilities, food, cleaning contracts, cleaning&#13;
materials, transportation, linen, uniforms, stationary and the essential repair or replacement of&#13;
ambulances damaged during the conflict. The MOH is facing shortages in essential drugs and&#13;
medical consumables, vaccines, laboratory and blood bank materials and it is unable to meet&#13;
the needs of patients requiring critical medical treatment abroad.&#13;
21.   Collective Donor Response to the Emergency.   A number of initiatives are&#13;
underway to assist the PA in responding to the emergency.  An elaborate donor aid&#13;
coordination structure was already in place and was revived in response to the crisis.&#13;
Regarding damages caused in March-April 2002, most donors began reallocating funds to&#13;
finance infrastructure and building repairs, as well as other emergency assistance to restore&#13;
institutional capacity and the provision of essential services both nationally and locally. This&#13;
exercise was informed by a coordinated donor-PA Physical and Institutional Damage&#13;
Assessment completed at the end of May in which several donors assumed responsibility for&#13;
gathering data in different segmented areas of the West Bank.  The findings of this&#13;
Assessment have helped guide the PA and donors in reallocating financing toward prioritized&#13;
emergency needs, while avoiding duplication of effort.&#13;
22.   A Political Roadmap to Peace. Although it is premature to consider any new&#13;
political initiative an indicator of a future outcome, there has been some movement on the&#13;
diplomatic front.  The Quartet, a newly-established apex-level political coordination&#13;
mechanism comprised of the US, the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations, met on&#13;
September 17 to agree on a plan which in three phases would lead to the establishment of a&#13;
Palestinian State. The first phase, which runs until mid-2003, includes Palestinian security&#13;
reform under US and regional auspices; an Israeli military withdrawal to positions held in&#13;
September 2000; and support of "free, fair and credible elections" early next year in the&#13;
Palestinian areas. The Second Phase, which is scheduled to begin in mid-2003, "should focus&#13;
on the option of creating a Palestinian State with provisional borders and based on a new&#13;
Constitution." The Final Phase, proposed to be implemented from 2004 to mid-2005, includes&#13;
permanent status talks and a final peace agreement between the two sides. In parallel a Task&#13;
Force on Palestinian Reform was established to which the Bank provides analytical support,&#13;
particularly in three areas of focus: (i) civil service reforms, (ii) local government reforms,&#13;
and (iii) financial accountability reforms.&#13;
23.   A Renewed Focus on Palestinian Reforms. The Palestinian Authority is in the midst&#13;
of a broad-based reform movement which was launched in June with a cabinet reshuffle and&#13;
the announcement of a Palestinian 100 Day Reform Program. Supporting this reform effort is&#13;
a newly formed Task Force on Palestinian Reform, which includes an active role for donors.&#13;
The Bank is deeply involved in two sector areas - Local Government Reform and Public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Administration/Civil Service Reform. The most notable reforms to date have been initiated at&#13;
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) by its newly appointed minister. Since June, MOF has:&#13;
i.    Adopted a more disciplined approach to the budget with a reduction of budgetary&#13;
expenditures to about US$70 million per month, down from an average&#13;
expenditure level of US$90 million, in part to avoid further accumulation of&#13;
arrears;&#13;
ii.   Consolidated all PA revenues, including those of the PA petroleum and tobacco&#13;
agencies, into a single Treasury account;&#13;
iii.  Installed controls to prevent issuance of checks without adequate cover;&#13;
iv.   Resumed transfers of civil servant contributions to the Govemment Pension Fund&#13;
in Gaza, which were previously accumulating as arrears; and&#13;
v.    Consolidated the payroll function in Gaza at the Ministry of Finance to exert&#13;
tighter controls over civil service recruitment.&#13;
24.   In addition to these reforms, MOF has also initiated central transfers due to local&#13;
govemments based on their share of revenue from traffic fines and vehicle licensing fees. The&#13;
first such transfer of NIS 15 million was made in September, representing a renewed attempt&#13;
to realign intergovemmental fiscal transfer practices with the local government law. This&#13;
represents a significant step forward in terms of intergovemmental fiscal relations, as&#13;
previously shared revenues were withheld by MOF and used to cover accumulating local&#13;
govemment arrears to foreign creditors. However, in making the September transfer, MOF&#13;
also informed LGUs that it was in the process of assessing cross arrears and that when this&#13;
assessment is completed it would begin to reschedule municipal debt to the PA.&#13;
II.   BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
25.   In the absence of a CAS, the Executive Directors approved on February 28, 2002 the&#13;
"Status Report to the Board on the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank and Strategic&#13;
Outlook." This document outlines the Bank's proposed strategy in WBG for 2002, which: (i)&#13;
aims to continue laying the institutional foundation for statehood through knowledge-based&#13;
analytical and policy work, and operations that encourage the development of sound&#13;
govemance institutions at the central and sector levels; and (ii) in the context of the current&#13;
crisis, continues providing analytical and programmatic leadership to the collective donor&#13;
effort to cope with the emergency, while initiating multi-donor operations to support the&#13;
delivery of essential social services and the maintenance/recovery of private sector activity.&#13;
The proposed project supports the second objective.&#13;
26.   As its contribution to the collective donor response, the Bank carried out a&#13;
comprehensive portfolio review in May-June 2002 and reallocated US$19.9 million from its&#13;
active portfolio, of which US$12.9 million was reallocated for emergency purposes, while a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
further US$7 million was cancelled from one project and returned to TFGWB for future&#13;
emergency or development assistance.  This assistance, comprising the Bank's most&#13;
immediate response, is now under implementation through existing project implementation&#13;
mechanisms. In addition, the Bank prepared an Emergency Services Support Project (US$20&#13;
million), which became effective in March 2002 to provide budgetary support to line&#13;
ministries to sustain essential health, education, social and local government services in&#13;
response to the widening PA revenue-expenditure gap. This operation has leveraged over&#13;
US$45 million in co-financing from seven donors and has proven to be an important&#13;
instrument in mobilizing donor assistance and in leveraging the Bank's contribution.&#13;
27.   Rationale for the Bank's Involvement. The Bank has considerable global and&#13;
WBG-specific experience in designing and implementing emergency operations in response&#13;
to natural disasters and emergencies arising in conflict-affected settings, and, in WBG in&#13;
particular, is often relied upon to lead such efforts. The first three operations implemented by&#13;
the TFGWB in WBG4 were all emergency in nature and benefited from simplicity in design,&#13;
while contributing toward the establishment of Palestinian implementation capacity in the&#13;
absence of such capacity at the outset. Moreover, the Bank has demonstrated an ability to&#13;
respond rapidly to emergency needs through its US$12 million contribution to the Emergency&#13;
Response Program5, launched in December 2000 - only two months after the start of the&#13;
Intifada -- in which the Bank and five other donors provided over US$37 million to create&#13;
temporary employment opportunities through small-scale infrastructure microprojects.&#13;
Furthermore, the Bank's continuing ability to mobilize resources and to contribute by&#13;
providing a framework for other donor assistance is illustrated by the Emergency Services&#13;
Support Project. In addition, the Bank's Country Office is staffed with highly skilled and&#13;
experienced national and international staff - both in West Bank and Gaza - which enables it&#13;
to more effectively administer and supervise emergency programs than many of the smaller&#13;
bilateral donors. This is the principal reason - in addition to the leveraging effect -- that many&#13;
bilateral donors have sought the Bank's assistance in administering their cofinancing.&#13;
28.   Lessons Learned from Previous Similar Operations. A major lesson leamed from&#13;
recent emergency operations supported by the Bank is that developing countries are becoming&#13;
increasingly aware of the need to put in place measures to prevent or reduce risks arising due&#13;
to crises. The past ten years have seen an increase in the number of Bank-supported&#13;
emergency recovery projects, and also a steep learning curve in the Bank's own&#13;
understanding of how to operationalize sustainable interventions. This institutional knowledge&#13;
was brought to bear on the proposed project through the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee, which&#13;
advised the task team. The task team also benefited from a Quality At Entry Review&#13;
conducted on the first ESSP project by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG), which also&#13;
yielded helpful lessons.&#13;
4 Emergency Rehabilitation Project I and II (November 1994 and May 1996 respectively) and the Education and&#13;
Health Rehabilitation Project (February 1998).&#13;
5 The Bank's contribution to the Emergency Response Program (ERSP) channeled a contribution of US$12&#13;
million through the Bank-administered Holst Fund and leveraged a further US$25 million in joint co-financing&#13;
through the PEACE Facility in support of emergency job creation through infrastructure micro-projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
29.   With respect to Bank experience in WBG, ESSP I demonstrated that decentralization&#13;
of service administration and delivery minimizes implementation delays. Line ministry upits&#13;
were responsible for implementation and the Ministry of Finance had a project management&#13;
unit with primarily a coordination and monitoring role. In addition, reliance on the staff qf&#13;
the Ministry of Local Government to administer the municipal services component of the&#13;
Project proved to be difficult due to capacity weaknesses. For this reason, the municipal&#13;
component of ESSP I has been spun off and restructured in a proposed separate operation,&#13;
allowing for focused attention on emergency assistance, sector dialogue, and reform at toe&#13;
local government level. A second lesson is that a project of this type must be kept simple ir}&#13;
terms of objective, components and implementation arrangements. Thus priority needs whiph&#13;
would require structural or policy reforms were not included. In particular for this reason ¢&#13;
was decided not to support the higher education sector in ESSP II. Simplified implementation&#13;
arrangements adapted to the particular situation in WBG include: ministries authorized to&#13;
establish specified sub-accounts and make 30 day advance transfers to these accounts to help&#13;
with prompt disbursement; and streamlined Bank procurement procedures to facilitate the&#13;
flow of funds. The US$20 million Trust Fund Credit for ESSP I became effective in MarVph&#13;
2002. By mid November it was 65 percent disbursed. It is expected to be fully disbursed by&#13;
March 2003, well ahead of the completion date of December 31, 2003. The associated,&#13;
cofinancing, which is mainly administered by the Bank, has disbursed at a comparable pace&#13;
since effectiveness of the various agreements over the course of the summer. The third lesson&#13;
was the value of good and timely planning for resource allocation, for procurement, and fcr&#13;
disbursement, and close cooperation between the Ministry of Finance and the participating&#13;
line ministries.&#13;
30.   A final key lesson learned from ESSP I and other related emergency operations is t4e&#13;
importance of maintaining close coordination with other donors.  There was close&#13;
collaboration at both the project preparation and project implementation phases. The Ministry&#13;
of Finance invites the participating donors to its quarterly Inter-Ministerial Review Meetings&#13;
for the project, and the monthly progress summary reports are also made available to donors,&#13;
This has provided transparency and a helpful feedback mechanism.&#13;

Project Description&#13;
37.   From the Program components described above, the project will finance only the&#13;
following components under the proposed Trust Fund Grant.&#13;
38.   Component 1: Non Salary Recurrent Expenditures. (a) Education Services: (i)&#13;
recurrent expenditures (US$5.85 million), and (ii) general examinations (US$2.70 million) for&#13;
a total amount of US$8.55 million; (b) Health Services: (i) essential drugs and medical&#13;
consumables (US$7.60 million), (ii) non-medical recurrent expenditures (US$3.60 million),&#13;
(iii) treatment in private/non governmental clinics (US$1.30 million), (iv) nutrition services&#13;
(US$0.45 million), and (v) hospital food contracts (US$0.50 million), for a total amount of&#13;
US$13.45 million; (c) Social Assistance Services: (i) recurrent expenditures (US$0.60&#13;
million), (ii) equipment for Shelters/Rehabilitation and Training Centers (US$0.35 million),&#13;
and (iii) minor rehabilitation works on Shelters/Rehabilitation and Training Centers (US$0.05&#13;
million), for a total amount of US$1.00 million; and (d) Support to Key Ministries (US$1.10&#13;
million). The total amount of financing for Component 1 is US$24 million.&#13;
39.   Component 2: Project Management and Monitoring. The Grant will finance&#13;
project management costs, equipment and technical assistance and training to the ministries in&#13;
charge of implementing the project for a total of US$0.3 million. The Grant will not finance&#13;
any studies. An amount of US$0.6 million is unallocated and will be allocated on the basis of&#13;
decisions on priorities by the MOF and line ministries with IDA's prior approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
IV.   INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
41.   The project will have the same implementation arrangements as those for ESSP I.&#13;
Overall management of ESSP I has been handled by the MOF through a PCU staffed with a&#13;
project coordinator, a financial officer, a procurement officer, an accountant, and a secretary.&#13;
The PCU will act as a liaison between the MOF and the participating line ministries. It will&#13;
report to the Head of the MOF Budget Departmentl who is IDA's first line of contact, and&#13;
who is responsible for ensuring timely submission of project monthly statements and&#13;
quarterly reports.&#13;
42.   The physical implementation of the project components will be the responsibility of&#13;
the line ministries concerned (MOH, MOEHE, MOSA and MOF). IDA will provide technical&#13;
support to the ministries to ensure proper monitoring and compliance with IDA's&#13;
procurement, financial management and reporting procedures.&#13;
43.   The Inter-Ministerial Committee, consisting' of representatives of the line ministries&#13;
and the MOF, will continue to exercise project oversight. The Committee will meet every&#13;
three months, inviting donors to participate, to review quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports&#13;
(FMR), which summarize the progress in the implementation of the project, and to discuss&#13;
any impeding factors.&#13;
44.   In its quarterly meetings, the Inter-Ministerial Committee will exchange with donors&#13;
information on the line ministries' budgets (revenues and expenditures) in an effort to&#13;
coordinate existing efforts in support of PA operating cost/service delivery programs.&#13;
Program Adjustment&#13;
45.   As with ESSP I, ESSP II will support emergency needs in an evolving situation and&#13;
will likely need to be adjusted from time to time iaccording to the beneficiaries' changing&#13;
needs, and in accordance with IDA and other donors' guidelines. Any reallocation within&#13;
and/or between programs for each beneficiary should be allowed, and would be considered in&#13;
consultation with IDA. Any variations in the sub-programs shall be validated through mutual&#13;
agreement between the MOF and the line ministries, with no objection from IDA.&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
46.   ESSP II will build on the financial management (FM) experience and lessons learnt&#13;
from ESSP I, and will follow the same FM arrangements, whereby each of the four&#13;
implementing ministries is responsible for the implementation of its own components,&#13;
managing its own separate Special Account (SA) under the supervision of MOF, and all&#13;
related financial transactions. The MOF will continue to host the PCU, which will maintain&#13;
its overall supervisory role.&#13;
47.   To ensure that funds are readily available for project implementation, each&#13;
implementing ministry will have separate SAs (four accounts in total). The four SAs will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
opened in US dollars at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA and will be operated by&#13;
respective participating ministries under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.&#13;
48.   Under ESSP I, FM   assessments were performned on the participating ministries&#13;
financial management systems, including the accounting systems, accounting policies and&#13;
procedures, budgeting systems, reporting, staffing, internal controls policies and procedures,&#13;
internal auditing and external auditing arrangements. These assessments were updated and&#13;
are included in the project files. They showed that the financial management systems in place&#13;
at the participating line ministries and the MOF are based on principles and procedures&#13;
defined by the Organic Budget Law, financial directives, and operational decrees applicable&#13;
to PA agencies. The control environments at participating ministries were found to be&#13;
adequate. However the financial systems lack the support of a project management module&#13;
and require enhancement to become capable of generating timely project reports. The&#13;
participating ministries, being aware of the system shortcomings, implemented a project&#13;
accounting system independent from the PA accounting system to allow for proper follow up&#13;
on project accounting transactions that generate necessary reports in a timely manner.&#13;
Accordingly, this will enable their accounting departments to generate periodical reports for&#13;
projects financed by IDA and other international donors.&#13;
49.   The PCU will prepare and submit to IDA monthly statements on the progress of the&#13;
project. In addition, each of the participating ministries will submit within 30 days of the end&#13;
of each quarter to the PCU quarterly FMR for review and comments. These FMRs will&#13;
include: (a) general progress report on project implementation; (b) sources and uses of all&#13;
funds; (c) expenditures per project component and activities; (d) project balance sheet; (e)&#13;
statement of reconciliation of the SAs; (f) procurement under the said thresholds; and (g)&#13;
report on budgeted cash requirements forecast for the following quarter, and analysis of&#13;
differences between planned and actual costs. A sample of FMRs is included in the PIP.&#13;
These reports will provide a basis for spot check audits by the external auditor to ascertain the&#13;
achievement of physical progress in the implementation of the Project. The PCU will send to&#13;
IDA the FMRs along with auditor comments and observations within 45 days after the quarter&#13;
end.&#13;
50.   Withdrawal of funds will follow traditional methods of disbursements by means of&#13;
reimbursements and replenishments to the SAs with SOEs and/or full documentation, special&#13;
commitments and direct payments accompanied by supporting documentation. The Project's&#13;
financial statements, including SOEs and the SAs, will be audited annually by an independent&#13;
auditor, acceptable to IDA, in accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards and&#13;
terms of reference acceptable to IDA. The audit report will be sent to IDA no later than four&#13;
(4) months following the closing of the fiscal year subject to the audit. Audit costs will be&#13;
eligible for IDA financing.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
51.   A procurement assessment of the MOH, MOEHE, MOSA and MOF has been carried&#13;
out by IDA, and can be found in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). All of these&#13;
institutions have experience working on Bank projects and are familiar with IDA guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
In particular, the procurement arrangements below draw from the experience of ESSP I, as&#13;
well as the co-financing agreements TF050492, TF050691, and TF050575, especially in&#13;
terms of financing food and medical treatment. Ministry staff will be further trained by IDA&#13;
field office staff, who will follow up on project implementation closely. The auditors on each&#13;
component will ensure that funds are properly used for the purpose they are intended. The&#13;
overall procurement risks have been assessed as average.&#13;
Procurement methods (Table A)&#13;
52.   All contracts financed by IDA will follow IDA guidelines as stipulated below.&#13;
53.   Procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for "Procurement under IBRD Loans and! IDA Credits," January 1995 (revised in&#13;
January and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999). Bank standard bidding&#13;
documents and domestic preference will apply in accordance with the provisions for&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB).&#13;
54.   Procurement for services will follow procedures prescribed in the Guidelines on&#13;
"Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," January 1997 (revised&#13;
September 1997, January 1999, and May 2002).&#13;
Table A summarizes the procurement arrangements under the project.&#13;
55.   Civil Works (US$0.05 million)The Trust Fund Grant (TFG) would finance minor&#13;
priority rehabilitation works to maintain MOSA's centers and shelters. All contracts would&#13;
be small in value. No International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement of works would&#13;
be feasible since the estimated contract value and tgeographic dispersion would not likely&#13;
attract international contractors. A typical menu of maintenance and rehabilitation works&#13;
could include painting, maintenance and repair of Ipublic buildings, and other small labor&#13;
intensive construction activities that require materials procured in the local market.&#13;
56.   Simple works and incidental materials and labor (US$0.05 million). Small works,&#13;
including incidental materials and tools, will be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic&#13;
contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed&#13;
description of the works, including basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic&#13;
form of agreement acceptable to the Administrator, and relevant drawings, where applicable.&#13;
The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the&#13;
required work, and who has the experience and resources to complete the contract&#13;
successfully.&#13;
57.   Goods (US$12.00 million). Goods procured for the project will include: essential&#13;
drugs, vaccines and medical consumables, hospital sheets and emergency room materials,&#13;
food and other nutritional supplements, office equipment and supplies, fuel, cleaning&#13;
materials, computer hardware and software, educational equipment and furniture, educational&#13;
video and audio production, instructional and technical materials, raw materials and tools for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
vocational and commercial education schools, first aid materials, fire extinguishers, etc. To&#13;
the extent possible, goods would be grouped together in lots of similar items and procured&#13;
under the following procedures:&#13;
58.   International Competitive Bidding (US$1.50 million).  Except as noted below,&#13;
contracts for goods will be procured through ICB, and the Bank's standard documents for&#13;
bidding and bid evaluation will apply.&#13;
59.   National Competitive Bidding (US$7.00 milion). Contracts for goods estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$500,000 equivalent and up to an aggregate amount of US$7.00 million may&#13;
be procured through NCB procedures, provided that the bidding documents are acceptable to&#13;
IDA. This method would also include the procurement of food. All NCB procurement of&#13;

Use of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
76.    Disbursements from the Grant will be fully documented for contracts for goods, with an&#13;
estimated value above US$500,000 equivalent, contracts for consulting firms with an&#13;
estimated value above US$100,000, and contracts for individual consultants with an estimated&#13;
value above US$50,000. Disbursements for all other expenditures including SDC will be&#13;
against SOEs, with supporting documentation retained in the respective implementing units&#13;
and made available for IDA review during supervision missions. SOEs will be subject to an&#13;
annual audit.    All other disbursements from    the Grant would be supported by full&#13;
documentation and signed contracts.&#13;
Special Account&#13;
77.    To facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures under the Grant, four SAs&#13;
will be established at commercial banks in WBG acceptable to IDA. The SAs will be&#13;
operated by the Budget and Finance units in the ministries (MOF, MOH, MOSA, and&#13;
MOEHE) under terms satisfactory to IDA. The MOF will co-sign all withdrawal applications&#13;
(WAs). Each SA will be maintained as a separate identifiable account to be used exclusively&#13;
for project expenditures financed by IDA. IDA will, upon request, make an authorized&#13;
allocation of no more than four months' average projected expenditures from the SA of each&#13;
component funded by IDA. The replenishment applications will be supported by the&#13;
necessary documentation in accordance with IDA guidelines, including a bank statement of&#13;
the SA and a reconciliation bank statement of the SA against IDA records. Applications to&#13;
replenish the SAs, supported by appropriate documentation, would be submitted regularly&#13;
(preferably bimonthly, but not less than monthly). The SAs and SOEs will be audited&#13;
annually as part of the annual financial audits by independent private auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The allocation of the SAs will be as follows: (a) MOEHE: US$1.7 million; (b) MOH:&#13;
$2.7 million; (c) MOSA: US$100,000; and (d) MOF: $130,000. Because of the possibility of&#13;
closures of West Bank towns or Gaza, SA 30-day Advance Procedure may be allowed. Under&#13;
this procedure, sub-accounts may be opened in a commercial bank in Ramallah (for the MOF,&#13;
MOH, and MOSA, main account will be in Gaza), and in Gaza (for the MOEHE, main&#13;
account will be in Ramallah). Funds may be transferred from the main accounts to the sub-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
accounts to meet eligible expenditures for a period of 30 days. The sub-accounts are&#13;
replenished only if expenditures are justified with their respective main account within one&#13;
month of receipt of funds.&#13;
Financial and Economic Justification&#13;
78.   The main justification for the project is that it will help preserve Palestinian Human&#13;
Capital by supporting the sustainability of social services to the Palestinian public at a time&#13;
when financing available to the PA's Central Social Service Delivery Ministries has been&#13;
reduced due to the severe budgetary crisis. This should help slow further decline in human&#13;
development indicators which are difficult to reverse and which could compromise the&#13;
country's development prospects for a long time after the crisis has passed. Therefore, while&#13;
the project itself is not sustainable, it will support the sustainability of national social delivery&#13;
systems, until such time that political conditions will permit resumption of bilateral relations&#13;
and fiscal improvements that would attend to them.&#13;

            West Bank and Gaza - Second Emergency
            Services Support Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Second Emergency
            Services Support Project are to mitigate the deterioration
            in education, health, and social welfare services, resulting
            from the economic crisis, and its consequent fiscal impact,
            by financing goods and services, necessary for service
            delivery. To this end, the project will: a) finance the
            non-salary recurrent expenditures of the core social
            service-delivery ministries of Health, Education and Higher
            Education, and Social Affairs, as well as other ministries
            whose operating non-salary budgets, the Ministry of Finance
            is unable to finance; and, b) finance the operating costs of
            the project implementation unit within the Ministry of
            Finance, and any other essential technical assistance needs
            identified by the participating ministries. It is expected
            funds will be fully disbursed by December 31st, 2004.
