The PNGTER results from the merger of two projects, the PNAGER and the PNER, originally designed in 1993 as separate&#13;
entities for implementation by the Ministry in charge of agriculture, and the Ministry in charge of planning and finance,&#13;
respectively. The two projects envisaged different planning and financing mechanisms and procedures to address complementary&#13;
needs of the same rural communities, and proposed the creation of project structures parallel to existing institutions and&#13;
ministerial organizations. The merger of the two projects was supported by the Ministries of Agriculture (MINAGRA) and&#13;
Planning and Industry (MDPDI) following a Bank mission in February 1995. The merger permits the Government of C6te&#13;
d'lvoire to avoid duplication of efforts, to integrate the proposed initiatives into the existing national institutional set-up, and to&#13;
utilize one comprehensive lending instrument to respond to the needs of rural communities in the areas of natural resources&#13;
management and small infrastructure development. As presented, the project is the outcome of the work of an Ivoirian inter-&#13;
ministerial task force headed by the Office of the Prime Minister.&#13;
This report is based on the findings of a pre-appraisal mission that visited C6te d'lvoire in April 1995, followed by an appraisal&#13;
mission in April 1996. The appraisal mission was led by Giuseppe Topa, Senior Environmental Specialist, Task Team Leader&#13;
(AFTA3). The team included Mrs. C. Morin, Senior Counsel (LEGAF), Mr. F. Rantrua, Geographic Information and Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation Specialist (AFTEI), Mr. M. Bekhechi, Environmental Legislation Specialist (LEGEN), Mr. C. Fisiy, Sociologist&#13;
(AFTEI), Mr. K. Christophersen, consultant, Economist, Mr. E. J. Yoboue, national, Expert in Rural Infrastructure Development,&#13;
Mr. A. Toure, Agronomist (AFMCI), Mrs. A Ayoung, Procurement Specialist (AFMCI), Mr. S. Fofana, Disbursement Specialist&#13;
(AFMCI), M. Leandre Gbeli, consultant, Financial Analyst, and Mr. N. Ehoud Bleoue, Agricultural Economist. The present&#13;
report was prepared by Giuseppe Topa. Jean Paul Chausse is the AFTA3 Technical Manager; Shigeo Katsu is the Country&#13;
Director for C6te d'lvoire, Chantal Dejou is Country Coordinator for C6te d'Ivoire; Cynthia Cook and Franz Kaps advised during&#13;
project preparation in their former AF4AE Division Chief and AF4 Operation Advisor capacities respectively. Lead Advisor for&#13;
the Operation was David Steeds (AGRPW); Brigitte Kerby-Dia, Task Assistant, provided support in the final phase of&#13;
preparation of project documentation, communications with the Government, and organization support for negotiations and&#13;
Board presentation.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE&#13;
RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY&#13;
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Over the past thirty years, development in C6te d'Ivoire has been accompanied by a progressive&#13;
degradation of natural resources. Rapid population growth of 3.4 percent annually in recent years has&#13;
increased pressure on resources. Land, water, forests, and wildlife have been compromised and&#13;
agricultural productivity has not kept pace with rapid population growth and immigration from&#13;
neighboring countries. Poor health, low education and insufficient nutrition have fostered poor use of&#13;
natural resources and inadequate maintenance of infrastructure, common property and open-access&#13;
assets. Insufficient investment capacity for infrastructure has hindered access to markets, which in turn&#13;
has limited capital availability and the potential for investments to preserve land productivity.&#13;
1.2   Today in West Africa, 18 different donors are supporting a total investment of about US$450&#13;
million in over 80 initiatives that are demonstrating that sustainable natural resources management and&#13;
rural development can best be undertaken through local-level, broad-based community development&#13;
plans and participatory partnerships with local groups to finance and manage local initiatives. The&#13;
foundation for the success and long-term sustainability of these efforts lies in appropriate land tenure,&#13;
decentralization and community empowerment policies.&#13;
1.3   The Rural Land Management and Community Infrastructure Development Project (PNGTER)&#13;
will help create the enabling environment for sustainable rural development by supporting the&#13;
implementation of suitable land tenure, decentralization and community empowerment policies. It will&#13;
then provide resources to complement local capacity to invest, presenting local people with a range of&#13;
alternatives while taking into consideration local experience, skills and social organizations.&#13;
2. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. THE ECONOMY&#13;
2.1    With a population of approximately 14 million and a 1995 GDP of US$9.8 billion, C6te d'Ivoire&#13;
is one of the principal countries in the CFA franc zone. The country is now emerging from a dozen years&#13;
of difficult internal adjustment. C6te d'Ivoire has been in recession since 1986 and faces a severe&#13;
external debt problem. High population growth rates and economic decline have led to a steady decrease&#13;
in living standards. Per capita GNP was well over US$1,000 in the early 1980s. By 1994, it had fallen&#13;
to an estimated US$5 10. In 1995, it was US$610.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
2.2    Cote d'lvoire's economic and social crisis began in the early 1980s, partly as an outgrowth of the&#13;
surge in public spending following the 1975-77 cocoa and coffee price booms. In 1994, despite several&#13;
attempts at stabilization and adjustment, the country still faced increasing economic and social problems.&#13;
Confronted with the deteriorating economic situation, the Government of Cote d'Ivoire along with its&#13;
partner countries in the CFA franc zone decided to realign the parity of the CFA franc to the equivalent&#13;
of 100 CFA franc to I French franc, effective January 12, 1994. Following the CFA devaluation, the&#13;
Government introduced a new stabilization and structural adjustment program for 1994-96 in a policy&#13;
framework paper discussed in March 1994 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World&#13;
Bank. The new program was supported by the IMF through an arrangement under the Enhanced&#13;
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and by the World Bank through several adjustment credits.&#13;
2.3   The first year of the post-devaluation adjustment program successfully reigned in inflation, and&#13;
stimulated growth and external flows. By the end of 1994, inflationary pressure subsided and the&#13;
increase in consumer prices was contained to 32.5 percent. Overall tax revenue exceeded programmed&#13;
levels, the wage bill and other current expenditures were under control, and public investment&#13;
expenditures exceeded the programmed level. The shift in demand towards local goods and a strong&#13;
positive response by non-traditional exports raised real GDP growth to 1.3 percent for the year despite&#13;
the impact of lower real wages on private consumption.&#13;
2.4    C6te d'Ivoire is heading for a period of political and economic stability. In October 1995, the&#13;
incumbent president was re-elected. In November 1995, parliamentary elections led to reappointment of&#13;
the Prime Minister. Municipal elections were held in March 1996, which involved all political parties.&#13;
The Government successfully exploited the opportunities created by the devaluation. The stabilization&#13;
program and structural reforms turned around a previously recession-plagued economy. Economic&#13;
growth accelerated from 1.7 percent in 1994 to 7 percent in 1995, the highest in the CFA franc zone and&#13;
among the highest in Africa.&#13;
2.5    Despite recent positive developments, financial concerns still dominate the economy and the&#13;
dialogue with financial partners. The country's external obligations still exceed the resources it can&#13;
currently mobilize internally or externally. During FY 1994-1996, IDA approved new credits totaling&#13;
US$557 million, of which US$195 million have already been disbursed, with 85 percent of IDA support&#13;
in the form of fast-disbursing operations. The present project supports the Government's effort to put&#13;
more resources behind economic development and poverty alleviation.&#13;
B. POVERTY&#13;
2.6    Despite recent improvements in Cote d'Ivoire's economic performance, 37 percent of the&#13;
population live in poverty. Poverty has worsened considerably since 1987, when the economy declined&#13;
following a sharp appreciation in the real exchange rate and a deterioration of the international terms of&#13;
trade. In 1985, 11 percent of the population in C6te d'lvoire was poor (with per capita incomes of less&#13;
than 144,800 CFA franc per year, about US$290). It is estimated that between 1989 and 1993 household&#13;
consumption diminished by 24 percent. The proportion of households living in poverty rose to 37&#13;
percent in 1995.&#13;
2.7    Deteriorating standards of living are reflected in the country's social indicators. C6te d'Ivoire&#13;
ranks 136th of 173 countries according to the UNDP Human Development Index -- 23 places lower than&#13;
its ranking on a GDP per capita basis -- indicating that the country lags badly in promoting social&#13;
development. Negative trends in service indicators, such as availability of safe drinking water, school&#13;
enrollment and use of medical services, have been prevalent for a decade, causing concern that outcome&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
indicators will be at risk in the future. Malnutrition, child mortality and illiteracy rates have risen to the&#13;
point that C6te d'lvoire's social indicators are often no better than those for lower income neighboring&#13;
countries.&#13;
2.8    Poverty is primarily rural in C6te d'Ivoire. The preliminary results of the ongoing poverty&#13;
assessment confirm that 75 percent of all poor and 69 percent of the extremely poor are concentrated in&#13;
rural areas. All rural areas are poor. The West Forest Region has the highest incidence of poverty with&#13;
47 percent of the population defined as poor. The East Forest Region has the highest absolute number of&#13;
poor people, and the Savannah Region has the highest incidence (16 percent) and largest absolute&#13;
number of extremely poor. As a group, over half of foodcrop farmers are poor and over one-third of&#13;
export crop farmers are poor. Urban poverty has also increased, from almost zero in 1985 to 25 percent&#13;
in 1995. Though urban jobs are scarce, limited rural income-earning opportunities have fueled urban&#13;
migration.&#13;
2.9    Access to basic education has been particularly limited for the poor. Primary school enrollment&#13;
is 34 percent in rural areas; it is 57 percent in urban centers. School enrollment is lowest in regions with&#13;
the highest concentration of poverty. Gender inequalities are particularly apparent in rural areas where&#13;
females have a lower school enrollment rate, a lower rate of achievement, less access to wage&#13;
employment and lower earnings.&#13;
2.10   After years of denial, the Government now recognizes the poverty problem, and is committed to&#13;
its alleviation. To bring about a gradual reduction in the absolute number of poor, special programs&#13;
focused on the poor, particularly women and children, are now being developed.  Agricultural&#13;
productivity must be raised and land tenure security enhanced if poverty is to be tackled. Environmental&#13;
investments must preserve and enhance the country's natural resource base, emphasizing the land, water&#13;
and forests on which the poor rely most. Infrastructure development must be accelerated, focusing on&#13;
the rehabilitation of facilities such as schools and dispensaries, and the introduction of approaches that&#13;
lower the cost of services for the poor.&#13;
2.11   The proposed Project concentrates its efforts in the rural areas where poverty is highest. Its&#13;
investment support will favor the participatory activities, production systems and types of small-scale&#13;
infrastructure the ongoing poverty assessment identified as most relevant to the poor and other&#13;
vulnerable groups.&#13;
C. THE RURAL SECTOR&#13;
2.12   Agro-ecological Regions. Cote d'Ivoire has a rich and varied natural resource base. It is located&#13;
in the humid/sub-humid zone with average annual rainfall ranging from 900 mm in the North to 2,500&#13;
mm in the South Coastal Zone. This natural resource endowment has the potential to allow for great&#13;
diversification of food and export crop production. It is estimated that about 53 percent of the country's&#13;
total land area of 320,000 km is suitable for rainfed agriculture and that about 6.5 million hectares (ha)&#13;
are currently cultivated, i.e., 38 percent of total cultivable area, if gazetted forests and national parks are&#13;
excluded. With a total rural population estimated at 7 million (1992), average population density in rural&#13;
areas is 22 persons/km2. The population is unevenly distributed; many areas in the Forest Region&#13;
already suffer from population pressure that exceeds land potential, given prevailing agricultural&#13;
technology. The country can broadly be divided into two primary agro-ecological regions with different&#13;
farming systems and demographic characteristics: the Forest Region and the Savannah Region. These&#13;
two regions are separated by a Transition Zone. With rainfall between 1,200 mm and 1,500 mm, the&#13;
Transition Zone has less clearly defined geographical boundaries than the other two regions. It enjoys&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
higher rainfall than the Savannah Region, but rainfall patterns are erratic and less predictable.&#13;
Agriculturally, this is the most challenging zone with the highest occurrence of crop loss due to drought&#13;
or flooding.&#13;
2.13   The Forest Region in the south has higher (1,200-1,800 mm) and more reliable annual rainfall&#13;
and soils of fairly good quality. In the past, the favorable agricultural base and low population density&#13;
induced a steady influx of farmers from the Savannah and neighboring Sahelian countries. About&#13;
530,000 farms out of the country's estimated 830,000 (64 percent of total) are located in the Forest&#13;
Region. The average farm household has 10 members. Farms average 10-13 ha of land, including forest&#13;
and fallow. Coffee and cocoa dominate the region's economy. They represent more than two-thirds of&#13;
cultivated areas. Other tree crops include oil palm, rubber and coconut. Annual food crops account for&#13;
about 25 percent of the region's total cultivated areas; maize, rice, yams, cassava and plantain&#13;
predominate (generally inter-planted with cocoa). Agriculture is based upon traditional, manual, land-&#13;
extensive, slash and burn practices, and yields are low for all crops, except for industrial rubber, oil palm,&#13;
pineapple and banana plantations. Extensive low-input low-output agricultural practices combined with&#13;
rapid population growth have led to large-scale deforestation. Increased population density has also&#13;
induced a gradual shortening of fallow periods, which are now inadequate to permit the restoration of&#13;
soil fertility. Until recently, land availability and high returns from coffee and cocoa enabled forest&#13;
farmers to steadily expand land holdings through sharecropping arrangements.  Localized land&#13;
constraints have led to migration rather than attempts to intensify agriculture. With diminished land&#13;
availability, however, continued land-extensive farming is no longer possible.&#13;
2.14   The Savannah Region in the North (180,000 km2) has more limited agricultural potential.&#13;
While rainfall (900 mm to 1,200 mm annually) is generally sufficient to permit rainfed agriculture, soils&#13;
with acceptable agricultural potential represent less than 50 percent of total area. Savannah farming is&#13;
dominated by rainfed food crops (maize, rice, yams, groundnuts) in pure or mixed stands. About 40&#13;
percent of the farms in the region (130,000 out of 300,000) produce cotton, the region's main cash crop.&#13;
Tree crops (mango, karite) and livestock are also significant sources of income. Household size is about&#13;
the same as in the Forest Region (10 persons), but the average farm size is smaller (3.5 ha), reflecting&#13;
higher labor requirements for the crops grown and the difficulty of attracting seasonal labor. Land&#13;
cannot be cultivated for more than two to three years in a row and yields are low. About 15 percent of&#13;
Savannah farmers and one-third of cotton growers use animal traction. Mechanization would entail&#13;
significant investments, with up-front costs to be amortized over a long period of time.&#13;
2.15   Agriculture. Agriculture has been and will continue to be the main driver of economic growth&#13;
in C6te d'Ivoire. Between 1960 and 1980 real value added in the agricultural sector increased by nearly&#13;
4 percent per annum. Cote d'lvoire remains the largest producer of cocoa in the world (an estimated 1.05&#13;
million tons in 1995/96), the second largest producer of robusta coffee (220,000 tons) and the third&#13;
largest African producer of cotton (260,000 tons). The country has the potential to be a large rubber&#13;
producer; it has the highest yields in the world. Agriculture provides 64 percent of employment, and&#13;
contributes about 33 percent of total GDP and 66 percent of total export revenue. Of the total cultivated&#13;
area (6.5 million ha), approximately 50 percent is devoted to export crops (cotton, coffee, cocoa, oil&#13;
palm, rubber, pineapple and banana) and 30 percent to food crops (maize, rice, plantains, cassava, yams).&#13;
The remaining 20 percent is composed of other crops such as fiber plants, citrus, and flowers.&#13;
2.16   Farmers constitute the vast majority of the rural population. Agriculture is the largest private&#13;
sector enterprise in the country and the one with the greatest growth potential at the lowest financial risk&#13;
and investment cost. Agricultural development presents the best opportunities to decrease poverty and&#13;
generate economic growth. It is estimated that the potential for annual sector growth is 5-6 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
through the year 2000. It is expected that agriculture will lead national economic recovery, particularly&#13;
through exports. The Bank-supported Government strategy is to use the agricultural sector as the&#13;
primary vehicle for poverty alleviation and sustainable economic development.&#13;
2.17   Forestry. For a long time (early 1960s - 1980s) forestry was a key sector in the Ivoirian&#13;
economy. Timber production rose almost fivefold between 1960 and 1980 before declining after 1984.&#13;
Exports, estimated at CFA franc 110 billion in 1984, had declined to CFA franc 80 billion by 1993.&#13;
Timber exports earnings are still substantial, and the Ivoirian timber industry remains an important&#13;
source of employment (about 11,000 jobs in 1993).&#13;
2.18   The rain forests of Cote d'Ivoire have been disappearing for the past 30 years at a rate of&#13;
approximately 300,000 ha per year. Only 2.5 million ha (8 percent of land area) of closed forest remains&#13;
in the Forest Region. In the Savannah Region only 2.5 million ha of degraded forests and other wooded&#13;
areas is left. Migrant encroachment and inappropriate logging have reduced the stock of high-quality&#13;
timber species.&#13;
2.19   The timber industry developed under a regulatory regime was designed to promote processing&#13;
activities. Exporters are required to operate local processing facilities. Eligibility to export is&#13;
proportional to producer processing capacity. As a result, though the bulk of timber exports (90 percent)&#13;
are processed products, there is an excess of inefficient local processing facilities (about 80 currently),&#13;
many established solely to obtain export allowances.&#13;
2.20   The 1994 devaluation substantially improved the competitive position of the Ivoirian wood&#13;
sector. It also created incentives to log second grade species in order to increase export allowances.&#13;
Commercial logging and deforestation have accelerated, jeopardizing the potential for the timber&#13;
industry to contribute to long-term environmental stability and economic development.&#13;
2.21   Since 1989, with support from the World Bank (Ln 3186-IVC), the Government has attempted to&#13;
halt agricultural encroachment in gazetted forests and develop sustainable management plans. As a&#13;
result, new encroachment has been significantly reduced, wood exploitation in gazetted rain forests is&#13;
extremely limited and efficiently controlled, and a dialogue with local people bordering gazetted forests&#13;
has been initiated.&#13;
2.22   Currently, most commercial logging is concentrated in un-gazetted rural forests, unprotected&#13;
forest areas on land owned by farmers under customary law. While in principle the trees belong to the&#13;
farmers, permits are issued to logging firms by the forestry authority, and only a nominal proportion of&#13;
the value of the standing timber goes to rural communities. Local people have no incentive to preserve&#13;
and use the forest sustainably. If non-gazetted forest areas are to survive, farmers must perceive the&#13;
benefits of sustainable forest management. With decentralization, new local governing bodies will give&#13;
more authority to communities to negotiate the terms of logging contracts and receive compensation&#13;
directly. It will be important to ensure that local communities perceive the forest as a sustainable source&#13;
of income and environmental services, and not a short-term  opportunity for cash.  By helping&#13;
communities focus on sustainable agricultural and agroforestry systems as part of broader set of natural&#13;
resource management options, the present Project will help reduce depletion of forests.&#13;
2.23   Environmental Degradation.   The agriculture-led economic development and liberal&#13;
immigration policies that prevailed in the 20 years following independence, accelerated migration from&#13;
Sahelian countries and transformed seasonal migration into permanent settlement.  Economic&#13;
development based upon extensive agriculture and increasing population has led to severe problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Closed forests, which covered about 13 million ha at the beginning of the 1960s, today cover only 2.5&#13;
million ha. The development of coffee/cocoa plantations has created an agricultural frontier that has&#13;
moved from east to west as migrants, in the tracks of timber extractors, have systematically penetrated&#13;
and cleared the rain forest (also encroaching upon gazetted forests). In most productive areas of Cote&#13;
d'Ivoire further expansion is hardly possible as agricultural land is becoming scarce.&#13;
2.24   Cote d'lvoire's biodiversity is a national and global asset. Since independence, the country has&#13;
established a network of parks and protected areas that provide a fairly complete picture of the various&#13;
existing ecosystems. Parks and reserves occupy 9 percent of the country's total land area; however, with&#13;
few exceptions, they are being encroached upon by fanners; their preservation and protection remain un-&#13;
assured.&#13;
2.25   Soil loss through erosion is estimated to be between 10 and 30 tons/ha/yr in the Savannah Region&#13;
and up to 200 tons/ha/yr in the Forest Region. The coastal zones, which include the last remnants of the&#13;
rain forests and biodiverse wetlands, suffer from the highest population pressure in the country; they are&#13;
particularly threatened, especially near Sassandra, Vridi and Abidjan.&#13;
2.26   A National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) was completed in 1995, with a follow-up&#13;
roundtable held in September 1996. The NEAP addresses key environmental concerns such as&#13;
deforestation, loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, coastal zone management and water pollution. The&#13;
present Project is featured as one of the primary instruments for implementation of the NEAP.&#13;
2.27   Land Tenure. Formal access to land is regulated by laws that were enacted during the colonial&#13;
period (decrees: 23 October 1904, 24 July 1906, 8 October 1925, 26 July 1932, 15 November 1935- the&#13;
primary decrees among 28 laws and regulations enacted after independence). In principle, all land&#13;
belongs to the State. Land can be given in the form of temporary or permanent concessions or as private&#13;
property to individuals that make a specific request. The Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources&#13;
(MINAGRA) issues concessions and land titles. The procedure for gaining formal access to land is too&#13;
complex and costly for most farmers. As a consequence, only 2 percent of total rural land has been&#13;
allocated under legal concessions and titles.&#13;
2.28   Modern law neither supports nor undermines land occupation in accordance with customary&#13;
rights. If traditional land occupants want to acquire legal rights to land, they need to make a formal&#13;
request and follow established procedures. In order to avoid conflicts, legal land titles are generally&#13;
issued for undeveloped lands for which customary claims are tenuous, not currently exercised or not&#13;
clearly grounded. Where lands are in use by traditional occupants, titles can only be issued only after&#13;
negotiations between the customary occupants and legal claimants. A payment is often made to the&#13;
customary occupant, but this is a practice with no legal foundation.&#13;
2.29   Currently, many different types of land occupation co-exist in rural C6te d'Ivoire, often within&#13;
the same village. They are customary and modern. They include lineage and family ownership, various&#13;
forms of long and short-term leases, and full-fledged legal ownership. Hybrids of all these forms are&#13;
most common. These arrangements are increasingly ill-suited to manage land rights acquisition in rural&#13;
areas. Unoccupied, undeveloped land is becoming very scarce. The informal process for compensating&#13;
customary occupants provides little guarantee to either the occupant or the legal claimant. Additionally,&#13;
the cumbersome, expensive titling procedures are inadequate to respond to the increasing demand for&#13;
land acquisition and titling in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
2.30   Since 1989, a pilot initiative financed by the World Bank and Caisse Franiaise de&#13;
Developpement (CFD), known as Plan Foncier Rural (PFR - Rural Land Plan), has addressed land&#13;
tenure issues, and demonstrated that there is a strong demand for the clarification of land rights in rural&#13;
C6te d'Ivoire. Through the PFR, village chiefs, lineage heads, farmers and other concerned parties have&#13;
participated in the identification of rights and mapping of village land and plot boundaries. Overall, the&#13;
pilot initiative has been extremely well received by villagers, and has not been meaningfully opposed or&#13;
criticized by any ethnic group, political party, NGO, association or other segment of civil society.&#13;
2.31   The PFR pilot operation covers eight zones that are broadly representative of the various land&#13;
use and land rights scenarios in C6te d'Ivoire. As of October 1996, the operation had completed&#13;
fieldwork on about 495,000 ha corresponding to 27,300 land plots in 360 villages. Land tenure rights&#13;
have been clarified for 270,000 people, including migrants, who compose between 5 and 70 percent of&#13;
the populations of the zones surveyed. The unit costs of the survey and land certification process have&#13;
decreased with experience and the introduction of technological improvements. Currently, land rights&#13;
clarification costs CFA franc 3,600 per hectare, which makes it possible to expand operations nationally.&#13;
2.32   The PFR has simultaneously charted land use and carried out household and village demographic&#13;
surveys. These surveys provide a wealth of information on land tenure, tenure claims by migrants,&#13;
conflicts between transhumant herders and farmers, access to unoccupied undeveloped lands, land&#13;
grabbing, and the rights of the Government to control unoccupied land. The maps that have been&#13;
produced are already being used to guide decision-making regarding the location of access roads,&#13;
transhumance corridors, small irrigation and land management works, and physical infrastructure. The&#13;
information and experience will be sufficient to determine the legal value of the PFR and lay the&#13;
foundation for a new land tenure law. Specific proposals were developed by a comprehensive legal&#13;
study completed in January 1996 as part of the preparation of the present Project.&#13;
2.33   A National Land Rights Reform Commission was established in 1993 to start working on a new&#13;
rural land tenure law. In August 1994, the Council of Ministers stated that the Government intends to&#13;
extend nationally the land tenure clarification operations launched through the PFR. The statement was&#13;
strongly endorsed by the donor community at the Paris Meeting of the Consultative Group in 1995.&#13;
Land rights and the PFR were studied as part of Bank sector work and a 1993 Bank Technical Paper&#13;
(AFR Technical Paper 238). The PFR was evaluated with French financing in 1994 and in 1996 with&#13;
World Bank financing. The present Project design is based upon the recommendations of past studies&#13;
and evaluations as well as supplementary analyses during project preparation.&#13;
2.34   Territorial Administration, Decentralization and Community Empowerment.  The&#13;
Country's administrative structure consists of 16 regions, 58 prefectures and 229 sub-prefectures. Before&#13;
1990, most technical ministries had their own regional and local organizations which did not necessarily&#13;
correspond to those of the territorial administration. In 1992, these were reviewed and reconciled;&#13;
Regional Development Commissions (CRDs) and Departmental Development Committees (DDCs)&#13;
under the authority of the Regional Prefects were created. The CRDs include representatives of the local&#13;
administration and technical ministries, elected representatives, village chiefs and members of&#13;
professional organizations. The CRDs are in charge of establishing, implementing and monitoring&#13;
regional development plans, including investment programs in the field of rural infrastructure and&#13;
agricultural development.&#13;
2.35   Since independence, the Government has been reaching out to local populations by&#13;
deconcentrating and decentralizing governance and the provision of services. Deconcentration has&#13;
involved the delegation of central territorial administration responsibilities to offices located closer to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
populations being served. In urban areas, decentralization has involved the delegation of responsibility&#13;
for matters of local interest to local entities called "communes" which have autonomous legal status.&#13;
Their representatives are elected by the local population.&#13;
2.36   Since the mid-1980s, 135 urban communes have been created, allowing 50 percent of the&#13;
country's population to select representatives and benefit from administrative and, increasingly, financial&#13;
autonomy.  Recently 61 urban communes (one per each sub-prefecture) were created.  The&#13;
decentralization experience has been positive. In 1993, 42 percent of communes total revenues were&#13;
generated from local taxes and fees collected directly. Another 42 percent was generated by centrally&#13;
collected taxes that were returned to communes.&#13;
2.37   Recently, the Government began to focus on expanding the decentralization process to rural&#13;
areas, and introducing a democratic system for governing local-level planning, decision-making and&#13;
administration. Law 95-892, which was approved on October 27, 1995 (General Organization of&#13;
Territorial Administration), established the legislative foundation for decentralization. Law 95-893,&#13;
approved on the same date, gave legal status to rural villages and groups of villages, and sanctioned their&#13;
right to be administered by locally elected governing bodies with administrative and financial autonomy.&#13;
The law also established the authority of the rural communes to formulate Local Development Plans&#13;
(LDPs) in consultation and collaboration with higher level governing bodies (rural districts, departments&#13;
and regions). The imminent creation of the first 110 rural communes was formally announced through a&#13;
communication from the Council of Ministers in September 1996. Despite the favorable legal&#13;
environment, extension of decentralization to rural areas is bound to be constrained initially by: financial&#13;
limitations, the absence of functional governing structures at the village level ready to assume&#13;
governance responsibilities, weak inter-village linkages, and the dearth of procedures and mechanisms&#13;
by which to facilitate village administration and inter-village cooperation and decision making.&#13;
2.38   Rural Districts (pays ruraux) will gradually be transformed into rural communes. Pays ruraux&#13;
are groupings of 6 to 9 villages that are similar in terms of accessibility and socio-economic profile, with&#13;
at least 5,000 - 6,000 inhabitants and 300 km2 of land. Pays ruraux were established by the Ministry in&#13;
charge of planning and finance as a planning unit in the 1970s. In preparation for transition to rural&#13;
communes, pays ruraux need to be strengthened by the creation of mechanisms and procedures for inter-&#13;
village decision making and administration. The present Project will help move pays ruraux in this&#13;
direction.&#13;
2.39   The FRAR Program. The Regional Rural Equipment Fund (Fonds Rigionaux d'Equipement&#13;
Rural- FRAR) was initiated in the early 1970s. It survived the economic crisis because of its appeal to&#13;
local populations and its success. Between 1972 and 1996, the FRAR channeled CFA franc 52 billion in&#13;
funds for over 10,000 microprojects for rural infrastructure, including social facilities (83 percent),&#13;
productive facilities (7 percent) and rural roads (10 percent). In the period 1993-1996 alone, the FRAR&#13;
supported 3,274 microprojects at a cost of CFA franc 24.4 billion, CFA franc 9.3 billion of which&#13;
consisted of village contributions.&#13;
2.40   The FRAR is one of the main instruments by which the Government and the donor community&#13;
have agreed to channel resources to promote local initiatives and foster decentralization and community&#13;
empowerment. The Fund complements financial resources gathered by local populations for priority&#13;
investments in agriculture, and rural and social infrastructure (village contributions vary from 30 to 60&#13;
percent, depending upon the type of investment and the income level of concerned villages).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.41   The Regional Planning and Development Directorate (DPDR) of the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Industry (MDPDI) is in charge of implementing and coordinating the FRAR regionally. The DPDR&#13;
consists of 10 regional chiefs and 37 field technicians who survey needs, collect village requests for&#13;
support, evaluate overall costs and government and beneficiary contributions, and supervise the award of&#13;
contracts, implementation, completion and payment for works.&#13;
2.42   Village requests are collected and discussed at annual sub-prefecture and regional meetings&#13;
organized by the FRAR involving representatives of technical ministries and concerned villages. This&#13;
approach ensures that proposed works are fully integrated into the programs of ministries, and that&#13;
adequate budget and staff are planned and allocated to operate newly created infrastructure (i.e., teachers&#13;
for new schools, visiting doctors and nurses for new dispensaries). Currently, Prefects and sub-Prefects&#13;
have administrative authority over the selection of initiatives proposed for financing and selecting&#13;
contractors to implement works. They also directly pay contractors once satisfactory implementation is&#13;
certified by FRAR technicians.&#13;
2.43   Although FRAR has concentrated on the creation of social infrastructure, a wide range of works&#13;
is eligible for support including land management, bottomlands development, small-scale irrigation, and&#13;
tree planting for protection and production. The technical standards, specifications and base costs for the&#13;
eligible types of infrastructure are listed in a catalog that was originally developed with UNDP support&#13;
and is updated annually. Preliminary identification of infrastructure needs is based upon a matrix that&#13;
defines the infrastructure required for given village (and pays rural) types. FRAR implementation&#13;
procedures, which are well known to the rural populations, are currently being updated. They will be&#13;
integrated into the Project Implementation Manual. The European Union (EU)-sponsored evaluation&#13;
concluded that the FRAR program is able to efficiently coordinate the implementation of sizable works&#13;
and ensure cost-effectiveness. FRAR projects such as school construction are about half as costly as&#13;
similar infrastructure built under other Government or donor-supported programs.&#13;
2.44   The general success of the FRAR should not hide some fundamental shortcomings that hamper&#13;
effectiveness. They include: (a) a rather mechanical approach to village needs, assessments and planning&#13;
of infrastructure which limits community participation and commitment to proper management and&#13;
maintenance; (b) a method for calculating village and government contributions that does not necessarily&#13;
reflect the capacity of communities to participate and the priority given to the various infrastructure&#13;
investment alternatives; (c) a relative disregard for works such as land management which require more&#13;
careful planning by and support from well-organized user groups; (d) insufficiently close links among&#13;
villages in a given pays rural, limiting the incentives for village support of works extending to other&#13;
areas of the pays rural; (e) insufficient village knowledge of and participation in the award, supervision&#13;
and payment of contracts; and (f) time gaps between the completion of infrastructure (i.e., hospitals) and&#13;
the provision of personnel and operating funds by concerned technical ministries and local funding&#13;
sources.&#13;
2.45   Following an EU-financed evaluation, DPDR is improving the FRAR's implementation and&#13;
funding mechanisms with EU, French and Bank support (through PNGTER preparation). The Project&#13;
will: (a) help the FRAR foster more community participation in the management and maintenance of&#13;
newly created assets; (b) strengthen inter-village organizations and links; and (c) enrich the range of&#13;
possible interventions in order to respond in a more comprehensive manner to infrastructure, land and&#13;
environmental management needs. In the future, communities will have a larger role in the selection of&#13;
initiatives to be financed, and in the implementation and management of new assets. The present Project&#13;
will assist the transition to greater community control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D.    THE BANK STRATEGY IN THE RURAL SECTOR&#13;
2.46   The current Bank strategy in the rural sector has three primary components: (a) the institution of&#13;
sound sectoral and macro-economic policies and structural reforms; (b) the improvement of production&#13;
systems, community organization and rural infrastructure; and (c) the implementation of sound&#13;
environmental management.&#13;
2.47   Sectoral Policies and Structural Reforms. These aim at restoring competitiveness and broad-&#13;
based, sustainable economic growth. The Bank is supporting reforms that remove rigidities in the&#13;
incentive framework, reduce the market-related functions of the public sector and support efforts to&#13;
divest and privatize public enterprises engaged in production and processing. In particular, the Bank is&#13;
helping the Government eliminate or privatize the transport price equalization system, further liberalize&#13;
the marketing of coffee and rice, and eliminate the commercial functions of Caisse de Stabilisation&#13;
(CAISTAB). Accompanying the shift in responsibility from parastatals to the private sector is support to&#13;
agriculture professional organizations for management of entire commodity sub-sectors. The Bank is&#13;
working with other donors to evaluate options for providing medium-term credit to farmers in a&#13;
financially and socially sound manner, while continuing to support the formation of small-scale rural&#13;
savings and loan cooperatives (CREPs).&#13;
2.48   Improved Production Systems, Community Organization and Rural Infrastructure. The&#13;
Bank assistance strategy concentrates on supporting land tenure clarification, community-based land use&#13;
and rural infrastructure development planning, rural investments, and production and marketing through&#13;
enhanced agricultural services. The Bank's strategy is to help the Government capitalize on the&#13;
reorganization of extension services to strengthen research-extension linkages and support the&#13;
development of a national agricultural research system that is responsive to the needs of farmers. The&#13;
Bank plans to reinforce the development of the livestock sector by supporting the integration of animal&#13;
health into the extension services. Support is also envisaged to streamline the functions of the&#13;
MINAGRA at the central level so it better sustains the decentralized structure in place at the field level.&#13;
2.49   Environmental Management and Conservation. Bank support focuses on assistance for&#13;
NEAP implementation, and national forest resources conservation and management. The NEAP is the&#13;
framework within which all programs with an environmental dimension will be screened and&#13;
implemented. Bank-assisted forestry programs will be continued, with an emphasis on conservation, and&#13;
a stronger focus on improving the incentive structure, logging and land conversion regulations, and&#13;
concession and fiscal policies. This will help curb deforestation and increase revenues to the&#13;
Government and rural populations. Core forestry protection, rehabilitation and management programs&#13;
will continue to be undertaken primarily in State-owned forests which have a higher biodiversity value&#13;
and, given their land tenure status, are more likely to offer an opportunity for long-term management and&#13;
preservation.&#13;
E.    LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS BANK EXPERIENCE&#13;
2.50  In developing the proposed Project approach, 12 past projects in C6te d'Ivoire (3 rubber projects,&#13;
2 road projects, 4 agriculture projects and several other rural development efforts), the findings of the&#13;
Africa Region FY94 Annual Review of Project Portfolio Performance (ARPP) and the Bank's sector&#13;
work on land tenure were analyzed. Past Bank experience indicates that natural resource management&#13;
projects should be developed as part of a long-term strategy for development. The Africa Region FY94&#13;
ARPP found that projects need to take into consideration cross sectoral issues including structural&#13;
constraints and policy distortions. For example, the Second Forestry Project (Ln 2496-IVC) would have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
benefited from a broader planning process that examined the risk of farmer encroachment. Government&#13;
policies are particularly important in creating or distorting the incentive environment needed to&#13;
encourage desired outcomes. To attain necessary policy reform, however, the ARPP, the Agricultural&#13;
Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln 3127-IVC) and the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Adjustment Loan&#13;
(Ln 3240-IVC) found that the institutional and political process for policy change needs to be outlined&#13;
from project inception. Additionally, the Fourth Rubber Project (Ln 2323-IVC) found that in order to&#13;
attain necessary policy reform, technical ministries as well as the range of other stakeholders need to be&#13;
involved in policy deliberations.&#13;
2.51   A participatory, demand-driven process of project design, and the selection of specific&#13;
interventions and activities is crucial for long-term success. Natural resource and agriculture projects&#13;
should incorporate activities that emphasize sustainable use and generate income and employment so that&#13;
they provide incentives for involving local people in the long term. The Second Grand-Bereby Rubber&#13;
Project (Ln 1575-IVC), Agricultural Extension Project (Ln 2765-IVC), and Northeast Savannah Rural&#13;
Development Project (Ln 1827-IVC), all suffered to some extent because they did not select activities&#13;
and priorities based upon local needs and preferences. Alternatively, the Center West Agricultural&#13;
Development Project (Ln 2167-IVC) and the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln&#13;
3240-IVC) both benefited in terms of sustainability by working with and listening to local people and&#13;
building local support for activities.&#13;
2.52   The Second Grand-Bereby Rubber Project (Ln 1575-IVC) and the Fourth Rubber Project (Ln&#13;
2323-IVC) would have benefited from more attention to land tenure status and land availability. The&#13;
success of the Center West Agricultural Development Project's (Ln 2167-IVC) pilot land tenure project&#13;
attests to the benefit of land tenure clarification in facilitating land administration and local investment in&#13;
project activities. The Bank's 1993 sector work on land tenure concluded that the approach followed in&#13;
Cote d'Ivoire is consistent with the thrust of Bank-financed initiatives favoring decentralization and&#13;
provision of agricultural services and rural infrastructure. The sources of land tenure insecurity should&#13;
be identified and instruments provided to address them. Additionally, the participatory approach to&#13;
acquiring land rights should gradually gain full legal significance. Land rights surveys and mapping&#13;
have limited impact unless they are complemented by institutional reform to facilitate land transfers and&#13;
enhance capacity to resolve disputes. Not all boundaries have equal importance: clarification and award&#13;
of legal status to the boundary of the village terroir as a whole should precede and will greatly reinforce,&#13;
the legal status of the terroir. If the community is to be protected against external private or state&#13;
interests this is indispensable. Land use data generated from boundary surveys should be used to&#13;
enhance planning at the local and national level. Land rights clarification alone is not sufficient to&#13;
generate development: its impact is greatly enhanced when clarification and mapping are accompanied&#13;
by extension support, investment and other opportunities to enhance farm incomes.&#13;
2.53   In order to optimize rural infrastructure such as rural roads, standard models with technical&#13;
specifications should be used to help plan and manage small road works while ensuring adherence to&#13;
minimum standards for new construction, routine and periodic maintenance, improvement and&#13;
rehabilitation. The exchange surrounding the 1992 "Review of Completed World Bank Operations"&#13;
indicated that existing guidelines such as those in the 1991 paper on "Rural Roads in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa" provide a good framework for operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
3.  THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
3.1    Fundamental demographic and ecological changes have characterized the last forty years in rural&#13;
Cote d'Ivoire. In 1955, the country had a population of 2.5 million indigenous citizens. Today, there are&#13;
approximately 14 million residents, 30 percent of whom are naturalized citizens from neighboring&#13;
countries. Over 80 percent of the closed forests, which covered about 13 million ha in the early 1 960s, have&#13;
been converted to low input/low yield agricultural land, plantations of perennial commercial crops and&#13;
unproductive wastelands. Rural areas house over 70 percent of the country's poor.&#13;
3.2    Past and ongoing efforts to improve agricultural practices meet infrastructure needs, and slow&#13;
deforestation has not been fully successful because critical incentives for sustainable land management,&#13;
human capacity to manage resources and infrastructure, and regimes, for control and regulation are&#13;
lacking. Land degradation is worsening, and past efforts to decentralize management have had only&#13;
limited impact. The strength of traditional village regimes of control is decreasing as immigration and&#13;
population growth increase. New instruments governing access to and management of land are needed.&#13;
3.3   Incentives for sustainable land management are inadequate. To maintain output, poor farmers&#13;
expand the area under cultivation rather than intensifying production. They do so because unregulated&#13;
access to land renders expansion less expensive than investments to improve land and purchases of&#13;
inputs such as fertilizer.&#13;
3.4    The action and investments required for sustainable management of natural resources and&#13;
community development are too site-specific, vast and diffuse to be centralized, organized, implemented,&#13;
finded and maintained by the Government.  Past centralized efforts to improve environmental&#13;
management and community development generally failed because they were sectorally focused, top-&#13;
down and production-oriented. Communities were inadequately involved in planning and did not&#13;
maintain investments. Decentralized management and investments in local infrastructure and land&#13;
management are critical. In principle, authority now rests with communities; however, they have been&#13;
unable to capitalize on the autonomy because they lack governing structures to manage participation in&#13;
planning and oversight of resources for investment.&#13;
3.5   In order to create a framework for sustainability, the Government, with the concurrence of the&#13;
donor community, has developed a broad strategy that cuts across sectors. This strategy intends to: (a)&#13;
create conditions that favor a structured approach to natural resources management using clarification of&#13;
land tenure as a primary tool; (b) build the capacity of and transfer authority to local organizations,&#13;
locally elected bodies, decentralized units of technical ministries, and local state authorities; and (c)&#13;
provide targeted support to organized communities to implement interventions for the development of&#13;
village land resources and infrastructure.&#13;
3.6    To be successful, the above elements need to be addressed in an integrated manner. Beginning&#13;
with the clarification of local land tenure, the proposed Project will help rural communities assume&#13;
responsibility for planning, financing and managing LDPs to improve the use of natural resources,&#13;
accelerate diversification, intensification and growth of agriculture, improve access to markets, and&#13;
upgrade basic living conditions. The organization and empowerment of rural communities will be key to&#13;
enhancing self-governance and ensuring the sustainability of programs. Past experience has clearly&#13;
indicated that while land tenure clarification is essential to facilitating improved land management and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
investments, it is not, in isolation, sufficient to generate investments and increase production, especially&#13;
in the short and medium term.&#13;
3.7    A base of policies, instruments and experience has been created in C6te d'Ivoire for clarifying&#13;
land tenure, decentralizing decision-making, financing village infrastructure and implementing&#13;
community-based natural resources management. The present Project provides an opportunity to use&#13;
these instruments and capitalize on this experience in an integrated fashion using existing institutions and&#13;
local entities as vehicles for implementation. As such, the Project is specifically endorsed by a policy&#13;
note which was jointly signed by the Ministers of Planning and Agriculture, that was approved by the&#13;
Council of Ministers, and disseminated to C6te d'Ivoire's donors and partners in development. The note,&#13;
which was issued as a condition for negotiations, states the role of the Project in support of inter-sectoral&#13;
policies and related institutional mechanisms (see paragraph 6.2.(a)).&#13;
B. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.8    The proposed Project supports land tenure clarification, improved environmental management,&#13;
rural development, decentralization and poverty alleviation -- all long-term endeavors for which&#13;
substantial Bank and donor community resources are needed. Each of these areas of activity was&#13;
highlighted in the assistance C6te d'Ivoire sought from the donor community during the 1995 Paris&#13;
Consultative Group Meeting. The Bank has a comparative advantage in providing support to the types of&#13;
activities supported by the Project. The World Bank pioneered support for land tenure operations in C6te&#13;
d'Ivoire in 1989 and supports comparable village land management programs throughout the region (i.e.&#13;
Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Benin).&#13;
3.9    The proposed Project fits well within the Government's strategy. It emphasizes those areas that&#13;
were specifically selected for Bank support in the June 28, 1994 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and&#13;
in the June 27, 1996 CAS Progress Report. The CAS update focused on five priority areas: (a)&#13;
maintaining macro-economic stability; (b) promoting private sector development; (c) increasing the&#13;
effectiveness of human resources development and poverty alleviation; (d) strengthening institutional&#13;
capacity; and (e) intensifying environmental work. The proposed Project is important for promoting&#13;
private sector development, improving infrastructure, and alleviating poverty. The Project is also central&#13;
in the implementation of the Cote d'Ivoire NEAP, which was developed with Bank support and adopted&#13;
by the Government in October 1995.&#13;
3.10   The present Project has been designed to create a framework for long-term development. As&#13;
such, it constitutes a critical element of the Bank's support to decentralization, poverty reduction, and&#13;
agriculture and forestry development. It supports decentralization and community-financed investments&#13;
in rural areas, while a parallel Project (Municipal Support Project, Cr. 2704 IVC), supports similar&#13;
activities in urban centers. The Project complements ongoing and future Bank-financed Forestry Sector&#13;
Projects because it will help organize communities, stabilize agriculture, improve infrastructure and&#13;
clarify land tenure in areas surrounding gazetted forests threatened with encroachment. The Project will&#13;
also increase the effectiveness and complement the Bank-supported Agricultural Services Project&#13;
(PNASA). In fact, it will make the results of land tenure and land use surveys immediately available to&#13;
extension agents, who will then be in a position to better focus their extension work.  Farmer&#13;
communities, organized with PNGTER support, will also be better able to capitalize on the technical&#13;
messages of extension agents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
C. PROJECT STRATEGY&#13;
3.11   Key to the Project strategy will be the implementation of activities by existing national&#13;
institutions and organizations. No new project structures will be created, and no adaptation of&#13;
institutional mandates will be required. Institution strengthening underlies all PNGTER components.&#13;
Project-supported activities will be integrated into the workplans of existing national institutions and&#13;
organizations. Existing financing channels will be employed and improved. In line with the&#13;
Government policy to withdraw from direct implementation of works, support to government institutions&#13;
will focus on enhancing capacity to oversee and evaluate the efforts of private and non-governmental&#13;
operators.&#13;
3.12   The Project will support government programs formally endorsed as priorities at the 1995 Paris&#13;
Consultative Group meeting. These are successfully tested, on-going, long-term government endeavors&#13;
such as land tenure clarification (Plan Foncier Rural), and the FRAR. The Project will also expand the&#13;
use of participatory planning and management to ensure that investments are made in areas where target&#13;
populations perceive a need and are willing to cofinance, maintain and manage assets.&#13;
3.13   In an effort targeted towards getting results in the field, a large proportion of funds is earmarked&#13;
for local investments. The selected financing mechanism will maximize the flow of funds directly to&#13;
primary stakeholders and intended beneficiaries, reducing unnecessary and costly financing procedures&#13;
and increasing transparency. In order to enhance poverty alleviation, community income levels will be&#13;
used as a criterion in selecting zones for intervention.&#13;
3.14   In order to increase sustainability, the Project will require a minimum of incremental recurrent&#13;
costs. Project implementation will not require deployment of additional permanent staff by the&#13;
Government. Most Bank financing will go towards the creation of new assets with minimum&#13;
maintenance costs and which communities will maintain (the land tenure registry and village&#13;
infrastructure).&#13;
3.15   Procedures for implementation will be outlined in an Implementation Manual that was prepared&#13;
as a condition of negotiation and will be adopted as a condition for project effectiveness (see paragraph&#13;
6.2(g)). The manual will facilitate implementation and ensure transparency. It will be improved and&#13;
updated over time as experience is accrued.&#13;
D. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.16   The project will help create the enabling conditions necessary for raising the standard of living of&#13;
Cote d'Ivoire's rural population by empowering communities, stimulating local investment and&#13;
facilitating sustainable management of natural resources and rural infrastructure. Its specific obiectives&#13;
will be to: (a) facilitate land tenure security on over 2 million hectares of rural land by introducing&#13;
legislation, instruments and procedures to help communities clarify land rights and increase land tenure&#13;
security; (b) strengthen local capacity to plan, make decisions, govern and manage affairs at the local&#13;
level; and (c) support small-scale investments for sustainable natural resources management, sustainable&#13;
agriculture, and infrastructure development that will be undertaken collaboratively by the Government of&#13;
C6te d'Ivoire and local communities.&#13;
3.17   The Project will be implemented in selected areas covering about 10 percent of the country's&#13;
land area and 18 percent of the rural population. It will be a vehicle for the implementation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Government policies and programs related to land tenure, decentralization, local self-governance, natural&#13;
resources management, and rural infrastructure development and maintenance.&#13;
3.18   The Project will enhance local management capacity in 1 10 pays ruraux. During the first year&#13;
of operation of the Project, 43 of these pays ruraux will acquire the status of rural communes.&#13;
Approximately, 660 villages, with an average population of 2,000 people per village, will be covered by&#13;
the Project. A total of 1.3 million people, 10 percent of C6te d'Ivoire's population, will benefit from the&#13;
Project.&#13;
E. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.19   Summary Description. The project consists of an interlocking set of components that are&#13;
organized to systematically facilitate sustainable community-based management of resources. The&#13;
project will help consolidate the incentive framework, and strengthen the human and institutional&#13;
capacity to manage local resources. This will be combined with assistance to develop locally appropriate&#13;
management plans. Finally, financing and long-term incentives will be made available to ensure that&#13;
management plans are implemented and reinforce the inclusive planning and management process that&#13;
has been established. The project will include four components: (a) clarification of land tenure; (b)&#13;
enhancement of local management capacity; (c) local investments; and (d) support for decentralization&#13;
and coordination of the project and the environmental mitigation plan.&#13;
(a)    Clarification of Land Tenure. Land surveying, mapping and land tenure clarification&#13;
will be undertaken to: certify land rights, facilitate conflict resolution, and help identify&#13;
land management and development options.&#13;
(b)    Enhancement of Local Management Capacity. Based upon the maps and information&#13;
obtained through the Clarification of Land Tenure component, communities will be&#13;
assisted to participatorily develop LDPs that outline what is needed to sustainably&#13;
manage agricultural, pasture and forest land as well as associated water resources, and to&#13;
develop and maintain village and inter-village infrastructure. Elected rural communes,&#13;
customary community organizations and interested groups will be strengthened to&#13;
facilitate self-governance and local management, and maintain newly created&#13;
infrastructure and income-earning assets. Organizations will be strengthened at the&#13;
village, pays rural, district and regional levels.&#13;
(c)    Local Investments. Financing will be provided to enhance community investment&#13;
capacity and implement LDPs. Prerequisites for financing will be: (i) community&#13;
financial contributions to activities; and (ii) the existence of community organizations&#13;
capable of helping manage and maintain investments.&#13;
(d)    Support for Decentralization, and  Coordination  of the Project and  the&#13;
Environmental Mitigation Plan. The Project will provide targeted material support&#13;
and training to the locally-elected governing bodies created in the process of&#13;
decentralization. The Project will also facilitate inter-institutional coordination, monitor&#13;
the implementation of policies and programs launched under the Project, and ensure that&#13;
the need for environmental mitigation measures is detected and addressed efficiently.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Detailed Description of Project Components&#13;
1.    Clarification of Land Tenure (US$30.8 million)&#13;
3.20   This Project component will be instrumental in securing land rights and developing private and&#13;
govemment capacity to survey land rights and provide land titles to interested right holders. The&#13;
component will expand the ongoing PFR, and help set-up long-term institutional arrangements for its&#13;
continuation and continuous update. The component will consist of two operations: (a) land and land&#13;
rights surveying, and (b) maintenance and management of land rights information. A detailed&#13;
description of the technical and legal aspects of this component is presented in Annex 10.&#13;
3.21   Land Rights Surveyine. The prime outcome will be the production of maps in paper and digital&#13;
formats, and of land tenure documents certifying local land tenure status. Current land use, and other&#13;
demographic and land-related information will be recorded to help guide community and government&#13;
decision-making about land management, the location of access roads, other physical infrastructure,&#13;
transhumance corridors, forest boundaries, and small irrigation works. The techniques that will be used&#13;
have been fully tested. Repeated evaluations have found them to be socially acceptable, technologically&#13;
adequate and reasonably priced.&#13;
3.22   At field level land tenure operations will involve: (a) awareness-raising campaigns targeted at&#13;
local people, local government officials, and elected representatives; (b) demographic surveys of the&#13;
people living on or using a given piece of land; (c) studies of local land rights customs and practices,&#13;
whether traditional or recently introduced; and (d) field surveys of land use and land rights, field by field,&#13;
in the presence of the land user, the land owner, neighbors and the village chief or other representative of&#13;
senior citizenry. Survey teams will be composed of an extension agent, a topographer and an&#13;
interviewer. Surveys will be completed only for lands where no disputes are pending. Following&#13;
completion of the land rights survey, information will be made public, locally and nationally, and any&#13;
claimant will be able to register disagreement. After three months without conflicting claims over a&#13;
given parcel, land tenure status will be considered certified.&#13;
3.23   The Bureau National d'Etudes Techniques et de Developpement (BNETD) will manage the&#13;
survey process at the request and on behalf of the Land Tenure Service of the MINAGRA. The land&#13;
survey and land rights documentation produced by the MINAGRA will meet the technical specifications&#13;
and formatting requirement of the Office of Cadaster of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF),&#13;
which is responsible for issuing land titles. This will facilitate and reduce the cost of titling if and when&#13;
this service is requested by farmers.&#13;
3.24   Project-supported land tenure clarification efforts will not change current perceptions of land&#13;
rights, i.e., they will not reinforce land use rights that are commonly regarded as tenuous (i.e., short-term&#13;
leases) or vice-versa. Experience indicates that for many farmers, recognition of land ownership by&#13;
neighbors, when supported by a government-sponsored initiative such as the PFR, is sufficient ownership&#13;
guarantee. For some farmers, mandatory or unsolicited issuance of land titles by a government agency&#13;
would generate fear of taxes and reduce interest in tenure clarification.&#13;
3.25   Survey teams will deposit maps in the relevant regional and central Land Tenure Service offices&#13;
of MINAGRA. Copies will also be left with the villages and sub-prefectoral offices of the State&#13;
administration. Land rights registers, indicating village, lineage and pilot boundaries, and recording&#13;
claims to land as well as current land uses will also be deposited as indicated above. In each village, land&#13;
tenure information will be maintained by a Village Land Tenure Committee. The updating of land tenure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
information by this Committee and by MINAGRA's local Land Tenure offices will have to be verified&#13;
and validated at the sub-prefectoral level by the Rural Land Tenure Commissions (RLTC) to be&#13;
established pursuant to inter-ministerial Arrete which was signed prior to Board presentation and to be&#13;
published in the Journal Officiel as a condition for effectiveness (see paragraphs 6.2.(c) and 6.3 (h)).&#13;
The RLTC will be chaired by a Sub-Prefect and will include: a representative of MINAGRA, a&#13;
representative of the national Cadaster, a magistrate, and representatives of local customary and elected&#13;
authorities. These committees will guarantee the veracity of land tenure documentation produced&#13;
through the Project and will be empowered to resolve conflicts at the request of local administrative and&#13;
traditional authorities.&#13;
3.26   Over 2 million hectares will be covered in five years. The Project will support the establishment,&#13;
training and equipment of 10 survey teams, one in each region. Each Land Tenure Regional Survey&#13;
Team (RST) will have 35 technicians, either contracted individually or in the form of micro-enterprises.&#13;
Support will also be provided at the central level to ensure centralized purchase of aerial photos, quality&#13;
control, coordination of field operations, and links with institutional partners Specific social and gender&#13;
analyses will be undertaken to ensure that the different sets of rights to land are captured by the project.&#13;
Special attention will be accorded to usufruct holders to guarantee, or at least not to hinder, their security&#13;
of tenure. Based on considerations of efficiency, the Project will seek incentives and mechanisms to&#13;
ensure an optimal and sustainable use of land by different stakeholders. To maximize the development&#13;
impact of the Project, the social assessment and analysis of land related conflicts that was carried out&#13;
during project preparation will be updated annually.&#13;
3.27   Maintenance and Manazement of Land Tenure Data. The long-term success of the land tenure&#13;
security instruments will depend upon the capacity created in supporting government institutions&#13;
(primarily the rural Land Tenure Services) and the commitment of villagers to update regularly the land&#13;
rights record. Though village boundaries are usually fixed, changes in land ownership and distribution&#13;
inside the confines of the village (among lineage groups and households) take place frequently and will&#13;
need to be recorded.&#13;
3.28   The Project will help create the necessary motivation and technical capacity at the institutional&#13;
and community levels to ensure that updating becomes routine for institutions and local communities. A&#13;
pro-active information policy and systematic efforts for training villagers and local authorities will help&#13;
ensure that updating of land rights records is demand-driven: specialized teams based in the Regional&#13;
Land Tenure Service offices will respond to requests from local people to update records. Regional Land&#13;
Tenure Service staff will be trained and equipped to respond to community requests and visit villages&#13;
semi-annually to monitor changes in land rights.&#13;
3.29   The Project will improve and equip land tenure service offices and train Land Tenure Service&#13;
personnel. ITF support will finance the rehabilitation and equipping of offices, training of personnel and&#13;
a portion of operating costs.&#13;
2.    Enhancement of Local Management Capacity (US$6.6 million)&#13;
3.30   Support will be provided to strengthen community capacity to identify and address problems,&#13;
work collaboratively with the State administration and the private sector, and fully engage in the process&#13;
of decentralization. More specifically, the Project will strengthen village capacity to plan, implement,&#13;
finance and manage initiatives and development plans at the pays rural level. Work under this&#13;
component will result in better organized communities capable of using locally available services and&#13;
funding to develop, co-finance and manage LDPs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
3.31   LDPs will summarize communities' priorities, and approach to development and management of&#13;
local assets and services. LDPs will specify the actions to be undertaken by community groups,&#13;
individual farmers and other land users as well as the external support needed. LDPs will indicate how&#13;
and where community resources will be mobilized and how resources available from the Project will be&#13;
used. The starting point for developing plans will be the information produced by the Project on land&#13;
tenure and village demography. LDPs will provide the basis for financing local investments through the&#13;
FRAR under the third component of the Project.&#13;
3.32   The "approche terroir", or its more recent evolution into "approche de developpement localr' (an&#13;
approach increasingly used for community-based natural resources management operations in West&#13;
Africa) will be adapted to local conditions and used to develop and implement LDPs. These approaches&#13;
are community-based, participatory and holistic in nature. They reconcile and address the needs and&#13;
demands of all users of a given village land. The main steps in the process include: (a) awareness raising&#13;
and trust-building; (b) needs assessment; (c) facilitation of community organization; (d) design of&#13;
community-based LDPs; (e) agreement between the community, govermment and other stakeholders; (f)&#13;
implementation plan; and (g) monitoring. The specific elements of an LDP were defined and discussed&#13;
with decision makers, technical staff and potential beneficiaries during Project preparation. LDP design&#13;
as well as plan specifications and format will be described and illustrated with examples in a Project&#13;
Implementation Manual that was discussed at negotiations and will be finalized with IDA's approval as a&#13;
condition for project effectiveness. (see paragraph 6.3(c)).&#13;
3.33   Participatory needs assessments and village development planning and management will be&#13;
facilitated by 16 multi-disciplinary support teams (MSTs) that will become operational during the first&#13;
year of the Project. These teams will generally be composed of a sociologist/trainer, an agroeconomist&#13;
and an accountant who will receive special training. It is expected that each team will work with about&#13;
40 villages (six to seven pays ruraux) over the five-year duration of the Project. MSTs will be organized&#13;
as micro-enterprises to work with the Project completing well-defined tasks over a fixed period of time.&#13;
They will be selected by the National Rural Development Agency (ANADER) and communities to help&#13;
develop and implement LDPs. Overall supervision and coordination of these micro-enterprises has been&#13;
assigned to ANADER by MINAGRA through an agreement that specifies the tasks to be undertaken and&#13;
their expected duration (see paragraph 6.2(b)). MSTs will facilitate interaction between communities&#13;
and government agencies, helping target and stimulate village requests for services. The modalities for&#13;
collaboration between MSTs and existing government agencies are reflected in a Framework Agreement&#13;
that was signed as a condition of negotiations (see paragraph 6.2(b)). Particularly close links will be&#13;
established between the MSTs and the FRAR regional officers to ensure that FRAR norms and&#13;
guidelines are taken into account in planning investments for financing through the FRAR. MST&#13;
assistance to villages will terminate once communities have been organized and trained, management&#13;
plans designed and approved, the primary investments completed, and the maintenance mechanisms put&#13;
in place. At the end of the Project, MSTs will become contractors to, or technical units of new "rural&#13;
communes", regions or departments.&#13;
3.    Local Investments (US$26.6 million)&#13;
3.34   This component will ensure project financing of LDP implementation. Financing will be&#13;
provided for packages of infrastructure development activities, natural resources management efforts and&#13;
productive interventions for which communities make a 3-4 year commitment to participate in&#13;
establishment, management, financing and maintenance. While the Project is designed to work with&#13;
whole communities and support packages of activities, during the initial stages of implementation&#13;
support may be given to specific interventions requested by smaller groups in order to build confidence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
and generate community-wide interest. In general the Project's direct beneficiaries will be: (a) one or&#13;
several villages which is (are) member(s) of a pays rural or a rural community; (b) a group fully&#13;
recognized by customary authorities and/or the rural community where the group resides, and is&#13;
registered with the sous-prefecture.&#13;
3.35   The LDPs prepared by communities will be finalized in collaboration with the FRAR regional&#13;
officer and introduced into the FRAR approval and financing process. Formal approval of an LDP will&#13;
be required at the village and pays rural levels. For investments involving ministerial responsibilities&#13;
such as schools and dispensaries, approvals will also be required at the district, department, region and&#13;
country levels. With the exception of the national level committee, the composition of approval&#13;
committees will always include representatives of the concerned villages, the Prefect, the Sub-prefect&#13;
and the relevant technical ministries. The approval process and procedures that will be used were not&#13;
specifically created for implementation of the proposed Project. While they may appear complex, they&#13;
are well-known by the local administration and local communities, are mastered by FRAR agents, and&#13;
have performed fairly well for the past 17 years. The approval process is outlined in Annex 7.&#13;
3.36   The Project will work with FRAR to enhance the community role in decision-making, limiting&#13;
the role of the Prefects and Sub-prefects to act as guarantors of fairness and legality in decision-making&#13;
and financial transactions. The approval and financing process will ensure that LDPs are consistent and&#13;
compatible with district, province and regional development plans and abide by state-of-the-art norms, as&#13;
well as national technical and environmental standards. The process will also permit concerned technical&#13;
ministries to approve or reject plans and arrange for the timely allocation of any necessary funds and&#13;
personnel.&#13;
3.37   The approval process will also allow proposed actions and investments to be screened for&#13;
compatibility with Project criteria identified in the Implementation Manual. These criteria will dictate&#13;
that: (a) supported activities benefit predetermined, eligible target groups; (b) only economically,&#13;
socially and environmentally sustainable productive activities receive support; (c) the beneficiary&#13;
community demonstrate its commitment to activities through a matching contribution; and (d) priority be&#13;
given to activities with relatively long-term economic and environmental returns that communities&#13;
usually could not afford to implement without external support. The criteria will ensure that the Project&#13;
does not finance: (a) recurrent expenditures; (b) activities that already receive funding from other&#13;
sources; (c) activities that may have a negative impact on the environment; and (d) activities that are too&#13;
complex or demand heavy mechanization.&#13;
3.38   The participatory nature of the Project makes it inappropriate to determine in advance the mix of&#13;
activities communities will adopt and the overall rate of adoption. No specific physical targets are&#13;
therefore set for specific Project activities. Community interest and the technical/economic viability of&#13;
various interventions were tested in different agro-ecological zones through village-level consultations&#13;
with beneficiary communities, agriculture extension and research institutions, the public works&#13;
department, the FRAR, and others providing funding or services in rural areas. The interventions that&#13;
appear most likely to attract community interest and absorb the bulk of Project resources are:&#13;
(a)   integrated agriculture production systems such as (i) improved agriculture practices&#13;
requiring adjustments in the spatial organization of traditional cropping patterns and&#13;
optimal crop rotations in the drier zones, (ii) improved management of fallow lands and&#13;
natural tree canopy to improve moisture conservation in the more humid zone; and (iii)&#13;
integrated agriculture and small animal husbandry in the dry and humid zones. For the&#13;
past seven years these systems have been tested with satisfactory results by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Agricultural Research Institute in Bouake. Full scale trials and demonstrations were&#13;
undertaken with villages that agreed to collaborate. Schemes increased production and&#13;
environmental sustainability, and were usually accepted and maintained by farmers after&#13;
termination of collaboration with the research institution;&#13;
(b)    improved agriculture production, forestry and agroforestry interventions such as&#13;
bottomland development, erosion control measures, small-scale irrigation, fishponds,&#13;
post-harvest loss reduction, fallow land management, and various family and village-&#13;
based agroforestry models;&#13;
(c)    small-scale rural infrastructure such as rehabilitation and construction of feeder and&#13;
access roads, rehabilitation and construction of classrooms, dispensaries, housing for&#13;
teachers and nurses, and solar photovoltaic equipment.&#13;
3.39   It is estimated that on average, the total Project and community resources required to finance&#13;
LDPs will be equivalent to US$24,000 per community, or approximately US$140,000 per pays rural&#13;
over a three-year period. Individual works or activities will normally cost less than US$40,000&#13;
equivalent.  It is estimated that overall community participation in funding Project-supported&#13;
interventions will be 35 percent of total cost provided in the form of cash, materials or labor. Different&#13;
percentages of community financing will be established based upon the results of a survey that is&#13;
currently underway to determine the capacity of villages in different zones of the country to participate&#13;
in financing, and their willingness to finance the various interventions supported by the Project. The&#13;
proposed level of external financial support corresponds to an average US$70 equivalent per household.&#13;
3.40   Support will be provided by making project funding available to the FRAR for investments in&#13;
selected Departments. Assistance will also be provided to strengthen the Directorate of FRAR and to&#13;
enable it to implement the most relevant recommendations of the 1994 program review that was carried&#13;
out with EU support. Assistance will focus primarily on FRAR offices in project areas -- rehabilitating&#13;
office space and equipment, introducing performance monitoring, streamlining procedures, and&#13;
increasing the field presence of FRAR using contracted staff.&#13;
4.     Support to Decentralization, Coordination and Mitigation of Environmental Impact&#13;
(US$7.5 million)&#13;
3.41    Support for Decentralization.  Assistance will be provided to the new local governing&#13;
institutions that will be created or further empowered by decentralization. These institutions include the&#13;
new rural communes. Office space will be improved and necessary equipment provided (manual&#13;
typewriters, calculators and other office equipment). The Ministry of the Interior and National&#13;
Integration (MIINT) will be provided with technical assistance to help define the functions of existing&#13;
and new entities under decentralization, and produce supporting office management guidelines and&#13;
printed forms that can be used immediately by the new local entities to start operations. The National&#13;
Cadaster will also be strengthened with new equipment to face an increased level in the number of&#13;
requests for rural land titling Finally, the proposed Project will finance information campaigns and&#13;
training to familiarize rural people with the rules and functions of the new democratically-elected bodies,&#13;
and to inform them of training programs available to elected representatives, personnel of the&#13;
decentralized administration of the State and civil servants in rural communes (treasurers, secretaries,&#13;
etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
3.42   Coordination. Coordination support will be provided to ensure overall project consistency,&#13;
smooth inter-institutional cooperation and adherence to inter-sectoral policies. Coordination will be&#13;
ensured by a team of three national specialists attached to the Prime Minister's Office. While&#13;
commanding a relatively small budget, this unit will be vested with authority, and have important&#13;
responsibilities including the review of annual programs for the project as a whole, and for training and&#13;
monitoring activities proposed and financed by other Project components. The coordinating unit will&#13;
also be in charge of studies, consultancies and other measures to be undertaken to monitor the&#13;
environmental impact of the Project.&#13;
F. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.43   The total cost of the Project, including refinancing of Project Preparation Facility (PPF), taxes&#13;
and contingencies, will be US$71.5 million. The proposed Interim Trust Fund (ITF) credit will finance&#13;
57 percent of total project costs or US$41 million, of which US$17.5 million will be foreign costs and&#13;
US$53.3 million local costs. The French Caisse Franqaise de Developpement (CFD) will contribute&#13;
US$11.8 million or 17 percent of total project costs. The local contribution will total US$18.7 million,&#13;
including US$11.7 million from the Government and US$7.0 million in the form of beneficiary&#13;
contributions.&#13;

3.44   The ITF credit will be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity. The financing plan and&#13;
the Project costs include valuation of cash, labor and materials to be provided by the rural communities&#13;
for execution of LDPs. The communities' contribution will correspond to 10 percent of total Project&#13;
costs. The Government's contribution will be US$11 million, of which US$10 million in taxes and&#13;
duties and US$1.0 million in cash to meet 30 percent of the incremental operating costs. In view of the&#13;
low level of the Government contribution to recurrent costs in absolute terms and in relation to the&#13;
overall budget of the concerned sectors, the proportion of ITF financing of recurrent costs, will remain&#13;
constant throughout the Project.&#13;
4.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
4.1    The Project will be integrated into existing institutional frameworks. Hence, its implementation&#13;
will not require the creation of Project-specific structures, nor changes in the current institutional setup.&#13;
The Project will be implemented through the following existing structures and programs: (a) the Land&#13;
Tenure Service of MINAGRA for the Clarification of Land Tenure component; (b) the National Agency&#13;
for Rural Development (ANADER) of MINAGRA for the Local Management Capacity component; and&#13;
(c) the FRAR of the MDPDI for the Local Investment Financing component. The Office of the Prime&#13;
Minister will facilitate inter-agency coordination as well as overall project support to decentralization.&#13;
As a condition of effectiveness, the Government should open Project Accounts for the Coordinating Unit&#13;
of the Office of the Prime Minister, Office for MINAGRA, and for FRAR, and make its first deposits of&#13;
CFA franc 25,000,000, CFA franc 50,000,000 and CFA franc 100,000,000, respectively, representing&#13;
the first payment of its financial contribution to the Project (see paragraph 6.3.(a)). A chart detailing&#13;
institutional responsibilities for the Project as well as the mechanisms and instruments for cooperation is&#13;
included in Annex 6.&#13;
4.2    A Coordinating Unit will be responsible for overall coordination concerning the Project,&#13;
reporting directly to the Office of the Prime Minister and under the supervision of the Steering&#13;
Committee. Said Unit will be headed by a Project Coordinator and will include a financial controller and&#13;
a training coordinator/monitoring and evaluation specialist. In view of the multidisciplinary scope of the&#13;
project, a Steering Committee has been established and will be maintained for the duration of the project&#13;
(see paragraph 6.1(d)). The Steering Committee will be chaired by the Prime Minister's representative.&#13;
Its membership shall include representatives from MINAGRA, MIINT, MEF, MDPDI, the Ministry&#13;
responsible for family and gender-related issues, the Directors General of BNETD and of ANADER or&#13;
their representatives. The representatives of the Societe de Developpement des Forets (SODEFOR), the&#13;
Forestry Department (DGEF) and other partners may also be invited as necessary to participate in the&#13;
Steering Committee in an advisory capacity. The Steering Committee will be in charge of reviewing&#13;
project progress and overall orientation, ensuring consistency and coordination of policies and project&#13;
activities with other Government and donor-assisted programs, examining the Project's annual&#13;
workplans, and proposing solutions to problems that go beyond the level of authority of the Project&#13;
Coordinator. The Committee will meet twice a year. The Project Coordinator will facilitate preparation&#13;
of the agenda and materials to be examined by the Committee. Representatives of other Ministries and&#13;
donors may be invited to the Steering Committee as necessary to ensure harmonization of approaches&#13;
and activities at the field level.&#13;
4.3    Land Tenure Component.  The Land Tenure Service of MINAGRA will have overall&#13;
responsibility for this component. It will be the principal user and manager of rural land tenure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
information.  It will establish a contractual agreement requesting BNETD  to coordinate the&#13;
implementation of land surveys and related field work on MINAGRA's behalf. Once survey and field&#13;
work are completed, BNETD will submit the results to regional and central Land Tenure Service offices&#13;
in the form of maps, registers and numerical information suitable for digitized updating and&#13;
reproduction. The contractual agreement will also entrust BNETD with responsibility for implementing&#13;
a training program for staff of the Land Tenure Service. The contractual agreement between MINAGRA&#13;
and BNETD will be specific and time bound. It will indicate respective roles, responsibilities and&#13;
modalities for cooperation, communication and reporting. The draft agreement was discussed at&#13;
negotiations and was signed as a condition for Board presentation (see paragraph 6.2(b)).&#13;
4.4    The procedures for collection of land tenure data and the format of presentation were&#13;
harmonized with the procedures and requirements of the Cadaster so that villages, interested individuals,&#13;
families and other groups (lignages) will be able to acquire land titles more quickly and at reasonable&#13;
cost. Collection and processing of data will be standardized by a joint instruction (circulaire) signed by&#13;
the Ministers of Finance, and Agriculture regarding the technical specifications to be followed for land&#13;
surveys, the presentation formats of the land tenure documents to be produced and the procedures to be&#13;
followed for publication of new titles. The joint instruction was distributed to concerned technical&#13;
services (Rural Land Tenure Service of MINAGRA and the Cadaster of the MEF) as a condition of&#13;
Board presentation (see paragraph 6.2. (d)).&#13;
4.5    Local Management Capacity Component. Implementation of this component will be the&#13;
overall responsibility of MINAGRA. Currently, the skills and institutional functions required to&#13;
facilitate implementation of this component are not part of the specific mandate and role of any existing&#13;
governmental or non-governmental institutions. Since the functions that need to be performed are&#13;
important but temporary in nature, they should not be permanently integrated into the mandate of&#13;
specific national institutions. The capacity to facilitate project implementation, and initiate a local&#13;
consultation and organizational process will initially be provided through the Project. Subsequently,&#13;
rural communes will sustain the process.&#13;
4.6    The Project will help with capacity building by recruiting and training young graduates who will&#13;
form three-person interdisciplinary teams employed by the Project on a contractual basis. Groups of two&#13;
or more teams will be encouraged and employed as private micro-enterprises. The teams will work&#13;
closely with national institutions and technical services, especially the FRAR, the national extension&#13;
service and decentralized state administration (prefects and sub-prefects). Teams will be recruited,&#13;
supervised and coordinated technically and administratively by ANADER, the semi-public agriculture&#13;
extension organization under the aegis of MINAGRA. This will ensure maximum synergy between&#13;
agriculture services, and land management planning activities. The nature and duration of the services to&#13;
be provided by the Project will be clearly specified in an agreement whereby MINAGRA will request&#13;
that ANADER undertake these functions. The terms of collaboration between teams, extension agents&#13;
and FRAR agents are summarized in a framework agreement which was drafted as a condition of&#13;
negotiation and signed as a condition of Board presentation (see paragraph 6.2(b)); its adequacy will be&#13;
assessed and reviewed during the annual review process.&#13;
4.7    Local Investments Component. Since the Project will use the FRAR as the primary financing&#13;
channel for local investments, this component will be the responsibility of the FRAR Service of the&#13;
DPDR of MDPDI. The Project will provide funds to permit the FRAR to finance, in accordance with its&#13;
procedures, and the amendments of these procedures as reflected in the Project Implementation Manual,&#13;
the investments proposed by the pays ruraux under their LDPs. The key steps in the FRAR approval and&#13;
financing process for investments are presented in Annex 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
4.8    The financing of village-level investments will take place using FRAR procedures, with&#13;
minimum adaptation and disruption of standard procedures and practices. The financial resources in&#13;
support of local-level investments at the Departmental Treasuries will be placed in a Special Account&#13;
controlled by the FRAR Service.  Departmental Treasuries will be reimbursed exclusively for&#13;
expenditures eligible under the Project.&#13;
4.9    As per current practice, the Departmental Treasuries will use the funds to pay for works and&#13;
services approved for implementation and provided by contractors. Payments will be made based upon&#13;
the terms of the contracts finalized between local communities and contractors with the assistance of the&#13;
responsible FRAR technician. Contracts will specify the modalities of payment and will be signed&#13;
between the contractor, the representative of the beneficiary community and the prefectoral or sub-&#13;
prefectoral authorities who will ensure the regularity of transactions. Invoices issued by the contractors&#13;
will be cleared by the representative of the communities, the FRAR technician, and the sub-prefectoral&#13;
and prefectoral authorities. The FRAR Special Account will be replenished monthly based upon&#13;
documentation of eligible expenditures accompanied by a summary statement from the Departmental&#13;
Treasury outlining activity since the last replenishment, with a certified balance and a reconciliation&#13;
statement.&#13;
4.10   Support to Decentralization, and Coordination of Project and Environmental Mitigation&#13;
Plan. The Project Coordinating Unit established within the Office of the Prime Minister will ensure&#13;
consistency of training programs and monitoring, and will be responsible for activities (such as overall&#13;
planning and reporting) that require consolidation and general oversight. The Coordinating Unit will&#13;
also manage Project support to decentralization and strengthening of Cadaster.  Locating the&#13;
coordination function within the Office of the Prime Minister will also provide the Project with the&#13;
political clout required to eliminate bottlenecks, and permit decision-making on issues beyond the&#13;
authority of the concerned ministries. Two people will administer a budget covering equipment,&#13;
consultancies and recurrent costs. The consulting and equipment budget will be used primarily to: (a)&#13;
review, consolidate and approve the annual training programs and monitoring contracts proposed by&#13;
MINAGRA and MDPDI; (b) channel the Project's training and material support to rural communes; (c)&#13;
strengthen the Prefects' and Sub-prefects' offices in the Project area, (d) strengthen the Cadaster through&#13;
the supply of equipment; (e) consolidate annual workplans, reports, and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
results; and (f) oversee the implementation of the project environmental mitigation plan. The Office of&#13;
the Prime Minister will also be in charge of ensuring the quality of key project staff (the coordinators for&#13;
project activities with the Coordinating Unit, MINAGRA, ANADER, BNETD, MDPDI the five financial&#13;
controllers, the long-term consultant to support MINAGRA, and a specialist for training coordination&#13;
and project monitoring). All these staff will have assumed their duties before project effectiveness (see&#13;
paragraphs 6.2.(e), 6.2 (f) and 6.3.(g))&#13;
B. COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, OPERATIONAL PLANS AND IMPLEMENTATION MANUALS&#13;
4.11   The Project will operate according to an Implementation Manual to be approved by IDA as a&#13;
condition of effectiveness (see paragraph 6.3 (c)). The manual will cover: (a) detailed institutional&#13;
arrangements (b) model agreements and contracts; (c) procurement procedures; (d) administrative&#13;
procedures; (e) financial management procedures; (f) micro-project selection criteria and detailed&#13;
financing mechanisms; and (g) village and target group selection criteria. The Implementation Manual&#13;
will be thoroughly reviewed at the Project mid-term review concentrating on the following areas among&#13;
others: (a) efficiency in the approval cycle for micro-projects; (b) client/beneficiary relations; (c) quality&#13;
control; (d) relative share of environmental protection, agriculture and infrastructure investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
financed under the Project. The coordinators for the three main project components, the financial&#13;
controllers and the consultants shall have at all times qualifications, experience, terms of reference and&#13;
conditions of employment (including criteria to measure performance) agreeable to IDA, acting as ITF&#13;
Administrator (see paragraph 6.1 (c)).&#13;
C. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING&#13;
4.12 Each component of the Project will benefit from its own internal monitoring as well as external&#13;
monitoring by the concerned Ministry. Allocations have been made in the budget accordingly. The&#13;
monitoring system will be based on two types of indicators.&#13;
4.13   The first indicators will measure progress along physical and financial parameters. These will be&#13;
traced by coding all project expenditures by project objective, component, type of activity, sub-activity,&#13;
status, location, and category of procurement, disbursement and source of funding. The resulting&#13;
information will be collated by the financial management system which will use a suitable, fully-tested,&#13;
commercial software for this purpose. The software will also permit the Project to record information on&#13;
not-yet disbursed and pending commitments. The system will be able to make available data on&#13;
expenditures, commitments and statistics of works by category of work, location, funding source,&#13;
reporting periods, etc. Achievements will be measured against annual budgets and workplans.&#13;
4.14   The second type of indicators will consist of a limited number of key parameters aimed at&#13;
providing a first indication of the Project's development impact. These indicators will include: (a)&#13;
number of land titles issued and area covered; (b) percentage of land under dispute out of the total land&#13;
covered under the Clarification of Land Tenure component; (c) value of land management investments&#13;
made on land with clarified land tenure status as opposed to comparable land with un-certified legal&#13;
status (on a sample basis); (d) number of LDPs approved, financed, and being implemented in Project&#13;
years III, IV and V; (e) proportion of village land placed under the sustainable management systems&#13;
promoted by the Project in selected villages (on a sample basis); (f) number of fully operational village&#13;
and inter-village interest groups undertaking Project-generated initiatives; and (g) the level of financing&#13;
provided in cash by local communities (see Annex VIII).&#13;
4.15   The information provided by indicators will be complemented by surveys and assessments on&#13;
specific themes such as the impact of selected Project-supported activities on women and other target&#13;
groups.  The primary features of the project's monitoring system  were outlined in the draft&#13;
Implementation Manual prior to negotiations. The above indicators were agreed to at negotiations and&#13;
mentioned in a supplemental letter to the Credit Agreement (see paragraph 6.1 (a)). The specific features&#13;
of the monitoring and evaluation system that will be used by the Project and the links between the&#13;
Project objectives and selected indicators are depicted in Annex 8.&#13;
4.16   Detailed component budgets will be integrated into annual workplans. These will be forwarded&#13;
to IDA (acting as ITF Administrator) for no-objection by October 31 of each year for the following year&#13;
(see paragraph 6.1 (f)). The submission of work programs and corresponding budgets for the first twelve&#13;
months after Credit effectiveness will be a condition for effectiveness (see paragraph 6.3(f)). Factual&#13;
information in the form of tables summarizing progress in activities and expenditures will be transmitted&#13;
to IDA (acting as ITF Administrator) every six months. Annual reports to the Government and IDA&#13;
(acting as ITF Administrator) covering all Project components will be submitted by October 31 of each&#13;
year (see paragraph 6.1(g)). These will cover: (a) current implementation status, i.e. progress of work,&#13;
inventory of equipment and goods acquired through the Project, disbursement and procurement issues,&#13;
progress on covenants, institutional issues, and (b) status of key project performance indicators. Each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
year, not later than December 31, the Borrower will convene a project implementation review meeting&#13;
with IDA (acting as ITF Administrator), other co-financiers and regional and local authorities, to review&#13;
the progress report, approve the workplans for the following year, and approve the recommendations of&#13;
the Steering Committee regarding project implementation (see paragraph 6.1 (f)).&#13;
4.17   A Mid-Term Review will be conducted during the third year of the Project. It will focus&#13;
primarily on the performance of institutional arrangements, the effectiveness of mechanisms used to&#13;
channel project funds to components and to intended target populations, the appropriateness of the list of&#13;
financed investments, and the impact of the Project (particularly land tenure operations) on women and&#13;
vulnerable groups. Assurances have been obtained during that: (a) the Borrower and IDA (acting as ITF&#13;
Administrator) shall conduct, not later than June 30, 2000, a mid-term Project Implementation Review;&#13;
(b) no later than six weeks prior to this review, the Borrower shall furnish a report that includes an&#13;
evaluation of progress achieved in implementation by the Borrower in general, an analysis of key&#13;
problems that have emerged during implementation, and a draft action program to be carried out through&#13;
the completion of the Project; and (c) the Borrower shall carry out promptly the recommendations of the&#13;
review negotiations (see paragraph 6.1 (i)).&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.18   The implementing agencies (the Land Tenure Service of M1NAGRA, the FRAR of the MDPDI&#13;
and the Office of the Prime Minister), as strengthened by the Project, have adequate capacity to carry out&#13;
the Project. Table 4.1 summarizes Project costs by disbursement category and proposed procurement&#13;
method. A country procurement review for C6te d'Ivoire was completed in May 1996. Recommended&#13;
improvement actions were integrated into the design of the present project. Current procurement laws,&#13;
methods and procedures adopted by the Government with respect to local competitive bidding are in line&#13;
with IDA requirements. The proposed project will be financed through the Interim Trust Fund (ITF) for&#13;
FY97 in accordance with OD 11.00. Procurement under the FY97 will follow World Bank's guidelines&#13;
(see paragraph 6.1(b)) on procurement of goods, works and services-- Guidelines: Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995 revised January and August 1, 1996 (Procurement&#13;
Guidelines) and Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency, January 1997, (Consultant Guidelines)-- in all respects, except that procurement will&#13;
be limited to ITF contributing donors. Preference for domestically manufactured goods will apply in&#13;
accordance with World Bank Guidelines.&#13;
4.19   Civil Works. The ITF Credit will finance US$18.5 million, or 68 percent of the US$27.1&#13;
million estimated total cost for civil works to be awarded to communities in the form of grants for&#13;
community micro-projects. It will cover labor, material and equipment. The civil works program&#13;
consists of building construction and rehabilitation, and a wide variety of small works carried out by&#13;
communities to maintain and/or improve natural resource productivity and rural infrastructure (such as&#13;
erosion control, water-harvesting, tree planting, bush fire and windbreaks, wells, storage facilities,&#13;
rehabilitation and construction of feeder roads, and rural buildings). The cost of these generally will not&#13;
exceed US$40,000 equivalent each including the estimated value of the contribution provided by the&#13;
community.&#13;
4.20   The civil works program will not be appropriate for ICB procedures, due to the small size and&#13;
geographic spread of the works, and high associated transportation costs. No contract is expected to cost&#13;
more than US$120,000. Contracts above US$40,000 and less than US$120,000, for an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$4.3 million (US$3.8 million ITF-financed), will be procured through NCB procedures. The rest&#13;
of the civil works program includes small works estimated to cost less than US$40,000 each, for an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
aggregate amount of US$22.0 million (US$14.7 million ITF-financed); these are unlikely to attract&#13;
competition from foreign or local modem-sector firrns. It will be up to the communities, with technical&#13;
support of FRAR technicians, to contract services from local artisans and undertake procurement of&#13;
locally available materials, following commercial practices - contracts being awarded on the basis of&#13;
Community Participation procedures acceptable to IDA (acting as ITF Administrator) with short lists of&#13;
suppliers and qualified micro-enterprises, and price quotations obtained from at least three&#13;
contractors/suppliers. FRAR technicians will be responsible for verifying and certifying that these&#13;
procedures are followed.&#13;

4.21    Goods. Goods financed by the Project (US$17.4 million, of which the ITF Credit will finance&#13;
US$6.7 million) include furniture, equipment, office supplies and vehicles. Goods that can be grouped&#13;
into packages of at least US$150,000 each will be procured through ICB. It is estimated that goods for an&#13;
aggregate value of US$7.0 million of which US$4.1 million ITF-financed, will be procured through ICB.&#13;
Bank standard bidding documents will be used. A preferential margin of 15 percent or the applicable&#13;
customs duty, whichever is less, over the c.i.f. prices of competing goods will be given to domestic&#13;
manufactured goods in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for all ICB procurement. All bids will be&#13;
submitted on a c.i.f. basis for imported goods and on an ex-factory basis for locally manufactured goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Goods that cannot be grouped into packages of at least US$150,000 each will be procured through NCB,&#13;
provided that the aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed US$3.0 million (US$1.3&#13;
million ITF-financed). Small quantities of office supplies, consumable materials and spare parts that are&#13;
available off-the-shelf and cannot be grouped into bid packages of at least US$50,000 may be procured&#13;
through national shopping, based on price quotations of at least three reliable suppliers, provided that the&#13;
aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed US$3.2 million (US$1.3 million ITF-fmanced).&#13;
4.22   Consultant Services and Training. The ITF Credit will finance US$6.1 million out of a total&#13;
US$1 1.1 million for consultant services and training.  Consultant services will be contracted in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelinesfor the Use of Consultants (January 1997). These include short&#13;
and medium-term technical assistance, contracted research and studies, and technical and financial&#13;
auditing. Quality and cost-based methods will be generally applied for the procurement of consultants&#13;
and services.&#13;
4.23   Service Contracts. Of the total cost of Service Contracts, US$10.8 million, ITF will finance&#13;
US$6.5 million. Service Contracts will include: (a) contractual services for land surveying, and services&#13;
provided to assist communities in the preparation of LDPs (up to a limit of US$6.8 million, of which&#13;
US$5.4 million will be ITF financed); (b) aerial surveys, which will be procured through ICB (US$1.4&#13;
million of which US$1.1 ITF-financed). For contracts estimated to cost US$200,000 and less, the nature&#13;
of services will generally be such that service contracts will be appropriate, and NCB procedures will be&#13;
used. If the scope of work under some of the contracts tends to be more of technical services instead of&#13;
physical surveys, contracts will be awarded following Consultant guidelines.&#13;
4.24   Review by IDA (acting as ITF Administrator). ITF-financed contracts for goods and works,&#13;
and service contracts above a threshold value of US$100,000 equivalent will be subject to IDA's prior&#13;
review procedures. The first three contracts awarded by each of the main implementing agencies&#13;
(MINAGRA, MDPDI, and the Office of the Prime Minister) under US$100,000 will be subject to prior&#13;
review. Selective post-review of awarded contracts below the threshold levels will apply to about one in&#13;
three contracts. Prior IDA review will apply to works under community micro-projects exceeding&#13;
US$40,000 equivalent. It will also apply to consultant contracts estimated to cost more than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent for firms and US$50,000 for individuals, however, prior IDA review will apply below these&#13;
thresholds for terms of reference, single-source hiring of firms, assignments of a critical nature as&#13;
deternined by IDA (acting as ITF Administrator), and amendments of contracts raising the contract&#13;
value to US$100,000 or more for firms and US$50,000 or more for individuals. Contracts for goods and&#13;
services procured under parallel financing arrangements will be awarded in accordance with the co-&#13;
financiers' procurement regulations. Sanples of standard bidding documents will be part of the&#13;
Implementation Manual. Finalization of bidding documents satisfactory to IDA for critical ICB and&#13;
NCB procurement of goods and works as well as for the procurement of key consultancy services related&#13;
to the implementation of the Project for the first year will be a condition of effectiveness (see paragraph&#13;
6.3(b)). The World Bank's 1996 standard bid evaluation reports will be used by the Project for all prior&#13;
review procurement documents.&#13;
4.25   Assurances were obtained during negotiations that procurement of the goods, works and&#13;
consultants' services required for the Project and financed out of the proceeds of the Credit will take&#13;
place in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA (see paragraph 6.1(b)). The Project Coordinator&#13;
will submit to IDA (acting as ITF Administrator) semi-annual progress reports updated information on:&#13;
(a) contract awards; (b) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total Project; (c) revised&#13;
schedule of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for&#13;
individual contracts; and (d) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
The Mid-term Review will produce a thorough review of procurement and contract management&#13;
practices.&#13;
4.26   Procurement status of ongoing projects and proposed arrangements. Procurement for IDA-&#13;
financed agricultural projects in C6te d'Ivoire has encountered some serious difficulties in the past which&#13;
lead to the drafting of a portfolio improvement action plan, and a review of the disbursement schedule of&#13;
various operations. Current disbursement lag for IDA operational projects is around 11 percent. Local&#13;
firms have participated in ICB and there are an increasing number of small and medium size contractors&#13;
that meet the appropriate standards of responsibility.&#13;
4.27   As agreed at and reflected in the minutes of negotiations, the Government will ensure that: (a)&#13;
procurement processing will not exceed the time periods in the table presented in Annex 2; and (b)&#13;
custom formalities for importing goods under the Project will be processed within one month of the date&#13;
of application.&#13;
E. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.28   The current disbursement profile for agricultural projects in C6te d'Ivoire is 71/2 years. The&#13;
present Project is expected to disburse more rapidly, in six years, for the following reasons: a) the Project&#13;
will use a well-established delivery system and disbursement channel (FRAR) for its major category of&#13;
expenditures; and b) agreements were reached with the Borrower at negotiations defining maximum&#13;
delays in procurement action. The Project's schedule of disbursement, as well as the table showing&#13;
maximum admissible delays for procurement action are presented in Annex 2. Disbursement of the&#13;
credit will be made according to the categories shown in Table 4.2.&#13;

*Cross reference to definitions contained in Table 4.1&#13;
4.29    Special accounts. The Project's Coordinating Unit, the Land Tenure Service of MINAGRA and&#13;
the FRAR will be responsible for preparing and presenting withdrawal applications for expenses accrued&#13;
to support components under their responsibility and all categories of expenditures. To facilitate project&#13;
implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, three SAs will be opened in CFA at&#13;
CAA, one for the Coordinating Unit at the Prime Minister's Office, one for MINAGRA and the other for&#13;
MDPDI-FRAR. The authorized allocations will amount to CFA franc 200 million for the Coordinating&#13;
Unit, CFA franc 500 million for MINAGRA and CFA franc 1 billion for FRAR, and will cover about&#13;
four months of eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness, amounts of CFA 100 million for the&#13;
Coordinating Unit, CFA 250 million for MINAGRA and 500 million for FRAR representing 50% of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
authorized allocations will be deposited in the respective Special Accounts. The remaining balance will&#13;
be made available when the total amount withdrawn from the credit account and/or Special&#13;
Commitments issued amount to the equivalent of 20 million dollars. Replenishments will be submitted&#13;
monthly.&#13;
4.30   The SAs will be used for all payments below FCFA franc 40 million for the Coordinating Unit,&#13;
CFA 100 million for MINAGRA and CFA 200 million for FRAR. All replenishment should be fully&#13;
documented except for: (a) contracts for goods and works costing less than US$100,000 equivalent, (b)&#13;
contracts of less than US$100,000 for consulting services - firmns, (c) US$50,000 for consulting services -&#13;
individuals, and (d) US$40,000 for community micro-projects, which will be claimed on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained for review&#13;
by periodic Bank supervision missions and external auditors.&#13;
F. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
4.31   The Land Tenure Service of MINAGRA, the FRAR Directorate of MDPDI and the PNGTER&#13;
Coordination Unit in the Office of the Prime Minister will maintain separate accounts and records for all&#13;
project activities, including SOEs, SAs and Project Accounts. The SAs held by the Land Tenure Service&#13;
of M1NAGRA, the FRAR Service of MDPDI and the PNGTER Coordination Unit in the Office of the&#13;
Prime Minister will be audited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to IDA (acting as&#13;
ITF Administrator). Audit reports will include a separate opinion on the use of SOEs, the SAs and the&#13;
Project Accounts. The three agencies will provide interim and annual financial statements to reflect the&#13;
financial performance and position of the Project. The auditores report will include a statement on the&#13;
adequacy of the accounting system and internal controls, the reliability of SOEs as a basis for Credit&#13;
disbursements, and compliance with financial covenants.&#13;
4.32   Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (a) the records and accounts (SAs, Project&#13;
Accounts) will be audited for each fiscal year in accordance with appropriate auditing principles&#13;
consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to IDA (acting as ITF Administrator); (b) the&#13;
Borrower will furnish to the Association (acting as ITF Administrator) as soon as available, but in any&#13;
case not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, a certified copy of the report of such an&#13;
audit by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Association (acting as ITF Administrator)&#13;
shall have reasonably requested; and (c) the Borrower will furnish to the Association (acting as ITF&#13;
Administrator) such other information as the Association (acting as ITF Administrator) shall from time&#13;
to time reasonably request. A condition of effectiveness will be the appointment of an auditing firm&#13;
acceptable to IDA (acting as ITF Administrator) to audit Project Accounts, based upon a one-year&#13;
contract to be extended on a yearly basis, and the establishment of a fully operational computerized&#13;
financial management system (see paragraph 6.3(d) and 6.3(e)).&#13;
G. PARTICIPATORY APPROACH AND DONOR COORDINATION&#13;
4.33   The proposed Project was prepared by an inter-ministerial task force headed by the Office of the&#13;
Prime Minister based upon two project proposals originally prepared by the MINAGRA and the MDPDI&#13;
with FAO assistance. Project preparation involved working with over 35,000 households associated with&#13;
the demographic studies and land tenure surveys undertaken with PPF financing. The preparation team&#13;
worked particularly closely with a smaller number of households in the identification of local priorities&#13;
and local development potential. The last phase of project design involved rapid rural appraisals in four&#13;
villages and three residential seminars with Government officials, farmers and entrepreneurs. A final&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
retreat was held during which the representatives from the Prime Minister's Office and the Offices of&#13;
concerned Ministries discussed detailed project design and implementation issues with representatives of&#13;
the rural communities most involved in design. Finally, a social assessment was carried out in May 1996.&#13;
The results of the assessment and the summary of the measures that were integrated into the project to&#13;
ensure that it will have a positive social impact, especially on women and vulnerable groups, are&#13;
presented in the form of a matrix in Annex 11.&#13;
4.34   Two major donors, the EU and France, were closely associated with the project preparation&#13;
process and participated in all key project preparation events and meetings with Govemment. A major&#13;
thrust of these donors' programs in Cote d'Ivoire supports the objectives of the present Project. The EU&#13;
is supporting the decentralization process and improvement of the FRAR. Since 1993, the EU has&#13;
channeled US$15.3 million equivalent through the FRAR. The level of future EU support is not yet&#13;
known, but it is likely that EU assistance will emphasize technical assistance for process improvement.&#13;
France recently started financing two initiatives parallel to the proposed PNGTER. Both French-&#13;
supported projects benefited from the preparation process set-up for the PNGTER. The first project&#13;
(PNAGER, US$6.6 million equivalent over five years) is located in the northem districts. The second&#13;
project (Equipment and Rural Management, US$20 million equivalent over four years) is less area-&#13;
specific and provides funding for FRAR-channeled investments. Overall, there is broad consensus as to&#13;
the objectives, relevance and key implementation options preferred by the EU, France and the Bank.&#13;
H. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
4.35   While no displacement or involuntary resettlement will take place under the Project, and its impact&#13;
on the environment is expected to be highly positive, the variety of environmental and social issues touched&#13;
upon by the project, suggested that a category A environmental assessment be carried out. The study was&#13;
completed in two stages. The first was completed in early 1995, the second in October 1996. The&#13;
project's environmental assessment involved an analysis of all environmentally sensitive project&#13;
components, and was complemented by an overall project social assessment and by specific case studies&#13;
on the Project's land tenure operations. The studies conclusions, which were endorsed by the&#13;
Government and found acceptable by the Bank, were that the Project will have a highly positive overall&#13;
impact and no meaningful adverse effects. The design of PNGTER minimizes potentially negative&#13;
environmental impacts by fostering consideration of social, environmental, economic and cultural factors&#13;
in community planning and decision making. The holistic planning process fostered and facilitated by&#13;
PNGTER is intended to result in the creation of sustainable development plans; most of the potentially&#13;
negative project-related impacts should be avoided or mitigated in the community planning process.&#13;
Excerpts from the Executive Summary of the Environmental Impact Assessment are presented in Annex&#13;
12. Since the environmental impact assessment of the project was developed as part of project&#13;
preparation, most of its results were integrated into the project design and budget. Annex 12 presents a&#13;
summary table of the mitigation plan that will be financed by the Project to prevent potential adverse&#13;
effects.&#13;

5.   PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1    The Project will substantially improve the quality of life of about 1,300,000 people living in I 10&#13;
pays ruraux including 660 villages selected on the basis of willingness to collaborate with the Project&#13;
and relative level of poverty and local infrastructure. The primary benefits of the Project will be:&#13;
(a)   improved land tenure security in the Project area, and established mechanisms, enabled&#13;
institutions and legal instruments to enhance nationally rural land tenure security;&#13;
(b)    empowered local communities and local community governing bodies, improved local&#13;
management capabilities, increased local responsibility and ownership of local&#13;
initiatives, more effective use of community owned resources and of matching resources&#13;
available through state- and donor-sponsored programs;&#13;
(c)   investments in agricultural production and natural resources management that increase&#13;
outputs and introduce more sustainable production systems; established sustainable land-&#13;
use systems that balance production against resource consumption and promote the&#13;
restoration of ecological stability;&#13;
(d)   investments in rural infrastructure that improve basic living conditions, including access&#13;
to schools, health services, and clean water;&#13;
(e)    opportunities for private sector developments through over 1500 small contracts to be&#13;
awarded on a competitive basis to local enterprises, and through the creation of new&#13;
consulting firms and a market for their services in support of the decentralization&#13;
process.&#13;
5.2   In the longer-term, through the Clarification of Land Tenure component, the Project will reduce&#13;
conflicts over land, and create a basis for loan guarantees and a land-based taxation system that will&#13;
facilitate and make more equitable revenue collection in rural areas.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
5.3    The design of the Project was based on the examination of altematives to ensure that the&#13;
approach and technologies used, and the institutional arrangements selected, would be the most likely to&#13;
succeed at the lowest cost and level of extemal support. Four different solutions were considered.&#13;
Socio-economic factors, technologies, institutional issues and management options were analyzed and&#13;
compared. Resulting scenarios were outlined and debated at national seminars organized under the aegis&#13;
of the Prime Minister's Office and of the Ministries concerned. The selected scenario was chosen as the&#13;
most suitable for reducing the administrative burden and ensuring that the greatest possible share of&#13;
Project resources will flow efficiently to intended beneficiaries, achieving tangible, durable results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
5.4    The economic analysis of the Project started with the financial analyses of 3 integrated farming&#13;
systems, 13 individual techniques in the field of natural resources management and 8 small rural&#13;
infrastructure interventions. These assessments analyzed the costs and benefits of several technical&#13;
options in three representative agroecological zones of the country. The most financially, technically and&#13;
socially feasible designs were retained for future consideration.&#13;
5.5    Several different packages of possible interventions were considered for given socio-economic&#13;
and agro-climatic situations. The size and values of the packages were kept within the estimated&#13;
capacity of villages to contribute cash and labor in order to qualify for partnership with the Project.&#13;
Aggregations of sample activities and packages likely to be chosen by communities were considered on a&#13;
agro-ecological-zone, community and pays-rural basis. Assumptions about the rate of adoption, and the&#13;
enabling conditions created by the Project and other Government services (availability of extension,&#13;
access to markets, availability of inputs) were incorporated into the analysis.&#13;
5.6    The data made available through the economic analysis helped shape project design, and define&#13;
project implementation principles and monitoring parameters that will help ensure the Project's&#13;
economic viability. One of the key lessons of the economic analysis was that the project should only&#13;
support packages of interventions that incorporate a variety of different investments, at least 45 percent&#13;
of which are agriculture-related productive activities and 10 percent of which are non-agricultural&#13;
productive activities.&#13;
5.7    The potential profitability to farmers of investments was assessed in terms of the return on labor&#13;
and the financial return on investments (both individual investments and packages of investments). In&#13;
terms of the return on labor, given an average 342 FCFA in salary (economic), the project showed the&#13;
potential to increase the average rate of return on labor several times. In financial terms, packages of&#13;
interventions that included the recommended percentages of productive and non-productive activities&#13;
had financial rates of return between 20 percent and 38 percent.&#13;
5.8   In economic terms, all packages of interventions had positive net present values. The economic&#13;
internal rate of return (EIRR) for project-supported packages, excluding the costs of capacity building,&#13;
land tenure clarification and project management, was 38.1 percent. With the addition of these&#13;
components, the EIRR was 13 percent, still above the assumed opportunity cost of capital (12 percent).&#13;
Since environmental benefits were not accounted for, it can be assumed that the economic rates of return&#13;
will actually be higher. When other non-quantifiable benefits such as Government and private sector&#13;
institution building are added, the project can be expected to have a high economic rate of return.&#13;
5.9    The results of the economic analysis are summarized in Annex 13. They are fully developed in a&#13;
technical report available in the project file.&#13;
C. RISKS&#13;
5.10   The principal project risks relate to: (a) the capacity of the Government to implement the&#13;
proposed program; (b) the' willingness and ability of communities to collaborate in planning,&#13;
implementing and funding development plans (c) potential social problems associated with&#13;
implementing land tenure clarification.&#13;
5.11   The inter-sectoral nature of the Project, and the decision to use existing institutions and financing&#13;
mechanisms are key to project success but entail risks. The project requires the cooperation of the&#13;
Ministries in charge of agriculture, finance, interior, and planning. While this is a risky proposition, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
activities supported by the Project address the needs of a single target population. By being supported&#13;
through one funding instrument, these activities will benefit from greater internal consistency, while the&#13;
costs and risks of duplication will be reduced. The Project has tried to address institutional risks by&#13;
ensuring that all institutions involved participated actively in project preparation. Project concept,&#13;
design, documentation and implementation arrangements were produced by an inter-ministerial task&#13;
force. This arrangement will continue during project implementation. Formnal detailed inter-ministerial&#13;
collaborative agreements were drafted by the concerned agencies. They have been drafted prior to&#13;
negotiations and discussed with IDA, and have been signed prior to Board presentation (see paragraph&#13;
6.2(a)). The fact that project coordination will be undertaken through the Office of the Prime Minister&#13;
should help ensure that inter-ministerial cooperation will benefit from the required high-level attention.&#13;
5.12   Communities may be reluctant to accept the planning methods and the financing arrangements&#13;
proposed by the Project. The reluctance of villages in a given pays rural to collaborate was identified as&#13;
a problem in the implementation of the FRAR. The legacy of the past may also hinder ongoing efforts to&#13;
make FRAR more responsive to expressed community needs, more transparent and more appreciated by&#13;
communities. This risk is addressed by devoting resources to support enhancement of community&#13;
capacity to articulate needs and manage decision-making and financing. This is further addressed by&#13;
separating responsibility for helping communities identify their needs and formulate LDPs (role played&#13;
by MSTs) from responsibility for helping them obtain and utilize financial resources (role played by the&#13;
FRAR).&#13;
5.13   The risks that (a) technological packages in the field of agriculture and rural infrastructure may&#13;
not be readily accepted and (b) that community financing may be lacking are high. The project addresses&#13;
these risks by (a) using packages consistent with those tested and adopted by ANADER and other&#13;
relevant national services; and (b) working only with interested groups, involving farmers in the planning&#13;
and selection of activities, and adjusting the estimated contributing capacity of the communities.&#13;
5.14   Other risks may stem from social perceptions and reactions to project support for clarification of&#13;
land tenure. After seven years of pilot operations involving over 235,000 people in the areas of the&#13;
country most affected by land tenure conflicts, and several thematic studies on specific issues and target&#13;
groups, this risk appears limited. The Project will nevertheless monitor social perceptions of land tenure&#13;
work and introduce necessary corrective measures as problems arise. Annual reviews will systematically&#13;
focus on land tenure and emerging social conflicts for consideration by the Government, the Bank and&#13;
other donors.&#13;
5.15   The Project involves a significant level of risk but is worthy of implementation. It will yield&#13;
large environmental and economic returns, channel resources where they are most needed, and leverage&#13;
and focus additional local community resources on rural development and environmental conservation.&#13;
D. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.16   The Project promotes sustainable agricultural development by focusing comprehensively on&#13;
production, the impact of production on the natural resource base, and the natural resource base's&#13;
capacity to sustain production in the long-tern. The most critical factors for Project sustainability are&#13;
found at the community and national Government levels.&#13;
5.17   Community ownership will be the first guarantee of sustainability. LDPs will be prepared with&#13;
external technical and financial assistance, but decisions will rest ultimately with the communities which&#13;
will be responsible for financing and managing implementation. Long-term sustainability at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
community level will become possible as improved land use, production systems and technologies are&#13;
promoted in communities that possess the necessary know-how, and legal, technical and financial tools&#13;
to properly design and implement plans.&#13;
5.18   On the national level, sustainability will depend upon the Government's continued commitment&#13;
to the approaches and activities of the Project after project termination. This is likely because the Project&#13;
supports decentralization and land tenure clarification which are, by definition, long-term Government&#13;
endeavors.&#13;
5.19   Recurrent costs represent less than 5 percent of the total cost of the Project during the&#13;
disbursement period. The Project was designed to emphasize investments and minimize recurrent&#13;
expenditures for the Government. Implementation support will be provided by local contractual staff,&#13;
and micro-enterprises. Assistance will terminate once targeted communities have been organized and&#13;
trained, their management plans designed and approved, and the main investments completed. The&#13;
Project's fiscal impact is limited and largely absorbed by the communities benefiting from the Project.&#13;
Details are provided in Annex 13. Following the project's disbursement period, communities will be&#13;
able to maintain investments and will need only limited additional technical support which can be&#13;
provided by technical ministries and the private sector. It is estimated that the recurrent costs for&#13;
communities will be 10 percent of the value of average investments per village per year, i.e., US$2,400&#13;
per village, or US$1.20 per capita. The expansion and maintenance of land tenure surveys will not be&#13;
costly (on a per ha basis) and are highly valued by beneficiaries; in the future, mechanisms could be&#13;
established to supply this service on a fee-for-service basis. Rural communes, will be established as part&#13;
of decentralization, will retain administrative and financial autonomy, and possess their own sources of&#13;
revenues; they will be in a position to ensure maintenance of assets. All communities will continue to be&#13;
eligible to benefit from Government financing opportunities through the FRAR, though the financing&#13;
available will be lower after the Project concludes.&#13;

Lettre d'Orientation du Gouvernement dans le&#13;
cadre du Projet National de Gestion des&#13;
Terroirs  et  d'Equipement  Rural&#13;
a Monsieur  le Chef  de  la Mission  R6sidente&#13;
Banque Mondiale Abidjan&#13;
La pr6sente lettre d'orientation a pour but de rappeler a&#13;
l'attention de nos partenaires au d6veloppement et des&#13;
institutions  nationales  le  cadre  l1gal,  reglementaire  et&#13;
institutionnel du PNGTER, ainsi que les strategies et objectifs qui&#13;
fondent la politique du Gouvernement en matiere de s6curisation&#13;
fonciAre et d'6quipement en milieu rural dans un contexte de&#13;
decentralisation.&#13;
I/ Bref Diagnostic des proLets et programmes de&#13;
d6velogpement&#13;
Le diagnostic des politiques et strategies dans les&#13;
domaines du developpement agricole, de l'amenagement du territoire et de la&#13;
Decentralisation, montre que diff,rentes voies ont et6 empruntees au cours&#13;
des vingt dernieres annees en vue de promouvoir une production&#13;
agricole soutenue et d'6quiper le milieu rural;&#13;
- Ainsi, plusieurs actions ont et6 entreprises a travers divers types&#13;
de projets tels que:&#13;
- les Projets de Developpement Rural lnt6gr6,&#13;
- les Projets R6gionaux de Developpement,&#13;
- les Projets Sectoriels,&#13;
- les Projets de Protection de l'Environnement,&#13;
- les Programmes FRAR;&#13;
Ces diff6rents projets et programmes ont eu des resultats positifs&#13;
ind6niables sur le developpement economique et social du milieu rural.&#13;
Toutefois, les 6valuations qui en ont ete faites ont de plus en plus montre&#13;
l'imperieuse necessite d'impliquer davantage les populations&#13;
rurales dans le processus de developpement.&#13;
II/ Nouvelles  Orientations  du   Gouvernement  et&#13;
justification du PNGTER&#13;
Ce constat a amen6 le Gouvernement a definir les orientations&#13;
suivantes:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55                                  ANNEX V&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
en matiere de ddveloppement rural durable&#13;
- le desengagement de I'Etat des activites productives au profit des&#13;
operateurs economiques dont les communautes rurales;&#13;
- la gestion des ressources naturelles et. Ia preservation de&#13;
1'environnement avec la responsabilisation et la participation des&#13;
communautes villageoises;&#13;
- la securisation fonciere&#13;
en   matiere  d'am6nagement  du  territoire  et  de&#13;
d6centralisation&#13;
- la poursuite de la reduction des disparites regionales,&#13;
- I'amelioration du cadre de vie en milieu rural a travers les&#13;
investissements sociaux, et des investissements productifs tenant compte des&#13;
potentialites locales;&#13;
- la  creation  de  conditions  favorables a une  grande&#13;
responsabilisation et une plus grande participation des cdmmunautes rurales&#13;
dans la definition des objectifs d'investissement, leur realisation et leur&#13;
gestion, notamment a travers le processus de decentralisation qui sera&#13;
poursuivi et amplifie par la creation de nouvelles communes et communautes&#13;
rurales en application de la loi n°95-892 du 27 octobre 1995 d'orientation sur&#13;
l'organisation generale de l'Administration Territoriale et de la loi n°95-893 du&#13;
27 octobre 1995 relative aux Communautes Rurales.&#13;
Afin de concretiser ces orientations, le Gouvernement s'appuyera&#13;
sur une approche qui implique une demarche participative des populations&#13;
aux differentes etapes de definition, de r6alisation et de gestion des objectifs&#13;
a atteindre.&#13;
La mise en oeuvre de cette politique a donc pr6sid6 a&#13;
l'id6e de preparation du Projet National de Gestion des Terroirs&#13;
et d'Equipement Rural (PNGTER) par le Gouverriement en relation&#13;
avec ses partenaires au developpement.&#13;
Ce projet sera donc un instrument de realisation des politiques et&#13;
programmes du Gouvernement en matiere de developpement agricole&#13;
durable, de decentralisation et d'amenagement du territoire.&#13;
II s'articulera autour de 3 composantes principales:&#13;
- la securisation fonciere, en facilitant l'acces au droit modeme des&#13;
parcelles objets de droits coutumiers et en prenant en compte les realites&#13;
rurales,&#13;
- la gestion des terroirs,&#13;
- I'appui a l'lnvestissement en milieu rural.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX V&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
III/ Orientations du Gouvernement sur les differentes&#13;
como2osantes d! projet&#13;
3.1 Securisation fonciere&#13;
A travers cette composante le Gouvernement entend securiser la&#13;
tenure fonciere, garantie perrnettant aux acteurs ruraux d'investir durablement&#13;
dans la capital foncier productif tant au plan individuel que collectif.&#13;
Le Gouvernement a donc entame une clarification de la situation&#13;
fonciere avec les phases pilotes du PFR a etendre dans le cadre du projet.&#13;
II s'agit d'instaurer des procedures simples et moins onereuses&#13;
devant d6boucher a terme sur&#13;
- I'acceleration des procedures d'immatriculation des tenures et de&#13;
publication des droits des collectivites coutumieres au livre foncier,&#13;
- I'emission de titres juridiques de propriete  au profit des&#13;
communautes villageoises et leur implication dans la gestion de ces titres.&#13;
Le Gouvernement a deja mis en chantier une r6flexion d'ensemble&#13;
sur le droit foncier, qui pourrait &amp; terme aboutir a un projet de code foncier&#13;
rural.&#13;
3.2 La Gestion des Terroirs des Communautes Rurales&#13;
Dans l'entendement du Gouvernement, I'approche&#13;
gestion des Terroirs devra etre pergue comme une fonction&#13;
d'animation et d'organisation des communaut6s rurales qui devra&#13;
conduire a un processus participatif de ces communautes a&#13;
- l'identification des contraintes qui devront etre levees pour&#13;
favoriser un developpement durable,&#13;
- l'identification des actions d'investissements sociaux et productifs&#13;
necessaires pour lever ces contraintes,&#13;
- l'identification des interets des groupes specifiques (Femmes,&#13;
Jeunes, et autres),&#13;
- la mobilisation des financements necessaires pour les&#13;
realisations,&#13;
- la gestion et la maintenance des realisations.&#13;
Cette approche devra etre multidisciplinaire et multisectorielle de&#13;
maniere a ce que les communautes rurales beneficient d'un d6veloppement&#13;
plus integre et plus equilibre.&#13;
Les objectifs vises par le Gouvernement a travers, cette&#13;
approche de gestion participative sont&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
ANNEX V&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
- a court et moyen terme, fournir aux communautes rurales la&#13;
capacite d'entreprendre et de realiser des activites permettant d'ameliorer&#13;
leur cadre de vie, leur environnement et leur revenu.&#13;
- a moyen et long terme, foumir a ces communautes l'autorite et les&#13;
pouvoirs administratifs et juridiques leur permettant de gerer elles-memes&#13;
leurs terroirs.&#13;
Pour mener a bien cette fonction transitoire d'animation rurale, le&#13;
Gouvernement s'attellera a mettre en place un instrument d'appui aux&#13;
populations a travers des equipes de Gestion des Terroirs (EGT). Ces&#13;
equipes issues du secteur prive ou d'ONG nationales seront constituees par&#13;
un nouveau profil d'agents d'animation ayant une vue plurisectorielle du&#13;
developpement. Les EGT seront contractees sous le couvert d'un op6rateur&#13;
public deja engage dans le developpement rural. A la fin de la periode&#13;
quinquennale d'execution du PNGTER, dans le cadre du desengagement de&#13;
l'Etat et d'amplification de la decentralisation et de la regionalisation, ces&#13;
equipes pourront etre absorbees par les nouvelles communautes rurales a&#13;
cr6er.&#13;
Pour le Gouvernement, cette approche de gestion devra se situer&#13;
en amont du processus des FRAR et devra tenir au maximum compte des&#13;
grandes orientations politiques nationales en matiere d'Amenagement du&#13;
Territoire et de Developpement Regional. Elle permettra egalement de&#13;
preparer les populations a la prise en main des problemes de developpement&#13;
local&#13;
- La Gestion des Terroirs devra s'associer etroitement au Plan&#13;
Foncier Rural, creuset d'une securisation fonciere future et d'une gestion&#13;
rationnelle des terres au niveau local.&#13;
Tous les efforts seront entrepris pour une meilleure coordination&#13;
entre les differentes administrations pour ce qui est de l'articulation de&#13;
l'approche Gestion des Terroirs aux actions'd6ja en cours dont les FRAR, les&#13;
Comites r6gionaux et locaux de d6veloppement, et les autres projets.&#13;
Pour une meilleure internalisation de cette nouvelle approche au&#13;
niveau de tous les acteurs du developpement, des actions de formation et de&#13;
sensibilisation de ces acteurs seront entreprses a l'echelle nationale et&#13;
regionale.&#13;
3.3 L'Appui a l'lnvestissement en milieu Rural (FRAR)&#13;
Pour le Gouvernement le financement des investissements&#13;
collectifs en milieu rural devra se faire dans toute la mesure du possib4e par le&#13;
canal des Fonds R6gionaux d'Am6nagement-urai (-RAH) aeja en place et&#13;
fonctionnels dont il s'agira d'ameliorer les procedures, notamment en matiere&#13;
d'allegement des forrnalites et de reduction des delais.&#13;
&#13;

En outre le Gouvernement entend prevoir dans le cadre de ces&#13;
financements la prise en compte d'une plus grande proportion d'activites.&#13;
productives en plus des investissements sociaux classiques. 11 sera envisage&#13;
une strategie de financement des projets sous forme de paquets&#13;
d'investissements productifs et sociaux de maniere a ce que l'ensemble soit&#13;
viable economiquement et permette aux b6n6ficiaires de degager des&#13;
ressources pour les charges recurrentes et d'assurer la perennite de ces&#13;
investissements. Une meilleure prise en compte des groupes specifiques&#13;
(femmes et jeunes) sera egalement envisag6e.&#13;
Un accent particulier sera mis sur la maitrise d'ouvrage des&#13;
populations beneficiaires des projets.&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
Pour le Gouvemement les actions des differents bailleurs de fonds&#13;
dans ce secteur devront s'inscrire dans le cadre ci-dessus defini et etre&#13;
compl6mentaires. De.preference,des co-financements. sont souhaites.&#13;

MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
Overview: The monitoring and evaluation system will based on two types of indicators: The first&#13;
indicators will measure progress along physical and fnancial parameters. These will be followed by the&#13;
coding of all project expenditures by project objective, component, type of activity, sub-activity, status,&#13;
location, and category of procurement, disbursement and source of funding. The resulting information will&#13;
be integrated by the financial management system which will use a suitable, fully tested, commercial&#13;
software for this purpose. The software will also permit the Project to record information on not-yet&#13;
disbursed and pending commitments. The system will be able to make available data on expenditures,&#13;
commitments and statistics of works by category of work, location, funding source, reporting periods, etc.&#13;
Achievements will be measured against annual budgets and workplans.&#13;
The second type of indicators will consist of a limited number of key parameters aimed at providing a first&#13;
indication of the Project's development impact. These indicators are presented in the following table. They&#13;
include physical parameters as proxies for the Project's impact as well as some behavioral indicators. The&#13;
list of indicators is presented at the end of this Annex. It includes, for example: (a) number of land titles&#13;
issued and area covered, (b) percentage of land under dispute out of the total land covered under the&#13;
Clarification of Land Tenure component, (c) value of land management investments made on land with&#13;
clarified land tenure status as opposed to comparable land with un-certified legal status (sample 5 percent&#13;
of villages); (d) number of LDPs approved, financed, being implemented in Project years III, IV and V; (e)&#13;
proportion of village land placed under the sustainable management systems promoted by the Project in&#13;
selected villages (5 percent of total); (f) number of fully operational village and inter-village interest groups&#13;
undertaking Project generated initiatives; and (g) the level of fnancing provided in cash by local&#13;
communities.&#13;
T-he information provided by indicators will be complemented by surveys and assessments on specific&#13;
themes such as the evaluation of poverty in sample Project areas, and the impact of selected Project-&#13;
supported activities on women and other target groups. The primary features of the project's monitoring&#13;
system have been oulined in the draft Implementation Manual prior to negotiations. The selected key&#13;
development impact indicators been have formally agreed upon at negotiation and mentioned in a sideline&#13;
letter signed by the Government.&#13;
Defnitions and Background.:&#13;
Stakeholders: (i) Agencies in charge of the various components, (ii) donors, (iii) beneficiaries which must&#13;
be involved in the monitoring process, and (iv) the 5 specialized M&amp;E units in the agencies (see&#13;
organigram). These units will meet regularly and constitute the M&amp;E Committee (M&amp;EC).&#13;
Data and reports: These data must be gathered and circulated from the beneficiaries and local agencies to&#13;
the Project Management Unit (PMU). External monitoring will concentrate on a set of indicators including&#13;
status indicators as well as performance and impact indicators. A set of performance and impact indicators&#13;
is given in Table XX.&#13;
Procedures. They regulate the circulation of information among stakeholders. For Internal M&amp;E each&#13;
component will use its own procedures. Such procedures exist already in ANADER and FRAR and will be&#13;
used for PNGTER but had to be defined for PFR (see Annex XX). For external monitoring, procedures are&#13;
defined in the Operating Manual.&#13;
&#13;

Tools. In the first period, only central units in Abidjan will use computerized systems for M&amp;E. On the&#13;
field standards table will be filled out at the beginning. In order to ensure easy gathering of M&amp;E data,&#13;
identical software (DBMS and GIS) will be provided to the various agencies and to the PMU. FRAR M&amp;E&#13;
system will be the reference for the other two components. Advise, technical assistance and training will be&#13;
provided by FRARto implement these tools in the other two components. Programmed and Realized&#13;
activities will cover 1000 villages. Use of GIS in relation with DBMS will facilitate visualization of project&#13;
achievements. CNTIG has receive mandate to develop the GIS database using data at scale 1:200.000 and&#13;
train the various agencies for its operational use. A3 format maps will be printed and included in the main&#13;
reports.&#13;
Data, Reports and procedures&#13;
The number of documents and indicators have been minimized as well as the number of M&amp;E meetings.&#13;
The main documents are the following.&#13;
M&amp;E manual: the document must be established before project implementation along with the Operation&#13;
Manual . PFRPU will set up a specific Operating Manual including M&amp;E description. M&amp;E manual gives&#13;
a precise description of each of the 3 main reports (Strategic Plans, Annual Working Plan and Annual&#13;
Report) as well as a definitive version of the Tableau de Bord.&#13;
Tableau de Bord. The Tableau de Bord is the table of objectives of the project and of each component as&#13;
well as the list of performance and impact indicators. Before negotiation, a yearly target value will be&#13;
given to each indicator after negotiation between government, agencies and donors.&#13;
Strategic Plans (SP) (3 years). They describe activities for the coming 3 years. There are prepared by the&#13;
M&amp;EC and provide to the Pilot Committee (PC) for its approbation before the 15th of November of the&#13;
previous year. Programmation unit is the SP is 3 months. They include global budget and A3 format maps.&#13;
Annual Working Plans. They are prepared by each component after SP approval. Regional proposals will&#13;
be gathered by central units and M&amp;EC will meet to harmonize proposal to the PC. They must be approved&#13;
by the PC before the 15th of December. Programmations units are 15 days and villages. They include&#13;
detailed budget for each activity and A3 format maps.&#13;
Annual Reports. (AP). They are prepared by each component before the 15th of January. They refer to&#13;
AWP established for the past year. They will be integrated into one project AP by M&amp;EC. They include 4&#13;
chapters: (i) the Tableau de Bord with indicator observe value and discrepancy, (ii) list of activities and&#13;
expenses in reference with AWP, (iii) summary of specific M&amp;E studies undertaken during the past year&#13;
(see paragraph below), and (iv) Explanations about main issues and main discrepancies between program&#13;
and realization as well as actions done and to be done to mitigate these issues. PNGTER has two type of&#13;
activities: process (repetitive) activities and non repititive activities. Non repetitive activities can be&#13;
managed in using a classical GANTT diagram. A3 format maps of programmation/realization gaps will be&#13;
added to each report.&#13;
Specific M&amp;E reports. Some studies and surveys will be undertaken by consultants for answering specific&#13;
question such as gender issues or origin of village financial participation to project activities. Generally&#13;
these surveys will take place after mid-review in order to measure project first impact.&#13;
&#13;

Technical Specification and Process&#13;
Reminder of obiectives: This component will be instrumental in securing land rights and developing&#13;
private and governmental capacity to survey land rights, provide titles to interested land rights holders and&#13;
manage land tenure information. The component will expand the ongoing Plan Foncier Rural (PFR),&#13;
increase its efficiency and help establish a long-term institutional arrangements for its continuation and&#13;
continuous update. It will take stock of techniques tested over a seven year period.&#13;
Outputs: The prime outcome will be the production of paper maps and implementation of a digital&#13;
database called a Land Information System (LIS). Current land use and other demographic and land-related&#13;
information will be recorded to help guide community and government decision-making regarding land&#13;
management, the location of access roads and other physical infrastructure, transhumance corridors, forest&#13;
boundaries, and small irrigation works. In a country where large scale mapping is still very poor, this&#13;
multipurpose cadastral information system will also contribute to many sector development efforts and&#13;
meet the needs of several users.&#13;
Process: A chart outlining the critical phases of the production process and the flow of activities is&#13;
presented on the following page. There are two major operations: (1) establishment of a land information&#13;
system in new areas, and (2) maintenance and management of land rights information.&#13;
Establishment of a Land Information System in new areas: (1) This first operation was tested during the&#13;
PFR and encompasses four types of activities: (1.a) preparation which includes global studies, awareness&#13;
raising campaigns targeted on local people and establishment of photomaps to support further field&#13;
surveying, (1.b) land and land rights surveying, (I.c) LIS implementation and map printing and (1.d)&#13;
publicity, and dissemination of maps and information at the local and national levels.&#13;
Prevaration (I.a) and field work (I.b): These two activities have been mastered by the PFR regional and&#13;
central teams. Each team will survey between 400 and 1000 hectares per month, depending upon the type&#13;
of land. Classical methods of topographic surveying will be used, employing photomosaic or orthophotos&#13;
at 1:10.000 scale as the background. Each village map will be georeferenced with its absolute coordinate&#13;
stored in a national database using GPS equipment. Field surveys of land use and land rights will be&#13;
undertaken field by field, in the presence of the land user, the land owner, neighbors and the village chief&#13;
or other representative of senior citizenry. Surveys will be managed at the regional level by Regional&#13;
Offices. Surveys will be completed only for lands where no disputes are pending.&#13;

Risk and OODortunities: Evolution of techniques durinu PNGTER&#13;
(1), (2) and (3): During PNGTER there may be changes in the techniques or the technical arrangements&#13;
used to complete these three phases:&#13;
(1): Orthophoto maps are becoming common. In the next few years, relevant knowledge and skills may be&#13;
transferred to a local agency like CCT. The potential for use of very high resolution satellite imagery(I-3&#13;
m) should also be checked into as soon as it becomes available. Price reductions are expected.&#13;
(2) The land surveying process will benefit from introduction of GPS.&#13;
(3) Digitalization is a simple process but it requires a great deal of effort. Use of the simplest tools is&#13;
recommended. Production lines should only be set-up in the regions where capacity is sufficient for&#13;
maintenance. Subcontracting of these operations to the local private sector is recommended to reduce cost,&#13;
increase flexibility and enable the transfer of PFR to MINAGRA without adding government personnel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX X&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
LIS imnlementation fl.c0 and dissemination of information (I.d). LIS implementation (l.c) is relatively&#13;
new for PFR although several maps have already been digitized. Digital formatting is required for&#13;
processing and updating the large amount of data to be gathered by the Project. Implementation will be&#13;
gradual, and simple equipment and software will be used. Part of digitalization process will be done in the&#13;
Regional Office and by the private sector in Abidjan. Following completion of the land rights survey,&#13;
information will be made public and any claimant will be able to register disagreement. After three months&#13;
without conflicting claims over a given parcel, the land tenure status will be considered certified.&#13;
Digitalization and integration of the data into a national database will be challenging for the PFRPU. This&#13;
operation cannot be transferred to SADR until it is mastered by PFRPU. LIS equipment and technical&#13;
assistance will be required. Terms of Reference for the LIS will be establish by the PFRPU. They must be&#13;
consistent with the various items described in the Budget. Because of the limited regional capacity to&#13;
maintain equipment, subcontracting the digitalization process to the local private sector is recommended.&#13;
Terms of reference will need to be specific regarding the following items, which will have a major impact&#13;
on and LIS design and management: (i) digitalization methods and arrangements, (ii) data transfer and&#13;
storage, (iii) management of the data over time, and (iv) possible use of new technologies and techniques&#13;
such as numerical orthophotos and very high resolution satellite imagery.&#13;
LIS implementation requires the ability to georeference all survey information with absolute geographic&#13;
coordinates. Geodetic network quality is currenlty uneven in Cote d'lvoire. This component will help&#13;
establish a national geodetic network under CCT responsibility. It will set up a point in each village&#13;
surveyed and provide equipment (3 GPS bi-frequence) to CCT. For densification, 6 GPS monofrequency&#13;
will be acquired by PFRPU. In each village, one geodetic point will be created and maintained by the&#13;
community.&#13;
Maintenance and manazement of land information. The long-term success of the land tenure security&#13;
instruments will depend upon the capacity created to support government institutions (primarily the rural&#13;
Land Tenure Services) and the commitment of villagers to update regularly the land rights record. Though&#13;
village boundaries are usually fixed, changes in land ownership and distribution inside the confines of the&#13;
village (among lineage groups and households) take place frequently and need to be recorded. Data&#13;
updating and maintenance is new for the PFR and will be handled by SADR. PFRPU will concentrate on&#13;
LIS maintenance. Community involvement will be required for updating basic data. A Local Land Tenure&#13;
Group will be established in each village and a permanent secretary of the Group will gather information&#13;
on the changes in land rights and transmit them to the BADR in charge of maintenance. These modification&#13;
will be validated by a Committee. Sous-Prefets, BADR, LLTG and villages representative will belong to&#13;
this committee and will meet every three months. The committee will request BADR field support when&#13;
necessary. BADR will also be in charge of disseminating maps and non-cartographic information. Specific&#13;
arrangements and procedures are described in the MOP.&#13;
The Project will help create the necessary motivation and technical capacity at the institutional and&#13;
community levels to ensure that updating becomes routine for institutions and local communities.&#13;
Establishment of a Local Land Tenure Group in each village with a permanent secretary, and training of&#13;
villagers and political authorities will help ensure that amendment of land rights records is demand-driven:&#13;
specialized teams based in the Regional Land Tenure Service offices will respond to requests from local&#13;
people to update records. Regional Land Tenure Service staff will be trained and equipped specifically to&#13;
respond to community requests and periodically visit villages to monitor changes in land rights.&#13;
Scope of vroiect operations. Over 2 million hectares will be covered in five years. The Project will support&#13;
the reinforcement (including training and equipment) of five existing Regional Offices (RO) and&#13;
establishment of four new ROs. Each RO will manage 5 to 7 Regional Survey Teams (RST) of 3&#13;
technicians, either contracted individually or in the form of micro-enterprises. Regional Survey Teams&#13;
(RST) will be composed of an extension agent, a topographer and an interviewer. Support will be also&#13;
provided at the central level to ensure centralized purchase of aerial photos, LIS implementation, quality&#13;
control, and coordination of field operations and links with institutional partners.&#13;

Responsibilities and institutional arrangement&#13;
Relationships between PFRPU and SADR. The Land Tenure Component will expand on-going PFR&#13;
activities managed by the PFR Project Unit (PFRPU) within BNETD. The component will be managed by&#13;
SADR and transfer of competence will be progressive between PFRPU and SADR PFRPU will play a key&#13;
role in management and transfer of competence. Prior to implementation, an agreement will be signed&#13;
between the Ministry and BNETD to clarify the relationship between SADR and. The main clauses of the&#13;
agreement will be the following: (i) copyright on data: SADR will own the data produced by the PFRPU.&#13;
PFRPU will be able to sell the data with agreement and fair remuneration of SADR; (ii)reimbursement of&#13;
PRFPU services: SADR will reimburse all the expenses of BNETD. Invoices will not provide for profit;&#13;
only the total cost of the services will be included; (iii) maintenance will be SADR's responsibility with the&#13;
exception of LIS updating; and (iv) technical equipment and vehicles will be provided by SADR to&#13;
BNETD.&#13;
Relationships between PFR and Cadaster (Service du Cadaster). The Cadaster has been involved in the&#13;
project design. Cadaster will be strengthened by the project to ensure that PFR cartographic information is&#13;
sufficiently accurate to establish the tableau d'assemblage and the individual titles, and guarantee the&#13;
ability to utilize PFR informnation. A specific agreement will describe the document format required to&#13;
enable cadaster use of PFR data, and outline the procedures necessary to enable titling when required by&#13;
individuals or communities. The main requests formulated by the cadaster will be the following: (i) use of&#13;
"'grand aigle" (cadaster format) for the tableau d'assemblage; (ii) use of cadaster format for individual&#13;
titles; (iii) identification of geodetic points on the maps; (iv) placement of geodetic point in each village;&#13;
(v) signature by cartographic engineers of the non-definitive title elaborate by the PFR; (vi) guarantee that&#13;
when operations are subcontracted to the private sector a surveyor recognized by the Cadaster is included&#13;
in the team.&#13;
Management&#13;
Accounting and monitoring. PFRPU will acquire an accounting system for monitoring cost and&#13;
establishing DRF. It will also implement a system to program and monitor the RST interventions. At the&#13;
central level a monitoring system will use a DBMS tool and GIS for spatial representation of PFR progress.&#13;
At the regional level, large format sheets will be used, and data will be provided to the central level on&#13;
spreadsheets software compatible with the DBMS used in Abidjan. The accounting system will enable cost&#13;
surveying by region and by type of expenses.&#13;
Operatine Manual. In order to enable coordination among the various regions, private sector sub-&#13;
contractors and PFR, an operating manual will be developed by the PFRPU. It will include the following&#13;
chapters: Quality Standards for maps and thematic information, ISO 900x will be used; Updating and&#13;
maintenance operations and procedures; and Monitoring systems including performance ratio and&#13;
standards costs.&#13;
Human Resources Management. The PFRPU will recruit and manage staff in 9 different regions. The&#13;
Project manager will be assisted by the CFO in establishing job profiles, selecting technicians and&#13;
evaluating their performance. In order to minimize administrative constraints, the manager will be&#13;
responsible to the CEO of BNTED. In order to motivate the RST and increase performance, up to 20% of&#13;
remuneration will be based upon their results. Initial global performance will to cover 2.000.000 hectares&#13;
in 5 years. Each region will have a specific target according to the specifics of the landscape.&#13;
Circulation of Information between the stakeholders. Survey teams will deposit maps in the relevant&#13;
Regional and Central Land Tenure Service offices of MINAGRA. Copies will also be left with the villages&#13;
and sub-prefect. Land rights registers, indicating village, lineage and plot boundaries and recording claims&#13;
to land as well as current and potential land uses will also be deposited as indicated above. The records&#13;
will serve as reference materials for general information and planning purposes, and, most importantly, for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

resolving possible future disputes. In each village, land tenure information will be maintained by a&#13;
designated village representative (or by the mayor in locations where a commune rurale has been&#13;
established). The sub-prefect office will maintain the information in paper format. The Regional Land&#13;
Tenure Service offices will maintain the information in digital format.&#13;
Land Tenure Legislation&#13;
The fundamental principle of land tenure legislation in Cote d'Ivoire is that all land rights are vested in the&#13;
State. Current land tenure legislation is largely based upon two colonial decrees from the 1930s which&#13;
have been modified by post-independence decrees. Legal procedures for obtaining individual freehold title&#13;
to land are defined in a decree issued on July 25, 1932 saying that private claims and the acquisition of title&#13;
can be based upon evidence of active land use. A subsequent decree of November 15, 1935 reaffirmed the&#13;
principle that all unoccupied land belonged to the State, and stipulated the State's right to seize lands if&#13;
they had not been used for more than ten years. The 1935 decree held that even land in use under&#13;
customary law could be expropriated by the government given economic justification. In 1955, a decree on&#13;
May 17 renounced public claims to vacant, unoccupied or unexploited land; in order to stake a claim to&#13;
land it was necessary to demonstrate that the land was either not subject to customary law or that the&#13;
customary claimants had waived their rights to the land. In 1957, a decree established expropriation&#13;
procedures that are still in force today. To implement expropriation procedures, land must be the subject of&#13;
a definitive grant and must not have been exploited for at least five years. A fair compensation scheme is&#13;
spelled out in the 1957 decree and 1958 implementing regulation (regulation 8868 of October 28, 1958&#13;
outlines the rules for application of decree 57-243, issued on February 24, 1957).&#13;
Land tenure registration was established under colonial rule and is part of the current land law of C6te&#13;
d'Ivoire. Despite its avowed support for registration, the government has taken few steps to ease the&#13;
stringent requirements for acquiring land title that were inherited from the French. Individuals seeking&#13;
legal possession of land can obtain it either on a temporary or a definitive basis from the State. Temporary&#13;
concessions such as occupation permits and "concessions subject to claims by a third party" are the&#13;
simplest and least costly means of obtaining land for private use. The registration process begins by&#13;
recognizing that no customary rights may be claimed over the land and that land must be registered in the&#13;
name of the State before it is granted to individuals. Only 12 hectares can be registered at any one time.&#13;
The remainder of the concession can be leased long-term; therefore, an individual seeking to purchase a&#13;
large area would have to survey and register the tract in 12 hectare parcels. Alternatively, an individual&#13;
could purchase twelve hectares and lease the remaining area.&#13;
After independence, the Government sought to establish the primacy of State rights and modern tenure&#13;
procedures over customary law. In 1963, a bill declaring that all unused or unregistered land was the&#13;
property of the State was prepared but never promulgated. More significant, a March 20, 1967 decree&#13;
declared that "land belongs to whomever exploits it, provided that exploitation rights have been formally&#13;
registered". The need for formal land registration has never been recognized or enforced, and registration&#13;
has little significance to residents. The benefits of registration are usually poorly understood by local&#13;
communities, especially when their land is leased or granted to foreigners. Additionally, definitive land&#13;
rights ("title") are obtainable only after survey and registration, a time-consuming process that costs more&#13;
than FCFA 100,000 per hectare.&#13;
Customary transactions are still pervasive. In practice, all lands remain subject to customary law and any&#13;
attempt to exploit or develop land must take place with the explicit cooperation of traditional authorities.&#13;
Old Practices, and new procedures&#13;
It is commonly accepted in C6te d'lvoire that land tenure security is ensured when a documented claim to&#13;
land exists and parcel limits are marked. The PFR has been helping to create the basic documentation that&#13;
can be used to secure land tenure. Data collected by PFR teams have been used to answer questions related&#13;
to land rights by identifying: (i) the limits of community, lineage and family plots, (ii) the nature of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX X&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
rights enjoyed by tenants and the terms by which they can be transferred; (iii) the lands ceded to foreigners&#13;
and migrants, (iv) the methods for protecting the rights users, and (v) approaches to resolving conflicts&#13;
over land.&#13;
PFR results have shown that under customary tenure, land is primarily owned by groups (family, tribe,&#13;
lineage) or by overlapping groups, while rights are exercised by individual members of the group.&#13;
Foreigners sometimes have land rights on an informal basis on land village authorities have given them.&#13;
Therefore, registration of customary land rights involves certain policy concerns. When adjudicating, the&#13;
problem is to determine how ownership and rights are divided among the individual, the group and the&#13;
government. Principles for resolution of the issues must be defined and ambiguities resolved regarding the&#13;
registration of unused land, the policy regarding group ownership, and the registration of land as&#13;
"customary land". For unused land (which is very rare), the current legal answer is that these areas belong&#13;
to the State. For land on which divided and overlapping rights are exercised, it is preferable not to alter the&#13;
current balance between customary and modern law.&#13;
There is the common misconception that registration of title is inconsistent with community, lineage or&#13;
family ownership, and that it connotes individual ownership. Under customary law a "group" can own&#13;
land. Local communities, especially in the Korhogo region, view land as a collective resource bequeathed&#13;
from ancestors and held in trust for future generations. The oldest living male member of the village often&#13;
acts as landlord and allocates land rights. The government, through its local representative (le sous-prefet),&#13;
allocates unused lands according to law enacted under colonial rule.&#13;
Customary control and distribution of land among communities is changing. Landlords and lineage chiefs&#13;
still retain control over land, overseeing a large percentage of transactions including sales, however, land&#13;
holding rights are becoming fragmented. Nonetheless, very little land is legally transferred according to&#13;
formal Ivoirian laws. This is generally attributed to the general population's ignorance of the laws and the&#13;
high costs associated with land registration; no explanation is given for why the State does not enforce land&#13;
law.&#13;
Informal and formal land tenure systems currently coexist, introducing uncertainty into the land rights&#13;
situation. Disputes are frequent in some regions, where it is unclear which rights are being transferred&#13;
when land is "sold", "granted", "leased" or "lent". Some communities claim that they sell cultivation&#13;
rights but still possess the land. Others argue that sales are actually short-to-medium term leases and that&#13;
land must be returned after a certain period.&#13;
The new legal framework for rural communities (regime des communautes rurales-- enacted through the&#13;
Law 95-832) will encourage a dialogue involving customary authorities at the village level and government&#13;
representatives at the local level. In order to reconcile customary and modern dictates, PNGTER will&#13;
support registration of all land surveyed by the PFR in the name of the Government, and issuance of titles&#13;
to village communities. This will give rural communities confidence in the Government institutions and&#13;
create an incentive for sustainable management of land. Village authorities, as described in the Law 95-&#13;
892, will be charged to manage and control village land titles; in the future, changes in title will not be&#13;
allowable without village authorities' acceptance. Long-term divisibility of land title may be allowable&#13;
based upon a request by members of the village that is endorsed by village authorities and registered by&#13;
local government representatives. Under the new system, government officials will no longer have the&#13;
power to give new residents use rights for village lands without the permission of village authorities.&#13;
Traditional land rights will be reinforced and complemented by the governmental monitoring of land&#13;
registration and transactions.&#13;
Land tide registration and issuance will become easier and quicker. After an initial period when it will be&#13;
free, charges can be levied to compensate for cost incurred by the Government. Overall costs will remain&#13;
however affordable even for the poorest.&#13;

All measures supported by the project facilitate the fulfillment of conditions and requirements for the&#13;
acquisition of rural land tenure security and land titles without introducing fundamental changes in the&#13;
existing land tenure law. Steps have been taken to (a) officially recognize the PFR documentation,&#13;
including the mapping documentation that will be used officially to register the surveyed lands in the name&#13;
of the government' (This documentation will also help resolve future land rights disputes.); (b) issue&#13;
village community land title (Title must be reproduced in the "grand livre foncier"); (c) establish Rural&#13;
Land Tenure Commissions (RLTC) by Inter-ministerial Arrete (Ministries of Interior/Finance/Agriculture).&#13;
These will be chaired by a Sub-prefect and will include: a representative of MINAGRA, a representative of&#13;
the national cadaster, a magistrate, and representatives of local customary and elected authorities. The&#13;
RLTCs will guarantee the veracity of land tenure documentation produced through the project and will be&#13;
empowered to resolve conflicts at the request of local administrative and traditional authorities; (d) enact a&#13;
joint regulation (Ministry of Finance-Interior and Ministry of Agriculture) that defines, based upon PFR&#13;
pilot phase experience, the survey norms and rules for future rural land registration; (e) strengthen the&#13;
capacity of MINAGRA's Service of Rural Domain (SADR) to continuously update land tenure information&#13;
and liaise with the national cadaster.&#13;
'PFR documentation includes: a land use plan and land rights register, indicating village, lineage and&#13;
parcel boundaries and recording the various claims to these lands.&#13;

Republic of C6te d'Ivoire&#13;
RURAL LAND MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (PNGTER)&#13;
Summary of Project Environmental Impact&#13;
The project has been designed to help enhance the standard of living of C6te d'Ivoire's rural population by&#13;
empowering communities, stimulating local investment and facilitating sustainable management of natural&#13;
resources and rural infrastructure. The project will facilitate sustainable community-based management of&#13;
resources by helping consolidate the incentive framework, and strengthening human and institutional&#13;
capacity to manage local resources. This will be combined with assistance to develop locally-appropriate&#13;
management plans. Financing and long-term incentives will help ensure that management plans are&#13;
implemented and reinforce the inclusive planning and management process established. The project&#13;
includes four components:&#13;
(a) Clarification of Land Tenure. Land surveying, mapping and land tenure clarification will be&#13;
undertaken to: certify land rights, facilitate conflict resolution, and help identify land management&#13;
and development options.&#13;
(b) Enhancement of Local Management Capacity. Based upon the maps and information&#13;
obtained through the Clarification of Land Tenure component, communities will be assisted to&#13;
participatorily develop Local Development Plans (LDP), that outline what is needed to sustainably&#13;
manage agricultural, pasture and forest land as well as associated water resources, and to develop&#13;
and maintain infrastructure. Rural communes, community organizations and interested groups&#13;
will be strengthened to facilitate self-governance and maintenance of infrastructure and assets&#13;
(c) Financing of Local Investments. Financing will be provided to enhance community&#13;
investment capacity and implement Local Development Plans (LDP).&#13;
(d) Support for Decentralization and Coordination. The Project will provide targeted material&#13;
support and training to locally-elected governing bodies. The Project will also facilitate inter-&#13;
institutional coordination and monitoring of policies and programs launched under the Project.&#13;
The design of PNGTER minimizes potentially negative enviromnental impacts by fostering consideration&#13;
of social, environmental, economic and cultural factors in community planning and decision making. The&#13;
holistic planning process fostered and facilitated by PNGTER will result in the creation of sustainable&#13;
development plans; most of the potentially negative project-related impacts will be avoided or mitigated in&#13;
the planning process.&#13;
Prior to appraisal of this project an independent environmental impact assessment was commissioned&#13;
during which extensive field visits were undertaken, mainly to observe environmental conditions in&#13;
different agro-ecological zones of the country and to present the project to local communities. Numerous&#13;
contacts with all relevant Government institutions were also made.&#13;
Positive environmental imDacts.&#13;
The timely implementation of the project itself will have considerable positive enviromnental impacts since&#13;
it will help halt destructive and un-sustainable uses of natural resources. The decentralization of rural land&#13;
management and empowerment of local communities will probably- provide an incentive for improving&#13;
agricultural practices and increasing investment in the rural sector. Improved land tenure security also&#13;
favors more sustainable uses of natural resources. The following table highlights the key positive&#13;
environmental impacts stemming from the project.&#13;

Potentially negative environmental impacts&#13;
The potential negative environmental impacts of the project may result from the infrastructure- or&#13;
agriculture-related project activities. They are elaborated in detail in the full environmental impact&#13;
assessment report. The related risks are technically simple to mitigate; most project components already&#13;
take them into account. If the project is carefully implemented and monitored, the negative environmental&#13;
impacts will either be mitigated before they appear or avoided completely. The primary potentially&#13;
negative environmental impacts and related mitigation measures are summarized in the following table:&#13;

Mitieation plan.&#13;
The mitigation plan involves standard technical mitigation measures (as described in the right column of&#13;
the above table) but also bases itself on careful institutional arrangements and division of responsibilities.&#13;
The plan relies primarily on: (a) monitoring and evaluation, (b) an environmental information system and&#13;
(c) training (at the institutional and rural levels). The total incremental cost associated with the mitigation&#13;
plan is approximately 1% of total project cost. The low figure can be attributed primarily to the fact that&#13;
the project is designed to reduce the associated negative environmental impacts, and includes efficient&#13;
monitoring, evaluation and information systems that will help the project avoid negative environmental&#13;
impacts before they arise. The above-mentioned components and the overall project design foster the&#13;
mainstreaming of environment in the project. The primary steps in the mitigation plan (for the first three&#13;
years) are summarized in the table below. Most of the steps listed are integrated into project design.&#13;
Specific studies will be undertaken during the first phase of project, particularly regarding evolution in the&#13;
use and predominance of tree crops, and the management of wetlands and small irrigated schemes. It is&#13;
also recommended that regional monographs on the basic social, economic and environmental situation in&#13;
the project area be undertaken in order to complement and consolidate the information that has been&#13;
gathered. These studies will enable the project team to fine tune the mitigation plan as it is implemented.&#13;

The demand-driven approach promoted by the project makes it impossible to identify ex ante the specific&#13;
positive and negative environmental risks that will be engendered in each community. The selection of&#13;
specific interventions is an important component of the project itself; mitigation of risks will therefore need&#13;
to be based partly on review and evaluation of the individual land management and infrastructure&#13;
development plans produced. Additionally, the project proscribes that all community development plans&#13;
and investments be screened for negative environmental consequences and comply with standard&#13;
specification that minimize risks.&#13;

*Assumptions of the economic analysis: discount rate=12%; real exchange rate 500 CFAF=US$1; taxes not included.&#13;
**Assumptions of the financial analysis: discount rate=30% (reflecting farmer aversion to risk); values incorporate&#13;
15% tax; economic feasibility of investment packages is a prerequisite to economic feasibility of project as a whole.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
The estimated internal rate of return remains above the 12% opportunity cost of capital if key variables do not vary by&#13;
more than the following:&#13;
Key Variable                                             Sensitivity&#13;
Prices of crops and/or wood                            can tolerate more than 20% decrease&#13;
Labor cost                                             can tolerate more than 30% increase&#13;
Capitalization cost (initial investment                can tolerate more than 30% increase&#13;
Crop and/or wood yields                                can tolerate more than 20% decrease&#13;
Real appreciation in costs                             can tolerate more than 3% real increase&#13;
Real appreciation in prices                            can tolerate more than 3% real decrease&#13;
Nature of Benefits:    Social and productive infrastructure installed and operating at the pays ruraux level, crop&#13;
yields increased substantially. More than 1.2 million people will benefit directly and&#13;
indirectly from greater productivity, improved social services and higher income.&#13;
Main Beneficiaries:    Farm households will benefit from substantially higher crop yields and hence, higher&#13;
incomes. Pays ruraux will benefit from improved social infrastructure such as schools and&#13;
health centers. Consumers will benefit from increased supplies of commodities in the local&#13;
and regional markets. Private sector investments in rural infrastructure that improve basic&#13;
living conditions, including access to schools, health services, and clean water. Private&#13;
entrepreneurs will benefit from at least 1500 small and medium-sized contracts to be&#13;
awarded locally.&#13;
Level of Risk:         Significant&#13;

            Ivory Coast - Rural Land Management and
            Community Infrastructure Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Rural Land Management and Community
            Infrastructure Development Project will help create the
            conditions needed to raise the standard of living of Cote d
            Ivoire's rural population. Its specific objectives will
            be to: (1) facilitate land tenure security on over 2 million
            hectares of rural land; (2) strengthen local capacity to
            plan, make decisions, govern and manage affairs at the local
            level; and (3) support small-scale investments for
            sustainable natural resources management, sustainable
            agriculture, and infrastructure development to be undertaken
            collaboratively by the government and local communities. The
            project will include four components: (1) Clarifying land
            tenure surveying, mapping and land tenure clarification so
            as to certify land rights, facilitate conflict resolution,
            and help identify land management and development options;
            (2) Enhancing local management capacity- assisting
            communities to participatorily develop local development
            plans (LDP) outlining what is needed to sustainably manage
            agricultural, pasture, and forest land as well as associated
            water resources, and to develop and maintain village and
            inter-village infrastructure, strengthening rural communes,
            community organizations, and interested groups to facilitate
            self-governance and local management, and to maintain newly
            created infrastructure and income-earning assets; (3)
            Financing local investments- financing to enhance community
            investment capacity and to implement LDPs;   and (4)
            Supporting decentralization, and coordinating the project
            and the environmental mitigation plan.
