A MARKET-BASED APPROACH TO CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT: HOW&#13;
UGANDA'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE BREAKING NEW GROUND&#13;
By Mark Nelson, World Bank Institute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   For many developing countries, capacity development means donor-sponsored training programs and&#13;
   outside experts. But a noteworthy example in Uganda shows that capacity development may work bet-&#13;
   ter and be more sustainable when local market forces are unleashed to provide for local capacity needs.&#13;
   The Uganda case spotlights an approach supported by the World Bank and other partners that has&#13;
   focused on improving the capacities of Uganda's local governments, which since the 1990s have been&#13;
   part of one of Africa's most ambitious decentralization processes. In that program, Uganda's Ministry&#13;
   of Local Government has used World Bank and other donor financing to create a set of incentives aimed&#13;
   at improving the performance of the country's local governments. Part of the approach was not only a&#13;
   system to reward high-performing local governments, but actions aimed at stimulating both supply and&#13;
   demand for capacity development at the local level.&#13;

            A market-based approach to capacity
            development : how Uganda's local governments are
            breaking new ground
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            For many developing countries, capacity
            development means donor-sponsored training programs and
            outside experts. But a noteworthy example in Uganda shows
            that capacity development may work better and be more
            sustainable when local market forces are unleashed to
            provide for local capacity needs. The Uganda case spotlights
            an approach supported by the World Bank and other partners
            that has focused on improving the capacities of
            Uganda's local governments, which since the 1990s have
            been part of one of Africa's most ambitious
            decentralization processes. In that program, Uganda's
            ministry of local government has used World Bank and other
            donor financing to create a set of incentives aimed at
            improving the performance of the country's local
            governments. Part of the approach was not only a system to
            reward high-performing local governments, but actions aimed
            at stimulating both supply and demand for capacity
            development at the local level.
