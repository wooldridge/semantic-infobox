        <abstracts>
            Hatton National Bank is the largest
            private commercial bank in Sri Lanka and one of the handful
            of commercial banks in the world that have initiated
            microfinance programs. The bank launched its program in 1989
            as an integral part of its operations, motivated by two
            business objectives. First, the program aims to protect the
            bank s market share from state-owned rural banks and nonbank
            microfinance institutions such as credit cooperatives,
            especially in rural and semiurban areas, where more than 75
            percent of the country s population lives. Second, the
            program is an investment in the future: it targets
            microfinance clients with the potential to grow into small
            enterprises in the formal sector. This Note profiles Hatton
            National Bank's microfinance operations, highlighting
            two questions: How does a privately owned bank downscale
            part of its operations for microfinance? Is microfinance
            consistent with profit orientation?
