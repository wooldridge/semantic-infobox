ANNEX 1&#13;
Description of the Multi-Donor Umbrella Facility for Capacity Development&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all agreements entered into&#13;
between the Bank and entities (collectively, the "Donors") that provide contributions (the&#13;
aggregate of all contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to be administered by the&#13;
Bank for the Trust Fund.&#13;
A.     DESCRIPTION&#13;
1.     The objective of the Trust Fund is to scale-up the reach and impact of the World Bank&#13;
Institute's (WBI) strategy and its key areas which focus on capacity development and cut across&#13;
WBI's clusters of services and business lines.&#13;
2.     WBI's approach under its new strategy leverages World Bank's programs by catalyzing&#13;
change for stronger development results through strengthening the capacity of government and&#13;
non-government change agents to collectively solve pressing development challenges. WBI's&#13;
approach has been structured around three interlinked clusters that are aligned to the Open&#13;
Development agenda for the World Bank: (a) Open Knowledge; (b) Collaborative Governance;&#13;
and (c) Innovative Solutions. Under each cluster, WBI has developed new business lines, which&#13;
include but are not limited to:&#13;
(a)    Open Knowledge promotes open, practical and accessible knowledge sharing through&#13;
practitioner knowledge exchanges, e-learning and face-to-face courses.&#13;
i)     Structured Learning. The e-Institute is the World Bank's virtual learning&#13;
platform. The e-institute leverages innovative advances in information and&#13;
communication technology to deliver high-quality and customized learning that&#13;
can be accessed by development stakeholders.&#13;
ii)    Knowledge Exchange. WBI provides support to client countries and the World&#13;
Bank's operations teams with the tools that facilitate peer-to-peer knowledge&#13;
exchanges among developing countries.&#13;
(b)    Collaborative Governance promotes collaborative leadership and multi-stakeholder&#13;
action for more inclusive and sustainable development results.&#13;
(i)    Government Transparency and Geo-mapping. WBI maps government data,&#13;
including social infrastructures, government's budgets, and IFC, MIGA and&#13;
World Bank project locations.&#13;
(ii)   Non-Governmental Actors' Capacity. WBI works with diverse stakeholders&#13;
such as governments, civil society, media, the private sector, and parliaments to&#13;
strengthen public accountability to help citizens receive better services.&#13;
(iii)  Citizen Engagement through ICT. WBI works with a variety of development&#13;
stakeholders to promote mechanisms that connect citizens to public service&#13;
providers and policy makers, and that provide feedback on the quality of public&#13;
services and the effectiveness of donor-funded programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-5-&#13;
(iv)   Multi-Stakeholder  Governance. WBI facilitates   collaboration  among&#13;
stakeholders and networks by designing and delivering a structured multiyear&#13;
capacity-building process that fosters a commitment to collective innovation and&#13;
collaborative action for positive change.&#13;
(c)    Innovative Solutions advances new development solutions through innovation platforms&#13;
or competitions.&#13;
(i)    Competitions and Challenges. WBI leverages the global reach of new and&#13;
innovative solutions to key development challenges using technologies, tools,&#13;
methods and online platforms.&#13;
(ii)   WBI Innovation Lab. WBI scales-up innovations across the Bank including&#13;
identifying cutting-edge innovations, developing an "innovation portfolio"&#13;
aligned with World Bank strategic priorities.&#13;
B.     ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURES&#13;
The Contributions may be used to finance expenditures that are eligible under the Bank's&#13;
applicable policies, procedures, and under the Administrative Manual.&#13;

1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1.   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth&#13;
in this Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary&#13;
