The Governance, Regulation and Finance Division of WBI (WBIRP) conducted a core course on&#13;
Privatization and Regulation of Transport Services in Washington, D.C., from September 20-26, 1998.&#13;
This was the second course offering in 1998, following an earlier course offering in January, 1998. The&#13;
primary objective of the course was to provide transport regulators and policy makers with theoretical and&#13;
practical tools necessary to deal with various challenges that arise after privatization of the transport&#13;
sector. The course covered four major themes: 1) theories of regulation in industries; 2) international&#13;
experiences in the liberalization and privatization of transport activities; 3) information required for day-to-&#13;
day operations in implementing regulations; and 4) institutional requirements for effective regulation.&#13;
Participants in the course included Ministers and Secretaries of Transport, and heads of privatization&#13;
commissions and regulatory agencies. A total of 41 participants, including 9 (22.0%) women, attended&#13;
this course from 16 countries.&#13;
&#13;
The WBI Evaluation Unit (WBIES) conducted a Level 1 (participants' reaction) evaluation using a&#13;
participant's feedback questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 40 respondents, 97.6% of the&#13;
total participants. Respondents were asked to give their views about course content, the quality of&#13;
instructors, and perceived levels of their own knowledge on 6 specific issues, before and after the&#13;
course. A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1 = minimum to 5 = maximum was used for each&#13;
question. Respondents were also asked to write comments or suggestions for the course in an open-&#13;
ended format. Following are the key evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Course Design and Delivery&#13;
&#13;
    ·   The overall usefulness of the course received a mean score of 4.35 out of 5.0. Nearly 95% of&#13;
        respondents rated either 4 or 5 on the 5-point scale for this indicator, suggesting a high level of&#13;
        satisfaction with the course.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   The quality of the 8 course instructors was assessed individually in terms of their knowledge of&#13;
        issues and communication skills. Two of the 8 instructors were the presenters of case studies. All&#13;
        instructors received a rating exceeding 4.0 on their knowledge, ranging from 4.08 to 4.74. Three&#13;
        instructors, including the 2 case study presenters, also received an above-4.0 rating in their&#13;
        communication skills, ranging 4.29-4.82. Five of the 8 course instructors scored in the 3.62-3.94&#13;
        range.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   The course used a combination of lectures and case studies to deliver key messages. The&#13;
        course organizer particularly emphasized the use of case studies in the initial course plan as an&#13;
        important means to promote interactions among participants and facilitate active exchange of&#13;
        different experiences by participants. The extent to which respondents were satisfied with the&#13;
        quality of different pedagogical methods used during the course, however, was not captured in&#13;
        the questionnaire. In addition to the quality of instructors' knowledge and communication skills,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       for the future it would be critical to measure other various specific dimensions of instructional&#13;
       delivery in assessing course performance, such as the usefulness of each instructional method,&#13;
       the level of interactions between participants and instructors, the depth of material coverage, and&#13;
       the appropriateness or balance of time allocation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Self-Reported Knowledge&#13;
&#13;
   ·   Respondents' pre/post self-assessment of their knowledge levels indicated a positive gain on all&#13;
       6 specific topics. Pre-course ratings were below 3.0 across all topics, ranging from 2.49 to 2.97.&#13;
       Four of the 6 items exceeded a rating of 4.0 after the course, ranging 4.03-4.33, and 2 items&#13;
       received a rating in the high 3.0 range, 3.79 and 3.98.&#13;
&#13;
   ·   The mean score of the topic on "contractual arrangements in infrastructure deals" increased from&#13;
       2.68 to 4.13, indicating the largest pre/post percentage change (54.2%). The "role of return and&#13;
       price cap regulation," with which respondents indicated the least familiarity before the course&#13;
       (mean=2.49), was also one of the items that increased substantially in rating after the course&#13;
       (mean=3.79, or 52.6%). Respondents' pre/post gain was above 50% on all topics, except on one&#13;
       item. The topic on "quality regulation" had the highest pre-course rating among the respondents&#13;
       (mean=2.97), indicating that the respondents were most familiar with this item before entering&#13;
       the course. Respondents reported that their knowledge level remained among the highest on this&#13;
       topic at the end of the course (mean=4.21), but their perceived gain from attending the course&#13;
       was the smallest among all topics (41.4%).&#13;
&#13;
   ·   One of the expectations of the course organizer was that participants who attended the course&#13;
       would be able to increase their "problem-solving" skills. The questionnaire had 2 questions that&#13;
       asked about respondents' skills: the extent to which respondents acquired new regulatory skills;&#13;
       and the extent to which they understood the next steps to take for their own plans. Respondents&#13;
       had a rating exceeding 4.0 on both questions, 4.03 and 4.24, respectively. It was not clear,&#13;
       however, whether or how much respondents' problem-solving skills were improved by taking the&#13;
       course. The questions only asked about their skill levels at the end of the course, and their initial&#13;
       levels upon entering the course were not measured. The course organizer is advised to compare&#13;
       participants' perceived technical skill levels both before and after the course, or more preferably,&#13;
       use a measure other than self-reported instrument to try to assess actual gains in skills and&#13;
       learning in future course offerings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Comments from Respondents&#13;
&#13;
   ·   Written comments from respondents showed both positive feedback and suggestions for future&#13;
       courses. When asked about the most useful aspect of the course, the most common responses&#13;
       were the presentations of case studies and exchange of views and experiences among&#13;
       participants (N=17), improvement in understanding general framework of privatization and&#13;
       regulation (N=7), reading materials provided by the course and references for useful documents&#13;
       (N=6), and exposure to negotiation skills (N=5).&#13;
&#13;
   ·   Respondents felt that the course could be improved in a number of ways. Ten respondents&#13;
       commented on the balance between the number of topics covered in the course and the&#13;
       limitation of time. They requested that the course should be selective in topics and ensure&#13;
       sufficient time to review each of the important issues in depth. Another 8 respondents preferred a&#13;
       longer duration for the course, such as a 2-week session, to cover all scheduled topics. Several&#13;
       respondents commented on case studies (N=5), requesting more case presentations covering&#13;
       different regions, as well as various modes of transport, such as rail and ports. They also&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
suggested that each case study be supplemented by a clear identification of lessons learned.&#13;
Several respondents also commented that the course should have more group work or role-&#13;
playing activities for negotiation skills (N=5), and that each presentation should be followed by&#13;
participants' discussions (N=4).&#13;

            The Governance, Regulation and Finance
            Division of World Bank Institute (WBIRP) conducted a core
            course on privatization and regulation of transport services
            in Washington, D.C., from September 20-26, 1998. This was
            the second course offering in 1998, following an earlier
            course offering in January, 1998. The primary objective of
            the course was to provide transport regulators and policy
            makers with theoretical and practical tools necessary to
            deal with various challenges that arise after privatization
            of the transport sector. The course covered four major
            themes: 1) theories of regulation in industries; 2)

            and secretaries of transport, and heads of privatization
            commissions and regulatory agencies. A total of 41
            participants, including 9 (22.0 percent) women, attended
            this course from 16 countries.
