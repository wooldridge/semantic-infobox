&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]1&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . from early on in the . .&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Since 1968.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: â&#128;&#153;68, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Late â&#128;&#153;68. I joined the group in the government.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did you come from the university also?&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Yes, well, I came from University of Pittsburgh. I just . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: From Pittsburgh!&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, Iâ&#128;&#153;m from Princeton, you know.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Oh, Princeton. Well, I earned my doctorate degree, you know, in&#13;
Pittsburgh. It was 1968. And right away I went home and joined, you know, National&#13;
Planning Office chaired by Professor Widjojo [Nitisastro] at the time, so I assumed the&#13;
responsibility as the deputy chairman in charge of fiscal and monetary plans from â&#128;&#153;68&#13;
until â&#128;&#153;73.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They popped you right into the deputy chairmanship.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Then â&#128;&#152;73 until â&#128;&#153;83 I was responsible forâ&#128;&#148;vice chairman, you know, I was&#13;
appointed vice chairman of the planning office.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Or vice president of Professor Widjojo and concurrently minister of state&#13;
for administrative reform. That means, you know, trying to improve the performance of&#13;
government bureaucracy. Then â&#128;&#153;83 until â&#128;&#153;88 I was the chairman, minister of planning&#13;
and chairman of the planning office, replacing, you know, Professor Widjojo. Then&#13;
March â&#128;&#153;88 until now Iâ&#128;&#153;m here. So Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been, well, close to 20 years in the planning&#13;
office.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes. And you joined the government just the same year that the World Bank&#13;
started up here.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Right, right, yes, yes, yes. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s why Iâ&#128;&#153;m, well, I still remember vividly,&#13;
well, our association with the World Bank because itâ&#128;&#153;s long enough. So at the planning&#13;
1&#13;
    Side A is interview with Kemal Siber.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Johannes B. Sumarlin&#13;
                                  November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
office, instrumentally, of course, we had to work together or we, you know, get close,&#13;
you know, cooperation with the World Bank, especially when Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell&#13;
started there.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Bernie Bell started out here, yes, yes, yes. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve all met with Kemal Siber&#13;
this morning, and I stayed on longer. We had a fine talk. He was here when Bernie&#13;
arrived with [Robert S.] McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Yes, exactly. He was here, well, as a rep officer, representative of . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Of the [International Monetary] Fund.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: IMF, of the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Well, we worked together, how to streamline, how to take care of our&#13;
monetary, you know, affairs at the time. So, well, it was very helpful, you know,&#13;
working with Siber, as well as with Bernie Bell, of course.&#13;
&#13;
So thatâ&#128;&#153;s why in--I remember the key success of our work with the World Bank has been&#13;
the quality of the local people, the rep office of the World Bank in Jakarta.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Really.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Oh, yes, yes. With Bernie Bell wasâ&#128;&#148;you know, itâ&#128;&#153;s veryâ&#128;&#148;well, we&#13;
enjoyed very much working with Bernie Bell. It was very helpful indeed in moving our&#13;
project ahead. In 1968-69, for instance, when none of us in the bureaucracy knew how to&#13;
prepare a project, a project, you know, good for World Bank consideration--only, I think,&#13;
in 19â&#128;&#148;letâ&#128;&#153;s seeâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#153;70, yes, in â&#128;&#152;70 we taught our people how to prepare the projects, at the&#13;
same time World Bank provided us the technical system: how to prepare the project,&#13;
good project, so that is qualified for World Bank financing. Something like that. And we&#13;
learned a lot.&#13;
&#13;
We used to have a very frank and open dialogue with the World Bank, with the IMF,&#13;
with AID [U.S. Agency for International Development] , because we knew at the time,&#13;
you know, we need their support. We need their support. Letâ&#128;&#153;s have a dialogue, a frank&#13;
dialogue with the, you know, people like World Bank, you know, Bernie Bell from&#13;
World Bank and others, at the time also from AID. It was very important to us.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You had a fellow named Stokes Tolbert here.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Stokes Tolbert, yes, I knew him, yes. Later then he joined World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Johannes B. Sumarlin&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Yeah, I knew him fairly well, too. Stokes Tolbert. Tall.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Tall, tall, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
I gather that in a way the policies that the Bank and that you have been sort of jointly&#13;
pursuing have been, have a certain common pretty steady thread that goes all the way&#13;
through it. Itâ&#128;&#153;s always aâ&#128;&#148;youâ&#128;&#153;re interested, certainly, in growth but with stability, that&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#153;s a very strong emphasis on one might say conservative finance. Is that right? I&#13;
mean, youâ&#128;&#153;re concerned to avoid inflation . .&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . to avoid excessive deficits, either internal or external, and this has been a&#13;
pretty constant . .&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Right, theme. Right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Itâ&#128;&#153;s just gone from one finance minister or one coordinating minister to&#13;
another, not much of a shift in that?&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Yes. We stick to that kind of theme, yes, yes, yes, we adopted that kind&#13;
of theme because, well, because we learned last year, and in 1950 until â&#128;&#152;65 at the time&#13;
was inflation very high and reachedâ&#128;&#148;I mean, the climate in 1965 and our inflation was&#13;
650% per annum.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: 650 percent in 1965.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Yeah. And practically between â&#128;&#152;62 and â&#128;&#153;65 there was no growth at all.&#13;
What you had then is negative growth. So learning from that experience, and mostly we&#13;
commonly adopted the policy ofâ&#128;&#148;we call it growth with stability. So since then weâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
consciously pursued that policy. And it happenedâ&#128;&#148;thatâ&#128;&#153;s the thing also compatible with,&#13;
you know, World Bank, IMF ideas. But we deliberately adopted that policy, that&#13;
strategy, growth with stability and equity. Oh, yeah. Today we call it three logi of our&#13;
development, you know, objectives of growth, stability and equity.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And how did youâ&#128;&#148;what parts of the program were focused on equity&#13;
particularly?&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s primarily, you know, well, development in the agriculture sector,&#13;
because 70, 80% of people at that time lived in the rural areas. If you can improve their&#13;
life, you know, through farming and others, that means direct or indirectly improve their&#13;
lives, their . . .&#13;
&#13;
So most ofâ&#128;&#148;I donâ&#128;&#153;t know--World Bank assistance weâ&#128;&#153;ve concentrated on improving&#13;
agriculture business sector, building infrastructures, improving our schools quality, so&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#153;s mostly direction of the World Bank assistance or other assistances.&#13;
&#13;
                               Johannes B. Sumarlin&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Was the Bank reinforcing that emphasis right from the beginning? Do you&#13;
remember what the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s priorities were for sectors?&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Agriculture was a priority, I think, because . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Really. â&#128;&#153;68, â&#128;&#153;69?&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: â&#128;&#153;60, â&#128;&#153;69, â&#128;&#153;70, and then, yeah, still. Irrigation, improve harbors&#13;
[inaudible] and infrastructure, you know: port development, road networks. We--but in&#13;
the â&#128;&#153;70s we began to receive World Bank financing to build a rural road network. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
also very important, connecting, you know, where the product [inaudible] connecting the&#13;
producing sector with the urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The Bank didnâ&#128;&#153;t finance the road projects â&#128;&#152;til â&#128;&#153;75, I think.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Yeah, the rural road network, yes. I think they start to finance in â&#128;&#153;65.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s rather a long time, â&#128;&#153;68 to â&#128;&#153;75, that you were not putting very high&#13;
priority on roads.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Well, because the rural roads network at that time primarily we rely upon&#13;
our local financing. We call it the INPRES [Instruksi Presiden, Presidential Instruction] ,&#13;
the INPRES [inaudible] Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what we refer to, good program and very successful,&#13;
Javanese. So . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The World Bank probably wasnâ&#128;&#153;t doing much local cost financing early on,&#13;
was it?&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Well, mostly they concentrated on the irrigation, big irrigation projects.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Foreign exchange costs.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Foreign exchange costs, well, yes, but not so much on that.&#13;
&#13;
But so the irrigation projects were mostly as a Bank project and take, well, years to&#13;
complete, yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What was your concern? I mean, you had a plan and projects.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Was it really the Bank deciding where, which projects they would finance or&#13;
you were saying, â&#128;&#156;You finance thisâ&#128;&#157;?&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Well, we decide . .&#13;
&#13;
                              Johannes B. Sumarlin&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You decide.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: . . the project and we put it in our Five Year Development Plan. Then, of&#13;
course, before we prepare a plan, of course, you know, we received also a lot of inputs&#13;
from the World Bank, [Russell J.] Cheetham and other experts, from, you know, our&#13;
people in [inaudible] , and from other people, from [inaudible], you know, people, you&#13;
know, well, from other countries, mostly at the time Dutch. Also we received Canadian&#13;
people, Japan and others. Based on this input we prepare a Five Year Development Plan.&#13;
There we decide our plan. So basically the projects we decide ourselves, not instructed&#13;
or, you know, [inaudible] focus on the others. So this is the way, but the way we prepare&#13;
our plan, of course, based on various inputs, from within, from our own people, and from&#13;
others, but once we put it in our plan, it is our plan.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And the Bank was fairly flexible in financing the projects that you wanted them&#13;
to finance?&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Oh, yes. So far so good, you know. Well, but theyâ&#128;&#148;actually, it depends&#13;
on our people also, you know. What happens, you can convince them, and the World&#13;
Bank, they are responsive to our, you know, our requests or our thinking, but as long as&#13;
we have a good people, I mean good representative people of the World Bank in Jakarta,&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#153;s no problem.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Let me go back to this business about poverty and agriculture. At the time that&#13;
you were really getting going here in the early â&#128;&#152;70s is when McNamara also was focusing&#13;
very heavily on poverty and on the smallholder agriculture, pushing, the Bank was sort of&#13;
leaning very hard in that direction. Did thatâ&#128;&#148;did you go along with that kind of line here&#13;
or . .&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: This was our own program.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Your own program. I see.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Oh, yes, yes, yes. And itâ&#128;&#153;s compatible with McNamara ideas. Like&#13;
transmigration: thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way we solve our poverty problem on Java. You know, we&#13;
move out landless people from Java to outer islands, to Sumatra, and there these people&#13;
receive a quarter hectare of land. So this is the way we, you know, we deal at the time&#13;
with poverty problem. In the meantime, when people are leaving Java, you know, we can&#13;
consolidate our land on Java also.&#13;
&#13;
So transmigration also is one of our programs. We try to not only redistribute our&#13;
populace. Java is the most densely populated area in this country. This is maybeâ&#128;&#148;how&#13;
many percent at the time?--80% of the total population live in Java. One solution&#13;
[inaudible] moving out the people and give them jobs, give them land outside Java and in&#13;
the meantime improve the irrigation area in Java also. And we built also irrigation&#13;
outside Java so that, you know, the people, the farmers, coming from Jamati can continue&#13;
&#13;
                              Johannes B. Sumarlin&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
their, you know, their farming, wet farming.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is that continuing, the transmigration?&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Oh yes, oh yes. Continue until now. Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is the Bank still supporting that?&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: I think in the last, letâ&#128;&#153;s see, three or--three years, three years, I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
rememberâ&#128;&#148;maybe not now but, you know, maybe three years before this, because when&#13;
I left BAPPENAS [Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional, National Development&#13;
Planning Board] I left planning, but still, well, financing from the World Bank, still, you&#13;
know, loans from the Bank financed this.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Professor Widjojo had sort of asked us to raise two issues with you which he&#13;
said you would know best. One was, he said--two topics, one was the resolution of the&#13;
debt in the late â&#128;&#152;60s, that whole sort of episode. The other was he felt that you might&#13;
have some . .&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: You mean foreign debt.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Our foreign debt.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. How that was resolved and the way--he said you would have a . .&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Well, our debt was resolved in 1970 when, you know, we agree on the&#13;
Paris talks.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Youâ&#128;&#153;re talking about late, werenâ&#128;&#153;t you? Or are you talking about the early&#13;
one?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay. Excuse me, sir.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: The early one. That means, you know, we reschedule our old debt, you&#13;
know, along the Paris, you know, agreement in 1970. But based on then we can really&#13;
take a breath, you know, so because the debt had to be rescheduled on 25 yearsâ&#128;&#148;25&#13;
years? Until â&#128;&#153;85, fifteen years, something like that. Well, based on that, then we can&#13;
enjoy the, you know, the discipline of foreign loans. And it was always our strategy in&#13;
committing new debt that new debt should be a soft one, concessional, and that means the&#13;
interest if possible should be zero after that and the repayment should be as long as&#13;
possible. And we get that kind of financing in early â&#128;&#152;70s from the IGGI [Inter-&#13;
Governmental Group for Indonesia] funds; thatâ&#128;&#153;s fifty years. AID and U.S. assistance&#13;
&#13;
                              Johannes B. Sumarlin&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
was forty years, interest of zero, only three quarters of one percent. So Japan, the interest&#13;
to them maximum was two percent for thirty years.&#13;
&#13;
But once our economy, you know, began to mature and then began to grow, well, starting&#13;
in 1976, then we received less concession. [inaudible] Instead we embark upon looking&#13;
for semi-concessional funds. There we started to build our satellite through export&#13;
trading facilities. It was 1976. But since then I think the amount of assistance of World&#13;
Bank I think is still increasing all the time. Up until to now I think we receivedâ&#128;&#148;letâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
see--1.5 billion dollars, something like that . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: 1.6.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: 1.6 billion, yes, yeah. We started very low at the time, in 1970s.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The debt resolution at that time was fairly exceptional.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What sort of led to such an exceptional . . .&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Oh, well, you know, we hired an expert from Switzerland, Dr. [Hermann&#13;
J.] Abs.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been speaking with Dr. Abs. I just received his book today, this&#13;
morning, that he wrote about, you know, his experience dealing with German debt at the&#13;
time, in 1952.&#13;
&#13;
So based on his formula, then, we come to the Paris Club, and we receive agreement, I&#13;
mean thereâ&#128;&#153;s agreement that we can, you know, reschedule our old debt for fifteen years,&#13;
something like that. And then we start to, well, to look for new debt, a new borrowing,&#13;
new loans, and this had to be concessional because our economy at that time was still,&#13;
you know, very, well, very low and we need to [inaudible] our agricultural sector,&#13;
something like that. We need, you know, very concessional, and we managed to have that&#13;
kind of financing. So . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Iâ&#128;&#153;m afraid weâ&#128;&#153;ve used up our ration of time. Well, sir, itâ&#128;&#153;s very good of you to&#13;
see us for this length of time, and we will try to digest all that weâ&#128;&#153;ve been picking up&#13;
from you and your colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
Thereâ&#128;&#153;ll be nothing to show for it for some time. This book of ours is not going to come&#13;
out until 1994.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Oh, I see, still, you know, three years to go.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Itâ&#128;&#153;s a long time, yes, but itâ&#128;&#153;s a lot of work to do.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Well, I think the World Bank is veryâ&#128;&#147;are you going to see our colleague&#13;
Mr. [Ali] Wardhana?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, this afternoon later.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Oh, good. And then you can have, you know, well, more information or,&#13;
well, information because if you listen to me, maybe Iâ&#128;&#153;m biased. Yes, maybe Iâ&#128;&#153;m biased.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Weâ&#128;&#153;re all biased.&#13;
&#13;
SUMARLIN: Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been too long at the planning office.&#13;
