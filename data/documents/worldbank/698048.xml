        <abstracts>
            Almost all direct World Bank's
            support for microenterprises is delivered through loans
            aimed at reducing poverty. A review of the microenterprise
            programs shows that although they involve only very small
            amounts, the effort by the Bank's staff to make them
            work has been enormous. This large up-front effort will pay
            off only if these small initiatives are understood as pilot
            programs from which to draw lessons for future programs that
            can reach large numbers of people. Thus, they should be
            monitored carefully and ineffective approaches quickly
            discarded. This Note reviews the design of the Bank's
            microenterprise loans and describes lessons learned. The
            review raised four key design questions: 1) Is the strategy
            of promoting and supporting microenterprise development a
            sound approach to poverty reduction generally and to
            employment creation among the poor specifically? 2) Are
            these components packaged correctly for the Bank to roll
            microenterprise support programs into poverty reduction
            operations? 3) Are the institutional arrangements used in
            these operations well-suited to achieving the objectives? 4)
            Are the terms and conditions of credit provision in these
            components in line with international best practice in
            micro-credit delivery? The Note concludes that the financial
            support for microenterprises in Bank projects is limited,
            and suggests options for growing the portfolio.
