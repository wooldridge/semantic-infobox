                          Clark, William D.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Robert Asher, on 1983-10-05&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     William Clark, a British national, was appointed Director of&#13;
Information and Public Affairs by both Presidents Woods and McNamara&#13;
in April 1968. From 1974 until his retirement in 1980 he served as&#13;
Vice President, External Relations. Prior to that, Clark had been&#13;
working together with Woods, as Director of the Overseas Development&#13;
Institute (ODI) in London, on a number of topics including the idea of&#13;
setting up a "Grand Assize" to revive aid efforts to the developing&#13;
world. He had also served as Press AttachÃ© at the British Embassy in&#13;
Washington during the post-war years and as Press Secretary to the&#13;
Prime Minister of Great Britain, Anthony Eden (1955-56).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Clark discusses the high priority task of working closely with&#13;
McNamara, details of the field trips as he travelled with him; whereby&#13;
the knowledge he brought of the Third World and of the personalities&#13;
was instrumental, and, most notably, the trips to Africa as the&#13;
beginning of McNamara's poverty program. Drafting McNamara's first&#13;
speech, considered crucial with its strong reference to population as&#13;
one of the restraints on development, and his involvement in drafting&#13;
subsequent speeches--a task subsequently relegated to his old&#13;
draftsman from the Pentagon, Jack Maddux. His early morning meetings&#13;
with McNamara covering broad issues and strategies, as well as&#13;
problems of the Board and the likely reactions to some proposals.&#13;
Clark covers his second priority as head of External Relations,&#13;
involving primarily the Bank's (McNamara's) rapport with the United&#13;
Nations, specifically, the Administrative Committee on Coordination&#13;
(ACC).&#13;
&amp;#12;        Clark covers McNamara's relations with various key people in the&#13;
Bank such as Burke Knapp one of his senior vice president and, outside&#13;
the Bank, such as Barbara Ward, Maurice Strong and David Rockefeller,&#13;
and their influence on McNamara. McNamara's intense relationship with&#13;
Bank staff member Mahbub ul Haq, especially vis-Ã&#128;-vis the US Congress,&#13;
and his strong preference to handling himself the part of public&#13;
relations impinging on the American scene. In Clark's evaluation of&#13;
McNamara he talks candidly of his strengths and weaknesses, and of his&#13;
contribution to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Clark discusses the specific facets of his responsibilities in&#13;
public relations, dealing with the press, ensuring the publication of&#13;
McNamara's speeches, publishing the sector papers and thus opening the&#13;
floodgates to a vast quantity of Bank publications on various aspects&#13;
of development, and his efforts in turning the Bank's Publications&#13;
Office into an important development center and a source of&#13;
information on all aspects of development. As Clark's efforts in&#13;
facilitating relations externally were dominated by dealing with the&#13;
US Congress, he gives his own impressions of the peculiarities and&#13;
idiosyncrasies of the US Government with its understanding of the Bank&#13;
and its culture, and, in return, the prevailing sentiment amongst non-&#13;
American Executive Directors in light of this, and his dealings with&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Clark talks of his involvement with the Economic Development&#13;
Institute (EDI) and the importance of its function in making countries&#13;
self-sustaining and able to carry on their own development, the Bank's&#13;
contribution in the environment field and his advice to set up an&#13;
environmental group in the Bank in 1968, and setting up the&#13;
Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) in&#13;
May '71.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Clark concludes with the following: "We are a world institution,&#13;
and the world depends on the World Bank more than it knows." And, "I&#13;
&amp;#12;just hope that we can soon find ourselves restored to an increasing&#13;
capacity to act in the interests of all of mankind."&#13;
