        <abstracts>
            In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the
            England and Wales power supply industry underwent the most
            radical transformation ever experienced by such an industry,
            swiftly evolving from a state-owned, state-controlled,
            integrated structure to a privately owned, autonomously
            regulated, unbundled structure. The authors discusses the
            lessons for reformers in developing countries.
