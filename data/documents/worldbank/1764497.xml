broaden the tax base. Thus developing coun-&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Recent World Bank analysis shows that
            taxes on petroleum products are a critical source of
            government revenue for low-income countries. And if the
            experience of industrial countries serves as any guide, the
            rates of these taxes will have to rise sharply as low-income
            economies develop. But policymakers must be mindful of how
            taxes (and subsides) affect the relative prices of fuels,
            since too large a difference in process between products cab
            lead to fuel switching and adulteration, adversely affecting
            the government tax take and pollution levels.
