Foreword&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Water is a basic need for human live and must be available in adequate and sufficient quantity and quality, as mandated in Law 7/2004&#13;
on water resources. To ensure that water needs are met, provision of water supply is regulated in Government Regulation 16/2005&#13;
on Development of Water Supply Systems. The objective of water supply development is in line with the target of the Millennium&#13;
Development Goal (MDG) for water supply sub sector, which is to increase a national safe access for water to 68.87% by 2015, and to&#13;
65.81% in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
The target of MDG for water supply in rural areas is a significant challenge for Indonesia, because of the uneven distribution of its&#13;
population and the poverty of its rural population. Number of poor in rural areas reaches as much as 65% of 35 million poor people in&#13;
Indonesia. Currently, the safe access for water in rural areas is 45.72%, then requires an increase of 20.09% to achieve the target.&#13;
&#13;
Government has worked hard to increase the safe access to water in rural areas reaches as, involving local communities in the planning,&#13;
development and post project management processes. Large-scale investment projects to support development of water supply infrastructure&#13;
in rural areas, such as WSSLIC and Pamsimas, are managed by communities through water user associations.&#13;
&#13;
This organization has become an effective forum to manage and deliver sustainable development outcomes in rural drinking water&#13;
infrastructure. Experience in community-based development indicates a positive result, such as increasing the sense of ownership of the&#13;
project and reducing the project costs.&#13;
&#13;
However, the performance of water user associations in the post construction period is largely determined by their managers and the&#13;
participation of the community.&#13;
&#13;
In order to achieve the positive results in management of drinking water as a community-based learning for stakeholders and communities,&#13;
then herewith is drafted a handbook for Community-Based Water Supply Organization. It is intended as a reference of best practices in&#13;
operating water supply system in rural areas by water user associations for the associations itself and also for local government.&#13;
&#13;
This handbook describes the important aspects in the operation and maintenance and management of the system in good performance,&#13;
which might encourage the development of new investment in community water supply systems. Each chapter presents instruments that&#13;
aim to help users to implement the concepts. These concepts include institutional frameworks for water supply provision, regulatory&#13;
requirements to establish a water supply service organization, the organizational structure and management systems of water user&#13;
associations, the components of small-scale piped water supply systems, basic operation and maintenance, recording system and financial&#13;
reporting for water supply management associations, and preparation of investment development plans.&#13;
&#13;
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who worked in the preparation of this book. I hope that it is useful and gives a&#13;
significant contribution to provide guidance for enhancing competency-based and community drinking water management to meet water&#13;
needs for the poor in the rural areas and creating a more prosperous Indonesian society.&#13;

   The first stage involved conducting a survey of community capacity and the number of                         to be adequately addressed â&#128;&#147; firstly through&#13;
   households that could be served. The results of the survey concluded that the community                      measures defined in the service contract&#13;
   should be divided into three economic strata: Class A - households with an above average                     between customers and service providers&#13;
   capacity (15%); Class B â&#128;&#147; households with the capacity to meet extra needs (10%); and Class                  and ultimately, through the courts of law.&#13;
   C â&#128;&#147; households that were only able to make ends meet and had no extra capacity (75%).                        Importantly, customers also have a right to&#13;

   This purpose of this classification was to identify those who were able (class A) to subsidize               services.&#13;
   those who were less well off (class C), and those who were just able to meet their own needs&#13;
   (class B). The calculations showed that the cost of constructing an installation and reservoir&#13;

   to supply 1,000 users would be IDR 1 billion. This translates as an average payment of&#13;
   IDR 1,000,000 by each user, with Class A users paying IDR 3,000,000, Class B users IDR                       obligation to pay for the service according&#13;
   1,000,000, and Class C users IDR 500,000.                                                                    to the established tariff policy and use the&#13;
                                                                                                                water supply judiciously. Customers have&#13;
   By adopting this cross-subsidy approach, the community members support each other                            to do their part in maintaining the water&#13;
   by sharing the cost fairly. The services are still running quite well, but the (new) village                 facilities in good working condition and to&#13;

Box 2: Where Can CBOs Go to for Assistance?&#13;
&#13;
  Managing and operating a water supply system is no small task. It requires a high degree of skills, hard work and patience â&#128;&#147; and it helps if they have&#13;
  institutions that they can turn to for support. Local governments and non-government organizations are the most common sources of support for CBOs.&#13;
&#13;
  BANDUNG DISTRICT GOVERNMENT RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
  Conscious of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s limited ability to provide infrastructure, including rural water supply facilities, an appropriate strategy is needed for the&#13;
  efficient provision of water supply, particularly in rural areas. One method is adopting a community empowerment approach throughout the project&#13;
  cycle, which involves:&#13;
&#13;
    1.   Increasing public participation&#13;
    2.   Forming Village Water Supply Management Groups (Kelompok Pengelola Penyediaan Air Bersih Desa - KPPABD)&#13;
    3.   Regular monitoring and evaluation&#13;
    4.   Facilitating communities to construct facilities&#13;
&#13;
  To ensure optimal construction of the facilities, from verification process through the proposal passing the local development planning screening process,&#13;
  villagers have formed village water supply management groups to propose water supply programs.&#13;
&#13;
  The village water supply management groups are involved in each development step, including planning, construction and maintenance. They are&#13;
  involved by the contractors building the facilities, during the construction and maintenance phases. Management of the facilities built by the contractor&#13;
  (not the assets) is handed over to the village administration, which delegates their management to the village water supply management group.&#13;
&#13;
  By involving the village water supply management groups in every stage, the community, through the village water supply management group, should&#13;
  have a sense of ownership of the built infrastructure and gain experience in technical aspects of village water supply and the village water supply network.&#13;
&#13;
  Today, 201 village water supply management groups in 276 villages/wards in Bandung District have been formed and trained. The training and education&#13;
  program for the village water supply management groups is continuing.&#13;
&#13;
  Some groups that have been able to apply what they have learned from the training grow into healthy village water supply management groups that are&#13;
  able to build facilities, increase the number of users, and even have savings for rehabilitation and make contributions to village funds. All this, along with&#13;
  good service and competent technical, financial and organizational management, have resulted in satisfied customers.&#13;

  Yayasan PESAT (Ms. Helen Lok)&#13;
&#13;
  The Pesat Foundation is committed to supporting communities by providing water supply systems based on the capacity of the community. The&#13;
  foundation builds equal partnerships with communities to jointly manage water supply systems through water supply management boards.&#13;
&#13;
  The foundation bases its programs on detailed observations that explore all local potentials to ensure that each system meets the needs of the whole&#13;
  community. To this end, the foundation focuses on the institutional strengthening of water supply management boards to ensure the durability of the&#13;
  physical infrastructure of the water supply system. This institutional strengthening takes the form of training in good management, administration, and&#13;
  financial practices, and technical training in water supply development.&#13;
&#13;
  Local communities now have water supply, although the management of the systems is not quite as planned and expected. The lessons learned from this&#13;
  experience are that communities are able to run water supply management boards as community forums, and that communities have much to offer to&#13;
  ensure the smooth running and sustainability of water supply programs. Support from others always helps towards developing water supply management&#13;
  boards so that local communities have a reliable water supply system managed by the community itself.&#13;

                                         In general, there are three basic requirements to be eligible to operate a water supply system&#13;
                                         in partnership with the local government. They are: the organization must be a legal entity;&#13;
 Chapter 4                               it must have license to operate a water supply system; and, since the water supply provider&#13;
                                         is likely going to need to take water from natural sources, it will need a permit to extract&#13;

   service organization:                 CBOs have been operating for many years on an informal basis. Why would CBOs&#13;
   o Formation of a legal entity         consider formalizing and following regulations instead of going on as usual? Formality&#13;
   o License to operate a water          brings a level of security to CBOs â&#128;&#147; by following the laws, CBOs should expect protection&#13;
      supply system                      from it including benefiting from rights to property and use (e.g. water permits confer to&#13;
   o Water extraction permit             CBOs the right to extract and use water), due process, limiting the personal liability of&#13;

   requirements       to      continue   operate without disturbance. Compliance demonstrates to the public that a CBO is worthy&#13;
   operating as a water supply           of trust and acts responsibly, and therefore, should be given a degree of independence to&#13;
   provider                              operate continuously. Formality also opens up more doors for the CBOs to deal with&#13;
                                         other businesses and support agencies, such as a bank, investors and other development/&#13;
 Available Tools:                        government entities that have mandates to support micro- and small-businesses.&#13;
                                         Importantly, CBO formality gives the community enterprise recognition as a professional.&#13;

   Performance Monitoring                Based on regulations issued by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW Regulation 18/&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Sample License to Operate             PRT/M/2007) to implement Law No. 7/2004 and GR 16/2005, communities need to&#13;
                                         manage water supply systems through a legal entity. A legal entity is a group of persons&#13;
                                         organized through the formalities specified under the law and in this way is considered&#13;
                                         under the law as a single â&#128;&#152;juridicalâ&#128;&#153; person.&#13;
&#13;
                                         The regulation identifies a number of forms of organizations that are allowed to manage&#13;
                                         water supply. Community groups can form a private enterprise, either for-profit such&#13;
                                         as a limited liability company or not-for-profit, such as a foundation. Community&#13;
                                         groups can also be organized as a cooperative, which is a communally-owned organization&#13;
                                         established to pursue a common interest (in this case, the provision of water supply). If the&#13;
                                         provision of water supply was intended to be limited to community members, they can also&#13;
                                         form into an association, of which there are various kinds: usersâ&#128;&#153; associations (Himpunan&#13;
                                         Kelompok Pemakai Air Masyarakat), community deliberation boards (Badan Musyawarah&#13;
                                         Masyarakat) community self-help groups (Kelompok Swadaya Masyarakat), and usersâ&#128;&#153; and&#13;
                                         operatorsâ&#128;&#153; groups (Kelompok Pemanfaat dan Pemelihara). It must be emphasized that&#13;
                                         under GR 16/2005, a usersâ&#128;&#153; association is only allowed to serve its community members.&#13;
                                         Thus, if the aim of the group is to supply water to those outside the community, it should&#13;
                                         consider forming a limited liability company, foundation or cooperative.&#13;

4.2. Must Have a License to Operate&#13;
&#13;
CBOs must obtain a license to operate from the local government. The law speaks of competitive tender as the means in which third parties&#13;
are brought on board to assist BUMDs in providing water supply. There is little guidance at present, however, on how local governments&#13;
must license providers who supply to communities outside the reach of such BUMDs.&#13;
&#13;
Typically, licensing is an administrative procedure where the competence and capability of an entity to perform a public service is assessed,&#13;
and the authority to carry out such public service is delegated within specific terms and conditions. Becoming licensed is a privilege, rather&#13;
than a right â&#128;&#147; i.e., government has the authority to refuse to license an entity for just causes and given due process. Part of the license review&#13;
process may include a public hearing to allow other parties to comment on the decision to grant a license.&#13;
&#13;
A license will generally contain the following matters:&#13;

the CBOs. The public has a large interest&#13;
to make sure that the CBO operates viably&#13;
and efficiently, because otherwise, they&#13;
cannot meet the needs of the community.&#13;
In many ways, the success of a CBO is a&#13;
positive thing for the community. For&#13;
example, if the CBO is not able to cover&#13;
the costs of running the system, then it will&#13;
not be able to operate for long. This means&#13;
the members of the community will have to&#13;
make other arrangements to getting water,&#13;
such as fetching or buying from another&#13;
source.&#13;
&#13;
As CBOs mature, they may sometimes&#13;
become focused on â&#128;&#152;running the business,â&#128;&#153;&#13;
while members of community take the role&#13;
of â&#128;&#152;customers.â&#128;&#153; CBOs having originated&#13;
from the efforts of the community, managers&#13;
will do well to exploit this strong bond to&#13;
continue to foster mutual understanding&#13;
and support. A process for regular review,&#13;
reporting and feedback to the community&#13;
on the performance of CBOs can provide&#13;
the foundation for continuing improvement&#13;
of and support to CBOs.&#13;

                                         The succeeding chapters of this toolkit will provide guidance to a number of these processes.&#13;
                                         What is worth noting at this stage is the fact that although they are small organizations,&#13;
                                         CBOs need to consider a number of complex processes to continue to function effectively.&#13;
&#13;
                                         These processes may not have been apparent at the time CBOs were formed. But as CBOs&#13;
                                         move forward, the ability to consider and implement these processes becoming increasingly&#13;

                                         manifestations, but can be guided by formal policies and systems. It is important that&#13;
                                         CBOs agree on the values that will guide their practices and encourage desirable practices&#13;

Box 4: It Pays to Have Strong Community Participation&#13;
 Name                     :   Sumber Maron Water Supply and Sanitation Management Board&#13;
 Location                 :   Karangsuko Village, Pagelaran Subdistrict, Malang District&#13;
 Established              :   2005, began operations in 2006&#13;
 Current Connections      :   990 households in 4 villages in 2 subdistricts.&#13;
&#13;
 Many factors motivate communities to establish water supply and sanitation management boards, including:&#13;
 1. Abundant potential water sources but no modern system to improve peopleâ&#128;&#153;s access to water supply&#13;
 2. A high incidence of water-related diseases (diarrhea and skin infections)&#13;
 3. Social problems (disputes between villagers or between villagers and the village administration) arising from disagreements over the use of irrigation water for&#13;
    bathing, washing and personal hygiene&#13;
 4. The price of water (IDR 1,500/50 liters), which only the well-off can afford&#13;
&#13;
 To develop a water supply system that brings water to peopleâ&#128;&#153;s homes, the community must, among other things:&#13;
 1. Take an active role in all pre program meetings about the program&#13;
 2. Make cash contributions (IDR 11,750,000)&#13;
 3. Make in-kind contributions (IDR 56,500,00)&#13;
 4. Pay for the household connections&#13;
&#13;
 Initial hurdles in setting up a water supply and sanitation management board include:&#13;
 1. Interference from rogue village officials&#13;
 2. Lack of conviction on the part of some community members&#13;
&#13;
 Steps to overcome these hurdles include:&#13;
 1. Providing a continual flow of information about the development&#13;
 2. Strengthening information centers (local shops, meeting places, etc) as dissemination media&#13;
 3. Approaching community leaders, religious leaders and youth leaders&#13;
 4. Discussing and agreeing on matters&#13;
 5. Ensuring transparency in the financial management of the organization (by providing all stakeholders access to financial reports)&#13;
&#13;
 We have learned that it is important to:&#13;
 1. Have discussions and make agreements&#13;
 2. Involve everyone (those for and against)&#13;
 3. Involve women, and&#13;
 4. Have transparency in financial management&#13;

 You will need   1.   Thompson Weir â&#128;&#147; A weir is an overflow structure installed perpendicular to the channel or flow of water.&#13;
                      The weir has an opening in the middle (with known dimensions) cut on its top edge. This opening is called&#13;
                      a â&#128;&#152;notchâ&#128;&#153; and the bottom edge of the notch is the â&#128;&#152;crestâ&#128;&#153; of the weir. A Thompson Weir has a V-shaped&#13;
                      notch. (Figure 1)&#13;
&#13;
                      A weir acts like a â&#128;&#152;damâ&#128;&#153; and causes water level to increase upstream of it. The level of water above the crest&#13;
                      of the weir is called the â&#128;&#152;headâ&#128;&#153; (h) â&#128;&#147; See Figure 2. This level of water needs to be measured at a specified&#13;
                      distance upstream. Ideally, it is 4 times the â&#128;&#152;headâ&#128;&#153; (depth of water flow above the crest) (See Figure 3).&#13;
&#13;
                 2.   Table of Thompson Weir â&#128;&#147; The table converts the â&#128;&#152;headâ&#128;&#153; into flow rate using a formula.&#13;
&#13;
 Steps           1.   Set the weir in the part of the channel or river that is straight (not meandering) and be sure that there are no&#13;
                      upstream obstructions.&#13;
                 2.   Measure the â&#128;&#152;headâ&#128;&#153; in centimeters (See Figure 3) by driving a gauge into the channel upstream from the&#13;
                      weir.&#13;
                 3.   Use the table to convert the head into flow rate.&#13;

 Prospecting,         Prospecting is a study of how water occurs within ground formations to understand their distribution and quality.&#13;
 Resistivity and      These tests are conducted to determine how much water can be safely taken from a well for use in the water supply&#13;
 Pumping Test         system. If there are already several wells in the area, or if the aim is to develop the ground water for a large area,&#13;
                      drilling and aquifer pumping may be required to investigate the effects of pumping on the yield of other wells in&#13;
                      the vicinity and on the aquifer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 You will need        1.   Any information available about the area such as maps and reports of known boundaries, soils and geological&#13;
                           formations, topographical information, data on hydrology and meteorology.&#13;
                      2.   Site diagram with the location of the well to be tested (test well), and other nearby wells that may be affected&#13;
                           by the pumping (observation wells); well-logs (i.e. records of rates of drawing water); information on the&#13;
                           depth and construction of the neighboring wells; information on water quality and yield of wells.&#13;
                      3.   Expert inputs are necessary. Based on knowledge about how water exists in the specific ground formations&#13;
                           in the area, an experienced hydrogeologist may be able to define sources for water supply systems and their&#13;
                           characteristics.&#13;
                      4.   With special geo-resistivity equipment, experts may also be able to conduct electrical resistivity tests to&#13;
                           establish the characteristics of the water table such as depth, quality and aquifer distribution.&#13;
                      5.   In pumping tests, a special test well has to be developed and the quality of test well construction can affect&#13;
                           the results. Special instruments are also needed to take measurements. Experts, such as a hydrologist, will&#13;
                           also be needed to interpret the information.&#13;
 Description          Resistivity measures how well electricity is conducted through the ground (with varying layers of formation).&#13;
                      The resistivity values are then compared to an existing well of which the hydrological information are known, to&#13;
                      establish the geological conditions underground.&#13;
&#13;
                      The pumping test is undertaken by pumping a test well at a constant rate (similar rate to the proposed debit) for&#13;
                      a period, usually at least 24 hours, and observing the rate of discharge, change in water level in the test well and&#13;
                      change in water level in observations wells (such as neighboring wells that may be affected by the pumping of the&#13;
                      test well).&#13;

For each size of pipe (indicated in the upper row), follow the column down to the value closest to the slope (indicated on the table as S).&#13;
In our example, the slope was 1.14. Then, follow the table to the left most column to the rate of flow (Q). In our manual calculation, Q&#13;
= 0.18 liters/second.&#13;

Example 2: In the same example, given a daily maximum flow rate (Q) requirement of 1.05 l/s for the water supply system, what diameter&#13;
pipe would the transmission need? Transposing the formula above, the formula for diameter is:&#13;
                                                                                                                                                      0.38&#13;

Using the data in the formula, we calculate that the ideal pipe diameter is 49 mm, or about 2 inches.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                         0.38&#13;

                                                    49 mm =           [                                                                         ]&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The same answer can be derived using the prepared table. This time, start on the left most column to find the desired rate of flow (Q).&#13;
In this example, the maximum daily required flow is 1.05 l/s, which is approximately in between the encircled values (1.00 and 1.10).&#13;
Follow the rows to the left to find the closest values to the slope (earlier calculated as 1.14). Then, follow the columns upward to find the&#13;
pipe diameter.&#13;

&#13;
                                         The proper operations and maintenance of the different parts of the water supply system&#13;
                                         can go a long way to ensuring that the community continues to enjoy the benefits of clean&#13;

   Provides guidance for the operation   properly done. For example, if the intake is not cleaned regularly and broken pipe screens&#13;
   and maintenance of                    are not replaced, the quality of water is likely to suffer. Pipe bursts are often â&#128;&#152;repairedâ&#128;&#153; by&#13;

   Available Tools:                      Besides the skills to operate and maintain the different parts of the system, the CBO&#13;
                                         needs to have on hand appropriate tools and enough supplies to do replacements or&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Troubleshooting                     repairs. It is, therefore, important that the water users are paying the appropriate tariffs&#13;
                                         so that the CBO has access to funds to undertake regular operations, maintenance and&#13;
                                         repairs.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Sometimes, even though proper maintenance is conducted, repairs can become more&#13;
                                         costly than expected, for example, in case of flooding or earthquakes where the facilities&#13;
                                         are damaged. It may be a good idea for the CBO to set aside an â&#128;&#152;emergency fundâ&#128;&#153; from&#13;
                                         small amounts of moneys collected regularly as part of the usersâ&#128;&#153; fees/tariffs. Without&#13;
                                         accumulating small amounts of money throughout a long period of time, the usual&#13;
                                         problem becomes that when an emergency happens, the CBO only starts collecting&#13;
                                         money from the community at that point. Often, the requirements are too large that&#13;
                                         the community contribution for that time will not be enough. In a representative survey&#13;
                                         conducted by the project of 1000 water user respondents, the majority of users agree to&#13;
                                         contribute regularly towards an emergency fund.&#13;

 ï&#130;·ï&#128;  Water   is not transparent due to       ï&#130;·ï&#128;    Daily cleaning of screen; draining and flushing of sediments as necessary, or if sludge reaches 10 cm&#13;
     sediments                                   from the bottom&#13;
 ï&#130;·ï&#128;  Clogging of the inlet/outlet pipes      ï&#130;·ï&#128;    Plant growth may be clogging the pipes. Inspect the intake and remove growing plants&#13;
 ï&#130;·ï&#128;  Cracks in the intake building           ï&#130;·ï&#128;    Inspect the cracks. If there are leaks, repairs are necessary to close up the holes. Otherwise, repainting&#13;
                                                 with sealing paint/plaster will do&#13;
&#13;
                                                 Repainting is necessary at least once a year, even without cracks to preserve the building&#13;
 ï&#130;·ï&#128;  Fluctuation of water quantity           ï&#130;·ï&#128;    Frequent measurement of the water level will alert the CBOs of permanent water issues that need to&#13;
                                                 be addressed by structural solutions (e.g. additional reservoir) or increasing water debit&#13;

Box 5: Solving Problems Together&#13;
 Sumber Apak water supply and sanitation management board in Jambearjo village in the Tajinan subdistrict of Malang district was established on 6 May&#13;
 2005 at a plenary village meeting. Although not yet a legal entity, Sumber Apak now (as of June 2010) has 1,010 household connections in Jambearjo&#13;
 village, Tajinan subdistrict and in Bululawang village, Bululawang subdistrict, Malang.&#13;
&#13;
 The water supply system we manage uses a pump and gravitation system (the water is pumped to a tank and then distributed to consumers by gravity),&#13;
 and all household connections have water meters. The people responsible for operating the system are appointed by the community, who also inform&#13;
 them of any problems with the system.&#13;
&#13;
 Although we have not had any problems with our water source, we have had problems with frequent, unexpected outages of electricity, which is&#13;
 supplied by the state-owned electricity utility PLN. This interferes with our water supply, because our pumps are not automatic (because of the distance&#13;
 involved, we cannot use a water level control between the well and collection tank). So our technical team has to take a note of when the pump is on&#13;
 and when it is off, so that we can calculate the additional water production needed for when it does go off unexpectedly. We have had very few problems&#13;
 with the collection tank and the pipes, other than someone who did not know where the pipe was, digging a hole and accidentally breaking the pipe&#13;
 (although the pipe was correctly installed). We dealt with this by mending the pipe.&#13;
&#13;
 When repairs or maintenance are too difficult for us, we consult the water supply and sanitation management board association, which has its own&#13;
 technical team, or we consult the supplier. We are still getting advice from district government about organizational matters.&#13;
&#13;
 The lessons we have learned are that everyone has skills, even villagers; one must search for information and use it; there must be a written procedure&#13;
 for every activity so that whoever is on duty can carry out whatever tasks needed to be done; and donâ&#128;&#153;t make matters worse trying to do things that you&#13;
 canâ&#128;&#153;t do â&#128;&#147; donâ&#128;&#153;t be afraid ask for help, even from someone younger than you are â&#128;&#147; work together with everyone in a professional manner for the sake&#13;
 of our water supply and sanitation system.&#13;

It is a good idea to write down the operation and maintenance procedures for deep wells and display them close to the facility, such as&#13;
inside the pump house.&#13;

Table 25: Financial Deï¬?nition and Terms Used&#13;
 Term                          Definition&#13;
 Accounts Payable              Accounts Payable are routine expenses that have already been incurred but not yet paid. The fact that the expense has&#13;
                               been â&#128;&#152;incurredâ&#128;&#153; is evidenced by the supplierâ&#128;&#153;s invoice or statement of account.&#13;
 Accounts Receivable           Accounts Receivable represents the balance of water bills not yet collected from customers.&#13;
&#13;
                               This is entered as a Current Asset.&#13;
 Accounts Summary              The Accounts Summary is a worksheet where all accounts of the water utility from the Bills for Collection Report,&#13;
                               Cash Receipts Book and Cash Disbursements Book are posted. This worksheet also allows for special adjusting entries.&#13;
                               The Balance Sheet and Income Statement are prepared based on this Accounts Summary.&#13;
 Accrued Expenses              Accrued Expenses are routine expense that have already been incurred but not yet paid and unlike the â&#128;&#152;Accounts&#13;
                               Payableâ&#128;&#153; have not been recorded in the financial statement for the period because no invoice or statement of account&#13;
                               has yet been received.&#13;
 Accumulated Depreciation      In common use, â&#128;&#152;depreciationâ&#128;&#153; is the reduction in value of a fixed asset due to wear and tear and passage of time.&#13;
&#13;
                               Using this principle, in accounting, the cost of a fixed asset is usually spread over the number of years that the asset can&#13;
                               be used (useful life). The cost attributed for one year is called â&#128;&#152;depreciation.â&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
                               Accumulated Depreciation refers to the sum of the year-to-year depreciation for the period that the asset has been used.&#13;
&#13;
                               So â&#128;&#152;net asset valueâ&#128;&#153; is the cost of the asset minus â&#128;&#152;Accumulated Depreciation.â&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
                               Accumulated Depreciation is presented in the Balance Sheet as a deduction to â&#128;&#152;Fixed Assets at cost.â&#128;&#153;&#13;
 Administration Fee            The Administration Fee represents a charge imposed on all customers during the specified period for the administration&#13;
                               of the billing and collection of accounts of customers.&#13;
 Advances                      Advances are payments made to either employees or third parties with the intention of collecting them back within&#13;
                               one year.&#13;
&#13;
                               An example would be a cash advance given to the Village Head to help the village decorate for Lebaran. The amount&#13;
                               is expected to be returned by the Village Head when the budget for decorations are available from the Government.&#13;
&#13;
                               This is a Current Asset account.&#13;
 Amortization                  Amortization refers to that portion of a loan that is repaid periodically until the loan is fully paid. This does not&#13;
                               include the interest on the loan.&#13;
 Assets                        Assets are any resource controlled by the CBO to derive benefits. As presented in the Balance Sheet in this Handbook,&#13;
                               assets can be Current Assets or Fixed Assets.&#13;
&#13;
                               Current Assets are cash and other assets that may be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year. Examples&#13;
                               are Accounts Receivable, Advances to Employees, Advances to Third Parties, Merchandise Inventory and Prepaid&#13;
                               Expenses.&#13;
&#13;
                               Fixed Assets are acquired for continued and long-term use in the operations of the CBO. Examples are land, buildings,&#13;
                               pumps, furniture, and vehicles.&#13;

                               following the water bill to ensure completeness. It is summarized monthly and the totals (per account) are posted to&#13;
                               the â&#128;&#152;Accounts Summary Formâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
 Capital                       Capital represents equity contribution of the owners in the CBO as well as donations from government and donors.&#13;

                             the top part of the Income Statement, while net income appears at the bottom after expenses have been deducted from&#13;
                             revenues.&#13;
 Salaries                    Salaries account is the accumulated payment for services of employees of the water utility. It includes all personnel&#13;
                             benefits and allowances attached to their service.&#13;
 Statement of Receipts and   The Statement of Receipts and Disbursements is a financial report that summarizes all types of cash received and all&#13;
 Disbursements               types of cash payments made during a specified period. It accounts how the Cash account moved during the specified&#13;
                             period. The bottom line of this report is the Cash balance available at the end of the period. This amount may not&#13;
                             be the same as the bottom line of the Income Statement which is the Net Income for the period. Cash received may&#13;
                             include collection of water sales and penalties. It may also include collection of advances from employees and third&#13;
                             parties and even collection of loan proceeds. So cash received may either be revenues, a reduction of assets or an&#13;
                             addition to liabilities. Cash payments may include payment of loans, purchase of assets and payment of expenses. So&#13;
                             payments may either be expenses or a reduction of liabilities or an addition to assets.&#13;

                             For example, the General Ledger account â&#128;&#156;Advances to Employeesâ&#128;? is supported by Subsidiary Ledgers for all the&#13;
                             employees that have received cash advances. This makes monitoring of the status of cash advances easier. The sum of&#13;
                             all the Subsidiary Ledgers for a specific account should tally with its General Ledger account at any time.&#13;

5 Depreciation&#13;
&#13;
The cost of fixed assets - whether donated, constructed or purchased - have to be distributed over their useful life. This is what we call&#13;
depreciation. For simplicity of application, we will calculate depreciation as follows:&#13;
&#13;
          Depreciation for the year = acquisition cost estimated useful life&#13;
&#13;
The following data will be needed:&#13;
&#13;
 Data                                 Description&#13;
 a. Asset type                        The asset types common to water utilities are listed in the List of Fixed Assets and Depreciation&#13;
                                      below.&#13;
 b. Date acquired                     This date is used in determining if the asset is subject to depreciation for the current period or if it&#13;
                                      is already fully depreciated.&#13;
 c. Acquisition cost                  This is the sum of all costs incurred in putting the asset to use.&#13;
 d. Additions this month              This column is for the acquisition cost of assets acquired during the period. A line may be&#13;
                                      inserted to group the newly acquired asset with the same asset type.&#13;
 e. Total acquisition cost            This is the sum of the acquisition cost column and the additions this month column (columns c&#13;
                                      and d).&#13;
 f. Useful life (in years)            There are standards to the useful lives of assets. We can use those recommended by Kantor Pajak&#13;
                                      and what is being used by Pedoman Akuntansi PDAM.&#13;
 g. Depreciation per year             The annual depreciation is calculated by dividing the total acquisition cost by the useful life of the&#13;
                                      asset.&#13;
 h. Depreciation per month            This is calculated by dividing depreciation per year by 12 months.&#13;
                                      This is the depreciation expense that is one of the monthly adjustments to the financial&#13;
                                      statements.&#13;
&#13;
Depreciation can be calculated from the table below.&#13;

                                           In many cases, the first time ever that CBOs were formed were through government&#13;
                                           projects where the investment for the water supply infrastructure was mostly granted. In&#13;
 Chapter 8                                 the course of their operations, CBOs are able to generate surplus income after operational&#13;

                                           Unlike large water supply systems such as those operated by the local water utility, CBOs&#13;
                                           system expansion depends mostly on the capacity of the operator to manage the system,&#13;
                                           availability of demand and capital to expand the system (assuming the source of water is&#13;
                                           not a constraint).&#13;
&#13;
                                           Not different from the initial project construction, expansion planning should begin&#13;
                                           with the calculation of how many more customers need to be served to check against the&#13;
                                           present idle capacity in the system, and to decide whether capacity needs to be increased.&#13;
                                           For accurate measurement of volume of demand, the average current consumption per&#13;
                                           connection can be used as a basis to calculate the total additional capacity needed for the&#13;
                                           expansion.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Having calculated the additional volume of water to be produced, an assessment of each&#13;
                                           system component needs to be done to see whether the current infrastructure (pump and&#13;
                                           reservoir capacity, diameter of transmission pipe, etc) are still able to deliver the water at&#13;
                                           this additional flow rate or some components need to be upgraded. This assessment will&#13;
                                           indicate what new infrastructure components need to be constructed or upgraded and&#13;
                                           becomes the basis of the investment design.&#13;

Box 6: What Is 1 m3?&#13;
 In the MVP experience, most households served by CBOs consume between 10 to 15 m3 of water in a month. If the calculated tariff is&#13;
 IDR 2,000/m3, this means that a household will be paying between IDR 20,000 â&#128;&#147; 30,000 per month. In discussing whether this water&#13;
 tariff is affordable to the members of the community, one constraint is that people may not have a reference point for making a decision.&#13;
 For example, people may not be able to visualize how much is 1 m3 of water?&#13;
&#13;
 Community facilitators and CBO staff might find this visual helpful. It shows a domestic storage unit with the size of 1m3 and compares&#13;
 this with the volume and price of bottled water. The picture also shows that a pack of cigarettes costs more than three times a cubic&#13;
 meter of water from the CBO. So for 3-4 packs of cigarettes each month, a family could easily pay for the monthly household water&#13;
 bill of IDR 20,000-30,000. Suddenly, the tariffs seem much more affordable considering the importance of water for the whole family&#13;
 to survive and enjoy their lives.&#13;

 Name             : Tirta Sawargi Water Supply and Sanitation Management Board&#13;
                    Panenjoan Village, Cicalengka Subdistrict, Bandung District&#13;
 Established      : 1999&#13;
 No. of customers : + 250 household connections (current)&#13;
&#13;
 Panenjoan village received support from the provincial government to develop a pipe network, but only a few people benefited and the&#13;
 quality of the water was poor. So the village administration and community leaders decided to try working in partnership with an NGO&#13;
 that was involved in water supply (on the recommendation of Mr. Wedana) to improve the system. A committee was formed to take&#13;
 responsibility for the development. The community financed the development of the water supply system itself, with start-up capital&#13;
 initially provided by the NGO and the actual construction being done by the community under the coordination of the committee&#13;
 and with the support of the NGO. Once the water supply system was delivering water to people in their homes, they gradually repaid&#13;
 the NGO the capital invested. As well as paying the development cost in installments (IDR 500,000/household over + 40 months),&#13;
 customers also pay water usage fees, which are managed by the committee. In the management phase, the committee became a water&#13;
 supply management board.&#13;
&#13;
 The system has been running for +10 years, and during that time the biggest problems were rising electricity costs, fluctuating electrical&#13;
 voltage, frequent damage to the submersible pumps, and theft of electric cable. As a result, routine operating costs and repair costs&#13;
 soared, and the management board ran out of funds. When donations from the community proved insufficient to pay for repairs,&#13;
 the management board sought loans from various sources, including the bank, using securities belonging to the board members as&#13;
 collateral. Our dream is to replace the pump system with a gravitation system that uses treated river (irrigation) water or water from a&#13;
 spring in another village that is at a higher elevation.&#13;

contractor needs to be revisited.&#13;
&#13;
b. Progress Supervision&#13;
The three keywords in supervising the&#13;
progress of implementation (construction)&#13;
are: quality, time, and budget. The&#13;
Technical Drawing is a tool that can&#13;
be used to assess the consistency of the&#13;
construction against the design. There is no&#13;
question that the contractor has to follow&#13;
the technical drawing fully. Any minor&#13;
change on the design during construction&#13;
has to be redone, or if the CBO agrees&#13;
to the modifications, then the technical&#13;
drawing has to be revised and signed by&#13;
the CBO, prior the modification. The&#13;
Technical Specification is also a tool used to&#13;
monitor the construction quality, especially&#13;
its consistency with the agreed materials&#13;
as mentioned in the document. Technical&#13;
Specification can mention several options&#13;
on the materials for item components as&#13;
long as those materials are in the same class,&#13;
for example: types of ceramics, woods, etc.&#13;
These options are useful whenever certain&#13;
materials are not available in the market.            equal to 0.21% of the total project cost     ï&#130;·ï&#128;  Then, by adding up (cumulatively) the&#13;
                                                      (IDR 407,574,000).                              distributed weights from Week 1 into&#13;
In relation to time and budget supervision                                                            Week 2 into Week 3 and so on, the&#13;
                                                   ï&#130;·ï&#128;  Based on the number of weeks required&#13;
methods, the â&#128;&#152;S-Curveâ&#128;&#153; can be applied to                                                              cumulative total will equal to 100% at&#13;
                                                      to undertake each task, distribute the          the end of the project period. This gives&#13;
observe how the budget disbursement to&#13;
                                                      â&#128;&#152;weightâ&#128;&#153; calculated for each item. This         you an idea that by Week 1, 0.18% of&#13;
the project is in line with the progress of&#13;
                                                      is called the â&#128;&#152;distributed weight.â&#128;&#153; For         the work is planned to be completed;&#13;
physical works. The steps in developing the&#13;
                                                      example, the total weight of item 1 is          by the end of Week 5, 15.5% of the&#13;
S-Curve are:&#13;
                                                      0.21% and the total number of weeks it          work is planned to be completed; by&#13;
  ï&#130;·ï&#128;  Develop a table similar to the one in            takes is 2 weeks. So, each week for item        Week 8, 29.4% of the work is planned&#13;
     the example below, with the tasks on             1 has a distributed weight equivalent to        to be completed and so on until the&#13;
     the first column and the time period in          0.105% (in the example, it appears as           Last Week of the project where 100%&#13;
     weeks in the next succeeding columns.            0.1% due to rounding).                          of the work will be completed.&#13;
&#13;
  ï&#130;·ï&#128;  Convert the budget for each â&#128;&#152;taskâ&#128;&#153; as         ï&#130;·ï&#128;  After identifying the â&#128;&#152;distributed           ï&#130;·ï&#128;  If you plotted those cumulative&#13;
                                                                                                      percentages (going from the bottom to&#13;
     a portion of the total construction by           weightâ&#128;&#153; for each week of each item of&#13;
                                                                                                      the top) across the weeks (going from&#13;
     dividing the amount of this component            work, add the â&#128;&#152;distributed weightsâ&#128;&#153; of&#13;
                                                                                                      left to right) with a point after each&#13;
     of work by the total construction                all items for each period (at the bottom)       week, you are able to draw a curved line&#13;

c. Commissioning&#13;
Commissioning is a process following construction to check and verify whether all the system components are working properly. Normally,&#13;
the commissioning period is agreed upon (between 3-6 months of operation). If any system component does not work within this period&#13;
(due to construction flaws or damages), the responsibility to repair the flaws lies with the contractor. During the commissioning period,&#13;
it is important for the CBO to observe whether the flow rate and pressure at all points of the system are according to the design.&#13;

            Multi-Village Pooling Project in Indonesia
            : handbook for community-based water supply organizations
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The book discusses basic concepts on key
            topics to managing a small piped water system ideally for up
            to 1,000 households. It presents tools that can be adapted
            by Community-Based Water Organizations (CBOs) for use in
            their operations, such as forms, checklists and procedural
            guidelines. Illustrative examples have also been compiled
            from the experiences of the district local governments,
            support organizations and CBOs operating in East and West
            Java, who participated in the Multi-Village Pooling (MVP)
            Project. This toolkit seeks to compile a set of ready
            resources for organizations supporting Indonesian CBOs and
            CBOs themselves, which was not previously available despite
            many years of rural water investment projects. The book
            introduces fundamental concepts in an easy to-understand
            way, so that a number of discussions have been simplified.
            This will give users a basic understanding enough to seek
            further resources or references or advice from experts,
            which is encouraged.
