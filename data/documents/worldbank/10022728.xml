Evidence-Based Recommendations&#13;
This Field Note describes a study of the performance and sustainability of eight major rural water supply&#13;
projects undertaken in the Philippines over the last decade. The lessons learned from the study include&#13;
the importance of community involvement, local government capacity building, cost recovery, and&#13;
targeting the poor.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     Eight major rural water supply projects were initiated in the 1990s, using&#13;
     various new financing and implementation approaches for rural water supply.&#13;
     This new generation of projects tried to secure commitment and sustainability&#13;
     by requiring stakeholder contributions.&#13;

            Lessons learned from rural water supply
            projects in the Philippines : identifying elements of sustainability
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A flood of aid during the international
            decade for water supply and sanitation (1980-89) failed to
            provide universal access to safe water for all Filipinos. At
            the end of the decade less than 5 percent of the planned
            systems remained in operation, forcing national attention on
            the issue of service sustainability. In response, a new
            generation of rural water supply projects emerged during the
            1990s. These included eight major donor-funded projects that
            experimented with new approaches to financing and
            implementation. In 2003 a study by the Water Supply and
            Sanitation Performance Enhancement Project (WPEP) assessed
            the sustainability and performance of these projects.
            Overall, the findings of the study suggest that projects
            with significant investments in capacity and institution
            building produced the most sustainable rural water supply
            systems. It also showed unequivocally that the involvement
            of the local government and communities aids the
            preparation, planning, implementation, and management of
            such systems, and that sustainability is improved when these
            processes are monitored by external agencies. The study
            suggests that the success of projects will require
            strengthening local capacity and building institutions to
            operate and maintain systems, developing mechanisms for cost
            recovery, explicitly targeting the needs of the poor, and
            providing more incentives for local investment.
