TRANSPORT SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
1.    Chapter I presents the country background to place the proposed project in the context of past&#13;
and current economic adjustment. Chapter II presents the transport sector issues. Chapter III presents&#13;
the reform program prepared by the Government, as of end-1994, to address these issues. Chapter IV&#13;
proposes a strategy for IDA assistance to the transport sector in Cameroon based on lessons learned&#13;
from Bank Group involvement in Cameroon. Chapter V provides the project description.&#13;
I. Country Background&#13;
Economic Background&#13;
2.    Cameroon is among the countries with the greatest development potential in the region. Until&#13;
1985, its economic growth averaged 7 percent per year sustained by abundant natural resources&#13;
(tropical forests, petroleum, bauxite, natural gas, fertile agricultural land, and a largely favorable&#13;
climate). Agriculture was the main source of growth and foreign exchange earnings until 1978, when&#13;
oil production began and became the corner stone of economic growth.&#13;
3.    The favorable economic indicators, and the sudden flow of oil revenues concealed Cameroon's&#13;
mounting structural problems. The traditional growth sectors, particularly agriculture, were neglected&#13;
and their productivity declined. The multitude of public enterprises (PEs) created during this period&#13;
were inefficient and eventually became bankrupt while draining huge resources from the State budget.&#13;
The banking sector practiced imprudent lending by becoming overly dependent on oil revenues and&#13;
large Government deposits. The investment in public infrastructure was not selected to respond to&#13;
priority or social needs and was not followed by proper maintenance. The long-term debt increased&#13;
from less than 20 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1976 to about 50 percent in 1992.&#13;
4.    In addition to the structural problems, Cameroon suffered from two major shocks. Firstly, as a&#13;
result of a sharp decline in export prices by petroleum in 1986, followed by cocoa and coffee, the external&#13;
terms of trade fell by more than 55 percent from 1985 to 1989. Secondly, the real effective exchange rate&#13;
(REER) started to appreciate following the US dollar and Nigerian Naira depreciation in 1985-1986, and&#13;
continued as Cameroon's inflation rate consistently remained above those of its main trading partniers. It is&#13;
estimated that the REER appreciated by more than 40 percent from 1985 to 1989. Real GDP fell by an&#13;
average of 3.4 percent a year from 1986 to 1989, and real per capita income dropped by almost 40 percent&#13;
during the same period.&#13;
5.    In 1988, the Government launched an adjustment program with support of the IMF and the&#13;
World Bank. However, the program was not implemented consistently and its main objectives were&#13;
not attained. While some progress was made in diminishing government intervention in the economy,&#13;
reducing price controls on domestically traded goods, lifting a number of quantitative restrictions on&#13;
imports, and rationalizing the incentives framework, the fundamental structural problems of the&#13;
economy remained unaddressed. As a result, external competitiveness continued to decline, external&#13;
and internal imbalances worsened, and the economic and financial situation did not improve. Tax&#13;
revenues deteriorated while total current expenditures remained unchanged, thus shifting the primary&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
fiscal situation from a surplus in 1989, to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 1992. Key macro-economic&#13;
data are presented in Schedule 1.&#13;
6.     Political uncertainties and weak social indicators aggravate the picture. Attempts to establish a&#13;
national political consensus have thus far failed. The country is now facing major problems of poverty,&#13;
unemployment, illiteracy and population growth. A fourth of the urban population lives below the poverty&#13;
threshold. Unemployment is high among urban women and youth, and has worsened with the contraction&#13;
of the economic activity. In rural areas, poverty and unemployment are rising due to the decline in&#13;
agriculture. Malnutrition is recurrent among rural women and children, especially in the north. Adult&#13;
female illiteracy is high. Health care delivery is poor. High fertility rates and population growth (3.3&#13;
percent per annum), and the scarcity of resources allocated to health and education have worsened&#13;
conditions for the poor.&#13;
Economic Prospects&#13;
7.     A major change occurred on January 1994, when the Government of Cameroon, along with its&#13;
partner countries in the CFA zone, decided to adjust the parity of the CFA Franc from CFAF 50 per&#13;
French Franc (FF) to CFAF 100 per FF. To take advantage of the positive effects of the devaluation,&#13;
the Government, with the assistance of the IMF and IDA, began implementing a program of economic&#13;
measures and structural reforms. The program, supported by an IMF Standby Arrangement (approved&#13;
on March 14, 1994) and an IDA Economic Recovery Credit (ERC, Cr. No. 2627-CM, approved on June&#13;
10, 1994), covers three key areas: (a) redimensioning of the public sector and improved public resource&#13;
management; (b) an improved incentives framework for the productive sectors; and (c) targeted&#13;
poverty alleviating measures.&#13;
8.    In conjunction with the effects of the devaluation, the program is expected to end the recession&#13;
and result in positive real growth, provided it is successful in achieving its objectives. Real GDP&#13;
growth is projected to average about 5 percent per annum from 1995/96 onwards, primarily as a result&#13;
of improved performance in the tradable sector, sustained by increased investment levels as confidence&#13;
is reestablished. Public sector investments are projected to recover gradually from 2.2 percent of GDP&#13;
in 1992/93 to about 4 percent in 1996/97. As a result of reforms of the trade regime, the financial&#13;
system and the public enterprise (PE) sector, and as the public finance situation is brought under&#13;
control, private investment is expected to rise from 8.7 percent of GDP in 1992/93, to about 12-13&#13;
percent in 1996/97. Due to a serious external debt overhang, most of the increase in investments will&#13;
have to be financed by domestic savings, which will need to increase from 9.8 percent of GDP in&#13;
1992/93 to about 20 percent in 1996/97. Private savings will be stimulated by the recovery of&#13;
economic growth and an improved external trade position. Public sector savings are projected to turn&#13;
around substantially, as tax reform and expenditure control translate into improved fiscal balances.&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
9.     The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the medium term was formulated in conjunction&#13;
with the preparation of the ERC. The CAS's objectives are: (a) to redimension, focus, and improve&#13;
the public sector through: (i) a stronger mobilization and more efficient use of public resources, the&#13;
downsizing and reorganization of the civil service, and the divestiture and restructuring of PEs; and (ii)&#13;
improved macroeconomic management in such areas as institutional reforms of the public procurement&#13;
system, environmental protection and the rational use and management of natural resources; (b) to&#13;
increase productive capacity through: (i) reform of the legal and regulatory environment, aimed at&#13;
deregulation and liberalization; (ii) maintenance and development of basic infrastructure; (iii) support&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to human resources development; and (iv) strengthening the financial sector; and (c) to focus&#13;
interventions on poverty alleviation, including improvements in the delivery of social services to low-&#13;
income groups.  To be consistent with the strategy, the lending portfolio, suffering from major&#13;
implementation problems, was restructured in 1993 to focus implementation on immediate priorities&#13;
and to reduce undisbursed IBRD balances. Following the devaluation of the CFA Franc, Bank Group&#13;
financial support to help implement the CAS is on IDA terms.&#13;
10.    The proposed project is consistent with the CAS, and will help achieve its objectives by&#13;
preparing: (a) privatization/liquidation of transport PEs and restructuring sector ministries; (b)&#13;
liberalization of air, urban and maritime transport, and through privatization of road maintenance and&#13;
dredging execution; and (c) the use of labor-based methods in road maintenance.&#13;
Public Enterprise Reform and Private Sector Development&#13;
11.    Since 1989, the Government of Cameroon has implemented reforms to promote private sector&#13;
development. These reforms include: (a) tax and tariff reforms to introduce a value added tax,&#13;
simplify the tariff structure to only four rates, reduce rates, and eliminate exemptions benefiting certain&#13;
goods and companies; (b) trade reform to abolish all remaining quantitative restrictions on merchandise&#13;
imports; and (c) legal reform with the adoption of a new labor code which makes the employer-&#13;
employee relationship more flexible, as well as a new investment code.&#13;
12.    The current institutional framework for privatization proved inoperative during the previous&#13;
PE  reform  initiated under the first Structural Adjustment Program  (SAP).   Laws related to&#13;
privatization are too numerous, of varying authority, and often both overlapping and conflicting. An&#13;
Interministerial Committee, consisting of about 13 Ministers, chooses the enterprise to be privatized,&#13;
the method of privatization, the sale price, the buyer, and follows up on the privatization. The large&#13;
number of ministers in the Committee makes it highly politicized and hardly efficient. A Technical&#13;
Commission (the Commission) prepares the evaluation of companies, the issuance of tenders, and&#13;
preliminary negotiations with potential buyers. The final decision is taken by the Head of State, who&#13;
can be involved in the decision-making process at any step of the procedure. The Prime Minister is&#13;
given the authority to define the procedures for privatization and liquidation, but needs approval by the&#13;
Head of State. Moreover, outside the system is the state holding company SNI, which controls many&#13;
state-owned enterprises. The procedures lack transparency. Bidding is more an exception than the&#13;
regular procedure. Bidding outcomes can be modified or a procedure other than bidding can be chosen&#13;
to give preference to civil servants, employees of the enterprise to be privatized or liquidated, or to&#13;
farmers in the case of agricultural enterprises.&#13;
13.   In addition to the unsatisfactory institutional framework, lack of political commitment has&#13;
hindered the implementation of a coherent privatization/liquidation program. The Commission has not&#13;
formulated a comprehensive strategy defining clearly the PEs to be privatized and the ones to remain in&#13;
the State portfolio, and the policy measures necessary to monitor PEs and improve their management.&#13;
Too much focus was placed on rehabilitation, which mainly consisted of financial restructuring, with&#13;
the State taking care of PEs' operational losses and debt through performance contracts, rather than on&#13;
addressing the causes of the losses -- e.g. overstaffing, inefficient management, political interference&#13;
with management. No priority guidelines were established to determine the enterprises to be placed&#13;
under performance contracts. The Commission has not been able to monitor the design and the&#13;
implementation of all these contracts.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14.   As of end-1993, of the first 15 PEs designated in 1990 for privatization, 5 had been privatized,&#13;
5 were in the process of being privatized, 3 had been liquidated, and 2 were on stand-by for&#13;
privatization.  Since 1990, the Interministerial Committee had designated 8 more enterprises for&#13;
privatization, but only 4 operations were underway.  Sixty-four PEs were in different stages of&#13;
liquidation. Of these, 25 were administrative liquidations in which the Government had become&#13;
responsible for the payment of the debt. Six were banks that had been liquidated under the program for&#13;
reforming the banking sector. Thirty-three were in the SNI portfolio and the liquidation was dealt with&#13;
directly by SNI.  One hundred and twenty PEs remained in the State portfolio.  Twenty-five&#13;
performance contracts were signed, and 5 were being negotiated. The Commission had scheduled&#13;
diagnostic studies for 27 PEs, but only three studies had already begun. Of the 120 PEs, only 27 were&#13;
introduced in the Management Information System set up by the Mission to monitor the PE sector.&#13;
15.   The Declaration of Policy adopted by the Government in June 1994, as a condition for Board&#13;
presentation of the ERC, emphasizes the need for State retrenchment from commercial activities. The&#13;
objective for public enterprise reform is to divest all the PEs currently engaged in production as well&#13;
as in commercial activities. The Declaration specifies that the Government should list at least 10 PEs&#13;
every year to be privatized or liquidated. Fifteen enterprises were listed in July 1994. They included&#13;
the national airline, the railways, the urban bus company, the national shipping line, and the national&#13;
freight forwarder. The Government also intends to gradually bring private equity participation into the&#13;
State oil monopoly. To enhance the performance of enterprises not yet undergoing privatization, and&#13;
improve efficiency and transparency, the Government intends to develop private equity participation&#13;
and management contracts.&#13;
16.   To ensure an expeditious, efficient and transparent State divestiture, the Government is&#13;
currently revising the institutional framework for PE Reform as intended in the 1994 Declaration of&#13;
Policy. The Ministry of Economy and Finance has been mandated to implement this reform. In this&#13;
respect, a powerful, autonomous unit would be established within the Ministry. This unit would be&#13;
staffed with a small team of professionals well known for their integrity and experience in business&#13;
management. The revised institutional framework would be established under a proposed Structural&#13;
Adjustment Credit (SAC), under preparation.&#13;
17.   Domestic Debt. The settlement of Government domestic debt is a priority for the economy. A&#13;
substantial amount of the debt service and arrears are simply not paid, causing economic decline&#13;
through serious illiquidity of the banking system, as well as low returns on private investment. Based&#13;
on the preliminary outcomes of an on-going analysis of the domestic debt, the Government domestic&#13;
debt accounts for 75 percent of the total domestic public sector debt, which amounts to about US$4&#13;
billion and accounts for about 45 percent of the external debt, 50 percent of GDP and six times the&#13;
1993-1994 budgetary receipts. The Government and IDA are currently working on the definition of a&#13;
strategy to settle the domestic debt.&#13;
II. Transport Sector Issues&#13;
18.    Sector Performance.  Weak management of institutions, and an unsatisfactory regulatory&#13;
framework have caused the transport sector to have a major negative impact on the overall economy.&#13;
The Government gave priority to investment and to protection of PEs.  As a result, transport&#13;
infrastructure has lacked maintenance and PEs have drained scarce State resources. The consequences&#13;
are a lack of competitiveness within the transport sector, the running down of existing assets, and a&#13;
lack of resources for investment.&#13;

19.    Weak Sector Management and Institutions.  Sector ministries are overstaffed and have&#13;
interfered negatively with PE management and decisions on staffing, operations and investments.&#13;
Ministries' responsibilities overlap. The Government institutions involved are the Ministry of Public&#13;
Works (MINTP), with about 6,700 employees, and the Ministry of Transport (MINT), with about 880&#13;
employees.  MINTP runs an inefficient, unaccountable road maintenance system driven by force&#13;
account.  MINT's role is to oversee transport PEs, but instead, it has interfered with their&#13;
management, hindering both their autonomy and performance.  MINT initiates and supervises&#13;
regulations for road, rail, air, and transit and maritime transport.  It also oversees the Shippers'&#13;
Council (CNCC), which controls the distribution of Cameroon's maritime traffic under the United&#13;
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)'s Code of Conduct (40-40-20), negotiates&#13;
liner conference tariffs, and represents Cameroonian shippers' interests.&#13;
20.   The functions of the Directorate of Large Works of Cameroon (DGTC), which has about 150&#13;
employees, overlap with those of the other sector institutions. DGTC reports to the Prime Ministry.&#13;
It prepares and supervises large works, including roads. DGTC has given priority to investment to the&#13;
detriment of maintenance. Road investment has not been coordinated between DGTC and MINTP.&#13;
DGTC has not achieved its objective of reducing construction costs and making enterprises comply&#13;
with contractual time stipulations. The Government has thus far rejected IDA's recommendation to&#13;
give full management responsibility in the road subsector to MINTP, and to stop DGTC's involvement&#13;
as executing agency for large road works. DGTC also procures contracts above about US$100,000&#13;
equivalent for ministries, and about US$365,000 for PEs.  DGTC serves as a secretariat to the&#13;
National Tender Board on procurement decisions. The country procurement review carried out by&#13;
IDA in 1993, qualified the local procurement procedures as critically deficient because of little&#13;
transparency in bid evaluation and award of contracts, resulting in long procurement processing and&#13;
high costs. IDA and the Government of Cameroon agreed on a revised national procurement code in&#13;
December 1994. Thresholds for DGTC's involvement would be above US$1 million for works,&#13;
US$0.6 million for goods, and US$0.4 million for consultants. Implementation of the new code is part&#13;
of the macro-economic reform supported by the proposed SAC.&#13;
21.    Unsatisfactory Regulatory Framework.  The current framework is an obstacle to effective&#13;
competition in some transport subsectors and is dysfunctional overall:&#13;
(a)    Civil Aviation: Domestic fares on routes serviced by CAMAIR are regulated and&#13;
subsidized. Other domestic companies were authorized in 1994 to operate regular or&#13;
charter flights in Cameroon. Regional and international air cargo services are not&#13;
developed, although the market does exist. High aviation fuel prices in Cameroon due&#13;
to local taxes impede civil aviation development.&#13;
(b)    Railway: The transport component of the price structure for petroleum products does&#13;
not promote competition and does not encourage petroleum companies to use the&#13;
railway to transport these products within the country despite its comparative&#13;
advantage, especially for transport towards the Northern regions.&#13;
(c)    Urban Transport: The Government has decided to liquidate SOTUC, the urban bus&#13;
company, which held the monopoly on urban transport with more than seven-seat&#13;
vehicles. The regulation needs to be revised accordingly.&#13;
(d)    Interurban Road Transport: A bureau of freight was created in 1994 to control the&#13;
distribution of transit traffic to Chad and the Central African Republic between&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Cameroonian, Chadian and Central African transporters.  This is likely to reduce&#13;
sector efficiency and increase transport costs. The road taxation system is complex and&#13;
cumbersome, with about 15 taxes collected at different stages, by different institutions.&#13;
(e)    Maritime transport: The negotiations of tariffs between shipping lines and the shippers'&#13;
council have kept tariffs at the same official level for several years, although they have&#13;
decreased in the rest of the world on average by an annual 4 percent between 1980 and&#13;
1992, and by an annual 7 percent since 1989. These negotiations and unofficial rebates&#13;
proposed by the shipping lines cause lack a of transparency in the transport market.&#13;
The current regulation protects the national shipping lines, and its application causes&#13;
delays and increases costs of international maritime transport, thereby impeding the&#13;
country's competitiveness (see background note on maritime transport regulation in&#13;
sub-Saharan countries in Schedule 2).&#13;
22.   Non-Performing Transport Sector Public Enterprises. Seven PEs are under the jurisdiction of&#13;
MINT: the national airline (CAMAIR), with about 1,600 employees; the railway company&#13;
(REGIFERCAM) with about 4,000 employees, operating about 1,000 km of railways; the urban bus&#13;
company (SOTUC) with about 1,050 employees, operating bus lines in Yaounde and Douala; the&#13;
national shipping line (CAMSHIP) with about 280 employees, including 80 sailors; the national freight&#13;
forwarder and road transport company (CAMTAINER) with about 200 employees; the National Port&#13;
Authority (ONPC) with about 1,000 employees, managing Cameroon's main port at Douala and three&#13;
secondary ports, and the national dockyard (CNIC) with about 130 employees, operating a maritime&#13;
workshop and dry-dock. Two PEs fall under the jurisdiction of MINTP: the equipment pool for road&#13;
maintenance (MATGENIE) with about 400 employees, and the road laboratory (LABOGENIE) with&#13;
about 530 employees, which controls the norms and standards of road and building construction, and&#13;
carries out research.&#13;
23.    Seven out of nine transport sector PEs are bankrupt and drain huge resources from the State&#13;
budget. The transport sector PEs' debts and arrears severely constrain the State Treasury. At the end&#13;
of FY93, direct subsidies needed to cover transport PEs' deficit amounted to US$55 million,&#13;
equivalent to 8 percent of the State revenues. About US$240 million of subsidies had been allocated to&#13;
transport sector PEs between FY90 and FY92, of which 84 percent to CAMAIR. As of 1994, the total&#13;
domestic debt for the nine sector PEs is estimated at CFAF 122 billion, US$236 million equivalent&#13;
(Table 1). This accounts for about 24 percent of the total debt of the 34 major PEs in Cameroon, 6&#13;
percent of the total domestic debt and 3 percent of the gross domestic product. REGIFERCAM,&#13;
CAMSHIP and SOTUC are the most important debtors to the State among transport PEs. Transport&#13;
PEs owe US$74 million to the State, which amounts to 19 percent of the total PE debt due do the&#13;
State. SOTUC, MATGENIE, ONPC and LABOGENIE are the most important creditors of the State&#13;
among transport PEs. The State owes US$93 million to these enterprises which accounts to 22 percent&#13;
of the total State's debt due to PEs. Schedule 3 presents the key data which measure the importance of&#13;
the transport sector PEs among the PE sector.&#13;

24.    In 1993/94, CAMAIR had an estimated debt of about US$78 million, with arrears of about&#13;
US$55 million, and a negative net worth of US$20 million, against assets of US$50 million. On the&#13;
basis of projected operating losses and debt service requirements, the company would need an annual&#13;
US$10 million subsidy to continue, and still be unable to renew its equipment when it reaches the end&#13;
of its economic life in five years.  Financial and operational management is poor and lacks&#13;
transparency. Fraud is widespread. The company is overstaffed by about 800 employees. CAMAIR&#13;
operates one B-747, and three short haul carriers (B-737) for regional and domestic flights.  A&#13;
company profile of CAMAIR and key financial data are presented in Schedule 4.&#13;
25.    Several attempts to restructure the company failed because the Government interfered with&#13;
management, in particular with respect to staffing decision. The company maintains the presidential&#13;
fleet without being paid for the service, and civil servants use CAMAIR without the Government&#13;
paying for all tickets.  The agreements under the performance contract concluded between the&#13;
Government and CAMAIR as part of the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) conditionalities were&#13;
largely unfulfilled. The agreement to prepare a sale and lease-back arrangement for CAMAIR's long&#13;
haul carrier (B-747), signed by the Minister of Finance under the SAL, was rescinded by the President&#13;
of Cameroon. Despite the appointment, in October 1992, of a Director-General from Air France,&#13;
which is a minority shareholder (25 percent), the situation has not improved. Since 1992, when Air&#13;
France purchased UTA, the former French airline which serviced Cameroon, Air France's&#13;
participation and technical assistance entail a conflict of interest as the airline competes with CAMAIR&#13;
on the Douala-Paris line.&#13;
26.    REGIFERCAM's long-term debt (mostly in foreign currency) stood at about US$75 million&#13;
equivalent on June 30, 1994. Arrears to various bilateral donors, suppliers, and local banks amount to&#13;
about US$40 million equivalent.  Arrears to the Social Security system  amount to about US$15&#13;
million. During FY93, the enterprise incurred an operating loss, before subsidies, of about US$20&#13;
million (down from about US$52 million in 1988). Growth of log and timber traffic in 1994 has&#13;
improved the cash-flow situation but the long-term situation remains the same because of the&#13;
importance of the debt. The company plays an important role in domestic freight and transit transport.&#13;
Logs, wheat and flour, petroleum products, cotton, and transit goods are the largest items using&#13;
railway services.  In addition, the company provides passenger services to and from  Northern&#13;
Cameroon (at 620 km from Yaounde and 880 km from Douala), which is linked to other regions by an&#13;
earth road in poor condition. A company profile of REGIFERCAM and key financial data are&#13;
presented in Schedule 5.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27.    The company made substantial efforts within the framework of the performance contract signed&#13;
with the Government under the SAL in 1989. The management has been more commercially oriented&#13;
and has full autonomy to set tariffs and negotiate contracts. The number of employees was reduced&#13;
from 6,350 to about 4,000. REGIFERCAM concluded agreements with the State on compensation for&#13;
operating unprofitable passenger transport services under public service obligations. Some auxiliary&#13;
activities were privatized. But Government still interferes with some management and procurement&#13;
decisions, therefore limiting the potential for further efforts which would be required in view of the&#13;
still weak financial situation of the company.&#13;
28.    SOTUC, which owns 229 buses (107 in Yaounde and 122 in Douala), has been unprofitable&#13;
since 1988. In 1994, only about half of its buses were operational, and this number was rapidly&#13;
dwindling because of lack of maintenance. In FY93, SOTUC's net loss amounted to about US$7&#13;
million equivalent, with a turnover of US$4 million. By June 30, 1993, its negative net worth&#13;
amounted to about US$56 million equivalent, against assets with a book value of US$12 million. Its&#13;
arrears to banks, employees, suppliers, the Treasury, and the Social Security system amount to about&#13;
US$45 million. The Government's policy of maintaining a high number of staff, insisting on operating&#13;
uneconomic routes, and setting preferential tariffs for certain segments of the population has been the&#13;
principal cause of SOTUC's failure. It would have cost the State about US$7 million annually to&#13;
continue operating SOTUC over the next few years. A performance contract signed under the SAL&#13;
was never implemented. In 1994, because salaries had not been paid for more than one year, the&#13;
company had been defacto taken over by its employees who ran the buses for their own account. A&#13;
company profile of SOTUC and key financial data are presented in Schedule 6.&#13;
29.    Before devaluation, SOTUC's market share was less than 5 percent of total urban transport,&#13;
which is very low compared, for example, to 22 percent in Conakry and 41 percent in Abidjan for&#13;
similar public bus transport.  The police and military accounted for 28 percent of SOTUC's&#13;
passengers, but only 8 percent of its revenues. Students also paid reduced fares or no fare at all. The&#13;
Government has never compensated SOTUC for the full deficit caused by public service. Between&#13;
1986 and 1991, passenger volume dropped from 152,000 per day to 44,000, a decline of 70 percent in&#13;
five years. Most urban trips are done by private vehicles, by taxis or by foot. Until 1994, the taxi&#13;
fleet was estimated at about 5,000 in Yaounde and 5,500 in Douala. It is now shrinking and the&#13;
condition of vehicles is deteriorating quickly after the devaluation.  Transport tariffs cannot be&#13;
increased because the revenue per capita decreased significantly following salary reductions in 1993.&#13;
The cost of spare parts and new vehicles is now too expensive for owners to maintain or renew the&#13;
fleet. The share of the population walking is now estimated at around 40 percent.&#13;
30.    CAMSIHP's principal problem is a lack of competitiveness. Accordingly, it has been unable&#13;
to capture its full quota of Cameroon's merchandise trade under the UNCTAD's Code of Conduct,&#13;
despite the 34% participation of German shareholders, and was technically bankrupt until 1993. Until&#13;
FY89, CAMSHIP made profits of about US$6 million on sales of about US$80 million. In 1991, its&#13;
operating loss reached US$4.4 million, which increased to US$6 million before taxes in 1992. Its&#13;
working capital was negative by US$1 million in 1991. CAMSHIP owns two vessels and charters&#13;
ships for petroleum and clinker. Its vessels generate an annual loss of about US$1.5 million as they are&#13;
more costly to operate than modern ships (US$14,000 daily versus US$8,000). In June 1993, net&#13;
equity stood at below 75 percent of the company's initial capital, thus implying bankruptcy. The&#13;
company's liquidation value was estimated at US$20 million in 1993, below its cash-flow of US$32&#13;
million, calculated on a net present value basis of 20 years at the 20 percent annual interest rate&#13;
prevailing in Cameroon.&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31.   CAMSHIP's debt was substantially restructured in an amount of US$21 million in a&#13;
convention concluded with the State in September 1993. The Government agreed to: (a) transfer to the&#13;
State the additional US$11 million debt incurred in the purchase, arranged by the Government, of two&#13;
vessels at above market value; and (b) reschedule over eight years the remaining bilateral debt due by&#13;
CAMSHIP, and assume that debt. As a result, the June 30, 1994, balance sheet shows a profit.&#13;
However, this agreement was not signed by the private shareholders of CAMSHIP, who do not agree&#13;
to participate in the capital increase as intended in the agreement. In addition, the company remains&#13;
burdened by its lead share (27 percent, US$2.6 million) in a real estate holding (SIMAR) created by&#13;
the Government to build a maritime office building, which has substantial arrears on its mortgage&#13;
payments (US$13 million). The mortgage banks could call the entire loan balance. Besides being a&#13;
financial burden on the State Treasury, the company impacts adversely on the maritime sector's&#13;
efficiency and competitiveness and on the country's economy. This is because application of quotas to&#13;
shippers under the UNCTAD's Code of Conduct results in high transport costs due to the absence of&#13;
competition between shipping lines servicing Cameroon. In addition, delays in transport operations&#13;
arise from cumbersome procedures created by the efforts of Cameroonian authorities to allocate its full&#13;
quota of traffic to CAMSHIP. A company profile and key financial data are presented in Schedule 7.&#13;
32.    CAMTAINER is heavily leveraged with an 87/13 debt/equity ratio, and has insufficient&#13;
revenues to meet debt service obligations. As a result of competition with other companies and its&#13;
overdesign at its creation, CAMTAINER has been unable to recover the cost of the initial investment&#13;
and is unprofitable.  In early-1995, its foreign partners (45%  German and Danish institutional&#13;
investors) agreed to debt-relief to improve the company's cash-flow. A company profile and key&#13;
financial data are presented in Schedule 8.&#13;
33.   ONPC breaks even, but at much too high costs and tariffs, and without providing efficient&#13;
services. Expenditures are estimated at one third above the normal level for the services rendered,&#13;
because of overstaffing and past over-investment. ONPC's management lacks both autonomy and&#13;
accountability. ONPC has been unable to maintain the access channel, whose depth was reduced from&#13;
7.2 m after rehabilitation in 1989, to 5.4 m in 1992. Lack of maintenance has resulted in the need for&#13;
more rehabilitation. The investment policy has not been based on financial return and capacity to&#13;
service the debt. ONPC is considering an unrealistic five-year US$275 million investment program, the&#13;
equivalent of 40% of overall Government investment, to finance a new dredger, a new container&#13;
terminal, the rehabilitation of the channel and construction of calibration dikes, the rehabilitation of the&#13;
Douala port infrastructure, the renovation of secondary ports, and the construction of two deep-sea&#13;
ports.  This plan is supported by the Government for political reasons, but the financing is not&#13;
available for its most important components. In FY93, salaries increased by 12 percent, although port&#13;
traffic remained the same than in FY92. Early 1995, the Government has contracted out the management&#13;
of a secondary port to a private investor.&#13;
34.   ONPC's tariffs are set arbitrarily and do not reflect costs.  Analytical accounting is being&#13;
implemented to provide the basis for a more accurate calculation of tariffs. ONPC increased its tariffs&#13;
for ships by 100 percent to 300 percent after devaluation, and intends to increase its other tariffs on&#13;
goods. ONPC revenues totaled US$33 million after devaluation, down from US$48 million before&#13;
devaluation, and were obtained from ships (piloting, tug boat services, occupation of berth space) for&#13;
about US$18 million, from goods for US$8 million, from renting-out warehouses and port space for&#13;
about US$6 million, and from non-port activities, such as the production and sale of ice, utilities and&#13;
other items. The operating results ranged between positive and negative during FY89-94. However,&#13;
until 1993, ONPC experienced serious liquidity shortages due to outstanding revenues on port tariffs&#13;
collected by customs, transferred to the Treasury, and partially from the Treasury to ONPC. A&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
substantial portion of ONPC's costs were derived from short-term bank lending to cover these dues,&#13;
amounting to about 30 percent of ONPC's revenues. At the end of 1993, the Ministry of Economy&#13;
and Finance agreed to let ONPC collect these revenues itself. A company profile and key financial&#13;
data are presented in Schedule 9.&#13;
35.   With Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) financing approved in 1987, ONPC&#13;
intends to modernize its container terminal. The project includes the provision of two ship-to-shore&#13;
cranes, four yard cranes and other equipment, as well as infrastructure rehabilitation. Total investment&#13;
cost, including the provision of spare parts during three years, is estimated at US$16 million. The&#13;
type of management has not yet been confirmed.  Operation and annual maintenance costs are&#13;
estimated at US$2.2 million and would entail a significant increase, ranging from 26 percent to 38&#13;
percent, in the container tariff. The economic rate of return of the investment is below 10 percent, and&#13;
would not be above this threshold until the year 2005, when Douala is expected to regain its&#13;
1985/1986 business level. ONPC's and Government's decision to proceed with the investment was the&#13;
main reason the Bank closed the Third Douala Port Project and canceled its undisbursed balance of&#13;
about US$1.8 million. In 1992, the Government, ONPC, OECF and the Bank agreed to the project&#13;
implementation schedule and the need for improvement in dredging execution to maximize the benefits&#13;
of the project. As a result, the channel depth increased from -5.4 m to -5.9 m in 1993.&#13;
36.   CNIC is subsidized by using the dry-dock without amortizing it in its accounts, and not paying&#13;
a lease to the State as the owner. It is reasonably well managed, but tends to seek Government's&#13;
assistance and favored treatment for work orders.  Its development plan is not consistent with its&#13;
financial capacity to service the debt, and CNIC expects the Government to cover the financing gap.&#13;
In 1994, CNIC's tariffs became more competitive because of the devaluation. The balance sheet has&#13;
continually improved since the creation of the dockyard, and showed profits for FY94. A company&#13;
profile and key financial data are presented in Schedule 10.&#13;
37.   MATGENIE has faced a liquidity crisis for several years because of accumulating Government&#13;
debts for services rendered in road construction and maintenance.  In 1993, the Government's&#13;
outstanding debt amounted to US$25 million. The company was overstaffed by about one third.&#13;
Unpaid salaries for more than one year led to low morale and strikes. MATGENIE's management and&#13;
Government did not move to improve the situation until 1994, when a new manager was appointed and&#13;
a restructuring plan prepared.  The plan was implemented in September 1994 with a new&#13;
administrative chart and staff reduction by about 50 percent, equivalent to 40 percent of the total salary&#13;
bill. Also, the management reduced salaries by 10 percent in January 1995. A company profile and&#13;
key financial data are presented in Schedule 11.&#13;
38.   Although LABOGENIE monopolized road laboratory works in Cameroon until recently, its&#13;
financial performance has deteriorated. Arrears from the Government, which was the only client,&#13;
amount to US$7 million. Due to external donor pressure, the market was opened to competition, and&#13;
LABOGENIE has benefited from externally-financed contracts, reducing its dependency on&#13;
Government financing. However, the volume of road construction works has severely decreased,&#13;
thereby strengthening the need for restructuring the company. Although LABOGENIE's staff was&#13;
reduced from 821 to 526 in 1991, the company remains overstaffed. With the Bank's assistance under&#13;
the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 2584-CM), financial management and commercial orientation have&#13;
improved. A company profile and key financial data are presented in Schedule 12.&#13;
39.   III Conceived Investments. Sector investments were oversized and did not take recurrent costs&#13;
into account. The Public Investment Program (PIP) has not reflected sector priorities or been based on&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
economic criteria and availability of local funds. For example, a new airport built in Yaounde for 1.5&#13;
million passengers per year is used by less than 100,000 passengers.  In Maroua, the airport's&#13;
rehabilitation is incomplete due to a lack of funds. Meanwhile, the main airport in Douala, with about&#13;
400,000 passengers per year, is not maintained and is deteriorating. In 1992-1993, the Government&#13;
sought financing for a new four-lane expressway between Yaounde and the new airport, while it lacked&#13;
the funds to maintain the road network. The port authority of Douala intends to build a new container&#13;
terminal equipped with expensive, sophisticated cranes, while the access channel to the port is&#13;
insufficiently dredged. To improve port access, the port authority envisages the construction of dikes&#13;
at a very high cost. In addition to these investments in the port of Douala, the Government is still&#13;
considering the construction of two deep-sea ports, which would undercut the investments in the port&#13;
of Douala. A 6 billion CFA dry-yard, purchased in 1988, is used well below its capacity because the&#13;
demand for ship repair is low, and the dry-yard is located in shallow waters which limit its operating&#13;
capacity. Finally, several investments in the transport sector were begun but not completed for lack of&#13;
financing, resulting in the loss of what had been executed.&#13;
40.    Although subject to lengthy discussions between the Bank and the Government, the PIP for the&#13;
transport sector is still far from being an effective programmning tool. The economic or financial&#13;
justification of projects is not provided. Data are not regularly updated and do not reflect actual&#13;
execution of projects. Reform in this area is expected to be implemented under the proposed SAC.&#13;
41.    Lack of Maintenance of Existing Infrastructure. During the past ten years, priority given to&#13;
investments has resulted in neglect of transport infrastructure maintenance.  In addition, several&#13;
weaknesses hamper maintenance:&#13;
(a)    Poor management. Procedures do not exist to establish consistent annual objectives&#13;
and monitor the performance of maintenance units. This results in inefficient use of&#13;
force account for routine and periodic road maintenance, and the maintenance of the&#13;
access channel to the port of Douala.&#13;
(b)    Weak institutions. The institutional framework has never encouraged accountability&#13;
within the institutions responsible for maintenance, nor from these institutions to the&#13;
Government, nor from the Government to infrastructure users.&#13;
(c)    Poor funding procedures. The local budget for road maintenance is insufficient, and,&#13;
with the State budget crisis, barely allows for payment of salaries to civil servants.&#13;
The port does not have a specific funding procedure for the maintenance of the channel&#13;
and gives priority to the payment of salaries.&#13;
(d)    Inadequate donor strategy.  Until recently, donor assistance focused on investments&#13;
rather than maintenance.&#13;
42.    Although ONPC's (National Port Authority) dredging crew has technical capacity, the current&#13;
institutional framework in which ONPC's dredging department operates, and the technical constraints&#13;
of its dredger, make it impossible for ONPC to satisfactorily perform such dredging. The dredging&#13;
performance has rapidly declined since 1988 when the contract with foreign expertise was terminated.&#13;
This contract provided for rehabilitation and maintenance of the 22 km long access channel through the&#13;
Wouri river, from the sea to the port of Douala. Heavy siltation of the Wouri river has reduced the&#13;
depth of the channel from -7.5 m after rehabilitation, to about -5.4 m at the end of 1992. Shipping&#13;
lines are forced to enter and depart with reduced loads, and to spend costly idle time at the quay or at&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the channel entrance awaiting high tides. CAMSHIP's vessels depart with about 3,000 tons below load&#13;
capacity. In 1993 and 1994, following the dredger's overhaul and donor pressure, the channel depth&#13;
was increased to about -5.9 m, but is still well below the minimum of -6.5 m needed for satisfactory&#13;
port performance.&#13;
43.    The low productivity of road maintenance is caused by inefficient planning and management,&#13;
slow budgeting and payment procedures, non performing force account teams, defective equipment&#13;
and, for the past two years, a lack of financing. MINTP has insufficient knowledge of the status of the&#13;
road network or the actual cost of maintenance. The 3,700 km of paved road network is mostly in fair&#13;
condition because it is relatively recent and has been well maintained with German assistance until&#13;
1992, but is now beginning to deteriorate. The 22,000 km of earth road network is now mostly in&#13;
poor to very poor condition. The 25,000 km of rural road network, which has not been maintained for&#13;
several years because of lack of financing, is now in very poor condition, and will need to be&#13;
rehabilitated or rebuilt. During FY93, only some 6,000 km of the 51,000 km road network were&#13;
maintained, while maintenance almost ceased in FY94.  In 1990-1991, the availability rate of&#13;
equipment leased by MATGENIE to the Department of Highway Maintenance was only 56 percent.&#13;
The rate has since decreased because of MATGENIE's lack of maintenance of equipment.&#13;
44.    The weak fiscal situation and priority given by the Government to the payment of salaries and&#13;
to the service of the external debt are the reasons for the lack of financing for road maintenance. In&#13;
1993/1994, total government revenue amounted to US$650 million against US$1,245 million of&#13;
planned expenditure. Salaries and the service of the external debt accounted for US$1,000 million, 50&#13;
percent more than Government revenue.  Although the Government has acknowledged that road&#13;
maintenance is the second priority after salaries in the allocation of resources, it has been unable to&#13;
make the necessary resources available. In 1985/1986, about US$100 million, excluding salaries of&#13;
MINTP staff, were allocated from local and external resources to the road subsector for road&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation. In 1991, this allocation was reduced to about US$27 million. That&#13;
year, the shortfall in the annual volume of maintenance works (i.e., the difference between road&#13;
maintenance expenditure necessary to maintain the entire network of 51,000 km and the amount&#13;
actually spent) was estimated at US$144 million. In 1992-1993, the actual amount spent for road&#13;
maintenance was about US$10 million. Salaries amounted to about US$7 million in 1993-1994. In&#13;
comparison, the fiscal revenues collected from the transport sector were estimated at US$130 million&#13;
in 1993-1994, about 20% of government revenue. US$60 million (46 percent) were collected from&#13;
taxes specific to the transport sector, of which US$53 million from taxation on petroleum products.&#13;
Detailed data on road maintenance budget and performance are presented in Schedule 13.&#13;
45.    Lack of Competitiveness.  The costs caused by weak port management, protection of the&#13;
national shipping line, together with the inadequate legal, fiscal, and regulatory framework, and poorly&#13;
maintained infrastructure, aggravate Cameroon's lack of competitiveness in transit transport, both&#13;
within the country, as well as to and from the neighboring hinterland (Chad and Central African&#13;
Republic-CAR). Before devaluation, the cost of road transport was high (about four times the cost in&#13;
Pakistan and twice the cost in France) and hindered the competitiveness of export products of the&#13;
Central African countries. The many cumbersome customs regulations to control evasion of customs&#13;
duties cause delays in transit. In spite of these regulations, about half of the customs revenues are lost&#13;
because of fraud and an inefficient bureaucracy. Financial transactions associated with clearing and&#13;
transiting import freight into and out of the region significantly increase the cost of transit transport.&#13;
Transaction costs paid by transit and transport operators to customs and police agents to ease transit&#13;
operations range between 6 percent and 29 percent of land transport for a 15-ton container in transit to&#13;
CAR and Chad. According to IMF data, the cost of regional non-factor services on imports in 1992-&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1993 was 16 percent for Cameroon, 39 percent for Chad and 31 percent for the Central African&#13;
Republic.&#13;
46.    The main obstacles in the transit chain are summarized below:&#13;
(a)    Freight-forwarders charge 1.25 percent of the shipment's value to shippers to cover&#13;
posting a bond, although the actual cost of the bond charged by a bank is 0.25 percent&#13;
per quarter.&#13;
(b)    Premiums for transport insurance must be paid to local insurance companies which&#13;
have insufficient resources and competence to settle damages, and are also often paid to&#13;
foreign companies.&#13;
(c)    The signature of customs documents by the Minister of Finance is compulsory for&#13;
transit of "sensitive" goods (textiles, alcoholic beverages, goods produced in Cameroon&#13;
at higher than world market prices).&#13;
(d)    Customs escorts are compulsory for transit transport until the border, at the cost of the&#13;
importer, to ensure that goods exit Cameroon.&#13;
47.    Lack of security in the port of Douala also impedes Cameroon's competitiveness for transit&#13;
traffic and increases port transit costs. Port facilities and areas are openly accessible to non-authorized&#13;
persons, as check points are not efficiently manned. The presence of the administrative offices of&#13;
Customs in the center of the port generates uncontrolled traffic. Police do not effectively control the&#13;
port area. Pilferage is common during unloading of general merchandise, and containers selected by&#13;
Customs for inspection are often found vandalized thereafter. Although ONPC is legally empowered&#13;
to protect the port against theft and disorder, it shifts the responsibility to the Government. The port&#13;
handling companies have made their own private arrangements at additional costs for the goods.&#13;
III. Transport Sector Reforn Program&#13;
48.   The Government has developed an overall transport sector reform program to complete the&#13;
adjustment of the sector institutions and address the financial issues in the sector. This program has been&#13;
extensively discussed between the Government, IDA, and other donors. The program seeks to enable&#13;
the sector to resume its contribution to development instead of being a constraint to the country's&#13;
economic growth.  It is a phased program, aimed at improving mobilization and allocation of&#13;
resources, maintenance of transport infrastructure, and the overall efficiency of the sector.  These&#13;
objectives would be achieved through State divestiture from transport operations, increased&#13;
competition, more focused institutions, and an improved regulatory framework. The program is&#13;
described in paragraphs 49 to 69. Benefits expected from the program are described in para. 70.&#13;
Program  implementation and priorities are described in para. 71.  Some issues still require&#13;
Government decisions for their resolution. Such resolution is being pursued as part of the dialogue&#13;
between the Government and IDA covering the ongoing preparation of IDA projects in the transport&#13;
sector (see para. 76).&#13;
49.    Civil Aviation. The Government has agreed to privatize both the domestic and international air&#13;
transport operations in Cameroon. The agreed strategy consists of the winding-down of CAMAIR and&#13;
the creation of a new company for the provision of air services. One of the following options, or a&#13;
combination of both, would be used to transfer control and ownership of the new company to the&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
private sector: (a) capitalization of the new company by a group of private investors with full&#13;
management control; or (b) management contract with deferred privatization option as a mechanism to&#13;
improve the airline performance and generate private sector involvement.  There is a potential for&#13;
private provision of air services, both by national investors or in partnership with foreign carriers. In&#13;
1994, a national air carrier, which initially operated as subcontractor for CAMAIR, and a charter&#13;
company for local services were authorized to operate in Cameroon. South African Airways has also&#13;
hinted at possible cooperation. However, if the private sector were not interested in participating in the&#13;
ownership of the new company, the Government would divest the aviation related assets and auction&#13;
the traffic rights to domestic/regional air carriers.  The detailed strategy, the timetable for the&#13;
privatization of air services, and key financial data after privatization are presented in Schedule 14.&#13;
Benefits resulting from this privatization are presented in Schedule 17. Bidding for the selection of the&#13;
private strategic partner is expected to be launched before the end of 1995. Privatization is expected to&#13;
be completed within two years after the selection of the strategic partner.&#13;
50.    An outright liquidation of CAMAIR would be politically unacceptable.  The Government&#13;
attaches great importance to CAMAIR as the national flag carrier, not only because it services&#13;
domestic routes, but also because it puts Cameroon on the map regionally and internationally. The&#13;
Government also considers that Cameroon, a country with a population of 12 million, needs a domestic&#13;
air service. The Government recognizes that a solution needs to be found, which would be compatible&#13;
with political constraints, to stop subsidizing air services. IDA's position is that Cameroon is entitled&#13;
to an air service provided that it is efficient, not subsidized, and operates on market principles,&#13;
preferably with a majority of private shareholders.  Following the detailed studies carried out on&#13;
CAMAIR with PPF financing, the Government requested that concrete proposals be presented, which&#13;
resulted in the strategy mentioned above. The following options were also considered but rejected: (a)&#13;
elimination of budget support, which would be difficult to enforce because the Government is likely to&#13;
find ways of continuing to subsidize the company by using off-budget accounts, such as oil revenues,&#13;
or by cutting spending in vital sectors; and (b) execution of another performance contract, which was&#13;
unsuccessfully attempted under the SAL (1989).&#13;
51.   In order to increase the efficiency for the provision of air transport services in Cameroon, and&#13;
to promote private sector participation, the regulatory framework should be revised before completion&#13;
of privatization:&#13;
(a)    to deregulate the domestic passenger market, including the Yaound6-Douala route, to&#13;
open competition between domestic carriers;&#13;
(b)    to open the cargo market, both in the local and international segments, through more&#13;
flexibility in the use of charter flights to allow for competition and competitive rates;&#13;
(c)    to gradually adjust domestic fares, in line with market rates, through planned price&#13;
increases with the domestic carriers;&#13;
(d)    to use explicit and efficiency-driven subsidies in the case of social routes; and&#13;
(e)    to establish a jet-fuel price policy in line with international standards.&#13;
52.    Railway.  The Government has agreed to separate the ownership of the infrastructure and&#13;
railway operations by creating a new private company to commercially operate railway services for&#13;
freight through a concession agreement. The core shareholders of the new operating company would&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be selected following international bidding procedures.  The Government has still to choose the&#13;
conditions of operations for passenger services from four options: (a) include the services in the&#13;
concession agreement as public service obligations; (b) contract an agreement with a private company&#13;
distinct from the concessionary company for freight; (c) replace rail passenger services by bus services&#13;
and contract a private company for the operation of these services; and (d) stop providing passenger&#13;
services while maintaining the roads accessing the villages along the railway track. Maintenance costs&#13;
are being estimated. The detailed strategy, the timetable for the privatization of railway operations,&#13;
key financial data after privatization and a preliminary risk analysis for both Government and private&#13;
investors are presented in Schedule 15. Benefits resulting from the privatization are presented in&#13;
Schedule 17.  Bidding for the selection of the private majority shareholder of the concessionary&#13;
company is expected to be launched before the end of 1995. A decision on passenger services has to&#13;
be taken before completing bidding documents.&#13;
53.   Revision of the regulatory framework is needed to accompany the privatization of railway&#13;
operations:&#13;
(a)   The transport component of the price structure for petroleum products should be&#13;
revised to promote competition between transport modes and encourage petroleum&#13;
companies to use the less expensive mode of transport.&#13;
(b)    The railway transit procedures should be improved. The reform will be implemented&#13;
as part of the UDEAC Transport Reform Program (see paras. 58-59).&#13;
54.    Urban Transport. The Government has agreed to liquidate SOTUC, the public urban bus&#13;
company and liberalize urban transport. A liquidator is being appointed, whose terms of reference&#13;
seek the completion of liquidation within sixth months, once the procedure has begun. On February&#13;
22, 1995, the General Assembly of shareholders officially announced SOTUC's liquidation, and&#13;
services were stopped.  Benefits to the Cameroonian economy resulting from the liquidation, are&#13;
presented in Schedule 17. The conditions of access to the industry, related to vehicle insurance,&#13;
vehicle certification, taxation of activity and vehicle safety are being revised accordingly. A consultant&#13;
has been selected to prepare the revised regulation which is expected to be implemented before July 1,&#13;
1995.&#13;
55.   Interurban Transport. The Government is studying simplification of the taxation system for&#13;
road transport, through the creation of a road tax collected by one institution only (thus replacing&#13;
several taxes collected at different stages, by several institutions), as well as a road user charge, clearly&#13;
identified in the price of petroleum products, to be used to finance road maintenance through a Road&#13;
Maintenance Fund (see paras. 63-64). The Ministry of Economy and Finance has not yet agreed to&#13;
such a simplification, or to the implementation arrangements, but has agreed to the principle of a Road&#13;
Maintenance Fund. Arrangements for the creation of the Fund are being studied in detail, and the&#13;
Fund is expected to be created before the next dry season in October 1995. A presidential dccree was&#13;
recently taken to remove illegal road controls by the administration (police, customs, etc.). MINT is&#13;
envisaging the creation of a committee which would follow up on the compliance with the decree to&#13;
prevent the reappearance of the controls. Toll roads were created in 1993, but revenues have been far&#13;
lower than expected because of fraud, estimated at 50 percent. A decision on their privatization or&#13;
removal will be taken as part of the simplification of the road taxation system. The existing weighing&#13;
bridges on the Douala-Yaounde road are being rehabilitated. They will be used in a first phase to&#13;
monitor truck overloading, and in a second phase to fine overloaded trucks. A pilot operation is being&#13;
prepared by MINTP.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56.    Maritime Transport.  The Government has agreed to privatize CAMSHIP, the national&#13;
shipping line, and to privatize or liquidate CAMTAINER, the national road carrier and freight&#13;
forwarder. The timetable for the privatization of both companies, and key financial data after&#13;
privatization are presented in Schedule 16.  Benefits to the Cameroonian economy resulting from the&#13;
privatization are presented in Schedule 17. Access to the maritime industry by Cameroonian shipping&#13;
lines was liberalized at the end of 1994. However, the Government is still reluctant to fully liberalize&#13;
maritime transport. The 1994 law suppresses CAMSHIP's monopoly, but maintains the application of&#13;
the Code of Conduct and the protection of Cameroonian shipping lines.  The decree defining the&#13;
modalities of application of the law has still to be prepared. As an immediate step of the liberalization&#13;
process, the manner in which the Code of Conduct is applied should be reviewed in order to comply&#13;
with the clauses of the Code. Accordingly, the quota system would be applied to the Liner Conference&#13;
traffic and no more to the entire Cameroonian maritime traffic.  Terms and conditions for freight&#13;
transport outside of the Liner Conference traffic, and currently contracted-out to CAMSHIP (clinker&#13;
and petroleum products), should also be reviewed to decide whether or not these contracts should be&#13;
abolished and retendered. Although the Government has not yet agreed to this step which reduces the&#13;
protection of the Cameroonian shipping lines, its implementation is required to set up an acceptable&#13;
regulatory framework in parallel to the privatization of CAMSHIP. Further steps in the liberalization&#13;
process should be coordinated at the regional level, as part of the Trade and Transport component of&#13;
the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program (SSATP), which involves Sub-Saharan African&#13;
countries and most of the donors involved in transport in this area.  The Trade and Transport&#13;
component aims at establishing a new maritime transport policy for Sub-Saharan African countries.&#13;
The preparation of this new policy is still at the studies stage (Schedule 2). Studies are expected to be&#13;
completed, and recommendations discussed, during a regional seminar of SSATP countries and donors&#13;
in 1996.&#13;
57.    To be consistent with the sector policy, the role of CNCC, the Shippers' Council, will have to&#13;
be revised as part of the decree defining the application of the 1994 law on maritime transport. As a&#13;
first step, CNCC should control a posteriori the application of the Code of Conduct. Financing of&#13;
CNCC by a 0.3 percent surcharge on import/export by sea and waivers paid by shipping lines to&#13;
transport freight toward Africa should be stopped, and CNCC should be financed from the State's&#13;
budget. Further steps will be defined as part of the Trade and Transport SSATP component. The role&#13;
of CNCC was discussed by CNCC, public and private shippers, CAMSHIP, and the Cameroonian&#13;
Administration during a seminar, and during several meetings of a committee created to follow up on&#13;
recommendations made during this seminar. However, the committee's recommendations maintain the&#13;
current role of CNCC and financing means while adding the roles of economic observer of the&#13;
transport sector and strengthening the services to shippers.&#13;
58.    Transit Transport.  Within the Union of Central African States (UDEAC) framework, the&#13;
1989 Joint EU-World Bank initiative launched a transit transport facilitation program in the Central&#13;
Africa subregion. The obstacles to trade and facilitation prevalent throughout the UDEAC customs&#13;
were analyzed by the UDEAC countries during preparation of the transport component of the UDEAC&#13;
Regional Policy Reform Program (Report No. 11296-AFR dated April 30, 1993) in collaboration with&#13;
the EU and IDA. In joint workshops held in November 1991, and in March and December 1993, the&#13;
UDEAC countries agreed to a Program of Regional Reforms to improve transit conditions. National&#13;
Transit Committees were created in the six UDEAC countries to draw up plans to: (a) simplify&#13;
customs documents and devise a system of regional transit under customs bonds (TIPAC); (b) review&#13;
the criteria for establishing bonded customs centers; (c) redefine transit requirements for intermodal&#13;
transport (rail/road, rail/river) and containers; and (d) improve road transport conditions and&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
regulations (maintenance of international itineraries, trucking liabilities, vehicle inspection, and cost&#13;
recovery).&#13;
59.    The TIPAC mechanism is a procedure whereby goods travel duty free across the border under&#13;
customs bonds, accompanied by a bill of lading, with the liability for possible loss of customs duties&#13;
held by the transport operator. The Manual of Procedures for the TIPAC was adopted by the UDEAC&#13;
countries in March 1993. The mechanism is similar to the transit system in Europe (TIR), where this&#13;
liability is guaranteed and surveyed by the International Road Union (IRU). For the liability to be&#13;
credible to customs in UDEAC countries, the bill of lading and the transporter must be covered by a&#13;
regional insurance policy which would reimburse customs for lost duties should the transport operator&#13;
or the importer abuse the mechanism by evading import duties. The insurance policy would be funded&#13;
from the sale of vouchers attached to the bill of lading.  The regional insurance policy is being&#13;
designed and candidate institutions are being identified to manage the insurance policy. EU financing&#13;
is available to provide assistance for the implementation of the TIPAC starting mid-1995. TIPAC&#13;
implementation is expected to be completed two years after commencement of the assistance. An&#13;
action plan and a timetable are provided in Schedule 18.&#13;
60.    The policy measures to be implemented to complement the TIPAC system are the following:&#13;
(a)    streamline road transport regulations to harmonize national and UDEAC transport&#13;
regulations and vehicle standards; harmonize the structure of road user charges;&#13;
enforce control of truck overloading to prevent road deterioration;&#13;
(b)    seek legal registration of customs agents, forwarding agents, and international road&#13;
transporters, and agree to and enforce criteria underlying the approval of such&#13;
registration;&#13;
(c)    harmonize and liberalize freight insurance in UDEAC.&#13;
61.    As most of the obstacles to transit transport occur in Cameroon, the success of this program&#13;
depends to a large extent on the willingness of the Cameroonian authorities to take the necessary&#13;
measures. In addition to the measures to be taken at the regional level, the following measures had to&#13;
be taken by Cameroon:&#13;
(a)    Improve its custom declaration mechanism and the computerized procedures: An audit&#13;
of the computerized system was carried out in 1993, and proposed scenarios for its&#13;
rehabilitation. A second audit should start soon with PPF financing which should&#13;
provide elements for the decision on one of the scenarios and prepare for its&#13;
implementation. A comprehensive audit of the customs services will be carried out by&#13;
the French Ministry of Cooperation in March 1995, to define a plan for improving&#13;
customs' performance and efficiency.&#13;
(b)    Remove the requirements of domiciled invoices and import licenses in Chad and the&#13;
Central African Republic: The measure was taken in 1994.&#13;
(c)    Shorten the list of sensitive goods which require a customs clearance for transit: (on&#13;
going);&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d)    Limit road controls by the administration to those specified in the UDEAC legislation.&#13;
A presidential decree was taken in 1993 to apply the measure.&#13;
(e)    Remove requirements for customs escorts for transit goods through Cameroon. No&#13;
progress has been made.&#13;
62.    The physical component of the transport component of the UDEAC reform program consists&#13;
of: (a) rehabilitation and maintenance of international road itineraries to CAR and Chad, as agreed by&#13;
the UDEAC Steering Committee in June 1993; improvement of the customs facilities in Douala and at&#13;
border crossings with CAR and Chad; (c) rehabilitation of the computerized customs declaration&#13;
system  in Douala, and provision of a modern telecommunication system; and (d) provision of&#13;
international trucking facilities at Douala port.  The rehabilitation of the Cameroon-CAR  road&#13;
itinerary, which is part of component (a), and provision of a modern telecommunication system are&#13;
being executed with EU financing. Detailed engineering studies are underway.&#13;
63.    Road Maintenance. The Government has agreed to a new strategy for road maintenance to&#13;
improve its efficiency and its sustainability:&#13;
(a)    To adjust the road maintenance program to management and financing capacity: A&#13;
priority network of about 20,000 km has been identified based on: economic&#13;
importance (traffic flows); consistency of the network and needs for links between&#13;
urban centers and regions of agricultural production; communication between&#13;
administrative centers; and regional equity.&#13;
(b)    To  disengage  itself from  maintenance  execution:  Periodic  maintenance  and&#13;
rehabilitation of all paved roads, as well as periodic maintenance of earth roads, and&#13;
progressively routine maintenance of earth and paved roads would be contracted-out to&#13;
private contractors, including the local construction industry, small contractors, village&#13;
workers, and communities, using labor-intensive methods and local materials, where&#13;
possible.&#13;
(c)    To  improve planning  and  programming  capacity: A  pluri-annual maintenance&#13;
programming system is being established using as criteria the existing level of service&#13;
of the priority road network, and also climatological, geographical and geotechnical&#13;
parameters. The system is being defined under an IDA-financed study for earth roads,&#13;
and German-financed study for paved roads.&#13;
(d)    To focus MINTP's role on planning, programming and budgeting, supervising works&#13;
and controlling objectives: External audits of technical and financial performance and&#13;
procurement procedures would be carried out to ensure accountability.  MINTP&#13;
restructuring is being defined accordingly under a PPF-financed on-going study.&#13;
(e)    To encourage development of small and medium contractors by providing training in&#13;
technical and financial management; by creating a stable market; by defining policies to&#13;
eliminate present constraints to private sector participation; by revising procurement&#13;
regulations; and by establishing a rapid payment system because small contractors do&#13;
not have sufficient working capital to prefinance expenditures for works: The new&#13;
framework and procedures are being defined with PPF financing.&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(f)    To ensure sustainability of road maintenance financing and transparency and&#13;
accountability in the use of funds. A Road Maintenance Fund would be used as a&#13;
mechanism to achieve these objectives. The mechanism is being defined under a PPF-&#13;
financed on-going study.&#13;
64.   The strategy is expected to be implemented before the 1995 dry season (period when road&#13;
maintenance works are carried out). Subject to approval by the Minister of Finance, the Government&#13;
intends to submit the creation of the Road Maintenance Fund to the National Assembly in June 1995,&#13;
during discussions on the FY96 budget. Implementation of the new strategy is being tested under EU&#13;
financing. A road maintenance program amounting to about US$26 million is being contracted out to&#13;
38 small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The bidding procedure is on going. SMEs which had been&#13;
preselected, received a training on procurement and management of road works. Lessons learned form&#13;
this project will be used to prepare the application of the new strategy on the entire priority network.&#13;
Caisse Franraise de Developpement also intends to contract-out a rural road maintenance program to&#13;
SMEs to start at the end of 1995.&#13;
65.   MATGENIE. The Government has agreed to retrench on its equipment rental activity. A&#13;
PPF-financed study is being revised to review the feasibility of splitting MATGENIE into four separate&#13;
entities, located in four different regions. This option would make it easier to progressively privatize&#13;
MATGENIE in accordance with the financial capacity of local investors. Both direct privatization&#13;
through sale of public participation in the entities, or privatization of management could be considered.&#13;
This option would also introduce an element of competition among the four entities. In addition, the&#13;
Government agreed to liberalize entry to the activity. The initial option recommended by the study&#13;
was to create a new company, the management of which would be privatized through a management&#13;
contract, and transform MATGENIE into a holding company. This option is being reviewed to&#13;
demonstrate its sustainability, which was unclear in the draft study.  Although liquidation of&#13;
MATGENIE and sale of the equipment was considered, the option was not retained as the road&#13;
maintenance organization and financing still need to be sustained before local investors can be expected&#13;
to invest in equipment rental, and supply the full equipment required for road maintenance. The new&#13;
set-up is expected to be implemented before the 1995 dry season and the start of the execution of the&#13;
road maintenance program.&#13;
66.   The number of items of equipment needed for the maintenance of the priority network is&#13;
estimated at 941. Depending on the capacity of private entrepreneurs to provide their own equipment,&#13;
the number of items of equipment to be provided by MATGENIE in the future ranges from 130 to&#13;
190.  The number of employees is estimated at 300, against 385 after the 1994 restructuring.&#13;
Currently, MATGENIE owns 734 items of equipment of which 33 percent are operational, 42 percent&#13;
need heavy repairs, and 25 percent should be scrapped.&#13;
67.   LABOGENIE.  A study is being carried out with EU financing to define the future legal&#13;
statute of LABOGENIE and the potential participation of private investors in the company. The study&#13;
will also review market conditions and propose a strategy to prevent the continuation of the current&#13;
monopoly by either a new private or public entity. A first breach was made in the monopoly when&#13;
LABOGENIE was authorized to participate in bids under EU-financed projects for the control of&#13;
works in association with only one of the consulting firms per short list.&#13;
68.   Port Activities. The Government is defining a new strategy for port operations. Two studies&#13;
are under preparation:&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(a)    to define an efficient organization to ensure sustainable performance of dredging. In&#13;
particular, the study will consider the privatization of the activity.  The study is&#13;
expected to be completed in June 1995, and the recommendations implemented before&#13;
the end of 1995.&#13;
(b)   to restructure the port authority to reduce operating costs, and to revise tariffs on the&#13;
basis of the analytical accounting recently implemented: The study will provide&#13;
recommendations regarding contractual relationships with private port operators which&#13;
need to be revised to provide investment incentives, and to encourage their&#13;
commitment to the development of Cameroonian ports.   Recommendations are&#13;
expected to be implemented before March 1996.&#13;
The two studies, and the implementation of the recommendations, are critical to improve port&#13;
performance. A decision also needs to be taken as part of the restructuring process, regarding the type&#13;
of management of the new container terminal built with OECF financing. IDA's strategy is that no&#13;
investment should be carried out in the port sector before the decisions on the dredging organization,&#13;
the port restructuring, and the management of the container terminal are implemented.&#13;
69.   Institutions. As mentioned above, MINTP's role would be to program, manage and supervise&#13;
road maintenance works, most of which will be contracted to private contractors. MINTP would&#13;
become autonomous in procurement decisions on maintenance works below a certain amount to ensure&#13;
efficient management of small and medium-size contractors for road maintenance. A PPF-financed&#13;
study is being carried out to prepare MINTP's shift toward this new role. Restructuring is expected to&#13;
be implemented before the end of 1995. MINT would focus on sector strategy, policy formulation and&#13;
transport regulation.   A  French-financed study is underway to prepare MINT  restructuring&#13;
accordingly. The restructuring will be implemented to accompany the privatization of transport PEs.&#13;
70.    Benefits Expected for the Transport Sector Reform.&#13;
(a)    Privatization and liquidation of priority public enterprises: After privatization, CAMAIR,&#13;
REGIFERCAM, CAMSHIP and CAMTAINER are expected to generate profits due to a&#13;
more autonomous and commercially-oriented management, cost-cutting, and financial&#13;
restructuring resulting in greater competitiveness. Subsidies should be stopped resulting in&#13;
savings for the Treasury. In addition, after privatization, the enterprises will generate&#13;
fiscal revenues which they have not done for several years. Financial forecasts indicate&#13;
that accumulated savings for the Treasury three years after privatization/liquidation&#13;
compared to the without privatization/liquidation scenario, would amount to US$60&#13;
million, and would be equivalent to the additional cost bome by the State for the&#13;
restructuring (see Schedule 17).&#13;
(b)    Road maintenance: Focusing MLNTP on planning, programming and budgeting,&#13;
supervising works and controlling objectives, and privatizing road maintenance execution&#13;
would make the road organization more efficient.  Such reorganization, and revised&#13;
procurement procedures, payment and financing mechanisms would improve road&#13;
maintenance sustainability. The rate of return of the maintenance program for the priority&#13;
network is estimated at above 200 percent on paved roads, and around 100 percent on&#13;
earth roads.&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(c)    Transit: The rehabilitation of the computerized customs declaration system in Douala&#13;
would improve customs revenues by reducing fraud.  The new procedures to be&#13;
implemented to accompany the rehabilitation would make the system more efficient, and&#13;
save time in the transit of goods through the port. Implementation of the transport&#13;
component of the UDEAC Program of Regional Reforms, including the TIPAC system,&#13;
would make transit procedures more efficient, and reduce the cost of non-factor services on&#13;
transit goods.&#13;
(d)    Port restructuring and rehabilitation: The objective of the restructuring is to reduce&#13;
ONPC's expenditures by about 30 percent. Tariffs would be adjusted accordingly.&#13;
Dredging reorganization would result in better efficiency and save waiting-time for the&#13;
ships entering the channel or leaving the port. Rehabilitation and maintenance of the&#13;
channel to a depth of 6.50 m would provide a 13 percent economic rate of return.&#13;
(e)    Regulatory framework: Progressive liberalization of maritime transport, simplification of&#13;
the road taxation system, revision of the transport component of the price structure for&#13;
petroleum products, as well as other measures mentioned above would result in a reduction&#13;
of transport costs and greater competitiveness of the country's economy. As an example,&#13;
in Cote d'Ivoire, liberalization of maritime transport for bananas cut prices of maritime&#13;
transport by half&#13;
71.   Implementation  of the Transport Sector Reform  Program.   The program  would be&#13;
implemented through a continuous process consisting of several phases defined in accordance with&#13;
priority issues and with the capacity of local resource mobilization. On the basis of the sector analysis,&#13;
the order of priority for the phases would be as follows:&#13;
(a)    Privatize/liquidate the transport sector PEs to reduce the drain on the State Treasury&#13;
caused by subsidies needed to cover their constant deficit.  Priority PEs to be&#13;
privatized or liquidated are the national airline, the railway company, the shipping line,&#13;
and the urban bus company because of the amount of subsidies that they need and/or&#13;
their inefficiency.  Revise the regulatory framework for air, maritime and urban&#13;
transport. Restructure MINT.&#13;
(b)    Improve the dredging of the access channel to the port of Douala and restructure the&#13;
port authority. Improve road maintenance management and execution. Restructure&#13;
MINTP. Improve the computerized customs information system and its environment.&#13;
(d)    Privatize MATGENIE and LABOGENIE. Implement further steps in the liberalization&#13;
process of maritime transport and revise the role of the Shippers' Council. Improve&#13;
transit transport facilitation. Privatize the dockyard.&#13;
(e)    Execute new investments.&#13;
Phase (a) would eliminate subsidies to PEs and free resources for subsequent financing of&#13;
infrastructure maintenance and investment.  Phase (b) would reduce the cost of transport for&#13;
international trade and increase Cameroon's competitiveness.   Phase (c) would strengthen the&#13;
sustainability of phases (a) and (b). Phase (d) would be implemented after sector restructuring is&#13;
completed. An implementation schedule is proposed in Schedule 19. It defines the steps to monitor&#13;
the progress in the implementation of the phases of the strategy which have been agreed by the&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Government, in the preparation of other phases for which an agreement is still sought, and in the&#13;
implementation of recommendations established during the preparation phase.&#13;
IV. Lessons Learned and Strategy for IDA Assistance to the Transport Sector in Cameroon&#13;
72.    Structural Adjustment.  Experience in PE restructuring under the Structural Adjustment&#13;
Program (SAP) underlines the importance of state divestiture from PEs in commercial sectors, and&#13;
implementing a satisfactory institutional framework to ensure such divestiture. Performance contracts&#13;
used to restructure PEs under the SAP failed because of a lack of commitment from both Government&#13;
and PEs. Privatization and liquidation operations launched at the same time also failed for the same&#13;
reason, and because of an unsatisfactory institutional framework (see paras. 12-13).&#13;
73.    Projects in the Transport Sector. Over the past 20 years, the Bank Group has contributed to&#13;
transport sector development in Cameroon, with 13 projects totaling US$500 million equivalent.&#13;
Projects were mostly in the highway (75 percent of the amount lent), railway, and port subsectors.&#13;
Ten projects were audited after completion.  Five transport sector memoranda provided the sector&#13;
analysis to prepare the projects.&#13;
74.    Although the audit reports observed that the Bank's objectives for the sector had been&#13;
"consistent, sound and transparent, improving efficiency and strengthening self-financing operations",&#13;
it concluded that while, generally, all physically measurable targets were successfully met, no&#13;
comparable success was registered in the areas of financial performance, maintenance activities, and&#13;
institution building. The audits attributed the poor institutional and financial performance of the&#13;
transport sector to the Government's lack of commitment to genuine change and, more importantly, to&#13;
the lack of a coherent sector program.  The audits underlined that the Bank had advocated a&#13;
comprehenisive program, and that its absence had meant that individual subsector operations were&#13;
neither integrated nor additive. The 1989 audit of the Feeder Roads, Highway IV, and Railway&#13;
projects concluded that an overall sectoral approach was overdue, and recommended preparation of an&#13;
action progranm pursuing a coherent approach of sector investment planning and PE reform, and the&#13;
adoption of this program by Government and donors as a basis for integrated sector financing.&#13;
75.    Transport Sector Reform Program. The lessons learned from past experience have led to IDA&#13;
contributing to the preparation of a Transport Sector Reform Program, described in the chapter above,&#13;
which places transport sector development and investment in a policy-based, sectorwide framework&#13;
supported by Government and donors. The preparation of this program is a critical contribution to&#13;
Cameroon's efforts to restore the performance of its economy and competitiveness. The Government&#13;
and IDA have carried out joint economic and sector work to analyze issues in the transport sector in&#13;
order to devise action plans and priorities to restore sector efficiency (Transport Sector Memorandum,&#13;
dated June 30, 1993, Report No. 11430-CM). The process for sector analysis, and the preparation of&#13;
the Transport Sector Reform Program, aimed at internalizing the rationale for reform and&#13;
recommendations by broadly involving Government institutions and staff, private operators and&#13;
donors. To marshal the necessary understanding and political commitment needed to implement the&#13;
proposed reforms, a Transport Interministerial Group was created to represent all Government&#13;
organizations involved in the transport sector. Several seminars were organized to discuss with the&#13;
private sector the reform  in the road maintenance, port, transit and maritime subsectors.  The&#13;
Government also called several donor meetings to discuss sector issues and proposed action plans. The&#13;
outcomes of these discussions are being reflected in a draft declaration of sector policy being prepared&#13;
as part of the preparation of subsequent IDA projects in the transport sector.&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76.   IDA's Assistance Strategy to the Transport Sector.  According to the priorities mentioned&#13;
above (para. 71), IDA would assist the Government in implementing phase (a) of the transport sector&#13;
reform program through the proposed Transport Sector Adjustment Credit (TSAC), scheduled for&#13;
FY96. As execution of the TSAC begins, IDA would participate with other donors in the Transport&#13;
Sector Project (TSP), scheduled for FY96 to assist the Government in implementing phases (b) and (c).&#13;
In addition to the support to the implementation of the elements of the transport sector reform included&#13;
in these two phases, TSP would support the execution of the road maintenance program, rehabilitation&#13;
of the access channel to the port of Douala, and rehabilitation of the computerized customs information&#13;
system. However, the content of the project needs to be reappraised to take into account the different&#13;
progress in the definition of the reform in phases (a) and (b) of the program. Reappraisal may result in&#13;
splitting TSP into subprojects to be implemented at different times.&#13;
V. Project Description&#13;
77.    Objectives. With the assistance of the proposed project, the Government intends to: (a) launch&#13;
the transport sector reform program which would result in the creation of a new private civil aviation&#13;
company, private operation of rail services, liquidation of the urban bus company, sale of public shares&#13;
in CAMSHIP and CAMTAINER, restructuring of MINT, and reform of the regulatory framework for&#13;
air, urban, and maritime transport; and (b) continue preparation of the sunsequent phases which would&#13;
result in: (i) restructuring of MINTP; execution by contract of most of the road maintenance work&#13;
program; and implementation of a pluri-annual programming system and a sustainable financing&#13;
mechanism  for road maintenance;  (ii) restructuring and down-sizing of the port authority;&#13;
implementation of an efficiency-driven organization for dredging; and (iii) improved customs&#13;
institutional framework, overhaul of customs computerized information system, and implementation of&#13;
a new international transit system. Expected results and timing for project activities, which will be&#13;
used as performance indicators for the project, are provided in Schedule 20.&#13;

(h)    Project management, auditing and accounting.&#13;
(i)    Provision of assistance to the Transport Interministerial Coordination Unit. The unit&#13;
was established in 1992. It has diligently helped the Government prepare the reform&#13;
program as secretariat of the Interministerial Committee created in this respect. The&#13;
assistance will include short-term missions of experts, local staff under contract, office&#13;
equipment, and mission expenditures.&#13;
80.    Technical Assistance, Training and Seminars. The credit would finance 495 person-months&#13;
of consulting services for policy support, support to institutional development, institutional&#13;
development studies, and support to project preparation and implementation (Table 2) at a cost of about&#13;
US$8.7 million. Consulting services would consist of studies (286 person-months) and short-term&#13;
missions (209 person-months), including services purchased for assisting the Government to privatize&#13;
or liquidate PEs.&#13;

81.    Terms of reference of most project activities were agreed during negotiations.   When&#13;
appropriate, they will be revised to indicate that transfer of know-how is expected in the core output,&#13;
and evaluation of consultants by the counterparts, and of the counterparts by consultants should be&#13;
made. Performance of consultants will be reviewed to determine how assignments' objectives were&#13;
achieved and how well consultants were able to transfer skills and know-how to their counterparts, and&#13;
to strengthen the local agencies to which they were assigned.&#13;
82.    During negotiations, the Government provided an assurance that counterparts would be&#13;
designated before the start of major consulting assignments, with qualifications and terms of reference&#13;
acceptable to IDA, and would remain in post until the completion of the activity. These counterparts&#13;
will be responsible for preparing seminars related to project activities and for presenting papers on the&#13;
c onclusions and recommendations of studies. Terms of reference will detail tasks to be carried out by&#13;
the counterpart staff as part of their training. Consultants' proposals should include the time necessary&#13;
to train counterparts during execution of studies, and the corresponding budget. This process has&#13;
already started under studies financed by PPF funds.&#13;
83.    The list of studies to be financed by the project was agreed at negotiations. It is provided in&#13;
Schedule 21. The list would be regularly reviewed and updated, if necessary in the course of Bank&#13;
supervision missions, and in light of studies' outcomes already known, and of developments in the&#13;
sector. Terms of reference of consulting activities will be included in the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
84.    Two seminars would be held on environmental considerations in road maintenance and on&#13;
urban transport institutions and liberalization.  Training would be provided on road maintenance&#13;
management (planning, budgeting, programming, procurement and supervision of road maintenance&#13;
works). FAC will finance a training program to be defined on transport-related activities. EU will&#13;
finance training for administrative and private users of the regional guarantee system of customs duties.&#13;
Studies included in the project will define training needs to be included in the proposed TSP. The&#13;
guidelines for preparing training activities were agreed during negotiations. Draft guidelines are&#13;
provided in Schedule 22.&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SECTION B: PROJECT COSTS AND ADMINISTRATION&#13;
I. Project Costs&#13;
85.   Total project costs, including price contingencies and taxes are estimated at US$23.9 million.&#13;
The costs, net of taxes and duties, are estimated at US$20.2 million with a foreign exchange&#13;
component of US$14.2 or 70 percent. The Government would bear the cost, estimated at US$3.7&#13;
million, of taxes and duties levied on consulting services and goods. The Government will also&#13;
finance the salary of the four civil servants working in the Transport Interministerial Coordination&#13;
Unit, estimated at US$ 16,000 per year, and provide offices for the unit. In the current budgetary&#13;
situation, where the Government is barely able to finance its civil servants, service the country's&#13;
external debt and allocate scarce remaining resources to priority maintenance, no other contribution to&#13;
the project would be requested from the Government. Detailed project costs are provided in Schedule&#13;

II. Procurement&#13;
Employment of Consultants&#13;
86.   In order to ensure the satisfactory execution of the project, the Borrower agreed during&#13;
negotiations that qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment of consultants&#13;
shall be satisfactory to IDA.  Such consultants will be selected in accordance with principles and&#13;
procedures satisfactory to IDA on the basis of the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency, published by the Bank Group in August 1981&#13;
(the Consultant Guidelines). Procurement procedures are indicated in Schedule 21. The model letter&#13;
of invitation issued by the Bank Group shall be used. For complex, time-based assignments, the&#13;
Borrower will employ such consultants under contracts, using the standard form of contract for&#13;
consultants' services issued by the Bank Group, with such modifications as shall have been agreed by&#13;
IDA. Where no relevant standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank Group, the&#13;
Borrower will use other forms agreed with IDA prior to launching the bids.&#13;
85.   Following the recommendations of the Country Procurement Assessment Report issued in&#13;
April 1994, which concluded that procurement practices in Cameroon were inadequate, and to enable a&#13;
satisfactory procurement process, the following measures were agreed during negotiations:&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(a)    Short-lists shall be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 firms with no more than two&#13;
firms from the same country.&#13;
(b)    The practice of requesting bid and performance securities shall be discontinued.&#13;
(c)    Quality shall be the main criterion for the selection of consultants.&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
87.   During negotiations, the following procedures were agreed. Goods estimated to cost the&#13;
equivalent of US$80,000 or less per contract, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to US$210,000,&#13;
may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally, in&#13;
accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA, including: (i) bids are opened in public in the presence&#13;
of bidders or their representatives; (ii) there will be no negotiation with bidders between bid opening&#13;
and contract award; (iii) bid evaluation and post-qualification criteria will be defined in precise&#13;
quantitative and monetary terms; and (iv) award will be made to the lowest evaluated responsive&#13;
bidder.&#13;
88.    Review by IDA of Procurement Decisions:&#13;
(a)    With respect to each contract estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more,&#13;
the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits published by the Bank in May 1992&#13;
shall apply. Where payments for such contracts are to be made out of a Special&#13;
Account, such procedures shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of&#13;
the contract, required to be furnished to IDA pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d), shall be&#13;
furnished to IDA prior to the making of the first payment out of such Special Account&#13;
in respect of such contract.&#13;
(b)    With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding paragraph, the procedures&#13;
set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where&#13;
payments for such contract are to be made out of a Special Account, said procedures&#13;
shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract, together with&#13;
the other information required to be furnished to IDA pursuant to said paragraph 3,&#13;
shall be furnished to IDA as part of the evidence to be furnished showing that such&#13;
payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.&#13;
(c)    The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall not apply to contracts on&#13;
account of which withdrawals are to be made on the basis of statements of expenditure.&#13;
89.   Modification of Waiver of the Terms and Conditions of Contracts. Before agreeing to any&#13;
material modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of a contract that would increase its cost by&#13;
more than 10 percent of the original price (10 percent would be specified for the purpose of para. 4 of&#13;
Appendix 1 to the Bank Group's Guidelines), the Borrower should specify the reasons thereof and seek&#13;
IDA's no objection for the proposed modification.&#13;
28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Procurement Times&#13;
90.    Procurement times for project activities up to contract signing were agreed during negotiations,&#13;
in particular all contracts must be signed within the original bid validity period.&#13;
III. Disbursements&#13;
91.    Schedule B details the amount to be disbursed from the credit per category. The percentage of&#13;
expenditures to be financed is 100 percent of the cost net of taxes and duties for consultants' services,&#13;
training and seminars, and operating costs, and 100 percent of the foreign expenditures and 75 percent&#13;
of the local expenditures for goods.&#13;
92.    To facilitate disbursements and to ensure that funds are available on time to finance the costs of&#13;
services to be provided under the project, the Government will establish a Special Account in a&#13;
commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The Special Account will be managed by&#13;
the Transport Interministerial Coordination Unit. The authorized amount of the Special Account is&#13;
CFAF 130 million; requests for replenishing the account will be submitted to IDA monthly or at such&#13;
intervals as IDA shall specify.&#13;
93.    Disbursements will be made against standard Bank documentation, except for contracts of less&#13;
than US$50,000 for consultants and goods, for which certified statements of expenditure would be&#13;
used. These statements of expenditure will be subject to review by supervision missions and periodic&#13;
financial audits. The minimum application size for payments directly from the credit account will be&#13;
US$50,000.&#13;
IV. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
94.    Accounting.  The Transport Interministerial Coordination Unit will maintain records and&#13;
accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources&#13;
and expenditures in respect of the Project. Accounting procedures are defined in a manual prepared by&#13;
the unit, to be part of the Project Implementation Plan (para. 98) and to be agreed by IDA. The&#13;
project includes financing for hiring a qualified accounting firm, acceptable to IDA, to establish a&#13;
computerized accounting system for the proposed TSP when required. Such system is not needed for&#13;
the present project because of the small number of contracts.&#13;
95.    Auditing. The signature of a three-year contract with the project auditors is a condition of&#13;
credit effectiveness. During negotiations, the Borrower agreed to:&#13;
(a)    have the records and accounts referred to in the preceding paragraph for each fiscal&#13;
year audited, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied,&#13;
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA;&#13;
(b)    furnish to IDA as soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the&#13;
end of each such year, a certified copy of the report of such audit by said auditors, of&#13;
such scope and in such detail as IDA shall have reasonably requested;&#13;
(c)    furnish to IDA such other information concerning said records and accounts and the&#13;
audit thereof as IDA shall from time to time reasonably request; and&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d)    without any limitation to the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) above, have the&#13;
records and accounts of the Special Account audited in accordance with paragraphs (a)&#13;
through (c) above: (i) every four months during the first twelve months after the&#13;
Effective Date; and (ii) every six months during the second twelve months after the&#13;
Effective Date; and furnish such audits to IDA at the latest within two months&#13;
following the end of the period audited.&#13;
96.    For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Credit Account were made on&#13;
the basis of statements of expenditure, the Borrower shall:&#13;
(a)    maintain or cause to be maintained, in accordance with paragraph 94, records and&#13;
accounts reflecting such expenditures;&#13;
(b)    retain, until at least one year after IDA has received the audit report for the fiscal year&#13;
in which the last withdrawal from the Credit Account or payment out of the Special&#13;
Account was made, all records (contracts, orders, invoices, bills, receipts and other&#13;
documents) evidencing such expenditures;&#13;
(c)    enable IDA's representatives to examine such records; and&#13;
(d)    have the records and accounts of the statements of expenditure audited in accordance&#13;
with paragraph 95 above: and ensure that the report of such audits contains a separate&#13;
opinion by said auditors as to whether the statements of expenditure submitted during&#13;
the period preceding such audit, together with the procedures and internal controls&#13;
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals.&#13;
30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SECTION C: IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING&#13;
I. Organization and Management&#13;
97.   The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for the privatization/liquidation&#13;
component of the project. MINT and MINTP will be responsible in their subsectors for preparing&#13;
subsequent phases of the reform program including investments, in consultation with other interested&#13;
Government agencies. The existing Transport Interministerial Coordination Unit which helped the&#13;
Government prepare the reform program, will continue to assist MINT and MINTP, and will manage&#13;
the credit under supervision of MINEFI.&#13;
98.   A Project Implementation Plan will be prepared to help the project coordinator implement and&#13;
monitor the project. The plan would include all project procedures agreed with IDA, standard bidding&#13;
documents for consultants, the list of consulting services to be procured and the type of procurement,&#13;
detailed project costs, the terms of reference of the studies and support services to be carried out, and&#13;
standard forms for progress reports. An outline of the Project Implementation Plan was agreed during&#13;
negotiations, and the plan should be completed as a condition of credit effectiveness. Most terms of&#13;
reference for critical project activities other than PPF-financed activities, have been agreed by the&#13;
Government (i.e., financial advisors for the privatization of REGIFERCAM, CAMAIR, CAMSHIP&#13;
and CAMTAINER, liquidator of SOTUC, and port studies). Letters of invitation, including terms of&#13;
reference, and short-lists for these activities are being reviewed by IDA.&#13;
II. Implementation Schedule&#13;
99.   The implementation schedule of the project was agreed during negotiations. It is provided in&#13;
Schedule 24. It was prepared on the assumption that the credit would become effective in May 1995.&#13;
The project would be executed over a 30-month period, and the credit would be closed by June 30,&#13;
1998.&#13;
III. Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
100.  The content and timing of progress reports were agreed during negotiations. A standard form&#13;
of progress report was prepared during appraisal and is available in project files. The final form&#13;
would be included in the Project Implementation Plan. Progress reports would be prepared quarterly&#13;
and in advance of each Bank supervision mission. The reports would review progress on financial&#13;
execution and studies. The Borrower would submit an Implementation Completion Report to IDA no&#13;
later than six months after the closing date of the credit.&#13;
31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. Supervision Plan&#13;
101.  Bank staff input into the supervision of the project would take the following form:&#13;
(a)    Portfolio management. Procurement documents, terms of reference and reports&#13;
(progress, final, studies, financial statements) would be reviewed at Bank headquarters.&#13;
(b)    Field supervision. Missions would review the progress of technical assistance and&#13;
studies in the three broad project areas of policy support, institutional development,&#13;
and project preparation and implementation. Missions would monitor the impact of&#13;
project activities and discuss action plans for implementing study recommendations.&#13;
102.  A supervision plan for the 1995-1998 Bank fiscal years is proposed in Schedule 25.&#13;
V. Mid-term Review&#13;
103.   Not later than November 30, 1996, the project coordinator in the Transport Interministerial&#13;
Coordination Unit should prepare and hold a mid-term review of the project execution. The review&#13;
would be organized in collaboration with the Administration, public enterprises, IDA's supervision&#13;
mission, and representatives of donor agencies involved in the transport sector. The review process&#13;
would include progress in meeting project's objectives, overall project performance against established&#13;
and agreed key performance indicators, implementation of study recommendations, and performance of&#13;
consultants under the Project. The mid-term review would provide the opportunity for IDA to assess&#13;
the Government's continued commitment to the project's objectives and the reform in the transport&#13;
sector. During negotiations, the Borrower agreed to the carrying-out of a mid-term review and to its&#13;
objectives.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON&#13;
TRANSPORT SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
Schedule 2: Maritime Transport Regulation and Development&#13;
in sub-Saharan African Countries'&#13;
Maritime Transport Regulation&#13;
1.    The creation of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in&#13;
1964 resulted in the sensitization of developing maritime nations (DMNs) to the impact on their&#13;
economic development of foreign dominance in their shipping trade. In 1974, DMNs succeeded&#13;
in persuading the United Nations General Assembly to adopt the United Nations Convention on a&#13;
Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences which was ratified and entered into force in 1983.&#13;
2.    The shipping policies adopted by most West and Central African countries are essentially&#13;
characterized by cargo reservation and flag discrimination. Typically, the policies empowered&#13;
these nations to ensure that liner conference cargo was shared on a 40-40-20 basis, i.e., 40&#13;
percent being transported by national shipping lines, 40 percent by shipping lines of the partner&#13;
countries, and 20 percent by outsiders. Although the Code of Conduct does not cover bulk and&#13;
non-conference cargo, most African countries apply the Code to such cargoes as well. Nigeria,&#13;
for example, reserves 50 percent of both liquid and dry bulk cargo and all non-conference cargo&#13;
to and from the country for Nigerian shipping lines. Other "flag-discrimination practices" include&#13;
the reservation of specific commodities (e.g., cocoa, cotton, bauxite) for national carriers. Other&#13;
countries have tried to exclude certain flags from their entire shipping trade.&#13;
3.    Indirect controls were implemented, which were detrimental to foreign shipping lines and&#13;
subsidized the operation of national carriers until such a time as they would be capable of&#13;
competing with foreign shipping lines on their own. These controls included currency regulations,&#13;
insistence on selling on C.I.F (Cost, Insurance, Freight) and buying on F.O.B. (Free on Board)&#13;
basis, the creation of freight bureaus to enforce the cargo sharing formula, the use of slot-charter&#13;
arrangements, discriminatory freight taxes, import license controls, and preshipment inspection.&#13;
4.    Shippers' councils were entrusted with the enforcement of the cargo sharing regulation.&#13;
They were given conflicting missions: (a) to encourage the development of national shipping lines,&#13;
one instrument being tariffs' increase; and (b) to protect the interests of shippers by assisting them&#13;
in their dealings with shipowners and by participating in freight rates negotiations to resist the&#13;
continuous increase practiced by shipping conferences in the early 1970s.&#13;
5.    These policies have failed to develop African shipping lines. Most of the companies have&#13;
gone bankrupt and have disappeared, or sold their traffic rights to the foreign shipping lines, for&#13;
whose replacement they were created. The profits from such sales range from between 10 to 20&#13;
percent of the freight value. The only shipping lines that continue to operate their own vessels or&#13;
charter vessels are in Nigeria, C6te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon and Togo. Reasons for failure are&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
poor productivity, high operating costs, overstaffing, weak management, and interference from&#13;
the State.&#13;
Recent Development&#13;
6.    The structure and organization of the shipping trade in West and Central Africa are&#13;
changing from near-control by maritime conferences for more than 75 years to their near&#13;
disappearance, the development of independent shipping lines and the concentration of the&#13;
industry in maritime consortia. Conferences started to dismantle in 1992 when two major&#13;
European shipping lines withdrew membership following fines imposed on them by the European&#13;
Community for allegedly engaging in price-fixing and unfair trading practices. Independent lines&#13;
developed because they were able to adapt quickly to the changing technology while conference&#13;
shipping lines had to rationalize their services. Following their withdrawal from conferences,&#13;
shipping lines embarked in a merging program which is resulting in the creation of three major&#13;
consortia operating in West and Central Africa.&#13;
7.    European Union. The maritime legislation in West Africa has been the object of&#13;
substantial criticism by the European Union (EU). This is because effective implementation of the&#13;
Liner Code requires bilateral agreements to ensure that the shipping companies of the importing&#13;
and exporting countries obtain their 40 percent share. The EU considers that such bilateral&#13;
agreements result into unequal treatment between EU shipping lines. For example, a Belgian&#13;
conference member would only be able to compete for 20 percent of the traffic between France&#13;
and C6te d'Ivoire , which is not allowed under the Treaty of Rome. Consequently, in 1986, the&#13;
EU issued a Regulation calling on Member States to annul their bilateral agreements, which were&#13;
to be replaced, if at all, by agreements granting shipping lines of all Member States to compete&#13;
for the 40 percent of traffic to which they each lay claim under the Liner Code of Conduct (so-&#13;
called 'bommunitarisation" of traffic rights). In addition, in 1991, the EU issued heavy fines&#13;
against a number of European Lines for having participated in restrictive practices in their West&#13;
Africa -- Europe trade. As a result, these lines have now left the conference.&#13;
8.    Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program. Maritime transport regulation and&#13;
development were discussed during a Round Table organized in Cotonou (Benin) in 1992. The&#13;
Round Table was attended by almost all West and Central African countries, donors and the&#13;
major shipping lines. It recommended that six studies be carried out. These studies are expected&#13;
to be completed in 1995 under the umbrella of the Trade and Transport component of the Sub-&#13;
Saharan  Africa Transport Policy  Program  (SSATP), coordinated  by  a committee  of&#13;
representatives of the main financing agencies, the Economic Commission for Africa (United&#13;
Nations) and the World Bank:&#13;
(a)   New Maritime Transport Policy: This study aims at establishing a new policy to&#13;
facilitate structural and technological change in maritime transport in the sub-&#13;
region, taking into account the statutory obstacles to the establishment of a&#13;
regional framework enabling economic operators to contribute to the development&#13;
of transport services in the sub-region as a whole, and improve interstate&#13;
cooperation.  The study will also include an analysis of the restriction on&#13;
35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
investments in the transport chain, and propose a framework to facilitate&#13;
investments and joint-ventures at the regional level.&#13;
(b)    Audit of the Ministerial Conference of the West and Central African States on&#13;
Shipping: This study will evaluate the organization and its objectives, as well as&#13;
capabilities of the sub-regional agencies responsible for inter-state cooperation in&#13;
the area of maritime transport and ports in West and Central Africa.&#13;
(c)    Comparison of the Costs of International Chains of Transport: The study will&#13;
analyze the impact of the costs of the transport chains on the competitiveness of&#13;
principal export products of the region.&#13;
(d)   Maritime Transport Data Bank/Transport Monitoring System: The objective is to&#13;
develop such a bank/system at the national and sub-regional levels.&#13;
(e)    Redefinition of the Role of Shippers' Councils: This study will assess the missions&#13;
of the shippers' councils, with a view to improving their services to users, including&#13;
an analysis of constraints and options.&#13;
(f)    National Shipping Lines: This study will assess, within a regional framework,&#13;
national shipping lines, and draft options for their viability.&#13;
(g)   Transport Facilitation Plans: This study will examine the status of transport&#13;
facilitation and prepare plans of action in coordination with UNCTAD's sub-&#13;
regional programs.&#13;
(h)    Human Resource Management: This study will define measures and provide&#13;
training to strengthen human resource management as well as basic education to&#13;
facilitate adaptation of personnel to the changing maritime environment.&#13;
9.    Maritime transport in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal. In the context of recent Bank&#13;
adjustment operations, Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal have undertaken reforms of their maritime&#13;
transport legislation to bring it more into line with the UNCTAD Code of Conduct of which they&#13;
are signatories. In both countries, as of March 1, cargo sharing will be applied only to companies&#13;
that are members of conferences in accordance with the dispositions of the Code. Hence,&#13;
outsiders -- that is companies that are not conference members -- will be able to load import and&#13;
export cargoes without prior authorization of shippers' councils.&#13;
10.   At the same time, restrictions with respect to bulk transport are also being liberalized.&#13;
Restrictive legislation has been a problem in Cote d'Ivoire where SITRAM, the state-owned&#13;
shipping company, has had an exclusivity with regard to certain categories of bulk and&#13;
refrigerated traffic, notably bananas, pineapples, wheat, etc. This exclusivity has now been&#13;
reduced to 50 percent, as a first step towards full liberalization.&#13;

Schedule 4: CAMAIR - A Company Profile&#13;
The Company&#13;
I.    Cameroon Airlines (CAMAIR) is a corporation (Socitet Anonyme). Its main stockholder is the&#13;
Cameroon Government (75%). The remainder being owned by Air France. It has a capital of CFAF 5.250&#13;
million (US$9.5 million), although its negative net worth is around CFAF 11,000 million (US$20 million). In&#13;
1993, it was operating four aircraft (one 747-200 Combi, and three 737-200), with a staff of about 1,600&#13;
employees. It carried about 350,000 passengers, half of them on its domestic network, and generated a&#13;
turnover of about CFAF 32,542 million (US$59 million).&#13;
Current Situation&#13;
2.     Since its inception in 1971, when Cameroon left Air Afrique, CAMAIR has continuously generated&#13;
losses. Inadequate structure, along with a very thin market have been the major reasons (inadequate fleet,&#13;
insufficient capital, overstaffing of up to 2,150 employees, etc.), but significant management errors and&#13;
Government interference have also heavily contributed to its poor performance. A few actions have been&#13;
taken but have remained insufficient to remedy the situation. The attempted restructuring of the airline in&#13;
1990 through a Performance Contract under the SAL had very limited success. In fact, in depth structural&#13;
actions have not been taken while the airline still faces Government interference within its day-to-day&#13;
operations. As a consequence, the airline permanently shows annual losses of about 20% of its tumover,&#13;
while it is still over-staffed by 50%, and while its situation may even further deteriorate after the CFAF&#13;
devaluation. Furthermore, the airline will soon have to replace its aging fleet (principally, its two 737s which&#13;
are 22 years-old, the other 737 having been acquired in 1985, and the 747 in 1981).&#13;

Schedule 5: REGIFERCAM - A Company Profile&#13;
The Company&#13;
1.    Institutional and Economic Framework.  REGIFERCAM  is a public corporation functioning&#13;
under special Government regulations last modified in 1991. Rail infrastructure is owned by the State, but&#13;
REGIFERCAM is responsible for maintenance and renewal. Regulations specify that REGIFERCAM&#13;
operates on a commercial basis, in active competition with other modes of transport, and freely determines&#13;
configuration and tariffs. Deficits caused by passenger rail services operated under a Public Service&#13;
Obligation (PSO) are compensated by Government.  Goods transportation accounts for 70%  of&#13;
REGIFERCAMs revenue, where rail transportation maintains a competitive advantage over road&#13;
transportation for petroleum products, containers, cereals, and part of the traffic of land-locked Chad.&#13;
Passenger rail service is not competitive with road transport, which uses more economical, high capacity&#13;
intercity buses.&#13;
2.    Rail Facilities and Equipment. Two railway lines exist, of which a single-track line of 913 km&#13;
from Douala to Ngaounder&amp;, which is active for both passenger and freight traffic, and a line of 160 km&#13;
from Douala to Nkongsamba, which is marginal. Rolling stock is adequate, although there is a backlog of&#13;
maintenance. The track is generally in good condition, but the telecommunications system is inadequate&#13;
and needs updating.&#13;
3.    Management. The technical and operation management of REGIFERCAM is quite satisfactory;&#13;
financial management is weak. REGIFERCAM has signed a Performance Contract wvith the Government&#13;
for the FY89-FY93 period. Traffic forecasts on which the contract was based did not materialize, mainly&#13;
due to the depressed macroeconomic situation. Financial objectives of the contract were not reached. A&#13;
staff rationalization program was includcd in the contract, and has been fully implemented. Total staff was&#13;
reduced from 6350 in 1989, to 3800 at present, but the ratio of staff costs to revenue (44%) is still too&#13;
high, and the staff should be brought down to about 3000, about 35% of revenue.&#13;
Recommended Action&#13;
4.    Restructuring. The current Performance Contract of REGIFERCAM  has not resulted in the&#13;
expected efficiently gains, as costs have not been controlled adequately allowing the wage bill to remain&#13;
high while revenue declined. REGIFERCAM should therefore be restructured along the following lines:&#13;
rail transport services would be managed and operated by a private operator, through a concession&#13;
agreement. The concession agreement would allow the private operator full freedom to determine service&#13;
configuration and tariffs, lower operating costs, maintain equipment and infrastructure and use its own&#13;
procurement methods. REGIFERCAM would be transformed in a holding company and own all&#13;
infrastructure, part of the rolling stock, which would be leased to the operating company at market rates.&#13;
REGIFERCAM would charge a flat fee to the private operator for the right to operate the transport&#13;
services. REGIFERCAM would continue to service existing debts and arrears, and proceed with staff&#13;
reductions with the exception of those retained by the private operator.&#13;

5.     REGIFERCAM's capital is seriously depleted, and the company relies entirely for its long term&#13;
financing on borrowings, subsidies, arrears on long-term debt, banks and creditors. Working capital is in&#13;
chronic deficit, and the situation is deteriorating. Currently, REGIFERCAM does not have access to new&#13;

6.     REGIFERCAM's cash-flow for 1993 was barely sufficient to cover operational costs, but did not&#13;
cover depreciation and debt servicing. In spite of an adequate regulatory frarnework, revenue has been&#13;
dcclining because of competition from the road sector and the downturn of the economy in Cameroon.&#13;
Production costs are high due to the high wage bill (44% of revenue), and debt servicing (1 I% of revenue).&#13;

Schedule 6: SOTUC - A Company Profile&#13;
The Company&#13;
1.    SOTUC is a mixed ownership (Societe d'Economie Mixte) company: 55% is owned by the&#13;
government, with Renault Whicules Industriels (RVI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Renault of France,&#13;
(21 % of the shares), and the two cities of Yaounde and Douala (12% each) being the other shareholders.&#13;
The company employs 1,050 people and operates a total fleet of 190 buses in Yaounde and Douala.&#13;
Current Situation&#13;
2.    The company isfinancially bankrupt. 1992/93, the company made a loss of CFAF 3,962 million&#13;
(US$7.2 million at post-devaluation exchange rates) on revenues of CFAF 2,296 million. At the end of&#13;
FY1992/93, its negative net worth was CFAF 30,904 million (US$55.8 million) against a balance sheet&#13;
total of CFAF 6,774 million. CFAF 22,363 million (US$40.7 million) of debt are in arrears, including&#13;
debt to the local commercial banks and payments to CNPS, the state pension fund, which has sued the&#13;
company for recovery of its claims. The personnel has not been paid since January 1993. The company&#13;
has operated without any liability insurance since 1988, being unable to pay insurance premiums.&#13;
3.    Its role as provider of a public service has eroded in the face of increasing competition from&#13;
private taxis. The number of passengers transported has declined from 152,000 in 1986, to 44,000 in&#13;
1991. The market share of the company is now estimated at less than 5%, as 35 to 40% of the urban&#13;
population walk to work.&#13;
4.    Since 1989, successive restructuring plans have failed. Various measures were taken as part of&#13;
those plans, including personnel reduction, tariff reforms, acquisition of new equipment, signing of&#13;
performance contracts, restructuring of the debt, involvement of a technical consultant in the management.&#13;
In spite of all these measures, the company has continued to generate substantial losses and to be&#13;
increasingly short of cash.&#13;
5.     The company has no cash to pay for the maintenance of its equipment. It is estimated that it&#13;
performs only 10% of what would be required for normal maintenance. Buses that break down can not be&#13;
repaired and are "cannibalized" to supply spare parts to the buses which still run. At the current rate of&#13;
depletion of the bus fleet, it is estimated that the company will have to cease operations in 3 years for lack&#13;
of equipment.&#13;
Recommended Action&#13;
6.    The immediate liquidation of the enterprise is the only viable solution. An outright privatization&#13;
of the company is unrealistic as most bus routes cannot be run profitably with the type of equipment now&#13;
being used. On the basis of a thorough analysis of the situation and market by Bank consultants, it is&#13;
recommended to grant concessions to private operators for the most profitable bus routes, sell some of the&#13;
buses to them through competitive bidding, and sell the remaining buses through intemational bidding to&#13;
potential private or public buyers in the region. The concession for other bus routes for which the buses&#13;
are not suitable should be granted to private operators who will then use minibuses. A traffic plan study to&#13;
confirm urban transport demand will also be carried out.&#13;

I1.         Depreciation accounts for 32 per cent of revenues.  In 1993, salaries&#13;
accounted for 33 per cent of revenues and had increased for the first time since 87/88. In&#13;
1994, salaries had decreased by 6 percent and accounted for 24 percent of revenues.&#13;
2.    The financial ratios are analyzed hereafter:&#13;
(a)    Solvency and financial autonomy are sound. The long-term debt to equity&#13;
ratio is correct in comparison of a maximum acceptable ratio of 0.5. The&#13;
current ratio allows for contracting additional long-term debt.&#13;
(b)   The return on equity is very low, but this is not an important factor for a&#13;
port. The cash-flow seems sufficient.&#13;
(c)   The operating profit ranges between 43 and 54 percent of revenues, which&#13;
is enough because of the significant percentage required for depreciation of&#13;
assets.&#13;
(d)   The interest coverage ratio ranges between 3 and 3.5 and should increase.&#13;

Schedule 10: CNIC - A Company Profile&#13;
1.    The dockyard uses one 10,000-ton and two smaller (500 tons and 1,000 tons) dry-yards.&#13;
The 10,000-ton dry-yard was purchased in 1988. The other two are much older. The 10,000 ton&#13;
dry-yard is located along berth nb. 14 in the Douala port container terminal, at 3.7 km from the&#13;
workshop.  CNIC is owned 30 percent by foreign private investors and 70 percent by&#13;
Cameroonian public enterprises:&#13;
(a)   ONPC, the national port authority: 20%;&#13;
(b)   SNI, the State holding company: 15%;&#13;
(c)   SNH, the national petroleum company: 10%;&#13;
(d)   CNCC, the shippers' council: 10%; and&#13;
(e)   CAMSHIP, the national shipping line: 10%.&#13;
2.    Before devaluation, the return on the dockyard activity was estimated at about 15 percent,&#13;
which is insufficient in view of the assets placed at its disposal almost free of charge. These assets&#13;
include the US$1 1 million dry-yard, the workshop and the use of a berth in the port of Douala for&#13;
about US$50,000 per year). CNIC is seeking Government's financing for the relocation of the&#13;
dock, including the construction of a new berth and dredging, and for the rehabilitation of the&#13;
workshop. The cost of these investments is estimated at above US$10 million. The return after&#13;
investment would drop to 10 percent. After devaluation, CNIC became more competitive and its&#13;
revenues increased. Thus, the return of the activity is expected to be higher than the above&#13;
estimates. CNIC competes with Abidjan, C6te d'Ivoire, and Capetown, South Africa, both at&#13;
about 3,000 km from Douala. The market consists of petroleum offshore companies and local or&#13;
regional shipowners.&#13;

Schedule 14: Strategy, Timetable and Key Financial Data for the Privatization of Air Services&#13;
I. STRATEGY&#13;
1.    The Government of Cameroon (GOC) is planning to restructure and privatize the national flag&#13;
carrier (CAMAIR), in order to achieve the following objectives: (a) make domestic and international air&#13;
transport service more efficient; (b) reduce government involvement; and (c) promote private sector&#13;
participation in the aviation industry. Given the present difficulties of Camair's financial situation, together&#13;
with the need for the continuation of the provision of air transport services by a national flag carrier, the&#13;
GOC is considering a two-fold strategy: (i) the legal and financial restructuring of CAMAIR, and (ii) the&#13;
privatization of a restructured CAMAIR. For the privatization strategy, the GOC will explore the use of&#13;
innovative mechanisms for attracting foreign investors, such as the capitalization of the company, the use of&#13;
a management contract (MC) with deferred privatization options (DPO), or any other mechanism that could&#13;
attain the desired objectives.&#13;
A. Background&#13;
4.     Cameroon Airlines (CAMAIR) is a corporation under the Cameroonian civil legislation (Societe&#13;
Anonyme) created by Law No. 71/LF/4 on June 4, 1971. The airline has currently the following ownership&#13;
structure: (i) The GOC holds 75 %, and (ii) Air France holds the remaining shares'. The airline operates five&#13;
aircrafts: (a) one B-747-200 combi (1981), (b) two B-737-200 (1972), (c) one B-737-200 (1985), and (d)&#13;
one Dash - 8 (1986). Following is the distribution and structure of its traffic markets during the period&#13;
1993/94 (June 30 to July 01):&#13;

5. Since its origin in 1971, when Cameroon left Air Afrique (joint venture airline between several African&#13;
countries), the company has suffered from an inadequate structure (i.e., inadequate fleet and route structure,&#13;
insufficient working capital, overstaffing, etc.) that has contributed to a poor financial performance.&#13;
Government interference, admninistrative malpractices and management errors have added difficulties to&#13;
successful achievements in the airline operations. Estimated debt and arrears as of June 30, 1994, were CFA&#13;
42,100 nillions (equivaleiit to approx. US$77.0 million). Of this total, approximately 70 to 75 % is related&#13;
to government agencies2 (CNPS - social security and pensions, ASECNA C - airport and air navigation&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
authority, tax authorities, etc.).  The market value of the aviation related assets3 was estimated at&#13;
approximately US$50 million in 1993. The labor force consists of 1612 employees (down from 2105 in&#13;
1992), and it is estimated that with a total of 900 employees, the airline could be run as efficiently at present.&#13;
Under present circumstances (status quo scenanro - no change), operating and financial losses of the airline&#13;
are estimated to be between US$8.0 and 10.0 million per year.&#13;
Table 2: Strengths and weaknesses of CAMAIR&#13;
Strengths                                      Weaknesses&#13;
1. Aviation related assets are fully paid.      1. Total debt and arrears are approx. US$77&#13;
million&#13;
2. Exclusive traffic rights to 38 countries. Only 15 2. Non attractive domestic market (airfares are&#13;
been used at present.                           regulated and there is a need to service social&#13;
routes - Northbound markets)&#13;
3. Relatively low cost labor force. Government 3. Overstaffing  and high  termination  benefits&#13;
willingness to help in the reduction of employees agreement under the 1990 performance contract.&#13;
(1612 to 900).&#13;
4. High costs maintenance overhaul (D checks) 4. Lack of adequate Management Information&#13;
have being made to the aircrafls. Next D checks Systems  (i.e.,  accounting,  inventory,  yield&#13;
are planned for 1999.                           management, treasury, etc.)&#13;
5. Attractive Regional markets (Africa) with 5. Past experience of administrative malpractices&#13;
relatively weak competition.                    (ticket collection, free fares, etc.)&#13;
6. Possibility of developing a B-737 regional 6. Low utilization rate  (operations hours/block&#13;
maintenance center (provide services to other hours) of the B-747-200.&#13;
airlines)  _&#13;
7. Aircraft well-maintained under ATLAS, Air 7. Poor passenger terminal facilities at Douala&#13;
France standards                                (main commercial market in Cameroon).&#13;
8. GOC decision to solve Camair's government 8. Cameroon traffic market has not yet recovered&#13;
related   debt  and  implement  restructuring from last CFA devaluation (January 1994)&#13;
mechanisms that eliminates interference with day&#13;
to day operations.&#13;
B. The Proposed concept for the Restructuring and Privatization of CAMAIR&#13;
6.2. Conceptualframework of the restructuring/privatization proposal.&#13;
Basic premise (hypothesis): Given Camair's present condition (i.e., negative net worth, lack of&#13;
information systems, lack of availability to audited financial statements and relevant accounts,&#13;
overstaffing, etc.), and the situation of the African airline market (i.e., region with the slowest&#13;
growth potential in the ICAO/IATA forecasts), the GOC considers it unrealistic to expect the&#13;
privatization of CAMAIR as it is, through a public bidding process. Therefore, a restructuring&#13;
process will be initially used before successful implementation of the privatization strategy4.&#13;
Principles:&#13;
Separate the issue of the settlement of past debt and arrears from the air transport operations&#13;
(continuity of domestic and international services).&#13;
Improve airline operations management and increase the productivity ratios of the company (ASK5&#13;
per employee, RPK6 per employee, yicld, etc.). Reduce the operating losses, trim the labor force,&#13;
3Aircraft and other aviation-related equipment arefully owned (and depreciated) by CAMAIR. There are no debt or lease related obligations with&#13;
the aircraft.&#13;
4However, privatizing CAMAIR as it is (without restructuring) will be a preferred option, ifpossible.&#13;
5ASK (average seat kilometer)&#13;
56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
open new routes in the regional markets, abandon unprofitable routes, and start generating profits in a&#13;
given period (e.g., 24 months).&#13;
Privatize through an international bidding process, a controlling block of shares of a restructured&#13;
CAMAIR (legal and financially). Preferably, the controlling interest should be sold to a consortium&#13;
representing private Cameroonian interests and a major regional and/or international carrier.&#13;
6.3    Proposed Strategy for the restructuring and privatization of CAMAIR.&#13;
Complete the legal and financial restructuring of CAMAIR. Privatize the management and ownership of the&#13;
restructured airline through the use of the following options (one of them or a combination of both): (a)&#13;
immediate capitalization of the airline by a group of private investors with full management control of the&#13;
company (management and immediate ownership); or (b) use of a management contract, with deferred&#13;
privatization options as a mechanism to improve the airline's performance and generate private sector&#13;
involvement (management and subsequently ownership).&#13;
Phase 1:&#13;
6.4 Legal andfinancial restructuring of CAMAIR.&#13;
(a) Creation of a new commercial company (e.g., CAMAIR 11) to provide air transport services to Cameroon&#13;
under an operational agreement (i.e., concession or license on traffic rights, lease of office space and&#13;
maintenance facilities, etc.) with CAMAIR (and/or the GOC). CAMAIR 1I will be initially incorporated with&#13;
a relatively low paid-in capital (step 1), as a new company under the ownership of Ministry of Finance.&#13;
Aviation related assets and traffic rights will be transferred to CAMAIR 11 in order to continue the provision&#13;
of air transport services to Cameroon. The transfer of aircraft-related assets wvill be done through a capital&#13;
increase (i.e., capitalization of CAMAIR 11, step 2) in order to provide the new company with the necessary&#13;
equity base to develop operations and access working capital finance.&#13;
(b) Isolation of CAMAIR from the operational aspects of air transport services (i.e. liquidation process). A&#13;
senior officer', with relevant experience (i.e., the liquidator of CAMAIR), will receive a mandate from&#13;
Camnair's general assembly to negotiate, restructure, transfer or cancel existing debt and arrears. The mandate&#13;
will also include the termination of redundant staff, and the divestiture of unprofitable assets.  It will be&#13;
executed in a given period of time (e.g., one to two years). During the restructuring period of CAMAIR (i.e.,&#13;
from one month to 24 months), the GOC, together with an advisory team (i.e., legal advisors and financial&#13;
advisors) will prepare the privatization of the airline operations according to the following steps:&#13;
(a) Transfer the aviation related assets and traffic rights to CAMAIR If and proceed with the&#13;
dissolution of CAMAIR. Appropriate legal mechanisms will have to be implemented for the&#13;
transfer of traffic rights, in order to minimize the consultation process with each signing country&#13;
in Cameroon's bilaterals.&#13;
(b) Terminate Camair's employees. Approximately 900 employees will be rehired by CAMAIR 11&#13;
(for these employees an employec stock ownership program - ESOP - will be developed based on&#13;
the use of their termination benefits). The remaining 700 employees will be laid off and their&#13;
termination benefits paid. The GOC intends to apply a labor restructuring process similar to the&#13;
one used for the liquidation of the Airport Authority of Cameroon and the creation of a new&#13;
corporation, AMroports du Cameroun.&#13;
6RPK (revenue passenger kilometer)&#13;

(c) Establish the "fair value" of CAMAIR 11 in order to determine the price of the shares to be&#13;
privatized. Equity participation to be sold to a private consortium formed by Cameroonian&#13;
private investors and the strategic partner (major regional and/or intemational carrier -&#13;
management contractor). Given the need of CAMAIR 11 to maintain Cameroonian nationality&#13;
(5 1%), and the reduction of public sector participation, a group  representing  private&#13;
Cameroonian interest would be needed to implement the strategy.&#13;

Phase II:&#13;
6.5    Option (a): Privatization of CAMAIR II through a capitalization strategv. Subscription of a capital&#13;
increase in the equity of CAMAIR II by a group of strategic investors (i.e. the consortium). Using the&#13;
illustration figures from Table 3, if the strategic group were to subscribe 50 % of CAMAIR II equity, the&#13;
required amount would be US$20.0 million. This option has the following advantages: (i) it generates&#13;
private sector participation immediately after the restructuring phase, (ii) if the amount subscribed by the&#13;
strategic investor is 50% or more, it would automatically provide the management control to the new&#13;
investors (i.e., in principle, no management contract will be needed under this scenario), (iii) prospective&#13;
investors will be more willing to inject capital in a company that they will be controlling (i.e., capitalization),&#13;
than a cash disbursement to the GOC through the acquisition of existing shares in CAMAIR II, and (iv) it&#13;
would provide CAMAIR II with needed working capital for the improvement of operations (i.e., infornation&#13;
management systems, aircraft upgrades, etc.).&#13;
In order to increase the attractiveness of the transaction (i.e., capital increase) to the prospective investors,&#13;
contributions other than cash could be considered for the equity subscription. Payment in kind, for the&#13;
58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
subscription of capital, such as the use of airline related assets (i.e., aircraft, equipment, etc.), airline-related&#13;
services (i.e., reservation systems, yield management systems, ground handling services, etc.), and the&#13;
provision of management services would facilitate the flow of foreign investment.&#13;
6.6. Option (b): Privatization of CAMAIR II through the use of a Management Contract (with deferred&#13;
privatization options).&#13;
Development of a management contract (MC) for the air transport operation of CAMAIR II for an initial&#13;
pre-determined period (e.g., 24 months). The MC would have the following features:&#13;
Base management contract with performance and evaluation criteria as well as incentive&#13;
mechanisms. The main objective of the MC will be to improve the productivity and profitability&#13;
ratios (reduce operational losses and generate profit) of the airline operation. The MC will be&#13;
targeted to select private contractors with expertise in the industry, and preferably in the Africa&#13;
Region (i.e., international or regional air carriers - strategic partner). The management team will de&#13;
facto have the potential to become future shareholder of CAMAIR II.&#13;
Deferred privatization options. The MC will additionally include privatization options such as:&#13;
(i) Purchase option for a given number of shares (i.e. see Table 4) in CAMAIR II at a pre-&#13;
determined value (or price formula). This price formula would be based on a technical and&#13;
accounting audit of the net assets to be transferred to CAMAIR 11 (i.e., audit by a recognized&#13;
international firm). The price formula and corresponding share values will be developed by the&#13;
Financial Advisor in coordination with the GOC. The option would expire at the end of the pre-&#13;
determined period, but it could be exercised at any moment during such period.&#13;
(ii) Use of profit sharing mechanisms against the value of a share at a future conversion date. The&#13;
incentives in the MC should be linked to profit generation (loss reduction). Instead of paying cash to&#13;
the management team for the profit sharing bonus, the payment could be made in kind (shares) as&#13;
part of the purchase option participation.&#13;
(iii)Right offirst refusal in the event of an offer to purchase a controlling interest by a third party,&#13;
during the life of the MC, on the remaining shares not included in the initial purchase option.&#13;
Initial subscription of capital. An initial percentage of CAMAIR II equity could be subscribed by&#13;
the management contractor (i.e., management team), in order to provide working capital to the new&#13;
company through an equity increase, therefore having a participation in CAMAIR II from the start&#13;
of operations. This feature could also be used to develop an objective selection criteria among&#13;
prospective bidders (i.e., management contractors), by allowing the amount of initial capital for a&#13;
subscription to be determined by the bidder (e.g., minimum of 5% to a maximum of 50%). The&#13;
highest initial capital increase offered by any given contractor will become the winning bid. The use&#13;
of this mechanism will contribute to a more expeditious privatization of the restructured airline'.&#13;
The use of this type of MC (MC + deferred privatization options), could provide strategic partners (air&#13;
carriers) with a low-cost and low-risk altemative to explore the business opportunity of the airline operation&#13;
in Cameroon. The contractor (management team) will have the opportunity to manage the airline operation&#13;
(i.e., restructure routes, improve ratios, train personnel, etc.), before making an important investment&#13;
commitment. The GOC will benefit from an air transport service run by an experienced management team&#13;
In theory, a 50% initial subscription by the MC will eliminate the need to use deferred privatization options, thus privatizing CAMAIR IIfrom the&#13;
start of operations. Given the airline tndustry situation, and the economic conditions of Cameroon. this option could be difficult to implement in&#13;
the beginning. but will, nevertheless, be preferable to any deferred option.&#13;
59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(that has the additional incentive of future ownership), and by concentrating its efforts on the settlement of&#13;
debt and arrears, the reduction of labor force, and divestiture of unprofitable assets in CAMAIR.&#13;
Table 5 illustrates a sample restructuring plan for the airline operations in Cameroon, which could be used as&#13;
an indication for the development of the Base management contract.&#13;

Privatization Process.&#13;
6.7. Option (a): Capitalization strategy&#13;
The award of the equity increase subscription in CAMAIR II will be done through an international bidding&#13;
process with public announcements. The bidding criteria will be developed by a Financial Advisor in&#13;
coordination with the GOC. Criteria such as the following could be used for the award process: (i) highest&#13;
bid for the capital subscription (e.g., base price + premium), (ii) bid with the highest % of cash contribution,&#13;
etc. The consortium (para. 6.3.b) should be structured previous to the award of the equity subscription.&#13;
6.8 Option (b): Management Contract + DPO&#13;
The award of the MC + deferred privatization options will be done through an international bidding process&#13;
with public announcements. The bidding criteria will be developed by a Financial Advisor in coordination&#13;
with the GOC. Criteria such as the following could be used for the award process: (i) premium to be paid&#13;
over the recommended base price (price formula), (ii) level of economic incentives proposed in the MC, (iii)&#13;
initial equity increase subscription through the contribution in kind to the equity of CAMAIR 11 (i.e., aviation&#13;
related assets and/or services). De facto, the award of the MC + deferred privatization option will be an&#13;
advance sale of a controlling participation in CAMAIR 11. The consortium (para. 6.3.b) could be structured&#13;
previous to the award of the MC and/or during the restructuring period9.&#13;
Conversion of the purchase option (in the MC) into ownership during the pre-deternined period by the&#13;
selected management contractor (and/or consortium). In case the purchase option is not exercised by the&#13;
contractor, the GOC would then proceed to privatize through open bidding for a restructured CAMAIR&#13;
(CAMAIR II).&#13;
9To be determfned by the FnancialAdvisor in coordination wfth the GOC prior to the award process.&#13;
60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In the event that no bidders are interested in CAMAIR II, other divestiture strategies will have to be&#13;
developed and implemented (i.e., liquidation of the company, auctioning of the international traffic rights,&#13;
sale of the aircraft related assets, and spin-off of the domestic operations).&#13;
Note: The use of a "privatization trust concept" or similar would be explored by the Financial Advisor as a&#13;
mechanism to increase the comfort of the prospective management contractors (i.e., future shareholders in&#13;
CAMAIR II) in the future actions of the GOC with respect to their shares in CAMAIR II.&#13;
C. Legal framework and process of the "proposed concept" 10&#13;
7. A preliminary legal assessment of the "proposed concept" has been done for the preparation of the&#13;
"proposed concept". The major legal procedures could be summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)    Incorporation of CAMAIR II as a separate legal entity under the law  of Cameroon.&#13;
CAMAIR II will be a limited liability company (i.e., societe anonyme) and the majority of&#13;
its capital will be held by Cameroonian shareholders (i.e., 51%). The right to use or the&#13;
ownership of the key airline related assets (i.e traffic rights, aviation related assets, building&#13;
and offices, contracts, name) will be transferred from CAMAIR to CAMAIR II.&#13;
(b)    Transfer of the selected employees to CAMAIR II, either by continuing the current labor&#13;
agreements or by terminating them and initiating new labor agreements (rehiring process).&#13;
A selection procedure similar to the one used for the privatization of ADC (i.e. Aeroports du&#13;
Cameroun) could also be applied.&#13;
(c)    Capitalization of CAMAIR 11 and/or development of the Management Contract, including&#13;
the performance criteria, evaluation criteria, and management incentives.&#13;
(d)    Documentation of the Purchase Option (deferred privatization options) on CAMAIR II&#13;
shares. This could be granted by the agreement between the management contractor and the&#13;
shareholder of CAMAIR II (i.e., the GOC) of a unilateral promise of sale. It could be&#13;
provided in the promise of sale that the number of shares covered by the option and the&#13;
option itself would not be subject to negotiation.&#13;
(e)    Development of the "privatization trust concept" for the shares to be sold at a later date to&#13;
the management contractor and other private investors (i.e., Cameroonian investors).&#13;
10 This preliminary legal assessment applies to both option(a) and (bJ, with the exemption that in option (a) there might not be a need for a&#13;
management contract (i.e.. if equity subscribed by the consortium-strategic investor is equal or above .5O%).&#13;

REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON&#13;
PROJECT FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE TRANSPORT SECTOR REFORM&#13;
Schedule 15: Strategy, Timetable and Key Financial Data for the&#13;
Privatization of Rail Services&#13;
I. STRATEGY&#13;
1.     Le Gouvernement de la Republique du Cameroun a decid6, dans le cadre de la politique de&#13;
restructuration et de privatisation des entreprises publiques du secteur des transports, de conceder&#13;
l'exploitation du chemin de fer camerounais A une societe concessionnaire privee.  Le present&#13;
document presente: (a) les caracteristiques generales retenues pour la concession d'exploitation&#13;
ferroviaire; et (b) les principales modalites de mise en oeuvre de la concession (structuration de la&#13;
societe concessionnaire, procedure de choix de l'actionnaire de reference, calendrier pr6visionnel de la&#13;
mise en concession).&#13;
A. Caracteristiques generales de la concession d'exploitation ferroviaire&#13;
3.     Les conditions de l'exercice de lactivite ferroviaire par le concessionnaire et les relations entre&#13;
l'Etat et le concessionnaire seront definies par une convention de concession signee entre l'Etat et le&#13;
concessionnaire dont les caracteristiques generales sont present6es ci-apres. Au titre de la concession&#13;
le concessionnaire assurera: (a) 1'exploitation technique et commerciale de services de transport&#13;
ferroviaire; (b) ['exploitation, la maintenance, le renouvellement et lamenagement des infrastructures&#13;
ferroviaires existantes; et (c) la gestion domaniale courante du domaine public ferroviaire.  Le&#13;
concessionnaire exercera son activite sur une base commerciale, A ses frais et risques et perils.&#13;
4.     Services de transport ferroviaire. Le concessionnaire exploitera des services de transport&#13;
ferroviaire de marchandises et de voyageurs dits commerciaux, et, eventuellement, A la demande&#13;
explicite de l'Etat, d'autres services de transport ferroviaire de voyageurs dits services exploites A titre&#13;
d'obligation de service public. La nature, la configuration, l'organisation technique et commerciale des&#13;
services dits commerciaux seront librement arretees par le concessionnaire, en reference A ses objectifs&#13;
de rentabilite. Les eventuels services voyageurs exploites A titre d'obligation de service public -&#13;
notamnment les services de desserte locale omnibus - feront l'objet de conventions sign6es entre l'Etat et&#13;
le concessionnaire qui en definiront la configuration et la tarification et qui prevoiront le versement par&#13;
l'Etat au concessionnaire d'une contribution pour obligation de service public permettant de couvrir le&#13;
deficit engendre par lesdits services. Dans une formule variante, qui est brievement decrite au&#13;
paragraphe 13 ci-dessous, 1'exploitation de la totalite des services ferroviaires voyageurs serait assur6e&#13;
par une societe specialisee, distincte du concessionnaire et les seuls services de transport exploites par&#13;
le concessionnaire seraient les services marchandises; le Gouvernement arretera prochainement sa&#13;
decision en ce qui concerne le choix eventuel de cette variante.&#13;
5.     Utilisation  des  infrastructures  ferroviaires  par  d'autres  operateurs  de  transport&#13;
ferroviaire. L'utilisation des infrastructures ferroviaires exploitees par le concessionnaire sera ouverte,&#13;
sur d6cision de l'Etat, a d'autres operateurs de transports ferroviaires apres une periode initiale&#13;
d'exclusivit6 accordee au concessionnaire pour une duree d'environ cinq ans.  L'utilisation des&#13;
infrastructures s'effectuerait dans le cadre de conventions particulieres signees entre le concessionnaire&#13;
et l'op6rateur et l'operateur verserait au concessionnaire un peage d'utilisation des infrastructures.&#13;
64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.     Infrastructures ferroviaires. Les infrastructures ferroviaires existantes, qui sont et resteront&#13;
propriet6 de l'Etat, seront mises A la disposition du concessionnaire. Le concessionnaire organisera&#13;
l'utilisation et assurera l'exploitation et la maintenance des infrastructures ferroviaires et supportera&#13;
directement les charges correspondantes. Le concessionnaire assurera la maitrise d'ouvrage (par&#13;
delegation de l'Etat) et la maitrise d'oeuvre des operations de renouvellement et d'amenagement de&#13;
infrastructures ferroviaires existantes et en assurera le financement (I'Etat pouvant donner sa garantie&#13;
financiere  pour certains  financements). Les operations  de  renouvellement et d'amenagement&#13;
d'infrastructures seront soumises A lagrement de l'Etat; en fin de concession, la partie non amortie des&#13;
investissements sera remboursee au concessionnaire par I'Etat. Les infrastructures nouvelles de&#13;
d6veloppement (creation de lignes nouvelles) seront decid6s par l'Etat qui en fixera les conditions de&#13;
r6alisation; leur eventuelle integration A la concession s'effectuerait par avenant A la convention de&#13;
concession.&#13;
7.     Materiels ferroviaires. En debut de concession, le concessionnaire s6lectionnera parmi les&#13;
materiels existants de la REGIFERCAM les materiels necessaires A son exploitation 1; ces materiels&#13;
seront pris en location par le concessionnaire aupres de l'Etat dans le cadre de contrats de location A&#13;
caractere commercial. Les materiels supplementaires dont le concessionnaire aura besoin en cours de&#13;
concession - soit au titre du renouvellement du mat6riel existant, soit pour faire face au d6veloppement&#13;
du trafic - seront acquis ou loues librement par le concessionnaire, sans intervention ni garantie&#13;
financiere de l'Etat; toutefois, l'Etat beneficiera d'un droit de pr6emption sur les ventes de mat6riels&#13;
par le concessionnaire (afin notamment de garantir, en fin de concession, la p6rennit6 de l'exploitation&#13;
ferroviaire).&#13;
8.     Personnel. Le personnel du concessionnaire sera r6gi par les dispositions du code du travail&#13;
applicables aux salaries du secteur priv6. En debut de concession le concessionnaire s6lectionnera les&#13;
personnels qu'il reprendra parmi les personnels existants de la REGIFERCAM.&#13;
9.     Redevance de concession. Le concessionnaire versera A l'Etat une redevance de concession en&#13;
contrepartie de la mise A disposition des infrastructures ferroviaires existantes et du droit d'exploiter&#13;
les services. Les modalites de d6termination de la redevance (montant forfaitaire annuel, pourcentage&#13;
du chiffre d'affaires du concessionnaire,..) auront A etre arretees.&#13;
10.    Duree de la concession. La concession sera de type "glissant", avec une duree initiale de 20&#13;
ans (duree approximative d'amortissement des materiels ferroviaires) et possibilite de prolongation,&#13;
d'accord parties, pour des p6riodes successives de cinq annees, a decider A l'issue de chaque periode&#13;
quinquennale. La convention de concession fixera par ailleurs les conditions de reprise de&#13;
l'exploitation ferroviaire par l'Etat en cours de concession et de d6cheance du concessionnaire en cas&#13;
de manquement grave.&#13;
11.    Dispositions fiscales. La societe concessionnaire sera soumise aux dispositions fiscales de droit&#13;
commun. Toutefois, les carburants utilis6s dans les locomotives et autres engins sur rail seront acquis&#13;
en franchise des taxes et droits pergus par l'Etat en contrepartie des couts d'utilisation, de maintenance&#13;
et de renouvellement des infrastructures routieres.&#13;
12.    Suivi d'execution de la concession et reglement des litiges. Le suivi d'execution de la&#13;
concession s'effectuera par un Comite de suivi associant representants de l'Etat (Minist&amp;es charg6s des&#13;
. La pertinence des choix du concessionnaire en la matiere sera pr6sent6e dans le projet de Plan dentreprise&#13;
prepare par les candidats (voir paragraphe 16 ci-dessous).&#13;
65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Finances et des Transports) et representants du concessionnaire. Le concessionnaire fournira A titre de&#13;
compte rendu d'activite divers documents A identifier dans la convention de concession. Un auditeur&#13;
independant designe par le comite de suivi effectuera un audit annuel de la concession (examen des&#13;
comptes du concessionnaire, opinion sur le respect par les parties des clauses de la concession). Les&#13;
differends et litiges seront tranches par une commission arbitrale selon les regles de conciliation et&#13;
d'arbitrage de la Chambre de commerce internationale.&#13;
13.    Variante d'organisation de l'activite voyageurs. Ainsi qu'indique au paragraphe 3 ci-dessus,&#13;
le Gouvernement arretera prochainement une decision en matiere d'organisation de l'activite ferroviaire&#13;
voyageurs. En variante de l'organisation dans laquelle les services ferroviaires voyageurs sont&#13;
exploites par le concessionnaire, I'Etat pourrait decider de confier l'exploitation desdits services A une&#13;
societe specialisee, distincte du concessionnaire. Dans cette variante - qui serait notamment justifi6e&#13;
par le fait que lactivite voyageurs rev&amp; pour l'essentiel le caractere de service public (par opposition&#13;
au caractere exclusivement commercial de I'activit6 marchandises) - les services ferroviaires voyageurs&#13;
seraient exploites par une societe distincte dans le cadre d'un contrat d'affermage. Dans ce schema, et&#13;
compte tenu du fait qu'une organisation de la traction des trains voyageurs par un parc de locomotives&#13;
distinct du parc des locomotives affecte A la traction des trains marchandises ne serait actuellement pas&#13;
economique, le r6le du concessionnaire en matiere de services voyageurs consisterait A (i) mettre les&#13;
infrastructures ferroviaires A la disposition de la societe specialisee pour l'exploitation des services&#13;
voyageurs et assurer le dispatching des trains voyageurs; et (ii) assurer la traction des trains voyageurs&#13;
(autres que ceux realisees en rames automotrices). La societe d'exploitation des services voyageurs&#13;
verserait alors au concessionnaire un peage pour l'utilisation des infrastructures (calcule sur la base des&#13;
charges suppl6mentaires supportees par le concessionnaire en raison du trafic voyageurs) et, d'autre&#13;
part, une redevance pour la traction des trains voyageurs (calculee sur la base des kilometres x&#13;
locomotives parcourus).&#13;
B. Modalites de mise en oeuvre de la concession&#13;
Structuration de la societe concessionnaire&#13;
14.    La societe concessionnaire sera une societe anonyme par actions, de droit camerounais, avec&#13;
siege social A Douala. Un actionnaire de reference possedera au minimum 51 % du capital de la societe&#13;
(actions A) et s'engagera A conserver ce pourcentage minimal du capital pendant une duree d'au moins&#13;
sept ans apres le debut de la concession; pour la moiti6 au moins, les actions A devront etre detenues&#13;
par des personnes physiques de nationalite camerounaise ou des societes de droit camerounais; la&#13;
participation de fournisseurs de materiels ferroviaires ou d'entreprises de travaux ferroviaires dans&#13;
l'actionnariat de reference sera interdite. L'actionnaire de reference disposera de la majorit6 des sieges&#13;
au Conseil d'Administration . La partie du capital de la societe concessionnaire autre que celle&#13;
poss6dee par l'actionnaire de reference (actions B) sera destinee A etre souscrite par des personnes&#13;
physiques ou morales de nationalite camerounaise. Au sein de cette partie, cinq % au minimum du&#13;
capital de la societe concessionnaire sera reservee pour le personnel actuel de la REGIFERCAM.&#13;
L'Etat s'engage A ne pas detenir, directement ou par l'intermediaire de societ6s publiques, un&#13;
pourcentage du capital total de la societe excedant 15%. Dans une p6riode interimaire, une partie des&#13;
actions B pourrait, dans l'attente de leur placement aupres de personnes physiques ou morales de&#13;
nationalit6 camerounaise, faire l'objet d'un portage, dans des conditions restant A determiner.&#13;
66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Procedure de choix de I'actionnaire de reference de la societe concessionnaire&#13;
15.    L'actionnaire de reference sera choisi par appel A la concurrence internationale selon une&#13;
procedure en trois etapes, telle qu'esquiss6e ci-dessous. L'ensemble de la procedure sera plac6e sous la&#13;
responsabilit6 de la structure de pilotage.&#13;
16.    Prospection et preselection de candidatures. Les actionnaires de r6ference potentiels feront&#13;
l'objet d'une prospection intense. Un avis d'appel de candidatures sera publie dans la presse nationale&#13;
et dans la presse internationale specialisee; des reunions de presentation seront organisees au Cameroun&#13;
et une mission de prospection se rendra dans divers pays etrangers (Europe occidentale, Am6rique du&#13;
Nord, Afrique du Sud). Les criteres techniques, commerciaux et financiers de qualification seront&#13;
communiques aux candidats qui seront invites A presenter leur dossier de demande de qualification.&#13;
L'ensemble des candidats repondant aux criteres de qualification seront preselectionnes.&#13;
17.    Etape intermediaire de selection. Un dossier de consultation sera transmis A 1'ensemble des&#13;
candidats preselectionnes. Le dossier comportera (i) des elements A caractere informatif sur le contexte&#13;
economique general et l'activite ferroviaire au Cameroun; (ii) les elements de d6finition du cadre&#13;
contractuel et reglementaire de lactivite future de la societe concessionnaire (et en particulier le projet&#13;
de convention de concession); et (iii) la definition du contenu et des modalites de presentation des&#13;
offres. Les offres pr6sent6es A cette etape par les candidats comporteront pour l1essentiel: (a) un plan&#13;
d'entreprise pr6visionnel de la societe concessionnaire pour une periode de cinq ans (perspectives&#13;
d'activite et politique commerciale, programme d'investissements, politique du personnel, projections&#13;
financieres); et (b) leurs commentaires et suggestions sur le projet de convention de concession. Les&#13;
offres seront discutees avec chacun des candidats qui pourront, A l'issue de ces discussions, reviser&#13;
leurs propositions. Les candidats ayant presente un plan d'entreprise juge - le cas echeant apres&#13;
revision - acceptable seront alors invit6s A presenter leur offre pour l'etape final de selection.&#13;
18.    Etape finale de selection. A l'issue de l'tape intermediaire de selection, le Gouvernement&#13;
arretera la redaction definitive de la convention de concession (en tenant compte, le cas echeant, des&#13;
suggestions pr6sentees anterieurement par les candidats) et demandera aux candidats ayant franchi&#13;
l'etape intermediaire de selection de presenter leurs propositions financieres en matiere de redevance de&#13;
concession. Les offres seront ouvertes publiquement et le candidat ayant propose la redevance de&#13;
concession la plus elevee sera definitivement designe comme actionnaire de reference de la societe&#13;
concessionnaire.&#13;
II. TIMETABLE&#13;
19.    La duree totale du processus de mise en concession, est estime A environ 23 mois A partir de sa&#13;
mise en route se decomposant en:&#13;
trois mois pour le recrutement du consultant charge de fournir un appui A la structure&#13;
de pilotage de la mise en concession;&#13;
16 mois pour le processus proprement dit de choix de l'actionnaire de reference de la&#13;
societe concessionnaire; et&#13;
quatre mois pour la preparation de la reprise effective de ['exploitation par le&#13;
concessionnaire.&#13;
67&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Un chronogramme previsionnel des principales etapes est presente et brievement commente&#13;
ci-dessous.&#13;
21.    Choix de lactionnaire de reference de la societt concessionnaire. Le processus de choix de&#13;
l'actionnaire de r6ference de la soci6te concessionnaire proprement dit prendrait environ 16 mois, soit&#13;
sept mois et demi pour la phase de prospection et preselection des candidatures;&#13;
sept mois et demi pour l'etape intermediaire de selection; et&#13;
un mois pour 1'etape finale de selection.&#13;
22.    Preparation de la reprise de Ilexploitation par le concessionnaire. Cette periode, d'environ&#13;
quatre mois, correspond a la creation effective de la societ6 concessionnaire, a la selection du&#13;
personnel a reprendre par le concessionnaire, a la mobilisation par la societe des financements initiaux&#13;
necessaires au d6marrage de 1'exploitation et a la preparation technique de la reprise d'exploitation.&#13;

III. KEY FINANCIAL DATA&#13;
Two options for the privatization of rail services are presented in the operating accounts and the&#13;
Financing plans here-below:&#13;
- Option (a): freight and passenger transport are run separately by two different operators, by the&#13;
freight operator contracted-out to operate passenger transport through a separate entity.&#13;
- Option (b): one single private operator owns and maintains equipment for both freight and passenger&#13;
transport. This would generate economies of scale, but would introduce the risk of penalizing the&#13;
freight sector because of debt dues by the Government for unpaid subsidies to the passenger sector.&#13;
The financing plan of the private operator assumes low financial charges, based on loans with a 2% interest&#13;
rate. Higher financial charges would deter any private investor. Passenger transport would require grants for&#13;
new investments, if any. Consequently, no financial costs and depreciation were considered in the passenger&#13;
transport operating accounts.&#13;
Pnrvatizing railways being a new experience in Africa, the potential private investors will analyze the risks of&#13;
such an operation. In order to attract enough investors to stimulate competition, and thus, to obtain the best&#13;
conditions for the concession of rail services operation to private investors, public owner needs to mitigate the&#13;
risks of the concession. These risks are both commercial (declining market, resulting in lower revenues than&#13;
expected) and political (inflation, devaluation of the currency, political instability).  An analysis of the&#13;
commercial risks of the concession is carried out here-below, to measure the potential impact of these risks for&#13;
the concessionary company, as well as for the State. It demonstrates the need for a careful design of the&#13;
concession agreement to mitigate these risks, and thus enhance the chances for the success of the privatization.&#13;
(1) OPERATING ACCOUNTS AND FINANCING PLAN OF THE CONCESSIONNAIRE.&#13;

(2) RISK ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE OPERATING FEE.&#13;
The financing plan of the pnrvate operator was established using the most probable value scenario for costs and&#13;
benefits. The main factor of risk for the private operator is related to the level of traffic that is expected, which&#13;
directly affects the Rate of Return on his investment. The feasibility study evaluated the average traffic for the&#13;
next ten years at 710 MTK, with a possible variation of +/- 160 MTK (23% of the average traffic).&#13;
Consequently, the risk for the private operator is substantial, and needs to be shared with the public authority.&#13;
This is to be achieved by the careful determination of an appropriate operating fee, paid by the private investor&#13;
to the Government for operating the railway freight services.&#13;
In order to determine the most incentive fee for both the private investor and the Government, a risk analysis&#13;
using Monte-Carlo techniques is presented below, using simple hypothesis (operating costs slightly correlated&#13;
to the level of traffic as most of them are fixed ; levels of traffic for each year correlated one to another ; the&#13;
working capital requirements are correlated to the level of traffic...). The level of traffic, and consequently the&#13;
Operating Surplus, (Excedent Brut d 'Exploitation in the Financing plan above), follows a normal probability&#13;
distribution, between 550 MTK and 870 MTK. The impact of the risk has been measured on:&#13;
- the Rate of Return of the private operator and&#13;
- the level of the operating fee.&#13;
Three scenarios have been considered:&#13;
72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1. The fee is fixed by the contract at a certain level (see Financing plan).&#13;
2. The fee is adjusted each year, as a function of traffic, to guarantee a Rate of Retum of 20% after&#13;
1 0 years for the private contractor.&#13;
3. The fee is related to the level of traffic, so that any variation on the traffic level will be passed half&#13;
on the Fee and, consequently, half on the surplus of the private operator.&#13;
First Scenario: The fee is fixed.&#13;
The simulation showed that the Rate of Return could vary from 6% to 34%, with a 30%&#13;
probability of being under 15%. As a result, the risk for the private operator is too important and is likely to&#13;
deter any investor from getting involved in the concession. The probability of having a rate of return greater&#13;
than 15% needs to be at least 90% (especially in Africa), to attract the private sector.&#13;
Second Scenario: The Fee is adjusted to a Rate of Return of 20%.&#13;
The level of Fee varies between CFA 900 million and CFA 3,360 million. The risk is transferred to the&#13;
Government, who could perceive a very low fee. More, this option doesn't reward the private operator for&#13;
achieving a performant management and commercial policy, as he would get the same rate of return&#13;
independently from its return. With no incentive, the former public monopoly would then become a private&#13;
monopoly.&#13;

Certainty Range is from 1590 to 2750&#13;
This scenario is a compromise between the previous ones, as each variation on the traffic is equally shared&#13;
by the operating fee and by the Operating surplus (i.e the Rate of Return). This will:&#13;
- mitigate the risks for both the private operator and the Government (see diagrams),&#13;
- thus, lower the risk reward expected by the private operator for making the initial investrnent,&#13;
- keep the incentive for him to serious management and dynamic comnnercial policy.&#13;
This method can help both parties determining the appropriate operating Fee, in accordance with their&#13;
expectations in terms of risks.&#13;

TRANSPORT SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
Schedule 22: Guidelines for Preparing Training Activities&#13;
1.    Participation of Local Counterparts in Studies.  Training activities should aim at&#13;
making trained staff capable of using in their position the experience gained through participation&#13;
in studies. This objective will be included in the terms of reference of consultants. Training will&#13;
be carried out either through the execution of specific tasks by the local counterparts according to&#13;
terms of reference, or through more formal training carried out by the consultants to explain the&#13;
methodology and tasks carried out under the study. A report will be prepared by the counterparts&#13;
for tasks executed by them. Consultants' proposals should include the time necessary to train&#13;
counterparts during execution of studies, and the corresponding budget. Training efficiency will&#13;
be assessed during the discussions and seminars held during project execution, where counterparts&#13;
will have to present conclusions and recommendations of studies. Counterparts will also have to&#13;
prepare summaries of studies.  The project coordinator will monitor resources allocated to&#13;
training.&#13;
2.     Preparation of Training Activities. During project execution, training activities should&#13;
aim at increased staff productivity and ability to deliver services. Training will be defined after&#13;
identifying tasks and responsibilities that ministry staff or group of staff are not able to execute or&#13;
fulfill because of lack of competencies. The training program should be designed to respond to:&#13;
(a)    Individual staff needs. Such training activities should be limited because of their&#13;
cost and the difficulty of clearly identifying training requirements and priorities.&#13;
(b)    Group needs.  This maximizes the productivity of resources invested in the&#13;
program, and should be the priority.&#13;
3.    Training sites should be first in the country of the Borrower, either on the work site, or in&#13;
local training centers. When training requirements cannot be achieved in the country, training&#13;
should be considered in a regional training center, and, as a last resort, in another continent. In the&#13;
latter case, it should be clearly demonstrated that the training is in accordance with project&#13;
objectives, and does not interfere with work execution and responsibilities of trained staff during&#13;
project execution.&#13;
4.     Training plans will be prepared for one year, and submitted to the Bank as well as their&#13;
cost, for no-objection at least one month before they start. Per diem will be paid on the basis of&#13;
UNDP tariffs. The Government will bear the balance in excess with actual expenditures.&#13;
