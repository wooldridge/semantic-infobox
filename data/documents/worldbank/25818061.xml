I&#13;
Interpretative Addendum&#13;
For purposes of interpreting Art. 14.1.4 of the 2014 Framework Agreement (and not as a&#13;
derogation from such Article), - the "notional approach" referred to therein shall apply in the&#13;
following manner in cases of both Direct and Indirect Management modalities:&#13;
a) This Trust Fund is a "Multi Donor Trust Fund" or "MDTF," defined as follows in&#13;
Article 1 (v) of the 2014 Framework Agreement: "a trust fund that may receive&#13;
contributions from more than one donor, whose funds are pooled under a single set of&#13;
agreed terms and such funds are not earmarked by individual donors for specific&#13;
categories of expenditures, also known as 'joint co-financing' by the Commission."&#13;
Consequently, the contributions from the Commission, as well as from other donors&#13;
("Other Contributions"), form an account of commingled funds (the "MDTF Pool")&#13;
within which no one particular donor's contribution can be traced.&#13;
b) In administering the MDTF Pool, the Bank applies terms that are the same for all&#13;
contributions to the MDTF, in addition to terms, derived from the 2014 Framework&#13;
Agreement, that apply solely to the Commission Contribution ("Commission Terms").&#13;
Examples of Commission Terms include (i) that costs are incurred within a specified&#13;
time period (2014 Framework Agreement Arts. 14.1.1(c) and 14.2.1(b)), (ii) that costs&#13;
are verifiable through supporting documents retained for 7-years after the applicable End&#13;
Disbursement Date (2014 Framework Agreement Arts. 14.1.1(e), 14.2.1(d) and 17.4), or&#13;
(iii) that the Trust Fund pay for indirect costs only at levels not exceeding those accepted&#13;
by the Commission pursuant to 2014 Framework Agreement Art. 13.4.&#13;
c) The notional approach allows the Commission to participate in MDTFs where not all&#13;
expenditures would be eligible for the Commission (see point b immediately above)&#13;
without earmarking its contribution to specific items or on the basis of geographical&#13;
criteria. It allows so by verifying that there is enough expenditure in the MDTF eligible&#13;
in accordance with the Commission Terms to justify the Commission contribution.&#13;
d) Consequently, if, in carrying out verifications or audits of the Trust Fund under 2014&#13;
Framework Agreement Art. 17.2, a sampling by a European Union competent body&#13;
finds ineligible expenditures because of non-compliance solely with Commission Terms,   I&#13;
no refunds need be made by the Bank or any Recipients, nor shall adjustments be made&#13;
under 2014 Framework Agreement Art. 15.3.1, nor shall any offsets be applied under&#13;
2014 Framework Agreement Art. 16.5 or otherwise, as long as sufficient Other&#13;
Contributions to cover the amount of such expenditures were made to the MDTF Pool&#13;
before the End Disbursement Date. Such refunds, adjustments or offsets may only be&#13;
applied (i) if, and to the extent, the ineligible expenditures are in excess of Other&#13;
Contributions and (ii) if the Bank does not provide documentation to justify that an&#13;
amount equal to such ineligible expenditures is covered by the Other Contributions.&#13;
The provisions of this paragraph shall be applied in conjunction and are consistent with Art. 17&#13;
of, and Attachment 3 to, the 2014 Framework Agreement, and are also consistent with the terms&#13;
of Art. 42.2 of the Rules of Application (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012&#13;
of 29 October 2012).&#13;

Governance&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements&#13;
between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
The SSATP governance framework as defined in its Statutes comprises:&#13;
1. The General Assembly (GA), a consultative body that endorses SSATP DP3 mandate,&#13;
development plans and the annual reports.&#13;
2. The Executive Committee (referred to as the #Committee#), which is responsible for&#13;
overseeing the implementation of the program. It comprises representatives from the&#13;
institutional administrator of SSATP (the World Bank), multi and bilateral, financing&#13;
partners, African countries, African Institutions, Regional Economic Commissions&#13;
(RECs), and the private sector.&#13;
3. An Independent Panel of Experts (IPEs) will advise the Committee on achieving&#13;
program objectives.&#13;
4. The Secretariat of the Committee is the Program Management Team (PMT) that&#13;
provides both advisory and day-to-day management support to the Committee; and also&#13;
responsible for Third Development Plan (DP3) results management.&#13;
5. Working Groups (WG) from member countries will support the PMT and will be&#13;
responsible for developing country-specific work program and will be involved at all&#13;
stages of product development.&#13;
6. A mid-term review will be conducted by external independent evaluation consultants&#13;
hired by the Bank to review and provide recommendation on the implementation of the&#13;
Project to the Bank and Donors following a consultative process.&#13;
