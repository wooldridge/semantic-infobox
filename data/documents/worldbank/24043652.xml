Governance Structure, Description of Activities and Expenditures under the Multi-Donor&#13;
Trust Fund for Forced Displacement (TFO71295)&#13;
1      Purpose&#13;
The overall aim of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) is to identify and address opportunities&#13;
for improving the Bank's contribution to an enhanced development response to forced&#13;
displacement that supports economically and socially sustainable solutions. In consultation with&#13;
Bank regional/country management units and international partners, the MDTF will facilitate and&#13;
support the research, preparation and implementation of operations, promote learning and&#13;
partnership development with international and local actors to better address forced displacement&#13;
as a development challenge. The MDTF will encourage concerned developmental actors&#13;
including the Bank to be engaged from the outset of the crisis that induces displacement to ensure&#13;
that the development dimensions of recovery are addressed and an effective transition from crisis&#13;
thorough recovery to sustainable development.&#13;
2.     Description of Activities&#13;
The MDTF would support the following types of activities:&#13;
(a)    Applied Research. Activities would include: (i) collection and analysis of socio-&#13;
economic baseline data; (ii) socio-economic impact analysis; (iii) sector specific and thematic&#13;
analytical work; (iv) development of tools for the use of Bank staff and other international actors&#13;
in addressing displacement; and (v) other activities in support of the applied research, as approved&#13;
by the Bank.&#13;
(b)    Partnerships. Partnerships with international actors (such as UN agencies, NGOs and&#13;
bilaterals), would promote better coordination of activities at the field level and ensure that the&#13;
development dimensions of displacement are addressed in a comprehensive manner through: (i)&#13;
the provision of socio-economic and sector data to partners and governments; (ii) participation in&#13;
joint needs assessments; analysis and planning of operations; (iii) improvement of Bank field&#13;
presence working with partners; (iv) dissemination of studies and information, including the&#13;
outcome of applied research, among all partners; and (v) other activities in support of&#13;
partnerships, as approved by the Bank.&#13;
(c)    Operations. Support for developing an operational agenda by: (i) integrating displacement&#13;
issues in CASs, ISNs, PRSPs; (ii) reviewing of country portfolios; and (iii) designing and&#13;
implementing new operations and grants.&#13;
(d)    Monitoring and Evaluation of activities include the assessment of: (i) the MDTF program&#13;
in terms of the quality and relevance of the analytical work; (ii) the partnership engagement; and&#13;
(iii) the Bank's operational response to address the displacement development challenge.&#13;
3.     Governance Structure&#13;
The MDTF will be housed within the Social Development Department (SDV) in the Sustainable&#13;
Development Network Vice Presidency.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿The day to day management of the MDTF will be undertaken by the displacement team, which is&#13;
as part of the Conflict, Crime and Violence group within the SDV, under the supervision of a&#13;
MDTF coordinator. The displacement team will administer, manage and oversee the MDTF&#13;
activities, provide support to the SDV management, prepare annual monitoring reports and&#13;
organize annual discussions with donors to the MDTF. The SDV Director will appoint a MDTF&#13;
coordinator who will manage the Trust Fund and the displacement team. The SDV management&#13;
will be responsible for developing the MDTF's annual work plan, overseeing the distribution of&#13;
funds, and monitoring the MDTF outcomes and impact.&#13;
Through an annual consultation process, the MDTF donors will be able to provide the SDV&#13;
management input into and feedback on the proposed annual work plan and budget. An annual&#13;
progress report, evaluating the outcomes of the activities financed, will be submitted to the MDTF&#13;
donors. As part of the work, regular informal consultations will be carried out with key UN&#13;
agencies, interested bilaterals and NGOs to discuss activities and review progress.&#13;
Following the establishment of the MDTF the displacement team will further develop the&#13;
resource allocation process which is foreseen to be based on the demand for activities from&#13;
ongoing consultations with regions and country units. Funds will be allocated for activities that&#13;
take advantage of opportunities for improving partnerships, analytical and operational,&#13;
approaches, as well as policies for sustainable solutions for displaced people.&#13;
4.     Categories of Eligible Expenditures&#13;
The Contribution funds may be used to finance the following categories of expenditures for the&#13;
Recipient-executed activities: training and workshops, consultants' services, goods, works and&#13;
non-consultants' services, operating costs and grants. The Contribution funds may be used to&#13;
finance the following categories of expenditures for Bank-executed activities: consultant fees,&#13;
staff costs, Extended Term consultants, temporary support staff costs, media and workshop costs,&#13;
travel expenses, associated overheads, and contractual services.&#13;

1.     Background.&#13;
1.1.  The operational policies of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
("IBRD") and International Development Association ("IDA") (IBRD and IDA collectively&#13;
referred to as "World Bank"), provide that in the event of certain crises and emergencies in a&#13;
member country of the World Bank ("Member Country"), the World Bank may, at the request of&#13;
the Member Country, agree to special implementation arrangements for early recovery activities&#13;
financed by the World Bank out of the proceeds of trust funds administered by the World Bank,&#13;
including grants to UN agencies active in the Member Country for such activities, along with&#13;
capacity-building measures to enable a timely transfer of the implementation responsibilities to&#13;
the Member Country.'&#13;
1.2.  In order to facilitate the making of such grants, the World Bank and several United&#13;
Nations organizations (each a "UN-FPA Signatory"), have entered into a Fiduciary Principles&#13;
Accord ("FPA") set forth in the Attachment to these standard provisions ("FPA Standard&#13;
Provisions"), pursuant to which the Bank and the UN-FPA Signatories have agreed to special&#13;
arrangements for the disbursement of such grants and implementation of activities financed&#13;
thereunder.&#13;
2.     General Terms and Conditions of FPA Grants.&#13;
2.1.   These FPA Standard Conditions set forth certain terms and conditions generally&#13;
applicable to those trust funds administered by IBRD or IDA that provide for the financing, out of&#13;
the proceeds of such trust funds, of grants to UN-FPA Signatories in accordance with the FPA&#13;
("FPA Grants"). They apply to the extent specified in the agreement or agreements (each, an&#13;
"Administration Agreement") between the World Bank and donors ("Donors") for the&#13;
establishment of each such trust fund ("Trust Fund").&#13;
See, Operational Policy 8.00, Rapid Response To Crises And Emergencies,&#13;

defined in paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2) is signed by the World Bank;&#13;
(b)    on the terms and conditions set forth in a disbursement agreement entered into&#13;

("FPA Disbursement Agreement") set forth in Annex 2 to the Attachment to these FPA Standard&#13;
Provisions;&#13;
(c)    for the purposes of activities described in the FPA Disbursement Agreement&#13;
(variously, "Activities" or "Project") and on the basis of a budget ("Activities Budget"), both of&#13;
which will have previously been considered and approved for financing under an FPA Grant by&#13;
the governance mechanism established under the Administration Agreement which has authority to&#13;
determine the allocation of funds in connection with the Trust Fund ("Trust Fund Steering Committee")&#13;
in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 below; and&#13;
(d)    only after the World Bank has determined, on the basis of a request from the&#13;
Member Country, that implementation of these Activities by the UN-FPA Signatory, is&#13;
appropriate under the World Bank's Operational Policy 8.00 Rapid Response To Crises And&#13;
Emergencies;&#13;
2.3.   The Donors understand and agree that each of the Activities for which an FPA Grant is&#13;

rules, policies, procedures and administrative practices of the UN-FPA Signatory, including those&#13;
relating to its financial management, procurement, anti-corruption, environmental, social and&#13;
resettlement policies, as well as those relating to direct and indirect costs (including indirect&#13;
program support costs) and interest (collectively, "UN-FPA Signatory Policies"), all in a manner&#13;
consistent with the FPA and as specified in the FPA Disbursement Agreement.&#13;
2.4.   The World Bank shall, in the discharge of its duties to the Donors hereunder with respect&#13;
to each FPA Grant to a UN-FPA Signatory, be entitled to rely on any assurances or undertakings&#13;
made by the UN-FPA Signatory, including the undertaking to notify the World Bank if it&#13;
concludes that it is no longer able to give any of the assurances or undertakings provided by.it&#13;
under the FPA or under any other agreements between it and the Member Country and or the&#13;
World Bank relating to the Activities.&#13;
2.5.   The World Bank will have no responsibility towards the Donors with respect to the&#13;
Activities or any FPA Grant except as expressly provided in these FPA Standard Provisions.&#13;
3.     Procedures for Making FPA Grants&#13;
3.1.   The World Bank will ensure that, except as otherwise agreed by the Trust Fund Steering&#13;
Committee, no Activities will be eligible for financing under an FPA Grant unless and until:&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
COMPONENT 1: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES&#13;
The organisation maintains sound financial management systems and arrangements to&#13;
ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended with due attention to considerations of&#13;
economy and efficiency and value for money. The organisation's financial management systems&#13;
and arrangements (which include its budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds flow,&#13;
financial reporting and internal and external auditing arrangements, and related policies,&#13;
procedures and practices): facilitate the preparation of regular, timely and reliable financial&#13;
statements; support the provision of a complete, true and fair record of all transactions and&#13;
balances, including those relating to funds to which this FPA applies; safeguard assets, including&#13;
assets financed by funds to which this FPA applies; and are subject to internal and external&#13;
auditing arrangements in line with internationally accepted standards.&#13;
The organisation's auditing arrangements allow, on an exceptional basis, for its external&#13;
auditors to be requested to perform a special examination.&#13;
The organisation continuously undertakes appropriate measures, including capacity&#13;
strengthening, to mitigate risks posed by any weakness identified in its financial management&#13;
systems and arrangements.&#13;
COMPONENT 2: PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES&#13;
The organisation's procurement policies and procedures: require procurement actions to&#13;
be taken on the basis of economy and efficiency, and value for money (with due consideration&#13;
towards promotion of sustainable and competitive markets); require transparency to the maximum&#13;
extent possible consistent with achieving all other goals of a sound procurement system; and have&#13;
appropriate procedures for all different types of procurement (goods, works, consulting and non-&#13;
consulting services etc.).&#13;
These procurement policies and procedures provide for a range of procurement modalities&#13;
including but not limited to open competitive bidding, invitation to bid issued to pre-qualified&#13;
suppliers selected by the organisation, and single sourcing. In the case of open competitive&#13;
bidding, the organisation's procurement policies and procedures provide for timely and effective&#13;
notification of bidding opportunities, use of bidding documents that clearly identify all&#13;
requirements and evaluation criteria, and award based on those criteria as set forth in the bidding&#13;
documents. The organisation may also have provisions for acceptance of unsolicited approaches&#13;
from potential suppliers to be pre-qualified.&#13;
The organisation's contract documents clearly define the contracting parties' rights and&#13;
obligations.&#13;
The organisation's procurement policies and procedures also provide for publication of&#13;
award of contract in appropriate cases.&#13;
The organisation's procurement policies and procedures ensure clear identification of&#13;
authority to take procurement actions and accountability for such actions. The organisation's&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿procurement policies and procedures and other applicable regulations, rules, and procedures,&#13;
provide appropriate processes and structures for monitoring and evaluation of procurement&#13;
actions and performance, and enable reporting of problems and complaints to officials with&#13;
authority to address such problems based on appropriate mechanisms and in a timely manner and,&#13;
where appropriate, provide for remedies.&#13;
The organisation's procurement policies and procedures do not prevent it from&#13;
determining, through disclosure by potential contractors or vendors, whether a party to which it is&#13;
considering issuing a contract is subject to any sanction or temporary suspension imposed by any&#13;
organisation within the United Nations System including the World Bank.&#13;
COMPONENT 3:        PROGRAMME OR PROJECT DESIGN OR PREPARATION, IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
AND MONITORING&#13;
Programme or Project Preparation and Implementation&#13;
The organisation's programmes or projects are based on the organisation's mandate; are&#13;
based on policies and procedures for programme and project design or preparation and&#13;
implementation that are transparent and publicly available; are developed through a process that&#13;
includes as appropriate participation by and consultation with relevant stakeholders including&#13;
member government counterparts and others; are designed to avoid, mitigate, or minimize adverse&#13;
environmental and social impacts; are based on a results-based approach or a similar conceptual&#13;
approach; are focused on results; have objectives, indicators of achievement and assumptions that&#13;
are clearly stated; have performance measures based on objectives that are specific, measurable,&#13;
attainable, realistic and time-bound; include a monitoring and evaluation plan; and are subject to&#13;
review and approval prior to implementation.&#13;
Reporting Arrangements&#13;
The organisation's programme or project reporting requirements include a narrative&#13;
progress report as well as a financial progress report, including financial statements, covering the.&#13;
whole programme or project. The narrative progress report is required to include: a summary of&#13;
the programme or project and the context within which the programme or project is implemented;&#13;
the activities actually carried out during the reporting period; any challenges encountered and&#13;
measures taken to overcome challenges; changes introduced in implementation, including changes&#13;
in the budget; achievements and results of the programme or project with reference to identified&#13;
indicators; and the work plan for the following period. The organisation requires such reports as&#13;
frequently as is necessary to ensure the reports are useful management tools and to provide&#13;
meaningful reports and assessments of progress, achievements, and challenges.&#13;
Monitorin, and Evaluation Arrangements&#13;
The organisation's programme and project monitoring arrangements are designed to&#13;
ensure frequent monitoring of the implementation of its programmes or projects to test for on-&#13;
going progress and the achievement of outcomes as planned. The organisation's evaluation&#13;
function (or its equivalent), while appointed by management, operates without interference or&#13;
instruction by management and has access as it deems necessary to the member countries or&#13;
shareholders. The organisation's evaluation function uses the appropriate evaluation methodology&#13;
for the programme or project being evaluated, and options may include desk evaluations, in-depth&#13;
evaluations, and evaluations conducted mid-term, terminal or ex-post.&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿COMPONENT 4: ADDRESSING FRAUD AND CORRUPTION&#13;
The organisation's officials are: subject to staff regulations, rules, procedures and&#13;
administrative instructions that prohibit unethical conduct, fraud, and corruption; required, above&#13;
an appropriate level of seniority and responsibility, to provide disclosure of financial interests so&#13;
as to mitigate significantly the risk to the financial assets under the organisation's control;&#13;
expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the organisation's code of conduct.&#13;
The organisation's regulations, rules, procedures and administrative practices provide for&#13;
reasonable measures, consistent with its rules, procedures and administrative practices, to prevent&#13;
and address any information that indicates the need for further scrutiny (including corrupt,&#13;
fraudulent, coercive or collusive practices) in connection with its activities and operations.&#13;
The organisation has established mechanisms for significantly mitigating the risk of fraud&#13;
and corruption in its activities and operations including a "hotline" to receive allegations of fraud&#13;
or corruption; protection for whistleblowers against retaliation; and an internal investigations&#13;
function that, while appointed by and reporting to management, operates without interference or&#13;
instruction by management.&#13;
The organisation has appropriate mechanisms in place to exclude firms or individuals&#13;
determined by it to have engaged in fraudulent or corrupt activities from participation in contracts&#13;
with such organisation, whether indefinitely or for a specified duration; and is not prevented from&#13;
giving due regard to similar decisions by other international organisations, including&#13;
organisations that are signatories to this FPA.&#13;

Re:   [grant name and number]&#13;
Dear [ ]:&#13;
I am writing on behalf of the [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] [and]&#13;
[International Development Association] (the "World Bank" or the "Disbursing Organization"), as&#13;
administrator of the [Multi-Donor] Trust Fund for [name of trust fund] (the "Trust Fund") to indicate the&#13;
Disbursing Organization's agreement to make a grant in an amount not exceeding [amount in words]&#13;
United States Dollars (US$ [amount in figures]) (the "Grant") to [name of UN Organization] (the&#13;
"Receiving Organization") for the benefit of [name of country] (the "Beneficiary").&#13;
The Grant is made in accordance with instructions from the [name of governing mechanism] (the&#13;
"Trust Fund Steering Committee"), which has authority to determine the allocation of funds in connection&#13;
with the Trust Fund by virtue of an administration agreement and/or resolution(s) for the establishment of&#13;
the Trust Fund. The Grant is made for the purposes and on the terms and conditions set forth in the&#13;
annexes to this Agreement.&#13;
The Receiving Organization represents, by confirming its agreement below, that it is authorised to&#13;
contract and withdraw the Grant for the said purposes and on the said terms and conditions, and the&#13;
Receiving Organization makes this representation knowing that Disbursing Organization will rely on it for&#13;
purposes of disbursing the Grant.&#13;
In light of the fact that both the Disbursing Organization and the Receiving Organization are&#13;
signatories to the Fiduciary Principles Accord dated as of [ ] (the "EPA"), the funds transferred under this&#13;
Grant will be received, administered, managed, expended, reported on, and audited, exclusively in&#13;
accordance with the regulations, rules, procedures and administrative practices of the Receiving&#13;
Organization, including those relating to its environmental, social and resettlement policies as well as&#13;
those relating to direct and indirect costs (including indirect programme support costs) and interest, and&#13;
will be subject to the terms of this Agreement. In this regard, it is understood that indirect costs of the&#13;
Receiving Organizations recovered through programme support costs will be 7% and that in&#13;
