Global Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is a WSP project focused on learning how to&#13;
combine the approaches of Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), behavior&#13;
change communication, and sanitation marketing to generate sanitation demand&#13;
and strengthen the supply of sanitation products and services at scale, leading&#13;
to improved health for people in rural areas. It is a large-scale effort to meet the&#13;
basic sanitation needs of the rural poor who do not currently have access to safe&#13;
and hygienic sanitation. The project is being implemented by local and national&#13;
governments with technical support from WSP. For more information, please visit&#13;

This Working Paper is one in a series of knowledge products designed to showcase&#13;
project findings, assessments, and lessons learned in the Global Scaling Up Rural&#13;
Sanitation Project. This paper is conceived as a work in progress to encourage&#13;
the exchange of ideas about development issues. For more information please&#13;

  This social map of Dusun Juwet was created following triggering and updated periodically to track behavior change and&#13;
  access to sanitation. At the time this photo was taken, Dusun Juwet was close to becoming open defecation free, with just&#13;
  three households continuing to practice open defecation. These households became open defecation free in March 2010,&#13;
  four months after triggering. Enlargements show sections of the map in greater detail.&#13;

      Using this system, sanitarians attached to puskesmas are required to routinely collect data from the community level and&#13;
      upload the data via SMS, in real time, into a computer-based gateway system located at the district health office. The system&#13;
      automatically verifies newly reported progress against baseline and previous month's data, and generates reports--eliminating&#13;
      the need for manual data entry. Periodic, random checks are made at the community level and during ODF verification exer-&#13;

     Notes&#13;
       1. The 10 questions must be adapted to field situations and `read between the&#13;
          lines' like a question in the checklist.&#13;
       2. Notes from each of the latrines observed and the results of interviews with&#13;
          owners and users are needed like separate formats in section C.&#13;
       3. If the owner/user of the latrine were not at home, try to find out and&#13;
          search for information from the nearest neighbors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                             Process notes&#13;
&#13;
       1 Observe the latrine (find the indication that latrine was used). Interview the owner, how many times a day is it used?&#13;
         Are they defecating in the latrine consistently? Is anyone still going to the paddy field, river or yard?&#13;
       2 If they have babies, ask the parents. What about the baby's diaper, washed where? (If washed in toilet, look for evidence.)&#13;
       3 By observation: Is the slab tilting or cracked? Ask the user how they feel about the safety of that facility.&#13;
       4 Ask about the source of drinking water used by community. If using a dugwell or borehole, ask where is the position of the&#13;
         water source, and which are the nearest latrines.&#13;
       5 Observe: for dry pit latrine if the cover is not fully covering the hole, or there is no water seal in a pour flush latrine, score&#13;
         can be 0.&#13;
       6 Observe: Check if you can see any insects or other animals able to reach the feces in the pit, on the slab or the&#13;
         ventilation pipe.&#13;
       7 If you see feces on the floor/slab/wall, score is 0, and make a note based on user comment about it.&#13;
       8 See indicator (availability of water and soap and trace of soap use). During interview, ask member of household to show&#13;
         how they wash hands. If soap is not found inside the latrine, see if it is brought in and used.&#13;
       9 Find out where they usually eat. Ask where they wash their hands. (See if hand washing facility is conveniently close to eat-&#13;
         ing place. Check actual practice if close to meal time.)&#13;
      10 Do by observing the surrounding of their house (bushes, gutter, field, river, trash bin, or other places).&#13;

            Managing the flow of monitoring information
            to improve rural sanitation in East Java
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Global scaling up rural sanitation is a
            Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) project currently being
            implemented in India, Indonesia, and Tanzania. Working with
            local governments and the private sector in 29 districts of
            East Java province in Indonesia, WSP's approach
            combines generating demand from local governments prior to
            initiating project interventions and demand from consumers
            for improved sanitation facilities and behaviors prior to
            making a greater range of sanitation products and services
            available through local markets. This demand responsive
            approach combines Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS),
            behavior change communication, and sanitation marketing
            approaches to help villages become open defecation free
            (ODF). At the end of the third year of project
            implementation, household access to sanitation is growing at
            rates hitherto never seen in rural sanitation projects in
            Indonesia. On average, one-third of all triggered
            communities have become ODF within a year. However, across
            districts, varying levels of progress have been achieved
            depending on the extent of political support garnered,
            implementation capacity developed, and the
            cost-effectiveness of interventions undertaken. However,
            during 2009 the project team observed that while monitoring
            data was being generated regularly in the communities, much
            of this data was not reaching sub-district, district, or
            higher levels for regular consolidation. With the number of
            triggered communities running into the thousands in East
            Java, it had become too labor and time intensive for
            government outreach staff to collect data manually from each
            triggered community on a monthly basis. In response to this
            challenge, a community-based participatory outcome
            monitoring system was developed.
