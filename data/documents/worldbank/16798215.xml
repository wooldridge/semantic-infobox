Southern Sudan&#13;
Summary&#13;
*  In 2010 and 2011 the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Southern Sudan (MDTF-SS)&#13;
disbursed US$274 million and those resources have effectively supported the&#13;
achievement of many of the results that MDTF-SS funded operations are designed to&#13;
deliver. By the end of February 2012, some $497 million had been disbursed, representing&#13;
92% of the total funds contributed by donors (US$549 million), and by mid-March the figure&#13;
was over $500 million.&#13;
*  Results achieved include construction of the first offices for the new autonomous&#13;
Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS); the introduction of a single currency for Sudan&#13;
replacing six different currencies that were under circulation prior to the CPA; support to the&#13;
police and prisons; development of roads; water supply; schools; and health infrastructure.&#13;
*  Despite this strong record of progress, there are a few operations which it is now clear&#13;
cannot be completed, as currently designed, by the scheduled date for completion of&#13;
activities-June 30, 2012. The activity completion date falls six months before the trust fund&#13;
closing date, to allow the required time for necessary closing and accounting procedures. In&#13;
exceptional circumstances the World Bank, as administrator of MDTF-SS, may be able to&#13;
compress these closing procedures somewhat, so as to allow for a later activity completion&#13;
date where that is essential, however this is not normally recommended.&#13;
*  Recent political, security and economic developments have complicated the efforts to&#13;
bring MDTF-SS to a timely close&#13;
*  For MDTF-SS there are therefore three scenarios available:&#13;
a. To close all MDTF-SS funding of activities as currently scheduled on June 30, 2012.&#13;
b. To seek World Bank management agreement to compress the closing procedures, so as to&#13;
allow funding of activities to continue for a further three months, that is to have an&#13;
activity completion date, where necessary, of September 30, 2012.&#13;
c. To extend the closing date of the trust fund to June 30, 2013, thus allowing the activity&#13;
completion date for some operations, where necessary, to be extended to December 31,&#13;
2012. This is the scenario preferred by GoSS, as per their letter to the Technical&#13;
Secretariat received March 21st, 2012.&#13;
*  Reallocation of funds to existing or new operations is not a realistic option in this time&#13;
frame because (i) currently effectively all resources have been committed through grant&#13;
agreements with GoSS, so reallocation would require the Technical Secretariat first to&#13;
recover the funds through amended grant amendments, before reallocating them; and (ii)&#13;
there is very limited time to complete additional administrative procedures before activity&#13;
completion.&#13;

ï»¿Sub Annex Ha to the Administrative Agreement for the Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTF) for&#13;
Southern Sudan&#13;
1.    Background&#13;
1.    The Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Southern Sudan (MDTF-SS) was set up as part of Sudan's&#13;
2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). It has been administered by the World Bank through a&#13;
Technical Secretariat based in Juba, but also drawing as necessary on resources from other parts of&#13;
the organization. MDTF-SS was designed to provide a financing mechanism to address priority&#13;
findings of the 2004 UN/World Bank/Sudan/SPLM Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) on the recovery&#13;
and development of (then) Southern Sudan. It has provided a means for donors to support the&#13;
implemTientation of the economic and social provisions of the CPA, through the financing of specific&#13;
projects. The MDTF-SS was therefore originally structured to cover the same period as the CPA,&#13;
from 2005 to 2011, with a closing date of December 30, 2011, and a completion date for activities of&#13;
June 30, 2011, to allow for proper accounting and audit of the whole program, and other necessary&#13;
closing formalities.&#13;
2.    By the end of December 2010, it became apparent that there was a large unspent balance from&#13;
the donor contributions that would not be disbursed by June 30, 2011. In anticipation of South Sudan&#13;
seceding from Sudan and to allow bridge funding beyond the end of the interim period established&#13;
under the CPA, all fourteen donors to MDTF-SS agreed to a recommendation from the Technical&#13;
Secrelariat that the life of MDTF-SS be extended for one more year to December 30, 2012, with&#13;
projects closing six months earlier, i.e. by June 30, 2012, to allow for the necessary closing&#13;
procedures.&#13;

3.    The overarching objective of MDTF-SS is to ensure coordinated, flexible and timely shared&#13;
responses by donors and the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) to the JAM during the Interim&#13;
Period specified in the CPA. When the MDTF-SS was established, it therefore had three core&#13;
objectives and aspirations:&#13;

2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Sub Annex Ha to the Administrative Agreement for the Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTF) for&#13;
Southern Sudan&#13;
*  To be a key instrument for quickly supporting the buildup of GoSS across the board capacity in&#13;
the identification, implementation, and monitoring and evaluating of its development activities&#13;
(state building).&#13;
*  To be a major instrument for delivering badly needed basic services for the people of post-conflict&#13;
Southern Sudan (peace building).&#13;
*  To serve as a key forum for facilitating the continuous interaction of the GoSS and its Donor&#13;
partners, on strategic aspects of the Government's development agenda (partnership deepening).&#13;
4.    Moreover, the MDTF-SS was expected to evolve in full alignment with the overall&#13;
development priorities of the GoSS. In general, although these priorities have changed over the life of&#13;
MDTF-SS, becoming more realistic in light of experience and in response to changing national and&#13;
international contexts, it has broadly remained in alignment with the key development national&#13;
priorities of South Sudan.&#13;
5.    The capacity gained in implementing projects, working with donors and NGOs has been&#13;
critical. As Chart 1 above shows, MDTF-SS projects were implemented using various delivery&#13;
mechanisms. While the majority of operations were delivered using government services (61%), and&#13;
this implementation modality has become more common over time, UN agencies (28%) and&#13;
international and national NGOs (11%) also had a prominent role.&#13;
6.    Disbursements from MDTF-SS have been as shown in Table 1 below.&#13;

2.    Results From MDTF-SS&#13;
7.    At the start of MDTF-SS, Southern Sudan had just become an autonomous government under&#13;
the provisions of the CPA-the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS). GoSS faced huge challenges,&#13;
in building its institutional capacity largely from scratch, and recognized the low levels of economic&#13;
and social development in Southern Sudan. Key education and health indicators, such as child and&#13;
maternal mortality and primary enrolment, were among the worst in the world. Road and water&#13;
infrastructure was virtually non-existent, with no paved roads in and outside Juba. Structures for&#13;
service delivery (other than the UN and NGOs) were nonexistent. Despite this difficult operating&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Sub Annex Ha to the Administrative Agreement for the Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTF) for&#13;
Southern Sudan&#13;
envirwi:ment, the MDTF-SS has achieved significant results, working closely with GoSS, who have&#13;
benef 1-ed from increased physical security, considerable independence in managing their development&#13;
agenda, and substantial oil revenues.&#13;
8.    For its first six years, MDTF-SS supported GoSS within the overall political framework of the&#13;
Republic of Sudan. The first three years of the program saw slow progress, owing to low capacity in&#13;
GoSS, unrealistic expectations regarding implementation timeframes, procurement issues and the&#13;
limited presence of sector specialists in the Technical Secretariat to support GoSS with project&#13;
implemnentation. However, over time, enhanced supervision by World Bank management, maturation&#13;
of the projects and increased capacity within GoSS contributed to increased disbursement-projects&#13;
are being approved faster, funds are being disbursed faster, monitoring and evaluation has been&#13;
enhanced, procurement processes were simplified, and engagement with local state and non-state&#13;
actors has increased. In consequence the following results have been achieved:&#13;
*  A core of public administration and basic project management capacity in a number of ministries&#13;
where projects have been implemented has been created; introduction of a new currency; the&#13;
completion of a nationwide population census which was the basis for the 2010 election and the&#13;
subsequent referendum in January 2011; the rehabilitation of police stations and prisons leading to&#13;
improved citizen security.&#13;
*  The health sector program has helred the Ministry develop a monitoring and evaluation strategy,&#13;
including training data collectors aid analysts, and has financed the first-ever mapping of health&#13;
facilities, allowing the Ministry to aave harmonized data collection tools and district health&#13;
information. As a result, medical supplies and facilities have reached more residents each year&#13;
under the funding of the umbrella health and HIV/AIDS projects; more than $30 million worth&#13;
pharmaceutical supplies were distr:.buted to more than 1,200 health facilities in all 10 states;&#13;
essential drugs available in more than 70 percent of supervised health care facilities; 71 health&#13;
facilities were rehabilitated and more than 250,000 malaria kits, 1 million mosquito nets, and 10&#13;
million water purification tablets were distributed. The rehabilitation of 47 buildings at the Juba&#13;
Teaching hospital, the largest such medical facility in South Sudan, means it is now better&#13;
equipped to serve approximately 100,000 patients a year.&#13;
*  In education and capacity building. 46 primary schools and 11 county education centers have been&#13;
built; more than 1,200 new teachers, 300 education managers, 650 alternative education teachers&#13;
and members of local education steering committees have been trained; and more than 3.6 million&#13;
textbooks and teachers' guides have been printed and distributed throughout the 10 states. At the&#13;
professional level, more than 1,200 senior, professional, and sub professional public servants (27&#13;
percent of which were women), have been trained both within the national government and the ten&#13;
state governments.&#13;
*  Building blocks to promote a culture of accountability within the national government structure&#13;
were established with help to produce the first GoSS financial statement and the ongoing audits of&#13;
financial statements, as well as the training of staff and the preparation of an audit manual. An&#13;
audit of government finances for 2005 -2008 has been completed, with 2009 and 2010 to follow.&#13;

* In infrastructure, nearly 3,700 kilometers of all-weather roads have been rehabilitated,&#13;
reconstructed, and maintained. In addition, detailed design and feasibility studies have been&#13;
completed for two major transport routes, together with a survey of the condition of more than&#13;
7,000 kilometers of feeder roads and design of 1,400km of these feeder roads. Over 1,100&#13;
boreholes have been drilled or rehabilitated, and fourteen water distribution systems constructed.&#13;
More than 562,000 people across almost 100,000 households in rural South Sudan now have&#13;
access to clean and safe water. Critical urban infrastructures in major towns, especially in the&#13;
capital city of Juba, now provide access to clean water. Government buildings housing parliament&#13;
and key ministries have been renovated.&#13;
* In the agriculture sector, advisory services and grants for production inputs have been provided to&#13;
more than 116,000 farmers across 27 counties in South Sudan. This has helped to increase yields&#13;
of staple crops especially sorghum and maize by over 30% translating into improved household&#13;
food security and incomes for those beneficiaries that have been able to produce a surplus. Basic&#13;
infrastructure to support agricultural research and their seed sector have been rehabilitated or&#13;
constructed; offices for national and state ministries of agriculture have been built and equipped;&#13;
sector policies have been developed and training centers for forestry practitioners have been&#13;
rehabilitated.&#13;
* In the livestock sector, MDTF-SS support helped restore a mechanism for animal health service&#13;
provision (including vaccination and treatment against disease) through community animal health&#13;
workers, and this has benefited more than 24,000 households. Capacities for animal disease&#13;
surveillance and detection were built through provision of mobile laboratories and communication&#13;
equipment. Shops (with fishing gear and cold facilities) managed through cooperatives&#13;
arrangements were set up to help fisherfolk to manage post-harvest losses and access markets. In&#13;
addition, the livelihood of almost 5,000 women have been improved with the introduction of&#13;
improved agriculture technology, inputs and training through a CBO implemented program in all&#13;
ten states.&#13;
* To link agriculture to market, a Labor Act was launched under the PSD project along with the&#13;
development of 4 micro finance institutions that are disbursing micro credits in the private sector.&#13;
A bolstering initiative for South Sudan's economic diversity and entrepreneurial spirit was started&#13;
through a business plan competition in which 45 winners, 25 of whom were women, each&#13;
received a $20,000 loan to finance their planned ventures. In addition, MDTF-SS resources have&#13;
established an apex microfinance system to support small enterprise to which more than 50,558&#13;
men and women have access.&#13;

10.    Since 2005 GoSS has an impressive record of progress in building capacity from very limited&#13;
beginnings, and continues to make progress to becoming a fully functioning and modem, independent&#13;
state Edministration. Nevertheless, that progress was from a low base and there remains a substantial&#13;
agenda of capacity enhancement ahead. With the possibility of sharply reduced resourcesto support&#13;
GoSS administration, an important part of the current context is to understand both the progress that&#13;
has been made against considerable co:straints while recognizing the progress remaining to be&#13;
achieved towards institutional effectiveness.&#13;
11.    MDTF-SS has provided financing through 25 grant agreements for operations of which 16 are&#13;
complete and nine are currently active, as set out in Table 2 below. That table also shows the&#13;
Technical Secretariat's current underst,nding that if we maintain the current date for completion of&#13;
activilies funded by MDTF-SS, four operations will remain incomplete and for a further four&#13;
operations, this activity completion date will leave some minor elements of the operation incomplete.&#13;

a) The construction of office buildings for the Gender Ministry and the South Sudan Anti-Corruption&#13;
Commission have encountered the baseline challenges of construction in South Sudan, with the&#13;
high cost of raw materials; scarcity of skilled labor; procurement issues and, of particular&#13;
relevance, delays in processing of tax exemption papers for equipment and other materials. During&#13;
early 2012 GoSS has understandably given priority attention to the on-going negotiations between&#13;
themselves and the Government in Sudan, on the unfinished agenda of CPA-related issues,&#13;
unresolved at the time of independence. This focus on negotiations has limited GoSS's ability to&#13;
attend to other important but less pressing priorities, such as project implementation bottlenecks.&#13;
Nevertheless, construction for these offices is now well underway and they can be completed by&#13;
December 31, 2012.&#13;
b) The construction of the office of the Auditor General is more problematic. It has also suffered&#13;
from general construction delays. However, in addition there have been problems in identifying a&#13;
suitable location, and when a site was found construction was then halted due to an internal GoSS&#13;
issue about the site's ownership. GoSS and the Technical Secretariat are currently discussing&#13;
whether there is a viable way forward to allow this activity to be completed in a timely way. The&#13;
Technical Secretariat will provide further advice to the Oversight Committee on this activity once&#13;
the options are clear.&#13;
c) The Water Supply Operation has faced a number of challenges. These include delays in&#13;
construction of boreholes, sanitation works and a laboratory in Bentiu and Malakal because&#13;
contractors expected to get construction materials from Sudan, but the border was closed, due to&#13;
difficulties in Sudan-South Sudan negotiations. In consequence, contractors have had to negotiate&#13;
new prices and sources for materials. The construction of a Haffir in Jonglei has been held up&#13;
because of the recurrent insecurity in that state. This insecurity is now being address by the&#13;
ongoing disarmament initiative led by GoSS, but because of the rainy season, access to the site to&#13;
allow timely completion has become a major challenge for the next few months.&#13;
d)&#13;
Plans for use of unspent DDR funds are pending, and a proposal by UNDP is expected early next&#13;
month (JNDP will brief donors).&#13;

4. Scenarios&#13;
14.   There are three options that could be considered by the Oversight Committee for addressing&#13;
the situation set out above. These are as follows:&#13;
a. Maintain the Current Timetable for Closure. In this case, all activities under MDTF-SS will need&#13;
to be complete by June 30, 2012. Sixteen of the operations financed under MDTF-SS would be&#13;
successfully completed. Four would be completed with minor work remaining incomplete, while&#13;
four operations would face significant challenges to delivering their development objectives.&#13;
These challenges to completion are set out in Annex B.&#13;
b. Compress the Closing Procedures for MDTF-SS. This approach would better ensure the four&#13;
almost complete operations could be tidied up. It would not, however, address the challenges of&#13;
the four incomplete operations.&#13;
c. Extend the closing date ofMDTF-SS. This scenario would protect all the achievements of&#13;
MDTF-SS and would avoid the risk of South Sudan being left with incomplete, donor-funded&#13;
projects. As per their written communication to the OC, this is also the scenario preferred by&#13;
GoSS.&#13;
15.   The administrative implications of these options are:&#13;
a. None.&#13;
b. Internal World Bank action and amendment to some Grant Agreements signed between the&#13;
World Bank and GoSS.&#13;
c. Amended administration agreements with all donors, either to withdraw from MDTF-SS and&#13;
forego their claim for immediate reimbursement of their share , or to agree the extension, and&#13;
amendment to some Grant Agreements signed between the World Bank and GoSS.&#13;
16.   Under any scenario, when MDTF-SS is closed there is likely to be a balance of funds&#13;
remaining, within the parent fund. Under scenario (a) this could be up to US$20 million, while under&#13;
scenario (c) it could likely be around US$2 million. Managing a trust fund to spend to the last penny&#13;
is effectively impossible, when contributions come in a variety of currencies, investment income is&#13;
unpredictable, and disbursements depend on costs that are subject to exchange rate movements. For&#13;
most other trust funds, administered by the World Bank, donors agree that the Bank hold each&#13;
donor's share of the closing balance in a 'Balance Account' from which it can be redeployed to&#13;
another trust fund of similar purpose, or reimbursed to the donor.&#13;

5.    Cost of Any Extension&#13;
17.   If any extension were to be agreed, this would be at no additional cost to MDTF-SS donors,&#13;
since Le Technical Secretariat would not request any new funding. At the beginning of 2011, the&#13;
OC approved the budget for 2011 and 2012. The budget for 2011 was $6.9m and $5m for 2012.&#13;
This budget was anticipated to cover the cost of the Technical Secretariat until the end of December&#13;
2012. The Secretariat calculates that for the projects that might require supervision beyond June&#13;
2012, 1he cost of that supervision is already accounted for. Further, the activities to be extended will&#13;
not require additional expertise to supervise. In addition the cost of the Monitoring Agent will be&#13;
covered from the savings that were made under the current contract. It should also be noted that as&#13;
more projects close, the scope of work for the Monitoring Agent will be substantially reduced.&#13;
6.    MDTF-SS Sustainability after Closure&#13;
18.   The sustainability of MDTF-SS operations after completion depends to an important extent&#13;
on the public expenditure environment in South Sudan at the time of exit, and the extent to which&#13;
GoSS and partners are pursuing implementation of the South Sudan Development Plan (SSDP). As&#13;
already noted, negotiations between South Sudan and Sudan are creating many uncertainties. With&#13;
the suspension of oil production, those uncertainties have increased and the austerity budget s&#13;
currently under implementation is likely to sharply reduce the public expenditure envelope available&#13;
in future. It is therefore unclear how far spending priorities will support and sustain development&#13;
expenditures in future years. The World Bank, IMF and many other development partners have&#13;
offered advice and suggestions to GoS S on how to manage in this uncertain environment, so as to&#13;
protect their development gains since 2005. We continue to remain willing to explore this topic&#13;
further with GoSS as appropriate.&#13;
19.   For its part, the World Bank is following up on some areas of activity that have been funded&#13;
by MDTF-SS. In 2011 Executive Directors of the World Bank approved the creation of a South&#13;
Sudan Transition Trust Fund, financed out of IBRD income, which has provided $75 million to&#13;
support development expenditures in South Sudan. This fund supports three operations, of which&#13;
one for Private Sector Development was recently launched, while the other two for Health and&#13;
Roads are expected to follow shortly. All three operations seek to build on successes within MDTF-&#13;
SS and so provide a measure of sustairability for those sectors, in the current environment.&#13;
20.   South Sudan is currently expected to become a member of the World Bank Group around the&#13;
time of the 2012 World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings. Following membership, South Sudan is&#13;
expected to gain access to IDA 16 resources. As with the transition fund, a key consideration in&#13;
deploying IDA resources will be how to build on, and protect, the development gains since 2005.&#13;
The World Bank is currently preparing an Interim Strategy Note to this end, on which it has had&#13;
some consultations in Juba, including with donor representatives, and expects to consult further in&#13;
future.&#13;
