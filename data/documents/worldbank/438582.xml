ELECTRICITY SECTOR REFORM SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
I.    INDUSTRY DESCRIPTION AND STRUCTURE&#13;
A.   The Electricity Sector&#13;
1.    The electricity sector in Russia is the second largest in the world after the United States&#13;
in terms of generating capacity. Like the rest of the economy, the electricity sector has&#13;
suffered from economic downturn and turmoil during the transition to a market economy. The&#13;
electricity sector accounts for approximately 15 percent of industrial production, more than the&#13;
oil and gas industries combined. Measured GDP has fallen by 40 percent in real terms since&#13;
1991, but the decline in electricity production is only about half as large.&#13;
2.    Until 1992, the electricity sector was organized into vertically integrated companies in&#13;
each of the 72 regions (oblasts). In that year, the Government both converted the regional&#13;
companies (Energos) into joint stock companies and superimposed a nation-wide holding&#13;
company, RAO EES Rossii (RAO), over the Energos. RAO was given ownership of the high&#13;
voltage transmission grid (2.5 million km of high-voltage lines), the largest thermal and&#13;
hydropower plants, the dispatch centers, and research and design institutes. RAO was also&#13;
given a controlling shareholding in most of the regional Energos. RAO organized its power&#13;
stations into generation company subsidiaries (Gencos). Because of opposition from regional&#13;
authorities, some of these larger power stations were kept under regional control and remained&#13;
with the Energos. The nuclear plants remained in the ownership of the Government, and were&#13;
placed undLer the management of Rosenergoatom (see Table 1).&#13;
3.    Geineration is predominantly thermal (70 percent), with hydro (20 percent) and nuclear&#13;
(10 percent) stations comprising the balance. Regionally, however, over 50 percent of the&#13;
hydro capacity is located in Siberia and the Far East, while over 80 percent of the nuclear&#13;
capacity is located in the Northwest and Center regions. Generation in 1995 totaled 843 TWh.&#13;
4.    The Energos are integrated regional monopolies that distribute electricity to the final&#13;
consumers and own the smaller generating plants typically producing both electricity and heat,&#13;
on a monopoly basis, for local district heating systems. Though the size of plants owned by&#13;
the Energos is usually small, the number is large. Thus Energos manage 62 percent of the&#13;
generation capacity.&#13;
5.    With the exception of the entities owning the nuclear plants, the rest of the sector was&#13;
partially privatized (through vouchers and sales to workers and managers) but in such a way&#13;
that the Government retained a controlling interest in most of the companies either directly or&#13;
indirectly through RAO (Figure 1). The resulting ownership structure is complicated. In&#13;
brief, the Government is a 100 percent owner of the nuclear power plants and is majority&#13;
owner (currently holding approximately 52 percent) of RAO. RAO, in turn, is a 100 percent&#13;
&#13;

2Includes plant owned by Minatom&#13;
owner of the transmission grid and dispatch system, 49 percent or larger owner of the Gencos,&#13;
and 49 percent or larger owner of most of the 72 regional Energos. Two of the Energos are&#13;
not owned by RAO or the Federal Government.&#13;
6.    Sector Regulation. At the Federal level, the electricity sector is regulated by the&#13;
Federal Energy Commission (FEC), an independent agency established in 1995, whose seven&#13;
members are appointed by the President for four years. The FEC is mandated to organize the&#13;
wholesale market for electricity, regulate tariffs for the sale of electricity on the wholesale&#13;
market, and define procedures for tariff setting at the end-user level. In 1996, the Commis-&#13;
sion was given a budget and has hired about 100 staff. The Commission also regulates the&#13;
natural gas transmission and oil pipeline industry. Each of the 72 oblasts also has a regional&#13;
energy commission (REC). Many of these are not yet fully functioning. The development of&#13;
the regulatory bodies as functioning agencies has been slow; however, activities have&#13;
accelerated in recent months, with the appointment of additional staff and the provision of&#13;
training to an initial cohort of key personnel.&#13;
7.    Sector Problems. The power sector faces many serious problems including:&#13;
(a) Non-payment and non-cash payment. Estimates for 1996 indicate that consumers paid only&#13;
about 70 percent of their electricity bills (Figure 2). Of this payment, 84 per cent is by means&#13;
other than cash. These non-cash payments include barter transactions, bilateral settlements of&#13;
debts, and various kinds of promissory notes. The causes of this problem are complex, and&#13;
have variously been attributed to: (i) failure on the part of Government to fully fund the&#13;
purchases of budget organizations (which account for 40 percent of the arrears); (ii) periodic&#13;

legal and/or political prohibitions against allowing electricity sector companies to refuse&#13;
service to customers that don't pay; and, (iii) compensating advantages of non-cash payments&#13;
with respect to the potential for tax avoidance, for understating income, and for extracting&#13;
high transaction charges.&#13;
(b) Uneconomic Dispatch. A major source of inefficiency in the sector is caused by the&#13;
operation of generation plants with high variable costs instead of those with low variable costs&#13;
in order to meet current demand. This has been estimated by the Russian Institute of Energy&#13;
Researc]h to increase costs by as much as US$1 billion per year. This is caused by poor&#13;
communications and control systems at the&#13;
dispatch centers, the unwillingness of some     Figure 2: Form of Payment&#13;
Energos to participate in a nationwide system of&#13;
economric dispatch, dispatching high cost plants&#13;
to ensure that they receive a minimum level of                                    Unpaid&#13;
revenue, and shortages of fuel at lower cost                                       30%&#13;
plants.&#13;
(c) Operating Inefficiency. The operating cost&#13;
of compianies in the sector is high. Wages are    Non-Cash&#13;
among the highest in the country. Over the last   Paymen&#13;
five years, employment has increased 40                                            Cash&#13;
percent even though production has decreased                                     Payrsnt&#13;
by about 20 percent. Fuel efficiency in                                            11%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

generation is low both because of inadequate investment in maintenance and refurbishment.&#13;
Few activities are contracted out to competitive private companies.&#13;
(d) Investment Inefficiency. The level of investment is inadequate to meet the system's needs,&#13;
and the available investment funds are spent inefficiently. The sector spent over US$3 billion&#13;
on new facilities in the last two years and yet brought on line only 2,700 MW of new or&#13;
refurbished capacity. The Government has allowed the industry to raise capital by charging&#13;
higher prices to current consumers and placing these extra revenues in special "investment&#13;
funds." Thus the industry does not have to compete for capital on financial markets and, until&#13;
recently, has been accountable to no one for its use of this money.&#13;
(e) Distorted Pricing. Even though the electricity sector enjoys low labor, fuel and capital&#13;
costs, the price of electricity to the industrial and commercial sectors is equal to or higher than&#13;
that of many OECD countries. This is partially due to the high level of non-payment. Prices&#13;
are increased for those who do pay to compensate for those who don't which then encourages&#13;
nonpayment. Prices are further distorted because of cross subsidies between industry and&#13;
household consumers. Even though the cost of supplying industrial customers is below&#13;
households, industrial prices are 60 percent above the average while household prices are 60&#13;
percent below.&#13;
(f) Quality of Supply. The quality of the instrumentation and controls of the power system is&#13;
not up to the standards of the west. Frequency control is considerably below that of OECD&#13;
countries. As a result, transmission links to countries west of Russia require that a back-to-&#13;
back DC converter. Furthermore, as increased use of new technology increases in Russia,&#13;
consumers will demand improved quality of supply, as compensating for these problems at the&#13;
customer end is economically inefficient.&#13;
II. ELECTRICITY SECTOR REFORM&#13;
A.   History of Reform.&#13;
8.    The electricity sector lags behind most other sectors in terms of economic reform.&#13;
Though 70 percent of GDP is now produced in the private sector guided by competitive&#13;
market forces, the electricity sector remains largely majority owned by the state as a regulated&#13;
monopoly with little or no competition. Although this is the most common form of operation&#13;
of electricity sectors, globally, many countries have initiated reforms to decouple the&#13;
components of the sector that are not natural monopolies to enable competition. The&#13;
Government of Russia has recently committed to adopting this approach.&#13;
9.   In 1995 and 1996, the Bank supported the development of a concept for reform by the&#13;
Government. A PHRD grant funded a team of Russian consultants supplemented by Western&#13;
consultants, funded by USAID and the UK KnowHow Fund, to prepare a reform plan under&#13;
the guidance of a Government task force. Based on the work of this task force, the Govern-&#13;
ment adopted a concept for reform and restructuring of the sector in Decree No. 426 (April&#13;
28, 1997).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
10.   This concept for reform of the power sector along with reforms in other sectors would&#13;
be supported by a proposed Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL). The SAL has been prepared&#13;
in parallel with the IMF's Extended Fund Facility to ensure consistency and complementarity&#13;
between the macroeconomic program and structural reforms. The reforms of the power sector&#13;
that the Government has committed to under the SAL are (for details see Appendix 1):&#13;
Pricing. The Government's priority objective is to introduce pricing practices that will&#13;
encourage efficient production and usage. To this end, the Government will establish by June&#13;
30, 1997, principles and procedures for the pricing of electricity. The most acute pricing issue&#13;
are cross-subsidies which impose artificially high costs on industry while inefficiently&#13;
subsidizing households. The FEC has submitted a detailed proposal to decrease cross&#13;
subsidies, and by the end of July 1997, the Government will introduce a two-block tariff for&#13;
households.&#13;
Payment arrears. The Government's second objective is to reduce non-payment and non-cash&#13;
payments. In January 1997, the Government substantially reduced the list of "strategic&#13;
customers" whom energy providers had to supply even if they did not pay. The Government&#13;
has made adequate provision in the 1997 budget to pay for energy use by the remaining&#13;
strategic customers and will ensure that no arrears to energy suppliers result from their non-&#13;
payment.&#13;
Introducing competition: The third objective is to introduce competition in setting prices&#13;
where possible. To ensure the necessary restructuring of the sector, the Government took&#13;
steps in April 1997 to change management and improve government oversite of RAO. The&#13;
Government's program for the remainder of the year includes: (i) creating a non-profit&#13;
Wholesale Market Operator by September 30, 1997; (ii) making public, by the end of the&#13;
year, regulatory licenses for the participants in the wholesale market; and (iii) publishing a&#13;
plan to create independent generation companies in sufficient number for the functioning of a&#13;
competitive wholesale market by December 31, 1997.&#13;
Strengthening regulation. The fourth objective is to develop the institutional capacity of both&#13;
Federal and regional regulatory commissions so that they can effectively regulate those parts&#13;
of the sector that are unlikely to be competitive. This includes providing adequate financing&#13;
and office space and ensuring that officials are not allowed to receive financial consideration&#13;
from regulated companies.&#13;
B.   Government's Reform Concept&#13;
11.   The Government has adopted an ambitious concept for reform of the electricity sector&#13;
with the objective of improving its efficiency. The key elements of the concept are the&#13;
following:&#13;
Wholesale Market - The Government would establish competitive markets for the wholesale&#13;
trading of power in those regions in which such a market is, or can be made, feasible both&#13;
technical]Ly and economically. The price of electricity on the wholesale markets would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
based, to the extent possible, on competitive bidding. The Government would establish an&#13;
independent wholesale market operator that would organize and manage the market and&#13;
manage payments and settlements.&#13;
Restructuring - To encourage competition, the Government would restructure RAO, focusing&#13;
first on commercialization of the different operating units within RAO, and ultimately on&#13;
divesting the State's (RAO's) shares in generation and distribution. Arrangement for&#13;
divestiture would ensure that the rights and interests of existing private shareholders in these&#13;
entities were protected.&#13;
Regulation - The Government intends to improve the quality of government regulation and&#13;
control. Substantial institutional capacity building is planned for the Federal Energy Commis-&#13;
sion (FEC) and the Regional Energy Commissions (RECs). The FEC would both manage the&#13;
introduction of competition where feasible, ensure that the participants compete fairly&#13;
according to established rules, and develop sound systems of regulation for those parts of&#13;
industry that are not competitive. The Government also intends to enact legislation requiring&#13;
the regulators to set tariffs so that: (a) electricity sector companies recover all reasonable costs&#13;
of generation, transmission, and distribution; and (b) tariffs are differentiated according to&#13;
differences in cost of providing service thus eliminating cross-subsidies.&#13;
12.   Most industry and government officials seem to accept the basic approach to these&#13;
reforms, namely, to privatize sector companies, introduce competition where feasible and to&#13;
improve regulation of those segments where competition is not feasible. There remain some&#13;
unresolved issues, however, with respect to the appropriate schedule for implementing some&#13;
aspects of the reform concept, including preconditions which must be satisfied before some of&#13;
the changes are introduced. In addition, sector entities will need considerable institutional&#13;
strengthening to enable them to operate effectively in the proposed new environment. Finally,&#13;
as competitive markets are introduced and divestiture moves forward, the agencies responsible&#13;
for these activities will require support in planning and effecting the transitions. The&#13;
Government has therefore requested World Bank assistance, in the form of a technical&#13;
assistance project, to support the realization of electricity sector reform.&#13;
III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Description&#13;
13.   The objective of the proposed project is to lay the groundwork for improving the short-&#13;
and long-term efficiency of the Russian electricity sector, thereby ensuring the reliable supply&#13;
of electricity to customers at competitive prices. In this regard, the project is directed at&#13;
assisting the Government in further evaluating, elaborating and carrying out its proposed&#13;
reform of the electricity sector by supporting a program of Technical Assistance (TA) to&#13;
agencies and commercial enterprises involved in the reform process. The TA program would&#13;
also assist the Government in implementing the specific actions which it has committed to&#13;
under the SAL.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
14.   The project would finance foreign and Russian advisors to work with the various sector&#13;
entities and government agencies and with the Electricity Reform Implementation Unit (ERIU)&#13;
on implementation of the reform agenda. TA would fall into three broad categories: (a)&#13;
assistance to the Government in further refining and developing its concept for reform and&#13;
elaboraling a detailed implementation plan and schedule for realization of the reform concept,&#13;
including analyzing technical and institutional barriers to meeting the objectives and identify-&#13;
ing alternative solutions; (b) assistance in carrying out the activities necessary to implement&#13;
the plan; and, (c) support for the development of electricity sector entities, including corpora-&#13;
tization and commercialization of operating companies and institutional strengthening of the&#13;
regulators. It is envisaged that the assistance would be structured in a matrix fashion, with&#13;
advisors assigned to each of the sector entities or groups of entities, and other advisors&#13;
assigne(d to address cross-cutting issues such as training, public participation, and social&#13;
protection on behalf of all of the sector entities. Two advisors would work directly with the&#13;
ERIU: one to assist in policy analysis and elaboration of the reform plan, and a second to&#13;
assist in. project management and coordination. The main objectives and functions of each of&#13;
the advisory teams are outlined below. Draft Summary Scopes of Work are attached as&#13;
Appendix 2 and Terms of Reference for the four priority tasks are attached as Appendix 3.&#13;
15.   ][mplementation Management and Coordination  Advisors would support the ERIU&#13;
in coordinating the work of other consultants, government agencies, sector companies, and&#13;
donors, and in carrying out general project management activities including scheduling,&#13;
budgeting, procurement and disbursements.&#13;
16.   Policy Analysis and Development Advisors would assist the ERIU in analyzing&#13;
policy issues necessary to refine the Government's concept for restructuring the sector,&#13;
develop an action plan for realizing the concept, and modify the concept and action plan as&#13;
new issues arise during implementation.&#13;
17.   RAO Commercialization  About five separate teams of advisors would work with&#13;
RAO, to introduce efficient management practices, improve the quality of Government&#13;
supervision and control over the enterprise as long as it remains majority state owned, and&#13;
facilitate restructuring of the company, including possible divestiture of its subsidiaries. Focal&#13;
areas of the assistance would include:&#13;
(a) Accounting and Financial Controls: This component includes establishing systems to&#13;
provide critical financial data to senior management, evaluating and modernizing the sys-&#13;
tem of financial controls, developing a system of internal audits, and developing a system&#13;
of financial reporting.&#13;
(b) Economics and Investment: This component includes determining the nature and extent of&#13;
investment projects now in progress and proposed, implementing a system to evaluate and&#13;
conduct feasibility studies, and developing an investment plan for the company.&#13;
(c) Corporate Finance: This component would develop a sound financial strategy that would&#13;
allow the company to access capital markets. Specific tasks would include determining the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
company's cost of capital, developing relationships with various commercial and invest-&#13;
ment banks that can assist in executing the financial strategy, and providing financial in-&#13;
formation about the company to the investment public.&#13;
(d) Personnel and Staffing: This component includes assessing the skills and capabilities of&#13;
the existing staff, developing a compensation and benefits plan, and developing a promo-&#13;
tion and recruiting strategy.&#13;
(e) Forensic Accounting: This component would address, on a priority basis, the adequacy of&#13;
systems in place to control fraud and corruption, to identify and rectify major shortcom-&#13;
ings in the current procedures, and to assist in the development of procedures and controls&#13;
to reduce the risk of such behavior in the future.&#13;
18.   Transmission Network Commercialization and Restructuring  After the restructur-&#13;
ing of RAO, the high voltage transmission grid is expected to be established as a separate&#13;
commercial entity. Assistance would be provided to help this entity become a commercially&#13;
viable business. This would include developing the organizational structure for this entity,&#13;
developing a business and investment plan, negotiating a regulatory license with the FEC, and&#13;
negotiating transmission service agreements with the Market Operator. The role of the&#13;
transmission company in debottlenecking electricity flows will also be addressed.&#13;
19.   Generation Commercialization and Restructuring  Assistance would be provided to&#13;
create independent and viable generation companies composed of the existing generation&#13;
assets. This would include developing technical and economic criteria for the creation of the&#13;
Gencos, proposals for grouping the plants into companies, and the licenses under which the&#13;
new Gencos would be regulated by the FEC. To ensure the viability of these new companies,&#13;
assistance would be provided to commercialize their operations including developing organ-&#13;
izational plans, investment strategies, accounting systems, and so forth. Extensive training&#13;
would be provided to managers to prepare them for more market-oriented operation.&#13;
20.   Federal Energy Commission Institutional Development Assistance would be&#13;
provided to improve the internal operation of the FEC and its regulatory methodology. With&#13;
regard to operation, the Project would provide assistance for improving the organizational&#13;
structure, internal procedures, a business and management plan, physical infrastructure for&#13;
information gathering, and developing a policy analysis capability so that the FEC can develop&#13;
its own regulatory methodology. With regard to regulation, the Project would assist in&#13;
drafting licenses for participants in the wholesale market (generation, transmission, distribu-&#13;
tion, market operator, and nuclear plants), developing a wholesale market agreement that all&#13;
participants in the wholesale market would follow, and developing a price-setting methodology&#13;
for those sector components that are unlikely to be competitive (e.g. transmission and&#13;
distribution networks).&#13;
21.   Wholesale Market Operator Support This organization would manage the market&#13;
according to established rules, coordinate with the dispatch center to assure that plants are&#13;
dispatched according to market principles to the extent technically feasible, and organize the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
paymerLts and clearing function for wholesale transactions. The Project would assist in&#13;
determining: the physical infrastructure (communications, computers, software, etc.) required&#13;
for this task; the legal and organizational structure and funding of the new organization,&#13;
including the Supervisory Council that would represent the interests of participants in the&#13;
market;: and, methodologies and algorithms to price power on the wholesale market in&#13;
response to competitive bidding.&#13;
22.   Regional Energy Commission Institutional Development To provide examples of&#13;
excelleince for the other oblasts, RECs in approximately five oblasts would be selected for&#13;
more comprehensive assistance. This would include helping them develop efficient tariff&#13;
structures, regulatory methods and procedures for local electricity markets, a model organiza-&#13;
tional structure, model business plans, and regulatory methodologies and procedures. An&#13;
information dissemination program would be developed to transfer the lessons learned to other&#13;
RECs. The Project would also help to establish an association of RECs so that their views and&#13;
interests can be effectively presented at the national level.&#13;
23.   Regional Energo Commercialization  In-depth assistance would be provided to those&#13;
Energos in the same oblasts selected for in-depth assistance to the RECs, with lessons learned&#13;
disseminated to Energos in other regions. Assistance would cover such issues as organization,&#13;
business, financial, accounting, and investment planning so that the Energos become more&#13;
commercial and thus can compete as buyers or sellers in the markets for electricity. Assis-&#13;
tance would also be provided in negotiating and understanding regulatory licenses with the&#13;
FEC.&#13;
24.   In addition to the assistance specific to particular entities in the sector, general&#13;
assistanice would be provided to all the entities using consultants and advisors under the control&#13;
of the ]ERIU. This cross cutting assistance would be in five areas:&#13;
(a) Public Participation and Communications: The Project would assist in developing a public&#13;
relations and communications strategy and implementing that strategy. Given the size and&#13;
importance of this reform effort, the Government must be able to explain effectively the&#13;
goads of the effort, likely benefits, and the impact on employees, consumers, federal and&#13;
local government officials, and private shareholders with the objectives of mobilizing&#13;
support for the program and ensuring that stakeholder concerns are adequately addressed.&#13;
(b) Coimpensation: An issue affecting all entities is the level and structure of compensation.&#13;
As noted above, wages have increased faster in this sector than in others suggesting over&#13;
cornpensation. However, if salaries are still below those in comparable firms in other&#13;
sectors, this can lead to corruption as staff attempt to supplement their salaries. Also the&#13;
regulatory agencies must assure themselves that salaries are not excessively high leading to&#13;
unreasonable prices paid by consumers. The Compensation Advisor would assist in de-&#13;
terirnining the optimal structure and level of compensation across all entities including&#13;
regulatory agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(c) Training: While some of the training of staff in sector organizations would be done on the&#13;
job as the staff worked closely with advisors, some formal training would also be needed.&#13;
A Training Advisor would assist in conducting a needs analysis, formulating a training&#13;
strategy for staff in sector organizations, coordinating tailored and well-targeted training&#13;
for government and sector managers and staff on both cross-cutting reform issues and&#13;
organization-specific topics as needed. The Training Advisor would also be responsible&#13;
for developing an evaluation and monitoring program to assess training effectiveness.&#13;
(d) Ethics: A widespread problem is unethical behavior, corruption, and conflicts of interest&#13;
by sector employees both in government agencies and companies. The Project would&#13;
provide assistance in developing guidelines, principles, procedures, enforcement mecha-&#13;
nisms, and training to sector organizations on improving ethical standards of staff.&#13;
(e) Downsizing and Social Assistance: Since corporatization and commercialization is likely to&#13;
lead to labor retrenchment, the Project would assist in designing retraining, severance, and&#13;
a variety of tailored downsizing assistance programs for sector employees. In addition, the&#13;
proposed restructuring of tariffs to reduce residential subsidies could lead to instances of&#13;
hardship to low income households. Advisors would work with local governments and&#13;
RECs to design and implement targeted assistance to low-income households to ensure&#13;
affordability of electricity supply.&#13;
(f) Legal: Commercialization of the sector will require significant legal and regulatory work&#13;
including the establishment of new legal entities and competition and anti-trust legislation&#13;
and the possible establishment of an Electricity Law. The Project would fund relevant&#13;
legal support during the reform process and help to establish a legal framework suitable for&#13;
a more commercially-oriented electricity sector.&#13;
25.   Other Bilateral financing will also be sought to support the corporatization of the&#13;
nuclear power plants, to improve their efficiency and to assist them in adapting to a competi-&#13;
tive market for electricity. Proposed assistance would focus on the commercialization and&#13;
training of staff, developing a business and investment plan, finding ways to reduce costs&#13;
while maintaining adequate safety, and negotiation of licenses and contracts to supply&#13;
electricity to the wholesale market.&#13;
B.    Cost Estimate and Financing Plan&#13;
26.   Cost Estimate: The total estimated cost of the technical support project is estimated at&#13;
US$70.3 million, of which approximately US$43.9 million (62 percent) is foreign exchange&#13;
requirements. Table 2 shows a breakdown of the cost by major component. Contingencies of&#13;
10 percent have been included in the estimate of items to be financed by the Bank loan, and of&#13;
the contributions by government and sector agencies with respect to counterpart staff.&#13;
27.   Financing Plan: A World Bank loan for US$40.0 million equivalent would be&#13;
extended to finance selected consultant contracts, as well as computer and communications&#13;
equipment for government and operating agencies. In addition, the Federal Center for Project&#13;

Finance has approved a Project Development Loan of US$5.4 million (under the Portfolio&#13;
Development Loan, L-38440) to finance further development of Terms of Reference (TORs)&#13;
as well as the establishment of the project implement unit (the ERIU). Additional cofinancing&#13;
would be provided on a grant basis to undertake specific items of work from USAID (US$8.7&#13;
million), the UK KnowHow Fund (US$2.4 million), and EU-TACIS (US$1.6 million), under&#13;
ongoing and committed programs. The beneficiaries (Government, regulatory agencies and&#13;
operating entities) would finance taxes as well as the salaries and overheads associated with&#13;
counterpart staff. Total value of the beneficiaries' contributions is estimated at US$12.1&#13;
million equivalent.&#13;
IV. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A.   Project Implementation&#13;
28.   Project Implementation: The ERIU, which has been established to further develop and&#13;
implement the reform program in the electricity sector, would be responsible for the day to&#13;
day implementation of the technical assistance program, including the Bank-financed compo-&#13;
nents (Figure 3). The Unit would employ a full-time Director and 10-15 local staff. The&#13;
ERIU would be assisted by an Implementation Management and Coordination Advisor who&#13;
would provide support in project coordination, management and procurement. The ERIU&#13;
would operate under the oversight of the Inter-Ministerial Working Group for Electricity&#13;
Sector Reforns (IMWG), which would provide overall guidance, establish priorities, approve&#13;
changes in the reform plan recommended by the rest of the reform team, and recommend to&#13;
the Government new policies, laws, or decrees needed to implement the reform plan. An&#13;
international panel of experts, with experience in carrying out electricity sector reform and&#13;
restructuring in other countries, would provide general policy advice and guidance to the&#13;
IMWG. The Board would report to the First Deputy Prime Minister responsible for the&#13;
reform of natural monopolies who would carry overall responsibility for the project.&#13;
B.   Schedule&#13;
29.   The project would be implemented over a three year period, beginning July of 1997&#13;
and extending into mid-2000. The initial focus would be to procure the services of the&#13;
Implementation Management and Coordination Advisors, to provide early assistance to the&#13;
ERIU, particularly with respect to scheduling and initial procurement, and to finalize and issue&#13;
bid documents for four priority teams of advisors which are to be financed under the loan.&#13;
Draft TORs for these four teams are attached as Appendix 3. At the same time, bilateral&#13;
cofinancing programs would be directed towards institutional support for the Federal Energy&#13;
Commission, the Wholesale Market Operator, and a pilot support project in one or more of the&#13;
regions to address institutional strengthening of the regional regulators and Energos.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13 -&#13;
30.    In parallel, the IMWG and ERIU&#13;
will be working with the Panel of Experts                Figure 3: Project Structure&#13;
to identify outstanding issues which need                         First Deputy Prime Minister&#13;
to be addressed before finalizing the                          Responsible for Natural Monopolies&#13;
reform plan, so that the necessary                International Panel of Experts&#13;
research can move forward with the&#13;
assistarnce of the Policy Advisor team.                         Inter-Ministerial Working Group&#13;
Once the proposed market and institu-                               for Electricity Reform&#13;

and Guidelines for procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, published by the World&#13;
Bank in January 1995 (The Guidelines). The proposed procurement arrangements are&#13;
summarized in Table 3.&#13;
32.   Goods: Goods to be procured would consist of office equipment to support effective&#13;
communications. The largest package is expected to be less than US$250,000, while the&#13;
aggregate is estimated to be US$3.3 million. All goods would be procured through national&#13;
shopping.&#13;
33.   Consulting Services and Training: Firms and individuals would be selected for&#13;
consulting assignments in accordance with the Bank's Consultant Guidelines. A panel of&#13;
experts would be engaged to advise the highest levels of the Government. Given that there are&#13;
very few countries that have undertaken a similar level of reforms, the number of highly&#13;
qualified experts in this field is few and their availability is limited. The Government would&#13;
canvas those that have had direct experience in guiding a similar reform agenda to advise them&#13;
of possible problems. Hence, the Expert Panel, and any other similarly justified engagements,&#13;
would be undertaken on a sole source basis. The aggregate value of individual contracts&#13;
would not exceed US$2.5 million. All other consultant assignments would be contracted&#13;
according to shortlisting procedures. The TORs for all assignments would be subject to the&#13;
Bank's prior review.&#13;
34.   Procurement Implementation and Monitoring Arrangements: A project launch seminar&#13;
is scheduled for July 1997 at which time an attempt would be made to quantify the agreed&#13;
project indicators. A procurement specialist would be engaged to work within the ERIU to&#13;
control the procurement process. All contracts for consulting firms at US$100,000 and for&#13;
US$50,000 or more for individual consultants, and all single source contracts, would be&#13;
subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. Information on procurement would be&#13;
collected and recorded by the ERIU to provide: (a) prompt reporting of contract awards by the&#13;
Borrower; (b) full quarterly reports to the Bank; and, (c) changes in procurement schedules,&#13;
including advertising, bidding, contract awards and completion dates. A procurement&#13;
schedule outlining the target dates for the procurement milestones for the first year is attached&#13;
as Appendix 5.&#13;
D.   Disbursement&#13;
35.   Proposed disbursement arrangements are shown in Table 4. A Special Account (SA)&#13;
would be established in accordance with World Bank procedures, with an initial allocation of&#13;
US$500,000. When the aggregate disbursements under the Loan have reached the level of&#13;
US$2.5 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of US$1&#13;
million by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications&#13;
would be submitted at least every three months, and would include reconciled bank statements&#13;
as well as other appropriate supporting documents. The minimum application size for&#13;
payments directly from the loan account or for issuance of Special Commitments would be 20&#13;
percent of the SA authorized allocation; that is, US$100,000 until aggregate disbursements&#13;
reach US$2.5 million and US$200,000 thereafter. Minimum application size prior to the&#13;

documented, except for expenditures against training and (a) goods and services of consulting&#13;
firms under contracts not exceeding US$100,000 equivalent; and (b) services of individual&#13;
consultants under contracts not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent, which would be made on the&#13;
basis of SOEs detailing the individual transactions. Documentation supporting these expendi-&#13;
tures would be held by the ERIU for at least one year after receipt of the audit report by the&#13;
Bank for the year in which the last disbursement is made and would be made available for&#13;
review lby the auditors and to the Bank on request.&#13;
36.   The project would be carried out over a 3-year period. Disbursements are heavily&#13;
concentrated in the first two years, with 32 percent of the loan amount disbursed during FY98,&#13;
and a further 49 percent disbursed in FY99 (see Table 5). The project is expected to be&#13;
completed by June 30, 2000, with a closing date for the loan of December 31, 2000.&#13;
E.   Supervision&#13;
37.   Project Supervision: Due to the scope and urgency of this project, a significant&#13;
supervision effort is anticipated. An estimated 2-3 staff conducting on-site monitoring on a&#13;
quarterly basis would be required. The possibility exists, and would need to be examined, of&#13;
a need for full-time presence in the field. In addition, semi-annual project reviews would be&#13;
carried out to ensure that activities are being carried out in accordance with the overall&#13;
objectives of the Technical Assistance program, and are yielding the expected results.&#13;

38.   Monitorable Indicators: The Borrower has agreed to establish policies and procedures&#13;
adequate to allow ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the execution of the project and the&#13;
achievement of the objectives. Monitorable indicators would be agreed with the Bank.&#13;
Performance indicators would include: (a) adequate staffing of the ERIU; (b) availability of&#13;
funds; (c) engagement of advisors; (d) cost control of consultants; and, (e) implementation of&#13;
an effective management information system. Development indicators would include: (a) a&#13;
reduction in accounts receivable; (b) an increase in the proportion of cash payments; (c) the&#13;
establishment of effective regulation at the federal and regional levels; (d) the establishment of&#13;
effective information systems for the regulator; (e) the publishing of commercial licenses for&#13;
entities operating in the wholesale market by December 31, 1997; and, (f) the establishment of&#13;
an independent nonprofit wholesale market operator by September 30, 1997.&#13;
39.   The Borrower has also agreed to prepare twice-yearly reports to the Bank (on March&#13;
31 and September 30), outlining the progress achieved during the preceding period with&#13;
respect to the monitorable indicators, and setting out measures to be taken during the coming&#13;
period to ensure efficient execution and achievement of objectives. The Borrower has further&#13;
agreed to review project progress with the Bank by April 30 and October 31 of each year and&#13;
take the Bank's views into account in project implementation.&#13;
V.   PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.   Benefits&#13;
40.   The proposed reform initiatives are expected to result in substantial benefits to the&#13;
Russian economy. These include: (a) reductions in the fuel-related cost of electricity supply&#13;
as a result of more economic dispatch of plants, (estimated at as much as US$1 billion per year&#13;
by the Russian Institute of Energy Research); (b) reductions in system operating and mainte-&#13;
nance costs as a result of better regulatory oversight, improved corporate management, and&#13;
competitive pressures; (c) increased value of the Government shareholdings in sector&#13;
companies as a result of reduced regulatory risk, more efficient operation, and thus improved&#13;
profitability; (d) decreased investment needs through better use of existing assets (estimated to&#13;
save at least $1 billion per year over the medium term); (e) improved customer service; and,&#13;
(f) economic benefits related to the elimination of cross-subsidies and non-payments.&#13;
41.   Reforming the sector would also have environmental benefits. By improving the&#13;
pricing structure, consumers would have a greater incentive to conserve on the use of&#13;
electricity and reduce waste and inefficiency. By increasing the profitability of sector&#13;

companiies, they would be able to decrease their cost of capital. Competitive and regulatory&#13;
pressures to reduce costs should increase fuel efficiency in generation.&#13;
B.    Risks and Risk Mitigation&#13;
42.   While the project offers substantial benefits, it carries correspondingly high risks and&#13;
an equally high profile. Government commitment to reform is of recent origin and may not be&#13;
sustained long enough to allow full realization of the concept and hence the expected efficiency&#13;
gains. This project has, therefore, been prepared quickly to respond to what is viewed as a&#13;
window of opportunity to broaden and deepen the reform agenda. Project preparation has&#13;
focused on speed in the trade-off between speed and attention to detail. However, because of&#13;
the unique opportunity, this approach is felt to be appropriate. The proposed project is&#13;
attempting to address this risk by providing immediate and extensive support to the program&#13;
and by concentrating initially on areas which would yield large, early, and visible gains in&#13;
terms of efficiency improvements. Risks related specifically to the technical assistance include&#13;
the difficulties in coordinating and absorbing assistance of this magnitude, and the difficulties&#13;
in predicting and monitoring the effectiveness of programs with extensive training compo-&#13;
nents. Coordination has been addressed through the establishment of a high-level, knowledge-&#13;
able Inter-Ministerial Working Group within the Government to oversee the project, supported&#13;
by a panel of international experts to advise on policy matters, and by an implementation&#13;
advisory team that will assist the ERIU in project coordination. Training risks would be&#13;
addressedl by providing a combination of long-term on-the-job assistance coupled with formal&#13;
training programs, by a preliminary needs assessment, and by careful selection of training&#13;
candidates. Training performance indicators would be agreed at an early date and monitored&#13;
closely. In addition, the Bank would provide extra resources to ensure adequate supervision of&#13;
the project.&#13;

PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN&#13;
1.    Objectives. The proposed SAL would assist the Government to undertake the structural&#13;
reformis necessary to the lay the foundation for renewed economic growth and to maintain&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization over the medium-term. It would also provide the financing&#13;
necessary to provide an adequate level of public services during the difficult fiscal transition&#13;
that has characterized most centrally planned economies. It would focus on private sector&#13;
development, natural monopoly regulation and restructuring, banking, and fiscal management.&#13;
The following describes the reforms of the natural monopolies and, in particular, the power&#13;
sector, that would be supported by the proposed loan.&#13;
2.    Coordination with the IMF. The proposed SAL has been prepared in parallel with the&#13;
1997 IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in the context of an intensive tripartite dialogue&#13;
between the Bank, IMF, and the Russian authorities to ensure consistency and complementar-&#13;
ity between the macroeconomic program and structural reforms with the Bank and the Fund&#13;
taking the lead in the structural and macroeconomics areas, respectively. As a result, the&#13;
Goverfnment's structural reform program for 1997 is equally reflected in the Letter of&#13;
Development Policy for the SAL and the Statement of Economic Policies for the EFF.&#13;
3.    Conte-xt. Price reforms and the competitive restructuring of natural monopoly services&#13;
in the electricity, gas, and railways sectors will have very substantial efficiency gains with&#13;
large, positive, economy-wide spillovers and will be critically important for medium-term&#13;
growth. Natural monopoly reforms need to focus on four areas: (a) pricing should better&#13;
reflect cost and demand conditions; (b) arrears should be reduced and payment discipline&#13;
strengt]ened (especially in the energy sector); (c) arms-length regulatory oversight, where&#13;
appropriate, should be enhanced; and (d) sectors should be demonopolized, i.e., policy&#13;
barriers to new entry should be reduced so as to allow for the competitive provision of&#13;
services where monopoly is not "natural." The Government has initiated reform steps in all&#13;
four areas. The 1997 reform program will concentrate mainly on price reform, continue to&#13;
address the arrears problem and strengthen needed regulatory oversight, and develop the&#13;
agenda for, and in some cases implement, the restructuring process of demonopolization.&#13;
4.    Russia's power sector has an installed generating capacity of about 215 GW, nearly&#13;
50% more than the peak demand. This condition resulted from the decline in demand of about&#13;
20% over the past five years. The asset base is aging and considerable investment in deferred&#13;
maintenance, life extension and replacement will be needed over the next decade. Despite the&#13;
over-capacity situation, supply problems persist in some regions due to the huge buildup of&#13;
paymernt arrears. The arrears problem also manifests itself in non-payments to the Govern-&#13;
ment as the power sector owes 9.5 trillion rubles to local and federal budgets and 1.7 trillion&#13;
rubles to the state pension fund.&#13;
5.    The power sector is largely controlled by the corporate entity RAO EES Rossii (RAO).&#13;
RAO owns much of the generation system, and all of the transmission and dispatch systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20-&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
Page 2&#13;
RAO also has a controlling equity stake in most of the regional electricity monopolies&#13;
(Energos), which are responsible for the distribution of electricity on a regional basis. The 72&#13;
Energos own the smaller generation stations and the distribution networks within their regions.&#13;
Regulation has recently been established at both the federal and regional levels. However, the&#13;
institutional capacity and independence of the regulators is weak.&#13;
6.    In 1992 the Government partially privatized the power sector under its mass privatiza-&#13;
tion program. RAO was established as a holding company for the Energos, with an ownership&#13;
stake of 51% in the majority of them. The remaining 49% is owned by the employees and&#13;
management of the Energos. Only a small share of RAO was initially privatized in 1992, with&#13;
the Government gradually selling off further stock and reducing its ownership stake to the&#13;
present level of 52 percent. The Russian stock market has assigned a low value to all of the&#13;
Russian power sector entities, relative to similar entities abroad, with a much higher value&#13;
assigned to many of the Energos than it has to RAO. Brokers ascribe this low valuation to a&#13;
lack of confidence in existing management, lack of transparency, weak regulation and large&#13;
arrears (less than three quarters of electricity and heat bills were collected in 1996).&#13;
7.    In the aggregate, electricity prices have been set at a level to fully finance operating&#13;
costs and 100% of new investments. However, rates charged to households (where demand is&#13;
relatively inelastic) have been kept artificially low at about 25% of the cost of supply, while&#13;
prices to industry (where demand is elastic) have been set high in order to cross-subsidize&#13;
household consumption. This structure of prices is economically inefficient: the weighted&#13;
average tariff for industrial users is too high given the low cost of fuel, low labor costs and a&#13;
nearly zero cost of capital (as much of the asset base was originally funded as a budget&#13;
transfer). Moreover, while this price structure is intended to achieve equity and reduce&#13;
poverty, these objectives would be better met through targeted direct transfers as part of the&#13;
authorities' overall social programs or, where adequate targeting of transfers is impossible to&#13;
implement under present conditions, through instruments such as life-line pricing.&#13;
8.    The Government has assigned a high priority to addressing the problems of the power&#13;
sector. The goal of the program is to increase the efficiency of the sector's operation by&#13;
establishing a pattern of prices reflecting economic costs and relative scarcities (demand and&#13;
supply over time), improving regulatory oversight, improving the quality of service, and&#13;
operational restructuring. The Bank is providing technical assistance to the Government to&#13;
help define and implement a comprehensive reform agenda along these lines. The reforms&#13;
include the establishment of a competitive market for electricity, where feasible, comple-&#13;
mented by enhancing the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for the segments of the power&#13;
market where the competitive provision of service is suboptimal.   Structural, financial,&#13;
institutional capacity building and ownership issues will all be addressed under these reforms.&#13;
9.    Price Reform. The Government's priority objective in natural monopoly reform is to&#13;
introduce pricing practices for electricity, gas, and rail services that will encourage efficient&#13;
production and usage. A fundamental issue the Government must face in this regard is that&#13;
pricing in natural monopolies is based on Soviet-style accounting, which fails to appropriately&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
Page 3&#13;
treat key cost components such as depreciation and prevents providers from recovering the&#13;
actual cost of service. In response to this, the Government will attempt to move toward&#13;
modem pricing principles used in market economies.&#13;
10.   The Government committed to price reform in the natural monopoly industries in its&#13;
Medium-Term Program. By June 30, 1997, the Government will establish principles and&#13;
procedures for the pricing of electricity, natural gas, and railways services. With a view to&#13;
encouraging efficient production and usage of these services, these pricing principles will: (i)&#13;
allow suppliers to recover prudently incurred fixed and variable costs; (ii) reflect differences in&#13;
cost between customer classes and geographic regions; and (iii) over time adjust to reflect the&#13;
evolution of costs and demand conditions. To facilitate effective regulation, detailed price&#13;
reform studies have been initiated for each subsector, and the Government will prepare a list&#13;
of information and reporting requirements for the regulated entities (including details on&#13;
proposed investment and the structure and cost of financing).&#13;
11.   Cross-subsidies are currently the most acute pricing issue. They impose artificially&#13;
high costs on industrial production while inefficiently subsidizing households.  Under its&#13;
natural monopoly reform program supported by the SAL, the Government approved in early&#13;
April 1997 an ambitious action plan for the phased elimination of cross-subsidies among&#13;
consumer groups for all natural monopoly services (GoR Resolution No. 389). In addition,&#13;
the FEC submitted to the Government a detailed proposal to decrease cross-subsidies for&#13;
electricity consumption. By the end of July 1997, the Government will introduce a two-block&#13;
tariff for household electricity consumption.&#13;
12.   Elimination of cross-subsidization will lead to further increases in energy prices and&#13;
railway tariffs paid by households. This may have a substantial poverty impact. To mitigate&#13;
this the Government has mandated municipal authorities to set housing allowances programs&#13;
which aire to provide targeted mean-tested income transfers to families with housing expendi-&#13;
tures exceeding 15% of their gross money income. Most municipalities have been running&#13;
such programs since 1995.  In addition, to improve local capacity for delivering social&#13;
assistance, the Government has decided recently to pilot a few alternative schemes for&#13;
administering universal mean-tested poverty benefits. These pilots will be supported through&#13;
the Bank's proposed Social Protection Assistance Adjustment Loan.&#13;
13.   Reducing Payment Arrears. The Government's second objective is to reduce payment&#13;
arrears on electricity and natural gas utility bills and improve the flow of payments in the fuel&#13;
and energy sector. Energy providers are faced with the problem of being unable to cut off&#13;
supply to so-called "strategic customers;" such customers can still obtain services even if they&#13;
are in arrears. This has created a chain of payment arrears which have multiplied through the&#13;
economy and has also led to increased tax arrears to the budget. The arrears have also in&#13;
many cases seriously affected the financial viability of local utility companies. The original&#13;
list of "strategic customers" was long and included defense-related as well as many other&#13;
companies. In January 1997 the Government substantially reduced the list of "strategic&#13;
customers"; entities taken off the list account for the large bulk of all energy deliveries to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1                             - 22 -&#13;
Page 4&#13;
"strategic customers" as previously defined. Virtually all remaining "strategic customers" are&#13;
entities responsible for Russia's external and internal security. Earlier legal provisions that&#13;
prohibited suppliers form cutting off service to classes of customers have also been revoked,&#13;
including most recently provisions under Government Resolution No. 307 of April 7, 1994.&#13;
14.   Additionally, the Government will use the regulatory process and corporate governance&#13;
mechanisms to encourage strict enforcement of payment discipline. To improve the flow of&#13;
payments and reduce arrears in the energy sector, the Government has made adequate&#13;
provisions in the 1997 budget to pay for the fuel and energy consumption of the remaining&#13;
"strategic customers" who may not be disconnected for nonpayment, as listed in Government&#13;
Decree 74, issued January 28, 1997. The Government will ensure that there are no arrears to&#13;
energy suppliers on account of the remaining strategic customers.&#13;
15.   Introducing Competition Where Monopoly is Not "Natural. " The Government's third&#13;
objective is to promote more competitive market structures for the energy and infrastructure&#13;
industries. To be sure, throughout the world many of these industries were once thought to be&#13;
naturally monopolistically structured. But due to changes in technology and expansion of&#13;
markets, today many of these industries increasingly possess competitive attributes. As a&#13;
result, services can be provided more efficiently when there are multiple suppliers rather than&#13;
a single supplier. In Russia, the electricity, gas, and rail sectors are dominated by vertically&#13;
integrated monopoly providers who are in a position to inflate costs, overprice services, and&#13;
restrict network access.  To help rectify this, the Government will begin a step-by-step&#13;
restructuring of these industries with a view to demonopolization and eventual privatization of&#13;
competitive segments.   An Interministerial Commission under the former Minister of&#13;
Economy completed a reporta in early 1997 with specific recommendations for restructuring&#13;
the electricity, natural gas, and railways sectors. On April 28, 1997, Presidential Decree No.&#13;
426 was issued adopting the structural reform principles for the electricity, natural gas, and&#13;
railways sectors for 1997 as outlined in that report. The decree instructs the Government to&#13;
elaborate a detailed medium-term restructuring program to be adopted by a government&#13;
resolution by June 30, 1997.&#13;
16.  In the power sector, the formation of a joint stock company to develop a new generat-&#13;
ing plant, with equity participation by several enterprises, including non-power sector entities&#13;
(mostly completed) is a first step in the establishment of a competitive power market. The&#13;
Moscow regional power company (MosEnergo), and recently an increasing number of other&#13;
regional power utilities, issued ADRs and to this end have begun complying with stricter and&#13;
more transparent reporting (particularly financial) requirements. In April, 1997, the Govern-&#13;
ment took steps to change the management of RAO EES Rossii and to ensure that the&#13;
representative group of interministerial officials on the Board of RAO have clear instructions&#13;
to implement governmental policies in the electric power sector (Government Resolutions No.&#13;
' "On Developing Plans for Structural Reforms of Natural Monopolies" submitted to the Government in&#13;
draft on January 28, 1997 and in final on March 26, 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 5&#13;
401 of April 1, 1997 and No. 439 of April 22, 1997). The Government has outlined the&#13;
following program for the remainder of the year:&#13;
a.    By September 30, 1997, the Government will issue a resolution to create an&#13;
independent non-profit Wholesale Market Operator to operate the wholesale electricity&#13;
market, including the dispatch of electricity from generators and the settlement and&#13;
clearance of payments, and the Government will establish a Supervisory Council for&#13;
the Wholesale Market composed of representatives of market participants (with no par-&#13;
ticipant having a dominant position). By September 30, 1997, the FEC will also make&#13;
public a Wholesale Market Agreement which specifies the duties and responsibilities of&#13;
the participants in the wholesale market.&#13;
b.    By June 30, 1997, the Government will outline general principles (based on a&#13;
report by the FEC) for the commercial licensing of enterprises participating in the&#13;
wholesale market. By August 30, 1997, the Government will issue a resolution giving&#13;
the FEC exclusive authority to issue such licenses. By September 30, 1997, the Gov-&#13;
ernment will solicit public comments on drafts of each type of license and by December&#13;
31, 1997, it will make final versions public.&#13;
c.    By December 31, 1997, the Government will publish a plan to create a suffi-&#13;
cient number of generation companies independent of RAO EES Rossii to establish a&#13;
competitive wholesale market.&#13;
17.   Strengthening Regulation.  The Government's fourth objective is to develop the&#13;
institutional capacity for effective independent regulatory oversight of natural monopoly&#13;
sectors.  This process will take time.  Regulatory Commissions have been established&#13;
throughout the energy, transport, and telecommunications sectors. But the clout of these&#13;
agencies remains weak. The Government has plans to further strengthen and ensure the&#13;
independence of these commissions, beginning with those in the energy sector; a proposed&#13;
Bank TA loan in the power sector is under preparation to assist with this task. The ground-&#13;
work has been laid in the Government's budget to enable the FEC to raise staffing levels&#13;
closer to mandated levels.&#13;

SUMMARY SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION POLICY ADVICE&#13;
Objective:&#13;
To support the Electricity Reform Implementation Unit (ERIU) in analyzing policy&#13;
issues necessary to refine the Government's concept for restructuring the sector, develop a&#13;
plan for realizing the concept, and modify the concept and plan as new issues arise during&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Tasks:&#13;
Assist the ERIU to further refine and modify if necessary the Government's concept for&#13;
restructuring as specified in Decree 426 of April 28, 1997. Issues to be analyzed include:&#13;
O an assessment of which regional generation markets are, or can be made competi-&#13;
tive, based on an analysis of system technical and market characteristics, including&#13;
technical features of the transmission grid and system dispatch system that limit&#13;
competition on the wholesale market,&#13;
O macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions which need to be in place to allow&#13;
for the effective functioning of competitive markets,&#13;
O procedures for generation companies to submit bids and determining market clearing&#13;
prices in those generation markets likely to be competitive,&#13;
O requirements with respect to participation in the market, including an evaluation of&#13;
regulations that would encourage or require combined heat and power plants owned&#13;
by the Energos to participate in the wholesale market,&#13;
O methodology for regulating wholesale market prices in those regional generation&#13;
markets that will not be competitive,&#13;
O the feasibility of separating the generation, marketing, and distribution activities of&#13;
the Energos or other proposals designed to introduce competition in local power&#13;
markets,&#13;
O pricing for transmission services that are consistent with regional differences in the&#13;
wholesale market price and provide the proper incentives to generation companies,&#13;
O the appropriate role of nuclear and large hydro plants in the wholesale market, in-&#13;
cluding whether the ownership of hydro plants should remain with the transmission&#13;
grid to assure system reliability,&#13;
O the number and structure of generation companies necessary to create competitive&#13;
markets, and&#13;
O the appropriate legal form and ownership of the Wholesale Market Operator and the&#13;
Supervisory Council.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
ELECTRICITY SECTOR REFORM SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
In 1992, the Russian Government carried out a partial restructuring of the power&#13;
sector, establishing RAO EES Rossii (RAO) as a nation wide holding company for government&#13;
stakeholdings in generation, transmission and distribution assets. At the same time, local&#13;
distribution companies (Energos) were established in each region, retaining ownership of the&#13;
smaller generating plants, and supplying both electricity and heat, on a monopoly basis, to&#13;
final consumers. While the industry structure has successfully maintained reliable power&#13;
supply during a difficult economic period, a number of deficiencies have come to light with&#13;
respect to the manner in which the sector now operates. These include high operating costs,&#13;
inadequate cash generation, and inadequate investment to meet current and expected needs. In&#13;
order to address these shortcomings, the Government has adopted a concept for the reform and&#13;
restructuring of the power sector and has requested a loan from the World Bank to finance&#13;
technical assistance in support of further developing and implementing a restructuring&#13;
implementation plan. A Supervisory Board on Electricity Reform has been established under&#13;
the First D)eputy Prime Minister in charge of Natural Monopolies, to provide oversight and&#13;
policy guidance to the process. In addition, an Electricity Reform Implementation Unit&#13;
(ERIU) is being established to manage the review and implementation process, and at the same&#13;
time to manage the technical assistance which will be provided.&#13;
The overall scale of the technical assistance is substantial. Total cost is estimated at&#13;
approximately US$70 million. Direct and indirect loans from the World Bank would finance&#13;
approximately US$45 million; bilateral and multilateral agencies would provide grant&#13;
financing for approximately US$13 million; and the Russian Government and sector agencies&#13;
would coiltribute the remaining US$12 million. Sixteen separate areas of support have been&#13;
identified., including support for the corporatization and commercialization of sector operating&#13;
companies, for institutional strengthening of the regulatory agencies, for development of&#13;
power market institutions, and for advice on a range of cross-cutting issues such as training,&#13;
public participation, and social impact analysis and mitigation. Management, coordination,&#13;
and execution of this program will require substantial effort. For this reason, provision has&#13;
been made to finance assistance to the ERIU in these efforts.&#13;
OBJECTIVE&#13;
ThLe objective of the assignment is to assist the ERIU in managing the components of&#13;
the technical assistance project which are being financed by the World Bank loan, and&#13;
coordinating the efforts of both Bank-financed and donor-financed advisory teams to ensure&#13;
that all issues are covered in a consistent and cost-effective manner.&#13;

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS - RAO EES ROSSII&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
RAO EES Rossii (RAO) was established in 1992, as part of the Government's partial&#13;
restructutring of the power sector, to serve as a nation wide holding company for government&#13;
stakeholdings in generation, transmission and distribution assets. RAO was given ownership&#13;
of the high voltage transmission grid, large thermal and hydropower plants, dispatch centers,&#13;
and rese,arch and design institutes. Regional Energos retained ownership of the smaller&#13;
combined heat and power and hydro plants (which constitute approximately 40 percent of&#13;
system capacity), and became local distribution/generation companies, supplying both&#13;
electricity and heat, on a monopoly basis, to final consumers. The nuclear plants remained in&#13;
the ownership of the Government, and were placed under the management of Rosenergoatom..&#13;
In addition, the Energos were instructed to transfer 49 percent of their equity to RAOG. Total&#13;
value of RAO's assets (including its interests in the Energos) is estimated to be approximately&#13;
US$2 billion. The Government has since sold a part of their shareholdings in RAO, and&#13;
currentl) holds approximately 52 percent.&#13;
In the period since the initial restructuring, a number of deficiencies have come to light&#13;
with respect to the manner in which the sector is operating. These include high operating&#13;
costs, inadequate cash generation, and inadequate investment to meet current and expected&#13;
needs. In order to address these shortcomings, the Government has adopted a concept for the&#13;
reform and restructuring of the power sector and has requested a loan from the World Bank to&#13;
finance technical assistance that will, among other things, support the corporatization and&#13;
commercialization of power sector entities to enable them to operate more efficiently both in&#13;
the current environment and as commercial entities within the proposed new sector structure.&#13;
A part of the proceeds of this loan would be used to finance the present assignment. An&#13;
outline of the general organization and structure of the reform support program is attached.&#13;
OBJECTIVE&#13;
Despite its broad ranging responsibilities and interests, RAO's systems of financial&#13;
reporting and controls are not up to modern standards. This hinders management's ability to&#13;
properly plan and manage cash flows, to understand where and how monies are being&#13;
expended, and to control losses and inefficiencies within its various operating divisions. The&#13;
objective of this study is to assist RAO in designing and implementing financial information&#13;
systems and controls which will meet modern international standards. The initial focus of the&#13;
b Five Energos failed to comply fully with the decree - two remained fully independent and three transferred less&#13;
than 49 percent of their shareholdings. RAO has since increased its ownership stake in most of the other Energos,&#13;
and now holds more than 49 percent of 53 Energos (including 100 percent of 9 Energos).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

OBJECTIVE&#13;
Prior to the initial restructuring of the sector, planning for capital investments was&#13;
carried out by the Government, and resources were allocated from the budget to finance&#13;
approved projects. Since the formation of RAO, resources have continued to be spent, as&#13;
available, on ongoing projects. However, little has been done in the way of a comprehensive&#13;
review of these or other planned investments to ensure that available funds are being allocated&#13;
in an appropriate fashion and that planned new investments are optimal given the changes in&#13;
market conditions. The objectives of the proposed study are: (a) to develop a coherent picture&#13;
of current investments, both under way and planned; (b) to assist in updating the investment&#13;

plan, including the assignment of priorities; (c) to assist in developing a financing plan for the&#13;
proposed investment program to ensure that adequate funding is available; and, (d) to assist&#13;
RAO in developing the capabilities necessary to ensure that future investments are financially&#13;
and economically viable.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
Task 1:     Review of Current Investments: The advisor will carry out a comprehensive&#13;
review of all major capital investment projects now under way which are either being&#13;
implemented or supported by RAO. A database and status report on each project will be&#13;
prepared covering progress to date, financing, and estimated time and resources required to&#13;
completion. For the most active and substantial projects, the advisor will ensure that&#13;
consistent data on estimated project costs, revenues and cash flows are available and are&#13;
presented in an accessible form for management review. The advisor will also develop and&#13;
implement a mechanism for the regular updating of the project database and the verification of&#13;
all data.&#13;
Task 2:     Development of an Updated Investment Program: The advisor will assist RAO&#13;
to develop an updated investment program, including both the completion of ongoing projects&#13;
and the initiation.of new projects currently in the investment program. The advisor will:&#13;
-  review work which has been done to date on analyzing the costs and benefits of projects in&#13;
the investment pipeline;&#13;
*  report to management on projects where more detailed analysis is needed or desirable in&#13;
order to establish the project's feasibility;&#13;
-  within the context of the current Russian economic framework and outlook, review the&#13;
overall investment program to assess whether other projects not currently planned or pro-&#13;
posed should be considered as priority candidates and carry out a screening-level analysis&#13;
to determine whether they warrant immediate consideration;&#13;
*  prepare a ranking of projects (or groups of projects) in their order of priority based on&#13;
both economic returns and on financial returns to the implementing agencies;&#13;
In addition, because the partially completed Bureya hydro power station is of particular&#13;
concern to the Government and to RAO, the advisor will develop detailed terms of reference&#13;
for further work which is needed in order to provide a bankable feasibility study of the project&#13;
and will, through a competitive process, contract with a suitable group of qualified consultants&#13;
to carry out the work necessary to complete the feasibility analysis of the project. This&#13;
feasibility analysis would also be financed under the World Bank loan.&#13;
Task 3:     Development of a Project Financing Plan:&#13;
* examine possible sources of financing for key projects now in the development program, as&#13;
identified by management, including but not limited to internal cash generation, commer-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-    -                             Appendix 3&#13;

cial or development bank financing, and private equity participation (domestic and/or&#13;
foreign);&#13;
*  identify possible barriers to accessing sufficient capital to carry out the proposed projects,&#13;
and suggest ways in which these barriers might be overcome;&#13;
*  consider the implications of the proposed new sector structure on both the ranking of&#13;
investment projects and on the potential sources of financing.&#13;
As part of this task, the advisor will also be expected to assist RAO in developing&#13;
principles for pricing of generation and transmission services, which will form the basis for&#13;
discussions with the regulatory agencies.&#13;
Task 4:     Investment Planning Procedures: Assist in developing a comprehensive and&#13;
systematic set of procedures for the preparation and evaluation of 'bankable' investment&#13;
projects, and ensure that the staff of RAO's investment division fully understand these&#13;
procedures and can implement them in the future. Preparation and evaluation procedures&#13;
should include:&#13;
*  preparation of market forecasts, including analysis of price elasticity;&#13;
*  least-cost evaluation of alternative resources available to meet demands (including both&#13;
demand-side and supply-side options);&#13;
-  enviromnental impact assessment and development of mitigation plans;&#13;
-  detai]Led planning, scheduling and cost estimating;&#13;
-  project risk analysis and risk mitigation planning;&#13;
3  evaluation of project financial viability;&#13;
&#149;  development of financing plans;&#13;
*  cash flow and rate-of-return analysis;&#13;
*  development of implementation plans.&#13;
In addition, as RAO management is decentralized, the advisor shall assist the headquar-&#13;
ters staff to develop, train and monitor the Economics and Investment staff within each major&#13;
RAO business unit.&#13;
TIMINGr&#13;
The advisor would be expected to begin work within four weeks of the signing of the&#13;
contract. Task 1 should be substantively completed within one month of commencing work.&#13;
The preliminary ranking of investment projects and the financing plan should be completed&#13;
within a nine-moiith period from project inception. Overall, the expected duration of the&#13;
assignment is expected to be one year.&#13;

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNICATIONS&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
In 1992, the Russian Government carried out a partial restructuring of the power&#13;
sector, establishing RAO EES Rossii (RAO) as a nation wide holding company for government&#13;
stakeholdings in generation, transmission and distribution assets. At the same time, local&#13;
distribution companies (Energos) were established in each region, retaining ownership of the&#13;
smaller generating plants, and supplying both electricity and heat, on a monopoly basis, to&#13;
final consumers. While the industry structure has successfully maintained reliable power&#13;
supply during a difficult economic period, a number of deficiencies have come to light with&#13;
respect to the manner in which the sector now operates. These include high operating costs,&#13;
inadequate cash generation, and inadequate investment to meet current and expected needs. In&#13;
order to address these shortcomings, the Government has adopted a concept for the reform and&#13;
restructuring of the power sector and has requested a loan from the World Bank to finance&#13;
technical assistance in support of further developing and implementing a restructuring&#13;
implementation plan. A Supervisory Board on Electricity Reform has been established under&#13;
the First Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Natural Monopolies, to provide oversight and&#13;
policy guidance to the process. In addition, an Electricity Reform Implementation Unit&#13;
(ERIU) is being established to manage the review and implementation process, and at the same&#13;
time to manage the technical assistance which will be provided.&#13;
I'he scope of the reform and restructuring concept is extensive, involving substantive&#13;
changes in the way in which the sector operates and sector participants interrelate with each&#13;
other, customers, and the general public. Considerable effort will be required to ensure that&#13;
information regarding the process is disseminated in a timely and accurate manner, that all&#13;
interested parties have an opportunity to put forward their concerns and viewpoints, and are&#13;
satisfied that their viewpoints have been taken into account. To provide support to this&#13;
process, the services of an advisor on public participation and communications are required.&#13;
OBJECTIVE&#13;
The objective of this assignment is to assist the ERIU in the design and execution of a&#13;
comprehensive communications and public participation process, aimed at ensuring that&#13;
interested parties are adequately informed about the reform and restructuring process and have&#13;
an opportunity to participate in a timely and effective manner.&#13;

            Russian Federation - Electricity Sector
            Reform Support Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Electricity Sector
            Reform Support Project is to lay the groundwork for
            improving the short- and long-term efficiency of the Russian
            electricity sector, thereby ensuring the reliable supply of
            electricity to the population and to economic entities at
            competitive prices. The project will finance foreign and
            Russian advisors to work with the various sector entities
            and government agencies and with the Electricity Reform
            Implementation Unit to implement the reform agenda.
            Technical assistance will comprise three broad categories:
            (1) further refining and developing the government's
            concept for reform and elaborating a detailed implementation
            plan and schedule for its realization, including an analysis
            of technical and institutional barriers to meeting
            objectives and identifying alternative solutions; (2)
            helping to carry out the activities needed to implement the
            plan; and (3) supporting the development of electricity
            sector entities, including commercializing operating
            companies and increasing their corporation-orientation, and
            strengthening regulators institutionally.
