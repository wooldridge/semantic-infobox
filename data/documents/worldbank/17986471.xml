&amp;#12;                            Frank Potter&#13;
                           July 19, 1993&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I'm William Becker with George Washington University and&#13;
&#13;
the Business History Group.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And I'm David Milobsky from The World Bank Historian's&#13;
&#13;
Office.&#13;
&#13;
A:   And I am Frank Potter, the person being interviewed.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Okay, very good.    Mr. Potter, I wonder if you 1 d begin by&#13;
&#13;
just talking very briefly about your educational background.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, I am Canadian.     I did my primary and secondary&#13;
education in Canada.    I joined the Canadian Forces when I&#13;
&#13;
graduated from high school as a cadet and went to the British&#13;
equivalent of West Point.     I served as an officer and then&#13;
went back and did one year of finance at Queens University in&#13;
&#13;
canada.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And after your military career, what was your career in&#13;
&#13;
Canada?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I left the military after five years of service as a&#13;
&#13;
junior officer.    I then joined a bank as a management&#13;
&#13;
trainee.   For the next three years, I moved from one part of&#13;
&#13;
the bank to the other before my first management job in&#13;
&#13;
ottawa.    I then became a manager of a branch.   Later in my&#13;
&#13;
career, I was sent to London and spent the next ten years&#13;
&#13;
serving abroad in London, Dusseldorf, Zurich, and Beirut.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What aspects of your banking experiences best prepared&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Potter, Page 2&#13;
you for the ED position here at the Bank?&#13;
A:   Well, I don't think I was very well prepared, frankly.&#13;
I had some contact with the Bank during my career in finance.&#13;
Before I came here I was running the international operations&#13;
of a bank in Canada, and a large part of our business&#13;
entailed international lending.    We were busy, as most others&#13;
were in the '70s and â&#128;¢sos, lending money, and it was de&#13;
rigueur to attend the Annual Meetings of the Bank.     It was a&#13;
convenient place to meet people.    We didn't do much business&#13;
with the Bank, so my knowledge of the institution was quite&#13;
superficial.&#13;
     I was asked by Canada's newly formed Conservative&#13;
Government to serve as an ED.     They thought that having&#13;
someone from the private sector at a place like the World&#13;
Bank would be a good idea.   I accepted the appointment and&#13;
discovered that the financial management skills that one&#13;
practices in a commercial banking or an investment banking&#13;
climate were not the tools and skills that one needs here.&#13;
I'm not suggesting that they are absolutely unimportant, but&#13;
they are not fundamental to success of this institution.&#13;
Q:   After arriving and getting a sense of the job, what did&#13;
you initially think that you wanted to accomplish as the ED?&#13;
Q:   I'm not sure I had a clear-cut notion of what I wanted&#13;
to do.   I was surprised when I came here by the relationship&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Potter, Page 3&#13;
&#13;
that existed between the Board and the management.     I was not&#13;
&#13;
accustomed to a Board behaving as this Board behaves.        I was&#13;
&#13;
not accustomed to managers who treat their board of directors&#13;
&#13;
in the manner of the Bank's managers.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I think we know what you mean.     Are you getting at the&#13;
&#13;
fact that the Board is on site, which is unusual in the&#13;
&#13;
private sector?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, it depends on which private sector you're talking&#13;
&#13;
about.   There's a long tradition in Europe, including the UK,&#13;
&#13;
of having Executive Boards.     I think most of the merchant&#13;
&#13;
banks are managed by executive boards.     The difference&#13;
&#13;
between those executive boards and ours is that an executive&#13;
&#13;
director on a European, private sector board actually runs&#13;
&#13;
part of the business.     He might be run the underwriting&#13;
&#13;
business, or the administrative side of the bank, or&#13;
&#13;
whatever, but he also sits as a director.     The Board here is&#13;
&#13;
called an Executive Board, but it's members don't have&#13;
&#13;
executive responsibilities.     It's a full-time resident board&#13;
&#13;
in a classic American sense.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   An advisory board?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.   Although that's not what the Articles say.      The&#13;
&#13;
Artic.les say something quite different.    They say that the&#13;
&#13;
Board is responsible for the operations of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But, in fact, over time, the management has taken over&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Potter, Page 4&#13;
the operations of the Bank.&#13;
A:   Yes.   Yes.     I think with good reason.&#13;
Q:   I'd like to turn to the other side of this relationship,&#13;
and that is the fact that, as the Canadian ED, you really&#13;
have responsibilities for a whole series of other countries&#13;
in addition to canada.     My question has to do with the&#13;
difficulty of balancing the interests of such a broad&#13;
constituency.      What have you found the difficulties to be?&#13;
A:   I would say that difficulties of that kind are largely&#13;
non-existent.      I don't regard it as my job to manage the&#13;
institution's relationship with the constituency.      That's why&#13;
we have line managers, and they come to me if they have a&#13;
problem with the countries, or the countries come to me if&#13;
they have a problem with the managers.      Those problems arise&#13;
very infrequently.     As a result, I pay very little attention&#13;
to conflicts within my constituency.      I don't try to put&#13;
myself in the middle because I don't think it's my job.        We&#13;
have 13 countries in this constituency, one of which follows&#13;
the affairs of the Bank very closely.      Another, the Irish,&#13;
who follow the affairs of the Bank but only at a very broad&#13;
level.   Only the major policy issues are of interest to the&#13;
Irish.   The other eleven shareholders, frankly, don't have&#13;
the resources to follow the Bank.     They can't read what we&#13;
send them, and we don't expect them to follow it.      We send&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Potter, Page 5&#13;
&#13;
someone down there, together with our colleagues from the&#13;
&#13;
Monetary Fund, three or four weeks before the Annual Meetings&#13;
&#13;
to brief them on the agenda and what the issues are, but&#13;
&#13;
that's our only point of contact with the countries that make&#13;
&#13;
up my constituency.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You have line managers, then, who deal with the&#13;
&#13;
countries in your constituency.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Within the Canadian government, who do you work with?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The Treasury?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   could you talk a little bit about how that works?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The connections between my office and the Treasury are&#13;
&#13;
very loose.   I have been instructed once in eight and a half&#13;
&#13;
years.   That was on China.    There was a G-7 declaration and&#13;
&#13;
they felt obliged to issue instructions.     But otherwise,&#13;
&#13;
Treasury does not try to influence our office's decisions&#13;
&#13;
very often.   If Treasury has views on something, I get to&#13;
&#13;
know about them.     Obviously, I have some interest in seeing&#13;
&#13;
that they remain happy, but I decide how I vote when I go to&#13;
&#13;
the Soard.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Speaking of the Board and your work within the Board,&#13;
&#13;
with whom among the other EDs do you work most closely?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Potter, Page 6&#13;
A:   That's hard to say.       The G-7 Directors tend to convene&#13;
fairly often, and we get to know each other a little better.&#13;
In the final analysis, however, it really comes down to&#13;
personalities.     I feel that I have the best relationships&#13;
with those directors whose personalities resonate with mine.&#13;
Q:   Okay.   Let's move on to another subject.      How has the&#13;
Board of Directors changed during your tenure?       You've been&#13;
here for nine years.&#13;
A:   I think there's been a revolution.       When I came here at&#13;
the beginning of    â&#128;¢as,   we used to approve all of the projects.&#13;
We'd get a project, (an irrigation project in China, for&#13;
example) and the staff would tell us how many hectares would&#13;
be irrigated, how many cubic meters of water would be pumped,&#13;
how big the pumps were, and how deep the trenches were, all&#13;
of which was beyond the grasp of--I would say--everyone on&#13;
the Board.   There was nothing we could add to those projects.&#13;
Nevertheless, we did about 250 of them, and then we did&#13;
another couple of hundred in the IFC.       That constituted the&#13;
bulk of our work.    We did do things like budgets and so on,&#13;
but still, the Board mainly dealt with transactions, which is&#13;
a little like watching a parade go by through a keyhole.       We&#13;
didn't get a very good view of what was going on.       We tried&#13;
for a long while to re-orientate the Board so that it would&#13;
stand back and examine the relationship between the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Potter, Page 7&#13;
&#13;
institution and the country.   It took a long, long while to&#13;
&#13;
do that because the Part II Directors were nervous.&#13;
&#13;
Management encouraged them to believe that discussing policy&#13;
&#13;
issues at Board meetings would politicize the body and hinder&#13;
&#13;
the flow of aid to needy countries.   Management argued that&#13;
&#13;
such a situation would lead to polarization and inefficiency,&#13;
&#13;
thus undermining the Bank's efforts to help the needy.&#13;
&#13;
     We tried five or six years ago, under the British&#13;
&#13;
Director, Tim Lanbester, to broaden the range of Board&#13;
&#13;
discussions, but we failed--partly because he was transferred&#13;
&#13;
before his committee finished its work.   It was taken over by&#13;
&#13;
its Brazilian Vice Chairman, a man who held the position only&#13;
&#13;
because otherwise he would have been an articulate, energetic&#13;
&#13;
opponent to the Lancaster Committee's work.   We didn't expect&#13;
&#13;
that he was going to end up chairing the committee, but he&#13;
&#13;
did, and so the outcome was sanitized.&#13;
&#13;
     The next stage was to use a different avenue, which was&#13;
&#13;
the SAF over at the Fund, which resulted in a document which&#13;
&#13;
straddled Nineteenth Street and obliged the Bank to talk&#13;
&#13;
about country policy.   That was the Policy Framework Paper,&#13;
&#13;
which was innocuous in an operational sense, but it was still&#13;
&#13;
a foo"t in the door, or the thin edge of the wedge.&#13;
&#13;
     After the establishment of the PFP, we spent a couple of&#13;
&#13;
years talking about country circumstances in a policy&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Potter, Page 8&#13;
framework and then went to work on IDA 9 and basically&#13;
obliged the Bank to do it.     The G-7 had a dinner with Ernie&#13;
stern in Copenhagen and said that conducting Board&#13;
discussions within a general policy framework would be a&#13;
condition of IDA 9 1 s success.   Management knew we had the&#13;
votes, so it met our demands.     We initiated policy&#13;
discussions in IDA, and not only were they uncontroversial,&#13;
they were actually quite constructive.     Later, in IDA 10, we&#13;
were able to extend this framework for discussion into all&#13;
Bank issues.     This shift in focus, in my view, has&#13;
transformed the character of the Board enormously.          Now it's&#13;
talking about policy and governance, without getting bogged&#13;
down with transactional details.&#13;
Q:   As a result of these changes in the responsibilities of&#13;
the Board, do you feel that the Board has taken on, more&#13;
power?&#13;
A:   No.   I   don't think it's taken on more power.    I   think&#13;
it's calling the right things to account.     It's requiring&#13;
managers to articulate the reasons for which they do things.&#13;
That is the Board's primary mission, and it's starting to&#13;
follow through on it.&#13;
Q:   "In this newer context, are there increased tensions&#13;
between donors and borrowers?&#13;
A:   No.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Potter, Page 9&#13;
&#13;
Q:   No?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.   In fact, I was sitting at the Board last Thursday,&#13;
&#13;
thinking to myself, "My God, this has turned out well."        We&#13;
&#13;
were dealing with Slovenia; it was a very interesting&#13;
&#13;
transaction.    It was a pair of policy-based loans, one of&#13;
&#13;
which was to set about the business of privatizing state&#13;
&#13;
enterprises, and the other dealt with the financial sector.&#13;
&#13;
During the discussion, a debate developed between a gentleman&#13;
&#13;
from Myanmar, a gentleman from Argentina, and the Swiss&#13;
&#13;
representative.     At that moment, if you closed your eyes and&#13;
&#13;
didn't know the voices, you wouldn't have known where these&#13;
&#13;
people came from.     It was a debate that represented what we&#13;
&#13;
wanted Board discussions to be, an objective examination of&#13;
&#13;
where the country is, what its choices are, why it made those&#13;
&#13;
choices, and how and what we are doing to complement or&#13;
&#13;
reinforce the policy.     I think it's turned out to be very&#13;
&#13;
constructive and remarkably uncontroversial.     I can't think&#13;
&#13;
of one instance when anybody has brought any sort of&#13;
&#13;
political baggage to the table.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How about the relationships between the Board and&#13;
&#13;
management?    You seemed to imply that it's improved as a&#13;
&#13;
result of this transformation.     Has anything really changed&#13;
&#13;
as a result of this broadening of the range of issues that&#13;
&#13;
the Board discusses now?     Has that relationship between the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Potter, Page 10&#13;
Board and management changed?&#13;
A:   I don't know.    I sense that it's a little better these&#13;
days, but I think that's because we have a President who's&#13;
got a couple of years under his belt.     He is beginning to&#13;
understand that this is an institution that's owned by&#13;
governments, and that it deals with an agenda which is of&#13;
acute political interest to all.      All of its work is&#13;
important, and it's going to be debated.     We are not going to&#13;
hand the car keys to any president.      No management team on&#13;
this earth would be given the agenda of The World Bank and&#13;
asked to produce an annual report once a year.     It's too&#13;
important.    In short, I think we have a President who is now&#13;
more comfortable with the nature of this place and therefore&#13;
some of the tensions between Preston and the Directors aren't&#13;
quite as acute as they might have been.    They were acute in&#13;
the early days.&#13;
Q:   Do you see any tension between the EDs 1 commitment to&#13;
represent the views of their respective governments within&#13;
the Bank and their responsibility to sell the Bank's policy&#13;
initiatives to their home governments?&#13;
A:   Yes.    Although I don't like the way you frame the&#13;
question.&#13;
Q:   Well, why don't you frame it?&#13;
A:   Well, I would say that the conflict is obvious,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Potter, Page 11&#13;
&#13;
unavoidable, and irreparable.     The intensity of the conflict&#13;
&#13;
varies with the number of countries in an ED's constituency.&#13;
&#13;
The more countries you represent, the more you can ignore&#13;
&#13;
them.     Clearly, if you represent one government it's much&#13;
&#13;
tougher.     Those Directors are on a much shorter leash,&#13;
&#13;
usually.&#13;
&#13;
        The Board is the weakest part of this institution.     Too&#13;
&#13;
many directors see themselves as advocates of individual&#13;
&#13;
shareholder interests.     That reinforces, in my view, a set of&#13;
&#13;
notions which don't help the institution.       If you go to the&#13;
&#13;
Board and represent a particular shareholder interest, you&#13;
&#13;
are acting like an ambassador, and ambassadors deliver&#13;
&#13;
instructions.     Ambassadors are highly respected, but they are&#13;
&#13;
outsiders.     A Director, on the other hand, has a duty to the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     He represents all the shareholders.   However, when you&#13;
&#13;
have governments that consider that they own the place (which&#13;
&#13;
they do) , and if they go beyond the conventional behavior of&#13;
&#13;
shareholders (which they do), you have a dilemma.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Can you think of one specific example of this kind of&#13;
&#13;
dilemma?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Oh, it happens every day around here.   I did not have&#13;
&#13;
any support to vote for the budget a month ago, for example.&#13;
&#13;
If I asked Ottawa, they, clearly, would have voted against&#13;
&#13;
the budget for all the wrong reasons.     They didn't want to be&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Potter, Page 12&#13;
seen to be supporting the extravagances of Bank executives.&#13;
It happens all the time.&#13;
Q:    For the last six or seven months you've been the Dean of&#13;
the Directors.   Has that in any way given you a unique&#13;
insight or perspective that you did not have before?&#13;
A:    I don't think it's changed my perspective.    It has&#13;
obliged me to be more mellow than I would be otherwise.&#13;
Q:    In what regard?&#13;
A:    Well, I don't think that I should take strongly partisan&#13;
positions if it looks like arbitration will be needed.        I try&#13;
not to get too far off center.     I also gave up chairing the&#13;
G-10 and the G-7 when I became the Dean.     As a result, I&#13;
don't have the freedom to convene those groups that I used&#13;
to.&#13;
Q:    So you see the role of the Dean as a facilitator?&#13;
A:    He should be the principal intermediary between the&#13;
management and the Board when there are delicate issues that&#13;
require discussion.     Fellow Directors often ask him to&#13;
encourage other Directors to do certain things--to make less&#13;
windy interventions at the Board, and so on.     He also has an&#13;
influence in selecting the members of the various committees,&#13;
and that's a source of some responsibility.     In addition, he&#13;
negotiates the President's salary every two and a half years.&#13;
That's important because it effectively acts as a cap on the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Potter, Page 13&#13;
&#13;
salary structures of the entire Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you think that your perception of the Dean's&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities is different from that of your predecessors?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.   I think so.     It's very difficult to be an&#13;
&#13;
independent Part II Director, if you represent countries that&#13;
&#13;
are major borrowers.      You are simply too vulnerable to the&#13;
&#13;
institution.   Coming from a background that does not create&#13;
&#13;
that vulnerability allows me to be more independent as Dean.&#13;
&#13;
     Although the weaknesses of the Board baffle me, I&#13;
&#13;
continue to try to think of ways to fix them because I think&#13;
&#13;
that a weak Board is not going to serve the institution's&#13;
&#13;
interests well.   I think we are heading into a period of&#13;
&#13;
tough times for these institutions, and having satisfied&#13;
&#13;
shareholders is more important than it's ever been.        We need&#13;
&#13;
a set of relationships which show that someone is respecting&#13;
&#13;
their views, particularly with regard to costs.      We haven't&#13;
&#13;
got that yet, but we are making progress.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What else needs to be done?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I would change the Rules of Procedure for the Board,&#13;
&#13;
which I regard as being simply inexplicable.      The Board can&#13;
&#13;
meet only if the Chairman allows it to meet.       Can you tell&#13;
&#13;
me whÂ·ere else in the world that exists?    We have a Board&#13;
&#13;
that's unable to function, according to the Rules of&#13;
&#13;
Procedure, without the approval of the Chief Executive&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Potter, Page 14&#13;
Officer.     That isn't right.&#13;
     The Rules of Procedure require that all recommendations&#13;
for committee memberships be submitted to the Chairman.           As a&#13;
result, the very committees which are there to oversee the&#13;
management are subject to approval by the management.        If I&#13;
were staying here, I would push to have all the senior&#13;
managers of the institution on contract, subject to approval&#13;
by the Board.     Contract renewal would also be subject to&#13;
Board approval.     I would also push the President to conduct&#13;
an annual review of the senior managers' performance.        We are&#13;
doing that now, but only because this President is willing to&#13;
do it.     I want to make it a permanent part of the Bank's&#13;
operating procedures.     I feel that it's the Board's&#13;
responsibility to push for measures like these because a&#13;
Board that's not prepared to call management to account and&#13;
make changes is not a Board that's doing its job.&#13;
Q:   How would you propose to measure managerial performance?&#13;
A:   Every job has a job description.     Why can't we rate the&#13;
Managing Director or Vice President?     We rate everybody else&#13;
in the Bank.     You rate your secretary, don't you?     There are&#13;
a certain number of things that he or she should do.        You&#13;
decide whether they are being done well, and you give himjher&#13;
a grade, supplemented by a few summary comments.       You say&#13;
that Smith has done a good job this year, or he hasn't.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Potter, Page 15&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You've mentioned President Preston in some of your&#13;
&#13;
comments and I'd like to turn to some of the other&#13;
&#13;
presidents.     We wanted to ask, in view of your opportunity to&#13;
&#13;
work with Presidents (Clausen, Conable and Preston), who&#13;
&#13;
would you rate as the most effective of the three?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, they were all good, but I have always thought that&#13;
&#13;
Tom Clausen deserved more credit than he got.           Many people&#13;
&#13;
overlook his handling of the debt crisis.           I would say that&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's response to the debt crisis was his&#13;
&#13;
administration's most lasting accomplishment.           Now, there are&#13;
&#13;
people who will tell you that the Bank lost out to the&#13;
&#13;
Monetary Fund during the debt crisis, but I don't think&#13;
&#13;
that's so.     The Bank underwent an enormous change in&#13;
&#13;
character in '81,    '82,   1   83.   A profound change of character.&#13;
&#13;
It was still happening when I got here.           If I may digress--&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Sure.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I think part of our problem here deals with our original&#13;
&#13;
mission.     The nature of our work, which was focused&#13;
&#13;
essentially on Western Europe, was orientated toward&#13;
&#13;
infrastructure, and reconstruction, and so on.           It was&#13;
&#13;
worthy, and it was important, but it was straightforward.              It&#13;
&#13;
was not something that engaged the attention of policy makers&#13;
&#13;
in capitals.     If you talk to someone with a long memory in a&#13;
&#13;
place like Ottawa, they will tell you that, from day one, the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Potter, Page 16&#13;
Monetary Fund was an institution that the capitals followed.&#13;
Its activities captured the central banks and treasuries'&#13;
interest.     The Bank's activities, on the other hand, were&#13;
interesting, but peripheral.        The Bank didn't ask them-for&#13;
money.     It didn't show any signs of embarrassing them.        In&#13;
short, it could be left alone, and it was left alone.           It was&#13;
a well-managed place which quietly went about its work.&#13;
        over the course of time, the Bank developed a tradition&#13;
of remarkable distance from the shareholders, a distance&#13;
which it didn't abuse, as far as I know.        The Bank was quite&#13;
vigorously managed and so the status quo prevailed.           With the&#13;
advent of the debt crisis    1&#13;
                                 82, however, we discovered&#13;
something that seemed obvious in retrospect--that good,&#13;
strong, forceful policy advocacy and reform was the&#13;
foundation for an effective intervention in Latin America.&#13;
Such an intervention required a lot of money, however, and&#13;
the Bank had it.     I don't think the shareholders really&#13;
realized that the capacity to deliver significant amounts&#13;
year after year was on this side of Nineteenth Street until&#13;
1982.     As a result, getting acquainted with the Bank became a&#13;
matter of some urgency.     Clausen handled the change quite&#13;
well,- so I give him high marks.&#13;
Q:      Was Barber conable very different?&#13;
A:      Yes, he spent his whole career in public life.        He was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Potter, Page 17&#13;
&#13;
raised on notions of compromise and accommodation.        He&#13;
&#13;
thought that getting along with people was important, and he&#13;
&#13;
was good at it.     He was well liked.     He undertook a quite&#13;
&#13;
radical examination of the Bank's circumstances, as you know.&#13;
&#13;
There are people who say he was put up to it.        I think they&#13;
&#13;
are right, but I think that, in the long run, it was good for&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.   He tried to listen to all sides and to understand&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's mission.       Conable was not a toady running an&#13;
&#13;
errand for the    u.s.   Treasury.   He honestly wanted the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization to result in a better Bank.        He tried.     And I&#13;
&#13;
think he succeeded, but I was not one of the casualties.             I&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't criticize people who have other views.        It was a&#13;
&#13;
difficult period for the Bank, but I think the institution&#13;
&#13;
adjusted well.&#13;
&#13;
     Conable was also a person who also had a very clear,&#13;
&#13;
genuine personal commitment to things that are important to&#13;
&#13;
the Bank--women in development, poverty orientation, and&#13;
&#13;
other social issues.       These are issues that will play&#13;
&#13;
prominently in the Bank's future, and Conable felt very&#13;
&#13;
comfortable with them.&#13;
&#13;
     Conable's management style tended to depend on too much&#13;
&#13;
consultation, and that got him into trouble.        It was clumsy&#13;
&#13;
and people were able to hide behind it and abuse it.           The&#13;
&#13;
Bank was not a crisp sort of place with good reflexes when&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Potter, Page 18&#13;
Barber was here, but, it was, certainly, a caring place.&#13;
Q:   And Preston?&#13;
A:   Ah, well, this man's a manager.       I think he's going to&#13;
be good for the Bank.       He and I got off to a bad start, but&#13;
I'm sure that we are going to have a good finish.         Large,&#13;
complex    or~anizations   don't intimidate him.    He's not afraid&#13;
to ask dumb questions, which is a great asset when facing&#13;
large, complicated agendas.       I think he's asked some very&#13;
good questions around the Bank, and his push for&#13;
accountability has been good for the institution.         He hasnâ&#128;¢t&#13;
gone far enough, in my view, but I think he will get there.&#13;
Q:   Have you seen some of that crispness that you thought&#13;
was lost during the Conable years sort of return under&#13;
Preston?&#13;
A:   Well, I think that our response to the controversy over&#13;
the new building last week reflects the way he does things.&#13;
The moment it came to his attention, he told us everything he&#13;
knew; he told us what he didnâ&#128;¢t know; he told us how he&#13;
intended to get to the bottom of it, and when he intended to&#13;
get to the bottom of it.       He did get to the bottom of it, in&#13;
my opinion.     This issue has been handled with a kind of&#13;
authoÂ·rity and discipline that I think is admirable.        It&#13;
doesn't come easily to these institutions.         I don't know&#13;
whether the right people have been put on administrative&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Potter, Page 19&#13;
&#13;
leave or not, but the action sent a strong message: "if you&#13;
&#13;
are a manager you will be held accountable for your actions."&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Do you think that it is harder to trace those&#13;
&#13;
accountabilities at the Bank than at other places?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No.   I think the Bank has a conventional hierarchy of&#13;
&#13;
authorities.     Measuring accountability is particularly hard&#13;
&#13;
here.     It's difficult to assess some of the policy work we do&#13;
&#13;
unless you want to wait a lifetime, but you can still compare&#13;
&#13;
performers with their peers.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      You suggested that, in the last budget, the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
appetites were being curtailed, and then you suggested that&#13;
&#13;
there were other areas that you hoped that Preston would&#13;
&#13;
address.      Could you mention those areas?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I don't think that we face any bitter debates over the&#13;
&#13;
general direction of policy at the Bank.       There are going to&#13;
&#13;
be skirmishes over the degree to which we aim resources at&#13;
&#13;
Eastern Europe, as opposed to our traditional clientele.&#13;
&#13;
However you do that, there's going to be a skirmish, but I&#13;
&#13;
think we've got that largely right.       I don't think, for&#13;
&#13;
example, that statements labelling our responses as timid and&#13;
&#13;
tentative are fair.      I think that we've done things the right&#13;
&#13;
way, and that the pressures that the shareholders have put on&#13;
&#13;
us (the G-7 particularly) is undeserved.&#13;
&#13;
        I think cost control should be near the top of the list.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Potter, Page 20&#13;
We've let our perquisites skip completely out of hand here.&#13;
They've gone past being generous.     They are indulgent.   They&#13;
create resentments, and jealousy, and I think they need&#13;
fixing.   This may seem to be one of those trivial issues&#13;
which people don't like to think about, but it's important.&#13;
I think our salaries are too high.     The Europeans may&#13;
disagree, but our salaries are interfering with our ability&#13;
to raise resources.   IDA is going to get tougher and tougher,&#13;
and I think we need a Bank that's going to get more and more&#13;
frugal.&#13;
Q:   Do you see Preston moving that way?&#13;
A:   Yes. I like the way he assigns responsibilities to&#13;
people.   He's a good delegator.    He lets people manage, which&#13;
is not easy to do in a politically-controlled institution.&#13;
Q:   I'd like to turn to another issue that's gained some&#13;
attention in the press, and that's the Wapenhans Report.       I&#13;
wonder if you would care to talk a little bit about your&#13;
reading of that report and its impact on the future of Bank&#13;
operations.&#13;
A:   Well, the Wapenhans Report is one of those things which&#13;
gives rise to conflicting notions if you work here.     On the&#13;
one hand, you can be very proud that the institution is&#13;
willing to take stock of itself so frankly.     On the other&#13;
hand, I think to myself, "It is so obvious.    Why haven't we&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Potter, Page 21&#13;
&#13;
done it until now?"   I don't know the answer to that, so&#13;
&#13;
please don't put the question to me.    I'll tell you that&#13;
&#13;
there is one person who's been asking that question for three&#13;
&#13;
or four years, who never got any credit in all of this, and&#13;
&#13;
that's the American Director, Pat Coady.     He was very&#13;
&#13;
tenacious about understanding what happened after projects&#13;
&#13;
got approved at the Board, and how we took stock of the&#13;
&#13;
quality at the end of the production line.     I'm not saying&#13;
&#13;
that he was the first to think of it, but he was certainly&#13;
&#13;
the most vocal in the last three or four years.     Preston&#13;
&#13;
called for that work to be done, and I think it will do&#13;
&#13;
nothing but good for the Bank.   Some people question how&#13;
&#13;
tightly the Bank will embrace the Report.    I'm not skeptical,&#13;
&#13;
however.   I think the Bank is going to try to change its&#13;
&#13;
spots.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you see the Board having an important role in&#13;
&#13;
implementing the Report's recommendations?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, their job is to be a court of adjudication.&#13;
&#13;
That's the way the system was designed.     I think that's a&#13;
&#13;
perfectly proper role for the Board; to take stock from time&#13;
&#13;
to time, in a disciplined way, of a new process and what the&#13;
&#13;
results of that process seem to be.    It should look at both&#13;
&#13;
its problems and its successes, searching for ways to avoid&#13;
&#13;
setbacks in the future.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Potter, Page 22&#13;
Q:      Do you think that there is a trade-off between the&#13;
volume of fresh commitments and fixing the portfolio?&#13;
A:      I think the conflict is inescapable.     Everybody sees&#13;
that it's inescapable.     I think that's why so many of our&#13;
Part II colleagues weren't sure that Wapenhans was such a&#13;
good idea, because clearly there's going to have to be a&#13;
point at which getting things fixed and taking stock is going&#13;
to lead to some slowdown in operations, and so the money is&#13;
not going to flow at the same pace.&#13;
Q:      I want to turn to a slightly different issue here, and&#13;
that is the question of promoting private sector development.&#13;
How would you rate the Bank Group's efforts to promote this&#13;
kind of development in the years that you've been here?&#13;
A:      Well, I have a standing fight with the   u.s. Director on&#13;
this.     I think that the Bank's record is quite good.       I'm&#13;
regularly surprised by the consistency of the Bank's&#13;
instincts.     The Bank's a complicated place.    It's part&#13;
university, part government, and part bank, so there's always&#13;
disagreement in this place.     There is very little consensus&#13;
here.     However, when you look closely at issues in the Bank&#13;
where there are choices to be made, I believe that, in a vast&#13;
majority of cases, the outcome reflects a trust in incentive&#13;
systems.     The Bank understands incentive systems, and it&#13;
understands the importance of creating the right kind of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Potter, Page 23&#13;
&#13;
climate for the development of private industry.        I think&#13;
&#13;
that most of the Bank's policy work is, in that respect, very&#13;
&#13;
sound.     I think the conundrum arises when you start thinking&#13;
&#13;
about IFC.     That's where the dilemma arises.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      In what sense?&#13;
&#13;
A:      They have an impossible mandate.   They are not expected&#13;
&#13;
to make investments which the private sector would not or&#13;
&#13;
should not make, yet they are not supposed to make dumb&#13;
&#13;
investments.     On the other hand, they are not supposed to&#13;
&#13;
make investments which displace the private sector.        That's a&#13;
&#13;
thin wire to walk.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What about the Bank's ability to reach out to the&#13;
&#13;
smaller investors in its client countries?        How would you&#13;
&#13;
rate that?     Has that been a key component of its drive to&#13;
&#13;
promote market incentives and trust in markets?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, the Bank has a long history of disappointing&#13;
&#13;
results in this area and has, I think rightly, given up the,&#13;
&#13;
the effort to intervene directly with small investors.        It&#13;
&#13;
sees its duty as contributing to a climate in which savers&#13;
&#13;
will save, investors will invest, and incentive systems will&#13;
&#13;
work.     The Bank is not going to use a microscope to aim some&#13;
&#13;
resources at small investors, because we've learned that we&#13;
&#13;
can't do that.     I don't think we can do it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Turning to some further questions here about your tenure&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Potter, Page 24&#13;
as ED, which of your accomplishments are you most pleased&#13;
with in your years as ED?&#13;
A:   Oh, dear.     That's embarrassing.   I don't know.   I've&#13;
tried to have my hand in on this policy orientation, as you&#13;
might have guessed, and I don't think that would have&#13;
happened had I not been so energetic.      I think I helped to&#13;
form the Peretz-Nairn Committee.    And I took an active hand in&#13;
choosing that Committee.&#13;
Q:   I also wanted to ask you about the issues that will have&#13;
the greatest impact on the Bank after your departure.&#13;
A:   If I were running the Bank, I would try to understand&#13;
how to do a better job with NGOs, and by that I don't mean&#13;
the NGOs within half a mile of this building.      I mean NGOs&#13;
everywhere, especially in our client countries.      Related to&#13;
that, the Bank needs to learn how to represent its own work&#13;
more effectively.     Over the next few years, the Bank is going&#13;
to become much more scrutinized, and it has to learn how to&#13;
promote its operations more effectively in a climate of&#13;
scarce financial resources, stiff competition and weak&#13;
economic prospects.&#13;
Q:   Thank you, very much.&#13;
A:   A pleasure.&#13;

            Transcript of oral history interview with
            Frank Potter held on July 19, 1993
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In July 1993, Frank Potter was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by W. Becker and D. Milobsky. During his
